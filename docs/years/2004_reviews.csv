682603,"As the result of a wager between native hothead Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) and the racist Capt. Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the inhabitants of an impoverished Indian village must defeat the local British troops in a cricket match in order to escape from the crippling tax that is levied by the imperialists.  This hugely entertaining film is both familiar and exotic.  All of the conventions of the traditional sports film and love triangle are present and few will be surprised by any of the developments in the story.  However, since this is my first Bollywood film (as it will be for most American viewers), it benefits from the foreign milieu as well as the exhuberance and talent of the performers.  It took a while for me to get into the spirit of the musical numbers with their clearly dubbed vocals, but I was soon captivated by those as well.  Beneath all of the comedy, romance, music, and clearly defined heroes and villains, there is a serious aspect to the story-the repression of native people by colonial forces.  Gracy Singh, as Bhuvan's childhood sweetheart, is absolutely charming./",Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India
757123,"I bought this DVD with no further knowldge of the movie than it was a Carrie film. I personally own the Special Edition of the 1976 version, the 1999 sequel, and now this little number. I am currently in search of the '76 soundtrack.This TV version falls under the same category as the Sci-Fi sequel to ""Firestarter,"" but definitely holds more value to Carrie fanatics like myself.First off, this vesion is more inclusive as far as holding true to the novel. The camerawork, one might notice, is a tad amateur, but behind the special effects, brilliant performances (especially on Bettis and Clarkson's part), and music that strangely resembles that of the original films--one hardly notices the flaws of this ""modern remake.""The DVD contains no special features, regrettably, but does have some MGM trailers that might encourage you to visit the video store.Have fun,GIGI",N/A
799176,"This is a worthy ending to this series.  While I tired somewhat of the cowboy stuff that naturally accompanies a climax, the dark vision and ambiguous ending of the film mark it as truly outstanding sci-fi.  Sure, the ending was happy, but troubles for the future are very clearly in the making.  The greatest surprize of all is the maintenance of the cryptic - and logically consistent - references that were so much fun in the 2nd part.  Moreover, it is never fully explained, but left to the imaginative to puzzle out, if they so wish.  Indeed, there are added delicious mysteries, like the little Indian girl and the transforamtion of the oracle.REcommended for serious fans of sci-fi.",N/A
160861,"Notwithstanding his having been a great man, Gandhi is not necessarily an example for our times. This is a beautifully made film; one of the most moving ever made, but not for its perceived ""Lessons"".  Rather, this film is great for what makes any film great: wonderful acting (phenomenal on Mr. Kingsley's part), skilled direction, great camera cinematography, lighting, editing, and pace.  The sceenplay and story, of course, are highly contributory herein, but even were this fiction the film would still qualify as a great film.  It is simply a great film however you look at it. You needn't read too much into this film to enjoy it; or see in Gandhi's example, say, a panacea of sorts for our world of today.  Passive non-violent resistance worked for Gandhi first in South Africa (to some extent) and then India mostly because his adversary was a civilized one.  Gandhi, let's remember, basically used British law against the British themselves.  He was able to succeed not simply because his cause was noble and/or because passive resistance is inherently effective.  I grant you that his campaign was a brilliant one, skillfully engineered; but against most any other country save Britain, it would have only ""ended before it began,"" as former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky says in his book ""The Case for Democracy""; most likely in Gandhi's death or  disappearance. [...] I have read Gandhi's autobiography and I give him his just due. I'm just saying that Imperial Britain's historic traditions and norms of behavior had an important role herein as well, and this ought be recognized (and no, I'm not British myself). Gandhi is an example in one way (and maybe we'll see the likes of another Gandhi somewhere, someday), but ""His Example"" isn't one we should deceive ourselves as being applicable across the board within the chaotic world in which we live.  In short, this film is a superb treatment of an important historical episode (particular to a rather specific period and set of circumstances) and, as such, well worth your time viewing. Cheers!",N/A
797362,I watched this film because one of my favorite rides of all time is Disney's &quot;Haunted Mansion.&quot; I have to say the only reason I really enjoyed this film was for the special effects and memories of all those old spooky ghosts from the original ride at Disneyland.Eddie Murphy plays an overly ambitious real estate agent who ends up at the mansion with his family trying to strike up a deal with a few ghosts. The story is horribly hokey! The acting is silly and filled with typical Murphy antics: silly laughing and funny smiles.The best part of this movie is the special effects and the graveyard scenes. I found the movie to be a bit scary for children as some of the zombies are very &quot;real&quot; looking. For adults it is an evening of silly fun but sadly for young children they might spend their evening with nightmares instead of giggles!,N/A
808077,"When I first heard about this movie I was sceptical. I was afraid that a Samurai movie starring a white guy might end up kind of goofy. But Tom Cruise puts in a strong performance here and won me over by the end of the film. If you love swords this is the movie for you. Tons of training with swords, fighting with swords, and philosiphising about them. The action is spectacular, and the score is stirring. The cinemtography is beautiful. The mountain village reminded me of the shire and made me want to live there. For a movie with some brutally violent action sequences, it also features some amazingly peaceful and relaxing moments in the middle of the film. Anyone who believes in honor and chivalry will find this movie inspiring.Est Sularus Oth Mithas!",N/A
565886,"I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA is one hilarious film; even though many of the jokes fall flat at times, the whole is superlative tongue in cheek satire.  A broad humored satire of those wonderful 70's &quot;black exploitation&quot; films, Wayans and crew serve up scene after scene of hilarity.  For instance:  a sleazy girl is singing a sultry version of &quot;When the Saints Come Marching In,&quot; and when Wayans asks who she is, the waitress says &quot;She's the director's sister.&quot;  (She is!).  When ex-football star Jim Brown asks Wayans why he thinks he's qualified to be a black hero, Wayans tells him &quot;I'm an ex football player.&quot;  When Dawnn Lewis as Wayans' sweetie gets the cramps, she really gets cranky!!  John Vernon as Mr. Big spouts off why shouldn't he be in a black exploitation movie, other actors have!  There are so many scenes like this that one can't help but laugh and laugh again.Featuring a cavalcade of black and white actors, including Clarence Williams III, Isaac Hayes, Ja'net Dubois, Antonio Fargas and Steve James, I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA is a hoot to watch!",N/A
404191,"I'm sorry, but this IS just another 80's slasher flick.  There is nothing outstanding about Maniac - nothing that elevates it or distinguishes it from all the other films of this type to come out during this decade.  I simply do not understand the reverence felt by many horror fans for this silly, low-budget schlock.  I know I will get slammed with non-helpful votes from people who have already seen it and like it, (in which case I don't see how my review could be helpful or otherwise...) but I hope to possibly dissuade others from making the same mistake I did by purchasing this movie.Joe Spinell plays Frank Zito, our whining, groaning, grunting maniac.  His Mommy locked him in a closet a lot when he was a child and turned him into a self-hating misogynist - well, that and a homicidal schizophrenic.  Frank scalps his victims and uses these scalps as wigs for his beloved mannequins.  That's the premise.  There is also a lazy attempt at a story involving a beautiful photographer who I suppose represents redemption?  Rehabilitation?  A last chance for the violent schizo to rejoin civilized society?The script is pretty awful and it's interpretation by the actors does not help matters.  Spinell's performance is hokey and self-conscious.  However, contrasted with his supporting cast (I think the mannequines gave better performances than Caroline Munroe) he is friggin Olivier.The scene in which Zito stalks and kills the nurse is the most effective sequence in the film.  However, it is nearly ruined by completely unnecessary and ridiculous over-dubbing.  Whatever the problems with live sound might have been, silence would have worked better.  This superfluous dubbing of grunts, gasps, whimpers and heavy breathing does not add to, but rather negates completely, the desired effect of suspense and dread.  The same goes for the voiceover (in lieu of flashback) that explains the abuse Frank suffered from his mother:Little Frank (played by worst child actor in the world): &quot;No Mommy, please.  Please don't lock me in the closet.&quot;Mommy (played by worst actress in the history of theatre):  &quot;You must be punished.  You have been bad again.&quot;Little Frank:  &quot;No Mommy, please.  Please, please don't lock me in the closet.  Please.Mommy:  &quot;You must be punished.  You have been bad...&quot; and on and on and on.  There are other embarrassing moments in the film, but this one is special.Tom Savini's effects are very good, although the movie is not nearly as gory as I expected it to be.  Some of the shots of the mannequines at the end are nice.  But overall, the gritty, nasty feel that was so obviously desired was sabotaged by a bad script and bad acting.  Great acting is not essential for a good low-budget movie.  But if the acting is bad, then your script must be fantastic, or your premise, or your visuals, or something.  There is some good gore here.  That's about it.If you want to see a dark, gritty, and excellent movie about a serial killer, rent or buy Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.  Abel Ferrara's Driller Killer is not bad either.",Maniac VHS
826943,"I got this DVD last sunday and I got to say what a great DVD! ""Hard Knocks"" tells you all about Benoit like how he got into wrestling, how Dynamite Kid was his big infulence, how he started his training in Stu Harts Dungeon. This also gives use matches from Chris Benoit in Japen, ECW, WCW and WWE. It also shows the match on Chris Benoit got his name The Cripppler where he broke Sabu's neck.The extras on the DVD are cool because it has Benoit matches against Eddie Guerreo, Booker T, Sid Vicous, Bret Hart and many more. This also features Benoits big match at Wrestlemania 20 against Triple H and Shawn Michaels in a triple threat for the World Heavyweight Championship. Benoit wins the big one at Wrestlemania 20 and it took him 18 years to get there. So if your a Chirs Benoit fan or just a Wrestling Fan this is the DVD to pick up and add to your collection!",N/A
684027,"After reading the reviews and seeing the sound bites of reviewers in the DVD package, I set forth to buy Bangkok Dangerous. I was expecting a ""hyperkinetic"" movie, as one critic put it and a cinematic style that's ""similar to John Woo and Quentin Tarantino"". I got neither. What I got is a languidly paced film about a deaf-mute hitman eager to redeem himself for a pretty young pharmacist's love. Actually, that's the most interesting part of the movie, how the hitman communicates his love to Fon, the pharmacist. The gunplay, action, the pacing and the camera techniques are nowhere near what critics are comparing it to. There's no gimmicky non-linear storytelling. No ""kewl"" camera work. No ""hip"" editing. It is not like Tsui Hark's Time & Tide with its visually-stunning camera work and dense storytelling, instead it is more akin to Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai. Quiet, a little profound. The story is refreshingly simple but it kind of drags on in the middle, plodding to the point of predictable, it makes you wish it has one of those twists Thai TV commercials are known for in global advertising awards shows. All in all, Bangkok Dangerous is a refreshing film to see amidst the noisy action films of Hollywood and Hong Kong. But don't get misled by what's on the cover.",N/A
260364,"There's something about &quot;Beneath&quot; that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The plot is pretty standard fare. Two astronauts (neither played by Charlton Heston) stumble upon that infamous monkey planet and discover that those pesky apes are STILL trying to wipe out the last traces of humanity. The costumes (not stunning in the prequel) look even more fake this time around. It's HARD to suspend your belief when the apes look like people running around in ape costumes!Then we get to the subterranean scenes. Our surviving astronaut meets Nova (expertly played by a scantily-clad Linda Harrison) and a cult of nuke-worshipping mutants who sing praises to the &quot;almighty bomb&quot;. There's this black dude who can make people kill each other if he shuts his eyes real tight and looks like he's taking a crap.I am not making any of this up.What saves the film at this point is a cameo by none other than Moses himself. The NRA chairman appears towards the end of the movie and he's as surly as ever. His manic performance takes &quot;Beneath&quot; up a notch.But to say the ending is anti-climatic is, well, an understatement.There seems to be no hurry to get the &quot;Planet of the Ape&quot; sequels out on DVD. I am not surprised. Each one gets progressively worse. See &quot;Return to...&quot; if you don't believe me.

169989,"""Seinfield"" has ruined me. So many little things pop up in life that remind me of certain episodes and this movie is one of them. Goofball George joins a book club to read Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's which is a slim volume easily read within a snap, but George, naturally, must cheat and watch the video instead. The movie is quite different from the book, as George discovers to his dismay. I adore both but as entities separate from one another.The movie is a frothy little concoction of romance, kooky characters, and a sparkly clean New York City. A veil of misty eyed yearning and gentle sweetness belie the sordid underbelly of prostitution, organized crime, and other illegal activities but the movie does not dig that deep. It is a fashionable fairytale, after all, and to enjoy the film that is the best way to approach it.Miss Holly Golightly is a charming flit-about who accepts $50 from her gentlemen ""friends"" for the powder room then ditches them. Her new neighbor, whom she calls Fred because he reminds her of her beloved brother, is a jaded dried-up writer kept by an older wealthy woman. Holly also earns money by delivering &quot;weather reports&quot; for a jailed mobster. She is amazingly oblivious to what is really going on but she looks so marvelously fab in sleek black dresses and UFO sized hats that one simply cannot hold it against her.A tender poignancy is what saves this movie. I reached for the tissues over the character's frustrations and desperate longings to escape from lives in which they felt trapped. I also found the confusion of Holly's sweet and simple old hubby tapping on my little ole' heart when he shows up in New York to take his young bride back home where he feels she belongs.I enjoy this movie for what it is and not what it could've been. Still, I gladly could do without the Mickey Rooney character - a slimy and oh so unfunny fake-Japanese photographer - but he is a minor character (why did they bother with him at all?) and thankfully is not seen much.See the movie, read the book, but don't become flabbergasted like George Constanza to discover that one is a moon river serenade while the other is a smoky torch song.",N/A
186586,"Suspiria was made a long time ago, in film terms, anyway. Yet it still seems modern, despite being very stylized. This film is unmistakably European and decidedly scary. The story goes something like this: A naive and innocent American girl gets sent to a deadly, decadent, and wicked European dance school (in Germany, no less); soon all hell breaks loose and our American ballerina is fighting for her life; I agree with another viewer that the heavily synthesized score really under'scored' the stylized horror of the film. You may be wondering about my use of the word style, but once you've seen the film you're sure to agree after seeing just a few minutes of its eerie sets and haunting music. It's like a truly terrifying haunted house at the fair; and those have never frightened me. Or maybe it's because I was really really stoned when I saw this movie. That tends to heighten the excitement.Cheers!",Suspiria VHS
158635,"The greatest sci fi trilogy ever told is finally here and is well worth the money. George Lucas takes you on the fantastic adventure in a galaxy far far away. Fans on this epic trilogy will not be dissapointed with this DVD. It is kind of too bad that Lucas added more special effects and scenes to make it better. There is no need to put the new special effects in it. The special effects of the 70's and 80's movies is what made the films so great. By adding those scenes he is taking all the magic away from the original film. They should release the originals on a new DVD. The special fetures are awsome and will not dissapoint.

807975,"There is going to be a large group of people that aren't going to like this movie for a three main reasons.  One, there aren't any clear protagonists.  Two the characters the movie centers on don't necessarily win.  Three, Tom Cruise stars.The director of this movie is best known for directing the classic Civil War epic Glory.  This movie shows a lot of similar aspects of Glory.Tom Cruise who is a former hero from the Civil War is now broken and destitute.  His past haunts him and he can't seem to find any sort of life outside the millitary.  His character was involved in forcing Native Americans out of lands desired by the American government.  In other words killing any that didn't leave voluntarily.  So he has nightmares of being ordered to kill women and children.  Winchester pays him to do performances telling the values of their rifles, but even they are losing patience with him.  His alcoholism and depression have made him next to impossible to work with.He is then looked up by a man he used to serve with who has a business proposition.  Japan has decided to modernize their society to keep pace with the times.  So they are hiring people from all over the world to help them out.  Most notably ""warriors"" from the United States.He is sent to Japan and starts to teach their ""soldiers"", which are conscripts, main farmers who'd never fired a rifle in their lives.  When their leaders inform him of an opponent the the modernization, a samurai that opposes the new ways.  He is told he needs to take his army into battle, their superior weapons will help ensure victory.  He warns them that it is a bad idea to take green soliders into a battle with combat veterans this early despite their superior weapons.His fears prove justified, the soliders are too frightened to follow orders or even keep rank.  The Samurai rush in and quickly defeat his forces.  He is kept alive because the samurai leader, Katsumoto, is interested in this fierce fighter, and wants to learn of his enemy.  So the Samurai reluctantly let him live and take him into the mountains where he is trapped there by the winter.This was a well acted, well shot, and engaging.  Some people complain that the plot has been done before, but what plots haven't?  The Lion King followed the story of Hamlet, Resevoir Dogs was about 60% of a hong kong movie ""city on fire"", and Kill Bill is a mix of every major hong kong and japanese action cinema in existence.  The important part is how it is carried out.This movie has well choreographed action sequences.  Though they were a little inaccurate towards the end on what was known and what they did, it was a minor detail.The main characters weren't the heroes you would expect them to be.  They humanized so that you relate with them, but are still their own people.  There is a discussion where they talk of Custer's last stand, one that we look at with embarassment.  Katsumoto on the other hand is impressed with their bravery and thinks they died a good death.  Dying in combat against incredible odds was not only brave to him, but honorable.  Didn't matter the reasons, Samurai didn't believe in right or wrong, only duty.Tom Cruise wasn't that bad, he has matured since Risky Business.  He isn't at the level of Sean Connery or George Clooney, but he is competent and believable in this role.  Which interestingly enough is very close to the Union general Grant, an alcoholic that seemed to be only fit for war.  Only Cruise's character was only a low level officer, not a general.All in all this is a well made and entertaining film.  There should be elements for all types, so it would be a good date movie.  Action to keep guys interested, and complicated romantic elements that will entertain the women.  It doesn't reach the same levels as Gladiator or Braveheart, but it is worth the price of admission.  As well as being a treat for those who love asian culture.",N/A

860413,"Since this movies conception, there have been numerous references to Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the 1992 classic Batman Returns. 2004's Catwoman has absolutely nothing to do with either Batman, his villians, nor any resemblence to that Catwoman character. Questions have been raised wondering whether Halle Berry could fill the same role as Pfeiffer. Well, in my opinion, no. The depth of acting it took for this incarnation was more geared to martial arts and being sexy in leather. Don't take it wrong, Halle Berry, an excellent actress, wasn't given any true depth of character to work with.The movie seems to be divided into halves. The first part deals with Patience Philips working for a cosmetic company as an art designer who just can't seem to get anything right when it comes to her boss. What began promising at first, turned into a disaster when Catwoman finally arrived about 40 minutes into the film. This second half lost the story with a barrage of leaps and fights mixed with a loose love story.There are a few resemblences to Batman Returns, and maybe these were a nod to it:1. Halle Berry turns towards the camera, crouched delivering the same Meow! as Pfeiffer's character.2. Catwoman, always letting her curiousity rule, goes into a store, where instead of meeting 2 security guards as Pfeiffer's did, she meets 3 robbers.3. Catwoman stands in front of the moon.4. Catwoman nearly falls out the window, and later on, is almost pushed out the window.The references are there, but for anyone who hasn't seen Batman Returns, you wouldn't notice them. There are a few more nods, but I think the point is delivered.So, what's this story all about? Well, if anyone has seen the trailer to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, then you would have the story in a nutshell. In the trailer to RE2 (due this Fall) there's a facial cream that rots your skin and its side effects are toxic. (Funny, I was reminded as well of The Jokers mixture of poisonous toxins he shipped from his factory to shelves in 1989's Batman.)Ok, we have the fired employee who is killed because she found out about the evil corporations secret. A cat performs CPR (or so that's what it looks like), and she comes back to life. There isn't a comic book villian in this movie, ala Joker, Penguin, or Doc Ock (Spider-Man 2). What we have is the ruthless and completely flat corporate executives. There's no depth to these villians and no clever schemes to nab Catwoman, only pin a few deaths on her. There's your story ladies and gentlemen and I think you can pretty much figure out how it turns out.In the beginning, there was so much promise. From the opening credits showing the origins of cats in myth and legend to the meeting she has with the owner of Midnight (the cat who performed CPR.) After that, it was a downhill spiral. I will say that the catsuit was nice and very revealing, however the headpiece looks really odd. Catwoman got her claws from Tiffany's I think (they really do look like designer nails).I have to say, in all fairness, that Catwoman in Batman Returns was a lot more real and the character had a purpose. From her stitched up suit to her makeshift claws. Some may think I was going into this movie with a preception of Catwoman from Batman, but I did not. I had followed this movie since it was first announced and knew it was not the same. I also knew it had nothing to do with the Dark Knight, but I did expect one thing...a good story for the money. Halle Berry is better than a walkthrough part and deserves a good script, she's proven herself as a fine actress. Nothing is really explained in the movie and it's loosely tied together between action sequences and sex appeal.To see, or not to see, that is the question. The answer is up to you.",N/A

333658,"Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" explores the twilight years of a person's life when an individual cannot help but reflect on his or her past personal triumphs and regrets. It is a time of introspection when one acknowledges the limitations of a mortal existence. It is also an experience that is not easily translatable to film.Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) is about to receive an honorary degree for his fifty years of work as a doctor. On his way to the ceremony, he decides to visit places that had played major roles in his life in his younger days. Accompanied by his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), Borg stops at his family's summer cottage, the town in which he previously worked at as a doctor, and his mother's house. Memories come flooding back at each stop and his reminiscing becomes even more intimate when he picks up a young hitchhiker named Sara (Bibi Andersson) who bears an uncanny resemblance to his first love.If you enjoy abstract films loaded with symbolism then ""Wild Strawberries"" is the film for you. You will have an absolute ball deconstructing the sequence where Borg comes across the clock with no hands. However, if you have trouble warming up to films with unconventional narratives then ""Wild Strawberries"" will be an ordeal to sit through. Sjostrom is absolutely wonderful as the aging doctor but his gem of a performance loses some of its impact because the film is more concerned with giving tangible form to ideas than telling a story. ""Wild Strawberries"" is cinematic surrealism with a vengeance. Bergman wants to translate profound and universal themes into a mass medium but the result is awkward because film cannot truly capture the pure essence behind these themes effectively. The great director should be commended for his ambition in making this film, but the end result is a disorienting viewing experience. ""Wild Strawberries"" ultimately plays more like an experiment than a work of art.",Wild Strawberries VHS

And though historical details are lacking, Armenia's history has been a disruptive one at that, witnessed by the many ruins of churches which dot this ancient pastoral countryside and by the fractured familial relationships that result from endless unrest.  Indeed, the films of the churches in Armenia was filmed on site in 10 days with an escort of soldiers and filmed with home video calibre equipment in 1992 or so.  There are 13 characters in the film, none with names.  The three principal characters are Egoyan and his wife, in real life, Arsinee Khanjian, and the interpreter who comes between them breaking up their marriage, which painfully he must witness while filming, documenting the event forever, at least for the length of the movie.  Love is such an intense emotion, 'stronger than death', which Egoyan's character must grapple with the loss of for an entire year as he turns each page of the calendar remembering the events and conversations at those moments.  Attempting to forget his wife, he entertains 10 ""guests"", girlfriends, at his home in Toronto, yet is somehow constantly reminded of his separation and loss.  It reminded me of Groundhog Day, yet in the end, Egoyan doesn't get the girl like Bill Murray does.  The unidentified foster child of Egoyan in this film, in addition to Egoyan's separation from his wife, is reminiscent of Gabriel Bagradian's family in The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, in that they are split apart as a family.  I gave the movie four stars just because I found the story too emotionally intense for me.  It was very frustrating to see Egoyan suffer as he did, thinking why doesn't he quit tormenting himself, yet there had been a strong bond between he and his wife and through his work.  I think this movie has a lot to say about the power of image in evoking powerful human emotions.  We are very influenced by what we choose to see and hear, yet, in Egoyan's case, it seems he is somehow hostage to this situation; he has no free will to forget his betrayal until the last day of the year and the last phone call from his wife.",Calendar VHS

Who read the Harry Potter books knows that this is the most epic of the books, in my opnion is not the best, Order Of The Phoenix is better, but this is the second!!! We will have a new director, Mike Newell, he says that will bring his on view of Harry Potter, we will have the same cast, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. This may be really long, i think it will be something about 3 hours, it's 700 pages to turn on movie. But i know that will be awesome!!! The Harry Potter films will get even better with this one, after that we will have to wait a little bit to see Harry Potter back on the big screen again, Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix may be released in november 2006 or summer of 2007, i don't think that it will be split in two, i think is difficult that J.K Rowling will allow that, i believe that until 2010 we will have all 7 Harry Potter films done.

840996,"I was really looking forward to seeing 'Shaun of the Dead', and since it never came to any local theaters despite the fact that it was outperforming half the films showing at those places even with a limited release, I got to look forward to seeing it even longer. (um, yay. A fate to which House of Flying Daggers is no doubt consigned)  Fortunately, it proved  to be more than worth the wait, and was definitely  one of the best movies in a fairly ho-hum year.  As far as comedies go, I think this movie's about as good as it gets.  Of course, I'm a big horror fan, and a big zombie fan, in particular, so this is pretty much aimed right at me.  Still, 'Shaun of the Dead' probably has a lot more general appeal than your typical Horror-Comedy, and I think it should appeal to must people who like comedies that, ya know, don't suck.Alright, basic setup.  Shaun is a 29 year old guy, who's kinda aimless and going nowhere, at least partially due to his bestfriend/roomate Ed, who's a fat, immature loser.  So, his girlfriend, Liz, dumps him, and he and Ed get really drunk, and where ever the film was heading before is interrupted, as England is then overrun by zombies.  Unlike the more famous horror-comedy films (Evil Dead II, Re-Animator, Dead-Alive), this film actually takes itself fairly seriously at times. (Particularly towards the end, where the characters are all holed in together, appear to be pretty much doomed, and start fighting one another.)  Some people have gone so far as to say this is more Horror film than Comedy, which is massively overstating it, but it's certainly not purely light-hearted fare either. Lots of people think this is a bad thing, but I certainly don't.  It works very well both when it's trying to be funny and when it's trying to be serious/dramatic/touching, and I always like films that are willing to play with tone.(one of the best aspects of the original Dawn of the Dead, imo)  I also particularly like the  more serious bits, because it makes it abundantly obvious that the makers of the film have a genuine affection for the genre they're parodying.The film has a level a visual flair and an attention to detail which are pretty extraordinary for a comedy, and quite impressive, regardless of genre.  They use lots of great long, steadicam shots and some fun, ultra-kinetic, rapid fire editing. (used to comedic, rather than dramatic effect)  The detail comes in how there's lots going on in the background, and how the film likes to repeat similar scenarios, before and after the zombie attack, and of course, the numerous references to other films.  They're particularly fond of referencing the original Living Dead trilogy, naturally, with a particular penchant for the Evil Dead films as well.  Still, it doesn't rely on Horror films alone, referencing The Deer Hunter and Reservoir Dogs, and British tv shows, and probably lots of other stuff I didn't catch.  I also like how it has the will to be subtle- you probably won't notice the references if you aren't familiar with the original material. (i.e. there aren't any moments in the film where it's abundantly obvious that what someone did/said was a reference so something, but you don't know what it is.  At least there weren't for me)Reviewing comedies is hard.  All I can say is that I though it was funny. Very funny.  It smarter than your average comedy, I suppose, but it isn't afraid of slapstick or lowbrow humor either. Going into specifics would be pretty fruitless, and hurt the film when you actually see it, so I won't bother. You'll just have to trust me on this one.It's also got a surprising amount of gore, which is generally nicely done. There are quite a few nicely done gunshots, and two particularly stunning headshots. Furthermore, this film doesn't ever let us forget that zombies eat flesh, and there's scene of someone being ripped limb from limb which recalls a number of deaths from Dawn and Day of the Dead simultaneously.  The zombies themselves look quite nice, though they are fairly low-key.Yeah, that's about it.  Definitely a great movie, which certainly must be viewed by any zombie fan.",Shaun of the Dead

774426,"It is always interesting to get a slice of indigenous life, and Whale Rider offers a compelling look into Maori culture in New Zealand.  Keisha Castle-Hughes stands out as Pai, a teenage girl determined to take part in the coming-of-age rituals which she feels is her birth right.  The only problem is that she is a girl and has to get past her rigid Grandfather in order to do so.The movie tries to balance modern-day realities against age-old customs, while offering an optimistic view of Maori life. It builds slowly to its dramatic end. Pai is dealt a cruel blow when her grandfather refuses to train her in the ancient rituals.  Her grandfather is the spiritual leader of the village and hasn't been able to overcome the fact that neither of his sons have been able to give him a grandson.  She had chosen to stay in the village rather than go off to Europe with her father.  Pai's grandmother offers some solace, but ultimately Pai has to take matters into her own hands when a pod of whales is left stranded on the beach.  She had learned the rituals from her uncle, who sees in Pai what her grandfather is unable to.  Pai has a natural calling for whales and feels it was her fault that the whales beached themselves.The scenes are evocatively handled and one sees much of the beauty in Maori culture with very little of the harsh realities.  Niki Caro gives the movie the feeling of a parable, which should play well with young audiences.",Whale Rider
538811,"This is a remarkable film about an exceptional story based on an eventful life. I'm surprised by the number of critics. Does this film try and glorify the drug dealer? No. Is George Jung a hero? No. Is the film's purpose to make him one? No. This is why I have problems with a majority of the critics of this excellent film. Why the criticism? The subject matter? The fact that it was based on a true story?At any rate, back to the film, which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film is told from a narrative perspective by George Jung (Johnny Depp) tracing the spectacular rise and fall of the pioneering US cocaine distributor of the 1970's / 80's.The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly.The audience takes an incredible journey, pulled into a world of drug smuggling / distributing, the illusion of 'easy money', ensuing greed and finally betrayal. While many are quick to point out the fact that this person was a &quot;drug dealer&quot; and ponder, &quot;why feel sorry for him?&quot;, this misses the point. His story doesn't search for sympathy from the audience, although it is a sad one. It is an unapologetic look at an unapologetic life.The greatest takeaway from his experience was that he realized too late what was truly important in his life. Simple things, not the money, not the cars, but &quot;real&quot; things as foreshadowed by his father's speech to him as a child. A point that is continually being underscored by his father's unconditional love (wonderfully played by Ray Liotta, a refreshing character change for him) and culminates in his own unconditional love for his daughter - although he is too late to recieve it.",N/A

601197,"'Deliever Us From Eva' was a suprise hit, to say the least. I didn't watch it in theaters, nor did I rent it. It came on Cinemax last night and I found myself drawn into it. It suprised me that it didn't fall on it face. But suprise, LL Cool J (whom I can't really stand as an actor, nor a singer) didn't ruin the film and it turned out to be a success. The success of the film lies in Gabrielle Union (who plays Eva.) Her character plays a head strong liberal female who is a constant pain. She teaches everything she learns to her three sisters, who in turn, use all the advice on their men. After a while the three men finally find a way to get rid of Eva...set her up with a local player, (LL Cool J) Ray -- for the price of $5,000. Ray takes the challenge and soon after him and Eva are getting to know each other a little too well, and the three men can't stand the fact that Eva and Ray fall in love and both are giving her sister's advice, defeating the purpose of Ray and leading to the inevitable showdown. This film was a big suprise, it has both heart and laughter, a DVD that I will surely pick up very soon!

317350,"This one is possibly the last really good Bond movies?It see's the demise of Bond's old enemy Blofeld, who had become quite a fixture in the series. The incredible theme song by Sheena Easton is a credit to the movie.Bond is once again called on to solve the mystery of the destruction of a British ship and its crew.He is brought together with a sultry Greek beauty Melina Havalok (Carole Bouquet), who is out to revenge the brutal murder of her parents. They are brought up against drug cartels with links to the Soviet Bloc. Melina's first act is to take out - with her crossbow- the vicious Cuban assassin who dispatched her parents, before trying to find out who was behind this all. It is Bond who needs to get her to slow down, with promises that justice will be done.At least most of us knew then who the villains of the world where then - and these included Castro's tyrannical regime in Cuba. This was before so many people where brainwashed by Noam `Wormtongue' Chomsky and his ilk, to regard tyrants and terrorists as heroes and those who fight them as villainsAnd Bond's run-in with the villains brings him up against various East bloc thugs.Bond has to find out who the real drug lord and killer, who is working hand in glove with the Soviets and Cubans, and it is not who he initially though it was. Lots of thrilling action.I adored Bibi Dahl, the adorable young skater played by the lovely blond Lynn Holly-Johnson. Bibi is just cute, with a smile to remember forever, even if she is a bit overeager to get into Bond's bed.",Bond: For Your Eyes Only VHS
628884,"In a nutshell, this is a very worthy rental even if it doesn't quite live up to the odes hailed by critics. In fact the general tempo of Garden State is reminiscent of a recent film with similar idiosynchratic tones, The Station Agent.But director/writer/actor Braff's ability to underplay his befuddled stance in the midst of wacky comedy without appearing silly himself, is quite impressive. His sublime sensibility permeates the entire film as our protagonist visits his mother's house after a patch of nine years to attend her funeral, in the process reuniting with his old high school buddies as well as his family.The characters are interestingly quirky, some less hokey than others, but I couldn't help leaving with an intense personal disdain for Natalie Portman and her incredulous antics.The humour is endearing and generally clever, plus we get a certain ""detour"" that turns out to be thematically quite relevant. Much of the film's fizz wears out by the tail end though.A word for the soundtrack: it is stellar, throwing into the fray some cool chill-out inputs from Zero 7 and Coldplay. I recommend it more than the film itself, get a copy if you like your music relaxed and downtempo.Overall, Garden State is a likeable little charmer with incidental pleasures, but it's not quite the cinematic Eden that critics promised. Recommended rental.",Garden State
202573,"Psycho II is a good follow-up to the Hitchock classic. It's not a masterpiece by any means, like its 1960 predecessor, but it does a decent job of re-introducing audiences to Norman Bates for a bloodier, more violent film that delivers decent suspense. A terrific cast, which includes pre-fame Dennis Franz (NYPD Blue) and the wonderful Meg Tilly, as well as the return of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Vera Miles as Lila, add to the fun. Wish Janet Leigh had somehow made a cameo.This is the plot in a nutshell: Norman Bates has been locked away in a mental institution for over 20 years, but is finally released. Lila Loomis, Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) sister, protests his release, but her arguments fall on deaf ears. Now Bates is back in town and trying to do right by working in a small diner. Soon he starts to see his long-deceased mother in the Bates Motel window and brutal murders start once again. Could it be Bates or is someone else feeding their deviant need to kill?Psycho II starts off with the famous shower scene from the original Psycho and holds interest. The film could have resorted to the cheap slasher techniques of the day, but instead it concentrates on developing the character of Norman Bates--a sympathetic soul who is fighting to overcome his past and live as a normal person. Norman is a victim of crazed people who insist on persecuting him and, as a result, seems incredibly sane by comparison. Unfortunately the end to Psycho II contradicts this development, turning Norman into a leering loon in preparation for another sequel.It would impossible for Psycho II to live up to the original, but the cast and crew give it their best shot. The film is actually pretty competent throughout, though the silly finale ruins what is otherwise an interesting and suspenseful (if totally unnecessary) sequel. Overall, this is a decent sequel with a great cast, and worth seeing for fans of the original, who may or may not like it. Either way, it's good to see and compare.",N/A

253994,"In his foreword to Bantam's ""Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Novels and Stories,"" Loren Estleman called the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson literature's warmest, most symbiotic and most timeless ever: rightfully so.  Not surprisingly, film history is littered with adaptations of Conan Doyle's tales and Holmes pastiches (stories using the protagonists but otherwise based on independent screenplays); and I don't think any of Conan Doyle's four original novels has been adapted more frequently than ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""  Yet - and I'm saying this with particular apologies to the fans of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce canon - none of the prior versions of any Holmes story can hold a candle to the ITV/Granada TV series produced over the decade spanning the years 1984 through 1994, starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and first David Burke, then in near-seamless transition Edward Hardwicke as a refreshingly sturdy, pragmatic and unbumbling Dr. Watson; and this certainly includes any and all adaptations of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""Thus, this version of Conan Doyle's spookiest tale stands out positively not only when compared to some of the other movie adaptations starring Jeremy Brett, which tend to over-emphasize a gothic atmosphere not present in the stories *those* movies are based on (particularly so, ""The Last Vampyre"" and ""The Eligible Bachelor""), but also when compared to earlier versions of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""  Indeed, stripped of those other productions' antics and occasionally not much better than B-movie-level special effects, the Jeremy Brett/Edward Hardwicke adaptation relies primarily on the superb acting skills of its stars and supporting cast and tells the story of the Baskerville family's apparent curse in a relatively straightforward manner, which truly manages to terrify where earlier versions were merely unintentionally funny. Largely true to Conan Doyle's original, this is also the only one of the movie-length adaptations that sees Dr. Watson performing an investigation of his own. (He embarks on similar, albeit generally less elaborate missions, in some of the series's shorter episodes, such as ""The Solitary Cyclist."")The tale's storyline itself is well known:  Sir Charles Baskerville has been found dead, apparently killed by a mysterious, larger-than-life dog living in the moors surrounding his estate and occasionally heard howling at night; allegedly a hound from hell haunting the family since the days of their evil ancestor Sir Hugo Baskerville.  When Sir Henry  (Kristoffer Tabori), latest heir to the Baskerville title and fortune, arrives from the U.S., Holmes is hired to investigate the mystery surrounding the beast.  And ""[y]es, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men ...,"" Holmes soon comments on the setting of the Baskerville estate.  But asked by Dr. Watson whether he is inclined to place any belief into the supernatural explanation of the phenomenon, he proceeds to point out that the devil's agents may well be of flesh and blood, and that the only questions to be resolved in the matter are whether any crime has been committed at all, and if so, what that crime is and how it was committed.  As (nearly) always, Holmes is of course proven right in the end.Jeremy Brett was the only actor who ever managed to perfectly portray Sherlock Holmes's imperiousness, bitingly ironic sense of humor and apparently indestructible self-control without at the same time neglecting his genuine friendship towards Dr. Watson and the weaknesses hidden below a surface seemingly dominated by his overarching intellectual powers. And that dichotomy is clearly in evidence in this movie, where Brett, himself already afflicted by the illness which would eventually kill him, reaches new, intense and particularly great depths in Holmes's soul.  If you want to see the best of Holmes, therefore get this production, the equally well-done Jeremy Brett adaptation of ""The Sign of the Four"" and the collections of the series's shorter episodes (particularly the first two cycles - ""Adventures"" and ""Return"" - are a ""must""), enjoy and ... have a good hunt, because - come on Watson: the game's afoot!Also recommended:The Complete Sherlock Holmes: All 4 Novels and 56 Short StoriesSherlock Holmes: The Complete Granada Television Series (12 DVD)Sherlock Holmes: A Baker Street DozenSherlock Holmes of Baker StreetBending the Willow: Jeremy Brett As Sherlock HolmesDr. Bell and Mr. Doyle - The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock HolmesMurder Rooms - The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock HolmesThe Life of Sir Arthur Conan DoyleConan Doyle, Detective: The True Crimes Investigated by the Creator of Sherlock HolmesArthur and George",The Return of Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles VHS
510135,"This certainly isn't one of Dario's classics, but the presence of Dario's daughter Asia in the central role, certainly raises the quality and interest of the film.  She is a solid actor and good fun to watch on screen.  Admittedly the plot is somewhat loose in parts, but this is typical of the Dario Argento style, and this movie certainly has the hallmarks of one of his films.  There is a fair degree of blood and guts but nothing too torturous to get worked up about.  I'd say it's about on par with most of his other efforts in this regard and perhaps a little less confronting.  As others have mentioned the quality of the film on this DVD is quite poor.  It looks very much like it was filmed on video rather than real film.  The colours are washed out and the image is grainy rather than sharp.  This is somewhat of an Achilles heel because Dario's movies draw much of their power from their vivid often somewhat surrealistic imagery.  When you are watching a diminished copy like this, you just don't notice the cinematography.  Hopefully, as others have said, a better copy is still to be released.",N/A
818859,"Based on the manga from Maki Murakami, this series was only available in fansub (japanese dialect with captions) up until now. One of the most popular shonen-ai (boy love) series of its time, and it's easy to see why.First of all, the art. It's simply beautiful. The characters' expressions and movements are masterfully portrayed while still remaining true to Murakami's original style.Secondly, the storyline. Shuichi Shindo wants to be a rock star. With the help of his best friend and guitarist, Hiroshi Nakano, he is able to put together his own band, Bad Luck. One day, while walking in the park, he happens to come across a foreign-looking man who criticizes him bluntly about his poor skills as a lyrics writer. This bothers Shuichi for a long time, and finally he is able to meet this man again. Soon, Shu begins to learn more about him, including his name and profession. He also discovers that he has become obsessed with this man in a way that he cannot understand. He thinks it is love. Could it be Gravitation?Third, the voices. In a lot of cases with anime, the english version isn't quite as good compared to the japanese voices. It would be easy to make that same claim with this series-- after all, the japanese version had voices from well-proven actors such as Tomokazu Seki (Shuichi Shindo in Gravi, Kamui Shirou in X), Kappei Yamaguchi (Ryuichi Sakuma in Gravi, Subaru Sumeragi in Tokyo Babylon), and Koyasu Takehito (Sakano in Gravi, Hotohori in Fushigi Yugi). However, I think that the english actors did an awesome job on the characters here.Last of all, the music. This aspect, perhaps, is by far the best part of the whole series. If you have listened to the Gravitation TV soundtrack (also found here at Amazon) or the Shuichi Shindo Vocal Collection (try Anime Castle), then you will know what I mean. When I first heard that this series was about a boy trying to become a rock star, I envisioned music that was hurriedly made, with repeated rhythms and melodies. Wrong. Each song in Gravitation is unique, and the beginning and ending themes (Super Drive and Glaring Dream-- they're included in the TV soundtrack) are the best anime beginning and ending themes that I've ever heard.",N/A

Someone has killed Marvin Acme, owner of ToonTown and Roger takes the heat for it. Of course he was framed but by who and why? Roger seeks the help of Eddie Valiant, a once prominant detective that fell into hard times after his brother was killed by a toon. Thus was his reluctance to help Roger since he was a toon. But he does help Roger, and he must get to the bottom of the mystery before Judge Doom finds and kills Roger by &quot;dipping him&quot;. Eddie feels sorry for the rabbit so he investigates before it is too late, and along the way he discovers more and more about why Acme was killed and that ToonTown itself is in danger. Oh yeah, and Roger was the perfect one to frame because his wife Jessica Rabbit had been seen meeting with Acme before he died. So most people probably know the plot already, but if not it is highly original and entertaining.This masterpiece couldn't get any better treatment than this, a fully loaded 2 disc set sporting both a family-friendly version on disc 1 and enthusiast version on disc 2. There are so many extras that it will take you a long time to see everything. I admittedly have just begun to see the treasures contained within. But it is obvious that the utmost care was taken to give this the fair dvd treatment it deserved--mission accomplished. This is probably my third favorite movie of all-time, and is without a doubt the best mix of live action and animation. So many great characters appear in this movie such as Bugs and Daffy in the scene where Eddie is falling  and they hand him an anvil instead of a 'chute. It is sheer movie magic, and something I could watch all the time and never get tired of seeing it. Director Zimeckis has done a remarkable job with this film, and we also great great performances from Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (Judge doom) and pretty much everyone else appearing in the film with the addition of the voices of Roger and Jessica who were terrific. To me this is a perfect movie so if you havent seen it before rent it, and if you like it then buy it. If you are a fan then you must own this dvd. It is truly a great thing and this dvd set presents it in all of its glory, the way it should be done.",N/A

I am a huge fan of Spike and would rather him go souless and retain his character's great, quirkey and sexy personality.  Besides, Buffy never knew she had it so good with Spike.  Who needs Angel.

775653,"When I first heard that HOW TO DEAL was a combination of two of Sarah Dessen's books, I was skeptical. I love Dessen's books, and thought that making a movie out of one of the books would be a disaster, let alone combining two. Boy was I wrong! HOW TO DEAL is a great teen movie.Halley isn't sure what to believe...her life is incredibly messed up at the moment, and everthing keeps getting crazier. The day her parent's divorce comes through, her sister announces her engagement. Of course Halley doesn't like her future brother-in-law, and she runs to her best friend Scarlett for help. Except, Scarlett doesn't have the same opinion about love. She's fallen head over heels for Michael, a cute, athletic boy. In fact, Halley meets him when she walks in on him and Scarlett...professing their love for eachother.Of course, tragedy strikes soon, and - once again - Halley's life has taken another turn. She meets Macon, token bad boy, and they start hanging out...Scarlett doesn't know what to think when she finds out that she's pregnant, Halley's mom thinks all men are horrible, Halley's dad's getting remarried to &quot;The Bimbo,&quot; and Halley's sister is about to get married.HOW TO DEAL is such a cute teen movie, I can't say enough to justify the movie. It's not realistic, it's predictable, it's cheesy - but somehow it's still fun. HOW TO DEAL is recommended to any teenage girls that loved movies like 10 Things I Hate About You, A Walk to Remember, and Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.Overall grade - A",N/A
787460,"I don't think Camp was half as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be.  The cast is made of aspiring actors playing aspiring actors.....what could be more appropriate?  Granted their acting skills aren't polished.  But they are portraying actors in musical theater.....their voices are what matters.  And I have to say everyone in the film had fantastic singing voices.  I am glad Camp wasn't cast with young pop stars turned actors (Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, the Olsen Twins, Bow Wow). This cast, imperfections and all, was truer to the form.Even if you don't appreciate musical theater, the theme of kids growing up and trying to find their place in the world is a key part of this movie.What I appreciate most about Camp is how it portrays teens as having aspirations and goals in life.  It's not one of those teen-exploitation films where teenagers are portrayed as being pot smoking, sex-obsessed, and souless (i.e. American Pie).  We need more films that challenge teens, without being ridiculousely wholesome.  Camp has achieved that.",Camp
511140,"Ok so there's no nudity or gore, but this film has quite a few scenes that will send some chills up your spine. The little girl that plays the ghost of Mellisa is evil, scary, and a diabolical little killer. Check her out in the scene where she wills the innkeeper's daughter to stab herself through the throat. I mean really look at her! That smile is pure evil and the way she keeps darting her eyes is sinister. When she pops out of closets or in hallways she always has that evil twisted little look and she raised the level of how the film turned out. Kudos to the director for getting that girl to do that.Of course there are some hot chicks in this movie as well. The innkeeper's daughter is a real cutie. Monica plays Melissa's older sister and she is stunning. Check out the scene when she wakes up from her nightmare. She gives us a heartbreaking view of her thighs. That demented doll sitting on the edge of the bed was another fright thrown in for good measure. ANd how can we forget the lovely raven haired sorceress? She's a hottie.Our hero is the good doctor who came to the village to investigate an apparant suicide, but the townsfolk know it's really the curse of Melissa. Check out this dudes hair. In the entire movie never a hair is out of place. It's like his whole head was dipped in clear plastic. I mean sure he never changes his clothes either, but my God that hair. How could he investigate a murder with all the time he would need to spend in front of the mirror? I guess that's why the Burgermeister was bald, we had enough hair to deal with.Anyway, this movie is great. Sure they go a little heavy on the fog machine, and all the corpses are breathing and have eyes moving under the lids, but aside from that this is a fine picture. Even the old hag who played Mellisa's mother played a fine role.So when you see a girl being trampled, you better help. Or else this could happen to you.",Kill Baby Kill
617946,"I personally think Vol 2 is better, but this one certainly is not bad at all.  This one is a stylish action packed revenge story, with good performances and is lots of fun.  The second one is more of a character driven drama, with 2 cool fights, and a brief but still well choreographed fight between Bill and the bride.  Also i must say that apart the movies are great, but if they were put together, which they will be soon, they would be 10 times greater.  I a waiting for the merged dvd because i would prefer watchin the whole bloody affair all at once, hint hint, (thats what the combined version is going to be called).  I give this movie a 9 out of a 10, i thought the reference to pimping out the bride while she is in her coma was kind of stupid, but everything else kicks a$$, esspecially the gogo fight.",N/A
347293,"Put on your pjs, make the popcorn, and settle back for one superb chick-flick!  Ingrid Bergman stars as a  sophisticated Parisian who has had an &quot;understanding&quot; with Yves Montand for five years.  The understanding is she's madly in love with and faithful to him; he's free to date other women and see her when it's convenient.  Enter Anthony Perkins as a rich, spoiled young man who falls head over heels for Ingrid.  She's flattered, but she's forty; should she stop waiting for Yves and start a relationship with this twenty-five year old?This film whisks you away to another time in the movies, when ladies always wore gloves, men always wore suits or tuxedos, and everyone smoked (glamorously).  It's hard to take your eyes off Ingrid Bergman.  She is stunningly beautiful and a consummate actress.  Your eyes, however, will most definitely be drawn to the gorgeous Mr. Montand, who plays the amorous cad with such aplomb.  Anthony Perkins' character is a needy, immature, almost creepy stalker.  It's an unusual performance.  The film is based on Franoise Sagan's Aimez-vous Brahms? and the rich and romantic sounds of Brahms' Symphony No. 3 in F add to the drama.I heartily recommend Goodbye Again to those who enjoy films with romance, heartbreak, and beautiful music.",N/A
774585,"(Warning: Spoilers ahead)Why oh why did I go see this movie? I remember seeing the first Tomb Raider movie, and it was one of the most boring action films I had ever seen. Perhaps I was drunk (or under some sort of influence) at the time. Whatever the case, I went to see The Cradle of Life, and came out ready to go to sleep.In Lara Croft's latest adventure, she tries to stop an arms manufacturer named Reiss from getting to Pandora's Box, which has the power to kill millions of people. To help her she enlists the aid of convict Terry Sheridan, and together they travel all the way from Hong Kong to Africa in search of Pandora's Box.One of my gripes with this movie is that we seem to get too many pointless shots, which I am sure is supposed to wow us, but instead had my eyes rolling away from the screen due to lack of interest. For instance, one scene has Lara and Terry jumping off of a tall building in flying suits to escape some bad guys. It was cool for a very, very short time, but for some reason the camera kept focusing on them flying for what seemed like forever (okay that might be a bit of an exaggeration). It made me want to yell out ""I get the point! They're flying! Big deal!!!"" There was also another scene in which Lara parachutes into a moving jeep that was picking her up. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think it would be easier (and more logical) for the jeep's driver to stop, wait for her to land, then pick her up, but hey what do I know.There is no doubt that Angelina Jolie looks great as Lara Croft in her many skin tight and revealing outfits. However, she often times seems to have no personality, as her facial expression does not change all that often. Also, we get no real insight into the character of Lara Croft herself, and what really makes her tick, but admittedly I don't think that there's much depth to Croft's character in the first place. The sad thing is that I know that Ms. Jolie can act, but it doesn't show in this movie. Is it the director's fault? The writers' fault? Who knows?This movie also tries to work in some sort of relationship between Lara and Terry. But, as with much of this movie, it falls under the category of pointless plot device. The characters don't have any real motivation or need to be together, and in the end the ""affection"" between them seems way too forced and unnecessary.One of the oddest things I noticed when watching this movie was that I did not get excited during the movie's action scenes. I would even say that some of these scenes (like the fight near the movie's start) were actually slow. Some people might attribute this feeling to me being spoiled by movies like the Matrix, but I very much doubt that considering I have seen many post-Matrix action movies that had cool action scenes (i.e. X-men 2, Terminator 3, and The Hulk).So is there anything about The Cradle of Life that's any good. Well...there was this one scene in Africa where Lara was attacked by these weird monsters. That scene actually held my attention for some time. Also, as mentioned before, Angelina Jolie just looks great in this movie.In conclusion, if for some reason you enjoyed the first Tomb Raider movie, than you will most likely enjoy this one. To everyone else who did not, there are better movies out there to spend your money on.",N/A
88690,"For some reason every time I buy a copy of this movie for my DVD collection and bring it home strange things have happened and at first I thought it was coincidence but after going through four copies, and moving 3 times I've realized this movie comes with a price of peace. Although this film starts off like a drama, at one point it takes a drastic turn. It draws you into the life of this family and the story of this young  girl, who gets posessed by a demon who claims to be the devil himself. The great thing about the Exorcist is that it was made way before it's time....so it isn't taken very seriously as a horror film but think about it this movie lead the way for classics like Night of the Demons and many others. Indeed an innocent young girl posessed is a scary thought, but the make up used throughout each of Blair's transformations from cute girl to hideous demon were remarkably realistic, not to mention the voice(s) that came out of her. This is an absolute classic one to watch at least 3 times a year. I don't recommend it for children but hey I was like 10 years old when I saw it and it didn't bother me!",N/A
572570,"A strangely beautiful film which works its magic on the viewer from the opening credits of first a black bird, then a sole black  African child filling the screen. I was especially taken by the cinematography itself and the use of colour. The mis en scene is almost always a dun or sand or pale brown pastel colour  but pierced by small brilliant colours found in such things as a cummerbund, or pocket kerchief, or the singlet of the protagonist or his odd red sock, a green bottle of absinthe in an outside bar, a green light shade at night, or a crimson hat band on soldiers. Added to this is the startlingly effective use of music , a collage of sounds which modify the images rather than compound or complement them providing a tone of tragi-comedy, a kind of comedy noir.  There is also a memorable nightmare sequence which the protagonist experiences.  As for themes - perhaps that of the scandalous Colonial in another's country, the stranger in a strange land, the decline of the West-or an ageing Colonial Police Chief searching for the meaning of his life and exacting punishment on those who deserve it, on those that he is able to. The closing moments are quite memorable.  Isabelle Huppert reminds one of her rich chameleon talents and is quite brilliant.  A marvellous cinematic experience.",N/A

256533,"""A large market exists in the U.S. for classic movies on DVD. There can really be no excuse for withholding America's rightful cinematic history when Europe and Asia is already enjoying it!"" That comes from another reviewer on these pages, and I second that emotion.I'll go even further than that review and say that Desk Set is the BEST film with Spence and Kate. And don't forget the great Gig Young doing his perfect second banana routine, which has already delighted us in so many other films. They didn't hide behind so many physical gags or the safer facade of black and white. Instead they acted out the script in glorious full color widescreen and stereo, no less.And did Fox drop the ball in giving us the proper widescreen version of this classic? No, they did not! The studio came through for us (which is more than we can usually say about studios) and put it out in widescreen! And they even added some actress commentary for good measure. Yes, it's been a long 9-year wait, since DVDs first came out in 1995, but it's here now, at least.And what a great modern plot Desk Set has: an independent woman (instead of a cloying playtoy), a job for that woman as a research expert, (instead of the usual secretary trying to date her boss), a strong leading man but one with a sense of humor (instead of the usual he-man tough guy). And all smack in the middle of the early revolution of COMPUTERS!The man vs. machine concepts in this film will reverberate down through the ages. Plus it has a great romantic plot, too.

489403,"Whatever the hell it is the Who play, it isn't rock. It's not. The musical tapestry spanned in Townshend's song writing is far too broad and varied to pigeonhole it with a genre label. His father played the music of his time. Townshend himself fell in love with the R&amp;B singles that made their way to Britain from America. His mentor, Kit Lambert loved pop but also carried the influence of his father, Constant Lambert, a composer who worked in film and theatre. Lambert also loved the Baroque and Classical styles, all of which he passed on to Townshend. Townshend has his own ideas. All of it shows. This is not music of any one genre-it's a genre unto itself. But, when the Who plays it, it becomes rock.When they play it on stage it becomes the greatest and most powerful rock music imaginable.It was no surprise (not to Who fans anyway) that their DVD release from the fall 2000 show at the Royal Albert Hall was one of the most celebrated concert videos from that year. The band was firing on all cylinders on the 2000 tour and played at a level closer to what they achieved during their glory years than they'd ever managed since Keith Moon died. That alone was enough to put then back at the forefront.The &quot;Kids are Alright&quot; shows what it was like in the first place.It was the oddest of musical relationships. With the exception of the friendship between Moon and Entwistle none of them really liked each other, at least not in the early days anyway. Townshend's temper was enough to keep anyone away and everyone hated Roger. It reached a head in 1965 when they tossed Roger out for beating up Moon only to realize (to a man) that they were throwing away something that might go beyond anything any of them could imagine. It was their Waterloo and it happened before any of them passed twenty-one.It produced greatness.The Who had what it took to go places, always; everyone in the fold knew that. When they made that commitment they took it beyond what anyone could have dreamt. Throughout their (active recording) career they never followed a formula,  never stopped pushing musical boundaries, and, in concert, always tried to do better than &quot;last night&quot;. They became the most astonishing rock band ever to step on the stage.This film concentrates on showing that.It doesn't preach. There's no narration going through historic details. There's not even a chronological order to the piece. All it does is try to show the Who, and the ingredients that formed their magic to the world. The live footage is electrifying. The interviews are illuminating and hilarious. How could anyone (or anything) contain Keith Moon? How could an interviewer ever hope to step into the middle of the way the core group constantly challenged each other? They couldn't. This was four strong personalities merged into something larger than life. Their relationship wasn't harmonious but an outsider stepping into it found found themselves confronted with, the whole. When they stepped onstage that &quot;whole&quot; was what audiences got. Jeff Stein has been criticized for just &quot;putting what was around&quot; together. That's crap. Jeff Stein is a brilliant film maker who had the sense to let his subjects speak for themselves. That shows all the way through the film. You get the music, a sense of who the band are and a great sample of why their performances are the stuff of legend.How much more is needed? Get it.",N/A
622501,"Ugly and uncomfortable to watch, &quot;Monster&quot; is the first true crime movie since &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; to leave me feeling utterly broken inside.  Aileen Wuornos was a sad and pathetic creature whose past made her into what she became and Charlize Theron brings every complex dimension of her completely to life again in this film.  It wasn't just the makeup and added pounds that made Theron into Wuornos but her uncannily accurate portrayal of the woman who was lost between the horror of her personal life and the dreams she had to be somebody more than her circumstances dictated. Theron almost seems to be inhabited by the soul of Aileen Wuornos with every word, body movement and tormented and crazed wide-eyed look.  Her performance certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for this role and possibly of the decade. The music by BT adds another suitably eerie dimension to the film but it is really Theron's performance of the wonderful screenplay that makes this a 5-star film.There's really not any gore to speak of, but the raw and bottom-line truth of Wuornos' life is what makes the story nearly unpalatable. Guaranteed, this movie will sicken, frighten, sadden and make you squirm.  If it doesn't, you should check to see if you still have a pulse.

552538,"Organized in observance of the tenth anniversary of the death of Karajan, this concert of Mozart's Requiem in the cathedral of Salzburg is performed by the Berliner Philharmonik and Swedish Radio Choir conducted by Claudio Abbado. I found it a profound disappointment.Abaddo drives the ensemble far too fast, and the result is a deliriously-paced performance lacking in any sense of sanctity or gravitas. My favourite performance of the Requiem is that by Das Neue Orchester and Chorus Musicus Koeln under Christoph Spering, and while I understand that not all conductors are willing to keep the work as slowly paced as Spering, there's no excuse for the rushed handling of Abbado.The concert is rounded out with two arias, ""Betrachte dies mien Herz un Frage Mich"" and ""Laudate Dominum"" performed by Rachel Harnisch. While pretty, they add little to the DVD.The visuals of the DVD are mixed. The cathedral is a wonderful work of architecture, and the camera is often placed on its superb art. However, the shots of the orchestra and choir are not so pleasant. One of the choir members has ridiculous waxed moustaches that Salvador Dali could only envy, while some of the female performers are inappropriately dressed for a church. While the important thing is, of course, the music, the poor visuals of the DVD only spoil any enjoyment of the sound.All in all, I would not recommend this DVD. The Requiem is, of course, a wonderful piece of music, but there are better performances out there. Try the aforementioned disc conducted by Spering.",N/A
664075,"Welcome to the year 2000. Alot of things have changed since 1966.Just as you wouldn't compare an encyclopedia to the internet, there's no sense comparing the Grinch cartoon to Grinch the movie.Fortunately the original feature is still with us and still enjoyed by children every holiday season. Now, however, they have a version for their generation as well.Kids today live in the world of high tech flash and kid TV stations that blare dumb jokes and comercials 24 hours a day.They play extreme sports, have their own fashions and vacation in Disneyworld.  Movies need to be in touch with their audience and this one is.Some people complain that it's ""too loud"" and garish - they cringe at the nasty jokes ( which are funny enough to be forgiven and - compared to the really vapid trash in so many movies today -  are nothing ) and bemoan the dark edge of some of the scenes. Alas, not everything can be all things to all people - - -unless they are kids.Ask an eight year old to give you his oppinion and he'll probably tell you that it was funny and cool and sometimes scary.It doesn't get much better than that.The Grinch also gives us something else - a benchmark performance. I always suspected Jim Carey had uncommon talent but his scripts up till this one were dreadful. His portrayal of the Grinch belongs in the company of Karloff's Frankenstein, Lugosi's Dracula, Betty Davis in All About Eve as  a quintessential pairing of actor and role.Ron Howard's direction must have been good because I didn't notice it. I got the feeling you were watching people having fun while working. It flows well and the characters instead of the camera propell the film. A nice touch, perhaps the directors, is the last long pull out from the banquet hall in Whoville to an arial view to a cosmic view that reveals itself to be in actuality an extreme close up of a single slowflake drifting with it's million brothers on route to a fleeting existance before melting.  I think that puts the themes of greed, revenge, rage and our time together nicely in perspective.The Flintstones are a beloved classic too but the movie version had no merit.

12708,"WILD THINGS is the epitome of the good looking contemporary thriller: all of the actors are in top form; the men are handsome; the ladies are ravenous; the story has more twists and turns than a Grisham novel; and the story setting fuses so effortlessly with the tale that it becomes another added element of mystery.I had the good fortune of seeing WILD when it had its theatrical run, and, at that time, I wondered about the prospect of some unused footage.  This thriller continued to re-invent itself -- even through the closing credits -- so I imagined that there were some elements that the director left on the cutting room floor so as not to bombard the viewer with information overload.  Most of what's been restored here is passable: Kevin Bacon's character is fleshed out a bit more, but he ends up appearing more of a conspirator a bit too early in this version as opposed to the original.However, the stunning Denise Richards, Neve Campbell, and (yes) Theresa Russell make this picture definitely worth exploring on subsequent viewings because they do represent three complex personalities: (1) the woman who can have it all and takes it; (2) the woman who wants it all and takes it; and (3) the woman who is deprived of it all but finds a way to take it anyway.Also, think what you will of the talents of Bill Murray, but his short work here coupled with his star-power performances in GROUNDHOG DAY and LOST IN TRANSLATION truly show this man is in peak form when the script requires it.Rediscover this guilty pleasure in its unrated form!",N/A
423056,"The Cowboys is a good but not great Duke western that benefits from good performances by the cast.  Because all the men in town are off in search of gold, rancher Wil Andersen is forced to hire 11 schoolboys to help him drive a herd of cattle to Montana.  Obvious problems arise on the trail as Andersen and his cook, Jebediah Nightlinger, try to help the boys learn how to be cowboys.  Andersen, Nightlinger, and the 11 cowboys also must deal with a band of rustlers threatening to steal their cattle herd.  The plot for this movie is nothing special, but it is still a very enjoyable movie.  John Wayne and Roscoe Lee Browne are very good as are the kids.  For a Duke western, the ending is a little shocking, but the revenge motive works here as the &quot;cowboys&quot; go after the rustlers.  The Cowboys is a beautifully shot movie in the barren desert and the green mountains that deserves a watch to see the Duke in one of his last movies.As usual, John Wayne is excellent as rancher Wil Andersen, who must watch out for the eleven schoolboys turned cowboys.  He takes on a father role to them which is very believable by the end of the movie.  Roscoe Lee Browne is also very good as Andersen's cook, Jebediah Nightlinger, who must deal with more than a little racism on the trail.  Bruce Dern with his rattlesnake theme is incredibly creepy as rustler, Long Hair, although sometimes his character has been called Asa Watts.  The 11 cowboys are all pretty good in their roles including Robert Carradine, A. Martinez, and Alfred Barker Jr.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, production notes, a featurette on the making of, and trailers from 13 different John Wayne movies.

I have very fond memories of watching this late at night in the San Francisco Bay Area with my brother in the room we shared when I was 11-12 years-old.This set actually comprises only one-half of the original 26 episodes that aired in its only season in Britain (1969-70).  Why the remaining 13 episodes are not included here is a mystery to me.  Clearly, since they are calling this ""Set 1"" there is also a ""Set 2"" planned down the road.This, however, is unacceptable as a COMPLETE series set of 26 episodes is out in the U.K. for roughly the same cost, but unfortunately cannot be played in U.S. machines.  Why the money-grab from this title which is sure not to sell piles of copies in the U.S.?  Perhaps to squeeze maximum dollars from those who WILL buy.  Shame!",Randall and Hopkirk

It has been my favorite for a decade and will probably remain as such for a decade longer....or more.My only beef with this set is this - the extras are disappointing. What you get is three features, none of which are longer than an hour, all of which amount to the principals hamming for the camera, talking about what a wonderful film 'Shawshank' is and what an honor is was to be involved. The 'Charlie Rose' show included here, featuring Freeman, Darabont and Robbins, is the most informative about the production, but its hard to sit through four guys gabbing about a movie for an hour.That said, Darabont does a wonderful job with his commentary. However, it was NOT worth paying 18 bucks to replace my old version of Shawshank.

Bottom line: whether you think the new movies (Phantom and Clones) suck or not (they do), I don't want to see cameo appearances by the new cast (especially in what was one of the most emotionally satisfying scenes in the trilogy: Luke see the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his father).I have resigned myself never to give Lucas another nickel.",Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition
337695,"The tone, the style, the rhythm, the visual effects of this Exorcist II are totally incoherent with the previous film. No subliminal shots were used. As a matter of fact, I found the film is a bit disturbing due to quite alot of hand-held shots spinning you around and some terrible women screaming noise.Well, after all, it's not really that bad in terms of the storyline. To be fair, it depends on what you're seeking from this film. If you're expecting the horror shocking visual effects and exorcism as Exorcist I, oops...wrong direction. You will be quite disappointed. However, if you watch the first Exorcist and just want to know more what's going on with Regan, how Father Merrin actually died, and who's the demon inside Regan, you should get all your answers from this film.

837992,"The Fourth Season of Star Trek Voyager saw the departure of the beloved Kes and the arrival of the new character of Seven of Nine.  For some odd reason the ratings increased after her arrival...hmm?  There are some really great episodes in this season.  Much of the season deals with integrating Seven of Nine...the ex-Borg...into the crew.  The season begins with the resolution to the Scorpion cliffhanger, and boy did they resolve it well!  The season also introduces a new villain to the series...the Hirogen.  They're more elusive and interesting than the Borg which is a welcome change.  These two main ingrediants with a little bit of Alpha Quadrant, another time travel scheme, and hope of getting home makes a recipe for a great season of television.Best Episodes:Scorpion: Part II, The Gift, Day of Honor, Revulsion, The Raven, Year of Hell: Parts I and II, Message in a Bottle, Hunters, Prey, The Killing Game: Parts I and II, Vis A Vis, The Omega Directive, Living Witness, One, Hope and Fear",N/A
210536,"In the summer of 1957, a young boy drowned at camp Crystal Lake. One year later, two frisky camp counselors were stabbed to death. The camp has been known as &quot;Camp Blood&quot; ever since. In 1978, a man named Steve Christi decided to re-open the camp. It was the worst decision of his short life. FRIDAY THE 13TH is the classic original in what has become a monotonous stream of inferior sequels (10 to date and counting). Yes, there is a &quot;body count&quot;, but at least there's a good, creepy story to carry the carnage! Long before there was a mindless, invincible stalker and his 20+ year murder spree, there was the REASON for it all. In this first movie, we get the actual motive for all that hideous rage and it's gory result. This is a tale of vengeance fueled by insanity. Yes, we get to see WHO is killing the new arrivals at Crystal Lake. More importantly, in this one we get the answer to WHY they are dying. Yes, there is a Jason Vorhees. However, there is someone else who is equally frightening. Someone who will stop at nothing in order to exact revenge. This person is bitterness incarnate, compelled to destroy in order to feed the inner demon. To get &quot;justice&quot; for something that cannot be made right. We get a quick peak at the agony that started the bloodletting. This is rare in this type of movie! A well told campfire story, best viewed alone on a dark, rainy night. Highly recommended...",Friday the 13th 1 VHS

There were so many people missing from this movie that they should have called it ""Nobody was Interested in a Third Slice.""Even the reliable Stiffler character was getting old by now. To change him up a bit the directors tried to reverse the roles of Stiffler and Finch. It didn't work. Also by now you have to really wonder about Stiffler. Outdancing a gay man in a gay bar is not something he would want his next score to know.And what was with the bachelor party scene? It made no sense. Why throw a bachelor party for three people and the groom isn't even around? Of course the strippers were hot, espescially the cop.Ok gross out scenes here were Stiffler eating dog poop, a wedding cake covered in pubic hair, and the granny love closet. The best thing in this movie was Stiffler's 1979 black Trans Am. I wish I still had mine.But by now the jokes were old, the characters (well the ones who showed up anyway) were just going through the motions, and Jimbo is still a quirky buffoon, but he can dance now.And of course at the end you know Stiffler's mom is showing up.",American Wedding
160978,"Edit: The core point below is that clashes of millions of adherents of different religions, i.e. Catholic versus everyone else, Muslim versus Hindu, are not new, and the past does indeed demonstrate that force of arms is an ineffective means--indeed a pathological means that makes it worse--for addressing such schisms.  Gandhi, and Gandhi alone, has shown the way with proven success at the level of Nations and Peoples.9-11 focused some of us, but not enough of us, on the monumental issues of war and peace such as have not occurred since World War II--the Cold War being, as Derek Leebaert documents so well in ""The Fifty Year Wound"", a false war, one with enormous costs to all mankind.I bought this video recently--having seen it many years ago--to refresh my memory on the essence of Gandhi and his proven concept of non-violent resistance.  The DVD capped several years of reading in the non-fiction national security arena (see my other 470+ reviews on war and peace), and has proven to be the ultimate primer as well as the ultimate Master's Seminar.This is the movie to watch if you want to get down to fundamentals; Gandhi's three basic lessons of war and peace as shown so beautifully here are these: 1) the only devils are in our own minds; 2) the separation of Pakistan and India, like the separation of Palestine and Israel, violated the civil order between Muslims and Hindus, and destroyed all that Gandhi had achieved: peaceful coexistence of peoples within a single nation; and 3) in the end, after great pain, truth and love inevitably triumph.Although I was tempted to fast-forward to the current six-front 100-year war between radicalized Islam and militarized America on the one hand, and between impoverished billions and corporate America on the other, I paused to reflect on the past first.  It was the Spanish who first committed genocide against the American Indians, who expelled the Muslims and then the Jews, who sponsored the Inquisition and the Crusades.  It was the British who stupidly pitted Muslim against Hindu in their attempts to assert their imperial will--nothing makes them look as stupid as the movie's coverage of how the ""Empire"" forbade the locals to take salt from their very own sea: the Indian Sea.Now I fast forward to our current circumstances, with special reference to Jonathan Schell's ""Unconquerable World,"" perhaps complemented by Clyde Prestowitz' ""Rogue Nation"" (the US), and Chalmers Johnson ""Sorrows of Empire""--and the other 470+ books relevant to war and peace today.  Bottom line: boy, have we screwed this up.  First off, invading Afghanistan made Al Qaeda stronger, not weaker.  Second off, invading Iraq has made America weaker, not stronger, and inflamed the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Africa, the Pacific Rim, and the Muslim populations in the Americas.We need a Gandhi.  I cannot think of any modern leader who is even close, although the current Pope has certainly tried.  This movie depicts, in terms stark and relevant, the opposite of 9-11--the clash of mobs driven by ideology or religion, completely oblivious to the core facts that Gandhi tried to teach: non-violence, love, truth, the Golden Rule.  All else is evil.If you have time for just one serious DVD, this is it.",N/A

823375,"Bertolucci's mastery of the visual medium is front and center in this film---every shot is gorgeous, Eva Green's willowy grace packs a huge wallop and more than maintains viewer interest (at least THIS viewer's, hee hee), and Paris doesn't look too shabby either.  In something of a departure for Bertolucci, the soundtrack is also prominently featured, mostly 1960s classic rock tunes with a large dose of Hendrix.Which leads to one of the film's biggest weaknesses: the casting of Michael Pitt, who does a cover version of Hendrix's ""Hey Joe"" on the soundtrack.  His musical performance parallels his acting performance: relatively competent (it's not terrible), but far from spectacular (it could be a whole lot better).  He resembles Leonardo DiCaprio, just a taller and meatier version, but alas without DiCaprio's volatile talent---this comes out whenver he confronts the other two principals, Pitt has one of those baby-faces that's impossible to take seriously even when he's supposed to be undergoing the most intense emotions.  The guy is way too bland, white bread and innocuous---we never really sense or see any complexity, darkness or shadowplay in him, it's as if he got lost on the studio lot and wandered into the wrong movie.The other major weakness of the movie is the plot itself, or what there is of one: conflicts are gradually built up, but never truly explode, instead usually fizzling out or inexplicably vanishing as Bertolucci shifts into the next segment.  You keep expecting eruptions from both of the twins, some cathartic outbursts of physical and/or emotional violence...but it never comes.The last shot of the film, of oncoming hordes of black-uniformed French cops charging student demonstrators in Paris, is beautiful and intriguing.  The French twins have stayed to fight the cops, the American has walked away saying that all violence is wrong.  It's slow motion, with no sound---just an Edith Piaf song (""No Regrets"") which begins at its peak, then briefly shares the soundstage with a Jimi Hendrix tune (""Third Stone From The Sun"") before fading away so that we are left with is Hendrix's psychedelic riffs as the credits roll across a black screen.The subtext is clear: this film is not about any ordinary 3 horny and slackerly postpubescents ""coming of age"" but rather an allegory of American and French culture, and their unique interplay.  They are both attracted and repulsed by each other, and in the end they must go their own separate ways to their own separate destinies---France, to decline and oblivion (the 1968 riots are romantic replays of its 18th century revolutionary glory) while America, to world dominance of its deeply ambiguous culture as exemplified by Hendrix's distorted yet melodic music, at once dreamlike and brutal.Even if you don't get or agree with the subtext, this is still a gorgeously made film, well worth the 2 hours.",The Dreamers
546400,"The first season introduces us to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), a pair of FBI agents who specialize in cases that defy conventional understanding.  Mulder is an intuitive genius with a passionate belief in the existence of aliens and the paranormal, fueled by the abduction of his sister when he was nine years old.  Scully is a medical doctor, equally brilliant but rational and skeptical, unwilling to believe in anything outside the bounds of known science.  Their relationship, antagonistic but respectful and laced with sexual tension, provides the anchor for one of the best television series ever produced.These episodes just get things rolling.  They are self-contained whereas later seasons will develop a complex (too much so, actually) mythology.  We are briefly introduced to the Smoking Man (William B. Davis), Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and the Lone Gunmen (Tom Braidwood, Bruce Harwood and Dean Haglund), who comprise a major part of the rich supporting cast that will develop.  Stand-out episodes here include ""Beyond the Sea"" (a serial killer channels Scully's recently deceased father), ""Ice"" (a deadly parasite infests an Arctic research station), ""Fallen Angel"" (Mulder races a secret UFO retrieval team to contact a downed alien), ""Squeeze/Tooms"" (Doug Hutchinson gives a brilliantly creepy performance as a dangerous mutant), and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" (which sets in motion the alien conspiracy subplot)./",The X-Files - The Complete First Season
818858,"Gravitation is a story about a complicated love affair based on Maki Murakami's mangas. This story revolves around the world of Schuichi Shindou, an up and coming rock star. Everything is going well for Shuichi until half American-half Japanese romance novelist (and apple of the ladies' eye) Yuki Eiri cassually crushes Shuichi's faith in his abilities. It's all downhill between the two from there. A hilarious love-hate relationship.Let's be honest up front: Gravitation is a gay romance, but there is so much more to it. It's not a sexual romp based anime... there is a story, and it's a good one. That being said it's very fruststrating watching poor Schuichi be built up and shot down over and over again.Why is Gravitation worth your time? Because it tells a great story about where persistence will take you in love and in life, and if that doesn't float your boat, it's a love story between cute boys!Fans of the Manga will note that the anime has been chastised in the sexual department, and for some reason they found it necessary to nix most of the beginning to the story.

558112,"""Since You Went Away"" is David O. Selznick feeble attempt to turn a simple war time melodrama in a contemporary ""Gone With The Wind."" Running just under three-hours - and with enough tear-jerking moments to stock up three films, this cry-fest extraordinaire was meant to be a sincere tribute to all the families who stayed behind while their men went off to fight in World War II. Claudette Colbert stars as Mrs. Anne Hilton, the dutiful wife and mother of two evangelic daughters, Deborah (surprise, surprise - Jennifer Jones) and Briget (Shirley Temple - all grown up and not nearly as effective as during her childhood tenure at Fox). Selznick's screenplay concocts Anne as the veritable to0-good-to-be-true model of courage and strength on the home front. However, after the first hour or so, charting the family's day-to-day life and struggles get to wear a bit thin on the mind and heart.In retrospect the doomed romance between Deborah and departing serviceman, William Smollett (Robert Walker) seems foreshadowing to the end of Walker and Jones marriage in real life. Guy Madison - a Selznick `discovery' whom the producer hoped would pay off in the same way as his earlier finds, failed to catch on, though in this film he is particularly used to good effect as the all American fighting boy in blue. Despite its shortcomings, ""Since You Went Away"" was a resounding box office success when it was released and was nominated for a truck-load of Oscars. But the tide of favorable preference in Academy voters had begun to turn against Selznick films by this time. ""Since You Went Away"" took only one statuette home for its moody and evocative black-and-white cinematography.MGM's DVD is rather impressive. The B&W; picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract.

157939,"When I first found this film I wasn't sure whom it was about.  I recognized the name from the title, but I was pretty sure that it wasn't all going to be about Andy Warhol.  I was perplexed and ready for yet another adventure down the path of our nation's undiscovered history.  When I first started watching this movie I knew nothing about Valerie Solanas.  She is not in the history books labeled next to Andy Warhol, or is she one that oozes sympathy.  Solanas is a trash talking, independent thinker that somehow found herself next to one of the most modern men of our century, Andy Warhol.Lili Taylor helms this unbridled beast Solanas like no actress I have seen before.  I honestly felt as if Taylor had transformed herself into this brutal feminist.  After the first ten minutes, I didn't even recognize Taylor because she had successfully transformed herself into this insane (?) character who carried this film on her shoulders.  Taylor plays this woman who, for reasons unknown, constantly seeks Warhol's attention and approval.  When Andy refuses to devote his entire attention to her, her mental stability begins to fail.  In hopes to bring her back into the spotlight, and hopefully demonstrate to the world her manifesto, she does what the title of this film suggests.  Sadly, this has the opposite effect and she is forced to live with the act that she committed instead of the words that she has written.Taylor was phenomenal in this role.  She stole the scene from everyone and was never afraid to take Solanas to the next level.  Thankfully, she has some help from some amazing back-up stars to only help boost her performance.  Jared Harris is superb as Andy (one of the best reincarnations of him) and Stephen Dorff blazes onto the scene as Candy Darling.  Oscars should have been handed out for their parts in this film, but unfortunately this was yet another film the Academy ignored.Outside of the acting, director Mary Harron does a fabulous job of setting the scene and building the image of this era.  Warhol was a genius, and because of his fame and notoriety he somehow attracted some of the most interesting people in the world.  This is one of those stories of a woman that wanted to attach herself to this great man, yet somehow couldn't.  Harron directs these actors to show this with perfection.  Her brash cinematography and direction seem to blend perfectly in this boiling pot of history.  Her mix of documentary and biography genres works well in this film.  She commands attention behind the camera, and her actors react with positive responses.  This was a gritty story not for everyone's tastes.  It was a very true story that is more than just Andy Warhol, but also develops themes of feminism and women's rights.  Was Solanas crazy?  I don't think so, I just think she was ahead of her time and not afraid to be herself.Grade: ***** out of *****",N/A

190301,"&quot;The War Room&quot; is an interesting documentary that shows you just exactly what goes on behind the scenes of a presidential campaign and all of the problems that can arise.  Mostly centered around the Clinton campaign, we get a look at a man who is determined to be the next President of the United States.  James Carville and George Stephanopoulos are the main brains behind the campaign, and they show it with their rapid thinking and reactions.  The road to the White House proves to be a bumpy one for Clinton and company, as scandals surface and tabloid articles flood the newsstands.  The people behind the campaign of Bill Clinton never get a break as they always have to be on their toes and figure out damage control.  Even though you know how it all ends, it is still a tense and shocking film.What I love the most about this documentary is that there is no overall narrator, and there really isn't an agenda to it.  The film doesn't force-feed you a likable Clinton.  The film's real purpose is to show you what happens during these campaigns.  Even though it's centered around Clinton, this film really could've been about anyone.  The film doesn't sugarcoat anything as it gives you the raw footage and shows you how both sides can play dirty.  It was amazing to watch Carville and Stephanopoulos work the way they did, as I had no idea how much of an important role they played in Clinton's campaign.I think this documentary can be enjoyed by anyone who is interested in how the system works.  You really don't even have to like Clinton in order to enjoy it, as the film isn't trying to make it look like Clinton is a saint or anything like that.  It is about how dirty people in these campaigns can fight, and it occurs on both sides.  And since there is no overall narrator, there is really nothing in here that tells you that you should feel a certain way about it all.  The DVD contains no special features, which is a shame.I really enjoyed &quot;The War Room,&quot; and I'm not a real big fan of politics.  I think it presents an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes.  If you're looking for an entertaining documentary that is funny and tense, then this is definitely something you should consider checking out.  A big triumph on all fronts, if you want my honest opinion. -Michael Crane",N/A
825298,"I have mixed feelings on Iron Jawed Angels. One the one hand, it tells the story of a very important (and relevant) moment in American history--the movement for national women's suffrage.As a film, Iron Jawed Angels works. On first viewing it is very arresting (no pun intended) and involving. It is filled with great actresses and gets good turns from an aging Patrick Dempsey and a seemingly getting younger Bob Gunton (he sure didn't look this good a decade ago in The Shawshank Redemption).Like most movies of this genre, the historical accuracy is slain on the altar of story-telling. In a story like Ms. Paul's this is unneccessary and annoying. This story has more than enough to it to carry a movie without any ""improvements.""I can understand the poetic liscence with the voting at the end, but why must we make up a Senator and his wife to live this battle out in the microcosm of their family? It is tedious and steals the thunder of the history to have this man use his position to ""rescue"" these women.One person did make a big fan of me in this movie. That was Frances O'Connor. She steals this film as Lucy Burns. My wife likes all the Austen flicks and I actually brought home The Importance of Being Earnest, so I have had the pleasure of watching Ms. O'Connor's work before, but she is at the top of her game in this film.Unfortunately, on a second viewing of this film, she was one of very few things that held up twice. The soundtrack and cinematography that make the film grab you the first time around--to put it in a nice way--wear quickly.The soundtrack in particular will date itself horribly in the next decade (an aside: my brother once said the same thing about the humor in Disney's Alladin. I thought he was splitting hairs back then, but man, was he right.)So...now comes recommendation time: Iron Jawed Angels is a visually stunning and historically important movie. However, the visuals and the music get old fast and the history is, if not suspect, juiced up a bit.Watch the movie and make up your own mind. Frances O'Connor's performance is worth a look, if nothing else.",Iron Jawed Angels
591080,"After hearing all the prasie for this movie, I decided to finally rent the DVD.  I might be in the minority here, but as I watched it I could not help but feel that I had somehow tuned into a bad, boring Lifetime made for TV movie. I kept expecting Judith Light or Shanon Doherty to appear.  The performances were not compelling, and I can't for the life of me understand how Kidman received such priase for this yawner.  I guess if you stick a big piece of bubblegum in the tip of your nose, ugly yourself up a bit, that becomes award winning acting.  I know I should have felt something for the three women in this story... If not completely understand their pain and struggles, at least acknowledge it.  But, I felt nothing.  Actually, that is not entirely true.  I did feel something...frustrated.  For 2 hours I felt the frustration at these 3 actresses on the screen.  In the end, I was only too happy that it was over.  It is a film that really leaves you feeling empty.  This is not because the performances were so engrossing that you feel the emptiness and pain in these women's lives.  No, you feel empty because you sat dopwn to watch a great movie, and instead witnessed some mediocre movie of the week hogwash.  It is the type of movie that &quot;serious&quot; revieweres will feel compelled to label a masterpiece, even though inside they really wanted it to end as badly as the rest of us.",The Hours
498477,"This forgotten teen cult classic is just great!The horrible acting and plot makes it one heck of a gut-buster! You'll definitely want to add this to your B-Movie list.But surprisingly, this movie doesn't only stand out for its sheer B-Movie brilliance, but also for its brave and unique tones. Unlike every other teen movie from the 80's- this drama/comedy deals with situations that are far more realistic, and in some ways more shocking than your average &quot;Let's Get Laid&quot; movie.The ending is what earns the movie its 5th Star. Somehow, this raunchy screwball teen-flick manages to make the Gary character believable. You suddenly begin to feel for him, and when the story finally builds up to such an unexpected, negative and heartbreaking ending...it reminds you of just how unfair love can be.A very good movie!",The Last American Virgin VHS
762687,"I saw part of this Reading concert on TV once and had wanted it ever since.  When I found out that you also get a 1981 concert on the same DVD, I knew I HAD to own this immediately.I think I must have been shown the best part of the 1998 concert (the part of the set from ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" to ""Blue Monday"").  And yes, they are undeniably great here.  But viewing these two concerts back to back has given me a very different feeling. -- (Cue tacky sound bite from Fleetwood Mac's ""Rhiannon"": - ""what you ha~d, and what you lost..."")The 1981 concert was held at a venue called the Ukrainian National Home in NYC.  Its stage just happened to have a portrait of Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko hanging above it, so they took advantage of this rather bizarre combination by naming the concert after him.  The concert begins with some overly-long shots of various posters in the lobby written in Ukrainian.  (Ooh look, it's words written in Cyrillic!"")  I guess particularly in 1981 at the height of the Cold War they must have seemed quite exotic, but the shots dwell too long here, and combined with some cheesy early video effects, this is the only part of the concert that really looks dated to me.The performance itself is pure brilliance from end to end.  The band's sound still retains the dark intensity of Joy Division that I LOVE, and Sumner's voice seems to hold an echo of Ian Curtis.  And on some songs we even get to see Gillian strap on a guitar and rock out with the boys.  How I miss those days, and what a versatile performer!  The moody lighting also enhances the magic of this concert.Fast forward 17 years, and we have the now veteran group playing to a packed stadium.  They are by no means bad here.  The drumming is every bit as dead-on and inventive as 1981, and Gillian is great as always.  So what is it that bothers me here?Hook has grown crustier though the years, and with experience has developed a bravado for playing to the audience.  But at the same time, I can't help feeling I detect a tinge of ""rock star"" to him completely absent from the 1981 concert, where the band was completely unpretentious and totally absorbed solely in the task of bringing their music to the people.Sumner in particular seems to have changed his singing style over the years, and while it is perfect for their later hits, I had to cringe when they performed a few old Joy Division songs.  While he could easily have pulled it off in 1981, Sumner's voice is just too sweet now, and I found myself wishing they had given Hook the vocals on these instead.Sumner also seems to have picked up a habit of throwing random ""whoops"" into his songs, which he over-uses till it becomes annoying, especially on songs like ""Touched By the Hand of God"" and ""Paradise"", which I did not enjoy at all.  And he has also acquired a habit of striking a typical ""rock star"" stance with right hand held aloft, which he again over-uses throughout the concert, making me long for the sparsely expressive and earnestly intense band of 1981, which seemed the diametric opposite of such stadium-rock posturing.The absence of surround sound on the 1998 concert is missed, but I felt it did not affect my enjoyment enough to warrant taking off a star.The band interview segment is interesting, but the sound level is too low, and combined with the band's accent (-- not to demean the way any of our British brothers and sisters speak, but --), made it difficult for me to understand at times.  But thankfully Rhino has included optional subtitles here, and I found I understood about 50% more with them turned on.Reading this review, people may mistakenly assume that I did not enjoy the 1998 concert.  This is not true.  I loved many songs, even including their much-maligned soccer stadium anthem ""World in Motion"" (--which I never even realized was a New Order song till I saw this concert, its sound being so different from what I think of as the N.O. sound).  But perhaps it is fitting that the second concert ended with this song, as it truly brought home to me the distance they have come from their early roots.  While I do indeed love their more recent dance-oriented songs, seeing the first concert really reminded me of how, --once upon a time--, they had been so, soooo infinitely much MORE than just a great dance band.I am so thankful we have this precious record of their early days on the boldly risk-taking and experimental cutting edge available to us today.  I hope that more concerts from the years between '81 and '98 will become available to us on DVD too (as well as their music videos and ANY Joy Division stuff, please~!!!). In the meantime, I'm going to go and check out ""511"" as well to see how they fared without Gillian.",N/A

The sound quality is excellent reguardless of the shorthandedness of some of the videos.

830288,"Sometimes a marketing idea is just crass and without reedeming value.  But when the Barbie people hit on making computer-animated films featuring their characters, they did it right, and they still do.Like the earlier ""Nutcracker,"" ""Rapunzel,"" and ""Swan Lake"" films, our daughters are introduced to the classic arts in a way they can understand; in this case, Mark Twain's classic tale of a very poor youngster with nothing but a remarkable resemblance to a member of the royal family who would like nothing better than to get away from the responsibilities of royalty for awhile.  While two of the other films featured music quite heavily, being based on ballet, this one is done in the classic Hollywood/Broadway musical style, and the songs are as first-rate as anything you would expect from a big-budget Disney film (as opposed to this film, which could superficially be seen as nothing but a direct-to-video merchandising tool).Martin Short is featured as the bad guy, and as always, he has fun chewing on the scenery and earning the scorn of every viewer.  My little girl loves Wolfie, the barking cat; Sarafina, the elegant feline; Princess Annalise; her pauper double; and Herve, the aging heavy horse.  Oh yeah, there's a young king in town for an arranged marriage designed to save Annalise's kingdom from impending bankruptcy, and even my 7-year-old would say he's okay too.As a daddy I'm more interested in watching other films, of course, but this review is on behalf of my own little princess, who received this for her birthday less than a week ago and has watched it three times.  I could nitpick about the production from an adult perspective, but that's not the point.  My point here is that the Barbie people continue to produce high-quality entertainment for children that's consistently head and shoulders above most such product these days, and I'll never have the slightest reservation in letting my little girl indulge.There are those who may quibble about the political correctness of Barbies, and that's fine, but a 7-year-old girl couldn't care less about such things and is perfectly happy to engage in the princess fantasies represented here.  In any event, this story is modern enough that one of the characters chooses to pursue her career before getting married, so even the naysayers have to chew on that one for awhile.  Good stuff.",N/A

783650,"I think that Christina Aguilera has one of the best voices in music business today. Besides from that she also performs very good on stage. This DVD shows how was Christina's first world tour. The show is very good, has several dancers, the production was flawless and the stage is also good. What I didn't like very much was that Christina cuts some of the songs as the #1 hit ""LADY MARMALADE"". For ""COME ON OVER"" Christina made a very good change taking the song to an unplugged interlude with a little gospel style, ""FIGHTER"" was one of the best songs in he show. For ""WHAT A GIRL WANTS"" you'll see a great introduction. Christina also added a cover, the classic ""AT LAST"", and finally the show ends with ""BEAUTIFUL"". You can find here the best songs of her latest album but the only song missing here was ""I TURN TO YOU"" from her first album from were she sings only the hits.Besides the show you get as bonus features an interview and some extra footage.

616289,"Already one of the best horse-racing epics in film history (for a change, see &quot;A Day At The Races&quot; comedy by Marx Brothers), &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; does not break any new ground, but is a solid, flawlessly produced and at times completely enthralling movie, adapted from a successful book.The thrills come (as one might well guess) from the races the small underdog horse named Seabiscuit won in the 1930's, giving the Depression-stricken Americans something to cheer about. The movie needs a while to really get started and thus is just a little bit long, but eventually the overall craft sported by filmmakers redeems itself as truly impressive; no wonder the movie got seven Oscar nominations, although it converted none.Rock-solid male cast is of a real class -- Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Tobey Maguire and William H. Macy shining in a minor role -- while Elizabeth Banks (as Bridges' second wife Marcela Howard) gets a sound amount of coverage in a film with few female roles. The movie wisely eschews some cliches -- for example, after the jockey Red Pollard (Maguire) is forced to say good-bye to his parents as a youth we never see the mom and dad again, although this might ensure a real tear-jerking reunion. Instead, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is from the beginning to end an assured, safe and almost guaranteed entertainment for all.",N/A

Although this fifth instalment is also the shortest in the films (1 hour and 11 minutes is no exception), I still like it! The story goes like this - It begins when two slick theives, Annie and Oakley, stole a book that tells them about the water city Alto Mare, the sibling Pokemon Latios &amp; Latias (said to have strong psychic abilities and the power to disguise themselves as humans) and the mystical jewel, the Soul Dew, said to have contain an awesome - and dangerous power, if it fell into the wrong hands. Fast forward to present day Alto Mare, where Ash and Misty compete in the annual water race competition, the Tour De Alto Mare. After the race (which Misty won), Ash finds a new interest, a mysterious girl (whom he doesn't know is Latias). After an encounter with Annie and Oakley, Ash and Pikachu follow human-disguised Latias to a secret garden, where he meets Latios, Bianca (the human form of Latias disguise) and Lorenzo, her grandfather. Lorenzo explains the legend of Alto Mare to Ash, unaware that they are being watched by the two thieves...(Sorry I can't give you any more details, that's a MAJOR SPOILER!)Anyway, this is the best Pokemon movie I've ever saw this year!",N/A
821515,"This film is 'inspired' by the real life story of Jackie Kallen, the first sucessful female boxing manager (herself appearing as one sports reporter -- see the last one in the press conference).  Jackie is played by Meg Ryan who could be really feeling like 'against the ropes' because of these recent flops, but to do her justice, the film, or her performance itself, is not as bad as some people say.  The problem lies somewhere else -- the by-the-numbers script.OK, but the story per se is intriguing.  Jackie Kallen is doing thankless jobs like serving coffee for her insulting boss in the male-dominating world.  Provoked by another insulting promoter played by Tony Shalhaub, Jackie accepts his challenge, and takes a street-wise boy Omar Epps under her wing, to make him new champion.  She also enlists a help from the retired trainer Charles S Dutton (who also is the director of the film).Meg Ryan, often dressed in colorful and sexy clothes, and doing lower and deeper voice than she usually is, is clearly trying to look and sound like Jackie, with aggressive and foul-mouthed attitudes.  That works at first, but soon it gets obvious that she is acting ... not bad acting in itself, but still acting, or I should say, faking.  In her good films in the past (even the brief scenes in 'Top Gun') she was not faking, being always very natural.  Even that fake orgasm in 'When Harry Met Sally...' was not a fake.The major defect of 'Against the Ropes' is this -- it doesn't  look real at all.  Whatever the truths about Jackie Kallen story, the present story is made with old formulas -- initial humiliation, small success, ego-tripping act, hero/heroine's regret, then final showdown -- all of them give us the impression that the film is white-washed.  And this story is told too slowly.With Omar Epps whose biceps convince us of the character he is playing, and the long-awaited final moment which succeeds in creating the excitement of the boxing, 'Against the Ropes' ends with a great conclusion.  I wish the process coming there were constructed with some originality, or tighter direction.",Against the Ropes
526866,"The plot of this story is revolves around a college student, Josh Parker(Meyer) who recruits a group of dorm buddies to help him get from New York to Texas in order to intercept a mistakenly mailed video tape of himself having sex with another girl, before it falls into the hands of his girlfriend.  On paper, it looks like a winner and I expected to see something like a cross between Vacation and Van Wilder.  However, while you might expect this kind of movie to be loaded with side-splitting high jinks, I found the humor highly predictable and the characters flat at best.There are 3 main characters besides Parker and they are all pretty cliche.  First there is E.L. (Scott), as the obnoxious instigator.  There is Rubin Carver (Costanzo), as the eccentric pot-smoking A-student.  Of course, there is also the pathetic 98-pound straw man virgin Kyle Edwards (Qualls), who is the butt of everyone's jokes.  As the plot progresses: the pathetic virgin is deflowered; Carver smokes pot with an old man, and E.L. steals a short-bus and discovers the joys of prostate stimulation.  Like I said, it sounds good on paper, but every gag is telegraphed from a mile away.On the upside, while the humor is flat, the plot is kind of engaging.  The main reason that you will keep watching this movie is to find out whather or not Josh gets to Texas in time to intercept the videotape.  You will appreciate the consistency and linearity of the storyline, which is not diluted by the inclusion of too many subplots.  It really is a good road movie, if not a good comedy.On the downside (except for Scott and Smart) the actors in this flick have about as much screen presence as a rock.  While the characters might have been written as one-dimensional stereotypes, at least they could have played thier roles with some enthusiasm.Still, Road Trip is a fairly engaging movie but only because of the main plot.  As a comedy, however, it is pretty flat.",Road Trip

It quickly turns from platonic to lust without the characters at least getting to know each other well. . .just another movie with empty, meaningless sex.  I found it stupid and offensive.

Although he feels his new command is unable to fight, his superiors put the troops to the combat test. As they fail, Cruise is captured and taken captive by the samurai.

Eddie does great on WWII, the dryness of the Anglican Church, James Mason as God, British actors playing Star Wars villains and Nazis (wrangle up some bloody Germans), Empires, Italy, NRA, and other topics that most don't use for punchlines.  Eddie Izzard is hilarious.  When I bought this I figured it was worth a watch and could be auctioned if I did not like it.

340822,"It is said by the great man himself that this is the closest he has ever got to making a sort of autobiographical film &quot; and I don't want to come any closer &quot; he feels. And in some respects you have to agree with him. The acting all round is superb and unlike in many of Cronenberg's films where the actors are almost wooden in their performance, none of them here are wooden in their performances. There's a sense of realism in this which you won't get from any other Cronenberg film. There's always a creepy sense &quot; of what might happen &quot; than the &quot; wham bam you're dead &quot; sort of horror movieYou don't really need me to tell you the story of the film since many others have commented on it. But I will say this is that Oliver Reed plays his part well. There's always an underlying threat of menace in his voice even when he's trying to convince Frank that he's on his side ( although you probably wouldn't think it at the time )And as for those side effects that these people have while in his therapy are truly one of the most revolting things you'll ever see. Even though this film is menacingly restrained yet emotional, it'll take a strong stomach to see one of the more gruesome scenes of the film ( although it ain't as gruesome as Scanners or Videodrome )However this is a film that has to be watched purely being for the reason that this maybe the only time that Cronenberg makes a highly personal movie.",N/A
210468,"Dragonslayer is one of my favorite films, for several reasons.Firstly, the performances are excellent.  They're believable, restrained, convincing portrayals that never stoop to cartoonish stereotypes.  The costumes and sets are first rate and authentic to a tee.  The locations are breathtaking, filmed in Wales and the Isle of Skye - the countryside looks as though it has produced its fair share of dragons and wizardsSecondly, the plot and script go deeper than the surface.  There's a lot more going on here than just good versus evil, wizard versus dragon.  The way that Ulrich (Ralph Richardson) regales himself in proper sorcerer's attire so as to make the right first impression is great.  With little dropped lines the director and screenwriter create a very rich and complete world.  Ulrich asks the travelers why they don't go talk to such and such other wizard...or how about those sisters that are witches?  ""Or what about Old Grimbold?  I heard tell he slew a dragon once...""  ""They're all dead.  You're the only one left.""  With just a few seconds of screen time we get an image of a world in transition, where the old sorcerers are dying out along with the dragons.  The times they are changing.  The politics at work in the court of the king of Urland are as true to reality as if they had happened last week.  All the give and take and the hard decisions a leader must make are there to be seen.  A village community under immense stress is shown honestly, and the ways they react are true to life.Thirdly, and this is what has kept me loving this film for the last 20 years, is that this film more than any other dealing with this subject matter, even more than Lord of the Rings, makes me wonder what it was really like in that age of the world.  What was it like to be in Britain at the turn of the tide between paganism and Christianity?  The hope of redemption and eternal life through The Church might have felt like thin gruel if a dragon needed slaying, and a sorcerer of the Old School said he could do it.  It's a silly idea, really, but I'm sure that similar sorts of things did happen, back when the world was not quite so old.  There is a wonderful, tiny touch near the end, one you might not notice.  (Spoiler alert.)  Ulrich, back from the dead, meets Valerian again and as he is about to do battle with the dragon, he says a few last words to her.  As he does this, he pauses and picks up the necklace she's wearing.  It's a tiny iron cross, a gift from her father.  And as he looks back at her, there is just the faintest tinge (Ralph Richardson is the master of faint tinges) of recognition in the old wizard's eyes that he is being replaced, that his world of magic is being set aside for one of faith.And that's allright with him.  Perhaps he knew it all along.  Perhaps he's part of the transition; we'll never know.  But he has one last job to do before the new day dawns.  A fine, fine film, marred only by a clunky and somewhat uneven soundtrack.",Dragonslayer VHS

622950,"At one time, around half a century ago, the Western was the dominant genre in film; eventually, however, it got tired and formulaic and is now a minor field, with only one or two movies a year often appearing.  Nowadays, it is the serial killer movie that is one of the dominant genres, but like the Western, it is almost played out, as Taking Lives amply shows.While not the worst in this category, Taking Lives is a mediocre movie which offers little worthwhile.  Sure, there are a couple moments that make you jump, but this is no measure of a quality movie; any film can startle you with a sudden noise.  Instead, the viewer is subject to a tired story about a mysterious killer who takes over the identities of his victims.  It's a been-there-done-that sort of movie.  Even the makers of the movie seem aware of the movie's tediousness and seem to provide a prolonged sex scene with Angelina Jolie only as a reward to those able to stick with the film past the halfway point.After the sex scene, what has been a so-so movie takes a turn for the worst, with absurdities and poor plot twists.  By the end, you've seen the same movie you've seen a dozen times before, just with different actors and sets.  Taking Lives may be an indication that the serial killer movie is a dying genre, with little to offer as far as originality or intelligence.",N/A

To complicate matters he finds that he has a long lost sister somewhere that evil companies are trying to find and he can now suddenly turn into a mutant demon thing that can kick major butt.

120940,"This is the third of five ""Dirty Harry"" films in which Eastwood stars as a San Francisco police detective. By the time the last appeared (The Dead Pool, in 1988), Eastwood had aged and times had changed but Callahan's non-negotiaable values and unorthodox methods had remained essentially the same. What I find especially interesting in this film is the relationship which develops between Callahan and his partner Kate Moore, skillfully portrayed by Tyne Daly. Until now, Callahan has indeed been a ""lone ranger,"" alienated (by choice or circumstance) from his superiors and fellow officers as well as from the criminals whom he pursues with deadly efficiency. Over time, Moore eventually earns Callahan's respect and trust (albeit grudgingly) as they attempt to rescue San Francisco's kidnapped mayor (John Crawford) amidst all manner of mayhem unrelated to that assignment. Credit James Fargo with keeping the narrative flowing smoothly. The supporting cast is solid, notably Bradford Dillman (Captain McKay) and Harry Guardino (Lieutenant Bressler). There is plenty of action, of course, skillfully presented. Despite its lack of much subtlety or nuance, I recommend it to those with a taste for this sort of urban adventure film. Those who enjoy it should also check out Coogan's Bluff and Bullitt (both 1968) as well as The Gauntlet (1977).",The Enforcer VHS

Amazingly they even have Middle Eastern terrorists as the bad guys...who would have ever thought of that?

542040,"Before you watch this film, to avoid being confused you have to realize that the whole movie is played out backwards. A certain scene will play until it reaches the starting point of the scene before it. Christopher Nolan used this technique to put the viewer into the same perspective as the protagonist. He suffers from a short term memory disorder that renders him incapable of making new memories past the point of his accident. During a robbery of his house, he sustained a serious head injury that messed up his memory. So he is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, it's very difficult for him to do because he can't remember new things that he's just discovered. To compensate for this, he has a series of tattoos with the certain facts that he has confirmed. He also takes pictures and makes notes to remember people or places that he's been to. The film is executed brilliantly and showcases the perfect actors. Guy Pearce stars as the protagonist, Leonard Shelby. And the film co-stars Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix, Red Planet) as Natalie, and Joe Pantoliano (Bad Boys II, The Fugitive) as Teddy. The film also has a terrific twist of an ending. 5 stars, one of my favorite films.Sidenote: This DVD edition, the Limited Edition, has a very unique style to it. The special features are all easter eggs, as you are presented with a series of questions and then you have to answer them in the right order to reach certain supplements. It is an interesting approach to the new things you can do with the DVD format, but it can get frustrating at times. If you prefer a more straightforward DVD version, there is a single-disc edition available.",Memento VHS
116663,"Do we choose what we are going to do or are we fated to do what we do? Is there fate or is there freewill?This is a really complex question that is not easy to answer. The Matrix trilogy really attacks this question head-on and it never really leaves you with a definite answer. It makes you really think about everything that you have ever seen or done in your life and it leaves you with so many moral and philosophical questions. The people that hate the Matrix movies hate it because they can only see what is on the surface. They see people in funny black costumes flying around doing kung-fu. They don't ever see how deep and philosophical the films (or the characters) truly are.I appreciate the Matrix and the Matrix sequels because they truly are the ""thinking-man's"" action films. The people that like The Matrix and dislike the sequels aren't really the true fans. They fail to see ""how deep the rabbit hole truly goes.""I think The Matrix series is THE BEST Sci-Fi/Fantasy series ever. I think it's deeper than the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings films will ever be.This film is the film that started it all. Buy it and it will truly open your mind.

Monsieur Verdoux is driven to commit murder as he feels determined to provide the best possible life style for his family.  However, Monsieur Verdoux is lost in his determination as it clouds his moral decision making, which he recognizes.  Monsieur Verdoux is the darkest of Charles Chaplin's films, and as in his other films it offers a social message.  This ominous message becomes apparent from the beginning of the film as Monsieur Verdoux's gravestone is depicted in the initial shot with Chaplin's voiceover that embarks on how he ended up here.  Chaplin's direction offers both tragedy and comedy which in the end leaves the audience with a charming, yet disturbing cinematic experience.",N/A
790006,"I don't know what Emily Bronte, one of the best literary minds of all times, would have made of MTV's adaptation of her classic Wuthering Heights! Almost everything would have appeared alien to her, and imaginative guess work can only offer a very modest speculation about what she would have thought of fancy cars and rock music.But one thing is for sure, she would have certainly known the difference between mediocrity and creativity! And alas this newest and loosest of interpretations of her classic masterpiece of love, passion and betrayal would have made her wish she never wrote it in the first place.Modern interpretations of classics are by no means a bad venture, as the examples of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet and Alfonso Cuaron's Great Expectations clearly demonstrate,but the problem with the MTV's version of Bronte's classic is its mediocrity..just a plain, lifeless and average direction and acting. Had the film had a different title, and had MTV did not market it in an 'in your face hip, cool, trendy and young' way, then maybe it would have been much more bearable.MTV's venture into the world of movie making has not been a glorious success so far, and simply because they are following the same approach and mental frame that they take in their musical and reality TV productions, and this is a big mistake.Anyway, the overbearing and passionate  Victorian world of Bronte and her dramatic but sadly short life were very much part of her work, yet her stories with their universal themes do indeed belong to all the ages, and make good movie material, if only the script, direction and acting are good enough to retain the spirit of the book, while infusing it with a modern outlook. The only success of MTV's Wuthering Heights was probably to turn one of the best writers of all time in her grave. Avoid!",N/A

He also manages to slip in a self-aware over-the-top wink to the audience in each performance. The only chink in this guy's kevlar body armor is his desire for Madeline.

563850,"His best: social journalism.  Nobody brings perennially pressing issues to the screen as consistently and vitally as Spike Lee---love or hate his films as you may, there's no argument that he does a superb job of provoking debate and reflection.  Here it's Lee's two favorite topics, racial history/injustice/relations and (less prominently but still significant) gender/sexual issues...treated with a vast amount of humor and often insight.His worst: at times some of his films implode when Lee gets on his soapbox and goes too heavy-handed---the Message blots out the Movie.  This happens towards the last one-third, with the last 10 minutes especially preachy and contrived.  The film craft breaks down, characters and dialogue that before had been pretty much spot-on suddenly verge into labored allegory and caricature.It's like Lee drew up a laundry list of Pressing Societal Problems (brings to mind Larwence Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"") and tried to allot 5-10 minutes for each one.  Sometimes he does so with grace and wit, but sometimes he stumbles into glibness and stereotyping.I was a little disappointed that Lee didn't show more of the actual Million Man march, maybe explore the controversial Louis Farrakhan a little bit more deeply.  I was however pleasantly surprisd that Lee does take a fairly mature, gutsy stand on homosexuality and homophobia absent in some of his earlier films.Had Lee made this film more as a straight (or pointed) documentary rather than trying to turn it into a heavy-handed inspirational treatise, I'd gladly give it 5 plus stars.

He makes a very strong statement about how a very successful company like Paramount can stoop so low to cashing in on tons and tons of money by putting together a quick and cheap collection of THE FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES.  You know what?  Paramount can make tons of money off of this collection and you know why?  Because they can and they are smart because they know that there are tons and tons of stupid people out there who love these movies and would pay a lot to buy it.  I only wish it was the other way around..... SMART people who will only buy a collection of movies that live up to the films itself by including 2 versions of each film (theatrical version & the uncut, undeleted or added extra footage version), along with a director's commentary and special features that includes movie trailers, etc...  Not to forget Paramount should restore back to each of the film's original movie poster for each DVD,  in other words, use the original cover as it was released in theaters and not a new or cheap upgrade picture to replace the old pictures....  what's up with that... I totally hate the new movie pictures,  I rather have the old ones,  just gives it more color and a touch up thats all.Well back to the other subject of stupid people who will cash in on these cheap version from Paramount,  you people out there need to wake up and not buy these movies, save your money and just buy the movies individually or better yet go to EBAY there are tons of them there now.  Trust me I am a BIG Friday The 13TH and HALLOWEEN fan,  but Paramount won't do this collection of Friday The 13TH movies any justice they deserve,  Paramount is even ashamed to have it's name put on these films.  Hopefully those who work or run Paramount company will either sell this to New Line and allow New Line company treat us horror fans to a better, improved collection or Paramount will get off there asses and start working towards putting together a better collection and delete this cheap set and rework on those pictures.

571158,"The year is 1971. Coach Bill Yoast ( Will Patton) has led The Titans to fifteen winning seasons. However since the Titans play for an all white school, the school system decides that it is time to intigrate the school with some African American students which leads to a change on the football field as well. This marks the arrival of Coach Herman Boone ( Denzel Washington). Despite his impressive record, Coach Yoast is demoted to Boone's assistant and Boone is made the new head coach. Boone is extremely tough and opinionated, and likes to shake things up. His coaching methods are met with skepticism and resentment from the entire team when he forces the players to look past the color of their skin and treat each other with respect. Watching Boone and Yoast put aside their differences, and turn a group of hostile young men into champions, will give us all a reason to ""Remember the Titans"".Remember the Titans is an inspiring film that is based on a true story. Disney effectively portrays the story behind the film with talented actors and an amazing musical score. Denzel Washington is great as always. His portrayal of coach Herman Boone is driven with intensity, integrity, and determination. Will Patton gave the best performance as Bill Yoast. He is torn by envy and hate, but still manages to do the best job possible. There was a lot of inner conflict that the character had to overcome, so the transition is really emotional. The football team itself is full of talented young actors that really symolized the spirit of teamwork. All of them do an outstanding job and actually had to go through a football training camp to make their roles believeable. The football action in this film is hard hitting, suspenseful, and realistic. The last thing that amazed me about this film, was that Disney realisticly captured the racism and segregation that went on during that time. It gives an extra sense of tension to the already dramatic film.Disney definately scores a touchdown with Remember the Tians. The acting, emotional story, and realistic look at racism makes for a very dramatic and important film. The film is also fun to watch with the hard hitting and realistic football action. The DVD is amazing. You get two commentaries - one from the real life coaches Boone and Yoast, and the other from the crew members on the film. There are also two featurettes, an ABC special, and much more. This is a must own DVD for anyone's collection.A solid 5 stars...",Remember the Titans VHS

Outwardly he portrays a sort of ""man whore"".  But the more that I have seen this movie, the more that I have ""gotten"" the humor, the meaning, and the sincerity of Ashley Judd's performance specifically.  Ashley Judd really knows how to cry!  There are some classic scenes with Judd expressing her hurt and anger from her last boyfriend (Greg Kinear).  These expressions include men bashing, missing his scent, getting obsessive about the way males think, and wanting just to be loved ""truly"" by a man.  Ashley Judd really knows how to express herself well and her reactions are both priceless and precious!The moral is good, I believe, but I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers that her relationship with Hugh Jackman is not developed as it should be.  You get a sense of how it is suppose to be, but find it a bit unrealistic to ""all of a sudden"" figure out who she really loves.  I say, ""watch it"" and you will be able to relate to Ashley Judd's performance because she seems so real despite her ""out of the blue"" moment.",Someone Like You

79843,"Based on Michael Ondaatje's sweeping WWII novel, ""The English Patient"" is the story of a young Allied nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche) who finds herself alone in an abandoned Italian monastery and tending to a mysterious burn victim (Ralph Fiennes).  Like David Lean's Dr. Zhivago, this mystical and epic film is told through a series of flash backs integrated with a subplot that is supposedly taking place in the present. During the flash backs we learn of the tragic circumstances that have led to the current state of the stranger. Fiennes is Count Laszlo, an archaeologist - and assumed Nazi sympathizer - who is in love with Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). She, unfortunately, is married to the long suffering, dispassionate, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). The two are off gallivanting through the dessert in search of artifacts when the passionate relationship between the Count and Kate ignites. The resulting, all consuming, lust that overtakes these lovers is intricately balanced and compared to Hana's burgeoning romance with an East Indian soldier who defuses bombs, Lt. Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews). Willem Dafoe is brilliantly cast as Caravaggio - a man whose association with the allies (in a flash back) was exposed to the Nazis, the result being that Caravaggio had his thumbs brutally amputated with a switch blade. Caravaggio is determined to brutalize the man he believe is responsible for exposing his secret, the man he suspects is the burn victim lying helpless and dying in the monastery. Winner of nine Academy Awards ""The English Patient"" is a bittersweet love story between four people (two couples) who meet with untimely and destructive forces that ultimately alter the course of their lives forever.THE TRANSFER:This disc was previously released as a flipper from Miramax in a non-anamorphic and somewhat grainy transfer. The previous disc suffered greatly from the intrusion of pixelization and edge enhancement. It also lacked anything in the way of extras. For the most part, these oversights have been corrected on this newly remastered 2-disc special edtion. The picture quality exhibits marginal improvements in both clarity and fidelity, due in large part to the fact that this time around the disc has been enhanced for widescreen televisions. Colors are rich, bold, vibrant but at times tend to be garishly unbalanced. Occasionally flesh tones may appear slightly on the pasty side. Otherwise, there is a deep, textured look to the visual presentation that is thoroughly in keeping with the subject matter. Contrast and black levels are bang on. Fine details are nicely realized. Pixelization still exists and sometimes breaks up finer background information. Also, certain scenes tend to look as though some edge effects have been added. Again, all these shortcomings are relatively minor for a picture that will surely not disappoint! The audio has been remastered to 5.1 and exhibits a very visceral and thrilling sonic experience. The sound of Count Laszlo's plane flying over the dunes is both aggressive and stirring and the musical score is wonderfully spread across all 5 channels.EXTRAS: include a very comprehensive commentary by writer-director Anthony Minghella, producer Saul Zaentz and author, Michael Ondaatje. Minghella has more to say than the other two but all contribute fascinating tidbits to the production of the film and the inspiration for the novel. The deleted scenes segment is presented in a unique way - I won't ruin it for anyone but needless to say it's more refreshing than the treatment usually afforded deleted scenes. The CBC's documentary on the making of the film is somewhat of a disappointment, relying heavily on trailer junkets and very little but sound bytes from cast and crew. A series of featurettes round out the involvement of Zaentz, Minghella and production designer Stuart Craig.  There's also a nice series of interviews with the cast and crew and a great featurette on Phil Brady, the stills photographer.BOTTOM LINE:The culmination of all this extra material and the rather impressive quality of the film transfer lead me to recommend ""The English Patient"" to all who love a good story and a thoroughly engrossing, great film.",N/A

792423,"An enticing and relevant indie effort, ""Thirteen"" stands as a pleasant surprise and a peculiar teen movie. This coming-of-age tale about a 13-old girl (the impressive Evan Rachel Wood, from the TV-Show ""Once and Again"") who suddently begins exploring her darker side isn`t grounbreaking material, yet suceeds as a compelling effort nonetheless.Director Chaterine Hardwicke offers an intriguing debut oeuvre, one that dares to take a deep and risky look at today`s teenagers. ""Thirteen"" presents a strong and vivid visual style, full of energy and dynamism and somewhat reminiscent of MTV. The direction also offers a documentary-like quality, being quite realistic and credible on its approach. Hardwicke manages to develop key subjects such as family connections, sexual initiation, drug and alcohol abuse, school relationships and hierarquies, the access to popularity and many other key issues of urban societies.Although this movie could have been an average and moralistic afterschool special, it wisely avoids easy melodrama and stereotyped situations, presenting a wide-eyed perspective with enough ambiguity and depth. The lead character Tracy changes quite fast (perhaps way too fast), and her search for a different and stronger personality is well showcased here, evolving from a cute, smart and innocent girl to an experienced, trendy and hip ""lolita"" that enters a downward spiral. The movie`s pacing is well-balanced and the powerful soundtrack adds a vital sense of rythm and confusion. The performances are noteworthy as well, especially Holly Hunter as a young and worried mother who doesn`t know how to react to her daughter`s behaviour.(...)",Thirteen

835875,"Although this got nice notices when it was out in the theaters, I still wasn't sure I wanted to see it. Produced by Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, and written and starring several SNL alumni, it had a stigma of stupidity. Yet the reviews said it was smart, funny, and well-done.The reviews were right. For the most part, this is an intelligent movie. The premise is that a home-schooled girl fresh off the plane with her African-studying professor parents would finds the rituals of high school alien. Every so often she sees that world in light of her African knowledge. Graft on the typical story of revenge against the Heathers-like girls who run the schoool, the Plastics, and you've got something that is a fresh enough variant on cliques in school that it's interesting.Surprisingly for an SNL-related script (thankfully, however, not a direct inspiration from any SNL skit, though), the writer, Tina Fey, keeps most of the elements from going over-the-top (maybe it was because her script was based on a book?). If anything, I was surprised that the movie didn't use the kids-as-animals comparisons more, but more might have been strained in this case, and it was probably the right move to be restrained. There's also a wonderful bit with a school bus that gets played on early and then returns for the climax that seems in the end to have been a surprise until you realize they clued you in about it in the first minutes. All of the characters, while based on stereotypes, come across as more real than one usually gets in these teen movies; even the mean girls of the title are understandable.The most annoying thing in the movie was fellow-SNL alumnus Amy Poehler as the alpha-mean girl's very liberal-minded mother. In a couple of gags that the Farrelly brothers would have been proud of, she lowers the entire tone of the movie. Luckily, her part is minimal. (The other SNL cast member, Tim Meadows, however, does a great turn as the school principal.)I'd rank this one with other teen high school flicks such as Fast Times at Ridgmont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, and Heathers.

We witness the effects on their families as both Tracy (Rachel Wood) and Evie (Nikki Reed) find themselves in a self-destructive relationship each exploring the world of drugs and sex and peer pressure.  You can see why each of them are drawn both to each other and to the world they inhabit and it feels more like a documentary than a film.As the film draws to a close the relationship comes apart and Tracy is given a second chance to turn things around while Evie will continue the slow destructive path to who-knows-where.

Knox, the manager, is finally convinced that Roger sees something and reluctantly follows his suggestions which keeps the Angels on a winning streak.Both Roger and JP are foster-children of Maggie.

It turns out that the Angels playing in the World Series are not permitted to receive help from the angels-in-the-outfield. The ball players must win this one on their own power ...Needless to say, one can guess the ending ... However, the plot thickens, as the announcer of the ball game suspects some trick in the Angels winning streak.

Just when Knox intends to announce his resignation at a news conference, there is an unexpected turn of events. The ball players stick together and each stands up declaring, if the manager leaves so will they. The team goes on to win the World Series and the foster children reeive a big surprise, too.

787219,"This is one fine thriller. I'm a big fan of films that keep you at the edge of your seat for most of their way and OUT OF TIME is in exactly that genre of filmmaking. It starts off slow, gives you a little bit of background on the main players, a hint or two about what might happen, some talk about an insurance policy, a husband who beats his wife, extra-curricular marital activities...and then, drops a bomb on us and the lead character, who spends the rest of the time trying to remain one step ahead of Johnny Law.I don't think anyone is going to use the word ""original"" to describe this film's plot, but heck, sometimes even the most basic formula works for thrillers as long as you give the audience characters to care about, a touch of mystery, suspense and hotties",Out Of Time
44991,"Steven Spielberg on the holocaust.  Naturally the kids are cute even as they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide from the Nazis.  Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam Neeson is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives of eleven hundred.  Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and his usual subdued intensity.  We have again all the Nazi horror, in some ways worst than ever.  Here we see a lot of the random shooting of people.  The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow their brains out just to be doing something.  The cattle cars are there and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it, although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn't love or even rape, but could only beat.  And among the guards who are herding the Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is saying, ""here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think the kids are cute.""We humans ought to have our face rubbed in this at least once a decade.  Still I think the actual concentration camp footage seen in, for example, Sophie's Choice (1982), to which Spielberg owes something, is as effective as anything could possibly be. When I see those films, shot by the triumphant Allied forces, I am again reminded that just concluded was the most depraved and horrific episode in human history.  Nothing we have done was worse than the holocaust, although Stalin's purging of Russian society ranks a clear second. I think the fact that Spielberg filmed the whole thing in black and white and then turned it all to color with the shot of the actual Jews (now middle-aged) that Schindler saved from the Nazis was an unconscious tribute to the power of those grainy, flickering shots of horror, part of the legacy of the twentieth century.  Perhaps it was a bit stagy, in the usual Spielberg style; however I have to say showing that one little Jewish girl's red dress (the only bit of color in the movie until the end) was a striking touch: we see her in the red dress when she hides and then when they dig up the bodies we see it again.",N/A

It's the perfect excuse to have a movie night at THEIR house, and make them ante up some wine, cheese, grapes and lots of chocolate, then hunker down for an evening of cornball romantic comedy with a difference.Chances are, with Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman on show, you won't even notice that the storyline is hardly Pulitzer Prize material, but you do stand the chance of busting a seam when Hugh does his Footloose/Saturday Night Fever/Risky Business impression at Lot 10 Downing Street, and Bill Nighy makes like Robert Palmer for a video shoot of the worst ever chart topping Christmas song.  There's also the incomparable Rowan Atkinson, making like Mr.Bean at appropriately inopportune moments.In case you think it's all about the guys (it is - but one can't take sides) there's a brilliant performance by Emma Thompson, and also Laura Linney, who has the worst cell phone ring tone ever invented.  Keira Knightley is more ""Bend It Like Beckham"" than ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in this one, feigning wide open surprise a little too often. She's cute though, even if I always get her mixed up with Natalie Portman, the Amidala girl.There are enough love stories and love disasters here to sink a luxury liner - and yes, there are ""Titanic"" references too.  Even though the couples are for the most part separate little stories, there's a connection running through the movie that really ties them all together.The music is great, the movie is funny, and your friends will have to entertain you at their expense - what more could you ask from a movie?

I would recommend everybody who enjoys action, especially with the six-shooters, to go out and buy this movie, or atleast rent it out.The story is set in the Civil War days. However none of the tree major characters are affiliated with one or the other side. Clint Eastwood and the Villain, both are mercenaries and 'Tuco', a retarded man is a bandit. Tuco and Eastwood come across a piece of knowledge that huge amounts of gold has been dug up in a grave in a cemetry. Persuing this gold is the Villain and Eastwood and Tuco join in the pursuit.The three way duel in the end of the movie is quiet fantastic. It is very original and novel, not to mention different, from standard two way duels of regular western's.Fans of Western and Action genre will definitely love this movie. There is a lot of shooting and Eastwood is at his best. The movie itself is set right in the middle of the Civil War so there are some war scences which add to the action of the movie. The color is magnificient and acting is decent.I would definitely recommend adding this movie to your collection.",N/A

617458,"This viewer hates gratuitous gore and violence in general, wasn't a huge fan of ""Pulp Fiction,"" but loved this film. Tarantino's genius is the ability to get into the heads of people raised on pop culture, harvest all these crazy images from film, TV and music and tie them together into a story line that makes sense and is satisfying on a deep level. He's definitely evolved with this film, which has a moral center in the Bride whether fanboys want to admit it or not. The fights are spectacular and funny at the same time and Uma Thurman actually acts with more than her cheekbones for a change. Topping it off is a fantastic soundtrack which I went out and bought the same night. Only weak point, in my view, was Daryl Hannah, whose acting is sub-replicant level.

795323,"This is my second favorite horror remake right behind &quot;Dawn of the Dead.&quot; I have already reviewed the film once, so now I will talk about the features on the Platinum Series Special Edition. First off you get three commentary tracks, which I don't care for, but lots of people seem to like to listen to this sort of thing. Then you get an awesome 75 minute making of feature that talks about the old TCM and the new one. Then you get a 25 minute documentary feature on the real life sick pycho Ed Gein who influenced the making of the original TCM and many other horror films. This documentary contains real footage and some disturbing photographs and it's quite hard to fathom what Gein actually did to people's bodies. Very morbid feature, yet somehow very interesting. Then you get about 8 deleted scenes. The only one that stands out is Alternate Death of Morgan. In the film Leatherface hooks him up to the ceiling and you hear his chainsaw, but it never shows what he does and Morgan dies almost instantly. But in this deleted scene, lets just say the scene left a much bigger impression in my mind and the film could have benefited from more chainsaw gore since you don't really see the Pepper girl killed either. You also get your promotional stuff: Trailer, Photo Galleries, and DVD-Rom Feature. Make sure you buy this Special Edition version, because for only around $10.00 more you get loads of stuff. Also included in the set is a cool metal display cover featuring Leatherface and 8 Crime Scene Photos. Not to mention the dvd display folds out with a chainsaw background.

613384,"I was surprisingly displeased of this movie. I was hoping for an rousing, epic-long extravangaza. But this film is somewhat of a dissapointment. It has 'extraordinary' flaws even a viewer can spot. It's frantic action from one scene to another provides us without a sense of logic for its characters.The characters, I should say, is lead by ageless Sean Connery. He commands a group of superheroes to fight a villian who wants to conquest earth. Some of the interesting heroes include Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and a stunning vampiress. They're postively good, but don't have that much screen time. That's one of the flaws here. Again, the fast-paced action muddles throughout the film. The script, which makes a great movie, is a fault which the film can't correct. It just focuses on the action! The cast is almost a waste. Connery can't seem to break out and have fun. I guess his confrontations with director Stephen Norrington was a reason. He has no motivation.The visuals are somewhat fair. It was just uninspired. A good thing about this movie was the early 20th-century production design. The climax also is ineffective and leaves too many answers. Even though I haven't read the comic books, fans probably won't like this. I giving this 3 stars because of the relivent flaws, but the good production design helped me from giving this film 2 stars.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

784060,"This film is based on the first screenplay by  brothers Michael and Mark Polish, though it is the third of their trilogy to be filmed.Set in a small Montana town in the 1950s, this is the story of  town with a mythic past that is now doomed.  A dam will submerge the town soon, so there is palpable, imagic tension as three storylines develop: first, a young adopted boy, dying, is returned to Fr. Harlan (Nick Nolte) as his parents leave town, so the priest keeps vigil over the youngster and comforts him as much as possible; secondly, six agents (including James Woods and Mark Polish) with a monetary incentive have been sent to roust out those landholders who refuse to budge, and they have a number of surrealistic experiences along the way; finally, whenever the young boy collapses he encounters four purported angels who seem to be searching for him.It would be interesting to give this premise to a half dozen filmmakers and see the various movies they come up with; in the Polish brothers' case, we get a remarkable melange of images and themes -- angels, death, wings, bearing witness to each other, loneliness and human grief -- all set in a dream-like landscape.  The cast is flawless, the pacing is slow (which makes it easier to enjoy the extraordinary visuals), and the stark situation is emphasized using a variety of techniques to film in color though almost always appearing to be black &amp; white.It's fascinating to listen to the brothers' commentary which tells us, among other things, that these guys were basically bankrupt when they made the film and that their father became the production designer because he was the only person who, when asked to build an ark, just said &quot;How big?&quot;.In addition to a fascinating (and essential) commentary track, extras include a series of featurettes collectively running 36 minutes and called &quot;BareKnuckle Filmmaking: the Construction of Northfork&quot;, which delves into the genesis, production and filming of this remarkable film, including great comments from the actors; a trailer; and a Sundance Channel 4-1/2-minute featurette about the brothers in Montana, their homestate and the location of filming.I'm amazed at the polarity of the reviews on this movie, and would suggest that if you are a person who likes straightforward narrative, this is probably not for you; however, if you enjoy life's amibiguities, mystery, symbolism and earlier Polish Brothers' films -- get this as quickly as you can.  It is unique and breathtaking.  These talented siblings are two of the most innovative visionaries in cinema today.  When others' films are long forgotten, our grandchildren will be watching these films.  These guys are totally underappreciated, and I hope they make films forever.

I remember hearing screams and yells of surprise from both guys and girls in the group.

I enjoyed the movie, but after watching it, I still don't know the answer to that question.The movie's sequence (you can't really call it a story) is primarily centered around a series of rehearsals and performances by Chicago's Joffrey Ballet company, in particular those of its star dancer, Ry (Neve Campbell - I'm guessing at the spelling of her character's name). The performances on and off stage are wonderful without exception, and the behind-the-scenes portions of the movie give us at least a taste of what's behind the beautiful dance steps and costumes.Unfortunately, though, that's really all we get - a taste. We never get to know any of the dancers in any depth or see more than a very superficial view of what their art means to them. There is ostensibly a side story involving Campbell's character and her past and future boyfriends, but neither the story nor any of the characters are sufficiently developed to make that portion of the movie very interesting.The delightfully stern and arrogant dance coach (Malcolm McDowell) is the only clearly developed character; the scenes involving him are amusing enough to be worth waiting for.

If you go to the film's official website there is a whole section about why they decided to remake the film. Many people said the reason they did this movie was so we'd all have a version of Psycho that is in colour. So why not release the original in coloured format? Well that's because the film works as a black and white piece and turning it into colour would probably ruin it's effect. The classic shots would just end up looking tacky! Gus Van Sant states he isn't trying to make a film which would try and sqaush the original because that just can't be done! He's simply creating a film which would be available to a young audience the way the original Psycho was when it was first released because a group of teenagers would rather see a film with good effects and currently popular stars right! Not watch a black and white film with a cast that is mostly dead now. He wants to keep the memory of Psycho going and by doing that has released this film.A lot of people also criticise Vince Vaughn for not playing Norman Bates the way Anthony Hopkins did. Vince clearly states on the website that when he read the book he realized that Anthony had portrayed the character in a completely different way. A better way! He didn't want to risk trying to do that so portrayed Norman the way he is written in the original book. Also personally I thought Anne Heche was great as Marion! Plus Alfred Hitchcock's daughter worked on this movie a lot and she says that her father would be extremely proud and flattered that somebody is remaking his movie.

My brother actually commented that you could almost ""smell the bilge"" whilst watching this movie, and I have to more than agree in it's attention to detail, and wonderful realism. The vast spectacle of it all is let down a little however by a fairly mediocre storyline, but despite this and a marginally annoying ending (let's leave the door open for a sequel) it is thoroughly enjoyable. Certain to be one of the DVD releases of the year there are some nice extra's on the 2nd disc, this collectors edition will run you around and extra $10, but the goodies are worth it, and the standard version has no special features at all. All of the performances are strong, and the power of the movie lies not only in it's breathtaking art direction, but also in the viewer being completely pulled in to the lives and actions of the main characters. Mild violence, and some graphic war scenes probably proclude this from a mainstream family audience, but otherwise it is a true sea faring ""ripping yarn"", full of high adventure, excitement, and plenty of swashbuckling thrown in.

729660,"This unconventional film about a teenage boy struggling to escape the  crushing pressures in his life defies categorization.  While one could describe it as a dark comedy, it is funny only in places, and then in a desperate, cynical way.  But it doesn't take itself as seriously as a true drama.  &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot; works best as a film that is what it is:  the story of Igby (Kieran Culkin), who has been kicked out of every private school his mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon) has enrolled him in and who goes on the lam to avoid the next one.  Igby's father (Bill Pullman) has been in a mental hospital for the past six years, and his mother is a snooty matron dying of breast cancer who spends her time fiercely trying to get Igby into yet another school.  His brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) is  a snobbish self-important Columbia undergrad.  Igby's life is truly messed up, and no one can stand to be in his company for long before they feel like hitting him.  The one thing Igby has going for him is an often charming wit, and that, combined with so many things beyond his control, endears him to the viewer.Culkin shows surprising range as Igby, moving convincingly from sarcastic to resourceful to desperate - and back again to sarcastic.  Claires Danes is spunky and perfectly edgy as the Bennington drop-out Sookie, and Amanda Peet is even better as the sensual non-dancer dancer and junkie Rachel.  Jeff Goldblum turns in a fine performance as DH, Igby's godfather, who, as Oliver says, is finely-tuned for only one thing:  making money.  Susan Sarandon seems to float through this movie until the end, when she, too, reveals astonishing aspects of her character.  Every last character is this film is quirky.This is an offbeat, unpredictable film that mainstream film goers probably won't like as much as those who gravitate toward the unconventional.  Rather than being driven by plot, this is a character movie, with its strength resting in idiosyncrasies, smart dialogue, and acting.",Igby Goes Down

The director, whose boldness is like a blistering piece of annoying garbage on one's face on a cold Norwegian day, states that the, ""Hermitage is the greatest museum in the world."" Just from that statement we can then further evaluate that this film is 1) going to rely on manipulating history for its own plight 2) portraying Russians as 'wonderful people and 3) allowing us to see insignificant pieces of junk stolen from countless of eras in the museum. 4) He is completely insane.The film itself was made on one shot by a half bald cinematographer from Germany who complained of back pain after the whole shoot because he was carrying a mobile camera that weighed 250 lbs. Further touches in the editing room configured rooms with dark shadows and an eerie earth tone that seemed almost 'dead like"" and made it seem like this was a Hollywood film.There's not much in the way of the story except an unknown and unseen drunk, played by the camera itself, finds himself in a dank and stench filled restroom, which is actually the foundation of the Hermitage somewhere around the year 1689 and then he encounters a pretentious and annoying old count played by some Russian oaf. All he does is blather around and look at pieces for unusually long periods of time and comment on irrelevant tokens of opportunity such as a beautiful woman walking by who isnt hiding the fact that she has big [.!.]. They keep going into a time machine, which transports them into the next room of the museum, I kept wishing it was the exit, and they keep on commenting about the pieces and about the situation at hand. It isn't even philosophy because the old Russian crank is a really arrogant jerk and he keeps saying stupid things such as, ""I wonder if the Czar eats with butter?"". Its all terribly boring and we must sit through 2 hours worth of it until the end where a bunch of stuffy extras in period pieces dance around a ballroom with Tchaivsky playing in the background.  Too bad he couldn't film the lot of the peasants who were freezing and starving to death!There's not much to say in the way of art even, because most of it is fake to begin with, there was a fire in the Hermitage during World War 2 in which most of the museum itself was encapsulated within a great fire. Let's hope the director doesn't make a pure film on the virtues of Stalin next. (yawn, yawn)",Russian Ark VHS
346533,"There's something about Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, the same quiet but pensive chemistry that layered ""Ordinary People"". Far as I am concerned that's reason enough to recommend this obviously implausible but ponderous jump through far-fetched political hoops.The premise is so loose it dangles -- an incumbent US president becomes terminally ailed (hints of satire in how that happens) only to be temporarily faux-replaced with a lookalike, who in turn develops a conscience but effortlessly fools the entire coterie of house helpers, senate and the public at large.Some characters such as a certain malicious minister and his crony are so cardboard you could punch right through them, which is indeed what you end up wishing you could do. There's even a cameo by Ben Kingsley, ever the confident propreitor of the moment, as the wrongly accused vice president.Yet, it must be the magnetic screen presence of Kline with his comic chips firmly in place or some fairly resonating dialogue that overcomes the highly porous plotline. I delayed sleep in the wee hours to sit through these proceedings with rapt attention, and the denouement is very rewarding as it wraps everything up in 'correct' ribbons.Political conscience and subdued romance when smoothly blended and lightly stirred make for a very refreshing drink. To this charming social fable that celebrates common man's idealism I say: Slurp.",N/A
236299,"The girl in this movie is the poster child for the lack of child discipline in the world.This film was obviously a stage play converted to film, as the actor blocking and set layout - as well as the styles and primary dialog of the main characters are done as if to an audience. But its just such a great story about an evil little girl, you tend to ignore the faults of the film itself.I have to say that the performance by the little girl is just fantastic - the way her countenance changes in an instant when she doesn't get her way. That was one talented girl, and this is a classic film -- one that my wife and I rent every once in a while (partly to remind ourselves how great our kids are).",Bad Seed VHS
805919,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, as I love the story of Peter Pan, but this version just didn't work for me.First of all, while staying true to Barrie's original story, the first 30 minutes almost appeared to be a remake of Spielberg's ""Hook"" than a novelization of the story. Even the music sounded similar to John Williams' 1991 score. I found myself immediately disliking the actor who portrayed Pan, and most especially, his horrible grin that he felt the need to show every 30 seconds. I wouldn't say he was a bad actor, but he definitely was guilty of overacting during MANY instances of this film, and he just wasn't a very likeable kid in general. The only actor who I disliked more is Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell. I really wish they would have killed her off in the first few minutes because she became VERY annoying. She is a fairly odd-looking person, which I guess fairies are supposed to be, but if anyone on this film was guilty of overacting it's definitely her. All of her ridiculous facial expressions were just plain annoying rather than cute. I really hated seeing her onscreen, and I didn't buy her love for Pan like I did with Julia Roberts in ""Hook."" She didn't seem to have any remorse about trying to have Wendy killed, so it was hard to like this character.The film also contains some ridiculous action sequences that came off looking absurd. At one point there are two children riding on the back of a dog, while lying on their backs. In another, a child is flipped through the air and looks like he's doing cartwheels in space or something. In the opening scene, Pan is trying to catch his shadow in Wendy's room, and breaks or knocks over half of the furniture in his attempt. 10 minutes later, and after the room is destroyed, we're shown that Wendy's brothers are in the same room asleep! I don't know if they were on drugs or what but there's no way they could have slept through that.Cinematography on this film is excellent however. The film makes an excellent audio and video transfer to disc. This is one of the most phenomenal visual representations I've seen of a movie on home video and the colors really stand out, especially during the flight to Neverland.The extras are where the DVD falls flat. No audio commentary, which I feel really would have been nice for such a fantastically visually represented film. Instead, there are about 25 very short video featurettes, averaging 1-2 minutes in length. While interesting, they're all just crammed in there, with no real organization. Some featurettes are organized under the ""Captain Hook"" or ""Neverland Forest"" section, but then have nothing really to do with these and are basically just a bunch of behind the scenes clips. I think they definitely should have spent some more time with this and organized 5 or 6 decent featurettes in a cohesive manner rather than throw a bunch of small clips on there to make it look like there were more extras.Overall, I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, and most likely it will be enjoyed by a younger audience. However, it failed to catch my attention as an adult, and it seems like this is something that could have been accomplished with a few small changes and different casting decisions. The original DVD release presents a beautiful transfer of the film, but if you really enjoyed this movie, I'd lobby for a better edition than the one they currently have out.",N/A

The gov't decided to build a robotic Godzilla, using the original '54 Godzilla bones, to defend Japan from Godzilla.  The battle scenes are decent.  Kiryu knows how to kick butt and obvisiously Godzilla just takes it without putting up too much of a fight.

833239,"In 1996 when Fox News started, I was refreshed to have another view point, a conservative one, but Fox News, as Outfoxed convincincly shows, should just be honest about its ideological perspective instead of chanting the mantra ""fair and balanced."" The film makes it clear that there is this almost diabolical blueprint of a new kind of news--totalitirian news, which claims to have no bias while clearly acting as a right arm of the Republican Party. The use of sexy women, smarmy anchors, bully commentators, lame duck ""liberals"" make for a noxious cocktail of phony news. The scary thing is that it works. Fox News beats the competitition even as its viewers become more and more ill-informed.A criticism about the film: At seventy minutes, it's too short. Many ideas should have been developed. For example, the way Fox went lock-step up to the Iraq war needed at least another ten or fifteen minutes. Still, this is a timely documentary that uses concrete examples to support its case.",N/A

Unfortunately, the staging, which consists of a number of panels showing various Swiss type scenes with what looks like choir stalls in front of the panels, simply doesn't work. At best, it adds nothing; at worst it is a distraction. I would rate the singing 5 stars and the staging 2 stars. Since this long opera is less expensive on DVDs than on CDs, it is still a good buy in spite of it's shortcomings, even if you decide to close your eyes while you listen to it.",N/A

Other characters are Broken sword and flying snow and moon. The acting is very good. The special effects are extrodinary.

Instead, we get a pastiche of well-worn fan-boy story standards--Nazis, Lovecraftian ""elder gods,"" Nostrodamus, etc.--tied together by unnecessary clutter.  And then, every so often, Perlman drops in with an endearing scene, and some great lines.There's no great villain here.

I have six young sons, and nothing gives me greater pleasure than to get cozy on my huge sofa with my popcorn and coca-cola, after everybody's is tucked in for the night, and enjoy some quiet time with a great dvd. Sadly, this movie was a bitter disappointment. I think Susan Sarandon is a wonderful actress, and Goldie Hawn has had her moments (Overboard). Without going into the details of the film, I will try to concentrate my review on the elements of the film. When I excitedly hit the play button, which I was sure would open the door to a whole new soon-to-be favorite film, I was smiling and kept smiling hoping that each line would bring something to smile about. I soon discovered my face hurt from trying to hold my once geniune smile turned phony. I finally had to tell myself that the movie wasn't funny or touching or even well-acted. Goldie's Suzette possessed not one solitary trait that was even remotely endearing. Watching Geoffrey Rush's character, Harry, become ""touched"" while Suzette allowed Vinnie's (Susan Sarandon) daughter to puke all over her while she soothed her through her bad acid trip, was just plain silly. I felt myself feeling embarrassed for the actors. If Goldie Hawn didn't go home from shooting this film every night with a pounding headache or throwing her back out, I would be very surprised. There is no way that anyone could keep their lips pursed like that without some repercussion. And voguing one's boobs sideways, backways, and every way to Sunday can't be good on one's back.  There was no ""feel good"" message, ""no moral"" to this waste of film. Those who have given ""The Banger Sisters"" a glowing review are clearly people who are ""low maintenance"" as far as movies go. They are not dazzled by gripping performances or an intelligent script. Two qualities I always look for. I guess if I am going to devote my valuable free time to watching a movie, it will have to be one worth watching and not this kind of slop. Hey, these people get paid millions of dollars to entertain. Shouldn't they have to earn it?  I could go on and on and on about all that is wrong with this movie, but I won't. Too much time has been wasted already. If you feel as if you want to give this movie a chance, I would strongly urge you to rent it, or better yet, borrow it from someone who owns it.

After his first stop, Max is eating a sandwhich in the car when a body falls four stories on top of it.  He realizes that Vincent caused the falling body, and now, he knows what he is dealing with.  For the sake of his own life, he continues to drive Vincent.They make another stop to exterminate another guy.  No biggie, just part of the job.  Then they go to a jazz club.  Max believes Vincent is just going there to buy the two a round of drinks.  He later realizes, that there is another target at the club.  Vincent murders this guy in front of Max, and he sees Vincent at work first hand for the first time.Then, Max gets word that his mother is worried about him.  Turns out, his mother is in the hospital, and he always visits her when he gets off of work.  In order to not make suspicion, Vincent tells Max they need to visit the hospital.  While there, Max steals Vincent's briefcase, which has his list of targets inside it, along with other things like money, ammo, and such.  From here, Vincent chases Max, but Max throws the case over a bridge, and everything is lost.So, they must go see a man at a club to get a new list.  Here, Max has to pretend and pass as Vincent.  Max has to go in because Vincent cannot reveal his identity.  So, the FEDS believe Max is Vincent, but a narcotics officer (Mark Ruffalo) knows the truth.  When they go to a club for the next victim, trouble stirs, but the job is done.After this incident, Max decides he must take command.  So, he wrecks the vehicle, and Vincent runs away.  Max believes his night is over, but realizes that the next target on the list is of a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) that he had given a ride to earlier that night.  So, now, he must turn into a hero a save the girl.  This leads to a high speed chase on foot that is a race against the clock and Vincent.This movie is really good.  A lot of the film depends on the acting and the quality of the acting.  Can you see Tom Cruise as a villain?  You can after seeing this film.  Cruise really does have a wider range of acting than that big-smile good guy type.  He still has his smile, but it even looks sinister.  It may be his best performance since the film Magnolia.Jamie Foxx is also very good.  Most of the film works on the two main character interacting with each other.  Foxx is able to display his emotions to the point.  I thought he was good in Any Given Sunday, but here, you know that he can really do more than comedy.  He's grown up since his days on In Living Color.Collateral really does grip the audience.  You cheer for both characters.  A lot of people are seeing this movie to see Tom Cruise as the bad guy.  That's a good thing because he gives a great performance.  He's an actor.  He does it for a living.",Collateral

Releasing 63 films in the last 13 years, he's certainly a busy man, and he does his best to make some of the most bizarre movies out there, this being no expection.The first problem with this DVD is the actual DVD.It has no DVD Menu, no Sound options (Japanese Stereo + English Subtitles), and no extra features. The movie does have 3 trailers for other films which play right before the movie (Much like a VHS Tape). The video on the DVD Is nothing special either.The story follows young Riki (A model high school student), son of one of the biggest crime lords in japan, who murdered his other son (Riki's brother) -- Riki swears to avenge his brothers death, and recruits a group of bizarre people from his school (Including a man known as the japanese elvis!), to take out his father, and gain control of the Yakuza.The movie sounds real interesting (And when you see some of these characters (For instance, the girl who shoots poisonous darts out of her privates)), it truly is bizarre.Unfortunately the story doesnt unfold so well, and is a large letdown (I wanted to love this movie after hearing about it).It does feature Miike's typical ""over the top violence"" at parts, but its not as good as his typical films unfortunately.I'd recommend renting this one, but I'd hold off on purchasing this movie unless you can find it for under $10.",N/A

Not only is the movie beautiful to look at, the acting is top notch and the story line is refreshingly crisp and intruiging.Daniel Auteuil is the witty and bold Lagardere, who has vowed to avenge the death of his friend and fellow swordsman, the Duke de Nevers, who has been assassinated on his wedding day by his treacherous cousin. Lagardere must then raise the Duke's daughter and somehow regain her birthright. Interspersed through the story is exceptionally choreographed sword play, a love story and a Monte Cristo-like plan of revenge.Auteuil is lovable and dangerous at the same time as Lagardere and somehow convincingly pulls off being the main romantic lead as well, even though the age difference between he and his paramour is something that most American audiences shy away from. Vincent Perez as the Duke was a wonderful touch. He's frivolous, prissy and hedonistic, but he's also a dangerous man with a sword, in fact more dangerous than Lagardere, and he's also a loving man to his wife and child he hasn't seen and comes out being downright likable. Marie Gillain is spunky and charming as Aurore, the Duke's daughter and Lagardere's ward. She's truly her father's daughter and more than a match for Lagardere.As with the Count of Monte Cristo, this is a revenge movie at heart with a lot of heart in it.

My favorite Chevy Chase movie is definitely ""National Lampoon's Vacation"". Chevy Chase plays Clark Griswold who takes his family on a vacation to Wally's World via a very ugly station wagon. It is a cross country trip. What was supposed to be a fun, harmless trip turns to be a living nightmare for Clark and his brood. The trip gets off on the wrong foot when Clark picks up the car at the car dealership only to find out that the car he wanted was never ordered but instead got a really ugly '70s station wagon. Everything that could go wrong on a car trip does go wrong. One of my favorite moments was when the family stops to visit his wife Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) who includes then unknown Jane Krakowski as the hilarious cousin Vicki and Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie. The trip quickly goes downhill when they Aunt Edna (Imogene Cocoa) joins the family in the car with her dog who is far from kind and gentle. For me this film was a non-stop laughs like when the family got lost in the desert. I especially loved it when Clark flirts with Christie Brinkley as she drives by in her Ferrari. I laughed even harder when the family stops at a park for a picnic lunch and Chevy sees Christie shooting a commercial nearby. Of all the ""Vacation"" movies made, nothing beats the original.",N/A

When it first heard about it, I was somewhat sceptical about the movie, thinking that it would simply be another distorted Hollywoodization of an historical event or historical period.  I subsequently read reviews that claimed that it was in fact a great movie, a cut above as it were, and that the movie was sensitive towards Japanese culture etc.  In particular what I found most interesting was the claim that the movie was not the typical Western film where Western values are proven superior--that the reverse is in fact the case here.  But still, I was sceptical, and did not concern myself with the movie until just a few days ago.  All things considered, I think I was justified in my scepticism; while there were aspects that I found to be good and commendable (the majestic landscape, quite stunning combat sequences), for the most part I just did not find it to be a good film.

When you see the characters not only speaking, but also in action, the meaning of the Scriptures becomes that much more perceivable, and hopefully much clearer.I find it odd that this movie isn't regarded as highly as Charlton Heston's Moses movie. I think it has a lot to do with subject matter (if you know what I mean), and the potential for revolutionary change, even in this age. But then, Christianity has done quite well before the invention of cinema.I saw a documentary on the making of Jesus of Nazareth. One man commented on the fact that if you watch the movie, you will notice that Jesus' eyes never blink! This was intentional, and the effect on some viewers was duly noted.The violence involved in the scourging, torture, and crucifixion of the Christ is a vital part of the Gospel. For me, I find it enough to know what Jesus had gone through, in detail. And even to watch a depiction, for me, is painful and heartbreaking. The last few hours of Jesus' life (as shown in the movie) might be too violent for children up to perhaps 13 of age. But I love how it was made. The sets and locations are gorgeous. The actors poured out the very essence of their skills in their performances.It is a very entertaining movie; uplifting, and inspirational. I'm sure it will strengthen your faith.",N/A

But every moment is tinged with the sadness of having lost a great friend, and our realization that a wonderful rock and roll personality has been removed from the world.

Leaving his mates in the lurch in the middle of a tour- John, John, John, defintely bad form at best. The pain, the sadness is evident in every closeup, between the songs, and in the music itself. Listen to Townsend's tortured guitar licks and Daltry's strangled singing and you will know this is a group of friends in deep mourning. The music though is fantastic, even though they occasionally get out of synch, particularly Zak Starkey, but it doesn't matter. Anything on this night that might be a mistake is forgiven by their fans, and at times the music soars and reaches the heights seen and heard by Who fans in years past when the sound of The Who roared like a lion in the jungle.

Hepburn and Tracy, Doris Day and Rock Hudson, Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the ""Thomas Crown Affair"" - actually, it was Pierce Brosnan's Thomas Crown performance that enticed me into renting ""Laws of Attraction."" I equally adore Rene Russo and Julianne Moore. Brosnan is tops on my list. So what could be bad? Hah! What's bad is what the actors were given to work with. The script - the narrative - what were the writers thinking? The direction is abysmal - shame on you, Peter Howitt. This film gives new meaning to the word ""fluff."" It's beyond marshmallow. When Pierce Brosnan's sex appeal is diminished and lovely Julianne Moore comes-off flat, there's something seriously wrong. And there's not a drop of chemistry between the two. I ask, sincerely, how is this possible?Yes, the plot is trite, filled with cliches, the pace is erratic, but these two actors, and the more than decent supporting cast, could have overcome all this, even slightly. No? Julianne Moore just doesn't have the right stuff to pull-off comedy. Her tone, her timing, just don't make for laughs. Now, as a serious dramatic actress, she's excellent. But, Ms. Moore, no more forays into comedy, please.Moore plays Audrey Miller, a top notch NYC divorce lawyer and Yale graduate, but a dull character. She is plagued by personal insecurities and neuroses due to a lifetime competing with her ever youthful, ever gorgeous mother, (Frances Fisher). Fellow divorce lawyer, Daniel Rafferty, (Brosnan), matches Miller case for case, and actually seems to win more than lose. A relationship is supposed to blossom here, with Audrey fighting commitment all the way. This is where chemistry, or lack of it, moves the movie into the realm of disaster.I might have appreciated ""Laws of Attraction"" more if it were truly terrible. But it is just blah.

This one looks like some famous people with digital cameras decided to shoot a movie of whatever they do best when they aren't following a script.

So great, it is almost as if the writers realized that they knew someone who could do Peter Sellers so well that they could make a movie that could have been a Peter Sellers movie back in his day.  Kevin Kline was reciting from the end of the poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot; by Matthew Arnold instead of doing an original toast, but he was old enough to seem like a relic compared to the rest of the cast, and that poem is top-notch relic material.The women in this film are so wonderful that most of my life, I was hardly aware such women existed.  Parker Posey was the one I have seen most often.  The cast information on the DVD listed movies that were worth checking for the years in which these actresses played high school girls in their previous movies. The tension between these women, now that they are old enough to really want something or someone of their own, gets worked over in a number of different ways.  After watching the movie a few times, my favorite moment was when they left the front door open and Gwyneth Paltrow walked in.  I have no idea why I have not been going to all her movies.  Pretty soon she has to apologize for gushing.  Just watching her, I feel the same way.",N/A
738673,"I shied away from seeing this movie after I read a description of what it was about. Then I read some rave reviews and overcame my initial trepidation. I know that James Spader, one of my favorite actors, often chooses odd vehicles to showcase his talents, so I decided to give the movie a chance.I am glad that I did because it was well worth viewing, in my opinion. Strange? yes. Disturbing? yes. Pornographic? no. It is a funny and oddly tender movie...a different kind of love story. But because it is different, is it wrong? I don't think so.There is a lot of emotional pain in this movie, shown brilliantly by Maggie Gyllenhaal's character, Lee (just out of a mental hospital), who goes to work for the emotionally closed-off lawyer, E. Edward Grey (Spader), a man with many fetishes, obviously an odd duck. Before long, Lee has become the object of one of these fetishes...and she finds herself excited more than she has ever been.These odd and needy characters are presented as sympathetic and we come to care about them as the movie unfolds. They establish a slowly built, fragile relationship that we may not understand, but the filmmaker does, and he portrays it in a sensitive and caring manner.",N/A
514322,"Probably the pick of the Jaws style thrillers that remerged a few years back, attempting to capture the suspense of the Shark flick, with more inventive special effects.The movie sports a pretty good cast, including Samuel L Jackson as a rich investor, and Saffron Burrows as the hard nosed and dedicated physician attempting to find a cure for Alzheimer's by using Shark brain fluid. Sounds cheesy, but the plot actually supports itself quite well and is at least plausible, if a little improbable. The story centers around an isolated marine facility with a skeleton crew that you just know are going to get into problems, and sure enough the picture moves quickly into an escape adventure, when the hunters (or scientists) become the hunted. Another complaint is the casting: the director seems to have felt the need to cover all the bases with stereotype characters, which really wasn't necessary.* The aging and unkempt heavy smoking scientist* The sexy young, ruthless bossy woman* The religious guy* The handsome hunky hero with a shady past* The successful financial investor, who's also athletic and a born leader* The soft spoken other female with an active but sensitive side* The brainy guy who's a bit of a wimp, but comes through in a clutchThis is no Jaws however, with none of the grace or depth of the Spielberg classic, and spends far too much time trying to wow the audience with the ferociousness of the initially caged lab experiments. After they get loose we are treated to some gory attack scenes but this is where the movie really suffers. Watching this on the small screen really shows up the CGI and at times the sharks looks so fake, they almost appear as cartoons. Lightning fast attack sequences don't help this either, and the whole thing starts to look very artificial.This isn't a BAD picture, and there are one or two twists in the plot, and scenes to make you jump which help lift the story in places, but it is WAY TOOOOO predictable overall.Worth a look, but you probably won't pause it while you put the popcorn on!

Well, I take that back, the main character's husband had the best mullet. But other than that, nada. Unlike the original Howling, which had awesome and unique looking werewolves, this one the werewolves are, well, wolves. No make up required. They turned into the average, everyday wolf. Didn't put a whole lot a work into that did they? This movie was a B-movie, but didn't have a lot of the GOOD B-movie elements.What I learned from Howling 4: Howling 3 is way better as a B-movie.If you liked this movie, I recomend: Banging your head against a brick wall, because for as much pain as your going to go through watching this movie, you might as well inflict it on yourself.",N/A

Strange how a 39 year old show continues to hold me enthralled with each viewing. The still impressive special effects, John William's evocative music scores and (at least for the first season)above par writing all contribute to the series' longevity. What makes Lost in Space relevant for me and, I suspect, other viewers is the wonderful sense of love and family that permeates this program.

757912,"First off, it's obvious that David Morse was just brought in to broaden Double Vision's international appeal but his presence doesn't take away from the intensity and mystery of the film. In truth, the involvement of the FBI is kind of irrelevant (you'll get a feeling it's just added upon).The real star here is Tony Leung (the other one, not the Infernal Affairs/Hero Tony Leung). His portrayal of a troubled Foreign Services officer is compelling, and his tortured performance really drives the movie.It's basically X-Files, mixed with an Eastern-style Seven and a temple massacre that predated Kill Bill, Double Vision is an enjoyable thriller with moody cinematography and excellent production values.The deliberate pacing is perfect for this type of genre. It builds up the creepiness factor, while fully realizing the conflicts of Tony Leung's character.Although the end is not as tight as the first 3/4s of the movie, Double Vision is a thriller worthy of purchase.",Double Vision
148766,"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a funny movie that benefits greatly from the performances of its two main stars.  Freddy Benson is a loud, crass American con man traveling through Europe by conning women out of money.  Lawrence Jamieson is a suave, mannerly con man who has already established himself in the con business.  The two meet up and at first are unwilling allies, but things go south quickly.  In a duel of the cons, the two men see who can get $50,000 from a rich American heiress first.  The loser has to leave town.  The duel between Martin and Caine is the best part of the movie as they try to outdue each other.  This isn't your usual Steve Martin but Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is still worth a watch.Steve Martin and Michael Caine are great together as dueling con-men, Freddy Benson and Lawrence Jamieson.  Martin's physical humor and Caine's dry humor work very well together.  Glenne Headly plays Janet Colgate, the heiress they are trying to con the money out of.

839382,"Heck, VAN HELSING is lots of fun and that's what makes this movie so entertaining for me.  Sure, it's overbrimming with special effects, but they're so cool and well done, I never tired of them, even a few of which were a little over the top.  Director Stephen Sommers who brought us the delightfully campy MUMMY series gives us a riproaring, action packed adventure story, and even though it's camp and humor is not quite as on target as in the Mummy movies, there is still plenty of tongue in cheek humor to soften the monstrous savagery.Hugh Jackman (who would make a good James Bond) stars as the enigmatic Van Helsing, not your typical Peter Cushing Van Helsing, but a strange man who has a clouded past.  Jackman does well in the role, infusing the requisite macho and spiritual qualities.  David Wenham as Carl is wonderful in his low-key, restrained performance.  Wenham, who also appeared in LORD OF THE RINGS, is a capable supporting actor and was fun to watch.  Kate Beckinsale is certainly beautiful, but I've never been overly impressed with her acting abilities, but she makes a nice heroine.  Richard Roxburgh as Dracula is a little too effeminate at times, but he is certainly a snarly vampire.  Kevin J. O'Connor behind great make-up plays Igor with a humorous flair.  Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster overcomes his overwrought makeup to portray the man-made ""monster"" who wants to be accepted.Alan Silvestri's score is appropriately melodramatic and the visuals, cinematography and art direction are Oscar worthy, as are the effects.Critics generally hated this movie, Newsweek's David Ansen placed it in his ten most disappointing movies of the year.

388429,"&quot;Amityville II: The Possession&quot; is essentially a prequel to &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; in that it tells why the home in the Long Island community was available for sale for that the Lutz family could move in and end up running fleeing for their lives.  This time it is the Montelli family that moves into the accursed house, which is not good because they are an unhappy family in the grand tradition of Tolstoy that is heading for trouble no matter where they live.  The main tension is between the father, Anthony (Burt Young), and his eldest song, Sonny (Jack Magner), and if it were not for the fact that anyone who saw the original movie knows what is going to happen at the end of this one, you might be wondering which one of these guys is going to lose it first.Surprisingly, this 1982 film goes through a lot of the same things as the original, which is not surprising for a sequel but more so because there was never a notion that every time somebody moves into this house rooms are covered with flies, blood comes out in strange places, and unseen presences are running around making people feel uneasy.  In another move that makes sense only in terms of the movies rather than the &quot;history&quot; of the house, the unseen beings start covering the walls of the children's bedroom with evil pictures and phrases.  At this point the film convinces you that there is something really evil in that house, and it would be Anthony Montelli.  Even when the local priest (James Olson) comes by to bless the house and sees Anthony going after his family, he walks away (which would seem to be good advice with regards to this film).On some levels this film is better than the original, but only in the sense that if there never had been an original this one might work better.  The flaw with the film version of &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; was that whereas the novel told a &quot;true&quot; story in a rather documentary style, which was abandoned for cheesy horror film effects.  The simple idea of possession that was implied to be the reason the son went off one night and killed his family is now adorned with a whole host of tacky &quot;Exorcist&quot; like ideas.  The irony, as I understand it, is that the killing of this family was the one bit of the hoax that really was true.  The names are changed because this film would have been the target for a lawsuit otherwise. If director Damiano Damiani had stuck to the true story and forgot about all this other nonsense he would have had a better film.  In fact, the only part of &quot;Amityville II: The Possession&quot; that really works is the night of the murders.",Amityville II: The Possession VHS

774231,"Xavier, the young man whose story this is, often has a look of pure delight on his face as he observes and participates in the lives and loves of his house-mates, a mixed international and every-shifting bag of young students who somehow manage to live together in a messy communal apartment in Barcelona. His look is of unadulterated love and appreciation of their diversity, their quirks, their secrets - and that's exactly, I believe, the look my husband and I had on our faces as we watched this movie last night. Yeah, it was New Year's Eve, but we never go to parties; we stay home and watch movies and do our own thing. L'Augerge Espagnole was wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. The BEST way to bring in the new year.I guess you'd call this a coming-of-age piece. It captures vignettes in the interrelated lives of these young people and a couple of others on the fringe, notably a neurosurgeon and his new shy wife, whom Xavier met on the plane. One of the best scenes is when his lesbian housemate instructs him about the seduction of women - graphically - so he can go about making his move on the shy wife. It works, and it's wonderfully done. Another great scene is when ALL the students mobilize to prevent Wendy's boyfriend (she's the Brit) from discovering that she's having herself a fling with an American; her doofus kid brother is the one who comes thru by shoving Wendy under the bed and, bare-chested, taking her place in bed beside the very confused American - well, you have to see it to appreciate it fully. Audrey Tautou is here, too (remember? The girl from Amelie?), as his unhappy girlfriend left behind in Paris. He describes her perfectly: She's a mess. Then he uses the same words to describe himself - and of course, both are correct. But who cares?

Instead, I was won over by a good storyline, terrific voice acting, and superb art throughout.

64631,"I grew up knowing about Doris Day because my mother was/is a big fan of her comedies.  When I first saw ""Pillow Talk"" I was a mere child (the film was made the same year I was born).  Over the years I have watched it frequently, and now have it also on DVD.  The film continues to entertain and delight me, even as my impressions have changed with time.Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Tony Randall had a wonderfully delightful chemistry amongst them!  From the opening where Doris is humming ""Pillow Talk"" after the intro is completed, to the far-fetched but humourous end when Brad Allen (Rock) is trying to tell his friend Jonathan that he is going to be a father, the film is simply splendidly performed throughout!  Credit must also be given to the script writers Stanley Shapiro & Maurice Richlin, director Michael Gordon & Producer Ross Hunter.Even though I was born the year ""Pillow Talk"" was made, I didn't even know party lines existed until I visited a great-aunt in Northern Minnesota.  I remember picking up the phone and hearing people talk.  WHAT A DISCOVERY!  It put the film in a new context for me when I saw it later (I am not sure if I had seen it before).  I suspect that the younger generation might not understand even the notion of party lines in our age of cellular phones and internet.  In this regard, the film takes us back to a less techonologically advanced time, but a time where life seemed somehow more relaxed.I delight in seeing New York City, Central Park, and the American automobiles in the 1959 frame of context.  One question that pops into my mind:  did people in NYC really have such big apartments with a single woman living alone, and still affording a maid to come in each day??? Was the maid really paid enough to make a living from it?  Did NYC really have that sort of ""everyone knows everyone"" feel such as when Kelly the police officer congratulates Brad Allen as he carries Jan Morrow from her apartment to his?  I doubt it, but the fantasy is lovely!Rock Hudson did a really fun impression of a Texan rancher up in New York.  Tony Randall was extremely funny as the self-deprecating multi-millionaire in love with Jan, and Doris simply glowed from beginning to end.  The last few times I have watched it, which has been recently, I have been struck by the sexual frankness it explored.  Brad the playboy, always luring in the beautiful women, Jan the wonderfully moral interior decorator, who shakes her tush in a very sexy manner at a nightclub when Brad first spots her, and the budding romance that develops between the two when he becomes ""Rex Stetson"", a cowboy from Texas.  ""Rex"" playing the moral companion who would do nothing to offend the proper Miss Morrow, while inside he is sizing her up and biting at the bit to ... well bite at her bits?  When the gig is almost up, ""Rex"" innocently suggests that Jan join him for a weekend in Connecticut.  While there was no actual sex occuring, it is made clear that it was about to happen when Jan figures out the ruse Brad Allen has played on her.  Hollywood, perhaps afraid of the extent of this sexual frankness, has Miss Morrow crying at the diner where she and Jonathan stop for coffee, saying ""I thought we were going to get married."" Good girl image preserved!Later, when Brad Allen conspires with Jan's boss to have her redecorate his apartment, the scene of the music beginning to play and the double bed automatically folding out with sheets in place left no doubt what sort of life Brad led prior to falling in love with Jan.  He was a playboy through and through and measured success by the quantity of women he successfully ""entertained"" at home.  Growing up believing that promiscuous sexuality was a by-product of the late 60's counter culture movement and ""summer of love"", it struck me how direct and unambigious this scene was.  However, in a very moral and virginal way, Jan's virtues are protected until she hears that Brad wants to marry her and in fact, loves her very deeply.I am particularly fond of stories where romance changes a person for the good.  Being an adult and a male, however, I wonder if such a womanizing playboy could and would remain ever faithful to the woman he loves for all eternity and never feel the need to stray again.  It is fun, however, to believe that love was the true redemptor and that Brad and Jan lived happily ever after.  Isn't this the great promise of romance AND fairy tales.In both genres, Pillow Talk succeeds beyond measure and I love it more each time I see it.P.S.  The music is great too.  Love ""Roly Poly"", ""Possess Me"" and of course, the theme song!",N/A

Zero character introduction/development.  Pure process.  Despite all this precision planning and execution, the heist relies on a hot young woman's willingness to be ravished by another hot young woman in a public toilet stall.I could've admired the ingenuity of the caper if it didn't revolve around a Dear Forum letter from Penthouse magazine.But, then again, the girls were hot and I doubt that I would've stayed as interested--so there you go.Anotonio Banderas looks like a character from another film who's stumbled in while trying to figure out where he's supposed to go.  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is really trying to get a film career going but this role could've just as easily been played by Shannon Tweed or Tanya Roberts.The story goes through some serious contortions to reach its point, which I liked, but it felt odd: a sexy thriller with a sentimental fable-like ending.I watch DePalma films but I usually end up feeling the same way about all of them: stylistically interesting (if derivitive), unsympathetic characters, slow-motion at the worst time, complicated stories/sequences--but watchable and more interesting than most of the lame thrillers put out by studios.",N/A
785081,"""Underworld"" is fun to watch, but it's really nothing more than an average sci-fi/action flick.  One thing is for sure, this movie is in no way a horror film.  Take any standard action yarn, replace the good guys with vampires and the bad guys with werewolves.  Next, throw in a twist that bonds one of the goodies and baddies together.  Finally, blend in a betrayal and a cover-up and you basically have the storyline.  There's nothing new here.The two supernatural enemies really don't even use their powers against each other that much.  The ""death dealer"" vampires have more guns than a cult in Waco.  They don't even get close to ripping open the necks of their enemies. The werewolves, for the most part, are happy reliving scenes from ""Fight Club"" in the city's subway tunnels.Don't think that this flick isn't enjoyable, though.  It is visually fun to watch and the action is pretty good.  I just wish that the vamps and wolves could have used their powers a little more than their guns.  The betrayal and cover-up mentioned earlier does actually make you pull for one side of the conflict a little more than the other, but in the end, you just want to see these folks beat the heck out of each other until someone yells, ""Uncle!""If you want real vampire or werewolf action, check out a movie like ""Interview With The Vampire""(better yet, read the book), or ""Silver Bullet""(again, the book is better).

616554,"The interesting thing I noticed about the reviews for this movie is that every review literally has a completely different opinion of it, regardless of how they rated it. Basically, I liked the original American Pie, and I thought American Pie 2 was even better. THIS movie was okay, but I think only people that are really, REALLY into the first two movies can appreciate it.Jim has been dating Michelle for years, and he finally asks her for her hand in marriage, which she accepts. Eventually, Stifler decides to throw Jim a bachelor party, along with Jim's usual friends Kevin, Finch, and Oz -- wait, Oz isn't there. He wasn't even mentioned in the whole movie! What's up with that?I read somewhere that someone said this movie should have been called The Steve Stifler Show. I totally see where that reviewer is coming from (especially since Seann William Scott got higher billing than Alyson Hannigan). Yeah, Stifler WAS the funniest character in the first two movies, but in comparing those movies to THIS one, it seems like the antics and situations he was in have gone from funny and dumb to just dumb -- well, during the first half of the movie, anyway. And you have to admit that the scene in the gay bar wasn't 100% necessary.To me, the only character that was completely funny throughout the whole movie was Jim's dad (I have yet to see Eugene Levy on screen when he isn't extremely funny). The DVD extras weren't all that, either (but are they ever?) The ""Enter the Dominatrix"" thing was really kind of pointless, and  the ""Stifler Speak"" segment (starring...who else?) really makes you start to wonder just whose movie this is. All in all, though, while not a total waste of time, I'm glad I only rented this movie. But if you already own the other two movies, you might as well add this one to your collection. American Wedding really helped make 2002 the year of Sequels That Nobody Went to See along with Legally Blonde 2 and Analyze That.Anthony RupertP.S.

I haven't read any reviews, and I've avoided hearing anything about it -- I don't want anything to spoil the surprise. I've closed my eyes and copied/pasted any comments I've stumbled upon into one big document so I can go back after I've seen the movie, to read what other big &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; fans have to say!I'm giggling in anticipation of seeing Jason Voorhees tear his way through New York City for at least 90 minutes of carnage!More than a decade years ago, I was coerced into attending a screening of &quot;Star Trek V: the Final Frontier.&quot; Before that film began, the theater dimmed to blackness. A trailer began. The screen blazed with the Manhattan skyline at night; the speakers pulsed with the melody of Frank Sinatra's famous song. The camera panned left, fixing on the back of a lone figure gazing at Gotham's towering lights. Closer...closer the frame crept to the onlooker until * GASP! * he whipped around to reveal the famous battered hockey mask that haunts us all. Screams and cheers filled the theater; it was a magically horrifying moment.I also remember the fabled &quot;I [heart] NY&quot; version of the movie's poster, with Jason ripping through. Legal issues forced the recall of that brilliant marketing design, sadly lost to the mists of time.Thanks to a strict Creationist upbringing, I was never allowed to fulfill my desperate wish to see &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot; in a movie theater, and my rigorous home-schooling prevented me from obtaining a home-video version before this day.However, the release of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; spurred me to seek out the temptations of my adolescence.Finally, I'm on the verge of laying all my daydreams and speculation to rest. I can only imagine the hundreds of creative ways the filmmakers will utilize Jason's skill for slaughter in an ultra-urban setting. Subway cars, manhole covers, skyscraper spires, hot dog carts...these are things nightmares are made of! Whether they're used BY Jason or AGAINST him, the trappings of a big city can be used to terrible effect on the human (or inhuman) body. There's no way such potential can fail to re-invigorate the sagging &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; films.I'm also hoping for a cute Central Park reference to Jason's habit of stalking people through woods--that would be a clever nod to the series' tradition.Plus, thanks to my connections in the NYC Sanitation Department, I know for a fact that Manhattan's sewers are flooded with toxic waste every night. I'm sure this is a detail the writers will have worked into the screenplay somehow.But I'm MOST excited to learn exactly HOW Jason makes it to the Big Apple (though I hope they don't spend too much time on the issue). I'm not positive exactly where Crystal Lake is supposed to be located, but with Jason's thirst for depravity and sin, it's not hard to believe he would home in on New York City like a beacon. Perhaps a multi-state-long trail of corpses simply traces his path across the Hudson River.And just think of the possible body-count! In the past, Jason has been limited to a small number of victims (per movie) who happen across his neck of the woods. But with the throngs of people who inhabit New York, I'm sure there will hardly be time for dialogue in this film!Some might say I'm setting my hopes too high. I scoff -- how could a reputable film studio like Paramount Pictures ever fail to make the most of the wealth of ideas presented by placing one of their most iconic horror properties in a completely new environment? Jason Voorhees + New York City = can't miss hit!Best of all, thanks to the magic of DVD, I'll be able to revisit that trailer...the one that, for me, started it all!There's no way I'll be disappointed!",N/A
686306,"First, let me say that I don't bow at the altar of Sondheim. I find some of his songs incredibly beautiful and others witty but less melodically enjoyable. So, why five stars for this revue? Because the performers are exceptional.I honestly feel this is Carol Burnett's best performance. I used to believe that it was practically impossible for her to sing seriously, with sincere emotion. It always seemed that she simply placed a serious veneer over her comic persona. But the years have given her the emotional depth to be able to carry off the challenging dramatic weight of the songs she's handed here. Her subtle and well-sung interpretations of &quot;Every Day a Little Death&quot; and &quot;Could I Leave You&quot; hold up against any others.But that's not all. Let me give equally enthusiastic praise to the two younger performers, John Barrowman and Ruthie Henshall. They are, as others have said here, simply spectacular. They've got it all -- great voices, talent, looks. Both deserve shows of their own.This DVD is not to be missed. Add it to your collection before it goes out of print.",Stephen Sondheim's Putting It Together - A Musical Review
346198,"Escape from Fort Bravo is a very good western that deals with a time and place not often featured in westerns.  Fort Bravo is a Union outpost in the Arizona territory during the Civil War.  Colonel Owens, Captain Roper, and a company of Union cavalry must watch over the stockade full of Confederate officers while also dealing with the Mescalero Apaches.  When four of the prisoners escape with a woman from the fort, Captain Roper and a small detail must chase them across the barren desert as the Apaches close in on them.  This is a very good western from director John Sturges(The Magnificent Seven).  It is a beautifully shot movie with a good score by Jeff Alexander and Stan Jones.  While the first part of the movie is good, the climax is the best part.  Stranded in the desert by the Mescaleros, the Union and Confederate troops must try and survive as arrows rain down on them.  It is a great ending that should not be missed.William Holden gives a typically good performance as the ruthless Captain Roper, who must try and bring the escaped prisoners back to Fort Bravo.  Eleanor Parker is also very good as Carla Forester, a woman who comes to the fort with alterior motives but begins to fall for Roper.  John Forsythe, William Demarest, and William Campbell play three of the escaped prisoners, Marsh, Campbell, and Young.  The trio brings a humor to their parts that is otherwise missing in the movie.  The movie also stars Polly Bergen, Richard Anderson as Lt. Beecher, the voice of reason, Carl Benton Reid as Colonel Owens, and John Lupton as Bailey.  The VHS is of average quality, but the movie is well worth a watch.  For a highly entertaing western with a great final showdown, check out Escape from Fort Bravo!",N/A
730912,"I read The Rules of Attraction years ago when it was first released in the 80s (I still have my dog-eared hardback copy).  It has remained one of my all time favorite novels. The resonations from that novel have stayed with me, changing my perspective on what writing can be and making me an instant Bret Easton Ellis fan. I was in college at the time I first read it and it seemed to be a frighteningly accurate portrayal of the excesses of 80s college life.  So imagine my dismay when I discovered that it was adapted for film.  Less Than Zero was a disappointing flop, the original story practically unrecognizable in its film adaptation and American Psycho was a fairly well-done interpretation of Ellis's difficult novel.  So I had no hopes for The Rules of Attraction.  Finally, months after its release on DVD, I decided to give it a go.Although it isn't a truly faithful adaptation, Avary manages to capture the essence of the novel brilliantly taking some liberties with the storyline and characters (i.e. Lauren was NOT a virgin and did not go to the opening party, Sean and Paul had a fairly extended sexual relationship although Sean was too drunk or high to remember most of it).  Through the use of a cinematic bag of tricks, an alienating soundtrack by tomandandy peppered with 80s hits and a cast of beautiful 20-something actors (Shannyn Sossamon is gorgeous!) Avary creates the same atmosphere of detached disaffectedness with a sense of urgency as the novel.  My favorite cinematic devise used is running the film backwards.  I liked the opening party scene which really is the end of the movie and how each character and their perspective is introduced by running the scene backwards three times.  Also, the use of character voiceovers helps to convey a sense of hopelessness as a lot of the voiceover dialogue is lifted directly from the novel.  The movie even opens and closes in a mid sentence dialogue like the novel.  Watching this movie (and reading the novel as well) creates a sense that something is wrong, but what?  The scary thing is in 1987 this novel was spot on in its portrayal of jaded 80s youth.  I don't think, in 2004, it's too far off the mark in relation to today's youth as well.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, more so than I thought I would. I was mesmerized with every stunning, shocking and stylized scene.  One of the best book-to-movie adaptations I've seen in a long time.  Definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you really enjoyed the movie then pick up the book.  If you really enjoyed the book, I doubt you'll be disappointed with the movie. Brilliant.",The Rules of Attraction VHS
850152,"This PBS presentation beautifully lays out contrasting views (theism/atheism)... yet somehow never comes off as advocating either one; letting the viewer decide.

I found myself pausing this DVD over and over again as I wrote down my own thoughts and, yes, my own spontaneous revelations.  It's that sort of program.  It makes you want to grab a notebook and a pencil.I won't tell you which way I lean (Freud? Lewis?)... but I will say BUY THIS!  SEE IT!

629926,"I was against 'Bush's War' from the beginning.  Like Michael Moore, I was criticized as unpatriotic and unsupportive of the troops (even though I served in the US Army from 1978-1984).  I had seen much of the information presented in the film previously, though from separate sources such as books and newspaper articles.  What Moore has done with 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is bring all the various facts concerning the Bush administration's misadventures all together in one controversial film.No one should kid themselves-Michael Moore is a partisan ,and is firmly against what George Bush and his cronies represent. He fully expected - and welcomed - the firestorm of criticism his film generated. The irony is that as time goes by, more and more of what is presented in 'Fahrenheit' is being confirmed by former members of the Bush administration, arms inspectors in the Iraq invasion aftermath, and even by Bush and Cheney themselves!  Even powerful members of Bush's own Republican Party are now condemning the mess that the Iraq 'liberation' has become.I was enraged by what I saw in this movie.  How could so many Americans be so blind (and a large proportion of the population STILL refuses to see the truth)?  How could our media function as a cheerleading section for what was happening?  If nothing else, this film is a call to all Americans to vote to change the direction our country is now headed (or at minimum, at least express SOME kind of opinion by going to the ballot box).If you haven't yet done so, see this film.  Formulate your opinion not just on what you see from it, but look at other sources.  Then VOTE your conscience either way, but please vote!The thousands who have died and shed blood defending your right to do so cry out against complacency, especially in the year 2004!",Fahrenheit 9/11
247966,"I cannot recall a time when I did not love this hilarious movie, which is my favourite from the 1980's by far. The superb Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in ""Big Business"",that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from Hollywood's Golden Age. A total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory. The premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in ""Big Business"", it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble Jupitor Hollow to the height of New York's business world.The story begins in a flash back when wealthy New Yorkers Hunt and Binky Shelton are passing through rural backwater Jupitor Hollow when Binky goes into labour. At the same time locals Garth and Iona Ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of Sadie and Rose but are also mixed up. We move forward forty years to where Sadie Shelton is the corporate head of Moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of Holomade, the local industry in Jupitor Hollow. Getting wind of their plans the militant Jupitor Hollow resident Rose Ratliff decides to go fight these ""Pinstriped Trouser Snakes"", on their own territory and Sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring Jupitor Hollow. Through a mix up they end up staying in the Plaza Hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as ""sinks in the living room"", and ""soaps in the shapes of swans""! Complication piles on top of complication as Sadie Shelton's ex husband Michael (Barry Primus), can't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural Sadie for his hard nosed wife and Jay Marshall(Michael Gross), can't for the life of him understand why Rose (Ratliff) is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure Rose (Shelton). All comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two Sadie's are really the city Sheltons while the two Rose's are really the twins meant to be in Jupitor Hollow. The fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when Sadie (Shelton), is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to Sadie (Ratliff), to put all her watching of her idol Alexis Carrington in ""Dynasty"", to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing Jupitor Hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully.Classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins, on the classic 1960's comedy series ""The Patty Duke Show"". I dont think I've ever seen Bette Midler in finer form than in ""Big Business"". Her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails Sadie Shelton who's all ""hostile takeovers"" to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin Sadie Ratliff who only wants to be able to say ""keep the change!"" is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter. Her classic mirror sequence with her ""twin"", is a total riot and her statement that ""this whole thing has got UFO written all over it!"",will have you breaking up with laughter. Equally Lily Tomlin as both country activist Rose Ratcliff, ""I'm gonna go kick some snooty New York Ass!"", and as Rose Shelton the awkward out of place city girl ""I hate shopping and I hate New York in June!"",is also top rate. Her rejection of Jay's engagement ring as a supposed ""bribe"" and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a ""great big belly scraping pile of cow plop!"", is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene I never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening I have of this movie. Of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at New York's Plaza Hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up. Two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk's (Joe Grifasi), continual mixing up of Sadie Shelton/Ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined, and especially Fabio Alberici's (Michele Placido), total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers, the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone! The hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women (one from the country and the other from the city), seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff. It is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first. Classics like: ""Im gonna dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease!"",""Oh my God it's so COSMOpolitan"", ""Oh sure its full of crowds, smog, sex fiends, and white slavers, it's a pistol, I've got about as much use for it (New York), as a Toad has for spit pearls!"", ""Computer chips, they've got their ways!"", and ""Have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase?"", are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script.Total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more. It is a real pity that ""Big Business"", so far has marked the only time that Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle. This film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages. I've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as I am! So I'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you haven't already. You wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends, in Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in ""Big Business"". Enjoy!",Big Business VHS
786516,"Probably the most hyped backwoods horror flick of 2003, Cabin Fever received early marks from many critics as a great return to 80's style horror. Lion's Gate Films was the lucky studio that got its hands on the picture for distribution, but upon wide release, seemingly most horror fans who saw it proclaimed it one of the worst films of the year. Kinda makes you question if pre-release hype is the slightest bit reliable (I remember people talking about how terrible the script for the Dawn of the Dead remake was, but it turned out to be the best horror film since The Ring).Sporting an opening not too dissimilar from The Evil Dead, Cabin Fever begins with five teens going on a trip to the woods for a weekend of fun and relaxation. Among the teens are nice guy Paul (Rider Strong), who's desperate to sleep with his best friend Karen (Jordan Ladd), horny couple Jeff and Marcy (Joey Kern and Cerina Vincent), and goofball Bert (James DeBello), who gets on everyone else's nerves on so many occasions, I wondered why the others bothered to bring him along.They reach their cabin with little problem and everything goes well at first; Jeff and Marcy fornicate without abandon, Karen kisses Paul for the first time, and Bert is having fun shooting at the small local wildlife. But the arrival of a sick man infected with a skin-eating disease at their door one night leads to total disaster, he vomits blood all over their car, which gets trashed, and runs off burning when Paul jabs him with a ""torch."" Thinking their immediate problems are over, the teens just want to get a mechanic to fix their car, but an even worse problem arises, the flesh-eating bacteria has somehow passed on to one of them, resulting in paranoia and disease that will lead to a literal bloodbath.Cabin Fever is a film where one gets the distinct impression that the writer/director is truly an enthusiastic horror fan that wants to pay homage to as many genre classics as possible, while also carving this film its own niche as a scary, funny gorefest. And certainly, director Eli Roth gets much of the film right and has a strong handle when it comes to pacing and dreadful anticipation.CF is already effective merely because of its premise; the fear of hideous bodily horror is something that probably spooks most of us, I know it has that effect on me. For the most part, Roth plays this for all its worth, we get numerous scenes of the teens trying to avoid touching others who are infected, and lots of scenes of victims vomiting blood and peeling flesh. Disgusting, but undeniably eye-catching and hard to turn away from.Roth also smartly develops the characters first, which has been a surprisingly growing trend recently (Wrong Turn and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake also attempted to flesh out their characters first). This is not to say we've got full-on, three-dimensional characterizations at work here, but the protagonists are generally likeable, particularly Rider Strong and Jordan Ladd. Hottie Cerina Vincent has the unenviable task of playing the [promiscuous woman], but the role is played with more intelligece than usual, and it's great to see nudity in a time when most slashers shy away from bare flesh (it's too bad one of Cerina's nude scenes is during a particularly uncomfortable moment).But Cabin Fever is marred with astoundingly idiotic scenes and plot twists and turns. The initial set-up, that of the teens having to deal with the disease, is a great one. But throwing in gun-toting rednecks and a weird kid obsessed with biting people was a bad move. The only logical reason I figure Roth included the backwoods folks was to give the movie a higher bodycount and throw in more opportunities for gruesome mayhem. Sure, the violence is pretty hypnotic in a ""wow, I can't believe I just saw that"" way that most mainstream big-studio films try to stray away from, but it comes at too much of a cost to the film's initially solid premise.The whole mess in the film occurs because the sick hermit went to the teens for help. Then we later find out he's actually the cousin of a nearby meat factory worker. Why didn't he just go to her for help instead, especially considering she's already aware of a disease being passed around to the wildlife and is likely familiar with the whereabouts of the local hospital. There are also questions involving who got infected when, but there's enough context clues that it's not particularly bothersome that we don't see the exact moment of infection. We just never find out where the disease originated from, not that it really matters.Roth's attempts at morbid laughs range from rock solid (the bowling story) to just eye-rollingly ridiculous (Paul's constant mishaps, whether it's a ladder that breaks, murderous rednecks, a dangerous dog, a deer conveniently in the middle of the road, and the local police force). In fact, I'm not even sure if Roth meant for the latter half of the film to even be taken seriously. When you've got a kid with a mullet yelling ""pancakes!"" and performing half-assed martial arts moves in slow motion, you know something has seriously gone wrong.Even that doesn't compare to the terrible final scenes, which actually features creepy music accompanying a scene that I think Roth wanted for us to expect another bloody surprise, then suddenly segues into rap music that then abruptly switches to banjo music. I can only say, what the hell? The constant switch of music is bad enough, the scene it goes with is actually even worse.But for all the mistakes the second half makes, I still had a pretty good time. Cabin Fever is never boring, a rarity in horror these days, and it avoids some cliches that I would have expected in a bigger budget slasher (though given the direction this film takes, I might actually have preferred some of those cliches). Great score by Angelo Badalamenti, too, no surprise there.",Cabin Fever
486701,"The idea of a man falling in love with a woman, who has received the heart of his late wife in a transplant operation, is a story fraught with peril.  One of the most wrenchingly emotional scenes I have ever seen on television was on ""St. Elsewhere"" where Jack Morrison (David Morse) listened to the heart of his wife beating in the body of another woman.  So how ""Return to Me"" gets to that moment when Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) listens to the heart of his late wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), beating in Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver) is, at least for me, a delicate matter.  Fortunately, this romantic comedy has Bonnie Hunt, not only playing Grace's best friend, Megan Dayton, but also as the director and the screenwriter, along with Don Lake.  That means there are some brains to go along with ample heart in this romantic comedy from 2000.""Return to Me"" begins by going back and forth between the two characters in Chicago whose lives and love will collide.  Bob is an architect and one of his planned projects is to create a new living space for the gorillas at the Lincoln Park Zoo where Elizabeth has been raising money for the effort.  Meanwhile, Grace is in the hospital waiting for a heart and being visited by her grandfather, Marty O'Reilly (Carroll O'Connor), and her friend, Megan.  On the night that a dinner is held to celebrate having raised enough money for the zoo project, there is an accident.  We know that Elizabeth's heart is intended for Grace, so Hunt does not bother to play out everything.  We do not see the accident because it is a necessary evil to the story, where the consequences matter much more than needlessly witnessing the event.  Instead the preparations for the operation take place in contrast to Bob giving way to grief at the loss of the woman he loves.  But something sweet happens: once Elizabeth's heart starts beating again, Bob finally finds enough peace to fall asleep.We then come to the most delicate part of the story: how Bob and Grace will meet.  There is an unspoken sense of magic behind what happens in this film, which would explain why it is that Bob and Grace first pass each other at the Monkey House at the Zoo.  There is no meeting, but significantly enough Grace pauses because her heart has started to beat more rapidly.  This is a good sign, and an even better one comes when he is persuaded by a friend, Charlie Johnson (David Alan Grier), to O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant.  Grace works as a waitress in her grandfather's place, where the cooking is done by Angelo Pardipillo (Robert Loggia), and the ongoing debates are over the relative value of Irish (Bing Crosby) versus Italian (Dean Martin) singers.  Bob's date is just not a nice person and when Grace flings back a zinger at her rude condescension, Bob is interested.The rest of the movie obviously consists of tentative romance, where hand holding is more important than sex, and with the full understanding that at the point where they are happiest the truth will come out and have to be dealt with.  At that point we get the movie's best line, ""What was God thinking?""  The line is so great because it is not only funny but it speaks to the film's persistent notion that there is a greater power at work here, even if it turns out to be simply love and not a mischievous deity.  My only complaint, such as it is, would be that ""Return to Me"" fails to come up with a payoff at the end as good as the setup.  Then again, the ending is predictable according to the formula, so it is hard to really come up with a great ""how"" under those circumstances.  But the film is certainly sweet enough for you to weep at the right moments and even if you do not end up crying your eyes out, this is still a laudable effort.Hunt and Lake also get credit for giving the supporting cast some great bits that justify their showing up.  In addition to O'Connor and Loggia having fun at the Irish Italian restaurant, there are Eddie Jones, Marianne Muellerleile, and William Bronder to add zest to the spicy exchanges.  There is only one deleted scene on this DVD, but it is this quintet singing ""Danny Boy,"" and then debating the song.  Jim Belushi plays Joe Dayton and joins with Hunt in double-teaming everybody else in stealing scenes.  Duchovny and Driver are the only ones required to carry heavy emotional baggage and they acquit themselves well in that regard, but the one who really shines is O'Connor as the warm but understated grandfather.  There was no doubt when the moment came for him to say the right thing to the right person at the right time, that he was going to deliver.  The same can be said for Bonnie Hunt's film.",N/A

786704,"Based on Peter Driscoll's 1972 novel, this film is set in apartheid 1970-ish South Africa during the origins of anti-apartheid groups like the Black Congress movement, seeking to overthrow  the government to achieve self-determination for the country's 18 million blacks (versus 3 million ruling whites).One always has to wonder about films where the viewpoint is so one-sided with few shades of grey.  This film treads a fine line indeed between politically correct propaganda and a wheels-within-wheels conspiracy thriller.  This reviewer's initial fears that the propaganda element would overwhelm other considerations diminished when the plot took some unexpected twists and ended with a flourish.Sidney Poitier is moderately successful in his characterization of a black who has been subdued and imprisoned by the contemptuous and repressive apartheid regime.  Years of forced subservience (and his survival of them) have made his external persona almost stoic.  Yet behind this apparent stoicism, he seethes with hatred and works for the total destruction of the apartheid system.  Opening the film, the authorities mysteriously release him from prison.  The mystery compounds when the authorities fail to re-arrest him despite any number of infractions (trumped-up or otherwise), choosing rather to follow him.A young Michael Caine plays - Michael Caine, dragged in by accident for the ride and implicated by events.  The other performances are routine excepting Major Horn (Nicol Williamson) and his side-kick Van Heerden (Ryl De Gooyer), as the arrogant, menacing and sadistic pursuing agents from the Bureau of State Security.  These two never miss an opportunity to threaten and denigrate those who either cross their path or try to frustrate their curious agenda.  Despite their limited screen time, Wiliamson and De Gooyer nevertheless bring something extra to their portrayals.The original 1974 cinematography was apparently quite good, as the (Kenya) scenery is beautiful.  The DVD picture is sufficient for enjoying the film; but purists will notice that it is fuzzy and the colors are washed out, so no re-mastering or other significant picture restoration was attempted.  Sound is in the same category.  The DVD keep case is fine.  Be advised the film is mostly for Caine or Poitier collectors.  For others it is little more than a couple hours' entertainment.",N/A

348114,"I had no idea what to expect before watching this film.  I purposefully kept myself ignorant of it because I wanted to experience it as fresh as possible.  All I knew was that, for years, it has consistently placed second on the Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films of all time (Citizen Kane always comes in first).  Now, knowing that a film is considered one of the greatest of all time sometimes means that you are in for a snore.  There are some so-called ""classics"" that just bore me to tears (The Conformist or L'Aventura spring to mind).Yes, this is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Yes, it is a satire on aristocratic society at the time.  Yes, it was badly received and banned by the Nazis.  Blah, blah, blah - who cares?  The amazing thing is what a joy this movie is to watch.  It is genuinely funny.  I often hear it cited as the main influence on Robert Altman, and now I can understand why.  Instead of criticizing Paul Thomas Anderson for copying Altman, we should appreciate Altman imitating Renoir.  Here we see the big cast without any real central character, the anarchic humor, and the brisk energy that moves everything along.Like everything in the Criterion Collection, this print LOOKS VERY GOOD.  This is all the more important since the original negative had been destroyed in World War II and for years only second-rate prints were available.  There is a second disc that documents all the travails that this film went through, and how it was edited to several different versions.  The version we have now was restored in the fifties outside (but with the blessing of) Renoir.  This print is 98 minutes long.  The original was 91 minutes, and we are still missing an unimportant scene from that original version.  I would have liked to have had a new documentary with more commentary from contemporary filmmakers (especially Altman who admits that he learned ""the rules of the game from The Rules of the Game"").

Two horribly failed attempts to animate the story (both failed so miserably the funding was pulled before they could be completed) proved the work was too big, too complicated and too adored by readers to be translated less than perfectly. On top of that Tolkien created this thick, complex world and languages that could not easily be shown or translated to the screen.But Peter Jackson did it.From the grand opening shots of the Shire, to the showdown with the Balrog, this is a moving, stirring, emotional spectacle. A masterpiece.The episodic first installment covers the handing over of the one ring from Hobbit Bilbo to nephew Frodo, neither of whom know the rings powers or origin. A dark force, Sauron, who forged the ring of power to control the lords and kings of Man, Elves and Dwarves. Existing only as a powerful spirit, a great fiery eye, Sauron searches tirelessly for the ring that can bring him back to form and power. When Wizard Gandalf figures out the nature of the ring (in an abiding Duh! moment) he hurries Frodo - who is quickly joined by fellow hobbits Merry, Pippin and loyal servant Samwise - away from the shire so that Gandalf can figure what the enemy is up to, plot a course of action and find a way for Frodo to be released of his task of baring the desperately hunted ring of power. He fails, being capture by turned-evil wizard Saruman and does not meet up with Frodo at the designated place and time.Frodo and friends being pursued by Dark Riders, the kings of men possessed by the one ring and now Ring Wraiths, is taken under wing by Stryder, a mysterious Vagabond who seems to know more about Frodo that Frodo.The journey takes them to Rivendell, one of home of the elves, and master Elrod. A council of Man, Wizard, Dwarf and Hobbit is convened and nine go forward to destroy the ring, by carrying it into the stronghold of Sauron and casting it into the fire from which it was forged.The Quest take Frodo and Company to the top of a mountain nearly brought down by Saruman to the mines of Moria, where the entire population of Dwarfs mining it have been slaughtered and the Fellowship must face an impress army of thousands of orcs, a cave troll and the satan-like Balrog.In the end the story concludes by not solving anything, but leaving us open for the next film.The ride is breathtaking, the sets are amazing, the costumes, acting, directing, music and sound are all dead on perfect. Peter Jackson never lets the camera stop moving and knows how to film action in a personal and involving way that is rarely seen. This grand operatic quest is on a scale never before seen and the DVD and Dolby or DTS sound are brilliant. There's nearly an over abundance of commentary tracks here, nearly everyone involved gets one, the actors and director / writer are the hands down best and worth the four hours to listen to.Never mind the theatrical version, that was great this is grand. A must have.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
831974,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone taking on Mel Gibson's blockbuster ""The Passion of the Christ"" is obviously the hook for picking up this trio of religious themed ""South Park"" episodes, but ""The Passion of the Jew"" is not the best episode here.  There are three plotlines for ""The Passion of the Jew"" (03/31/2004) and the best is the main one, where Kyle is talked into seeing Gibson's film and is so traumatized he urges everybody at Temple to apologize for what the Jews did to Jesus.  Meanwhile, Cartman is enjoying the apparent endorsement of his anti-Semitic views and is bringing together other fans of Gibson and the film in an apparent attempt to revitalize the Nazi party, while Stan and Kenny have also seen the movie and want their money back, even if it means going to see Mel Gibson and get it back from the man himself.  There are some good shots taken against some of the reactions to Gibson's film, but reducing Gibson to the level of Chris Kattan's Mr. Peepers lets the target get away as far as I am concerned.For me the classic episode is 2002's ""Red Hot Catholic Love"" (07/03/2002), where Father Maxi is apparently the only member of the Catholic clergy on the face of the earth who is not interested in sexually abusing altar boys (e.g., ""The Catholic Boat"").  Meanwhile, a counselor's question about Father Maxi's relationship with the boys has them totally befuddled until Cartman stumbles on the secret of interorectogestion.  The result is a vivid visual metaphor for hypocrisy and a manifestation of the show's toilet talk humor.  Fortunately every time I have seen this episode it has not been on a full stomach, but as funny as Cartman winning his bet with Kyle might be, it is nice to see Father Maxi defend being a Catholic priest, a job that was certainly getting nothing but bad press back then.""Christian Rock Hard"" (10/29/2003) involves another bet between Cartman and Kyle.  Cartman says he can get a platinum record first recording Christian rock music.  Cartman puts a band together with Butters and Token, and just rewrites familiar songs by putting ""Jesus"" in place of words like ""baby"" or ""darling.""  Meanwhile, trying to find their sound Kyle, Stan and Kenny are busted by the Feds for illegally downloading music.  The boys then learn about the suffering of rock stars because of downloading and Cartman learns never to count your platinum records before they are presented to you at a giant public ceremony.  I like the commercial for Cartman's album (which cannot be found in stores).The great irony of this trio of episodes is that not only do they all have a religious theme, albeit one usually mixed with elements of commercialism, but they are essentially parables.  At the end of each episode some one, usually Stan or Kyle, underscore's the message of the story, while music plays that emphasizes we should be paying attention to what is being said because there is a @#&!*#@& lesson here.  Actually, three @#&!*#@& lessons.  Still, you know Parker and Stone are going to be so surprised when they go to Hell and discover it is nothing like the burning inferno they have depicted on their show.",N/A

353511,"Science fiction thrillers of the Cold War era tended to be grim reminders that man's stay on earth was at best a tenuous affair.  PANIC IN YEAR ZERO asserts that when the chips are down in a nuclear holocaust even so-called 'good' folks are more likely to loot and steal than they would like to think.  Ray Milland, who both stars and directs, hits just the right note of grim realism in front of and behind the camera.  Milland is Harry Baldwin, a solid, middle class type who takes his wife (Jean Hagen), his son (Frankie Avalon) and daughter (Mary Mitchell) on a cartrip from their home in Los Angeles to the countryside when the Big Bomb falls.  LA is devastated, though we see it only obliquely as a huge mushroom cloud and hear about it through their car radio. PIYZ is not a big budget film, and its special effects are non-existent.  Yet, not for one moment does the viewer doubt the reality of the atomic war.  Milland, with his weary face and stark grasp of reality, carries the film as he is in nearly every scene.  He knows that the strands that hold society together are fragile, and the Bomb has severed them, possibly forever.  As director, Milland sets up the viewer to accept the bruising of human decency as he places himself as an actor in several minor yet revealing scenes that point out, more to the audience than to him, that law and order ultimately  reside in the barrel of a gun.  The race for survival falls to those who can make the necessary mental adjustment.  Part of the queasy feeling that PIYZ is so rich with is that humanity is held together only by the most fragile of mutual consents.  The opportunity for some savage wilding is apparently too irresistable for many.  The radio intones incessantly about looters, and Milland has to confront a trio of punks that in ordinary times would probably have limited their hell raising to stealing a few hub caps.  Even his own son (Frankie Avalon) has to recognize that killing is a two-edged sword and that to take pleasure in it is to lower himself to the same level as the riffraff.  For Americans who had just recently witnessed the hovering of fingers on the buttons of nuclear armaggedon during the Cuban missile crisis, PIYZ was surely a wakeup call to bless those fingers that did not plunge those red buttoms into their deadly bases.",Panic in the Year Zero VHS

289391,"This is a good example of a b horror movie.  There is plenty of gore & bloodshed to be found here.  The plot is decent as well, set in a textile mill in Gates Mill, Maine because Stephen King lives in Maine.  It is set in a mill that still uses the picker system instead of the automation.The best part of the flick is the final 20 minutes when we first see the giant bat/rat demon in the basement of the mill.David Andrews & Kelly Wolf have never starred in a movie together to the best of my knowledge, but here their chemistry & love for each other is great.  David is a drifter who gets gired to work in the mill for the 3rd shift, I work 3rd also.  Kelly is Jane a beautiful millworker.  Stephen Macht stars as the boss of the mill.  Brad Dourif stars as the loveable exterminator, too bad he only gets 5-10 minutes worth of action.A team to clean up the basement is assigned & David is the leader, they find the bodies of the missing co-workers, some rats which are bigger than they are, but the monster stays mainly unseen until the end.The camera work is pretty good, but at times seems like it was done just to say it was done.  The fact that the movie is set during the 11pm-7am hours of 3rd shift makes the atmosphere of the movie be very good.The directing by Singleton is sub-par at times especially when the monster is seen on the first floor instead of the basement but mainly is pretty good.  The special effects & elements of suspsense in the movie are really good.Only two things wrong with the movie:  1.  The acting is sub-par at times, but not enough to really hurt the quality of the movie.  2.  The pace seems a little too brisk because the movie only runs 87 minutes,  I would expand on it more, esp. showing the monster more.The best parts are:  1. When they first discover what is in the basement & their reaction to it.  2. A secretary loses some papers & goes down to the basement after them, but trips & breaks her back, then she looks to see her demise.  3.  The blood & gore of the movie is enough to satisfy horror buffs.",N/A
432770,"WOW, what a special edition.  I made sure to buy this movie because I know that they only made a few and then they will be gone. I remember that I purched the Laserdisk version that I was able to hear the commintaries. It was very interesting they way they filmed some of the scenes.  For example, the scene where Laurie sees Michael behind the buch, walking home with Annie, Annie runs up to the bush to find nobody there.  She turnes and yells at Laurie ""Lauie dear, he wants to talk to you."" One can see smoke float in front of the camera.  Well, that is where John was smoking while behind the camera. Also, the scene where the samera is on Laurie and Tommie.  They are walking to school, and the camera is across the street.  Well the dolly wheels were squeeking way to much, that the 2 actors had to rerecord their diolog and then loop it in later. It would have been nice to see Nick Castle (the shape) appear in the second Halloween. The scene where Michael slashes Laurie on her shoulder and causes her to fall of the second story stair case.  Well, you see Laurie fall back first off the railing, then a cut.  John had placed a camera on a bungie cord and then ""dropped"" the camera toward the bottom of the stairs. Thus the effect of looking like Laurie is ""falling"" with the camera, but not really. John did want to see a second one made at all. I think that he did a good job on expanding the story to different angles in Halloween 2.  I will not give you the details about Halloween 2 but is a good sequel. I wish that this edition were still avail. I guess that you can find it used.  For you die hard Halloween fans that cannot get enough try to get this version,  you will be glad that you did....",N/A

The third is ""Just what has gone wrong with John Carpenter?""Please tell me that the people who gave this film anything more than two stars are kidding right? Have you ever seen another John Carpenter movie? What is wrong with you people? This is NOT return to form. This is NOT even a good film. The acting is abysmal and if anything John Carpenter has got worse - No! Strike that - he is now the #1 nose-diving director in the history of cinema. In the 1970s, 1980 and even early 1990s Carpenter ruled. Even his mediocre films where better than average and worthy of repeat viewings and certainly DVD ownership. Then came - Village of the Damned (1995), Escape from L.A. (1996), Vampires (1998)... and now Ghosts of Mars (2001)... BOMB, BOMB, BOMB and now the ultimate John Carpenter TRAINWRECK has arrived. Not only is this film devoid of suspense or a coherent storyline but it is also Carpenter's most stupid work to date. The man is not only in quicksand but he IS quicksand, taking down everything he touches with him. Natasha Henstridge has her lamest role to date as she plays an intergalactic cop who is hooked on some LSD drug that actually plays a vital plot twist in saving her from becoming infected. WHAT??? Ice Cube plays a con turned good guy who is there to do what these ex-rappers are stereotypically doing in all these movies... playing to the audience that come to see their one-liners and machismos. Jason Statham, fresh from the movie ""Snatch"", takes on a career low point as a cop in the background running around looking paranoid and angry. The poor Pam Grier had to suffer through this one for only a few minutes but even when she is on the screen boy does it seem like Jackie Brown is something of an acting miracle for her. Worst of all is Clea DuVall. You will be shocked to see her scene in what has to be the worst bit of action acting in the history of cinema as she stands on a sand dune trying to shoot the monsters. I nearly fell clean out of my chair just seeing her arms going back and forth in the most pathetic attempt at a performance you will ever see - ""Help me Mr. Carpenter! Just what is it that I am supposed to be doing here again????"". Reply - ""Shut up and keep dancing up and down as if you are firing those guns at something."" She isn't even looking at what she is shooting. She isn't even paying attention to what her arms are doing. It is like she is having a fit on film. Maybe that scene alone is worth watching this movie for.The plot.. oh good heavens... is about a prison on Mars that has just become host to some sort of a ""ghost"" defence system that turns people into quasi-zombie-neanderthal maniacs that hunt down whoever they see. The leader of that group looks quite nasty but this is pitifully - No, Strike that... pathetically mishandled in the worst way that your mind can possibly conceive. Nothing will prepare you for how OUTRAGOUSLY BAD this movie actually is. Carpenter should be put on ""suicide watch"" after making this one.",N/A
775959,"This beautifully produced DVD is stunning on all levels. More than just a film of an exceptional concert, it perfectly captures George Harrison's life & music and, above all, the love that he gave and received from his friends and family.The evening itself builds from a wonderful opening sequence of Indian music into a quite superb rock concert featuring just about everyone George played with over the years. Packed full of stand-out numbers too many to list, their renditions of ""If I Needed Someone"", ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" and ""Horse To The Water"" are quite breathtaking. And, with virtually no ""I knew George..."" speeches, and with none of the ""stellar"" names seeking to steal the limelight, it's a brilliantly sequenced and perfectly played celebration of one man's music.By the end, and with no less than four drummers, nine guitarists and four organists now on stage, the final number - ""Wah Wah"" - could/should have been a musical nightmare. But, through the sheer quality of musicianship and Eric Clapton's outstanding musical production it is, in fact, the complete opposite... a thundering celebration of everything that's good about rock music which, aided by superb film editing (including several amazing shots of the huge percussion section in full, perfectly synchronised swing), is quite simply the most exciting live performance I've ever seen. And for the encore... Joe Brown's simple, ukulele backed rendition of ""I'll See You In My Dreams"" is a deeply poignant and wholly apt closing to a night totally devoid of ""rock star"" ego & excess.And there's more, for the interviews and rehearsal sequences on DVD Two are not only entertaining in themselves, but re-inforce the over-riding impressions of friendship and admiration from all those involved. Not just a bunch of interesting ""out-takes"" but an integral part of capturing the background to, and reasons for, such a unique event.Eric Clapton's body language while standing behind Joe Brown's heart-rending encore sums it all up - respect, love, sadness, and... quite rightly, dignified pride for a job well done in giving a dear friend the best possible send-off.",N/A

Nicholson reprises his role in ""The Shining"" by portraying himself as a basket case, a routine he uses in about 99% of his roles.""The Witches of Eastwick"" is based on the book by John Updike, but whatever Updike originally wanted to say about the differences between the sexes is upstaged by the hammy Nicholson, who should have been relegated to being the caterer for the shooting location.It's also difficult to believe that the talented Cher, the same person who made ""Moonstruck"" such a great film, would have had anything to do with this mess.""The Witches of Eastwick"" bombed at the box office after word of mouth killed it. It's not a film that will be dredged up from time to time because it was once popular; it wasn't.

After buying this and seeing the wonderful job they did I intend to buy the rest of the collections for Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolf, and the Invisible Man. The movies themselves are great. The care shown in transferring them to DVD is always appreciated when it is done right. In this collection the original ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff is amazing.

322302,"I'm a big fan of 'A Christmas Carol', and I've seen most of the film versions many times.  I like George C. Scott's portrayal of Scrooge a lot.  That 1998 production has a much better look than the 1951 Alistair Sim's version.  The colors are rich and vibrant, the special effects superior, and the secondary characters are well acted.  Patrick Stewart's is also a good film.Then why do I prefer this version better?  Somehow, it seems truer to the time when Dickens wrote the story.  It was filmed in a post-war Britian that was still very much recovering from the tremendous economic dislocations that World War II brought.  The actors seemed more in tune somehow with the bleak late 19th century that was Dicken's time.  In the Scott version, everyone looked, well, too well-fed. And too warm.  Seriously.You can feel the chill of Scrooge's bed chambers when Alistair Sim plays the tightwad.  You identify with Scrooge saving his coal, and tightening his collar. You can understand the real thrill that would accompany the dividing up of his few goods after Scrooge died.  The cemetary that the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come takes Scrooge to seems more cold, dark, and lonely.And Sims inhabits the role better than Scott.  Hard to say that, since Scott was one of the finest actors in the twentieth century, but Scott just doesn't have the absolute glee that Sims has when he discovers he has survived to see another Christmas Day.  Sim literally dances with joy!  The transformation is convincing, and the range Sim shows it superb.  The contrition Sims shows when confronted with his life seems genuine. And I liked the nephew and his family a lot better in the Sims version.  They seemed more authentic and truer to Victorian England.Please, please, please stay away from the colorized version.  It's OK, but the film was made in B&W; and it should be seen as filmed.  BTW, this film is actually titled 'Scrooge'.Very highly recommended. A must-see at Christmas.",N/A
747512,"You simply must hand it to the late Joe D'Amato. During his long career in the Italian film business, good old Joe made dozens and dozens of low budget films in genres ranging from pornography to graphic exploitation to extreme horror. ""Emanuelle in America"" is a Joe D'Amato production, as is ""Anthropophagous,"" ""Buio Omega,"" ""Ator,"" and the best ""so bad it's good"" film ever made, ""Troll 2."" Sure, Joe made a lot of clinkers in his time, but what do you expect? D'Amato's films weren't crafted to win Hollywood awards. Most of his movies raked in the bucks in overseas markets, in places where the crowds filling the theater could care less about what type of schlock they're watching. A few of his movies surprisingly appeared on movie screens here in the States; I saw ""Ator"" at the local cinema in the early 1980s. Moreover, and probably most importantly, Joe's films also made money in America when the videocassette craze broke in the early 1980s. Yep, Joe D'Amato is a beloved figure to fans of schlock cinema, horror cinema, exploitation cinema, and anyone else who loves movies that wander far off the beaten path.I should start by saying ""Killing Birds"" isn't a very good film. In fact, it is at times an atrocious piece of junk best relegated to the trash heap of bad cinema. ""Killing Birds"" as a Joe D'Amato film is closer to ""Troll 2"" than it is to ""Buio Omega,"" with important exceptions. Where ""Troll 2"" was hilarious because of its badness, ""Killing Birds"" is decidedly bad in an unfunny way. Imagine, if you will, a story about a Vietnam veteran who returns to his house in the bayous of Louisiana only to find his wife cheating on him with another man. Enraged by this blatant infidelity, the vet goes on a bloody rampage. He kills his wife, her lover, and a couple of neighbors unfortunate enough to appear on the scene. The murderer does, however, spare the couple's young son. For some reason that I still cannot adequately explain, some birds living on the grounds viciously attack the vet, tearing his eyeball out of his head and thus leaving him crippled for life. All of these scenes unfold against the backdrop of lush foliage in one of those stately old mansions you often see in shows about the South. Sounds like a great premise for a horror film, doesn't it? That's what I thought. I was wrong.Flash forward twenty years or so to a college campus where a gaggle of young adults plan an expedition into the bayou to research a biology project, something about the mating call of a rare bird. The group consists of your usual young people in a horror movie. There are a few loudmouths, the scholarly chick, the oversexed cutie, and a few other stock characters. You get the idea. After heading into the wilds of Louisiana, the kids meet a blind guy (Robert Vaughn!) who lives in a rotting mansion. This man spends his days recording the sounds of the wildlife in the area, so he gives the kiddies a few tips about what they seek and then promptly disappears for a large part of the film. Too bad, by the way, because Vaughn is about the only good thing about ""Killing Birds."" Even in the short time he appears onscreen he gets all the best lines, does a competent job with a bad script, and even manages to look and act creepy. Anyway, the young adults head out into the bayou, set up base in an abandoned house, and promptly die in cheesy ways as a host of weird zombies appear on the scene. It's all really lame in the strictest sense of the word, with cheap looking gore effects, bad acting, and dumb dialogue. The movie doesn't end as much as it skids to a halt.Most of the elements we take for granted in other films fail to materialize in this one. The pacing of ""Killing Birds"" is glacial, a molasses like mess that moves with all the speed of a snail on tranquilizers. I didn't just glance at my watch once in awhile with this turkey; I looked at my timepiece so often I developed a serious case of whiplash. I would like to tell you the pacing was the worst part of the film. It's not. Check out the music for this mess. Never, in all my years of watching bad films, have I seen such a schizophrenic score. The scenes at the beginning of the movie, when we meet the kids, employs an interesting (cough) blend of bland pop music that you must simply hear to believe. Pure treacle of the most abysmal sort, like ""Dreamweaver"" but worse to the nth degree. Then, an abrupt change takes place. Maybe D'Amato dug up Jan Hammer to score most of the film because what we hear when the researchers encounter the zombies sounds a lot like ""Miami Vice."" I'm not even going to go into some of the outfits the guys wear in the film. Let's just say I had serious questions about their sexuality. I wonder why the girls in the group didn't have the same thought.I can't give ""Killing Birds"" one star, though. The movie did manage to dredge up some creepy atmosphere in the end, and Robert Vaughn's appearance helped salvage the film. The DVD version is your typical Media Blasters/Shriek Cinema disc: trailers for several other schlock classics, an extended interview with Robert Vaughn about his role in the movie (!), and some other stuff. I cannot recommend this movie without feeling guilty, and I certainly cannot do so to viewers unaccustomed to cheesy movies. Horror fans should steel themselves for an unpleasant experience before popping this one in the DVD player. All others need to stay away. Far, far away.",Zombie 5: Killing Birds
158620,"I grew up watching these films.  I went to each of the three original releases at least 10 times each with my friends.  I (or, more often...my parents) purchased just about every Star Wars toys around at the time.  I helped to make George Lucas a millionaire MANY times over.  I cannot believe that he would completely change & re-do the films that made him so completely rich...& made so many people happy.  If he wants to release these new ""& improved"" versions along with the originals that would be one thing.  But, to change the originals so that they almost don't even appear to be the same movies is a tragedy.  I WILL NOT buy these DVDs & I refuse to watch the next film when it comes out.

563832,"After seeing this film twice at the Vancouver Film Festival, visiting from my home in Mexico, I could hardly wait to own it, even though it was only available in VHS. I find it fascinating and disturbing that Saura's masterpiece, as non-linear and right-brained as any great work of art, should be maligned by critics such as Roger Ebert, and others. Here's to those who've written their praise for the film on these pages!This is extraordinary creation, a fusion of both outer and inner realities that the logical mind cannot grasp - and why must it? Does it really matter what happened factually to Goya? Aren't those fiery skies and the music of Boccherini,  reflecting the fire and brimstone in Goya's mind, enough to tell us that the film is mythic? Shakespeare did the same thing with his tragic heroes because the Elizabethans and the alchemists believed in &quot;as above, so below&quot;. Macbeth's turmoil is reflected in the storms outside, and the bloody battles raging around him. Yet that's fiction and we believe this world is reality..I buy few films, and I cherish this one. I'm still longing for  &quot;Providence&quot; to come out on DVD because Resnais  interweaves life and art from the same perspective...an old man, a writer, dying among his living, breathing creations. I live in an Mexico's oldest city, on a street named &quot;Cinco de Mayo&quot; Every day I'm reminded of Goya's painting, and this film is shown at least once a month on TV because the Mexicans love it - the Latin world has no problem suspending reality in the name of art - which is why Andre Breton called Mexico the ultimate surrealism. Thank you Saura, once again.",Goya in Bordeaux
740743,"This is one of those movies where the previews make it seem really exciting, and then when you get into the theater, it's a letdown.  I think the problem was the plot.  It was missing something.  Also, I felt a bit confused as to what was really happening towards the end.  I think if del Toro had left all of those monsters out, and concentrated on the main enemies (Rasputin, Kroenen, and that weird blonde chick), this would have been a LOT better!  Plus, the ending just seemed too clean and easy.  I was expecting Hellboy to have to do some real fighting.  LOL And what's up with the cats?!??!  I would recommend seeing it...but don't hold your breath.  Maybe the DVD will be better...but only if it has LOTS of extra features.",N/A
374228,"Clerks is the little film that could. Made with a shoestring budget using black & white 16mm film stock, Clerks is the shining example of how a film with no funding or exposure can achieve success with great writing, an original premise, and word-of-mouth buzz.Since 1994 Clerks has become a gigantic cult hit, and Miramax did a great thing by releasing this 10 year anniversary set, for it contains tons of extras, more than enough for any Clerks fan to crap his pants in joy. The second disc contains the first cut of Clerks, with extra footage. The extras disc has a whopping hour and a half documentary taking the viewer from Kevin Smith's childhood all the way through the making of Clerks and it's purchase by Miramax. There is an animated version of ""the lost scene"" at the Wake. There is also a Q&A; with Kevin Smith and cast, Kevin Smith's journals, and even his student film from his days at the Vancouver Film School.The picture quality for the first cut is grainy, but the quality of the theatrical cut is superb, and will probably be the best Clerks will ever look since it was originally shot on 16mm.Anyone who is a fan of Clerks should definitely pick this up, it gives you a new perspective on the film and lets you in on the behind the scenes details on the making of the movie. If you are new to Clerks, you should also pick this up, for it is only slightly more expensive than the regular DVD but has superior quality and tons of extras.",Clerks VHS
785117,"I can't help but think that the mixed reception this film has gotten has more to do with its pretensions than its reality.  It is a very competent, if stagecrafty, vampire film.  It features lots of atmosphere and dramatic, gothic filmogaphy.  It takes place in a setting that is half Prague and half London - underground scenes, castle scenes and even a chase or two.  Stunts and costumes are excellent - the film uses costumes and stunts rather than CGI for it's effects - for a result that is, as someone else remarked, half Dracula and half Matrix.The premise isn't completely original, but is well worked out, making vampires and lycans (werewolves) a kind of medical accident arising in the depth of the plague years developing a complex hierarchical society with vampires at the to and the werewolves at the bottom.  This somehow impacted, and lycans and vampires are at war, with the werewolves at a disadvantage.In the midst of a hunt Selene (Kate Beckensale) finds that a nest of werewolves is determined to capture a human - Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Her investigation puts her at odds with her coven's leader, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and the ensuing events reveal something so menacing that vampire and lycan are threatened.In essence this is a pure action film not a horror film.  There are gestures at romance and the politics of the night but the primary movement is set scene - chase scene - fight scene.  While the acting is generally competent - Beckensale is quite good, and Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are excellent as lycan and vampire elders - it isn't spectacular.  Certainly not good enough to make what director Ken Wiseman thought might be 'the greatest vampire story ever told.'Seen purely as what it is, 'Underworld' is an enjoyable, fast-paced film that presents in interesting vision of life in the darkness.  Held against an arbitrary standard of greatness or a belief that it is the deconstruction of the vampire mythos, it falls short.  The Dracula remake is still the pinnacle of this genre, and may be for some time to come.  One the other hand I could watch films like this one after another without a single qualm.The extras, feature films on the making of , etc., and several commentaries are excellent, and throw some interesting light on the film and its characters.  If you like foreboding technogothic thrillers this is made for you.",N/A
57253,"This film delighted, entertained, and surprised me when I first saw it on the big screen in 1988.  Why the surprise?  Because I never dreamed &quot;Ahnold&quot; could hold his own in a comedic role.  But the Austrian muscle man creates laughs as easily as he bashes heads together, and TWINS remains a perennial favorite of mine.As ridiculous as the plot is (Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are the products of genetic engineering gone awry), this movie succeeds because of the chemistry between the two actors.  It's more than obvious to the viewer that Arnold and DeVito had a blast making this movie, from the action scenes to the way the actors mimic one another to create the &quot;twins&quot; effect.  It's all great fun to watch, and the timing between the two is pure bliss.The movie's tender moments are overly sappy--yet still very effective (especially DeVito's character), and the scrumptious Kelly Preston strikes one of the most memorable poses in all of cinematic history.  Director Ivan Reitman delivers a quality comedy, which makes TWINS a thorough feel-good experience.  Pop this puppy into the VCR and enjoy.--D. Mikels",N/A
667062,"While it's a high-action, low-plot film with a creative patchwork of screenplay, Amores Perros is definitely a movie you should watch at least once. It's effortlessly fresh and original.The movie's style is certainly inspired by the stylism of Pulp Fiction or Traffic. That is, it consists of three stories that tie themselves together in the end. This method of film making has become such a clich&eacute;, but it can be done if the director succeeds in making each story equally interesting. Unfortunately, Amores Perros starts with a bang, but its final two stories drag on while the viewer struggles to stay awake. (And it is a looong movie!)The first story of the film is, to say the least, brilliant. It revolves around a young man named Octavio (Gael Bernal) who enters the bizarre world of dog-fighting so he can earn enough money to run away with his abusive brother's wife and child. Things, however, do not go exactly as expected, as the dog-fighting goes terribly wrong, and Octavio's dream of running away is crushed.As far as the first story goes, Inarritu did not wrong. In fact, it's easy to say that this segment of the film is flawlessly executed. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting and the lighting all come together to create quite a spectacle. The fact that Inarritu chose to use this segment first was really a poor decision. When it ends, I was left looking for something at or around the same caliber, and I was greatly disappointed with what came next.The second story concerns a model named Valeria (Goya Toledo) living with a her boyfriend who left his wife just to be with her. The beginning of the story is intriguing, but the ironic coincidence is that when the two lovers' lives begin to fall apart, the movie takes a turn for the worst as well. Instead of the entertaining and fast paced love thriller Amores Perros had been to this point, I was now treated to a obnoxiously slow and boring tale of a degenerative relationship.Story three is, well, better, but that's not saying much. The story revolves around a supposedly mysterious man who gave up his family and life to become a rebel. His rebel days behind him, the man (Emilio Echevarria) is now a bum/assassin for hire who walks around with a pack of dogs. During a 'job' the man rediscovers his former self, and realizes what a grave mistake he had made by leaving his family. This part had vast potential but it's clear that the director did not try to develop this man's character for a sort of mysterious effect. Sadly, I found that I knew so little about the character that I really couldn't care less what his fate was.As a whole, Amores Perros stacks up to be a slightly above average movie. It runs simply far too long, and it does not focus enough on the first story, which is the only thing really carrying the film.But that shouldn't detract you from watching it at least once. It's a very worthy rental if only for the glimpses of directorial brilliance.",Amores Perros

583313,"Back in the 70's, when I was a kid, black & white films were as common to television as they were back in the 1950's.  Many a time I remember staying up to see this film on the midnight movie during the weekend or during the Saturday Monster Matinee. The film was both suspenseful and frightening. I have always enjoyed this film and despite todays better movie making techniques think this film is as enjoyable now as when I was a kid.The films running time is just around 90 minutes. The movie moves fast and this helps to hold the viewers attention. Christian Nyby directed the film and is a master of keeping the story moving and putting as much story into every scene as he can. Nyby later directed the PERRY MASON television show that ran during the 50's and 60's. That show required a director who could condense as much story as possible into a very limited time slot.The actors, while not well known, except for James Arness who played the alien Thing, but that does not detract from the films acting quality. There is a romance between two of the characters but it is a small back story. The man focus is on the alien Thing and the survival of the base personnel.Some people may not enjoy the film if they are going to hold it to the same technical standards of the 82' remake or other more modern Sci-Fi films. However, if you are someone who can just sit back and let the films suspense and story carry you away this film should prove and enjoyable view.Lastly, the DVD in typical Warner Brothers tradition is underdeveloped.  This is a 50 year old classic and deserved better treatment.  There are enough cast members alive to have put together a decent documentary or commentary.  A retrospective feature with interviews from other Sci-Fi actors and film makers would have been nice as well.  Thank goodness the DVD producers at least included the original trailer.

729951,"Although today Mary Pickford is mainly her known for her child roles, she was actually a versitile actress who alternated her parts accordingly. However, audiences of the time much preferred &quot;Little Mary&quot; to her more mature roles and so, to please her fans, Pickford concocted Little Annie Rooney and it was a huge hit.Pickford (then in her early thirties) plays the rambuctious preteen daughter of an Irish cop. The dirst act of the movie plays like an episode of Hal Roaches Little Rascals with Pickford's multi-ethnic gang battling fiercely with their rivals. However, there is trouble at home. Annie's older brother is hanging out with a grown-up gang, a groups of ne'er do wells who have pretentions of being big city gangsters.Meanwhile, Annie developes a crush on the big brother of her arch-rival.  William Haines is appealing as Pickford's &quot;grown-up&quot; love interest (Haines was 25 at the time) Pickford's leading mean in the teens were often stodgy and boring next to her spunkiness and it is nice for her to play against a leading man who is equally energetic.As is usualy for a Pickford film, tragedy strikes and she is forced to save the day in the nick of time.This is not one of Pickford's best films but it is a very good one, showing her doing what she did best, NOT acting her age.  The supporting cast is good although some of the ethnic stereotypes can cause some uncomfortable moments for modern audiences.  And Annie's father is forced to speak (via intertitles) in a distractingly Lucky-Charms-Leprachaun-style Irish accent.The climax is a bit too sappy but Pickford knew her audience expected happy endings and delivered accordingly.  These are really the only flaws in an otherwise charming movie.The same cannot be said for the disc packaging.  While the print quality is pretty good (though, as another reviewer mentioned, a scene is repeated for no reason) the soundtrack is highly inappropriate.  It was the 30's reissue soundtrack for the D.W. Griffith film &quot;Way Down East&quot; which, with it's themes of marriage and blizzards, utilized the wedding march as well as wintery tunes.  This was fine for WDE but it is just terrible when played along with Little Annie Rooney.Budget discs often cobble together soundtracks out of classical records and I would almost prefer it to this.  I can only suggest that viewers turn the movie music down and put on a CD or have a musical friend or relative play along with the movie.In conclusion, this is a fun, but not brilliant, later Pickford vehicle that delivers all the humor, sentiment and energy Pickford fans can expect.  The movie is better than it's packaging.BUY IT IF-  You're a Pickford fanYou like silent comedyYou want an entertaining, light, old movieYOU WON'T LIKE IT IF-  You're into heavy dramaYou don't like sentimental movies",Little Annie Rooney

""Night of the Komodo"" had a no-name cast, lousy script, lousy special effects, and was a complete waste of time. The good news is ""Python"" had a couple B-level actors in the cast, and appears to have had some kind of budget...the bad news is, that it is as much a waste of time, and as hard to sit through as ""Night of the Komodo"" was. You may see Robert Englund's name on box, or hear about Jenny McCarthy's cameo and your interest might be piqued....squelch that interest right away, or you will be dooming yourself to a wasted evening of watching this film! The thing is..I love B movies, ""Tremors"" should have been nominated for an Academy Award it was so good. I am first in line whenever a new ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" movie comes out. And I still think the original ""Pumpkinhead"" may be one of the most underrated movies of all time. Hell I even found something to love about Lou Diamond Phillips & ""Bats"". So I do know what I am talking about when it comes to B-movies. ""Python"" is just bad. I think the thing that killed this movie for me, was the half-hearted attempts at comic relief. If you are going to include comic relief make sure it's funny. The two dimwits working in the plating factory was just awful, then you had the goofy realtor trying to sell McCarthy a house.....just plain bad. To top it all off, you have Wil Wheaton sporting purple hair and body piercings? Having Wil Wheaton try to come off as a ""bad boy"" is like having Clint Howard pose as a male model..it just won't add up.

It's like a adventure movie to discovery of one's plight and characters that intermingle very well into the film.If I was to suggest this to anyone,I would say this:IF YOU ENTIRELY LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT &quot;LEAVING LAS VEGAS&quot;, then you should love everything about &quot;Love Liza&quot;.Has the same qualities and story telling as that classic. If &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; had ANY elements that you didn't like about it, then you probablly won't like 'Love Liza&quot;.

The Bride's past is fleshed out and we learn what led up to the massacre at the wedding chapel which left our heroine in a coma and with a thirst for vengeance.  Thurman is still perfect in the role she was born to play, and Carradine gives his best performance in years.  Still though, you can tell this was a film that Tarantino made more for himself than for the movie going audience.  It's still his homage to grindhouse cinema, and it's still as fresh as Volume 1.

I never saw this in the theater and I am glad that I waited.The characters Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are excellent.  Throughout the movie because of Clint Eastwood's style of directing you feel as though you know who really did what and it makes sense but when you find out the truth you realize that that was the more sane explanation.  It is a real intellectual thriller.The extras are good on this movie especially the commentary by Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.  WATCH OUT though, if you are watching the movie for the first time, don't use the commentary because they give away the plot and critical themes before the end of the movie.  They are pretty hilarious and that gives you a better understanding of the movie.  It helps you catch things that you would not have notice like the only time that Tim Robbins character tells the truth.I would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy intellectual thrillers.  It's not a lot of blood and guts but gives you many emotional turns from happy, to sad, to revenge, to helplessness.",N/A
786525,"Millennia ago, primitive man found fear from the unknown.  That same fear exists today in each of us.  Call it what you will, but ultimately it boils down to horror.  A dictionary definition refers to it as, ""...as sense of dread or forboding"".  A film character, in a haunted house, looks at the doorknob to her room as it slowly turns (only she's supposed to be alone).  The emotion that she feels could well be defined as horror.  When you are alone and you have the distinct feeling that there is someone else there - that's horror.There is a distinct difference between horror and gore.  Cabin Fever is a gore film.  It is not a horror film.  That said, let's take a look at it on its own merits...Cabin Fever is neither particularly scary, nor is it original in the least bit.  It borrows so much of its storyline from a multitude of other films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, The Evil Dead, to name a few).The actors are all unknowns with the exception of the lead boy (Rider Strong) who was formerly on Boy Meets World, a television show.The premise is this: college kids rent a cabin in the deep woods for a week, but somehow manage to catch a severe case of the dreaded (sarcasm) flesh eating bacteria.There's some doper who stumbles across them as they tell ""campfire"" ghost stories to each other outside the cabin - which makes no sense, because the cabin has a fireplace - for no reason than to later end up as a footnote in the carnage.  (And why is his dog in such a bad mood?).There's the three rednecks sharing a single brain with murder on their mind for no darned reason at all (this whole storyline even includes a semi-retarded kid ala ""Deliverance"").To be certain there is lots and lots of gore.  The filmmakers must have gone through gallons of Kayro syrup and red food coloring, because the blood looks anything but like the real thing.  That's not to say that this film isn't gross - because that is one thing it really is.Gross.If you are actually past your teen years you'll probably look away from the screen as I did.  Not in fear or horror - but because gross is just not scary - it's shock value only.I thought I was going to see a horror film - not a gore film.  I can't say that I recommend this film unless you want to see one pair of quite obviously surgically enhanced breasts and a young man (Rider Strong), who desperately either needs to shave both his face and that nasty patch of hair on his chest (and trim that pit hair while you're at it) or hit the gym - because, yuuuck - it's a horror all on it's own.",Cabin Fever

Their characters come together well, especially after Anna (Jenna Elfman) returns to NY for a career move after being away since she was young girl.The flash back and then forward sequence is excellent.  You almost forget where the movie started because there are so many cute twists to the movie.There is also a lesson in the movie, one of love and compromise and you get a sense of the challenges people face when they make life choices as far as career, marriage and family issues.This is a fun movie, good for the DVD library.

158447,"Finally the original Star Wars trilogy is on DVD! But from the arguement on both sides of the table, my generation isn't satisfied. As Vader said, ""I find your lack of faith disturbing."" From my vantage point, I have the ""original"" original Episode IV - A New Hope, my sister has the 1st remastered trilogy, I also have the 2nd remastered gold trilogy and 3rd remastered ""special edition"" trilogy with the new scenes and CGI effects. I agree with my generation's side on Solo v.s Greedo scene. George Lucas should've left it alone. As for the Moss Isley scene, they missed Lucas's point on why he wanted more people and activity in it compared to how the ""original"" scene was. Back in 1976, the studio execs were rushing George on a deadline for Episode IV's release. He didn't have the technology and materials to make Episode IV completed the way he envisioned it. Although over 90% of Episode V and VI were done, but the remaining portion had to be added with new scenes and CGI.Yes the prequels didn't meet every Star Wars fans' expectations due to the lack of story writing. But that's meant for the new fans who have to keep going back watching the original trilogy after Episode I and II to know how the story and characters are connected.And from what I'm hearing is this dvd trilogy has scenes with Christen Hayden replacing a previous actor's scenes as Darth Vader? Or is it the trailor that's been extended with scenes from Episode I and II to go with IV, V, and VI?In conclusion, I'm adding this new dvd trilogy to my collection and seeing how Star Wars has evolved in 27 years.

731763,"SMILEY'S PEOPLE continues the series begun in SOLDIER, SAILOR, TINKER, SPY, so do your self a favor and buy them both.  It's hard to describe the plot of this series without giving away clues from the prior series, but suffice it to say, in SP George Smiley continues his ""cleanup"" of operations at the Circus.Several of the actors appearing in the previous series appear again in this series.  Those missing are dead or incarcerated. New actors are introduced as spies and superspies from both sides of the wall.  The cover features a nighttime shot of a defection not unlike the scene in THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Will he make the crossing or be shot be his own side as they realize what is happening?When I first watched the series (both SPY and SP) I found one scene in the latter - when Smiley visits his old pal Molly forcibly retired from the Circus, and living out from Oxford on a dark road in the ""country"" - particularly frightening. Molly functioned as a research librarian at the Circus before her dismissal, and she has incredible amounts of knowledge tucked away in her brain. Smiley and the other Secret Serivice analysts charged with synthesizing information collected in the field by British operatives, and coming up with the ""Big Picture"" depended on Molly. The viewer gets the distinct impression that Molly knew something that some insider did not want shared around. Does Smiley's visit put her in danger?  Will she be shot to keep her quiet?  Dead bodies do pop up in this series, which in some ways is more frightening than the first set.Watching both series is a great way to spend a weekend, and I recommend them both.",N/A

614591,"UNCLE is still my favorite show, even if it is dated (and even though I can now see how they re-used that red brick mansion over and over in many episodes).  Recently, Film Score Monthly magazine has released two double-CD sets of original UNCLE music, and I've been reimagining the shows in my head as I listen to great, catchy music.  I've waited since 1965 for real, original UNCLE music, as heard on the show.  Yippee!Why this show is not on DVD perplexes me.  When it was released on tape, they didn't pick the best episodes, but the ones with the biggest guest stars.  Bad move, but better than nothing.For a 1960s show that's not in reruns, it still isn't forgotten.  I recently heard Elvis Costello on a talk show describing a recording studio that was unexpectedly located in an old building.  He said, ""It was like 'The Man From UNCLE'"".  I could hardly believe my ears!  See, people still talk about it.  Please release it while we're still around to buy it.(The part below was added in 2008).After years of waiting, UNCLE is finally on DVD.  I knew it would be, because I had just finished taping all the episodes from the American Life cable channel.  But as good as they looked on cable, they still played a bit faster and looked choppy when the camera moved from side to side.  I suspect they removed some frames to speed it up.I haven't noticed that with the DVDs.  I bought my set from Time-Life because I just had to have it.  Had I waited, I'd have saved some money, but after forty years, I wanted to make sure I got it.The quality is excellent, and the interviews are nice to see.  But what David McCallum and Robert Vaughn probably wanted to say was that the show was mostly a job for them, and they don't see it or remember it as young fans would.  It sounds like they had fun doing it, but everlasting fame doesn't pay the bills.  Plus, they saw the props up close and had no illusions about them, unlike us 11-year-old fanboys.One of my favorite parts of the series is the music.  The original soundtrack is available on several CDs, which I also snapped up.  I'm sure that part of the success of the show is the music.  And how odd was it to have the theme rearranged each season?  My favorite is season 2, partly because that's when I became a fan, but mostly because of the bass line in it.Another item worth mentioning is the quality of the guest stars.  And I don't mean just the big names (though I love Vincent Price's episode).  The acting quality of the ""ordinary"" guest stars is very good.  I can't recall names, but they went a long way toward making the viewer believe that the show really visited other countries.  Sure it was fake, but the foreign actors did give us a chance to see and learn something about other cultures.And last but not least, I want to thank the late Leo G. Carroll for being in the show.  Actually, it was by accident, because the network wanted the producers to get rid of the K-guy (Kuryakin), but they axed Will Kuluva by mistake.  One of the best mistakes ever made, I'd say.Forgive me for using the word ""gravitas"", but that's what Mr. Waverly brought to the show.  In those days, there were a lot of older people in charge of things, unlike today, but his character was completely believeable and likeable to my young (and now older) eyes.  He had that ""voice of God"" quality (there's a character term for it - omniscient perspective?) where everything he said seemed true and right.  Mr. Spock had that in Star Trek, and Dumbledore has that in the Harry Potter series.Leo was not blessed with good looks, but he was the linchpin that the entire show revolved around.  Sometimes I wonder if the show would have done as well with another actor in his role.  We'll never know.  But a good British accent is hard to beat.  His casual line, ""Oh don't touch that Victor, you'll blow us up,"" is still one of my favorites.So you take good actors with chemistry, give them good writing (despite a few stinkers like that godawful gorilla episode), add in great music and excellent photography, top it off with great gadgets, and you've got a classic TV series.Side note:  Today we have doors that open automatically and pocket communicators that can dial the world.  But where are the cars with the gull-wing doors?!  (I got to see the real UNCLE car at a car show, which was one of the thrills of my childhood.)  And I mean *affordable* gull-wings.  Maybe some young UNCLE fan will make this come true someday.",The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Complete Series

800741,"This is an ambitious film in which playwright and novelist, Ronald Harwood, adapts his own play of the same name for the silver screen. Having successfully written the screenplay for the film, ""The Pianist"", which was based upon the best-selling memoir by Wladyslaw Szpilman,  Harwood is no less successful here. With the deft direction of renowned Hungarian director Istvan Szabo and the thespian efforts of its stellar cast, the film thematically explores a number of moral issues, though in the end, it leaves it to the viewer to resolve them.The film explores the aftermath of the fall of Hitler's Third Reich through the investigation by Allied Forces of world famous German conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler (Stellan Skarsgard). This was part of an investigative effort to discover Nazi collaborators within Germany's artistic community in the belief that there had been collusion between politics and art for the sake of politics. It was also believed that by rooting out Nazi sympathizers and collaborators among its influential members that the Nazi ideology would die a natural death in Germany for lack of iconic leaders.Wilhelm Furtwangler undergoes a series of interrogations by a Major Steve Arnold (Harvey Keitel), a  narrow-minded American officer, who has been given orders by his superior officer to find this musical icon guilty of war crimes at any cost. Furtwangler is suspected by the Americans of having been an influential Nazi sympathizer who, through his music, renown, and virtuosity, swayed the German people to march to Hitler's tune through their love of music, so deeply imbedded in the German psyche.Arnold, a claims examiner for an insurance company in his former civilian life, approaches his subject with all the disdain and disrespect he can muster. Thorough, yet loutish and seemingly culturally ignorant, the loud-mouthed Arnold is worlds apart from his targeted subject. Deeply affected by newsreels of the death camps in which millions were brutally killed, Arnold approaches Furtwangler as if the conductor had been an integral part of the final solution.Arnold's German secretary, Emmi (Birgitt Minichmayr), whose father was executed by the Nazis for an aborted plot to assassinate Hitler, and another Allied Forces officer, Davis Wills (Moritz Bliebtreu), a secular German Jew whose own parents died in Hitler's camps, are present during Arnold's impassioned interrogation of Furtwangler. Arnold's examination of thehapless Furtwangler sets the stage for the moral issues with which all the parties grapple and the viewer is left to ponder.Harvey Keitel is excellent as the self-appointed avenging angel who sees things only in black and white absolutes. Birgitt Minichmayr is outstanding as the conflicted secretary, whose remembrance of her own interrogation at the hands of the Gestapo causes her to lose regard for Arnold. Moritz Bliebtreu is compelling as David Wills, who remembers Furtwangler as having been instrumental in inspiring his love of music and deplores the tenor of Arnold's interrogation. It is Stellan Skarsgard as Furtwangler, however,  who steals the show. His sensitive and complex portrayal of the seemingly  morally ambiguous Furtwangler is pure cinematic artistry.Based upon true events, the film does not resolve the moral issues for the viewer. There is, however, a very telling  vintage clip that follows at the conclusion of the film that shows the real Wilhelm Furtwangler with Adolf Hitler. What transpires is quite interesting and subject to interpretation. It is also consistent with the moral ambiguity of the film. One will have to decide for oneself what spin one cares to place on what one sees and decide which side of the moral divide one places Furtwangler, as well as oneself. All in all, this is a compelling and complex film. Bravo!",Taking Sides VHS
449938,"I was a big fan of Major League, but was somewhat disappointed in Major League II, and as a result didn't buy Major League III for more than a year. I'm sorry about that, because it turned out to be as good as or better than any in terms of its story and execution, and casting.In the first Major League, we got a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes, which held up well even though I thought the personal lives of some of the players was stressed a little too much. In Major League II, which is still entertaining, I think the chemistry suffered because of this and other continuity issues. For instance, Wesley Snipes, the base stealing pheenom, was replaced by another actor, yet we are supposed to believe he's the same person. Doesn't quite work. Also, the love interest focus switched from Tom Berenger to Charlie Sheen, and we are supposed to know all about (and root for) a former girlfriend we have never seen before, and whose existence wasn't even hinted at in the first film. And finally, the chemistry suffered a little more because the feud between the owner and the players was reintroduced in an unlikely way (why would she buy the team back if she wanted to get out of Cleveland so bad in the first film?). Still the second film was enjoyable and worth having, even with these issues.So, I expected a lower budget, poorer result with Major League III, and boy, I was wrong. New characters and a new situations develop, and it all seems appropriate and fresh and the acting is top notch; the cast plays like a team and the script moves forward like a well-oiled machine. The music and photography are excellent and the action is in general spontaneous and very fun (like when the villan manager of the Twins hits himself in the head with a richocheting baseball).

Whenever US had some fine president, they got him killed like Kennedy, or impeached like Clinton, and then think that someone no woman would like to fool around with will be up to the job. The father's limitation was he couldn't do two things at the same time (for example stepping down some stairs and chewing gum). I was not sure the son can even do one only thing at all, but now I am, except anyone thinking that getting US down the drain can be regarded as a great achievement (except for those who still believe God is really pleased with suffering, and who were many enough to ask for four more years in misery). But, at least, this family is faithful to their beliefs, since the son could not think of anything else but to resume the war started by the father, and, this time, only demonstrating that it's the sheer opposition of two fanaticisms resulting from the complete dedication in superstitions based on dogmas they pretend to be religions.

551160,"With the second season ""The X-Files"" raised the bar and managed to maintain a series of excellent seasons through the sixth. After that, the distraction from the production of the movie and Carter's other lesser series (""Millenium"" which borrowed the look and texture of ""Seven"")began to take its toll. Nevertheless, even season seven was far above average.The story arc involving the alien conspiracy kicks into high gear and all the major players are in place by the time of the second season. Season two starts off with ""The X-Files"" closed down. Mulder and Scully have been reassigned nevertheless, ""X"" is Mulder's friend inside the FBI. Eventually, the X-Files are reopened and Mulder & Scully discover far deeper mysteries than they ever imagined during season one. The highlight of season two, for me, is ""Duane Barry"" and ""Ascension"". Production values are up as well during this season which means that the effects and sets improved. It's clear that Fox released they had a hit on their hands.We get all the original broadcast episodes with the addition of Chris Carter's commentary on nearly half of the season. There's also international clips (which are always good for a chuckle)and also a number of great extras. What matters is whether or not the set is worth it based on A) The quality of the episodes and B) The quality of the transfers.A) The writing establihed a benchmark that all other series (from ""CSI"" to ""Buffy"")benefited from. While Carter may have been inspired by ""The Night Stalker"" television series, he way beyond that series with drama that could hold its own with the best of mainstream television.B) The picture isn't always as clear as it could be but, again, we've got nearly 4 hours of complex images on one dual layer disc.

This is what sets ""The Passion of the Christ"" apart from every other film made about the life of Jesus.  Many deal with the life of Christ, and others with his teaching.  ""The Passion of the Christ"" deals with one very short, and particular, period in his life: those last hours, the Passion.  The American Heritage Dictionary includes as one of the definitions of ""passion"" as ""The sufferings of Jesus in the period following the Last Supper and including the Crucifixion, as related in the New Testament"", and that is exactly what this film is about.  This is Mel Gibson showing us what Jesus went through and at times I could almost hear Gibson saying ""This.  He went through this for us.""While ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a very brutal movie, and perhaps half of the film features in some way the beating that Jesus took on the way to Calvary, it isn't the violence that has stuck with me after the movie ended.  What I found particularly memorable were some of the smaller moments: the flashbacks that showed Jesus with his mother (Maia Morgenstern), Jesus teaching, Jesus with the apostles.  Just as memorable, though, were the moments of betrayal: the look between Peter (Francesco De Vito) and Jesus after Peter denied Jesus for the third time, Mary (the mother) and Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) together weeping at the torture Jesus is suffering, and any time we saw Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) moving through the crowd, or tempting Jesus.  Lastly, Mel Gibson's handling of the Resurrection was particularly moving.  It is a mix between beautiful and simply powerful moments that allow this movie to rise far above what could otherwise be called (and has been) nothing more than two hours of Jesus being beaten.What makes reviewing this movie a challenge is that it is very difficult to separate the story from the filmmaking.  As a Christian, the story is one that is very familiar to me and is also one that I personally believe in.  As a reviewer, I have questions about Mel Gibson's storytelling.  If I knew nothing about Jesus of Nazareth and was not familiar with the story of Easter Week, would I understand what is happening in ""The Passion of the Christ""?  The film lets us know that this is a man named Jesus who is being persecuted, that it is the Jewish Pharisees of Jerusalem which have brought charges against Jesus to the Romans, and they feel that he is blaspheming God.  For this they wish Jesus to be put to death.  What the film does not go into is why.  Are these Jewish leaders just blood thirsty?  Are they threatened by Jesus' teaching?  Is there a serious law that he has, in fact, broken?  Why are they pushing so hard for his death?  ""The Passion of the Christ"" does not answer these questions.  Someone who does not know the story of Jesus may not know why he is being brutalized to this extent and what promises Jesus' life and death, and resurrection bring.Viewing the film from my perspective, the lack of that detail being in the film did not affect what I think of it.  ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a bold, moving, powerful film and the fact that the subject of the film is so central to what I believe only makes it more so.  I cannot speak to what a non-Christian would feel about ""The Passion of the Christ"" because an emotional response is so personal and subjective, and that emotional response is exactly what ""The Passion of the Christ"" taps in to.  The combination of how skillfully Mel Gibson has crafted his film (excepting that little issue with exposition) and the emotional response that it encourages, this is arguably one of the best films of the year so far and may very well be a contender for Best Picture come Oscar Season.The one criticism that I would like to address here is the charge, of some, of anti-Semitism.  It is one that I do not understand.  At the beginning of the film, when Satan is tempting Jesus, Satan mentions that carrying the full burden of sin is too much for one man.  The suggestion is that Jesus (and therefore God) is choosing to do this, and that Jesus knows what is coming.  In fact, Jesus says as much in the flashbacks throughout the movie.  Moreover, while it is true that it is the Jews who turn Jesus over to the Romans, there were some Jews who spoke up against their leadership saying this was wrong.  It was also only in the power of the Romans to condemn Jesus to be crucified and the film shows Pilate symbolically ""wash his hands"" of the whole affair, which was a cop-out.  Pilate made the decision.  It is also the Romans who are brutally whipping Jesus as punishment before he is to take up his cross.  The implication here is not that the Jews nor the Romans who are specifically guilty, but rather: All are guilty.  All.  With Gibson's hand being the one that drives the nail into Jesus, he includes himself in the ""all.""-Joe Sherry",N/A
815757,First off let me say Yee Haw. The Dukes of Hazzard is the greatest show ever made. But I have 1 question. Why isn't Tom Wopat at the 20th Anniversary Barbecue. Matter of fact I don't think his name was ever brought up by the ones that were there. I wish they would have had more commentary and invited every living cast member to do the commentary. Cathy and Johns commentary on the first episode was great. I can not wait to the other seasons come out on DVD. I hope they do more special features on future DVDs though. I would like to see how the sets they used look like now days. A feature on just the General Lee. Some behind the scenes footage and such. But even if none of that happened I would buy them just for the show itself. My favorite person on the show was Rosco. James Best played the part perfectly. And one day I will own a 1969 Dodge Charger and paint it orange with 01 on the side and a rebel flag on top.,The Dukes of Hazzard: Season 1
423845,"Based on Frederick Knott's Broadway hit, Wait Until Dark is a chilling film, even by today's standards. This is a masterfully crafted thriller about three deranged crooks who manipulate a blind woman to recover their lost smuggled goods.Audrey Hepburn is fantastic as Suzy, in her Oscar nominated role, showing us a fairly realistic portrait of a fragile woman coping with her dark new world. She manages to garner our sympathy, especially with Efrem Zimbalist Jr's demanding husband watching her every move.Alan Arkin is equally terrific, making a terrifying villain.Wait Until Dark manages to create a paranoid environment devoid of any human life. The apartment building Suzy lives in is perpetually empty; Suzy's husband, Sam, leaves her on her own for most of the day, and the dorky young girl upstairs is apparently motherless most of the time. The cave-like arches of the apartment has an unsettling effect of positioning Hepburn in a nondescript underground (the windows only look out on the feet of passersby, emphasizing Suzy's disconnect from her neighborhood). It all creeps up on the audience, making for a suspenseful, claustrophobic and effective shocker. I literally could not breathe during the film's final ten minutes.Definitely wait until dark and watch it with someone who likes to scream. This is a true nail-biter if there ever was one.",N/A
304375,"I feel sorry for Sylvester McCoy. Because of bad management decisions at the BBC, he didn't get a proper regeneration sequence,  his first season was horrible AND short since it wasn't written for him. He was saddled with two companions, one, Mel, who was an unbelievable annoyance and then Ace who eventually had some good moments but also had a mush-mouth and it was often hard to hear what she was actually saying. He only had 12 adventures to play the Doctor on TV at the time and about 8 of them were pretty bad. &quot;Fenric&quot; is one of his better shows but unfortunately that's not saying much. Sometimes, things are not clear in this story, such as the badguy being an old enemy of the Doctor and this really does seem to come out of nowhere. McCoy's Doctor being very secretive and manipulative? Never quite worked for me and I felt the show was at it's worst during his era. He did have some good shows, though, the best being 'Remembrance of the Daleks', 'Happiness Patrol' and 'Battlefield'. Fenric runs in place right after. Keep in mind, I don't blame McCoy but pretty much everybody ELSE involved at the time, right down to the sound man who apparently didn't know what he was doing either when you can't understand  a lot of the incidental dialogue spoken by your two lead actors. Go buy ANYTHING form Tom Bakers 12th, 13th and 14th season or Colin Bakers 22nd season for the very best in &quot;Who&quot;.

219272,"For a Best Picture winner, this surely won on the sheer bravado of Cecil B. DeMille. The legendary director provided the real Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey circus and a bounty of stars in colorful roles for this tale of circus life and how &quot;the show must go on&quot; despite trauma and tragedy. Charlton Heston stars as Brad, the control-focused circus manager with an over-bubbly Betty Hutton as a trapeze star, Cornel Wilde (with a French accent) as &quot;the Great Sebastian&quot;-a rival trapeze star, Jimmy Stewart as &quot;Buttons-a clown&quot; who stays in makeup to hide from the police due to a scandal and tragedy of his own, and a gorgeous Gloria Grahame (who was hired when Lucille Ball couldn't do it) as the Elephant Girl---who will be in great danger from her sadistic partner. The Technicolor is awesome as are the gaudy costumes but it's the dialogue that's really colorful---I guess &quot;purple prose&quot; might describe it but even that phrase pales in comparison to what comes out of the actor's mouths. This is VERY ripe melodrama  set against a wonderful (and real) circus background and you are treated to some admittedly great sights---particularly an incredible trainwreck. The actor's do their best and there are some wonderful guest stars and cameos like Dorothy Lamour as a circus entertainer, and some real surprises I can't reveal. So for pure Hollywood spectacle and some of the corniest dialogue and situations ever created see &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; and thank Hollywood for treats like this.

This would distinguish it from Hitchcock parodies such as Mel Brooks' ""High Anxiety"" which is played for laughs instead of thrills.

689706,"I do understand the criticisms that people have put against this film. The sex scenes are explicit, but I feel they are justified. Yes, Leticia (Halle Berry) had been mourning the death of her son and this makes it distinctly uncomfortable viewing. However, in times such as these, the human spirit turns to basic wants, whether comfort eating or sexual pleasure. The difference is not that vast.The reason I applaud this film so highly is not so much for the acting, as this has been widely admired, but for the directing and the film in general. Things happen suddenly in this film and they often seem random. The end does not tie up neatly. But this, this strange ambiguity is what makes the film so real. Things do occur in life which are random or seem by chance (whether truly random or not is down to your personal belief) - like Hank being the one who passes Leticia and her son in the road, things do not tie up neatly, often you make decisions which are strange but perhaps necessary for you, like Leticia's choice to remain with Hank at the end. Having said that, this is left slightly uncertain and perhaps she does not stay with him.Neither of the two main characters are perfect. Leticia abuses her child, and Hank is a racist bigot. Once again, this makes the film more true to life - nobody is perfect. I did not personally really sympathise with either of the characters, but it almost didn't matter as the story was still worth telling.The film made me feel very much an observer, not someone drawn into the film - again this struck me as a sign of truly magnificent directing making this story true to life - you can never be inside someone else's story. You can only observe and emphathise with their story through your own experience, which is precisely what this film makes you do.People have criticised the implausibility of the sudden love between the two main characters. However, I want to point out that the characters do not at any point say that they love each other, and their relationship seems more a product of mutual need. I think this is realistic - two people in difficult situations, not necessarily in love but keeping each other company. Company is often vastly underrated. I feel this is a film about company in the worst situations.",Monster's Ball
853898,"There is a scene deep into Yimou Zhang's Hero that burns with inspiration. A warrior bent on assassinating the king of the kingdom of Qin, Broken Sword, enters the chambers of His Majesty and begins a violent assault for which the king is well-equipped. The two men battle with a ferocious intensity, unencumbered by excessive slow-motion or flying effects, while huge tapestries of lime green plunge to the ground like majestic birds shot to their deaths. The scene has suspense, it has intensity, it has life...and unfortunately, that's the only time you'll find those things in the 96-but-feels-like-200 minutes of Hero.Which is kind of shocking, considering the movie starts out with such a promising fanfare. Against a slowly forming background, we learn of the history of China 2000 years ago: how it was divided into kingdoms, how they all fought with each other, and how one king attempted to bring it all to a close. Unfortunately, being a king and all, a lot of people want his ass dead, so the poor dude can't get any sleep. Finally, though, a nameless warrior ends His Majesty's worries by wiping out the three deadliest assassins and the king wants to hear his story. Nameless (Jet Li) proceeds, guided by a rather nice panoramic shot, to the chamber of the king and rests 100 paces from him, with the promise to advance paces at the king's behest. So he begins his story, and the framing device of the film is set up. If Hero had remained in that room with Nameless and the king, it would work. There is a message about honor, about duty, and about patriotism that arises from the film's present-tense frame that I found intriguing in parts. Of course, it would only last about 15 minutes if it did that, but as of now, I'd take that over the pure, shameless tripe that gets slung during the flashbacks.Hero is a perfect case of simply trying too hard. The first flashback of Nameless' murder of the first assassin, Sky, culminates in a dull battle overstuffed with relentless slow-mo, Matrix-esque bullet-time effects, and - but of course - Crouching Tiger flying. I don't have anything against martial arts; I think it's a compelling art that has created some enjoyable cinema. Director Zhang, though, doesn't seem to think that the existence of the violence itself is enough, though, and he insists on hampering it with special-effects flourishes, one after the other. It's tiring, uninspired, and - worse yet - kinda boring.The film moves on to the next stage of Nameless' quest, in which he must get rid of the last two assassins, lovers Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Slowly but surely, Hero reveals itself as what it truly is: an ultra-expensive movie that disguises its vapidity in a frame story with echoes of themes done 100 times before, and 100 times better in other movies. One of the more unnerving aspects of the film is its presentation of metaphors. Instead of subtle gestures that even a semi-stupid audience would get, things like ""music is like sword-fighting,"" and ""calligraphy is like sword-fighting"" are written into the script and said multiple times! Even the visual beauty of the film gets old: cinematographer Christopher Doyle (who so brilliantly photographed Phillip Noyce's Quiet American and Rabbit-Proof Fence) drenches the set pieces in a single color scheme for really no other point than to look pretty.And I'm sorry, call me old-fashioned, but this crap just comes across as silly. I'm not a huge fan of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I don't really remember unintentionally laughing at some of the flying scenes. Ang Lee's film created that visual as a kind of extension of the characters' abilities: the characters of Tiger seemed so skilled that it just seemed logical that they could defy gravity. Hero just seems like it had extra money and some strings hanging around.There is a decent message (trite as it may be) hidden deep within the film, and when the plot opens wider into a Rashomon-like angle, Hero has brief moments of narrative intelligence. In fact, a scene following many of the flashbacks, in which an important revelation about the king's fate is made, is flat-out well-done. It's all lost, though, in the endless, pointless exercise of style that consumes the bulk of the film. Hero is far from heroic; it borrows from so many other movies, I'd go as far as to call it a wimp. C-",N/A

A worthless first half is thankfully redeemed by some very impressive special effects in the second half and a terrific sense of atmosphere endures throughout. It's an old film (circa 1987) but The Gate still holds up well and is worth a look. Of particular interest is the fact that this is Stephen Dorff's first film role...and one of the better creature features of the 1980's. It's definitely what 80's 'B' grade horror is all about...heroic kids in way over their heads and going toe to toe with apocalyptic evil. Man...it's so horror nostalgic it brings a tear of joy to my eye, but the thing that made this particular movie great was it's emphasis on subtle creepiness rather that just straight out shocks and gore...and whilst some of the acting, clothes and hairdos leave a lot to be desired (hey...we're talkin' the 80's here kids) it's so much darn FUN to watch...even today. Now don't get me wrong...this film is as cheezy as they come and all you 'Freddy vs. Jason' fed youngsters out there will probably think that it's lame...but for us gen 'Xers' this is cult- classic gold.

429819,"The Batman movies have always gotten mixed reviews. BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS were mostly looked upon as being great yet too dark. BATMAN FOREVER AND BATMAN&ROBIN have received major mixed reviews with the fourth movie receiving most of the negative reviews. Well, here is my personal review of each film. BATMAN is just about perfect in every aspect. Great story, great acting, not childish, and a dark tone that suits the movie. BATMAN RETURNS to me ranks up with the first. The dark tone is a bit more emphasized but it doesn't ruin the movie at all in my opinion. The acting is good, especially  Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (hear her roar!) and the story holds up as well. BATMAN FOREVER is different from the first two in the sense of not having a very detailed story, a lighter tone, and of course the arrival of Robin. Though somewhat fast-paced, the story still is good and Val Kilmer did just as good of a job playing Batman as did Michael Keaton. Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones bring so much personality to the characters of Riddler and Two Face. Aside from certain differences, this still ranks up with the first two movies. As for BATMAN&ROBIN, I realize that there were some noticable flaws. However, I have no problem overlooking them since I am a Batman fan. This movie is the first of the four to have a few plot holes but it's really not enough to ruin the overall film. A number of people hated George Clooney replacing Val Kilmer but again, it wasn't enough to ruin the movie because George did manage to do a decent job. Some situations were very predicatable and the villans acted a bit cartoony but being a fan of Uma Thurman and Arnold Schwarzenegger I personaly enjoyed seeing them play the villans. BATMAN&ROBIN also brings about the character of Batgirl. Despite the flaws, this movie still manages to entertain just as the others. I would like there to be yet another sequel to the franchise though it probably won't happen due to the fourth Batman not doing so good at the box office. I think the reason that some were displeased with the last two Batman films is because the tone and style somewhat changed but overall a Batman fan should definately enjoy all four.",The Batman Legacy Four Film Giftset  VHS

How about the lack of respect for human life we teach our children when we say a woman has a right to choose a late term abortion, even if that means we karate-chop a 4 lb baby's head before it's even out of her womb? How about the way we teach our children that God can't be trusted by teaching them it's wrong to say His name in school?Remember this: Hitler, Saddam, and Stalin were all avid gun-control proponents. First they disarmed their perceived enemies, legally, of course, then they killed them. If you think it can't happen here, today, look at some of the rhetoric around you.",Bowling For Columbine VHS
149053,"I had never seen this film. I saw several scenes in the middle and clips from commercials, but I had never really liked westerns, and, from what I understood, spaghetti weserns were the worst. When I finally decided to see this movie, I did so only as a means of sarcastic entertainment, the &quot;Plan 9&quot; syndrome. I was blown away.Right from the first I realized how much of Leone's style was employed by my other favorite directors. I loved the comedy, action, and melodrama so much in fact, that when I compiled my Top Fifty, this masterpiece shot to a not too modest number two.A recurring theme throughout the film is the concept of there being &quot;Two kinds of people in the world.&quot; This is an intrigueing concept to me because that statement is contradicted by the title and by the complexity of the many characters tthat appear throughout it. Things aren't limited to just good and bad, blue and gray, rich and poor. There are are many factors that go into each individual, and this is one of the things that makes the film so memorable.The cinematagraphy is the best of any film I've ever seen. In the film are some of the best panoramas and close-ups including the Greatest single shot in history. (Orson Welles, eat your heart out!) I think Roger Ebert gave the best explanation when he discussed the limited perception of the camera and characters.I do have a few quarrels with certain things they changed to extend it to its original Italian version. Though I wouldn't say this in most cases, the new dubbing should not have been done by the original actors. Their voices have changed so much that the new scenes sound dubbed by bad impersonators. In fact the best new dubbing was Lee Van Cleef's. He was the only actor who didn't do his own dubbing. Death can have that effect on your career.Ultimately, this is not only the best western, but one of the best melodramas, comedies, war films, and one of the best films ever made! A very enthusiastic FIVE STARS!!!",N/A
563817,"Any fan of Nick Park and Aardman studio would expect so much from a dvd like this which unfortunately disappoints badly in all respects.Beware!!!!! The dvd consists ONLY four short films from aardman. Other than the ever popular, groundbreaking short claymation ""creature comforts"" which also won Nick Park his very first academy award, there's ""wat's pig"", academy award nominated ""adam"" and ""not without my handbag"". The running time of the disc is barely half an hour. Forget about any extras on the disc, the sound and picture quality is just not of a dvd.There's much much more about three time academy award winner Nick Park and Aardman studio than just these four shorts! Those who have a multiregion dvd player or watch dvds from different region on their pc, have a brilliant option of buying a dvd named ""AARDMAN CLASSICS"" from region 2 (also available from AMAZON.CO.UK).

It is a real complete collection of award winning short films from aardman studio on one dvd.Inspite of the four great films it consists, ""creature comforts"" dvd is just not worth your money.

685982,"John Dahl is a great director and I would prefer to see Hollywood take better notice of this guy. As far as Joy Ride goes - you get what you paid for - Comedy/Horror/Thriller with lots of suspense. This is not Dahl's best work but it fits that genre nicely in a &quot;Scream&quot; mixed with &quot;Duel&quot; sort of way. Actually the cinema print was different from the DVD because the bad guys face was not seen at all but they restored lots of that for the DVD (which has like a zillion alternative endings!)This is pure pop-corn fodder but it is still good and the suspense is all there. If you are looking for cheesy horror/suspense films then you can not go too far wrong with Joy Ride. It is entertaining, but not exactly Oscar winning stuff as I am sure you are not expecting.More John Dahl please. He is a good director.",Joy Ride

713890,"By many standards, even for the slasher film, Jason X sounds questionable.  A part ten, of any series.  Set in space(!)  A long break from the previous films.Yet, Jason X is easily one of the best Friday sequels, period.  The movie is fun.  The attitude is consistent, and it's contagious.  The filmmakers were having fun, they're doing a movie for the fans, and everyone wins.This is easily one of the best Friday DVDs; actually, it is the best, even better than the 2-disc Freddy vs. Jason.  For one, there are two documentaries that go a long way toward framing the film as a fun exercise by series fans, for series fans.For obvious reasons, the 'traditional' slasher film can no longer be made, having been done so many times with such minimal effort (including several Friday sequels), as well as spoofed and spiced up (the Scream films).  A healthy dose of self-reflexivity and some other elements are needed to make the formula watchable.  Jason X is also a kind of one-off in the series; since it's mostly set in the future, it hardly fudges the 'continuity' of the series, which is largely incoherent by now anyway.  They've got free reign to do whatever and have a ball with it.Hundreds of years in the future, high school students from Earth 2 come across the cryogenically frozen body of Jason Voorhees along with an injured female.  Using `nanotechnology' (the newest buzz technology for sci-fi and video games), they thaw them out and 'reconstitute' them.  The female protagonist remembers she was overseeing the 'handing over' of Jason to military for experiments since it was impossible to execute him (a funny bit of dialogue).  Of course, it's not long before Jason is up to his old tricks, dispatching hapless students and 'Aliens'-tough Marine grunts on the ship (named Grendel, of course).The film really works on its own terms as a low budget but stylish, whimsical continuation of a series that ran out of gas a while back (witness the nadir, Jason Takes Manhattan).  The director is Jim Isaac, who has a great background for this stuff since he was an effects man on several of David Cronenberg's films, and Cronenberg himself has a cameo in the beginning.  The film is low budget but stylish; the lighting is pleasant and creatively colors the sets to look like more than they are.  The acting is often hammy, but those involved (especially the scientist) seem to be having a good time.  Harry Manfredini does the score, and it's his first Friday score ever released on CD, and for good reason.  For one, it's pretty damn good.  The earlier Friday films (up to V) featured recycled cues from the previous films.  Parts VI and VII featured more proper, expansive scores (still very servile to the genre, of course).  Jason X has plenty of different elements ranging from traditional 'stalking' music, to action cues, to cheesy, triumphant, space music, to eerie suspense.  It's a great disc for fans, and does hold up on its own.As for Jason, Kane Hodder is back and clearly loves his role.  Just watch him in the documentaries, he likes playing Jason, he loves the stunts (his original vocation) and he loves the whole fan boy element of these films.  There's also plenty of gore.  The MPAA butchered most of the Friday films, after the original became a hit and a backlash began because of the gore.  Not the case here, so we're treated to at least two of the best Friday kills ever: the liquid nitrogen bit, and the giant screw(!)  Of course, the film is not scary.  It's a hybrid of horror, sci-fi, action, and comedy, very aware of its own cheese.Again, the DVD is excellent.  The film looks and sounds great, with a good commentary by the director, writer, and producer.  There's a trailer, two docs, and a particularly demented 'Jump to a Death' feature.  Perhaps Paramount, owners of the first eight Friday flicks, will get the hint and put out some decent DVDs of those films.",N/A
681837,"In November 1987,Tom Selleck,Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson began to delight audiences with their #1 blockbuster ""Three Men And A Baby"". Three years later,the sequel ""Three Men And A Little Lady"" was released. It didn't score as high as the first film at the box office. Robin Weisman is the 5-year-old little lady Mary in this film. The six-month-old baby in the first film was played by twins Lisa and Michelle Blair. The three men of course,are Peter Mitchell(Selleck),Michael Kellam(Guttenberg) and Jack Holden(Danson). Peter,Michael,Jack,Mary and Mary's mother Sylvia(Nancy Travis) are all living together now. Peter,Michael and Sylvia in one scene are at a meeting with the principal of an elementary school that Mary has been enrolled in. Jack,an actor dressed as Count Dracula,shows up at the meeting late(he was filming a TV commercial). Mary in another scene is taught by Peter the definition of the word ""penis"". Peter and Sylvia are both shocked. Michael was quite amused. There's also Edward,who's an Englishman like Sylvia. Edward directed Sylvia,who's also an actress,in a broadway play. Edward and Sylvia,romantically involved,plan to marry in their native England,taking Mary with them. Edward deceptively schemes to enroll Mary at the Pileforth Academy,a boarding school there. In another scene,Sylvia is extremely angry at Peter because of some comments he made when Edward visited. She slapped him hard in the face. So Sylvia,Mary and Edward head for England. So Peter,Michael and Jack throw a party just like they did in one scene from the first film. Mary was sad to leave her father Jack and his two roommates. So Peter and Michael surprisingly travel to England to visit Sylvia,Mary and Edward. Jack was filming a movie so he couldn't join his roommates. Jack,dressed as the late Hollywood great Carmen Miranda,phones Michael in England. Jack said he wouldn't be able to attend Edward's and Sylvia's wedding. But,Jack,as himself,later arrives in England in time for the wedding,which never happens. As the bogus wedding begins,Peter,Michael and Elsabeth,Pileforth's principal,crash the ceremony with the enrollment list for the next term on which Mary appears. Sylvia had not known about it until this point and she become furious at Edward. I said ""bogus"" because the unofficial ceremony was performed by Jack,made up as an elderly priest. Sylvia decided she's going to continue living in New York and tells Peter,""You can see Mary as much as you like."" Peter told Sylvia that he loved her. So a real certified priest enters the chapel,marrying Peter and Sylvia. Jack catches the bridal bouquet thrown by Sylvia after the ceremony. WAITING FOR A STAR TO FALL,performed by Boy Meets Girl,on hit parade in the fall of 1988,is played during the end credits. By the way,Sylvia's mother,of course,attended her daughter's wedding. She also visited in New York where Sylvia,Mary,Peter,Michael and Jack live.",N/A

791856,"One of the most original and hilarious sitcoms to come our way within the last ten years, the fifth season of Absolutely Fabulous proves that there's still fresh life of the two divas.  While the fifth season will probably boast a continuity of big name guest stars following the post fourth Season, ""Gay"" with Elton John and Minnie Driver and Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), what makes this show precious are the total fads Edina latches onto for further success, beauty, or whatever (always doomed to backfire), Patsy's new femme dictator role running her pal Jeremy's shop (yet still has lots of vulnerability as the less liked), and Saffy's new coming to terms of becoming a mother herself, whose righteousness seems to work against her as she finds herself pregnant.  Also much welcomed are Marshall and Bo whose schemes for fame to be with Hollywood celebrities have totally fallen to the absurd (adoption/""baby-napping"" services for celebrities?  Fake Fat Infomercials?), and in the meantime Bubble's just as airhead-like as ever, and yet somehow she has become the Shakespearean Fool, who may in fact ""not be completely useless.""  (Jan Harooks' most funny moment, however, must be as Katy Grin providing a news report from Kuwait of the Iraq conflict in the season opener.  Watch for it!)Of course, the slapstick and very cleverly scriped put downs are in fact quite fresh, and unlike Season 4 where similar references to the first three seasons seemed totally rehashed (with the exception of Saffy's play episode), any similarities here seem to be more fresh.  Much kudos to Saunders who may have heard criticism that the show has come of age, and yet with this season proves it can still has quite a bit of its luster.  Are the shows as say slapstick and as classic/vintage Ab-Fab as earlier seasons' ""Hospital"" or ""Poor""?  Maybe not.  But this season proves that this show still has quite a bit of energy and Jeniffer Saunders still has lots of creativity and fresh ideas.",Absolutely Fabulous - Complete Series 5
49084,"Well.  Time to write a review of this on Amazon.  So many things to say.  A beginning is a delicate time.  Well, lets state the obvious first and foremost.This movie was a flop.  A bomb.  A disaster.  It cost a great deal of money to make and it made almost nothing at the box office.  This was due to a number of reasons.  One, in the early eighties, science fiction was considered very uncool.  So that any young dude in the early eighties worth his salt wouldn't be caught dead going to this movie.  The other matter is that any of those young dudes who DID happen to wander into this movie probably had to wonder just what the hell was going on.Dune is very challenging science fiction that almost might be considered the work of a genius.  It is far more complex and interweaving than the plot for something like ""Star Wars"" for example.  By that, I'm not saying that Star Wars was a bad movie, indeed, it was a very profitable one (unlike Dune).  It is just that from my viewpoint, it is incredible that this movie was even created at all, considering the usual attitude of movie studios toward complex plots of any kind whatsoever.  In fact, I would go so far as to venture the guess that this movie being a flop set a standard for one dimensional movie plot lines for years to come.  A movie must make a profit, the dumber the movie, the bigger the profit.Anyway, the point is this movie somehow, against all odds, WAS made.  And the director, to add to the weirdness, was that master of weirdness (the weirding way?) himself, David Lynch.  Right away, Lynch went about ""weirding up"" the plot, adding his own eccentric touches (the cheesy sound weapons aren't in the book at all they were put there by Lynch maybe he thought the young dudes would find sound weapons cool).With David Lynch at the helm, production went forward.  It went very well.  Until they ran out of money and time.  This is why the final battle sequence is so wretched.  The editing in particular was done at the last minute and wow, does it stink.  Note how in the final battle the soundtrack changes at a machine gun rate, the trademark of poor editing.Despite it all, it remains the BEST VERSION OF DUNE AROUND.  And for this, I am thankful.  If this movie had never been made, I would never have started reading Frank Herberts novels.  And that, I think, is the real point of any movie version of a book.  To get the kids READING.",N/A
629715,"Except for The Passion of the Christ, this is the most important film of the year, and everyone who still harbors a modicum of respect for our present government should see it.That said, the movie had some problems. First, believe it or not, I think Michael Moore does not give Bush enough credit with respect to the first half of his presidency. More importantly, we should be careful in giving Michael Moore too much praise for anything, ever.Let's be honest: Bush did the right thing, sometimes.There are some things Bush has done for which we should praise him - things for which Moore seems to fault Bush, but which I'd like to see Bush do a lot more.For example, Moore faults Bush for spending a record amount of time in office on vacation on his ranch, during the first part of his term. How can that be a bad thing? Time spent on vacation is time not spent bombing the rest of the world, oppressing citizens at home, and growing government to a record size. I would go so far as to assert as an axiom that the more time a president spends playing, the better. (Warren Harding may be the model president in this and most other respects).Moore also wants us to be disturbed by the fact that Bush remained in a Florida classroom reading My Pet Goat for seven minutes after being told that America was ""under attack"" on September 11. Roger Ebert describes this as the ""most devastating"" thing in the whole film. But this piece of information has never disturbed me in the slightest. The only objectionable aspect is that he stayed there for only seven minutes. As with vacation, the more time he spends in an elementary school classroom with a blank look on his face, the less time he spends doing anything else. I'm happy about having seven more minutes of freedom than I otherwise might have had. I wish he were still down there.Moore also seems to fault the Transportation Security Administration for allowing you to take matches and lighters, but not your own breast milk, on board an airline flight. For this, he credits the influence of the tobacco companies, who want you to be able to smoke before and after you get on a plane. I don't know what basis he has for this assertion, but even if it's true, I'd say good for the tobacco companies. Now, allow cigarettes to be smoked on flights, as long as all of the passengers consent, and we might have something like freedom. Of course, Moore's main point is that the TSA is not about security at all, it's about the government befuddling and controlling Americans, with virtually no regard at all for genuine security risks.The movie could have bolstered its own credibility where it counts by eliminating some other extraneous criticisms. No matter how much I may dislike Bush, I will never get upset about him ""stealing"" the election. Every election is always stolen from anyone who did not cast a vote for the winner and therefore did not consent to whatever the winner might do to him. I'm not even upset about the Supreme Court deciding the election, because that means we're just nine voters away from abolishing democracy entirely.The worst thing about Fahrenheit 9/11.There are more serious reasons not to get too excited about Michael Moore.Keep in mind that this movie's success will give Moore more influence over the minds of the American people. When he wants to speak again, through another film, he will have the country's full attention.And when, perhaps thanks in part to this film, John Kerry is elected president, what will that film be about? A devastating critique of welfare statism? Of course not. In all likelihood, it will be something like an attack on the alleged evils of Wal-Mart. And given Moore's undeniable talent as a propagandist, to the mass-man who does not understand economics, that film will look every bit as credible and persuasive as Fahrenheit 9/11.Surely anyone would agree that it's ethically wrong to give someone money, when you know for certain that they are going to spend it on a weapon with which they will commit a murder. Is it any more conscionable to give Moore money and accolades when we know he's going to spend his enhanced credibility on advancing economic ignorance, and, if he is successful, increasing poverty and even death in countless unseen ways?Well, maybe. It is a great movie.Regardless, let's celebrate a movie that, as the noted political philosopher the Libertarian Jackass has observed, has the laudable goal of ""bring[ing] down a president."" Bringing down a president is fun, and we should revel in it, and do it more often.But at the same time, we must be circumspect. As good as this film may be, remember that Michael Moore is a man who doesn't want you to be free to buy the products you want, to hire whomever you want, or even to defend your own person, property, and family.When the tables inevitably turn on the neocon regime, he will once again be our worst enemy. We would be wise to continuously acknowledge that, and never fail to remind everyone of why he is so wrong about everything else.",Fahrenheit 9/11
146790,"Is this Stanley Kubrick's best film? Absolutely.This director has some good and some bad films. He also has some very poor ones and some really great ones. He is overrated as a whole, but if you can find his better films then they certainly do stand out among the rest for their respective genres. Here he is the Lord of filmmakers. There is no question that this film has everything that makes the director's status as the cream of the crop.This film was made in 1957, but just might as well have been made in 2004. The acting mostly resembles that clich&eacute; 1950s type acting where the actors are somewhat aware of the camera but that does not matter and after ten minutes this common acting production problem is certainly consumed by the weight of the plot, technical direction and the outstanding performances of all concerned. When the camera does those long and timeless tracking shots down the trenches you can only be mesmerized by the sheer boldness of its originality and massive undertaking.This is the film that launched Kubrick's career and put him on the Path of Grandeur. This is akin to saying that it is Stephen Speilberg's Jaws, Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, James Cameron's The Terminator or Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. It defined the director and is THAT important on his list of films that you should see. Sadly this film by Kubrick has been eclipsed by ""Spartacus"" because it was made three years before that film with the exact same star. Unfortunately this means that whenever we hear the words &quot;Kubrick&quot; and &quot;Douglas&quot; together we think of Rome and Gladiators. In truth we should be thinking France and World War I.Based on the book by Humphrey Cobb this is part war film / part military courtroom drama. It is about the wastes of war as a somewhat young lawyer (Douglas) plays the French Colonel Dax who is on the Western Front with his army. Most of the very realistic war scenes take place in the trenches and some on the battle field. Colonel Dax is ordered to capture the German enemy who are awaiting them on the other side with more firepower than they can handle. Under intense and often stupid political orders Colonel Dax is in a crises of his command. On one hand he must show his strength as a leader to his seniors and on the other he must defend his troops from the exploitation of absolute corrupt bureaucracy. This same theme was played out in the more recent movie ""The Thin Red Line"". The later part of this film is about soldiers who are made whipping boys for the legion's failures and losses. The Colonel, as a lawyer (and their battlefield leader), acts as representation for these men. The film poses many questions and answers important issue that are very relevant for our time.*As a note Kubrick's wife, up until his death, is the woman singing at the end of this film. The film was also banned in France for its portrayal of the French army.*This is simply one of the best war dramas you will ever likely see, not to mention one of the best courtroom dramas too. Both worlds melt perfectly together as one in this great, provocative, cerebral and touching motion picture film. Vote no one into government who has not seen this film, period. It should be mandatory viewing for all political science professionals and is certainly the most important dissertation about conflict since Sun-Tzu's ""The Art of War"".This is Unquestionably, Most Excellent Cinema.",Paths of Glory

Anyone who loved Frank Marsales' smoking jazz soundtracks for early Warner Bros. shorts will adore the rip-roarin' theme of this little-known series.Unfortunately, the reason these cartoons are &quot;forgotten&quot; is that the vast majority of them feature racist images which we, thankfully, no longer have to be subjected to as a part of popular culture. While a cartoon historian can accept them as a common aspect of this genre, most people will probably find them offensive enough to wish to avoid this series of releases altogether.

362025,"Brandon Lee plays Eric Draven in this story of revenge and justice. Eric Draven and his fiancee are alone on &quot;Devil's Night&quot; which has been named that because of the crime and arson that goes on in the city. Devil's Night takes place on the night before Halloween. Eric and his fiancee are interrupted by a group of thugs that rape and kill Eric's fiancee in front of him, and then proceed to kill him. Now the idea of The Crow is this; when a person dies, a crow carries their soul to the afterlife, but sometimes the crow will bring the person back for unfinished business. Guided by the crow, Draven returns to exact revenge on those responsible for the rape and murders, and he targets each and every person involved. He returns as a tortured soul, bent on revenge for taking the life that he and his fiancee Shelly wanted to live, a life that was taken from them for no reason.Along the way Eric is helped by Sargeant Albrecht, who is the only one who truly cared about bringing the killers to justice. Every time Eric kills one, the task at hand gets harder as he gets to the source of the evil.This is a superb film, perfect in every way in my opinion. It is dark, graphic and I would even go so far to call this a true masterpiece of American cinema. Brandon Lee plays his role with a passion, truly giving the dark feel of this film and the message behind it. It really is a shame that he died, I think he would have been a great actor. But this is his legacy, and it is a great legacy to leave behind. I have not seen the 2 sequels yet, but I am fairly certain this is the best one. I encourage you to see this movie if you haven't already.The dvd itself is packed with extras that take an interesting behind-the-scenes look at the film as well as other things. The movie really sounds great turned way up on a surround system, and the picture quality is great.I should also mention the soundtrack to the movie, which is one of the best I have ever heard. Seeing this will make you want to buy the soundtrack, it is just that cool. My only regret about this movie is that I didnt see it sooner. So I have given my opinion, and I really recommend that you see this movie. If it isn't considered one already, it will go down as a true classic in cinema for the rest of time.",N/A
814706,"LOTR is without a doubt the best trilogy ever created. Each movie, FOTR, TTT, ROTK, are excellent on their own and as a united piece are unstoppable. None of the movies have major faults, like bad acting or Ewoks or crappy plot, but stand on their own as amazing features. Really meant to be watched as one very long epic, the Lord of the Rings is the best thing to ever happen to cinema. No more Hollywood garbage, but instead passionate filmmaking from both cast and crew. The eternal themes of JRR Tolkien are fleshed out, and as opposed to other recent trilogies, the amazing special effects (which garnered three academy awards) do not distract from the storytelling, but augment it. Peter Jackson and his crew spent seven years doing a phenomenal job bringing to life the unimaginable. The casting was perfect. The ensemble shines on screen. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen are particularly magnificent. Sean Astin does a superb job throughout the trilogy going from sidekick to heartfelt hero in the final installment. Elijay Wood does an exceptional job portraying a peaceful, happy hobbit descending into madness, ultimately ending up in a conflicted state where his former peace is gone.

Yes there's lots of blood, gore and violence but if you give it a chance you will see that it is all so over the top, it is almost cartoonish and you won't take it so seriously.If you have seen it and aren't going to watch the vol.2 because you think it is more of the same, you will be pleasantly surprised with a diologue rich, fraction of the violence, well completed story of revenge.

Because I was riveted!  never bored, holding my breath, hoping for a good outcome.  Maybe it was a little more sombre than it needed to be (did we really have to include pedophilia, dog immolation, mom-and-baby murder and quadraplegia??  wait, I left out prison rape!) and at times even with my ""skeptic"" lights off I wanted to chuckle at some of the bizarre consequences (kind of like a photonegative of It's a Wonderful Life, where Donna Reed without George would be... a librarian!  the end of the film is a little bit over the top in how much better things will be if...)BUT.

771968,"I recently rented on DVD my very first Tae-bo workout, Tae-bo Cardio Circuit 1.  I enjoyed the workout but, though I have been working out regularly for some time, I found it too advanced for me.  At age 22, I probably could have handled it, but at age 52, I could not.  In the store yesterday, I found this DVD Tae-bo Cardio.  I did the workout this morning and, happily, it is similar to Cardio Circuit 1 but, even better, it is 10 minutes longer and not quite so intense. It's a very good workout but I was able to follow it all the way through to the end...there were just a few times I had to march in place, but it was only because I couldn't do as many reps on the first try as they were doing, not because I couldn't physically do a particular move (as was the case in Cardio Ciruit 1).  I didn't mind this, because not being able to do all the reps on the first try shows me that I have room to grow in this workout.If you've already been working out regularly with cardio and you want something really intense, I would suggest Tae-Bo Cardio Circuit 1.  However, if you want a good workout but not something that is so intense that you can't keep up, I would suggest you start with Tae-Bo Cardio.The only negatives that stood out to me in these DVDs:1. It's sometimes hard to hear Billy over the music and the counting of his exercisers. THis is much worse in Cardio Circuit 1 than in Cardio.2. Billy doesn't do a good job of helping the at-home exerciser in terms of directional cues. When he should be telling US to kick left because we are facing him as he kicks right, he tells us to kick right. I had a bit of a tough time learning some of the moves because of this but I'm sure I'll pick them up with repetition.Billy is motivational...he both pushes you to achieve AND is understanding that you may not be able to do it all right away. His cooldown on the Cardio DVD is very t'ai chi-like, which I loved...very calming and peaceful. His closing on both DVDs is motivational and empowering--loved it.",N/A

805912,"Well, having finally seen PETER PAN yesterday I can say that I have no ideawhat people are talking about when they refer to the ""sexuality"" in thefilm. I just did not see it.On the other hand, I can see why the film is not doing well at the BoxOffice. It wasn't really good.  While it was certainly more successful thanHOOK and there were parts of it I liked (the final Hook/Pan battle, Petertrying to close the window), the film as a whole did not succeed.I honsetly don't understand why this film is being touted as being more""faithful"" to Barrie's work than other versions.  Certainly the PETER PANmusical videos (Mary Martin and Cathy Rigby and even the long lost MiaFarrow) are FAR more faithful to Barrie's original play, as most of thedialogue in these videos is right out of Barrie's play.  This version wasabout 40% faithful --which in my eyes puts the Disney cartoon (at about 60%faithful) as being more faithful than this one.Some of my problems with the film:1. Tink --I hated her.  I mean HATED her in this version.  Not Tink thecharacter but the way she was portrayed.  I think they were aiming for herto be the equivelance of one of those stupid ""comic animal"" characters thatshow up in almost every Disney cartoon of late (Quasimoto's little gargoylefriends).  They kept cutting to her mugging for comic relief --but shesimply was not funny.2.  The Lost Boys --they were marginalized here.  We never even learnedtheir names until the END of the movie. And what about Slightly's famousline explaining his name ""Slightly Soiled, that's my name"".  Not there!3. There was no segment of the film revealing the life in Neverland. As soonas they arrive the battle with Hook begins.  What about the Piratesfollowing the boys following the indians? What about Michael sleeping in hisbasket?  What about Wendy telling the boys the story of Hamlet? What abouthe Neverbird? Peter being stranded on Marooner's rock? The poison cake? Thehouse in the trees ?  Faithful to Barrie's original?  not even CLOSE!4.  As someone who has been in productions of PETER PAN since  I was 8, Iwas surprised that I found no emotional connection to this film.  Even theending was just BLAH! The whole movie seemed Blah! And I really wanted tolike this movie.5.  Sumpter was good --and his American accent was not as bothersome to meas I thought it would it be.6.  Wend y was very good too.  And I did not mind the ""courting"" of her byHook.  He did this in the play too, though in the play there was no questionthat Hook wanted Wendy to be HIS mother.  In the film you weren't too surewhat he wanted.7.  The score was very HARRY POTTER --especially at the beginning.Well the movie wasn't HORRIBLE but it was not a great film either.  I willbuy the DVD when it comes out and hope for lots of extras and  deletedscenes.  But  I will not be going back to see this film in a movie theater.BTW --the people in the theater with me (about 20 altogether) were not thatthrilled with the film either.  When the Aunt ""adopts"" Slightly some girlsaid, rather loudly, ""This is so STUPID!""  And the kid in front of me wentfor large lengths of time NOT looking at the screen!

515087,"I watched this movie for the second time (I think) last night with my husband and daughter. The R rating is somewhat extreme for this movie. Aside from Kris Kristofferson's characters rampant swearing, this movie could easily be rated PG-13 and then only for frank discussions about sex between the father and daughter. It could actually be considered a good ""coming-of-age"" movie for liberal-minded families, though even those who consider themselves liberal might disagree with the father's philosophy on life and his advice for his fifteen-year-old daughter.  Of course, if you view the story and follow the plot, you might feel that he was compelled to be deliberate and forthright with her. Unlike many fathers, he takes the time to interact with his daughter and have heart-to-heart talks.  This father also takes the time to cultivate his relationship with his wife.  Bill and Marcella obviously have a very passionate relationship, but alcohol use is very prevalent as well. In any case, the movie is intriguing. I especially enjoyed the young seven-year-old Channe played by a beautiful young girl (I don't know her name). The scene in the treehouse with the young French actor is realistic enough to be disturbing and frightening.  Channe's transition into adolescence (now portrayed by LeeLee Sobieski) is very believable.  Her relationship with Francis, also an American, is so frustrating because both characters are so realistic.  You feel the anguish that Channe experiences having a friend whom most young people would shun, and over time, Channe would choose to shun as well.  Francis is one of those people whom you want to like because he's interesting to be around, but unfortunately, he's also so self-deprecating and self-absorbed and whiny that you can't help but dislike him at the same time.  This relationship between Channe and the effeminate, opera-loving Francis might be enough to turn off many viewers.Channe's adopted brother Billy remains an intriguing enigma throughout the movie and certainly his character could have been fleshed out more.  What we gather is that he's sensitive and kind to Channe, but never seems to make friends.  In France, we never see him even interact at school, or even grow into adolescence at home. If this is an autobiographical movie, then one could at times only wonder if Channe and her brother lead isolated lives within the family.  There are moments of connectedness within her family that do dispel this, however.  When Billy arrives with his family in the United States, he seems unhappy and out of place right from the start.  There is the slightest hint that he might be quietly gay, and therefore somewhat repulsed by Francis' blatant personality.  We experience a moment of unrequited connection between him and Channe's American boyfriend.One could find so much to explore within this movie- the interracial relationship between Candida (their Spanish or Portuguese maid who, by the way, has a lovely, siren-like singing voice) and her black boyfriend, Candida's fear of commitment and total devotion to Channe, devotion that leaves her lacking the ability to create her own life.  Barbra Hershey's portrayal of Marcella, a fun-loving wife and mother with no apparent career aspirations,who turns to alcohol to soften life in Paris as an American in the 60's where it's obvious she and her husband and friends often felt out of place.  What's disquieting is that she experiences the same feeling of being an outcast initially when they move back to the United States.Well worth viewing, though some like my husband might watch the movie and ultimately comment ""What's the point?"" (and rightfully so, since everyone is entitled to their own opinion). This is not entertainment for entertainment's sake.  It is an exploration of relationships.",N/A

58190,"""...I get older, they stay the same age!""- David Wooderson (Matt McConaughey), May 1976I was born in 1986, so not only did I not get to experience the '70s, I had to survive crap like Chingy and Nelly and ""sooped-upp rhyz birnurz"" being the dominant pop culture, as opposed to Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd and Chevelles and GTO's. Which is why I love this movie. Next to hearing stories from my parents/uncle, this is as close to the '70s as I'm unfortunately gonna get (unless I'm drivin' a '70s car). It's quite a movie; drugs, booze, rock & roll, and the spirit of '76 rolled up (no pun intended) in one classic comedy!The movie focuses on the last day of school; May 28, 1976 (one decade and one day before I was born). As one I Love The '90s commentator said, it deals with the high of the last day of school, and the high from smoking all the [narcotics] you can. It follows Randall ""Pink"" Floyd, an okay football player, Slater, the druggie we all knew in high school, O'Bannion, the jerk we all knew in high school, and of course, good old Wooderson, the older guy who hangs out with high school kids (and yes, every high school has guys like these). Wooderson's my favorite character; his lines are the best (see the one above). Not to mention he has the movie's COOLEST car, the 375-hp '70 Chevelle SS, ""Melba Toast"". Yeahhhhh.Another great aspect of this movie: THE MUSIC! Foghat, Aerosmith, Edgar Winter, Steve Miller, ZZ Top... great '70s rock! They don't make 'em like that anymore.One day they might make a movie about teenagers in 2004, and I cringe at the thought of it... everybody reminiscing about Lil Jon and little rice burners with huge, tacky spoilers and designs. * shudders * But who cares?

Forget the fact that the monster looks like an actor in heavy ineffectual makeup.  I can accept cheesy horror movies, but none that are so boring as GRIM.  The pacing is superlethargic, and the musical background atrocious.  There were no scares, and only a few unintended laughs.  Like where did Steve get the gong and hammer to play?

784893,"It could have been so much better.  Good special effects, a quite decent concept, good actors, good sets and backgrounds, in general a great feeling to the movie, but the plot suffered a little.  My main complaint was that of charater development, especialy regarding the 2 leads whom were supposed to have some sort of emotional attachment/connection.  The problem was that they never spent enough time, or dialog, together to develop the bonds that were needed by the end to explaine the things.  She was supposed to fall head-over heels for him, give up all she was raised to belive, etc, etc, etc, (don't want to ruin too much if you haven't seen it yet), yet I think she spent more screen time walking though doorways (entrances and exits) than she did with the other romantic lead.  Don't get me wrong, I like Kate Beckinsale in tight leather walking away from the camra as much as the next guy, and I look forward to timming things out when I get the DVD, its just with a little better editing and the addition of a scene or two this movie could have been one of the better ones, and deffinatly would have gottne another star.",N/A

The original versions are still the best, but the expanded versions add more character information and answer questions that diehard fans have asked for years.3) People who weren't huge fans of &quot;Alien 3&quot; or &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; have a new incentive (through restored scenes) to give each another look.4) In addition to newly-made commentary tracks for each film, there's enough special features to choke an elephant.

16988,"Zorro, the hero of Pulps, movies, books, comics and television, has a new movie out.  Antonio Banderas, on Larry King Live, mentioned that he hoped this movie would help to keep alive the spirit of the only Spanish super-hero (he in not the only one nor was he at the time of the interview).  Well, I think it will do much to keep the name alive but not the spirit.Anthony Hopkins is Zorro, the Fox.  After years of struggle, Spain is pulling out of California and leaving it to the Mexicans.  But Zorro slips up and the evil Governor tracks him down, kills his wife, steals his daughter and throws him in prison.  Twenty years later Don Diego (Zorro) hears that the Governor is back.  Minutes later he has escaped from prison (what was he waiting for?) and is destined to run into Antonio Banderas.  After their meeting, Don Diego trains Antonio to be the new Zorro.  The rest of the movie involves the plan to create the Independent Republic of California by buying it from Santa Ana with gold dug out of its soil and stamped to look Spanish.  Mexico is willing to make the sale because of their war with the United States (it is now 1841).If you are looking for a fun swashbuckling adventure, then this is definitely the movie to see.  If, however, you want to see Zorro, you might find yourself a little disappointed.  Gone is Zorro, the defender of the common people and the innocent.  In his place is, not one, but two, Zorro's who are bent on personal vendetta's and enlightened self-interest.  It is actually Don Diego's daughter who helps some enslaved Mexicans near the end of the movie.The transition from one Zorro to another takes the Fox out of the wealthy and privileged and makes him a commoner.  The new Zorro is also a thief (in a wonderfully fun scene the young Zorro steals his horse, a very serious crime at the time).  Having Zorro break so common a law seemed wrong to me.  To have Zorro flaunt the breaking of laws meant to worsen the lives of the commoners is another thing entirely.  But in this movie Zorro does not taunt authority.  He plots against it, to be sure, but for his own reasons and not for the good of the people.As this movie has two Zorros, there are now also two villains to be defeated (one each).  The elder Zorro still has his old nemesis to contend with while the younger Zorro has made a personal enemy of Captain Love, a young Cavalry officer who seems to be in the wrong country.  Both villains are vile and easy to hate.  This make the personal vendettas a little more palatable as well as making the ending a lot more fun.The other main problem with this film is that Zorro loses.  Zorro never loses.  but in this film Zorro loses big time.  He loses his wife, his home, his daughter, his name and twenty years of his life.  Granted, he briefly regains his daughter but gone is the hero who can laugh in the face of danger and triumph brilliantly.The last thing I wanted to mention is that, probably due to the controversy over the new Jeffrey Irons film, Zorro is no longer married to his wife Lolita.  Her name has been changed (how dare they) to the more common Esperanza.  I can understand the concern of some but Don Diego won the heart of Lolita before the Roaring Twenties.  As in the Nabakov novel, Lolita is a valid name before it was turned into an adjective.  Next thing you know people are going to try and get Disney to change the name of Bambi because they think it is a girl's name (Bambi was the prince of the forest).So, if you want to see The Mask of Zorro because, to you, it means an exciting swashbuckling movie, you will really enjoy this one.  But if you want to see the movie to watch the continuing adventures of a hero that has entertained all generations since his debut almost eighty years ago, part of you will be disappointed in what has happened to the character.",N/A
577356,"NOT OF THIS EARTH was a 1988 remake of a 1950s Corman film which was widely touted as the first legitimate role for Traci Lords after she was exposed having been underage in the porn industry.  It's cheesey drive-in fun!  Traci and the cast do a good job with what they have, and the production is fun and never takes itself seriously.  It's about a space vampire who comes to Earth for blood, and he hires a nurse (Traci Lords) and a manservant to help him out.  But they both uncover that he is not what he seems and they try and stop him with some help from their friends.  Nudity and cheesey horror abound, but Traci does not get racier than her infamous blue bikini!The whole thing has b-movie writ large!  You can see camera crews reflected in cars, a portrait moves around the house to EVERY room, and inserted footage from other Corman classics (Galaxy of Terror, Humanoids from the Deep) stand out like sore thumbs.  But for some reason its a hoot, and very enjoyable.  Fans of Traci will love it, and she really shows she can act.  Anyone who can make me believe she's a suspicious nurse of a space vampire deserves the Oscar on effort alone!  Meryl Streep never did that!The extra on the DVD is the commentary by Corman veteran director Jim Wyronski.

782167,"I saw this movie the same day that I saw Million Dollar Baby (the boxing film starring Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood), and at the end all I could think was - is this how I wanted to spend Christmas Eve? Crying?Well, it was worth it.Barry's story is well known, so I'll skip a retelling. Although I never fully understood Barry's interest in Calpernia, only because the movie didn't make any attempts to delve into the ""why"" of his attraction to her, I found myself moved by their love, and Barry's fierce determination to keep his private life (Calpernia) private.What a shame that he shared barracks with such a horrendous and sick person (Justin). I know some people in the armed forces that are gay (but don't ask me who, because I won't tell &lt;grin>), and they are well accepted by their ... I don't know the technical terms here...comrades in arms. How's that. A pity that Barry didn't get stuck with a person whose problem was certainly far worse than OCD.Anyway. What I found particularly moving, and what has caused me to watch the movie again, were the special features on the CD. Usually the special features are interesting for ancillary purposes. But these were different. First, I was surprised to find that Calpernia's [...] weren't real. I had been rather convinced that a real transgender was playing her role. Instead, it was a male, with a rather flat chest, so his performance was even more interesting. That's one of the main reasons I want to watch the film again.Calpernia Adams herself appeared in the Special Features, and I was so surprised. I don't have a tremendous amount of experience with transgenders, but did not expect her to be so much like a lady. NOT a gay man acting like a lady, but a real lady. Her comments on Barry were pointed and poignant. Also, she did have her final operation, and is working now in L.A.The other appearance of note in the Special Features was that of Barry's mother herself. We learned a little more about Barry than in the film. When he first went to Visions, his ""buddies"" were taking him there to get his mind off his breakup with his girlfriend of four years. She wondered if Barry was actually gay, but said that it didn't matter. What mattered is that what happened to him was a terrible crime, one of bigotry and hate, and so she and her husband have taken it upon themselves to speak when and wherever they can to combat closed minds. Good for them.There were only two things that angered me. One, the person that killed Barry will be eligible for parole in less than thirteen years. The manner in which he killed Barry should have garnered him life imprisonment without the possibility of parole - at best. Also, the instigator of his death, Justin, is up for parole very soon. If not for his pressuring, the little idiot (Glover?) that killed Barry probably wouldn't have done it. If the movie showed that scene correctly, as it actually happened, then Justin is just as responsible for Barry's death as Glover, and should be in prison for a very long time.*Added 9/29/06 - According to the October 10th, 2006 issue of The Advocate, ""Justin Fisher...was [released] to a halfway house [last month]. Fisher will be out of custody entirely October 24.""He didn't spend nearly enough time for this crime. How horribly, horribly sad.",N/A
352993,"The Last Unicorn, released in 1982, was drawn from the novel by Peter S. Beagle. I believe considerable license was taken. This movie I saw as a little boy in the 80's long before DVD when there was only VHS. VHS. What's that some younger kids would say today. At the time, made this movie very life-like and a bit scary, especially the scenes of the Red Bull. This animated movie uses early techniques of Japanese anime as Japanese animators had to do with the making of the film. It's a fantasy epic with an easy to follow plot but a bit slowed down by musical sequences- the Butterfly with the Elton John glasses and even Mia Farrow gets to sing although her singing voice is not going to win a Grammy.Mia Farrow stars as the voice of the Unicorn. She starts off on a quest to find out what happened to the other unicorns since she has been told she is the last unicorn. On her way, she encounters a witch (played by Angela Landsbury in a performance far from Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast) who showcases her in a traveling circus show. She pairs up with the amateur wizard Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) and aging village woman Molly on a discovery trip further into the magical land. The truth is finally revealed when the hellish Red Bull tries to take the Unicorn away. The unicorn is temporarily transformed into the Princess Amalthea. Prince Lear (Jeff Bridges) falls in love with her, much to the disapproval of his father the old and dismal King Haggard (played superbly by Christopher Lee of the Dracula films and the recent Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones). King Haggard has employed the services of The Red Bull who drove the unicorns into the sea, just to please the old king. I don't think this is motive enough and this is where the story lacked substance for me. What kind of a silly king would want to see unicorns in the sea ?

822120,"&quot;Spartan&quot; is the eighth film written and directed by playwright David Mamet. It stars Val Kilmer as a elite secret agent with paramilitary training who does dirty work for various U.S. Government agencies. He goes by the name of Mr. Scott, but we're led to believe that's not his real name. When the President's daughter disappears from her college campus, apparently kidnapped, Mr. Scott is assigned to assist the Secret Service in finding her. They have only two days to find and retrieve Laura Newton (Kristen Bell) before the news media get ahold of the story. Scott tracks her down. A rescue mission is planned. But things aren't as they appear.&quot;Spartan&quot; is not an adrenaline-pumping thriller. It's more of a puzzle. It's filmed in a shadowy, brooding style. A surprising number of scenes take place at night. &quot;Spartan&quot; presents an extremely cynical view of politics and power, which might be interesting if the story made any sense. Not only does the story not make sense, the dialogue doesn't either. It's conspicuously unnatural and consistently nonsensical. I think Val Kilmer's timing is poor in a few places, but it's hard to tell, because the lines are cringe-inducing anyway. Derek Luke and Tia Texada give the most memorable performances as young rookie agents Curtis and Black. I'm giving &quot;Spartan&quot; three stars for the cinematography by Juan Ruiz Anchia. I like the way this film looks. But the writing is just plain bad.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by Val Kilmer and a theatrical trailer. Don't watch the trailer before the movie. It's full of spoilers. The audio commentary is interesting in spots but a little frustrating because it meanders and contains a lot of long pauses. Kilmer also frequently doesn't comment on the scene that he's looking at. It's very stream-of-consciousness. It gives more insight into Val Kilmer than into the film, so I would recommend it for his fans only.",N/A
51019,"I'm not going to praise this movie to death, we all know it has its problems here and there.  But, we all must keep in mind that &quot;popcorn movies&quot; still exist.  I realize that the original JP had economical and moral undertones, but in the end, it was intentionally a goofy monster movie (and I'd like to believe that Speilberg would say the same).  This series of films is one of the more enjoyable in recent memory, simply because it has not lost sight of what it was.  I personally don't mind saying that Michael Crichton's source material is a step down from this movie.  That's right, a step down.  I have read three of his novels (JP, Lost World, and Congo) and have been deeply disappointed in his style and his narrative.  I like the technical portions of the novels, but when you dedicate that much time to revel in such tired, meandering literature, you expect a whole lot more.  Having said that, the film, I believe, would be worth a shot at (ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OL' DTS AUDIO TRACK).  Heck, I'll be buying it sooner or later just for the DVD transfer.",N/A
788881,"I suppose, since I bought this DVD as soon as it became available that I have finally become a true Eva-Otaku.  After all, I already own the DVD set and the films.  Somehow, though, I've never thought of myself as one.  I find Evangelion a fascinating artistic effort, one that manages to cross cultural lines even as it creates something uniquely Japanese.  But I haven't memorized the scripts yet.  But in absorbing this new DVD I discovered that I'm still not tired of watching the episodes.A lot of director's cuts really are just collections of deleted material pasted back on.  With some frequency, the cuts were made for a valid reason.  On occasion, the cuts were made to accomplish something arbitrary (to get a better rating or meet a length requirement).  That is the case here.  These episodes represent a return to Hideaki Anno's original concept for the series and provide considerable insight into the confusions of the first US release.Episode 21 has been filled out considerably, providing a better picture of the progression that led to the birth of the Evangelions and the inception of NERV.  While most of the information can be gleaned elsewhere, this makes the story gel for the view.  You will immediately become aware that you are watching a redubbed Japanese product, not a re-localized cut (which is what the original release was.  This creates a bit of visual confusion until you adjust, but actually presents considerable new information, as many of the subtitles are different or new.Unfortunately, is also becomes apparent that the entire production has been redubbed and John Swasey has replaced Tristan MacAvery as Gendo Akari.  While it isn't Swasey's fault, the acting lacks the edge of the first release, and sometimes the dubbing proceeds on blindly, paying no attention to changes in the subtitles or the Japanese.  Minor annoyances when you consider the improved clarity of the episodes.Episode 22 is the first indication that something major has happened.  The material reintroduced to the episode focuses on Asuka's development as a character.  Introductory material about he has been added, and the fight scene where she suffers a breakdown and failure has been significantly changed.  Anno makes much use of echoing images in the series, but what we discover is that the released cut greatly reduced his artistic contribution.  With al this restored the story leaps to life as it never had before.Episode 23 continues in this vein.  Although the changes are not so dramatic as in 22, Rei's fight scene has also been expanded internally, some material has also been deleted including a bit of brief nudity that also refocuses the intense of another scene.  In fact, many of the cuts originally made in both 22 and 23 were made to diffuse some of the latent sexuality of the invasions of both Asuka's and Rei's psyche's.  In retrospect, this is a surprising discovery, since Evangelion has always been aimed at a young adult audience, and there is nothing particularly offensive in the new versions.Both versions of the episodes are provided so save popping DVD's in and out.  The only additional material is a 15-minute marketing interview about the Evangelion live action film that raises as many misgivings as it does interest.If the remaining episodes in the director's cut series are as changed as these were then this is required viewing.  Hideaki Anno's work opens up layers of Evangelion that previously were obscure tot he viewer, especially the English language viewer.  I would recommend tracking them down even if you are only a casual watcher of anime.  If you have become an Eva-Otaku then ownership is both required and a delight.",N/A
839252,"There are things about this movie that I really liked, and things that I really hated.  First let me say that when I first heard the movie was being directed by Stephen Sommers, I was really excited.  The 1999 Universal movie ""The Mummy"" was absolutely fantastic.  It stayed true to the original classic, but added in awesome special effects and a lot of humor.  I think that was a truly epic monster movie, it's sequel not falling far behind in terms of greatness.Anyhow, now we come to ""Van Helsing"".  When the official website for the movie opened, I couldn't have been more pleased.  The shadowy pictures of each of the 3 monsters had me jumping out of my seat, they looked so awesome.  Being a huge fan of the classic Universal Monster movies, I was happy someone had finally decided to do a decent remake of the three monsters featured in this film.  Most of the 90's versions of Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Wolf Man (with the exception of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", which was excellent) were really lacking.  Then finally when the trailer was released for Van Helsing, it was looking better than ever.And after many months of waiting, I finally sat down in a theater to watch Van Helsing.  I was greatly disappointed.  First of all, this movie did not stay true to the original movies at all.  It actually rewrote the birth of Frankenstein.  Sure, many of the same elements existed (the castle, an angry mob, the windmill, etc.), but the story was just wrong.  Dracula was never meant to be present at the Frankensteins' Monster's birth, and Dr. Frankenstein was meant to be a mad scientist, not some symbol of good.Next we come to Van Helsing himself.  Who exactly is the person portrayed in the movie?  He's obviously not Abraham Van Helsing, as portrayed in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", but some descendant.  And why does he have to be working for the church, which only comes into play for about five minutes of the movie anyhow?  And quite frankly I don't see why Mr. Hyde had to be stuck in the movie either.  The Mr. Hyde in this movie was a complete rip off of the one in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"".  I personally, would have chosen a different monster, maybe the Gill Man or something more common in the classic Universal realm.  Anyway, I didn't particularly like Hugh Jackman as the hero either.  Don't get me wrong, Hugh Jackman is an awesome actor, but he's already Wolverine in ""X-Men"", and seeing as this movie is obviously some type of superhero story, I think they should have went with someone less popular.  And the whole ""right hand of God"" theme was really lame.Next we come to The Wolf Man (my favorite monster).  First, I'm glad someone was finally able to make a decent werewolf movie, as the past few years have not seen many, but I do have some complaints.  I think the ""first"" werewolf to appear in the movie, the one to bite Velkan, was the best one featured.  The gray fur, and the overly large fangs looked magnificent.  And the way the creature moved was great.  But the Velkan werewolf wasn't as good, in my opinion.  It looks too much like a puppy, not nearly as feirce as the first werewolf.  Yeah, I know, it's one of the good guys who has turned into the wolf, but still it could be a little meaner.  I didn't care for the transformation sequence either.  The idea of a man tearing off his skin and revealing a wolf underneath is awesome, but its was carried out too PG-13 friendly in the movie.  You need to show the guy actually tearing his flesh away, not blend the shedding skin with the metamorphosis.  And I don't really understand the fact that when the werewolf turns back into Velkan, it also tears its skin off.  The whole idea kind of contradicts itself.  And finally, and I don't want to give away too much, but the ""final"" werewolf in the film was mean looking too, but it's fur was too dark, and it made the creature hard to make out.  Not to mention the monster's face resembles that of a black lab.Finally we come to Dracula.  I don't think the character was carried out too well, honestly.  Dracula is meant to be evil and at the same time partially compassionate for his love, not funny.  It's good to have humor, but did Imhotep make jokes in ""The Mummy""?  And I also didn't care too much for the fact that Van Helsing encountered Dracula before, and the whole ""offspring"" idea was a cheaply thought out excuse to bring the monsters together.One last comment, what was the point of that Transylvanian guy with the top hat?  He had really lame jokes, and basically no purpose to the plot whatsoever.  I was glad to see him taken out by Velkan.  On the other hand, I think Kevin J. O'Connor added a great deal to the movie as ""Igor"", just as he did to ""The Mummy"".  He would have been satisfactory as the film's comic relief, but for some reason they had to make Dracula ""funny"", and add that goofy Carl guy for additional humor (a waste.)So finally, the special effects were excellent, and overall the movie is very entertaining, but I just think too much money was wasted on the project.  If they wanted to remake these monsters so bad, they should have done each one seperately, and if they wanted to make a movie with these three monsters so bad, they should have done it a little more seriously, and stayed true to the original stories.  Van Helsing is basically just a seriously overproduced mix between ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Howling VI"".",N/A
771325,A great adaption of a great comic series.  The story line does not completely follow the comic book but what changes are done don't affect the story.It is a rarity where the sequal is better then the original and that is what you have here.  The cast pretty well fits the comic characters well I don't care for Hally but that is just me.  Hugh has the wolverine down perfect!  Nightcrawler is an excelent addition to the story line and I can't wait for see what they do when Jean becomes the Phoenix.  You are also introduced to Collosus!  The only wrong thing that may have happened is the fact he sounded American.You don't have to worry about not seeing the first movie as you get follow the basic plot.  There are a couple references but it is not enough to leave you confused.Overall it is a fun film and you won't get bored watching it again and again....The extras on the DVD are ok.Can't wait for the next movie!,N/A
284183,"Charles Laughton's ""The Night of the Hunter"" is one of the most notable atmospheric films ever made. One wonders what other works may have followed had Laughton decided to further pursue a career in directing. The dream-like visuals he employed in ""The Night of the Hunter"" were groundbreaking, beautiful, haunting, and breathtaking all at the same time.Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) arrives in a small town one day with the letters H-A-T-E and L-O-V-E tattooed on his knuckles. Powell has learned of $10,000 in hidden money which was stolen by a man who used to live in the town. Seeking out the man's widow, Willa Harper (Shelley Winters), Powell hopes to find the hidden money and keep it for himself. The widow's two children, John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) know the location of the money but refuse to tell the mysterious preacher where it is. So begins a cat-and-mouse game between Powell and the children.Laughton was ahead of his time in making such effective use of visual imagery. The shadows and lighting he employed added deeper layers of meaning to the proceedings. Especially noteworthy are the moments in the bedroom set and the shot depicting Willa Harper's final fate - both scenes still astonish to this day. When the children drift down the river while escaping from Powell, the wonder and darkness of nature is filmed in so graceful, mysterious, and absorbing a manner that one is reminded of the techniques of modern-day directors Terrence Malick and Tim Burton. Mitchum is amazing in what is easily the best performance of his carreer. Child actors Chapin and Bruce are also great as is Winters in a tragic role. The inclusion of screen legend Lillian Gish in the second half of the film is only icing on the cake for an already impressive production.",Night of the Hunter VHS
848847,"After seeing Croupier, a previous collaboration between director Mike Hodges and actor Clive Owen, I was really looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is simply a bad movie. Where to start- how about the homophobic undercurrent prevalent throughout the movie? According to this movie, the worse fate in the world is to be raped and the only logical answer is suicide. This movie is so rote and by-the-book, with absolutely no suspense or build up, that it felt like I was watching a graduate student film. Clive Owen, usually a fantastic actor, possibly does TOO GOOD a job during this movie, underacting to the point of practically sleepwalking through the part; Charlotte Rampling is wasted in her role while Malcolm McDowell ACTS as if he were wasted (on booze, that is).

573547,"Judgement, another film by Cloud Ten picture, continues the story of Helen Hannah and her band of freedom fighters and their battle against anti-christ. This one also stars Corbin Benson and Mr T!!The christians, who are labelled as haters, are set-up by the ungodly government of the time as being terrorists and are tried in court for their hate-crimes. The trial soon takes a turn when the anti-christ decides to put God on trial! The film then becomes a court room drama and is very interesting to watch.What really strikes me about this movie is the way the christians are labelled as ""haters"" and how this resembles the world we live in today. In my country there is currently a court case in progress where some ministers are being labelled as ""haters"" because they are preaching the gospel and managed to offend some people. This is only happening because of a ""religious tolerance law"" that has been passed here of recent times. It seems that tolerance only goes one way though, be tolerant of all religions except christianity is the order of the day.

Well, to be honest, I loved this movies...when I was 8 years old, but time flies fast, and things change.""Police Academy 3: Back In Training"" is a collection of racial stereotypes, cliched characters, unfunny jokes, one dimensional performances and bad direction. Most of the actors could only get a job in the ""Police Academy"" series, and that is mostly their fault, because if they had chosen different roles, they could still be acting today in movies...I guess.Perhaps I'm being unfair, ""Police Academy 3: Back In Training"" is not that bad...to see only once.

720342,"It's in many ways not fair to entitle this film as just a film noir.I state that because , first at all remember. we are talking about of Patricia Highsmith , one of the most gifted minds in the north american literatute. If you analyze all her literaries works, as Strangers on a train,(Hitchcock) or A plenn soleil(Rene Clement), you'll find all the characters are envolved in a cosmical trick. It's true that the hopeless who surrounds establishes an anticipated fate in all their actions. But what Highsmith adds in every work, including the american friend is the lack of any kind of feeling or ethical consideration carried to a level that they become in models. I mean, it's very hard for us to find by instance, with a character as Mr. Rippley in any street of any city in the world. These characters are not common.That's the most remarkable virtue in Highsmith and Wenders so Clement and Hithcock understood and exploited this item like few.Wenders,one of the three kings of the german filmography in the seventies, (together with Fassbinder, Herzog, and Hauff), knew how to deal with that and make a clever twist in an age where the key works of the neo film noir, a genre that slowly was left and replaced by thrillers with little trascendence.This film , in my point of view, made grow up to Dennis Hopper, not only as actor, but as a filmmaker. (Remember his best work as director titled Colors).This film is eternal. And that means just one thing: it's a masterpiece. And obviously, it will resist the years and far of getting old, it will enrich us, every time we watch it.",The American Friend

617084,"The so called 'Rednecks' must either be very good sports, or don't go to movies much, or both! If Hollywood is to be believed, over and over..and over again, they are the last people on earth you want to invite over for dinner or the very least avoid at all costs being stranded in their backyard. Mostly they are portrayed as not very smart, with a dislike to anyone whose warts are not visible, have a dentistry phobia, and who take the phrase' family ties' too closely to heart.But perhaps the film that should have made any decent 'Redneck' run to his local PR firm  fast was of course John Boorman's Deliverance. Their world was painted as beautiful but harsh and dangerous, and in a way as alien as any rock on Mars to the clean, educated, smart, rich and successful folks from the East or West, who just happen either to be lost or enjoying a holiday without the hassle of wanting anyone around.Many films have followed suit, and it became a sort of good material for any producer who wishes to add a bit of horror and suspense to his/her movie, from the crazy creoles in Southern Comfort, the loopy family with a taste for 'meat' in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the nasty kidnappers in Breakdown, the psycho trucker in JoyRide to the newest of the lot, Wrong Turn.Four young and beautiful people take, er..quite predictably a wrong turn, and end up lost in the woods at the mercy of three crazed mutated psychos (due to generations of inbreeding so we are to believe).The film itself is not bad, in a sort of ' bland and not adding anything to its genre' way. There is suspense and gore for the enthusiasts ,and the ubiquitous final scene that has been milked to excess in every horror movie post Carrie, the resurrection of the monster/killer for one final assault!!What works for the film is its length, and at 80 minutes it finishes just at a time when your fingers itch for the fast forward.The acting was mixed though: Buffy's Eliza Dushku and Six Feet Under's Jeremy Sisto do a decent job, while the lovely Emmaneulle Chriqui 's distress and tears are as convincing as those of a TV Evangelist.My three stars though are for the WAY OVER THE TOP the make up people made the three psychos to look like.I mean generations of inbreeding will have one greeting his hand every morning, but these guys's ancestors seemed to have bred with moles! They really look like extras fresh from the Lord of the Rings!!Anyway,I thought it would be nice to watch a movie one day about a group of 'Rednecks' being stranded in some big city and chased block after block by some insurance salesmen!!This will make a fresh twist, but I guess not good movie material..So Wrong Turn is an average horror film that I am sure will not disappoint many, but remains in my opinion, one that you can only watch once if you have nothing better to do, and certainly not 'movie library' material.",N/A

The landlord's rules are: 3 days late=triple the rent and Fool's family cannot afford it.

With a couple of tricks up their sleeves, the trio sets out to the house using various disguises such as a plumber (Spencer) and a Little Bear Trooper (Fool). Only Spencer is allowed inside and even he doesn't make it out alive.

This is the reason that I can't stand B5. Some of the graphics are so horribly bad, it leaves you wondering.I must state though, that I really enjoyed this whole set, and  watched many episodes twice (later on). They are infinitely better than B5, even with the occasional reversion to the same Boring Banter between captains; constantly Talking and COMPLAINING. The weight, the difficulties, the bla bla bla. That's all they ever give to Tracy Scoggins (in the Crusade series), lines about how hard it is to be a captain. They even dedicated a whole episode to Tracy Complaining About The Universe, so Gideon boinks her. Most of the characters are solid and interesting, especially Galen. There is alot of entertainment here, even if you hated B5 as I did. But you must see the Pilot episode to appreciate CRUSADE. I watched a few on TV and had no idea what was going on, so did'nt follow it.

This movie is visually breathtaking and wonderfully original. It celebrates the little quirks in life and in people. That's how the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film is opened, with a quick rundown of all the things these characters love and hate and how those things define who they are.To warn you all, this film is not for everyone. It is not the standard hollywood type of story. But if you are ready for something different and something uplifting this movie would be for you. I myself was caught off guard and loved it.",Amelie
798993,"The two sequels to THE MATRIX have the same problem.  Sure, they are pretty much equally entertaining, but only the sum of some parts.  The WACHOWSKI's spent too much time in smokey rooms worrying about the phiosophical aspects of their project, and didn't realize the best parts of the original MATRIX were the FX heavy action sequences.  Hey, I'm as critical of plotting and story importance as anyone, but the draw of these B sci-fi flicks is the mayhem.  The battle for ZION is the best thing here, the special effects are simply amazing.  The story is weak.  What actually transpires at the end and why is very up-in-the-air, and seems rather rushed.  Although visually superior to almost anything out there, THE MATRIX series goes out with a dud, fully due to weak story.  Here's MY philosophy; why not make a film with an excellent sci-fi adventure story AND wicked FX?  As with RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS one can be decently satisfied with the one aspect, which is decent enough to like it.",N/A

Ethan Hawke stammers so many times you wonder if he cracked his head getting off the Metro and addled his brains.  Julie Delpy is so old looking, worn out and haggerdy.  Her character's frequent soapboxing is tired too.I don't see much between these characters.  Clearly Julie Delpy's character is deeper, more introspective.  She challenge's Ethan Hawke's character several times, and all he can do is stammer and leer.Ethan is married, yet he is obviously more than ready to fling his committments aside and make a little French Connection (pardon the pun).  This is disturbing.  I mean, it is not like these two characters had some sort of deep or long lasting relationship.  They met briefly, talked, flirted, and drifted apart.  Now, ten years later, he is willing to throw aside his responsibilities for her.The movie is mostly about talk.  Talk, talk, talk.  Mostly Julie Delpy's character blathering on and on and on and on about life and wicked imperialistic nations like....America.WARNING TO AMERICANS:  If a single patriotic cell exists inside your body, you may not want to rent, watch, or buy this movie.  Before Sunset is just another attempt by the left-wing, America-hating Movie Industry to stir up anti-American sentiments.  In this pathetically lousy flick, they cast the United States of America in the role of BIG BAD OPRESSOR, Land of Rape and Murder (watch for Julie Delpy's character's little ""boo-hoo, sniff-sniff"" speech early in the film about how she, the poor little sheltered French girl trembled with fear during a visit to America (where people are raped and abused by the police).  Her little diatribe about how an American policeman waved a gun about and basically threatened her was ridiculous and nauseating.The film makes it look like Paris is a haven, a cosmopositan but quaint world-class city with no crime, and New York City is a cesspool of murder and rape.  Interesting, considering the following statistics found on the International Crime Statistics Comparison website:Here are Interpol 2001 crime statistics (rate per 100,000):4161 - US7736 - Germany6941 - France9927 - England and WalesThus the US has a substantially lower crime rate than the major European countries!Here are the Interpol 1995 crime statistics (rate per 100,000):5278 - US8179 - Germany6316 - France7206 - England & WalesBesides the clearly WE HATE AMERICA, THE BIG BAD OPRESSIVE IMPERIALISTIC NATION message, the film just. . . sucks Seine water.I am a bonafide Francophile and adore France, but I am also a patrotic American.

The most shocking violence occurs near the end, which I will not spoil for anyone intending to see the film.

However, that being said, I was a bit disappointed that the story, in places, stretched my credibility. Yes, I know that sounds crazy, going to see a film about a guy that turns into a spider and I'm complaining about having my credibility stretched. But listen, if I'm going to accept a premise, say that it's possible that some guy could turn into a ?spider-man?, at least I want the story to stay in the borders its created and not push it even further.The acting was good, the love story well done enough for the genre and all in all I was entertained and enjoyed the movie, however, I'm still sticking with the same assessment that I gave the first movie, it's just an average adventure story with great special effects.",Spider-Man 2
23601,"This DVD is a collection of 15 Pas de deux covering a time span of 31 years. (1965-1996). It includes such well know ballet stars as Nureyev, Baryshnikov, Makhalina, and Asylmuratova to mention a few.The entire compilation tries to focus on presenting the performers when they were in their prime. For instance the segment featuring Nureyev and Fonteyn was recorded in 1965 and although the picture is a little grainy, it is more than adequate to give us a glimpse of what these artists could do when they were at their best.Some of my favorite pieces were...- Spring Waters with Maria Bylova and Leonid Nikonov; with their fast paced,energetic leaps and lifts.- Romeo and  Juliet (balcony scene) with Alessandra Ferri and Wayne Eagling; an early example of Ferri's  acting and interpretation skills that we would continue to see develop, in the years to follow.- Swan Lake (Black Swan scene) with Julia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky; Makhalina show us (as Odile) just how poised, incredibly flexible and talented she really is in this role. She is simply stunning.-and last but not least the Don Quixote pas de deux with Cynthia Harvey and Mikhail Baryshnikov. This features some of Baryshnikov's world famous leaps and spins. Enough said!There were a couple of segments that I didn't enjoy as some of the others; but that would to be expected in a &quot;sampling&quot; of a series of pas de deux. Also a couple of dancers and choreographers were featured multiple times(3); this I found a little puzzling on a relatively short, one disc recording.An enjoyable DVD and although the video quality my change a bit from one performance to the next, you still have to feel grateful just being able to watch and appreciate some of the greatest dancers of the last century.",N/A
366276,"""Return of the Vampire"" (1943) is an underrated, atmospheric chiller that surpasses the missed opportunities of ""Dracula."" Unlike Tod Browning, director Lew Landers gives Bela Lugosi a terrific showcase as vampire Armand Tesla. The World War II setting works quite well and the script is surprisingly intelligent. There are moments in ""Return of the Vampire"" that evoke a Val Lewton quality in terms of mood and character development. Lugosi, in particular, effectively underplays his role - complemented by a fine cast. Columbia Pictures made relatively few horror films during the 1930s and '40s, yet ""Return of the Vampire"" remains the studio's finest contribution to the genre.",Return of the Vampire VHS
608223,"Another dark figure haunting since Draclinghood from the shelves of comic book fane, Dare Devil {played by Ben Affleck} travels high above through the night like some red demon, casting his fearsome shadow upon criminal wastrels throughout the concrete jungle.Dare Devil is blinded by nuclear waste as a child, although the very same chemical which plunged him into eternal darkness also embued him with heightened senses. He derives his nomenclature and inspiration from a wrestling mentor who was murdered in a back alley by a sore-loser after a match, which then placed him on the road to the dark justice of vigilanteism. He subsequently becomes a lawyer, earning his degree by using braille to excel, and sets out to avenge a rape victim against a lowlife who gets away scott-free...or so he thought. He eventually meets up with &quot;Elektra Nasches&quot; {which in the movie sounds rather like &quot;electric nachos&quot;}, and after a spirited battle after exiting a restaurant in which he desires to date her, she marvels at his skills despite being a blind man, and eventually do begin to date.&quot;Bullseye&quot; eventually appears, a bald hoodlum-type with target scarification on his forehead, who utilizes deadly metal spikes to make his point.

794299,"If you haven't seen &quot;The Rundown&quot;, you're probably wondering about how good it really is. Prior to viewing - what are your expectations? You can look at this movie in two ways: One - as a big blockbuster action flick with the WWF's &quot;The Rock&quot; and all kinds of incredible fight scenes, an incredible story, bombs going off, and the bad guys getting what they deserve. Or two, have no expectations at all. I feel that if you go into &quot;The Rundown&quot; with high expectations thinking Dwayne Johnson will be the next &quot;Terminator&quot;, &quot;Commando&quot;, or &quot;Predator&quot;... you might be let down. However, I went into this movie with NO expectations. I've never been a fan of the WWF and the only thing I've seen The Rock in was the &quot;Mummy Returns&quot; (and was unimpressed with him and his claymation double). I watched some of the behind-the-scenes features before the actual movie and was pleasantly surprised at the Rock's smarts, athleticism, (Hawaiian) charsima and sense of humor. I never knew the Rock was such a smart, let alone a funny guy. As for co-star Seann William Scott - he remained true to his other well known characters...a bit obnoxious and often funny at times. The other shock in this movie was director Peter Berg. I had no idea this guy could direct! I only remember Berg from Copland (&quot;Joey&quot;), and probably more so as Corky Romano's illiterate brother &quot;Paulie&quot;. Don't look for an incredible plot here; &quot;The Rundown&quot; is a very simple story. &quot;Beck&quot; (The Rock) is a &quot;Professional Retriever&quot; or bounty hunter. He wants to retire from the mobster for whom he works for and with his last big pay-off, open a restaurant where he can be the chef. The mobster's son &quot;Travis&quot; (Scott) is deep in the jungles of South America and is mixed up with some of the wrong people (namely &quot;Hatcher&quot;, played nicely by Christopher Walken). It's Beck's job to bring Travis back home to Los Angeles. The trip home is a long one and there's some great action, explosions, jeeps going off the road and the stars tumbling down a mountain side, fight scenes, monkeys going ape, etc. The opening scene (prior to Beck hitting the jungles) takes place in Los Angeles. Beck has to confront a football quarterback with a betting problem. As Beck walks into the night club he passes many people (one being Arnold Schwarzenegger in his shortest movie role ever). Beck finds the QB, but he's surrounded by his entire offensive line (and they're huge). The QB won't cooperate, and Beck whists thru these larger-than-life guys one by one while the strobe lights flicker and the music blazes... a great scene! Only thing out of reach in this movie was some of the stunts where you just knew the actors in the fight scenes were on &quot;wires&quot;. Sure, they were fun to watch, but you knew they were physically impossible - even for The Rock. Go into this movie expecting nothing and you'll get much more out of this movie. I was entertained... I found &quot;The Rundown&quot; had a good pace (I never looked down at my watch), plenty of action, great fights, some good stunts, and good dialogue between the characters (humorous and not).",N/A

I saw the last tour and the acoustic set was one of the highlights.  The guys should consider rearranging many of their classics in this format and taking this on tour.

It's a very interesting and funny movie.The one drawback was that while it is interesting to have two stories going on with the characters- one being real life, the other being a story Luke's character, Alex made up with actual realities-was that sometimes it could get a little confusing because I think the real life story should have had a little more time to develop.Kate always delivers fantastic movies so I wasn't surprised at how well and convincing her acting was in this movie.Luke also did a great job of portraying the character of Alex. Very convincing!The actors are great, the story is cute, and it's just one of those movies you can sit back and watch and have a good time!The extras on this DVD were not that great considering there were not very many, but the commentary would be better if Kate Hudson had been in it.This may not win any awards but it is a sweet film none the less!",N/A

229118,"Fists Of Fury represents Bruce Lee's introduction into the martial arts movie genre. After getting shunned by Hollywood, he went back to Hong Kong and teamed with Raymond Chow (a movie producer). This first film in the Bruce Lee collection is much more raw and low budget than the others. It's also quite cheesy watching it 23 years later. But it has Bruce Lee in it. And he kicks ass. What else do you need to know?The story goes that Bruce comes to a small town that some of his cousins live in. He moved there to escape the fights and problems he was having in his old town. Of course, he will find some trouble in his new surroundings soon enough. He spends the first half of the movie NOT fighting, due to a promise he once made his mother. He gets a job at a Thailand ice factory. He and his mates find that it is a front for a drug smuggling operation. Once his friends start disappearing, he investigates. And that is where the movie really kicks in.I must admit, the movie is quite low budget and cheesy. Once Bruce starts beating everyone in sight, however, it gets really good. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is even worse. You will also notice some Hong Kong movie staples that could never happen in real life. Like the bad guy lightly tossing a birdcage up in the air and it hooking itself on to a tree branch. Then Bruce chucks a knife up and hits the cage, it falls and breaks and the birds escape. When you see this, it will make you wonder how the hell this cheesy movie made money. Then when Bruce's fists and feet start flying, you will know. This film is built around Bruce and Bruce alone. If you can get past the fact that it's quite dated looking, poorly acted, and has a terrible script, you will enjoy it. Kick back and watch Bruce in his first role that would make him a god in many people's eyes for years to come.The DVD has no extras whatsoever.

395878,"Destination Moon was the first major technicolor motion picture produced in the United States dealing with a trip to the moon, and the first serious, big budget science fiction film. Robert A. Heinlein (author of Starship Troopers, The Puppet Masters, Stranger in A Strange Land, and Space Cadet) co-wrote the screenplay very loosely from his 1947 novel Rocketship Galileo, although about all that remains unchanged in the film is the name Dr. Cargraves. In the book there is a veiled threat from unknown enemies that turn out to be Nazis (this was the first thing Heinlein wrote after the war) - in the film there's just a veiled reference to a communist threat. I suspect the film also draws from Heinlein's more sophisticated treatment from the same period, The Man Who Sold The Moon.  The film's suspenseful and scientifically accurate plot depicts man's first voyage to and landing on the Moon, and the dangers of outer space travel. A Woody Woodpecker cartoon is included to demonstrate the principles of rocketry.George Pal's first science fiction film (earlier he had done Puppetoons and The Great Rupert), Destination Moon earned an Academy Award for Special Effects. Later Mr. Pal would produce more science fiction classics including When World's Collide, War Of The Worlds, and The Time Machine.  Photographed in  Technicolor with an original musical score by Leith Stevens and stunning artwork by Chesley Bonestell, Destination Moon is a milestone in special effects and a classic in the science fiction genre.It is said that this film was shown to President Eisenhower to persuade him to support the pre-NASA space programs. On 6 October 1988, after the Robert Heinlein's death, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awarded him the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal:""In recognition of his meritorious service to the Nation and mankind in advocating and promoting the exploration of space. Through dozens of superbly written novels and essays and his epoch-making movie Destination Moon, he helped inspire the Nation to take its first step into space and onto the Moon. Even after his death, his books live on as testimony to a man of purpose and vision, a man dedicated to encouraging others to dream, explore and achieve."" -- James C.

819840,"""Touching the Void"" is a partly re-enacted documentary of a climb of the western face of the Siula Grande in Peru in 1985.  The details of the climb make for a fine and gripping film.The brief details of the climb of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates is that their ascent is relatively straight forward despite the mountain being more technically difficult than they had expected.  It on the descent that problems really began.  Firstly and, obviously, critically, Simpson slipped on an ice ledge and smashed right leg.  The only piece of good fortune being that no bone penetrated the skin.  It was thus left to Yates to assist his partner to the base camp.At this point, matters deteriorated further when Yates was forced to cut their connecting rope when Simpson had fallen over a cliff and was in danger of dragging his partner with him.  Yates then proceeded to climb down having realistically left Simpson for dead.  However, by a combination of luck and supreme courage, Simpson too made the descent but in a truly battered state.  He had, for example, lost one third of his body weight!Upon the climbers return to their native England, Yates was apparently criticised for cutting Yates loose.  Simpson never joined this criticism but only praised Yates for his efforts.The film is a re-enactment of the heroism of the two climbers.  It outlines to all that mountain climbing is a dangerous past time that only the foolish and/or the brave can contemplate.  The film should be seen by all if only for the wonderful telling of a story of heroism within a vast, magnificent and unforgiving landscape.",Touching the Void

We get a glimpse into their lives during a whirlwind weekend when the summer carnival has come to town and love is in the air.  The love interests are a young blonde sailor who falls in love with Delphine's likeness in a painting (his ""female ideal""--the accompanying song is a hilarious and dizzyingly lovesick), and Andy Miller (Gene Kelly--dubbed over by a jazz singer's voice) who encounters Solange in the street, by chance.  Also, let's not forget the appearance of George Chakiris as Etienne, a fancy free carny who basically is living loose and free (and finds time to dance and showcase the newest model of motorcycle during the fair).This is truly a period piece.  Some of the costumes are a real throwback to 1960s mod--complete with go-go boots and tight jeans.  The choreography is funky, edgy and definitely not from your grandmother's musicals.  (I don't think this would've been Fred Astaire's first choice for a ""cross over"" film.)  Rent this when you want a great escape from the burdens of day to day life.  This will definitely lift your spirits!",The Young Girls of Rochefort VHS
619050,"My initial review of this film was scathing to say the least.  I still don't like it and my feelings can be pretty much summed up above in my review title.  I found out from another Amazon reader that the writer-director Francis Ozon is actually an out-of-the-closet gay male.  I was surprised because I felt his film screamed ""heterosexual male wet dream"".  I honestly didn't find much in this film that was homo-erotic.  Did I miss something?  I suppose there may have been some sexual tension between Rampling & the actress who played the daughter.  And of course the filmmakers even go so far as to equate themselves with ""straight porn"" by making the male at the center of the film an unattractive mess.  I may have to give this film another chance but it won't be any time soon.  And I frankly don't know why Ms. Rampling receives so much critical acclaim.  I've always found her acting wanting.  But that's just my opinion.",Swimming Pool

839523,"Much too often i dont understand people and even more so the so called ""professional critics"". I went to see ""Van Helsing"" having read barrages of reviews describing it as anywhere between the disaster of all disasters or the joke to end all jokes. Knowing better than to trust critics i decided to risk 2 hours of my saturday night and i didn't regret it.Van Helsing is two hours of absolutely spectacular tongue in cheek entertainment. That's what it is, and anybody who's judging it on any other level than that is totally missing the point and will inevitably deprive himself of having fun with this cool flick.In a nutshell, Van Helsing is the guy to call when you've got trouble with some legendary monster. He arrives complete with his special tools and weapons and takes care of the gory business till the next job. From the opening sequence of the film when Helsing takes on a version of dr. Jekyll that looks more like an offshoot of the Hulk, you know you're in for some serious parody fun with loads of aces in the formula:the effects are truly stunning, but what makes the package even more attractive is the settings, the locations. Van Helsing's adventures take place in 17-18th century Europe, and the monsters are roaming all familiar cultural capitals like Paris or Vienna. The touch of the Eiffel tower being still under construction made me smile.But then the real plot kicks in and the opening sequence (which was by all means a treat) seems like peanuts.The exterminator is sent off to legendary Transylvania, where an all-star monster team is terrorising the locals, headed by Dracula and his flying-vampire brides (they totally steal the show of the first hour of the film) along with his army of genetic horrors, a stolen Frankestein with a partially blinking skull, Quasimodo who takes his orders directly from the King Vampire Himself, and of course, werewolves the kind of which i doubt you've seen in such form.Sounds like all this could be a mess to even attempt to tie into a ""story""? Well, as far as I'm concerned, the scriptwriters did a great job of tieing all this together without insulting the audience, except for that part of the audience who insist stubbornly of treating this seriously. Those you can't satisfy anyway.Once these formalities are taken care of, and once you've understood on what level the premise of this film will work, the rest is a grand success really. The settings are even more impressive now, as the sky-piercing tower of Dracula appears together with the ultra-gothic village at the feet of his mountain which serves as a food source for him and his brides.The effects jump to jaw-dropping levels by now, and this becomes a super-fun ride. Surprisingly, the nice touches here and there never cease appearing, as  the Dracula character is totally slick and very good with punchlines, while his brides have all the appropriate lines to qualify as high-flying, blood-sucking vixens of the highest order.I thought that by that time the wheels of the film should be about to fall off. It never happened though. ""Van Helsing"" keeps a frenetic pace through-out right to the very end, its parody feel is always there in perfect balance, and the overall result is actually very successful when you consider how badly this could've failed.To be sure, this film belongs in that category where you need to partly shut your brain off in order to enjoy it, but I'll tell you what: I've seen too many films lately where you're supposed to watch with your brain full-on and where the result was an utter joke. At least Van Helsing is totally honest with the viewer which is exactly why you can't possibly feel cheated afterwards, unless of course you want to. That's what some people would call bias (me included).The paradox of it all? That would be the fact that to make a film like Van Helsing work you need an intelligent film crew, especially that part of the crew involving the directing and the script-writting.One of the most fun films of 2004....",N/A
786758,"Early on in ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" Diane Lane's character Frances, a writer dumped by her husband and now on a gay tour of Tuscany, helps out a fellow American by writing a postcard to send to his mother.  He takes one look at her flowery, overwrought prose and throws it down in disgust, saying, ""Mom will never believe I wrote that!"" Like the words on that postcard, there are many cringe-worthy moments in this film.We get a homogenized, romanticized view of Tuscany, the way most middle-aged American women who feel unloved by their cloddy spouses might imagine it.  Stereotypes abound--there's the red-hot younger Italian lover (named Marcello, of course) whose broken English is supposed to be charming; the free-spirited, batty English woman (the fabulous Lindsay Duncan trapped inside a cliche) who takes joy in shocking the locals; the star-crossed young lovers; the elderly man still pining for his dead love; and the sassy yet approachable gay friend.Diane Lane is stunning as usual, but she mugs for the camera and hams it up a la Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan in too many instances, as if the audience might be too stupid to pick up on nuanced emotion.  She's played unhappy characters of this age before, and much more subtly and convincingly, in ""Unfaithful"" and ""A Walk on the Moon.""The views of Tuscany are gorgeous and motivation enough to make you want to drop everything and run off to Italy, even if the film itself is a forgettable, sometimes fun romp.",N/A

897904,"Lois & Clark is perhaps one of the best television shows that I have ever seen. I have been a Superman fan for a long time now, and this show brought the classic Superman saga back to life. Everything about this show was done the right way. First of all, the show itself featured a wonderful mix of action, comedy, and romance. This managed to satisfy all different types of people. Some fans would watch the show due to Superman and his powers, while others would watch the show to watch the romance between Clark and Lois play out.Lois & Clark features perhaps the best casting picks I have ever seen. Every actor chosen for the show was perfect for the part that they played. Dean Cain was able to turn both characters off and on very easily. He nailed the geeky and adorable charm of Clark Kent, and the strong hero persona of Superman. Teri Hatcher personified Lois Lane. She not only posessed the beauty of the character, but she also brought the attitude, spunk, and her talent for comedy as well. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher probably had the best on screen chemistry that I have ever seen, and they really made the relationship between Clark and Lois believeable. Lane Smith was great as Perry White. He brought the tough as nails personality to the character, as well as the funny and light hearted side that would make us all laugh. Lane's obsession with Elvis Presley brought a lot of entertaining moments to the show. K Callan and Eddie Jones were outstanding as The Kents. They also had outstanding chemistry between them, and did a very good job supplying the support and love that Clark needed. My only gripe casting wise was Jimmy Olsen. The first season Jimmy was played by Michael Landes, who I felt nailed the role. However, from seasons 2-4 the show's producers wanted an actor that appealed to more of a younger audience and they went with Justin Whalin. While Justin did a good job, I always felt that Michael did a much better job, and should have remained in the cast.Overall, Lois & Clark is one of the best shows ever made in my opinion. All of the actors involved were unbelieveable, the effects used for Superman's powers were very well done, and the show featured a wonderul mix of action, comedy, and romance that made the show extremely well rounded and enjoyable overall. Ever since Smallville was put on the air, Lois and Clark and Smallville have battled to claim the title of best Superman show. While I highly enjoy Smallville, it will never come close to Lois and Clark in my opinion. If there was ever a show that deserved to be released on DVD, it is Lois and Clark. Frankly I am suprised that season 1 has not already been put out. The show continues to gain fans through reruns in syndication, and even Dean Cain himself has put in a request for the show's release on DVD.",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1
558399,"As a serious women in prison film collector, I can state that no other film than 'reform school girls' better epitomizes what the genre is about more completely.It has all the humorous elements one would expect in a such a film; the wicked wardeness, the bad butch girls, the helpless girl, the kitten stomp,  shower scenes, fights,  brandings, DDT delousing and did I mention shower scenes?  Where do girls in a juvenile facility get all that fancy langerie anyway?Wendy O'Willimas puts in a convincing and moving performance as a wicked correctional official and seems to delight in her evil role.  Sybil Danning makes an extended cameo that was mandatory for a film of this type in the 1980's.Although it lacks the gladitorial competitions of 'Lust for Freedom' or the exploitative child birth scene of 'Bad Girls Dormitory', it is cheerful and builds up gradually to a frenzy of revolutionary fervor.  This film will definitely not disappoint.This is also a good film for those new to the genre and those who enjoy the excesses of the 80's.",N/A
837848,"John Cassavetes was an artist who believed that filmmaking's salvation lay in ""individual expression"" and applied this belief to his own movies. He is often credited as the father of American independent cinema and to be sure without him there would be no Martin Scorsese, Jim Jarmusch or John Sayles. For years, fans of Cassavetes' movies have had to suffer with grainy copies and substandard transfers on DVD (or, quite often no availability at all). The folks at Criterion have answered their prayers with a fantastic box set with five of the man's movies and Charles Kiselyak's epic documentary.The Shadows disc features an interview with one of the film's stars, Lelia Goldini, who talks about how she met Cassavetes and her impressions of the man. She also covers the improv exercises that he would stage and how they developed into the movie. There is also an interview with Seymour Cassel who reminisces about how he met Cassavetes and how he got a job on the crew making Shadows. A real find is never-before-seen silent footage of rehearsals for the film in Cassavetes' acting workshop. Also included is featurette examining the painstaking restoration process that transformed the original print into this new glorious version. Finally, there is an excellent behind-the-scenes still gallery and a trailer.Faces features an alternate opening sequence that was originally screened in Toronto and rearranges the chronology of scenes. ""Cineastes de Notre Temps"" is a French TV program that interviewed Cassavetes in '65 while he was making Faces and then again in '68 after it had been screened. The first interview finds him in a playful mood as he jokes about making a musical of Crime and Punishment. In the second interview he claims that he's the worst director but tries to create an environment that allows the actors to express themselves honestly. ""Making Faces"" is a 42-minute featurette with new interviews with Gena Rowlands, Lynn Carlin, Seymour Cassel and editor/producer Al Ruban. Rowlands talks about how they financed the movie themselves so they'd have complete control while Cassel talks about how Cassavetes was his best friend and mentor. Finally, Ruban discusses the equipment he used to shoot the film in the ""Lighting and Shooting the Film"" featurette. He goes through specific scenes via text and clips from the movie providing excellent insight into how certain techniques were achieved.A Woman Under the Influence features an audio commentary by cameraman Mike Ferris and sound recordist/composer Bo Harwood. This movie marked the first time they worked together and they would go on to collaborate with Cassavetes on The Killing of a Chinese Bookie and Opening Night. Next up, is an excellent conversation between Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk. They talk about Cassavetes' approach to filmmaking and fondly recount anecdotes about making the movie. There is also an audio interview done with Cassavetes in `75 that covers a wide variety of topics: improvisation, casting, directing and so forth. Rounding out the disc is a trailer and a rare collection of behind-the-scenes photos taken on the set of the movie.Included on The Killing of a Chinese Bookie disc is the original 135 minute version released in `76 and the truncated 108 minute version that came out in '78. The first version was rush job and became a commercial and critical failure. It was pulled from theatres after a week and two years later Cassavetes cut almost 30 minutes out and re-released it. There is a fascinating interview with Ben Gazzara and Al Ruban. The actor recounts how the first audience to see the movie hated it and this broke his heart. Ruban also talks about the negative reaction and Cassavetes' desire to re-cut his movie as a result. There is another audio interview with Cassavetes where he talks at length about working in genres and how he got the idea for the movie. Finally, there is a collection of rare, behind-the-scenes photographs.Opening Night features a conversation between Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. They speak warmly and fondly about their experiences working on the movie, recounting several stories. There is also an interview with Al Ruban who talks about Cassavetes complete immersion in every aspect of his movies: sets, costumes and so on. There is another audio interview with Cassavetes where he talks about the play that occurs within the film and comparing movies to plays. Finally, there is a trailer.Cassavetes fiercely believed that ""to compromise an idea is to soften it, to make an excuse for it, to betray it."" The five films that are included in this box set certainly adhere to these words and represent the man's pure and unfiltered artistic expression. This is an impressive box set that also includes a 68-page booklet with essays by Cassavetes and critics and interviews with the man that does a great job putting his movies and personal philosophy into the proper context.",N/A
327304,"Poor Count Dracula.  In over 70 years of moviemaking, the bloody vampire has been played by everyone from Bela Lugosi to Leslie Nielsen; Gerard Butler to Frank Langella; Christopher Lee to David Peel; and so on and so on.  Now, Christopher Atkins from THE BLUE LAGOON plays the vampire's son, a blond charmer who doesn't really want to be a vampire, and who is mooning over his lost love from 500 years ago.  She is now embodied in an art restorer's persona, played lazily and lifeless by Stacey Travis.  Doug Wert plays the bad vampire as if he was in a Saturday Night Live skit, which would have worked had the movie had its tongue in its cheek. Alas, though, it tries to be a Gothic romance horror film, and doesn't capture the essence of any of them.Burdened with repetitive flashback scenes that tell us how Atkins and Wert became vampires, the movie lopes along at a snail's pace, and the climax is amazingly funny.  With special effects straight from the dark age, we are treated to Atkins who is now dressed in white and who can shoot sparks from his hands, and summon demonic bats.DRACULA RISING joins the countless vampire movies that just don't have any bite!",N/A

There was also the ""battle"" for Viggo's attention between the evil American woman and the Sheik's daughter.  I really enjoyed the concept of honor that weighted heavily in this film's concept.

259499,"Before I review Black Rain, let me tell you that I agree with some of the previous reviewers that the picture quality of this DVD (its better on VHS) is totally unacceptable.  When I first watched it, I had to check my cable connections to make sure they weren't at fault.  What a let-down.  Mr. Scott should be raising hell over this.With that said, this is one of my favorite action movies.  It portrays Detective Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) as an outgoing, old-school cop who takes moral short-cuts to get the job done.  His partner, a relatively new Detective (Andy Garcia) is along for the ride.  They have a run-in with a Japanese mobster (Yakuza) named Sato.  After arresting Sato for commiting two murders in a New York restaurant, the Detectives are ordered to escort him back to Japan to face charges there.  They manage to let Sato escape as he arrives in Japan.  A Japanese Detective (Ken Takarara) is assigned to help out the New York Detectives.Douglas, Garcia and Takarara are excellenty cast in their respective roles.  The screenplay is well written.  I must say that the cinematography is really good.  Japan, the once-conquered nation, is now an industrial powerhouse.  But, like the U.S., it suffers from the ills of corruption and violence.  Ridley Scott does a great job of showing the tension between the two cultures.  The Japanese, &quot;bound by duty and honor&quot;, and the Americans, loud and outspoken, are viewed as somewhat obnoxious by their counterparts. The musical score is incredible.  Hans Zimmer really brings this movie to life with an array of Japanese and American-themed music that injects just the right amount of tension for the corresponding scene.  Brilliantly done.This movie is 5-Star material, but the DVD version is a huge disapointment.  I would wait to see if a special edition DVD comes out (I can only hope) with the video quality this movie deserves.",Black Rain VHS

805961,"I'm not joking.I'll be frank: I was hyped up for this film.  Even ignoring the incredible play that is actually life changing, it has a stellar cast and incredible behind the scenes crew.  I wanted it to be good; I needed it to be good.  To say that it superceded my expectations is an understatement.This play/movie challenges and provokes; entertains and amuses; floods you with grief and compassion.  Those final words (which I won't spoil if you haven't seen it) make my heart sing.  It features career defining work from Streep, Parker, Wilson and Pacino (Streep in particular is stellar in three different roles), and what had better be career exploding roles for Patrick Wilson, Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, and Jeffrey Wright.  These gentlemen are doing work that they'll have a hard time topping.  Wright manages to take Kushner's poetry and transform it into something Whitmanesque, Shakespearean in it's grandeur and heartbreaking imagery.  He does more with a glance than most actors can do with an entire script.  Patrick Wilson makes Joe's pain so real that it's heartwrenching for the audience.  When he utters ""I'm going to hell for doing this"", you can't help but cry out in sympathy.  Kirk is phenomenal as our leading character - he mixes pathos with deep (and broad) humour, and not only provides the biggest laughs (well, Wright too), but it's only because the comedy is rooted in pain.  Shenkman has the most difficult role - he's the author's stand in.  He's also kinda unsympathetic, and his hyperintelligence isn't portrayed as well as it should be (director/writer, not actor), but Shenkman manages to pull of these disparate pieces into a cohesive whole.I'm giving it five stars not because it's perfect (indeed, there are a few little flaws), but because anything this good doesn't need to be perfect.  Anything with this much stuff, in terms of ideas, drama, humour, depth and profundity is reall quite something.  The opening credits are gorgeous (seriously breathtaking.  That's how good this movie is).Watch it, treasure it, remember it, and whenever someone bashes Hollywood for producing crap, remind them that it can also produce beautiful things.

630182,"Out of curiosity I watched Fahrenheit 9/11 recently for the first time, after the election. I am informed enough to realize that much of the information presented in the film was cherry-picked, which resulted in a heavily slanted take on events. It's not that it's necessarily wrong, but there's always two sides to a story and this film only shows you one. It is entertaining at times and if you're a Michael Moore fan you'll enjoy it. To call this film a documentary is a stretch though. I have to agree with those that are calling it propaganda. As a moderate Democrat (I don't HATE Bush - I just don't care for his policies very much, and I'm hoping for the best in Iraq.) I found it somewhat repulsive to be associated with this film and embarrassed that Moore was displayed so prominently during the convention. Looking back on the election I think that this film worked against us, firing up the Democratic base, who were already going to vote against Bush, and repelling everyone else. In the end, I think that history will not look very kindly on Mr. Moore. A deceitful ideologue at best. A traitor at worst. 1 stars for skillful manipulation. 1 star for content.",Fahrenheit 9/11
395070,"Of the films that Don Knotts made with Universal Studios after he left the highly successful Andy Griffith Show, The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966) has always been my one of my favorites.  This was the first of five films Knotts made with Universal from the mid 60's until the early 70's.Helmed by veteran television director Alan Rafkin, The Ghost and Mr. Chicken stars Don Knotts as Luther Heggs, a typesetter at a small town newspaper with dreams of someday becoming a reporter.  While driving home one dark and stormy night, Luther, passing the old Simmons place, a local haunted house where a particularly brutal murder-suicide occurred some twenty years past, happens upon a murder victim, to which he gets all flustered in typical Knotts fashion as he sees his big chance to get a scoop and hopefully achieve his dreams of becoming a real newspaper man.  After taking a number of photos, he rushes off to the police station to report the crime, only to learn that the man wasn't murdered, and Luther finds himself in the uncomfortable position of having to deal with being a laughingstock, particularly by a his coworker Ollie, who is a reporter and works at the same paper as Luther.  Ollie is also involved with Alma, a local woman who Luther has pines for, but finds himself unable to tell her.Anyway, as the eve of the 20th anniversary of the murder-suicide at the Simmons house  approaches, Luther's newspaper, owned and operated by George Beckett (Dick Sargent), decides to try and capitalize on the event by having someone spend the night in the old Simmons place, and document any strange or unusual happenings.  We also learn that old man Simmons, who supposedly killed his wife and took his own life many years back, has a nephew, Nick Simmons, who is in town and trying to clear the bank lien on the house so he can demolish it, for whatever reasons.  Well, Luther does spend the night, or, at least part of the night, that is until strange things do start happening, odd noises, secret passages, maniacal laughter, mysterious organ music, portraits running with blood, etc., and Luther is driven from the house.  His spectacular story is printed, and interest is renewed in the Simmons house, causing Nick Simmons problems in gaining clear access to do with the house as he pleases, and results in him bringing a libel lawsuit against Luther and the newspaper.  During the trial, it's decided that the only way to clear things up is to actually go to the Simmons house and try to re-enact the events as Luther related them, and determine once and for all the truth.  At the house, the procession finds the spirits that haunted Luther previously unresponsive, and things certainly look bad for Luther.  Is the house truly haunted?  What was the nature of the crime committed so many years ago?Knotts is great, performing his 'nervous man' routine, and a number of Andy Griffith Show regulars make brief appearances in the film including Hal Smith as Calver Weems (he was Otis, the town drunk on The Andy Griffith Show), and Hope Summers as Suzanne Blush (she played Clara Edwards on The Andy Griffith Show).  One of my favorite scenes is when the town is having a celebratory picnic for Luther after his article detailing his night spent within the Simmons house (exaggerated quite a bit by his editor to make Luther seem braver than he actually was) and Luther has to get up in front of everyone and deliver a speech.  Suffering from a severe case of stage fright, and losing his notes to a convenient gust of wind, Luther tries to wing it, with hilarious results.  Here's a snippet 'I have been called brave. What is brave? Let me clarify this. Of course we all know this is short for brave-r-y. That goes without even being said. But is also a symbol of another thing....'  There is also a couple of running gags throughout the film, one being someone off-screen yelling out  'Atta boy, Luther!' at certain points in the film.  What makes Knott's performances so great in this film and other roles of a similar nature?  I guess it's his willingness for self-deprecation, presenting himself as a buffoon, allowing the audience to derive much laughter at his meek, nebbish characters.  All of his Universal pictures follow a similar format, showing a bumbling but likeable character with lofty aspirations, thrust into a situation allowing for a great downfall, and then redemption in the end, as the underdog ends up in a much better position than when the film started.Universal presents here a really good-looking wide screen print.  Special features include a theatrical trailer, and recommendations that list Knott's four other Universal films, including The Reluctant Astronaut (1967), The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968), The Love God? (1969), and How to Frame a Figg (1971).  Atta boy, Luther?  I say Atta boy, Don, for giving us much to laugh about, and entertaining so thoroughly.Cookieman108",N/A

743702,"While watching &quot;25th Hour&quot; I was treated to one of the most incredable and emotional monolouges that I have yet to see. It is done by Edward Nortons character of Monty, and in it he says something bad about probally every religion, race,and type of person that there is to make fun of. It was so powerfully moving, and it uses the f word a strong number of times. But the cursing doesn't matter because during the segment you can feel for the character of Monty, because I'm sure that everybody has had a comment to at least one of the people that Monty says something about.The movie stars Edward Norton, Barry Pepper, Brian Cox, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Edward Norton plays Monty Brogon, who is a drug dealer that decided that he was going to be legit, but he was too late, as the cops discovered drugs in the padding of his couch. He decides to spend his last night of freedom with his two best friends Jacob and Frank, as well as his girlfriend Naturelle Riviera. Monty is not the only one going through problems. Jacob is a teacher who have a crush on one of his students Mary D' Annunzio, who enjoys flirting with him. Frank is an investing banker, who can't believe that Monty and Naturelle allowed the police to find the drugs. Monty starts off his evening by having dinner with his father, played by Brian Cox. He then goes to a nightclub with his friends, and he also meets his drug lord boss Uncle Nikolai. As the night grows old, Monty begins to wonder who is the one who turned him in to the cops, and he begins to get to the fact that he cannot rust anybody, not his friends, not his girlfriend, nobody that he knows, because any of them could be a traitor.At the end of &quot;25th Hour&quot; you do find out who is the person that turned Monty in, and I was surprised. I am trying not to reveal anything that could ruin the movie, but the person who turned him in is the last person that I suspected. But as the night wore on and it was almost time for his to go to jail, I was interested. This movie was a seris of conversations between people. There was ten minute long conversations, five minute long conversations. But its through these conversations that you could determine who may have or may have not turned Monty in. I saw &quot;25th Hour&quot; about a year ago, and I loved it so much, that I remembered it to include it on my Top 10 List of 2003. See &quot;25th Hour&quot; and just listen to what the character's say. It's a brilliant film that I recommend.Also see this movie for the preformances. I love Edward Norton as an actor, and thought his preformance in &quot;Death to Smoochy,&quot; showed that he could do comedy as well as hard drama like this. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great in this as he is in everything. &quot;Punch Drunk Love,&quot; &quot;Along Came Polly,&quot; &quot;Almost Famous,&quot; and many other titles stand under his name. He is a brilliant actor that should get more respect, especially in this movie. Edward Norton should have won Best Actor during the Oscars last year for this. The is a classic film.

185281,"They are amateurs and pros, London dwellers moving equally comfortably in international society as in that of their occasional forays into the English countryside, and lifelong inhabitants of those rural settings.  They investigate crimes in the Thames valley and cities as large as Oxford, midsize towns like a certain Kingsmarkham, and villages with such all-English names as St. Mary Mead or King's Abbot.  And they have been portrayed by some of Britain's finest contemporary actors, from Jeremy Brett and David Burke/Edward Hardwicke (Sherlock Holmes & Doctor Watson) to Roy Marsden (Commander Adam Dalgliesh), John Thaw and Kevin Whately (D.C.I. Morse & D.S. Lewis), David Jason (D.I. ""Jack"" Frost), George Baker and Christopher Ravenscroft (D.C.I. Reginald Wexford & D.I. Mike Burden), Peter Davison and Brian Glover (Albert Campion & Magersfontein Lugg), Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter (Lord Peter Wimsey & Harriet Vane), David Suchet/Albert Finney (Hercule Poirot) and last but not least Joan Hickson as Miss Jane Marple, the grandmother of all English village detectives.To that illustrious group, British author Caroline Graham in 1987 added another sleuthing couple, the middle-aged D.C.I. Tom Barnaby and his young colleague D.S. Gavin Troy, coppers in a cluster of villages which, collectively, make up an area known as Midsomer County, and which could easily rival Agatha Christie's very own St. Mary Mead in per-capita occurrences of treachery, crime and bloodletting.  The series' first entry, ""The Killings at Badgers Drift,"" was so successful that it won a Macavity Award for best first mystery and, for its author, an instant loyal following.  Before long, the books spawned a television series, which at almost 30 episodes has long since outrun the number of its print originals.  Starring as Barnaby and Troy are Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus John Nettles, best known to TV audiences as Jerseyan Detective Sergeant Jim Bergerac in the 1980s' series of the same name (based on the books by Andrew Saville), and Daniel Casey, whose most notable other roles to date have been appearances in the BBC's ""Our Friends in the North"" and the 1998 Catherine Cookson adaptation ""The Wingless Bird.""  Nettles and Casey are an engaging team, not quite faithful to their characters' literary versions - which however works well to their advantage; particularly in the case of Daniel Casey's Troy, who is less brash and more goodnaturedly witty than in the books, and who presents a good foil for Nettles's emphatic Barnaby; in turn overall more reminiscent of George Baker's Wexford than of Nettles's own Bergerac, whose domestic bliss is spoiled, again and again, by the callings of his job; to his regret as much as to his family's; yet, he is to much of a professional not to heed those callings every single time.With release of the series' episodes already underway in Britain, Acorn Media has now proceeded to the ""region 1"" transcription of its installments, individually and in collections of four episodes each.  And while it is unfortunate that the TV version of ""The Killings at Badgers Drift"" - which not only introduced the characters of Barnaby and Troy but is also expressly referenced in this first collection's installment ""Death's Shadow"" - is neither part of this first nor even of the second boxed set released in the U.S., overall this is a most welcome and long overdue opportunity for fans of the series to reacquaint themselves with this winning pair of detectives and the not-so peaceful, albeit wonderfully filmed setting of rural Midsomer County.This collection features the following episodes:""Beyond the Grave:""  Assisted by Barnaby's son, who is to ""shadow"" Troy in preparation of a school theatre appearance as a policeman, the two detectives have to get to the bottom of a series of seemingly paranormal events at Aspern Tallow Museum, all the while investigating the murders of a descendant of a long-deceased village hero and another local man who, like so many of the village residents, turns out not to always have been the honorable citizen his neighbors had known him to be.""Blood Will Out:""  Martyr Warren magistrate Hector Bridges is a Falklands hero, but also a man with an irascible temper, which endears him to few of his neighbors - and even less so to the traveler clans who assemble in the village one summer week, and whose leader has a bone of his own to pick with the magistrate.  But are the wayfarers - the quintessential ""usual suspects"" for everything from theft to horsetrading - also guilty of his murder?  (And will Barnaby survive the diet imposed on him by his wife and daughter without succumbing to the temptations of candy bars and chocolate cakes?)""Death's Shadow:""  Dark childhood memories haunt successful director Simon Fletcher as he returns to Badgers Drift to teach a summer acting workshop, one of whose attendees is Barnaby's daughter Callie.  As he arrives, a series of arcane and seemingly unconnected murders begins in the village.  Caught between the investigation and the preparations of the ceremonial confirmation of his marriage vows at Badgers Drift church, Barnaby eventually realizes that he has to dig deep into the hamlet's past to find the deeply disturbed mind responsible for the horrors visited upon its population.""Strangler's Wood:""  The forest's true name is Raven's Wood, but ever since three young women were found there strangled with a necktie years ago, it is more commonly known as ""Strangler's Wood."" Not surprising, then, that the discovery of yet another murdered woman ten years after the original crimes (this time a beautiful Brazilian model) brings forth premonitions of the worst kind; especially since the culprit responsible for the first three crimes was never caught.  But did he really return to his evil ways, as suddenly as he had stopped murdering so long ago?  As Barnaby and daughter Callie make an attempt at father-daughter bonding and Troy seizes an opportunity to demonstrate his linguistic prowess, they investigate the dead beauty's movements in Midsomer County - and unmask, yet again, more than one of its residents who is not quite as honorable as he seems.Also recommended:The Killings at Badger's Drift (Inspector Barnaby Mysteries)Midsomer Murders - The Early Cases CollectionInspector Morse - Complete CollectionRuth Rendell Mysteries - Simisola / Road RageP.D.

786714,"I tried to like this because this is normally the type of movie that I would choose to view and I am a Diane Lane fan, but this movie did not impress me.  Diane Lane plays a fairly submissive role.  She doesn't sparkle or shine, and neither does the cinematographer's rendition of the Tuscan countryside. There are some pretty scenes, but they don't carry over to set the mood for the film as they should. Certainly not enough to redeem this movie above standard fare. There are several likeable characters in the movie. I especially enjoyed the older,handsome,but unfortunately married real estate agent.  I felt for Ms. Lane's character - too bad he was taken!  I haven't read the book, but I read a review that said that actually the main character and her husband renovated the house in Tuscany (not the new divorcee on her own looking for love and fulfillment), so maybe that's why this movie falls short -too much artistic license.  In any case, you might enjoy this light movie, or you might be disappointed, but if you like Diane Lane's natural beauty and intensity, you should see &quot;A Walk On the Moon&quot; (one of my favorite movies)and &quot;Unfaithful&quot;.

667962,"Wow. That's all I can say after watching this, one of the silliest (and conceptually grossest) of all of Mikels' films. I am a true fan of bad movies, but I have mixed feelings on this one. On the one hand the director's commentary is very interesting, even though it's disturbing what he finds funny (no surprise there, I suppose...), and it is a fun movie to mock in a kind of 'Plan 9' way (The 'sets' of the hospital are amazingly realistic! Not!), certainly the plot is silly and fun to riff on. In essence we have a corrupt, near-bankrupt cat food magnate running the Lotus Cat Food Company who decides to cut costs by grinding up corpses, cadavers, and later his own victims. (That's a plus: it certainly beats 'downsizing'; laying off all your employees in the States and exporting their jobs overseas, as is all the managerial rage today.) The only problem is that once the cats taste human flesh, they return to their wild roots and attack their owners, killing them in the most hilarious 'attack' sequences you have ever seen. It is wonderful watching the people holding onto the killer cats for dear life, trying to keep them from running away while making it look like a life or death struggle. Eventually a doctor and nurse couple finds out what's going on and confronts the evil cat food magnate in the climactic scene.So much for the good part. The bad part is that while very unrealistic, the movie was still gross, in a disgusting, dirty way. The repeated scene of the meat coming out of the meat grinder was not really especially gory, but it was used about a thousand times and got pretty tiresome. I like these nutty, cult movies, but I think Mikels has done better, and way more amusing, movies, such as &quot;Girl in the Gold Boots&quot;. If you have seen that movie as well, you will note that several key people are in both movies, and in fact they were filmed in the same year.Overall, I decided on three stars for boring gore and general amateurishness, although I debated about giving it four stars which is probably what it would deserve for most grade Z movie fans. The deciding factor, interestingly, was an extra on the DVD. The DVD has several extras including the director's commentary track, a filmography, behind the scenes pictures (don't expect too much), and a video 'tribute' to the movie by Bentmen called 'Immaculate Contraption'. I found 'Immaculate Contraption' to be the five most painful minutes of cinema viewing in my life. It was badly produced (and not in a campy, fun way), the music was wretched, and it was generally putrid. That became the tiebreaker and earned the film three stars instead of the four I originally intended. Save yourself the pain. 'Immaculate Contraption' is neither immaculate or a contraption, but it positively is rubbish.",The Corpse Grinders
829439,"Film: *****  Extras: *****  DVD Transfer Quality: BOMBAnother huge disappointment from Fox Home Video.  ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" was 20th Century-Fox's most prestigious production of 1938, featuring three of the studio's biggest box office draws (Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche); a marvelous supporting cast led by Ethel Merman, Jean Hersholt, and John Carradine; outstanding direction by veteran Henry King; and a slight but entertaining script that showcased more than two dozen of prolific songwriter Irving Berlin's most beloved melodies.  The prototype for the big budget musicals that Fox would perfect in the 1940's, the film was a huge hit with the public and critics alike, garnering six Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and winning the statuette for Best Music Scoring.One might think that Fox would take special care in mastering such a revered film for its DVD release - especially when releasing it under the Fox ""Studio Classics"" banner - but one would be wrong.  Although the film's soundtrack has been painstakingly preserved, the visuals are inexcusably shoddy. Specifically, there is a visual noise line that appears in the midst of Chapter 8 (during the song ""Now It Can Be Told"") and continues to disrupt the picture for the remaining hour or so of the film.  This distortion never appeared on the various prints shown on pay cable stations during the past 20 years, and should not appear in a home video release that purports to be ""restored"".This major and obnoxious glitch is especially upsetting because the rest of the DVD is so appealing.  The extras include 3 rarely seen musical sequences that were deleted from the final cut of the film; the Original Theatrical Trailer; Fox Movietone News footage of the film's British premiere (fascinating to see the English hoopla surrounding this quintessentially American feature); and best of all, the full-length A&E; Biography segment, ""Alice Faye: The Girl Next Door"".  If only the film itself were as lovingly presented as the wonderful bonus materials, this would be a must-have DVD.  A pity.",N/A
604140,"""In America"" is Jim Sheridan's semi-autobiographical film of an Irish family who emigrate to America, partly to forget the pain of the loss of their young son.  This is an unforgettable film that touches the heart and demostrates the power of love to heal.  Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine are wonderful as the mon and dad who bravely struggle to raise their two adorable young daughters in their run-down tenement apartment in New York. There they meet a lonely, brooding and bitter artist from Africa, Mateo, who is dying of AIDS.  Almost magically, Mateo changes theirs and his own life in unexpected ways.  Although I feel that Sheridan sometimes tries a little too hard to tug at the heart strings, ""In America"" is a loving and touching film that truly moved me.",In America

I have longed for the original three movies to come out on DVD. So they finally did. I brought my copy of it from a retail (not amazon.com) store on its first day relase. I last watched ANH, ESB and ROTJ on cable TV back in May 2001. I did notice the additional scenes and re-edits since I last watched them, but they did not reduce the joy of watching them one bit at all! I know some do not like the additional scenes and re-edits, and I can understand that, but remember almost all of the movie run time (about 387 minutes) is still from the originals. So you are still getting (IMHO) the feel and spirit of the movies as they were originally made. And thank George Lucas for at least offering us this box set.

753819,"I have the Scooby Doo Golden Collection and I think it's great to have loads of Scooby Doo episodes together in one collection. These new episodes are great but giving us 4 at a time is not a good idea and I really think Warner would have been better off investing their time (as we would invest our money) in a First Season Box Set.What we are given for now are four episodes running 22 minutes each. A couple of them have below average stories but the other two are up to scratch. The animation and color pallet are very bright and modern as is the soundtrack which incorporates more original music than the old school shows (which tended to re-use temp scores and source music over and over) but manages to work in familiar themes.For Scooby Doo purists there is no sacrilege here. Shaggy and Scooby/Fred are performed by Casey Kasem and Frank Welker so there's not too much of a divide between this and old school to distance older fans from the new show.For what it is, the DVD presents the show absolutely flawlessly in 1.33:1 full frame with pretty active Dolby 2.0 surround and some minimal fluff extras.

62900,"There are several reasons I like this movie.  1) Trevanian wrote the book (trashy, pulp spy fiction...great for a mindless romp into the 60's), Clint Eastwood is in it (not the greatest actor, but he's got a good track record, and he enjoys the craft) 3) The Eiger has always intrigued me 4) I used to climb (age has curtailed my abilities) and 5) My 3rd cousin (Heidi Bruhl) is in it, albeit she plays a trampy wife, but she's my 3rd cousin nonetheless.

The challenges were overcome, which and certainly took a bit of skill and logistics to pull it off.

The first time I viewed I didn't even realize that such a diverse group of characters was, for the most part, played by three very funny, very talented, very well made-up comics, and I still don't know how one transforms into the puffy nutty third-rate businessman.

The film was very popular and was temporarily banned by Stalin after Germany signed a nonagression pact with the Soviet Union.The film is on disc 1 and has the following special features.Restoration demonstration, Production stills and storyboard drawings, a multimedia essay by Russel Merrit on Sergei Eisenstein's work with Sergei Prokofiev on the film's score, an feature length essay on the film by David Bordwell, who wrote a book on Eisenstein's films, and there is also stills and dialog from Eisentein's unfinished film, Bezhin Meadow with photos of the film's set.Ivan the Terrible parts 1 and 2 are the first two parts of an unfinished trilogy. Several scenes of part 3 were filmed but only one scene is known to survive today.The film follows the life of Tsar Ivan Vassilivich also known as Ivan the Terrible (Ivan Groznyy). He is credited with uniting the people of Russia into a single nation. The first film covers his coronation and a battle that was fought to reclaim lost territory. The film is also very famous and has music by Prokofiev.The first part on disc 2 has the folloving special features:The deleted prologue sequence covering part of Ivan's childhood where he witnesses the poisoning murder of his mother and also contains another deleted scene.

Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi lack the initial punch, but taken as a whole it is an immensely rewarding set.  The prequels are more spectacular in terms of scope but nothing compares to the impact these movies had on the general public when they came out in the late 70's and early 80's.  2001: A Space Odyssey lavishly portrayed space but took a decidely existential approach to the subject, whereas Star Wars treated space as a wild frontier.

127520,"Is ""Titanic"" a marvelously crafted film?  You bet your life preserver it is.  It is hard to argue that the film did not deserve the Oscars it won for Visual Effects, Film Editing and Cinematography.  However, does the fact that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences went insane in 1997 (awarding 11 Oscars out of 14 nominations) make it a great film, or is it simply a bunch of eye candy wrapped around an unbelieveably cheesy love story?Rich girl meets poor (but plucky) boy from the wrong side of the tracks and starts a romance doomed to failure.  My goodness, we surely have never seen this story before, now have we?  No amount of special effects, as magnificent as they may be, can conceal the cringe-worthy dialogue between Leo & Kate that the viewer is forced to endure.  The dialogue makes me think at times of those wretched, teen-angst-riddled WB dramas that currently infest the airwaves.  There are whole scenes that are almost unbearable to watch, the dialogue gets to be so poor.Even the spectacular nature of the movie has waned a little bit in the intervening years.  Like many summer blockbuster flicks tht are largely propelled by their special effects, ""Titanic"" is one of those movies best seen on the big screen.  Once it is transferred to the more confined medium of a television screen --- even a big one --- the impact of the images on the screen tends to be lessened, and one is forced (sadly) to rely on the skill of the actors to maintain the interest of the viewers.  I don't think anyone is going to remember ""Titanic"" for its riveting performances.  Kate Winslet does an adequete job, but I think the Academy was being pretty generous in giving her a nomination for Best Actress.  Nothing against the old crone who played the billion-years-old Rose, but what in her performance really merited a nomination anyway?  As to the performances of the rest of the cast --- well, I think it says volumes that the Academy, while it was handing out nominations left and right, elected not to honor most of the principals with acting nominations.This isn't a totally horrible film by any means --- at points it can be quite moving & touching.  There are times when the ship was near sinking, as one sees the various passengers coping with a death that is rapidly approaching, that one wishes the whole movie could be like this.  Unfortunately, James Cameron preferred to go the route of cheesy romance, and that results in an average movie at best.",Titanic VHS

When the writing is fresh, the cast scores 110 %, and the humor is @ the top of it's game you just can't go wrong. When I was growing up I lived a simular life sorta like Malcolm's only minus the 165 I.Q., I'm no where close to genius. What I did have was 3 siblings I had to share everything with, the oldest was my sister who was never home (much like Malcolm's oldest brother Francis) and my two brothers whom loved to aggravate one another, punch and brake each others toys on purpose. When I say sharing I mean we all shared the same bedroom at one time. It was no party, but I wouldn't go back in time and change anything. Well, maybe somethings. ..You might be asking yourself why is this guy telling his life story. Well I'm only trying to say that this show is the closest thing to my life in the sitcom world and after I watched a few episodes I was hooked.

31823,"There's no question as to whether this film is plausible or not. All of the technology needed to execute everything it depicts is in place and has been for some time. Physically, all of what it suggests could happen. It could be happening. The only real question is whether the ethics of the political and media machines are above doing it or not.This film takes that question and suggests what its answer might be. What comes out is a scathing commentary presented as the blackest of comedies. And it is very, very black. It succeeds though because it's strong on all fronts. The script, written by David Mamet and Hilary Henkin, is excellent. It's alive with wit. There are plenty of great opportunities for anyone with good timing, comic or dramatic, to make full use of them.Director Barry Levinson took full advantage of that. His sense of pacing is exceptional. The film never becomes bogged down. When the pace does slow for an instant now and then it serves as an opportunity for the viewer to absorb what they've seen. His sense of timing is excellent because the gags, though they're expected, always seem to come from nowhere. The editing, done by Stu Linder, is superb. If Levinson's timing was off anywhere Linder's editing corrected it.There really isn't a weak performance in this film but a few are so strong they have to be singled out. Woody Harrelson is in excellent form as the maniac-made-hero, ""Old Shoe"". Anne Heche gives a tour de force as the White House Press Agent who suddenly discovers the ""other side"" of her job. Robert De Niro is entirely convincing as the conniving manipulative spin master whose sole purpose is to see that only the ""right"" news items stay in the spotlight. The film belongs to Dustin Hoffman though. Next to his role in the Rain Man this is one of the best things I've seen him do. His ability to get right inside a character is still astonishing. His character, the vain and eccentric producer who pulls jewels from sewage, is the most likeable character in the film. That point serves to drive the grimmer side of the message this film is giving home.Wag the Dog is a film that addresses what has to be a touchy subject for a lot of people. It probably won't please a really large audience because of that. I don't know. I have no idea as to how well (or poorly) the film did at the box office. It's a film that should be seen though. The comment it makes isn't so much as to whether the political establishment is morally bankrupt or not but rather about how easily it would be for it to manipulate (or manufacture) facts if it is. It does it in a way that's consistently funny and it never loses sight of the point it's trying to make.There are some excellent notes provided in the ""special features"" section of the DVD. They provide a bit of history as to how Hollywood has been used as a ""spin machine"" to manipulate propoganda on behalf of what government wanted. Anyone taking the time to watch this film should read them. They provide plenty of incentive to view this film in a serious light.",N/A

178937,"Scott's ""Legend"" is a capable rendering of a romantic, mythic story. It has unicorns, fairies, a prince (not The Prince) of darkness, a man of the wild wood and of kind heart. They all come together in a well made story.The sets and effects stand up to the standards of 1985. The elves, fairies, and trolls are good, though they lack Henson's genius. Tom Cruise is young and handsome, with the emphasis on young. Tim Curry (aka Dr. Frank-N-Furter) is buried in his evil character - the character is good, but with that getup, it could have been almost anyone in there.The story comes together, the characters come together, the effects are effective. Somehow, though, the total seems less than the sum of its parts.I like it. I'll watch it again. It's good - it's just not brilliant.

13409,"The Horror Fan website &quot;Terror Trap&quot; refers to Candyman as probably the last great, traditional horror film.  It wasn't long after Candyman that Scream came out, revitalizing the genre, but also diluting it of the actual &quot;horror&quot;.Candyman plays upon the Bloody Mary urban legend.  If you look in a mirror and say &quot;Candyman&quot; several times, the real Candyman will appear behind you and gut you.  Of course idiots are bound to do it.  Then again the characters don't realize they are in a horror film.  Virginia Madsen plays a woman doing a thesis on urban legends and becomes fascinated in the Candyman legend.  Her research leads her to Cabrini-Green, one of the roughest neighborhoods in Chicago.  There, a Candyman murder was supposed to have occurred.  Unfortunately for her, her poking around draws the attention of the other-worldly Candyman and he teaches her a lesson about inspiring fear in others.A Clive Barker creation, Candyman is grim, very grim.  It leaves you at times wondering &quot;How will she ever get out of this?&quot;  Well, who says she will?  The Candyman (played by Tony Todd who portrayed Worf's brother on Star Trek:TNG) weilds a hook jammed into the stump of his bloody wrist and embodies all the nastiness hinted at by the better urban legends.  Someone you can't get away from and isn't restrained by the laws of the physical world.  Run away from him, keep running, and an hour later when you stop to catch your breath, there is Candyman just standing there.  Lock your door and turn around, and there he is.  Heck, even Jason Vorhees has to take the time to bash in the door.The Candyman DVD only offers trailers, but does have both full screen and widescreen on one disk, but that's about it.  It would have been nice to hear Todd and Madsen talk about the experience of making the film.  Hopefully we will see a special edition in the next year or so.

661623,"The Walt Disney Treasures line starts out strong in this title, Mickey Mouse in Living Color. What we get are the first 26 color Mickey cartoons, all uncut the way Walt wanted them to be seen. Disney, known for some editing for political corectness, has done it perfectly here, and collectors can now watch these shorts at their leisure. The shorts included range from 1935-1938, from The Band Concert to Brave Little Tailor. Those who grew up watching these will love the nostalgia, while those who simply remember the time Disney Channel had programming worthy of the Disney name will be delighted to see these rarely seen (until now) gems.The shorts have been listed numerous times so I don't need to do that. But in the Disney world today, true animation is being phased out for CGI, leaving classic animation as a lost art. Animation will never have the charm that the classics do though, which is why I am glad I got my hands on a copy of this dvd. Released in Wave 1 of the Treasures series, I think it sets the standard for what DVD can be and it truly gives justice to a seemingly lost art.The shorts have been remastered to look the best they possibly can. The colors are bright and vivid and truly give a great viewing experience. Sound-wise it is the best it will be. A lot of people express dislike of Leonard Maltin and his intros to the politically-incorrect shorts, but if it weren't for him we would not be seeing the original versions. Doing the intros was the only way Disney would give the public the uncut versions of the toons, so thumbs up for Maltin and his part in giving us the Walt Disney Treasures. Lastly, the extras included are pretty good including Mickey Mouse in Living Color featurette w/ Leonard Maltin, as well as pencil tests for a few select shorts. There are some easter eggs you will want to check out, and while I cannot remember right off where they are, you can go to dvdeastereggs.com for a listing of any easter eggs (hidden material).Overall I say any Disney fan must own this set. This may pose a problem to some because this is the rarest and most expensive of all of the Treasures. I recommend saving your money and buying this though because it is classic Disney at its best. All of the great aforementioned material comes in a special edition tin which is really great as well. If you are fortunate to find this set, you will be glad to have full access to some of the most creative and imaginative Disney animation there is. Be prepared to pay $90+ dollars for a mint in the tin copy though. This, along with the Goofy and Donald sets, is my favorite and in my opinion worth the price I paid. Get this while you can!",N/A
622288,"Before watching this movie, I had heard that there wasn't as much action as the first one. Which is fine with me because having watched some of Tarantino's previous films, I know that the outstanding dialog can be worth the admission price alone. The movie started out quite nicely. We finally got to see more of Bill. And the dialog was quite good. Good start. However, the movie seemed to go downhill for me after that. I found that the lack of action really was quite noticeable and the dialog didn't really fill the void. It's almost like these movies were made at different times and it makes me wonder what my impression would've been had I seen the entire thing all at once.

596517,"This was a very neat movie dealing with isolation, misery and the need for connection.  It's about 3 people who are in a bind, stuck in isolation, not really knowing how to deal with it or how to change it---plus they are surrounded by folks that either don't see them, or are well meaning, but cannot connect with them to help them.  The three people are Will (Grant), Marcus the boy, and his mother, Fiona (Collette).Will technically should be in Nirvana, he is wealthy, doesn't work, is attractive enough to nail a different gal every night, yet really isn't doing much with his life--no passions like travel, golf, friends, etc.  His idea of Christmas is watching videos and getting drunk at home, alone.  His domineering Stephord-Wife sister & dope husband constantly has humiliating ""interventions"" with him, even in public, trying to fix his ""loser-ness"".  They want him to live just like they do, with the house, baby and spoiled uncontrolleable-animal toddler that hits folks in the sack, goo on the upholstery--not appealing.For all that he feels ""OK"", he keeps searching for the next woman---as opposed to hiring an escort service which would be more logical for what he claims to ""want"" in a woman.  He's even started an elaborate scheme to meet single mothers, thinking  low-risk target.  (Still not an escort service, so I think he does hope ultimately for connection.)  He is very aware that his lifestyle is a turnoff to most women who have interests & passions.  He never keeps anybody around long enough to get close and risk more pain.  Basically, he's not really living what could be a really cool life.Fiona is a new-age hippy vegetarian music-therapist, and is raising her boy, Marcus, that way.  For all her career and success at living the completely hippy, vegetarian lifestyle, you would think she would be in bliss too, but she too is desperately sad and alone, without many friends.  She is very controlling over her boy, and he has no way to rebel against her controlling, politically-correct dominations.Marcus, who has only his mother's viewpoints, none of his own in the beginning, is a very nerdy, granola boy.  His mother screeches ""I love you's"" at his school playground, making him giant Bulleye.  He's completely dressed the opposite of all the other kids, plus he retreats from reality quite often, going into fantasyland and singing at the worst times.  He's watching his mother slide down the depression slope, and after her attempt at suicide, he decides to bring in extra help--unsuspecting Will.Will accidentally met Marcus while trying to score on one single mother.  Marcus sized him up and decided he was a good material for helping his mother.  Unfortunately, Will wasn't interested.  But, Marcus craves friendship, since he had none, and his mother is a basketcase.  So, the adventure begins with Marcus pursuing the unwilling Will.  You can see though, that Will is growing to really depend on the human contact.I do think they are about the same age, although not sure what age that is.  The boy has been parenting his mother, watching her depression progress, trying to fix it.  Will runs away from any human emotions...  (Although Will finds babies and toddlers unappealing, I don't at all think this point makes him immature.  That idea comes from ""obsessed-with-children""-types that bully you to worship their demon-children, or get labeled awful things.)Anyway, you see the change these folks bring about in each other.  Maybe they each provide a safe place to bring about change.  Marcus finally has a place and a friend to talk about his things without anybody trying to control his thoughts.  Mom finally gets some realistic feedback on her parenting and mental health, plus somebody caring about her that knows the truth.  Will finally has a safe, land-mine free place to experiment with feelings, a buddy to pal around with, and grows some bravery.Other good films to watch with:  ""Whale Rider"", ""High Fidelity"" are other good personal growth films.",About a Boy

799146,"Having given the theatrical release of this movie 1 star, after viewing the DVD I can not say that my impressions have changed that much. In fact I can now clearly see why I did not like Revolutions and why many others did not like it either. The central problem with Revolutions is that bit-part actors and actresses are given leading roles that are immensely time consuming. So much so that everyone who made the first Matrix so good have literally been given a backseat to Niobi's driving skills or a token Kid that saves the day. Forget Morpheus's slick philosophical statements while dressed in black. Here he just wears a woolly jumper and sits around wondering just what is going on. Imagine if Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Lea where replaced at the end of the trilogy with Jabba the Hut, a Jawa, a Storm Trooper and an Ewok made the central focus characters? Would you like that? Well this is EXACTLY what Revolutions does! Zion is really what has gone wrong here. By expanding the depth of the Matrix story the filmmakers have missed the mark of what made the first Matrix so good and this is a problem for the audience. In short, and for all intensive purposes, Revolutions does not resemble the original movie in any way shape or form. In fact the only thing that Revolutions has in common with the original film is the characters. Now we have been introduced to a battle between the machines and Zion - in an environment where Neo will not be found... or Morpheus ... or Trinity... or Agent Smith. This battle sequence is the BIGGEST part of the film. So for thirty odd minutes or so you will certainly NOT be watching any form of the Matrix... but heck this was never about the Matrix in the first place. Reloaded and Revolutions where designed to move between plot banality and theme-park type experiences WITHOUT the metaphysical `thought' and `dialogue' that made the original Matrix what it was. You are paying to see a empty spectacle - nothing more, nothing less.Those who have done their homework will realize that the filmmakers have forgotten a lot and provided us with simple excuses so that they can bring on the next big special effects scene. Like I said already NEW CHARACTERS are introduced that serve very little function and are forgotten about just as quick. The Trainman appears as an important character and then... disappears. His whole scene at the start of the movie with Neo served absolutely NO PURPOSE. The Architect materializes briefly at the end for a few lines to try and consolidate everything. Persephone is back again with the Merovingian as if nothing is wrong after her releasing the Keymaker in Reloaded. The Twins who disappeared in Reloaded are obviously vaporized, because they are not here. What happens to Seraph? What happened to the Merovingian? They are here in Revolutions but don't expect they actually play an important role in much because whatever they say or do means nothing by the time the end credits role and here is also another problem. The ENDING of the original Matrix is so much better than Revolutions that the sequels seem pointless. But there we really have summed it up. This is a money making high budget sci-fi movie, end of story. People are going to watch it so why not experiment? Sadly that experiment does not pay off simply because it breaks too many rules... rules that the original Matrix created for us. The original Matrix was a high like no other. Reloaded was satisfactory and at least had some knockout action sequences with elements that where in the first Matrix and a few extra scenes here and there to help develop the story around Zion. Okay so the dance scene at the start was totally out of place but in Reloaded as soon as Neo met the Oracle it was the Matrix rocking like you mother from start to finish. Revolutions is NOTHING like Reloaded.Like we said questions that where created in Reloaded are left unanswered. What is it with the Indian family who take up almost fifteen minutes talking at the start of the film? The copout for replacing the Oracle with a new actress is explained in the worst possible way..... AND WHOEVER WROTE THE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE SHOULD HAVE HIS PAYCHECK REVOKED! What a cliche driven script! You will not believe the stereotype dialogue on display here! Watch Neo stand for a few minutes in stupidity as Bane, who sounds, talks and moves just like Agent Smith, almost has to tell Neo who he is before the penny drops with our savior character! Bill and Ted where on the screen for a few moments there. Sssshesshhh.....The bottom line here is that this film is a disaster. Even if it where like Reloaded it would have been an acceptable movie but it seems almost like some sort of Direct to Video type release on a big budget. It is very hard to describe what an utter disappointment this film was. It could possibly be one of worst mega-budget pictures ever made. Fans will feel downright conned. Those who are looking for popcorn fodder will probably find it okay-ish entertainment but if we wanted to watch okay-ish entertainment we would hope to find that somewhere else other than in one of the most expensive sci-fi films ever made!!!!! Thank God that the Lord of the Rings is there to redeem our faith in high-concept large budget fantasy films. Revolutions is a bad stain on the Matrix series - if not trilogies as a whole.

It has the voice talents of Joaquin Phoenix, and Micheal Clarke Duncan, and it is good for kids as it is for adults.The story is about Kenai, Denahi, and Sitka.

But when the villiage shaman Tanana gives him the totem of love he is very disappointed. But he goes on a journey when a bear takes a basket of fish that he was supposed to guard. While finding it, he has an encounter with a giant bear. His other two brothers find Kenai, but while trying to stop the bear, Sitka ends up dying. Kenai wants his revenge, and he goes on a mission to destroy the bear. But the ghost of Sitka wants Kenai to live to his totem, and he turns him into a bear. Thr problem is that Denahi thinks that the bear not only killed Sitka, but also Kenai, and he looks for revenge.Kenai learns that he will have to go to where the light touches the Earth to talk about him being a bear with Sitka. He goes a journey and meets Koda, a young bear cub, who was seprated from his mother when hunters attacked them. He also meets two moose named Rutt and Tuck. Kenai does not want Koda to hang around with him, but when he learns that Koda knows where the light touches the Earth, he decides to let him stick around. Throughout his journey, he learns more about what it is like to be a bear, and what Sitka wanted him to learn. This all leads up to a tragic discovery, and the problem with Danahi, and how he following them, looking for revenge.""Brother Bear"" was a fun, quick, time at the movies, but if your looking for a better animated film either rent ""Finding Nemo"" or see ""The Triplets of Belleville."" It was funny and sweet, but its problem is that it is a regular Disney movie. It's has similiar qualites to ""Bambi"" and ""Dumbo"" and even ""Finding Nemo."" I only wish that Disney would start getting a new story idea. It's more of a rental movie instead of seeing it in the theatre.

725244,"A nice sunrise opening is never explained, but it would make a good postcard.  We are told that 'family photos are almost always of the happy moments and show smiling faces.'  We don't take pictures of something we want to forget.In the case of a fire, after pets, people usually save their family photos.  In the early '60s, I lived in an apartment building in the historic West Hill area of Pulaski, TN, where a fire started in the walls between the floors.  A neighbor sat down placidly to look at her photo albums, which I thought strange at the time.  I was busy getting my baby and cat and run down the stairs to deposit them on another neighbor's sofa.Sy has worked in a photo developing department of a store for 20 years and it is his life.  He gives special treatment to customers he likes, sometimes a free disposable camers as a birthday gift.He is a loner who ""adopts"" the Yorkin family.  Similarly, Miss Barnes, a spinster librarian at the college where we were, had considered me and mine as her surrogate family.  It is so sad when you have no one in your life, no one who really cares.He lives vicariously through the photos he personally handled (sometimes making a copy for himself) for nine years.  He tells the waitress at a seedy restaurant where he eats alone that the child is his nephew.  He collects all kinds of old photographs of people he doesn't know.  One was a Senior High picture of a girl taken in the '50s which he pretended was of his mother.His narration at intervals throughout the movie was most informative, such as, ""I was here; I existed.  Someone cared enough about me to take my picture.""In fact, he took one of himself at the end of one of the Yorkins' roll so they would see it.  He explained that a snapshot is a hurried shot taken without deliberate aim; a hunting term.  When I take photos, I always aim with an eye for a good background and sometimes abandon the shot if the background is not what I want.Sy gets a little too personal in his comments about their lovely home when he encounters the husband in the store one day.  A fantastic tree (such as the large one which grows outside my window) is shown at the Yorkin's front door.  He ""visits"" when they are not at home and makes himself 'at home' with a beer watching t.v. and even using the bathroom.  One day they catch him there and pretend he was expected.He observes a family coming apart emotionally with lots of interpersonal and financial problems, while Sy sits alone watching the Simpsons on t.v. and looking at his wall covered with snapshots of this young family.  He shadows the family wherever they go, even sits in the bar reading Deepak Chopra's THE PATHS TO LOVE as he knows that Ms. Yorkin is also reading this book.  He quotes a passage of Chopra's Eastern philosophy:  ""The things we fear the most have already happened to us.""From his voyeurism (looking through a set of intimate photos a young girl left to be developed), he discovers the adulterous behavior of Jake's father.  As a result, he inserts them into the envelope for some rather silly snaps the child took with his 'free' camera.He has made hundreds of copies of other photos without paying and, as a result, gets fired.  I liked the scene where he sits dejectedly on a bed in the store with a Kitty pillow.  Pathologically, he withdraws and his personality changes.  He sits in a corner on the floor and smiles at the atrocious assortment of snaps Jake took which Sy developed as his last 'job.'As he leaves on his final day of work, he steals a long butcher knife.  He follows as the Yorkins retrieved the photos to observe the wife's hurt and torment when she sees the evidence of her husband's infidelity.  He even goes so far as to hide and take pictures of the family through a large picture window as they go through the normality of a meal.  The purloined revealing, sexy photos didn't have the lasting effect he'd hoped for.He is clever in his demented state as he sets out to make things right for his beloved ""adopted"" family.  He tracks the philandering husband with his mistress to a hotel and maneuvers to get a room on the same floor.  He tortures the nude couple as he photographs them in sordid situations.He has committed a criminal act previously, by taking photos of his manager's young daughter.  Gary Cole was good as the manager who had to fire him.  He was marvelous in the t.v. series AMERICAN GOTHIC.  He has invated their existence and subsequently indirectly threatened the child's life.  The police are called and discover the wall of photographs which Sy has defaced by scratching the face of the husband in each one.He is able to delude them by intervening through a conference on 'retinal implants' at the hotel and escapes through the kitchen.  He runs like the athlete he never was, down the garage ramps.  But gets caught nevertheless.  He'd left the unused knife behind in room 519 and says, ""I just took pictures.""On the surface, Jake's dad looks the same but nothing will ever be the same.  Is this man smart enough to appreciate the good he has?  Or will he continue to cheat on his wife and neglect his son.  No one will ever be the same.Sy was harmed emotionallly by some of the content of photographs he'd developed for fifteen years.  Seeing some of the things people did to their children had left lasting damage to his psyche.  He ended up with stupid photos of inanimate objects that only a crazy person would take.  The scene where his nightmare showed blood gushing from his eyes had set him on a trail of depravity.Did this move have any redeeming quality?  I didn't see any, but this is one film it will take me a long time to forget.  Sorta like PSYCHO.  I guess that stands for something in the long run of things; perhaps a lesson was learned after all.",N/A
822544,"Patrick Swayze makes little more than a guest appearance in ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,"" the misbegotten ""sequel"" to the 1987 box office smash that turned the actor into a bona fide movie star.This time around the focus is on Katey Miller (Romola Garai), a high school senior who moves with her family to Cuba in 1958, right on the eve of the Castro revolution.  While there, she goes from being a white-bread, college-bound bookworm to a hot-blooded Latin dancer under the tutelage of a young Cuban (""Y Tu Mama Tambien""'s Diego Luna) who works poolside at the hotel where she and many other Americans live. Naturally, her cavorting around with a dark-skinned native raises a whole host of hackles among the snooty foreigners who live only to feed off the sweat and hard work of the indigenous population.Naturally, it is the dancing that is the key element in a film of this type, but even the choreography, which isn`t really all that impressive to begin with, can't overcome the film's humdrum storyline, shallow characterizations and infantile view of international politics.  The complexities of the Cuban revolution are glossed over in favor of soap opera mechanics and corny melodramatics.  As ""Doctor Zhivago"" proved long ago (only better), there's nothing like a governmental overthrow to put a little sizzle into your love life.As noted earlier, Swayze stops by briefly to reprise his role as Johnny Castle, providing Katie with a few words of wisdom and encouragement and showing her a few nifty dance moves before sending her on her way.  I hope Swayze was paid well for his efforts, but it seems a bit demeaning for a star of Swayze's caliber to be treated in so ungrateful and cavalier a fashion.  The irony is that the film would have been far more interesting had it focused on Castle instead of Katie, but it's obvious that the studio executives who green lighted this project weren't about to bankroll a dance film with a middle-aged actor in the lead role.  That ""Shall We Dance?"" will wind up doing far better at the box office than ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" may provide some sweet vindication not only for Swayze but for all the fans of the original film for which this sequel was allegedly made.",Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights
158097,"I can't believe how much Carrie Fisher sounds like Margot Kidder nowadays.  Anyway, the original Star Wars Trilogy (sort of) is finally on DVD.  Yes, these are the Special Editions (sort of).  Even more changes have been made here.  I consider myself a moderate Star Wars fan: I enjoy the films and the video games, and I still collect some of the action figures, but I don't read all the books, sleep on Star Wars sheets, dress up like characters from the films, or anything like that.  There was a time when I was younger that I would've been very much against the idea of altering these films, but now that I'm older I feel that Lucas should be able to (for better or worse) modify his films (he would say ""complete"" them), but I also think the originals should be available for those who fell in love with them back in the day.Anyway, on to the films.  They look and sound great, and most of the changes don't alter the films in a negative way.  I like the addition of the Jabba scene in the original Star Wars, and they've improved the CGI to make him look more like he does in Episode I.  Unfortunately however, Greedo still shoots first in this version, and even though it's been improved a bit, it still looks bad, and still changes the story for the worse (in my opinion).  This is my single least favorite change in the whole trilogy.One other change that has some fans angry is the substitution of Hayden Christensen at the end of Return Of The Jedi: now, instead of seeing the spirit of an older Anakin, we see young Anakin...looking kind of creepy no less (though it would explain why old Anakin's body doesn't disappear when he dies if it was young Anakin who became one with the force).At any rate, this is a great set, and the bonus disc has (among other things) a great documentary on the making of the trilogy that will surprise a lot of long-time fans.I recommend this DVD set, though hopefully someday the original versions of these films will be released for those who want them.",Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition

562795,"Telling fans of the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; series that &quot;Samurai X: Betrayal,&quot; the second half of a four-episode anime mini-series is where we find out why Kenshin has that &quot;X&quot; shaped scar on his face should be enough to get them to check out this prequel.  The story is set in 19th-century Japan and in the first half, &quot;Samurai X: Trust,&quot; Shinta, a young man sold into slavery after his parents died, is trained by the mystic swordsman in Japan to be the most feared assassin in Japan and given the name Kenshin.  When he grows up our young hero meets Tomoe Yukishiro, a mysterious young woman whose fianc&eacute; had been murdered by Kenshin.This DVD of &quot;Romantic Tales from the Meiji Era&quot; includes &quot;Act 3: The Previous Night at the Mountain Home&quot; and &quot;Act 4: The Cross-Shaped Wound.&quot;  In Act 3 Kenshin tries to live a life of peace that is at odds with his brutal life as he and Tomoe hide out in Otsu, posing as a simple farmer and his wife.  Kenshin even thinks of making the fantasy real, although there does not seem to be any reason for him to fall in love with the mysterious Tomoe, but then the &quot;traitor&quot; is revealed to Kenshin, setting up the tragic end game in Act 4.  As the title indicates, this is where we learn how Kenshin received his distinctive wound and the most impressive part of the tale is that writer Nobuhiro Watsuki and director Kazuhiro Furuhashi come up with something that is both surprising and lyrical.  You might have trouble reconciling the contemplative Keshin we see at the end of &quot;Samurai X&quot; with the more childlike one of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin,&quot; but it is hard to deny the power of this story.I think watching &quot;Samurai X&quot; after enjoying &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is the correct order for viewing, even though it is the prequel to the series.  There are profound differences between the two, with &quot;Samurai X&quot; being more sophisticated that the series, with the violence heightened and the comic elements stripped away.  The prequel is not intended for young viewers, even if they are fans of the series, because even though we all know that Kenshin becomes the &quot;Hitokiri Battousai&quot; (i.e., &quot;the man who slashes even as he draws his sword&quot;), his being an assassin constitutes an even darker chapter in his early life.",Samurai X - Betrayal
266783,"Surely one of the greatest and most accomplished films of the 20th Century was ""All About Eve."" Produced and released precisely halfway through the Century in 1950, the film is a classic of awesome proportions and deservedly earnt 14 Oscar Nominations (the most ever for a single film) and won six. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, with an all-star cast and some of the most intelligent and witty dialogue in movie history, this film is without a doubt a classic in its genre. It simply is a black and white motion picture masterpiece that saw Bette Davis at the pinnacle of her career and also gave a worthy screen debut for a bright new actress who would go on to become a legend in her own right, and earn her title as the most famous screen actress in history.The story opens with young Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) who is a 24 year old obsessed theatregoer and a fanatic of the glamorous and successful stage diva Margo Channing (Bette Davis). She goes to all her shows and sits transfixed by her idol. One evening after a show, Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) spots Eve and insists she meet up with Margo. The two meet, along with Margo's lover Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) and the playwright Lloyd Richards (Hugh Harlowe) who is also the husband of Karen. Eve tells her tragic life history and soon worms her way into Margo's life. She appoints her to live with her as a sort of assistant, and soon the pair become great friends. Everyone loves Eve, with the exception of Margo's first maid Birdie Coonan (Thelma Ritter) who has some of film's sharpest dialogue.However, after a while, the people who grew to love Eve soon begin to see her for what she really is: a mischievous and twisted actress who will do anything to become the newest Hollywood star. Her evil and vindictive ways become clearer over the course of the movie, and none other than a sharp theatre-critics Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) picks her up and agrees to make her the starlet she has always wanted to be, but there's a price. Soon enough, the claws are out and Margo struggles to maintain her role as the nation's idol. She's pushing on into her 40's and new, younger flesh is coming up and giving her a ride for her money. A battle for theatre supremacy ensues, culminating in Eve's undoing and Margo's completion.It's not hard to see why this film is such a classic and won so many Academy Awards when you have Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in their respective roles as Anne and Margo. Baxter is ideal for the role because of her charming and photogenic appeal. She is such a cute and seemingly innocent little girl that even when you realise underneath that exterior she's an evil and conniving madam, you still wait for her to change back to the ideal. The two roles fit the actresses perfectly live gloves, but it's Davis who really propels this film into the timeless movie stratosphere. Her honesty and devotion to the role is incredible - and so believable. It's not hard to see why she's a gay icon and one of the Top 10 greatest actresses of all time when you see this film. As if all this wasn't enough, a fresh-faced new starlet called Marilyn Monroe (ever heard of her?) makes her screen debut. It's amazing to see this young 24 year old on screen in such a small role as Miss Caswell, and to think of what she would go on to achieve over the next 12 years of her superstar lifestyle.This is a film with no special effects, hardly any outdoor scenes and no fancy stage props at all. Everything is filmed in black and white and 90% of the film is talking, but this is precisely the best part. The dialogue is served up in chunky slices of bitchiness and backstabbing and features some very famous one-liners. The characters are so believable in their roles that they completely absorb you and keep you focused on them, as you forget the surroundings and grip onto the groundbreaking (at the time) storyline that is unfolding. Who cares for special effects when you have such masterful dialogue like this?OVERALL GRADE: 10/10I cannot stress enough how enjoyable and brilliant this film is. It was on a UK cable channel early yesterday morning. I couldn't sleep because of a storm, so got up at 6:00am, went downstairs onto the couch with my duvet and turned on the TV to find this little gem, tucked away in the early hours. I was amazed and have since watched it three times. I'm not usually into black and white films (not many 17 year old boys are!) but after seeing this, I would definitely be interested in seeing more - especially ones starring Bette Davis!",N/A

Normally, ""super stars"" are major geeks in high school and its brutal sorting of personalities but then they learn to value themselves.Britney Spears failed to do so and the result is that terrifying emptiness we see in her eyes in Mike Moore's Fahrenheit 911, where she says we must obey the President in a dazed fashion, but generally speaking, ""stars"" who actually participate in the creation of these workout tapes have to contribute a modicum of real presence...as did the pioneer of these workouts, Jane Fonda.Of course, many people merely want the appearance and not the reality; there is something nasty about Britney's body which Cindy's doesn't share, because the former's regimen probably includes drugs to both keep pounds off, and numb her to the reality of her situation as a commodity.It might be thought that an aerobics tape of what Foucault called *technique de soi* is indeed a thin rail to support such ponderous (and lecherous) speculation.

621303,"Rarely would I give a movie a five star review.  Actually, this is my first.  Take it from me, the critics do not lie.  Spiderman 2 is an amazing achievement.  It is, in fact, as good, or better than the first.We pick up where we left off in the first film.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is battling his double duties as Spiderman and Peter Parker.  Still, at the same time, he is trying to cope with his love for the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  This would be the focus point of Spiderman 2.Peter's love for Mary Jane begins to take effect on his superhero obligations.  Back and forth, he begins to question his identity, feelings, and the everyday worries of job security, paying rent, etc.  All of his doubts, fears, and problems seem to revolve around, yes, Mary Jane.  He starts to lose focus as Spiderman and finds himself not able to use all of his gifts properly.  It eventually comes to the point where he decides it is time to give up being Spiderman in order to be able to be with the love of his life.Mary Jane is not the only returning member.  Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco) is back.  Harry still longs to avenge his father's death by killing Spiderman.  Here, Harry has turned darker by really obsessing with his nemesis and trying to drink his problems away.  Another reason for this is because of his failed attempt at phenomenal success with his genius scientis Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina).  Octavious' fusion experiment fails, but at the same time transfoms him into the villain Dr. Octopus, a man with four addtional limbs.  He later makes a deal with Harry in order to recreate an attempt at his fusion device.  This deal invloves bringing Spiderman to Harry so that he can finally seal the deal with his father's death.Doc Ock, as later called, and Spiderman encounter each other on numerous occassions.  The fight sequences are enjoyable to watch.  Although, I did not feel they were as good as Spiderman vs the Green Goblin, they are worth seeing.  Especially in stages where they are fighting while climbing skyscrapers.  There is also one action sequence on a train, which is probably the main battle.  It is really great to see on the big screen.There is also a break in the action.  As mentioned, Parker decides to give up his supehero identity.  We see shots of him going to school, being relaxed, eating ice cream, and so on.  However, all of this changes as soon as Mary Jane gets captured by Dr. Octopus.  This leads to the train fight mentioned above.In the end, Spidey and Dr. Octopus duke it out one last time and the girl is saved.  However, we later learn about a new possible villain for the next movie as Harry finds his father's secret hiding place that is complete with Green Goblin artifacts.Spiderman 2 is a really good movie.  One that is definitely worthy of the title ""summer blockbuster.""  Yet, the film is not about action.  Here, the story evolves around something much bigger.  In the first Spiderman, we caught a glimpse of the inner struggles of Peter Parker, here the come out in full force.  Watching the character grow, mature, and handle his problems makes the movie better.  Every superhero has a weakness.  That weakness can also equal strength.  Peter Parker finds that balance in this movie, and he is ready to swing back to theatres in 2007.",Spider-Man 2
782704,"Three great and one horrible episode of MST with new introductions featuring Mike for each are the contents of this set. The episodes in question are 'Space Mutiny', 'Girl in the Gold Boots', 'Hamlet', and 'Overdrawn at the Memory Bank'. I am ecstatic with the package as a whole, although I personally wish that they had never done 'Hamlet', and though I have seen it twice now, I doubt seriously that I will watch it again. On a brighter note the other three episodes are absolutely delightful.'Space Mutiny' features reused 'Battlestar Galactica' stock footage combined with interiors filmed in what appears to be a boiler room (but remember it's a futuristic spaceship!) The costumes, acting, and especially dialogue are hilarious and I never tire of seeing this episode. My favorite scene is the hula hoop dance in the nightclub which yields the following glorious chestnuts from the MST crew: &quot;So in the future there is absolutely no shame&quot;; and, &quot;She's presenting like a mandrill!&quot;'Girl in the Gold Boots' is a cheesy gangster/musical/dance movie straight out of the 1960s. Words can't describe the plot and the inane turns taken (the dune buggy scene in particular comes to mind here), so you'll just have to watch it for yourself. The dancing is particularly delicious to watch, as are the wretched musical numbers, particularly the closing tune, which provokes Mike to say &quot;So here's a puzzler: which of these two is worse at their craft?&quot; as the two stars dance and sing respectively.'Overdrawn at the Memory Bank' is the best argument I have ever seen against the NEA. This horrible made for PBS film starring the genuinely great Raul Julia concerns a misanthrope from the future stuck into the body of Daisy, a worn out old baboon (&quot;I'm Daisy; I like rotten fruit, poetry, and flinging my filth.&quot;) Of course everything goes horribly awry and Julia as 'Aram Fingal' has to fight to get out of the computer in a bad 'Casablanca' rip off. People either love or hate this episode, and I can see both sides of the issue. I personally fall into the former camp, so I am delighted it is now on DVD! Despite the horrible made for PBS special effects, and wretched storyline, the level of writing for the MST guys us near the peak of 'Manos' here. The anteater jokes alone make the film worth watching.'Hamlet' is a 1960 black and white German TV production badly dubbed into English, and truthfully is one of my all time least favorite episodes of MST. I find this episode to be virtually unwatchable.I hope that another volume comes out shortly, as one can never get enough MST.

81273,"Believe it or not, there was actually a time when the now famed ""Good Will Hunting"" was just the little-movie-that-could.  When it was released in the late 90s, America was under the mighty ""Titanic"" spell, and any actors who weren't named Leonardo or Winslett basically got ignored.  In fact, for what it's worth, the film was not a major blockbuster by anyone's standards.  The director, Gus Van Sant, had somewhat of a cult following (thanks to previous movies such as ""My Own Private Idaho"") but little else. Matt Damon (who plays the lead) and Ben Affleck (who plays his friend) were still Hollywood mid-carders. The only thing the film had going for it on a marketing level was Robin Williams.But low and behold, audiences began to click with it.  Damon and Williams had an on-screen chemistry that rivaled Leo's and Kate's, and the screenplay (written by Damon and Affleck in college) was...well, brilliant (it eventually won an oscar).In case you don't know, the film is about a troubled Boston youth (Damon) who is from the wrong side of town but posesses  a brilliant photographic academic mind.  Damon eventually begins seeing Williams, a therapist, and the story goes from there.  The tone and theme are very academic and carpe-diem, similar to another Robin Williams film, ""Dead Poets Society,"" but with a more gritty edge. It also seems influenced by the classic Peter Schaffer play, Equus (probably a mere coincidence, though) in that the film straddles the theme of the therapist ultimately becoming the patient, and vice versa.The film has achieved somewhat legendary status among college students over the years as THE inspiring story about love, friendship, loyalty, and plunging into the real world. Whatever the case, if it wasn't for this movie, Damon and Affleck would most likely not be where they are today.

Blade Runner, where's the original? I don't want Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but want the other two, Ark and Crusade.

258716,"Wow, words can not describe how marvelous this film is. I was captivated from beggining to end. This movie quickly became one of my favorite films of all time! Directed by Peter Weir and written by Tom Schulman, two men who accept the Blakean view that no bird soars too high if he soars with his own two wings. In a rousing performance, Robin Williams stars as John Keating who in the fall of 1959 arrives at Welton Academy, a private boy's prep school, to teach English. Exemplifying his philosophy of strident individualism, this charismatic and unconventional teacher tells his students to seize the day and make their lives extraordinary. Keating's passion for poetry inspires some of his students to revive a secret club that he led when he was a student at the Academy. They gather in a cave to read poetry aloud and share their creative efforts. Among those who are most deeply influenced by Keating are Robert Sean Leonard as a boy who defies his father's orders and plays Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Ethan Hawke as a reclusive lad who learns to stand up for what he believes in, and Josh Charles as a love-sick student who uses poetry to woo a seemingly unattainable girl away from her football star boyfriend. Keating's ardent belief that words and ideas can change the world turns out to be true when a tragedy rocks the Academy and the conservative play-it-by-the-book administration make him into the scapegoat. His best students now become rebels with a cause. Dead Poets Society celebrates nonconformity and freethinking as an adventure worthy of emulation and as some of us know, that subject isn't one of your usual movie theme these days. The tale's dramatic finale will send you through an emotional rollercoaster ride. Definately an absolute must see!!!!",N/A
424192,"This has to be one of the most flagrantly biased and dishonest documentaries ever to air on American television.  It is a non-stop marathon of philo-totalitarianism, apologetics for tyranny, whitewashing of mass murder, and outright lies, such as claiming the Khmer Rouge were American supported.  (They only recieved American assistance when they were out of power and a small part of an ad hoc group of armed bands harassing the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia; during their oft-denied - by anti-war leftists like Noam Chomsky - autogenocide of millions of their own citizens, the Khmer Rouge were squarely in the communist bloc.)  There is an excellent overview of some of the - failed - attempts by other filmmakers to provide balance or rebuttal to this ugly piece of work in the book PBS:BEHIND THE SCREEN, which is highly recommended to anyone who wants an objective look at how public broadcasting conducts itself.  This film is more than bad, it is a morally vile apologia for the tyrannical subjugation of an entire country and the murder or exile of well over a million people, and the demonization of those - American and Vietnamese alike - who sought to prevent precisely that eventuality.  This film is the moral equivalent of Holocaust denial, and ought to viewed as such by anyone who watches it.",Vietnam - A Television History VHS
476787,"Cabaret Balkan--aka The Powder Keg--is exactly both a dark and garish show with black, black humor and a society about to blow.The film takes place one night in Belgrade, still the rump Yugoslavia (the film was made before the bombing in 1999.)  A group of random characters all interact violently.The relationships cover the full range of emotions: a couple is reunited after he left during the war, a couple is terrorized by a Che Guevara-esque guy and his teen goon, a man goes mental after his old VW is dented by a punk, and in the most impressive sequence, and by far the most disturbing, two old friends spar in a gym and begin to reveal past wrongs against each other.  When hanky-panky with the wife is mentioned, the rage is palpable.Not a few people are murdered, many are terrorized, and a general sense of desperation hangs over the city.  The film is a cry that Yugoslavia needs help, it is preying on itself.  The film is menacing.  Many of the scenes highlight the degradation of someone by angry, vengeful, sick, and frustrated people.This is probably no more a bizarre collage of tales than a Saturday night in Manhattan, but the context--late in the Milosevic regime, before he really brought the house down--is (now from hindsight) all the more biting.  You can't imagine a sequel where, on top of the general ugliness, the city gets bombed (though the last sequence kind of predicts it.)  You watch and say, how can it get that bad?  Then you realize: it got worse.This needs to get out on DVD.  While Milosevic is gone, this film is still brutal.","Cabaret Balkan ""Bure Baruta""  VHS"

REO opened at an outside fair grounds and Styx followed. Just a few minutes into Styx set, a storm blew in and the sound board was ""toast"". They tried to complete the show, but mother nature wasn't going to allow it. They tried to let the show go on by using the stage monitors and acoustic guitars. Luckily, we were in the front row and could hear them, but no one in the bleachers heard a sound and the band finally conceded that the  concert was over.This is a very good concert, but I felt like they should have made this program a two DVD set, so more of each bands material could have been added. My biggest regret is that Styx didn't get Crystal Ball included. Again, other than not covering more songs, this is a fun DVD to add to your collection.",N/A
697782,"Gene Hackman never fails to amaze me!. He always seems to be in films which are quite challenging and mostly unorthodox. This film does not follow usual studio formula story of dysfunctional family with a happy ending. Oh no, this is a comedy with some quite tragic elements underpinning it. One scene depicts an attempted suicide and it is not for the faint hearted.Hackman plays the character of a psychopathic confidence trickster extremely well. He renews contact with his family and makes concerted efforts to weasle his way back in ostensibly to have a roof over his head when he hits hard times. The most amazing element is his attempt to seek redemption from those he has wronged. Hackman acts this part so well that I could not help being drawn in by his charm.Also check out Danny Glover's performance who makes valiant attempts to thwart him.The narrative is reminiscent of the Magnificent Ambersons and I am sure that this film pays homage to that flawed masterpiece.The ending of Tenebaums is not easy but it reaches a perfect resolution.",The Royal Tenenbaums

After episodes after episodes with some good and bad plots, the first series really made me look forward to the next, then the movie. After it's emmy win, this show was the most watched on early 90s, but got stale after a bit, but then ends in a dramatic and shocking way, great.If you remember watching this alone at home in 93, in your lonely home in the woods, and felt that fright, you should get this dvd and relive it.

731059,"&quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; actor-writer-director Edward Burns' attempt at an urban thriller, works beautifully as a mood piece but fails to be fully convincing as a crime drama. Set in the early 1980s in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen section, &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is about Francis Sullivan, a young Irish mobster trying to go straight, and what happens when his brother Sean--supposedly killed by rival thugs after whacking three of their crew--suddenly reappears after three years. Burns marinates us in the color and flavor of the gritty neighborhood--the photography, a palette of browns and grays, sets an intriguing tone, and David Shire's moody, jazzy piano score is a wow. But all the detail in the world can't hide the basic thinness of the story. We've seen variations on this story a thousand times before--from &quot;Public Enemy&quot; to &quot;Mean Streets&quot;--and Burns has nothing new to add. The cast is great--besides Burns as Francis, you have Elijah Wood as Sean and Rosario Dawson, Malachy McCourt, Oliver Platt and others in supporting roles. But although the actors give their all, we never feel we have enough background about the characters for them to really come to life. And the ending, meant to be a shocker, merely seems gratuitous. In all, the best you can say about &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is that it's an interesting disappointment. (Another disappointment: I wanted to buy the soundtrack CD for &quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; but discovered on this website that it contains NONE of Shire's outstanding music--only the songs on the jukebox in the characters' favorite hangout. If you want a collection of the greatest hits of Lynyrd Skynyrd, BTO, The Kinks, etc., this is probably a good buy, but if you want Shire's music, this is a REAL letdown.)",Ash Wednesday

It's not the same old songs they repeat in many of their other videos, and these songs are just as catchy as the earlier ""classics"". As far as having repeated material on their TV show that another reviewer mentioned, that's the whole success of the Wiggles branding.

757583,"Junko Aoki is a quiet young woman who keeps herself to herself. She is seemingly aloof from her co-workers where she works who in turn treat her badly and make fun of her because of this.What they don't know is that Junko's aloofness is born out of a terrible secret she keeps deep inside herself, a secret so frightening, so terrifying it has the ability to kill if Junko is ever roused to anger.Junko is cursed with the power of pyrokinesis, the ability to start terrible fires at will. This power is hereditary and from childhood she has been warned by her anxious mother never to give into her anger because of what will happen if she does.However as a defenceless child Junko was forced to kill a boy who tried to attack her and she has never forgotten the terror she felt as she saw the youth explode into flames and die before her eyes.It is this memory that makes Junko so aloof and distant from her fellow workers,  however she is lonely and when she is befriended by the gentle Mr Tada, a fellow office worker, she lets her defences down for the first time since she was a child, falls in love with him and becomes close to his teenage sister, the lively and loving Yukie.When Yukie is cruelly murdered by a group of young men making Snuff Films for kicks, Junko's fire born rage is ignited and she reveals to her friend Mr Tada the terrible gift she has harboured within her since birth.At first Mr Tada is consumed by the need to revenge his younger sister's death but when he sees one of the murderers catch light and the agony and pain such a fiery end causes, he momentarily backs away from Junko, unable to continue with his quest. He is confused and unsure of what he wants in the way of retribution for his beloved sister's death.Junko is also being doggedly tracked by a sympathetic female Police Officer, Kaori whose sense of humour is wonderfully dry and brittle, especially when unexplained fires flare up along with her male junior colleague who just might have a terrible link to Junko from a past the young woman would rather forget.Junko though is out for revenge, especially when a stranger gives her tape of Yukie's death and she sets out on a journey which could ultimately lead to both her redemption and destruction.There are many poignant moments in this movie like when Junko tries to have a family life with a young girl who has similar powers to her own, and her memories of her mother's warnings about the power she possesses within. Some of the last scenes are the most memorable and touching and there is a strange beauty if the violence of fire.The plot has many twists in it, and some of them you don't expect which makes the movie all the more exciting and watchable.All the characters are larger than life but are also incredibly subtle and the actresses playing Junko and Kaori steal the show with their strength and vulnerability.This movie is very reminiscent of Stephen King's book and film Firestarter; this movie however is far superior, in acting, special effects, the musical score and the twists and turns of a complex but thrilling plot.Some people might be put off by the fact that the film is in Japanese and has subtitles, take it from me, it makes no difference whatsoever to the quality of the film.This is a brilliant movie, and well worth borrowing from your local library (if they have it) or buying it and sitting down to an excellent evening of fire, blood, tears and brimstone.",Pyrokinesis

380023,"To those who have not experienced the world of hard core street drugs and the violent consuming grip they can have, I point to this movie as maybe the quintessential performance of an individual addict. Trainspotting and other movies may cover a drug, or a lifestyle better, but nothing captures the tragedy of an individual like DiCaprio's performance in Basketball Diaries.  The defining moment is DiCaprio, pounding on his mother's door, begging for $20 so that he can score just one more hit.  His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, huddles on the other side of the door, crying, and fighting the maternal instincts to help her son, when she knows he can not be helped.  The cry that Leo gives out, as he pulls his cap down over his face in frustration, a sixteen-year-old crying for his mommy, because it all hurts too much to cope.  That is the face of addiction.  DiCaprio's cry comes from his belly, the whiny tantrum cry of a four-year-old who just can't understand why he can't get his way.  And yet, underneath that, one gets the sensation of the turmoil and pain within his heart, and the ultimate sadness that eats away at him.This movie introduced me to the beautiful and edgy work of Jim Carroll, the star of the latest Beat generation.  His story is so captivatingly told through the performance of DiCaprio.  However, the supporting cast is also spectacular.  Mark Wahlberg deliveres a great support perfomance, as a cohort in drug addiction, helping to supply pills, glue, heroin, and the like.Keep an eye out for an early performance by Michael Imperioli, of Sopranos fame, playing a teammate of DiCaprio and Wahlberg, who passes away during the film.  Yet one more devastating event in Carroll's life.There are some stylistic choices made by the director that may not fit with some people, but they are only a minor detail in a very powerful and honest film.",Basketball Diaries VHS
668264,"The first thing you have to do when watching a ""Friday the 13th"" film is to jettison all expectations of artistic integrity or profound social commentary. This is the series, after all, that defined mindless shock-value entertainment for the better part of twenty years.""Jason Lives"" at least attempts to give fans some genuine scares and some old school action  as it's repetitive storyline unfolds. Yes, I said repetitive. Let's not kid ourselves, people-whether he's sporting a burlap sack ala' the Elephant man or terrorizing a collection of 23rd century hormonally driven twentysomethings, each and every one of Jason's horror outings have the exact same plot. A group of six to twelve people show up. Jason also shows up. Said people are systematically slaughtered. Jason does the slaughtering. One person, usually female, ends up putting a stop to the carnage by dispatching the hockey masked zombie (""for now...""). The difference this time is that ""Jason Lives"" - with it's dark foreboding forests, thick with fog and shadows - looks and feels like a classic monster movie. There is no attempt whatsoever to mask the identity of the killer here ( a plot device that was wearying when they used it as late in the series as part five...why bother with shots of the killer that avoid showing his face? Like we don't know its Jason?). Director Tom Mcloughlin knows that we know who the villian is and what he's going to do to these people, so he simply opens the film with a bravura ressurection sequence ( set in a  masterfully designed cemetary ) and never lets up. Along the way there are a few humorous nods (the best being an opening sequence that parodies the famous ""gun barrel"" walk that opens every  James Bond film), as well as some of the better visual effects that have graced this series (the RV sequence is a doozy). Ultimately, you get what you pay for, and in terms of what the fans of these films expect, this one has a lot of style and is better than average. Besides, you've got to love any movie that treats us to the sight of ""Horseshack"" from ""Welcome Back Kotter"" having his heart torn out.

I am one who seeks out widescreen DVDs rather than full screen, and I found the picture and sound quality to be nearly identical to what I experienced upon first seeing the movie in the theatre. Those who found the movie ""too dark"" or had trouble understanding some of the dialogue will no doubt have the same criticism of the DVD presentation, but neither were a problem for me. The bonus material is excellent in my opinion. I particularly enjoyed the made-for-DVD documentary ""The Hundred Days,"" which takes the viewer behind the scenes of the making of the movie, and ""In The Wake of O'Brian,"" a shorter documentary where Weir answers some of the questions about the focus of the movie that bothered many devotees of the canon. There are also short documentaries that cover the battle scenes, audio effects, and the storm scene, which are of especial interest to movie buffs. There is a companion booklet that would be helpful for those not familiar with the series and/or the careers of Peter Weir and Patrick O'Brian.

348126,"On its surface, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; is a light farce involving the couplings - and decouplings - of an assortment of weekend guests staying at the chateau of the Comte de la Cheyniest (Marcel Dalio).  Without knowing any other context, the film can be enjoyed on this level: Renoir's writing (he co-scripted) is witty and his direction is elegant and sublime. His fluid long-shots make you feel like you're gliding along in this rarified - though topsy-turvy - world; and his open approach to the actors is suffused with generosity.  He never allows us to focus on one particular person, or couple, because, in this social world, &quot;everyone has their reasons&quot; and everyone's actions bounce and intertwine with everyone else's.As a homage and updating of a classic French farce, &quot;Rules&quot; is flawless; it is, however, as a commentary on the decline of a social order that makes this more than a cinematic souffle.  Shot in 1939, &quot;between Munich and the War&quot; as Renoir says, the film is portrait of the European aristocracy where ethical codes (conjugal fidelity above all) are not only violated, but are even dismissed as irrelevant.  Human relationships collapse and reform with sudden ease (witness the gameskeeper and the poacher) and those who cling to outmoded notions of love and faithfulness set themselves up for disaster (such as the aviator).  This is the domestic complement to Renoir's war drama, &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, where the mournful French and German artistocratic officers, having more in common amongst themselves than with the common soldiers of their respective nationalities, lament that mechanized warfare has rendered their class irrelevant.Both &quot;Illusion&quot; and &quot;Rules&quot; may seem irrelevant themselves in the US, which did not have a traditional feudal aristocracy.  Yet both films fascinate by showing individuals attempting to survive, and thrive, in worlds where the old, comfortable standards no longer apply.  If the aristocrats in &quot;Rules&quot; openly, and rather disinterestedly, conduct affairs with each others' spouses, why shouldn't a humble poacher poach a gameskeeper's wife too?  If &quot;everyone has their reasons&quot;, the famous quote from the film, then, who's to decide which &quot;reasons&quot; are justified or unjust, legitimate or scandalous?The Criterion double-disc sets its own standards.  The extras are plentiful and fascinating, including interviews from the few remaining cast and crew members, the essay booklet intelligent and penetrating, and the transfer quality of the film is superb considering the film's history (having been cut at its premiere, banned, its original negative destroyed in WWII, and finally reassembled in the late 1950's).

He tells the Weather Board that something is wrong with the weather patterns, leading to Global Warming and Cooling. He also has the theory that the next ice age might not be too far off. Yup. His (HOT) son (Jake Gyllenhaal) flys to New York for a school competition, and that;s where the trouble starts. Upon his arrival, it is raining cats and dogs, leading to a massive flood, which sends everyone in Ney York to the highest point in the city manageable. The library. There,  there is the question of whether to stay or go, considering the condition. The majority leaves, leaving about ten people. It was a good idea to stay, too.

778373,"&quot;Born to Be Bad&quot; is a very uncharacteristic Cary Grant movie. Uncharacteristic because it's at the beginning of his career, features him in an almost non-comedic role and has him cast as a man double-crossed by a woman of easy virtue in an almost maudelin plot. The story concerns Grant hitting the son of a woman of easy virtue (Loretta Young) with his car. He then having to make the mends. The rest is pure melodrama but pulled off with such panache that you'd scarcely mind any of the hockum. Truly, this is a very, very good movie.TRANSFER: Unfortunately the same can't be said for FOX's transfer. We get a very dirty, very gritty, very grainy transfer that - although free of digital anomalies - is so heavily damanged by age that seeing the film is hardly worth the effort. Black and contrast levels are extremely weak, fine detail is lost in practically every scene and the ravages of time are glaring and obvious throughout. The audio hasn't been cleaned up either for a slight hiss and some unexpected pops along the way.EXTRAS: Trailers from the other Grant films. Boring, unworthy and disappointing.BOTTOM LINE: Someone should point out to studio executives that films pre-Star Wars are worth the time, effort and, oh yes, the MONEY that is required to make them sparkle like they did when they were premiered. Really, history is getting shafted here!!!",Born To Be Bad

(1/5)New Foundation vs. Orient Express was the best match opf the night so far and that's not saying much but still it was very good.  The New Foundation picks up the win. (3.5/5)Beverly Brothers vs. The Bushwhackers was as boring as boring gets and I literally almost fell asleep.  The Beverly Brothers win and I don't care. (0/5)Royal Rumble Match for the World Title.  Everybody says this was the greatest Rumble ever nope that goes to 2004 believe it or not.  Flair wins the Rumble and he is the new World Champion.

320453,"Charles Chaplin was the greatst cinematic genius of the 20th century. His brilliance was celebrated and recognized for decades, but then America brutally turned against him. How it grieved him that his adopted homeland, the country that had given him fame, riches and untold fortune, denounced him as a Communist and basically didn't allow him back into the country. What a singular disgrace. His story is told magnificently in these four films, spanning thirty years. We open up with the little tramp and conclude with the haunting, depressing, yet poignant &quot;Limelight.&quot; This last film is my favorite of them all, with Charlie's unique, beautiful voice speaking so softly to a 19 year-old Claire Bloom. It was send chills down your spine to see his work (finally) restored to its original glory. The final scene, with Keaton standing behind, when they slowly draw the sheet over his face signifies the artistic death of Charlie Chaplin. No one went out with more grace and pathos.If you're a long-time Chaplin fan or a Charlie newbie, this set has something for everyone, from the globe dance in &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; to the depressing scenes of Calvero unable to make his audience laugh anymore. It's all here and it will touch anyone with a love of film. There was only Chaplin and this set shows the entire spectrum. My highest recommendation.",N/A
146550,"One of the hardest parts about writing a review of a film I love is conveying my feelings into written words.  Why does the music in this movie haunt me?  Why do the characters seem so real and why does the Tall Man seem so scary?  He is just a tall, older man, but he is creepy to the extreme.  I can't tell you why, but I know these things to be true.Phantasm has a wildly imaginative story; one of the most original ideas for a horror film in ANY decade.  Two brothers and their ice cream vending friend face down a tall, gaunt, creepy, mortician and his army of hooded dwarves (called &quot;Jawas&quot; by many because of their resemblance to the Star Wars critters, even though the Phantasm creatures were actually designed first).  The Morningside Funeral Home is creepy in itself (the house they used is the same one featured in Burnt Offerings). The Tall Man's arsenal also includes the infamous &quot;Spheres&quot; which fly thru the halls of the funeral home, guarding against intruders and viciously eliminating anyone who gets in the way.  What at first looks like another undead movie turns into more of a sci-fi premise when the origin of the Tall Man is partially revealed (the full origin has still only been hinted at after 4 films).The name Phantasm hints at the dream-like unreality that saturates the story, music, direction, and cinematography.  By the end you are left not knowing exactly what was real and what was a dream as the red lettering of the credits appear.Phantasm's synth score adds so much to the film.  I cannot stress this enough.  Even in scenes not actively trying to scare you, the haunting music carries you along, never letting you lose the uneasiness the movie has already built up.The special edition DVD is a great package with a commentary track featuring the director and 3 primary actors, PLUS Angus Scrimm (the Tall Man) is in the commentary too, even though he is not listed for some reason.  Scrimm also introduces the movie in a rather hammy chat with the audience.  Special features also include trailers and an extensive gallery of promotional materials from it's theatrical release.  I hate to mention &quot;interactive menus&quot; because I don't see them as an actual feature, but the menus on the Special Edition DVD are fantastic.  Accompanied by the great music of the film, the menus are easy to navigate and have an interesting design.  Chapters are presented inside graphics of the spheres and are animated to you can see the exact scene as it plays out.  The 4th Phantasm film, Phantasm: Oblivion, used a lot of deleted scenes from the original movie in it's time hopping sequences.  This DVD includes even more deleted material not shown in the past-scenes of the 4th movie.  They must have cut a ton of stuff from this.  Most of the scenes are character scenes and give you more reason to like the characters.  Well worth a look.Amazon lists this DVD as out of print.  If you don't have it, find it any way you can.  Maybe it will be released again in a new form, but I can't see them improving on this great DVD.",N/A

405942,"I first saw this film shortly after it was released on Christmas day, 1964, when I was 14 years old. It captivated me then in a way I have never forgotten; it still does.For this viewer, this is quite simply the greatest musical ever made. Perhaps Rogers & Hammerstein produced a greater number of high quality musicals than Lerner & Lowe, but this product of genius enjoys pride of place as the all time best.Call me an insufferable stick-in-the-mud, but I generally do not seek out pure entertainment. I love fine story telling in print or on film as much as anyone else, but I generally look for some edifying content, something that reaches into the human experience emotionally or intellectually. This motion picture is unique among all I have seen in my lifetime where the pure entertainment value is so high, it requires no other qualities to make it completely worthwhile -- to see not just once, but many times.This impeccable entertainment quality comes from the absolutely ingenious music and lyrics throughout, and the incomparable artistry of the sets and costumes. This movie is a flawless balance of true-to-life characterizations and Cinderella-like fantasy. Every part of this production adds to the effect of enchantment.Rex Harrison was born for this role, and Marni Nixon's singing voice, supplied for Audrey Hepburn, is out of this world.  Less well known is Bill Shirley, who supplied the singing voice for the one song of Freddy Eynsford Hill (Jeremy Brett).  Others, including Andy Williams, have recorded ""On the Street Where You Live"" over the years, but the pace, power, and clarity of Bill Shirley's singing is unequalled.My Fair Lady is an unsurpassed visual and aural showpiece, show-biz at its best, making good use of the timeless Pygmalion theme, and like other movies using this theme, doing it better than George Bernard Shaw; it is in the movies where one sees this theme treated with romance.Come to think of it, how can I contend such beauty and artistry is not edifying? I really can't, can I?",N/A

Most everyone who is into anime has already seen this series but for those of you who are not but may have seen and like movies like Princess Mononoke this is the series to pick up. It is by far the most accessible of any anime series I have seen and is perfect for a budding anime guru. In fact this is the very series I will show to my friends who have yet to see any anime they think is worth watching.Visually, Escaflowne is pretty remarkable for a TV series that shows obvious signs of extremely high production values. The story may not be the most intricate in the world of anime but it more than suffices. What is most impressive about Escaflowne is the characters. Van and Hitomi are some of my favorite characters ever and are both completely believable in their respective places; Hitomi as the fish out of water teenager and Van as the young kind thirsting for revenge. I also enjoyed many of the supporting characters such as Dilandu and Folken; even the bad guys were given a proper history and motivations rather than simple blind obedience to whatever evil scheme might be in style. In fact evil itself is somewhat grayed as no character is truly evil, only misguided doing what they believe is right and just.I would recommend Escaflowne to anyone and everyone; it is a series that can have appeal to the very young and old alike. Truly masterful work.Note that anyone who has seen this series on Fox Kids has been watching a kiddied down version of a show that wasn't really meant for children to begin with.

807959,"I missed seeing The Last Samurai in the theatre but decided to buy a copy anyway because it looked good in the ads and the write-ups I'd read.Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren, former Indian fighter in the U.S. Army (bits of this are shown in flashbacks)now a pathetic drunken loser reduced to giving sales demonstrations of Winchester rifles.He's contacted by a former associate and takes on the job of instructing the newly formed Japanese Imperial Army. The story is set in 1876 or so at a time of great change in Japan, the forces of modernization fast pacing Japan into the modern age. Part of this mission involves rooting out the last Samurai holdouts. Algren leads his recruits into battle, his recruits are massacred and after a valiant fight he is captured by the very man he is supposed to deal with. Taken to the Samurai village as a prisoner Algren gradually learns their ways, even learns to respect them. Algren eventually, after failing to reintegrate with his own people (and the dishonorable Japanese modernizers who I wanted to see get killed),joins with the Samurai in a battle to the death with the new Imperial Army. This is of course a slaughter with swords & spears against rifles & Gatling guns. The Imperial soldiers are so shamed by what they've done that they refuse an order to kill Algren and the Emperor strips the chief ""New Japan"" leader of everything he has.You never really learn what happens to Algren, it seems he goes back to the stronghold and the lead Samurai's widow, but that is presented as maybe he did, who knows?I thought the story was interesting, Cruise did a good job, but something was lacking- I'm not sure what. The costumes/ weapons were great, most of the sets/ locations were too ( a real sense of being in Japan)I just needed something more. Some of the extras are very interesting, I liked learning about how things were built or designed. The section about the film's Premiere in Japan was alright with the Japanese cast giving their thought's about the show although I thought the "" I like Tom Cruise"" stuff was a little to strong,the History Channel mini-documentary was too Cruise-ey for my taste as well.",N/A
836706,"Sometimes less is more -- and sometimes less is everything. Kim Ki-Duk works magic with only a few props in the ethereal, exquisite ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring,"" a movie that transcends its own simplicity. Beautiful, well-acted and quietly poetic, this Korean film is a movie to remember.Somewhere in a secluded spot, surrounded by tall mountains, is a beautiful little lake, and a small Buddhist monastery floats in the middle of it. Two monks live in it -- an elderly man (Oh Young-su), and a very young boy. The boy is full of the usual hijinks and mischief, but the old monk teaches him lessons that shape him as he grows to manhood.The young boy (Kim Young-min) learns that his childish cruelty has terrible consequences, and that if he kills anything, he will carry that ""stone"" with him for the rest of his life. Then, as he reaches adolescence, a young girl (Ha Yeo-jin) enters their lives -- and his heart. Filled with lust and love, the boy leaves for the outside world. But the world -- and a murder -- drives him back to where he started, to find death or redemption...""Spring"" is steeped in Buddhist teachings, but in a sense those teachings are truly universal -- all the more obvious because Kim is not a Buddhist, but a Catholic. The love of life, dangers of desire, mistakes and the danger of repeating them, and the cycles of death and birth are at the core of ""Spring,"" and it's impossible not to be touched by those ideas being woven into a simple, straightforward plot.The seasons parallel that of the younger monk's life, taking him from childhood to old age. It's a simple idea, but a good one. Director Kim Ki-duk (who has a starring role) gives an almost unearthly feel to the beautiful landscape, the dramatic scene on the snowy mountains, and especially to the beautiful little two-person monastery in the middle of a lake. The sight of it is almost unreal.Oh Young-su does an excellent job with the old monk, who has the wisdom the younger man sorely lacks. His past is a mystery; the problems his disciple encounters make you wonder what caused him to stay in seclusion. Kim himself plays the mature younger man, giving a startlingly nuanced performance as the character tries to atone for his sins, and takes the place where he is most needed.With a single set and only a few actors, Kim Ki-Duk crafts a meditative masterpiece in ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring."" Quiet, heartbreaking, beautiful and deceptively simple, this film is a must-see.",N/A

The Prisoner of Azkaban was a good movie but it was very different from the book. They had many alterations which included not haviing enough Quidditch, Harry not getting his books and the scene when they rescued Sirius lasted literally for 20 seconds. I was also dissapointed with the ending, I mean it stops when Harry gets the Firebolt and even that is a mistake because in the movie fred and george open it but in the book ron, Hermione and harry open it and then hermione takes it off Harry. I do have to say i miss the old director Chris Columbus who put everything from the books in. I mean what is the use of making the movie if you are not going to finish it right? If you are looking for a good night out go see the movie but if you want an adventure read the book. Great acting performances by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Emma Watson (Hermione).

This war is not only fought on land as what separates England and Europe is the English Channel.  There is also wealth and other items that can be retrieved from different continents around the world that could help each nation in the war.  In the middle of the war the HMS Surprise, a British frigate, whose captain, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), has been ordered to seek and destroy the French ship Acheron.  The story surrounds the quest of seeking to destroy this French vessel, which becomes a great adventure where Weir involves the audience by displaying all the different layers of  crew members on the HMS Surprise.  Nonetheless, the story focuses on two characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and the ship surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).Jack Aubrey is a resolute, yet understanding man who has served on the HMS Surprise ever since he was a early teenager.  Through years of experience Jack has learned to rely on his resourceful mind instead of taught naval strategy, which has kept the HMS Surprise afloat for many years.  Dr. Stephen Maturin is a freethinking scientist that has an infinite curiosity to learn new information or to make new discoveries.  These two men, also friends, contrast each other as they have different notions, which conflict with their interests.  There is one scene where Dr. Maturin studies the life and the complexity of life as the audience can hear Captain Aubrey's voice echoing in the background while laughing and chatting about memories of war.  This scene manage to display an analogy as it suggests the difficulty through which life is accomplished, and simultaneously, how easy one could destroy life.  This analogy serves is great example of how these two men complement each other and create an harmonious atmosphere on board a ship in war time.Master and Commander is an engaging film on many levels as Peter Weir presents the composition of the crew through several sub plots that involve several different themes in a male dominated environment.  These themes provide much food for thought as they open many new doors.  The complexity to Weir's seafaring tale is of great depth as it portrays both a swashbuckling adventure and a philosophical dialogue, which any audience will enjoy on either a visual or cerebral level.  Lastly, the cast performs superbly and is supported by marvelous cinematography, which is blended with masterful directing.  This leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that has several lessons, which can be both interesting and educational for many generations.",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
305584,"I'm one of those for whom a second tier Fred Astaire film is still more enjoyable than just about anything without him.  And there is no question that Fred is at his best in this one.  Unfortunately, he just isn't given first-rate musical material around which to wrap his massive dancing abilities.  His partner is the extraordinarily capable Rita Hayworth, who spent her teenage years as her father's dance partner in the years when she was both abused by him and when she looked completely Hispanic (plastic surgery, skin lightening, and dying her hair transformed Rita Cansino into Rita Hayworth).  They really do make a nice couple, though Fred had the rare ability to make almost anyone look like they were born to dance with him.The plot is fairly silly, but anyone who loves thirties and forties movies knows when to cut a film a bit of slack.  The cast is not outstanding beyond Fred and Rita, with the notable exception of Robert Benchley.  This was actually a crucial point in Benchley's career.  He had throughout the thirties maintained a dual movie career as the star of a string of hysterically funny one reelers, in which Benchley instructed the public on &quot;How to&quot; do things, such as &quot;How to Vote&quot; or &quot;How to Read.&quot;  He actually made one of the first talking shorts still to be seen occasionally, &quot;The Sex Life of a Polyp&quot; (1928, a short that obviously couldn't have been made after 1934 and the imposition of the Code).  Benchley also made a host of appearances in rather unimportant films during the decade.  Starting with Hitchcock's FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, however, Benchley began appearing in much higher quality films, including such gems as THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR (in which he plays Ginger Rogers's nemesis) and I MARRIED A WITCH.  Unfortunately, he died in 1945.The film was also extremely crucial for the career of Fred Astaire.  He had ended his mythic partnership with Ginger Rogers only two years earlier, and his two following films were both disappointments.  SECOND CHORUS was probably the worst film in Astaire's career, and BROADWAY MELODY OF 1940, while containing many wonderful moments, teamed him with legendary tap dancer Eleanor Powell.  Emending my statement above, these two did not mesh as dance partners.  Powell was too individual a performer, and excelled as a solo dancer, not as part of a team.  They also failed to generate any romantic chemistry.  YOU'LL NEVER GET RICH, while not a massive success, nonetheless reestablished him as a romantic dance star, and made six more films before his &quot;retirement&quot; in 1946 (he broke it as a favor to Gene Kelly in 1948 when Kelly broke his leg and was unable to film EASTER PARADE--the film &quot;unretired&quot; Astaire and he went on to make ten more musicals before retiring as a dancer).So, this won't be the greatest musical anyone has ever seen, but it certainly won't be the worst.  No Astaire fan would dare to miss it.",You'll Never Get Rich VHS
834101,"Finally, Paramount is releasing Star Trek: The Original Series by seasons, rather than in expensive two-episode packs.There are very few TV shows or movies that are so well known that a brief synopsis may be redundant, and Star Trek is one of those shows. Regardless, please bear with a brief synopsis because of the historical significance of the series. Star Trek not only launched a TV franchise with movies and series spinoffs that are still on the air, it had a direct and lasting impact on popular culture here and around the world.When creator Gene Roddenberry (The Great Bird of the Galaxy) somehow managed to get his show on the air in 1966, there was nothing else like it on TV. Its fresh and optimistic portrayal of the future with different races, even species, working side-by-side as equals was nothing short of revolutionary.In those days, not only was an integrated TV cast virtually unknown, women were also seldom depicted as anything but window dressing. Star Trek changed that, and so much more.The above preface was written for those who did not live through those times, and for those who would criticize Star Trek for cheesy special effects and acting. To me, the actual truth is this: Star Trek was both a product of its generation and a show that transcended its time. To look at it solely with the jaundiced eye of 2004 is to do it a great injustice. It was fun, bright entertainment, but it was MORE. It had to be, or it would not have lasted all of these decades or developed the most incredible fanbase in TV history.The story of Capt. James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Lt. Commander Montgomery Scott(James Doohan), Lts. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) and Sulu (George Takei), Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barret aka Mrs. Gene Roddenberry) only completed three seasons of missions ---- the shortest run of any of the franchise shows.The premise was simple, the above-mentioned crew of the Starship Enterprise was to explore new worlds, new civilizations, for five years. It was NOT a military mission, but many things occurred that brought the crew into conflict with other species. The stories were well written and included humor with the other dramatic and futuristic, space-related elements.Roddenberry sold it to the network as a ""Wagon Train to the Stars,"" but actually used the show to examine current events and cultural traditions of American society during a very turbulent time.The first season is great fun to watch, as the actors begin to feel more comfortable in their roles, especially Nimoy, whose Vulcan Science Office becomes richer as the series progresses.Here are the first-season episodes, listed in chronological order rather than broadcast order:The Corbomite Maneuver (11/10/1966)Mudd's Women (10/13/1966)The Enemy Within (10/6/1966)The Man Trap (9/8/1966)The Naked Time (9/29/1966)Charlie X (9/15/1966)Balance of Terror (12/15/1966)What Are Little Girls Made Of?

If so, they were The Cage (later remade into the two-part Menagerie); and Where No Man Has Gone Before.If you've never seen these shows uncut, or if you haven't given yourself a chance to view them without the burden of the 21st Century, you owe it to ourself to buy this set.",N/A

Finally watching Piccollo take on Frieza is simply amazing. Anyway, these four episodes have plenty of action and are a must buy. The actual DVD has no real extra's or anything, but you should be used to that if you buy Dragon Ball Z DVD's often. These are episodes not to be missed. Make sure you don't.",N/A
165133,"Stanley Kubrick's satire of the cold-war gone berserk was being made at about the same time (1964) as the &quot;serious&quot; treatment of the same theme by the movie &quot;Fail Safe&quot; starring Henry Fonda (also very good).Shot in black-and-white, frequently in wide-angle for extended periods of time, there are many unforgettable images - probably the most-remembered of which is Major Kong (played by normally-a-cowboy actor Slim Pickens) riding the dropping bomb - &quot;Yee-haw...yee-hawwww!&quot;.Although much has been made of Peter Sellers' 3 roles (which would have been four (as Major Kong) if not for breaking his ankle), I think Geroge C. Scott should have gotten an oscar for his performance. His &quot;itemization&quot; scene in the war-room was a thing of beauty - the single best part is when he gets to &quot;five...&quot;. Later, he also accidently (as rumor has it) falls down and somersaults to his feet, still delivering his line - and Kubrick decided to use it.Sterling Hayden (normally a cowboy actor) also could have gotten an oscar for his performance as Jack D. Ripper, the Burpleson air force base commander who sends the planes against Russia. The scene when he tells Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) about his plan is probably the best single scene overall in the movie, except for...Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove at the end. He plays his German scientist role way way over the top. (&quot;Animals could be bred und slaughtered!&quot;). I won't spoil it further, however. Balances nicely with his portrayal of Group Captain Mandrake on loan from the RAF (&quot;Shoot, with the gun! That's what the bullets are for, you twit!&quot;), and his rather meek president Mertin Muffley (&quot;Get me Premiere Kissoff!&quot;).James Earl Jones and Keenan Wynn have minor roles.The one funky thing is the obvious fake flying bomber shots - a static model with rear-projection - but it is almost surely intentionally hokey. There are one or two other instances of this, such as the Coke spraying from the soda machine into &quot;Bat&quot; Guano's eye.Even the style of the credits was unusual. Opening song &quot;Try A Little Tenderness&quot; over scenes of mid-air refueling airplanes, and closing song of &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; over scenes of....ha! you must see it.Fantastic movie with good extras.","Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"

You can't help by liking the film, even though it was made in the weird 1980's.Anyway the film follows Taimak (where has he been, anyway?) as kung-fu master Leroy Green, who has reached the highest level of martial arts. He is trying to find the master in himself but is confronted by Sho'nuff, the baddest guy from Harlem. Leroy is also romances a DJ named Laura Charles, played by Vanity  (where has she been too?; have you noticed that one-named actors are often lost in oblivion in the movie industry?)Even though the film has a horrible 80's era feel to it, the film nevertheless boasts good karate action, a dated but fun soundtrack, and memorable lines by Sho'nuff (""who's the baddest?

886040,"Yes, this is a movie about SEX. Heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, bestiality, pedophilia and other forms of sexual activities perfumed by the Human animal and the scientist (Dr. Kinsey) that studied them and his life are at the core of this film. The film also tries to answer the question of love and its relationship to sex and the consequences of sex. Yup, it's all about sex, folks!At a time when ""morality"" and ""sex"" are pretty high in the collective American psyche, this film can be safely deemed the timeliest film of the year. It will provoke a lot of uneasy questions in the minds of millions of people (especially in those Red States), which won't be that different from the affect Dr. Kinsey's book had back in the 40's.Let's face it; sex is never an easy subject. It's an intimate, very personal issue that most people are reluctant to tackle openly. Dr. Kinsey's argument, thus the movie's, is that it's very natural for a single human being to experience different sexual desires. Whether or not it is ""legal"" to act on those desires is another issue.The film is very bold and honest in its portrayal of Dr. Kinsey's life and research. Expect to see still images of productive organs copulating (I wonder how that'll go in the Red States!) The acting is superb, the soundtrack is pretty and the cinematography is amazing. All in all, a unique, very rewarding moviegoing experience. Highly recommended!",N/A
567329,"I was disturbed by some of the comments regarding this film. Let's start at the beginning. I heard a rumour at the time that Wakeman had re-joined YES and were preparing new material along the lines of Topographic Oceans. My friend then played me a new 2-CD set he bought called Keys To Ascension (KTA). I noted that it had Wakeman, and that there were a number of live tracks and a few new studio tracks. I was stunned by the fantastic production of the live tracks, and also had heard a few snips of the new material on the net, but there were several songs missing.Meanwhile I attended an exhibition where I purchased a 2nd generation VHS copy of a laser-disc ""KTA Live"". This turned out to be the live material from the CD, presented in full. I was stunned at the performances, they were near-perfect. So perfect I suspected that the musicians had possibly over-dubbed some parts. Still, having seen Yes many times beginning with 1979's triumphant 10th anniversary (Tormato) tour, I knew they could sound so good. I can also say I've played guitar for 35 years, and studied Howe's work. I re-watched and I still cannot tell if it's live all the way through, but it does seem to be live more than not. Perhaps they just did such a great job of recording the music that it lent itself to being nicely mixed. I will say that if it's true that they mixed in shots from other concerts for variety, I have no problem with that and it makes perfect sense then why I may have thought they were over-dubbing. This would at least mean the excellent performances are intact.A little later saw the release of ""Keystudio"", which I purchased immediately, and turned out to be all of the studio cuts recorded with Wakeman but not released together, only mixed up over KTA 1 or 2. Now Keystudio is a great post-classic Yes album, their best since Going For The One. There are songs like Mind Drive, over 20 minutes, and while it's not Close To The Edge, it's definetly in the tradition of the longer classic Yes tunes, and has excellent solos by Howe and Wakeman sprinkled liberally. Do yourself a favour, if you enjoyed classic Yes but are lukewarm to their newer incarnations, pick up Keystudio.Now someone said Alan White is the premier drummer...etc. Let's remember one thing: The drummer on ALL the classic Yes albums up to Close To The Edge was Bill Bruford. He was an essential part of the early Yes sound. Alan White's first album with Yes (not counting Yessongs) was the challenging Tales From Topographic Oceans. Alan White came from playing with guys like John Lennon (Plastic Ono) and his style is good, technical, but the sound is rock, wheras Bruford was jazz and fusion, with that trademark rimshot. Also, Bruford's style was such that the producer Eddy Offord could get a really tight mix. White is a more physical player, so lots of reverb and ambience started to colour Yes's sound in later albums. I think White's greatest acheivment with Yes was Relayer, especially Sound Chaser (wicked track). They never play any Relayer now, mainly cause Patrick Moraz was a fluke in that band. You wouldn't get Wakeman trying to emulate PM keys, wheras PM playing Wakeman is acceptable...Therefore any classic Yes with Bruford we hear with White drumming will always (to my ears) fall short of the Bruford originals. Bluntly: Alan White is no Bruford. Bruford is one of the best ever. However White has been the drummer for so long he IS the YES drummer, ABWH aside.So, the DVD version of this, unless they changed it from the version I saw, is bound to be excellent, tight, with great solos by Wakeman and Howe, solos that are new, not the same as the albums (I always liked this about live Yes), and in some parts so good you cannot tell the difference from the originals. They really went to a lot of effort to represent their older material. These concerts were held to honour some classic music, and I am happy to have this because it is the only visual record I have of this band performing live. I do have the Live In Philadelphia 1979, which was recorded on the same tour I saw, but the sound quality is disappointing. I am glad I got to see the same line up last year in Toronto. They amazed me by playing Revealing Science of God, and thanked the audience for making it possible for them to still be able to perform their longer cuts. They were excellent that night, and played ""South Side Of The Sky"" which I'd never seen them perform in the 25 years since 1979.The concert: There's nothing wrong with the visuals, there was a lot of imagery in their music. The images are used sparingly and in my opinion are not too distracting. Yes, all live concerts suffer from the filmakers not knowing who is soloing. Just look at the ""Goodbye Cream"" farewell concert, most of the footage is extreme close-ups of Jack Bruce's facial boils. Hey he's the singer....who cares about that skinny guy with the guitar - Eric Claptrap, Clipboard? whatever. But it's not that bad in Keys To Ascention. Worth the cheap orice it seems to be selling for, so I guess I'll have to upgrade my VHS copy.",N/A

817875,"Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a sleezeball cassanova who sleeps with a different woman every day and makes up excuses to never see them again. This is usually very easy for him, since he lives in Hawaii and has encounters with tourists who will quickly be flying away, never to bug him again. He is a veterinarian at an aquarium theme park, where his specialty is working with large sea mammals. He has a better rapport with the animals than with other people.One day, everything changes. He finds himself at an out-of-the-way waffle house where he first spots Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). He is instantly smitten and quickly makes conversation with her. They arrange to see each other the next morning. He shows up and resumes their conversation, only to see her get &quot;weirded out&quot; and wondering why he is behaving the way he is.  The waitress explains Lucy's problem to Henry. After a head injury received in a car wreck, she cannot save short term memories into long-term memories... her slate is wiped clean each night when she sleeps.The film's trailers fail to show the crude sexual humor peppered through out the film and only highlight the sweet sappy flavor of this seemingly doomed romance.  When the film was being conceived, they writers no doubt had a lot of laughs and threw in gags and jokes here and there, but didn't have the wisdom to leave some of them on the cutting room floor. First the film is a comedy, then a disgusting sexual parody, then a tragedy, then a sappy romance flick, then a &quot;happily ever after&quot; film - but it does not do well in all these roles.Sean Astin portrays Doug, Lucy's steroid-abusing brother with a bad lisp and not much between the ears. This character simply was not necessary, and if snipped, could have spared the viewer 10-15 minutes of mental drivel.Then there's Henry's aquarium assistant, Alexa (Lusia Strus), who by virtue of being plain and flat-chested has been made out as an androgenous bisexual who is the butt of jokes, including being sprayed on by walrus vomit.  It's as though this woman has no feelings, just happy and randy at all times, even though she is treated like garbage. This character could have also been eliminated, spared the viewer another 10 minutes of eye-rolling, and made the romance and drama portion of the movie that much more enjoyable.Lucy's brain injury is no laughing matter and at times, the movie addresses this, as she goes through the mental trauma of daily reliving the fact that each day is another lie, as when she wakes up each morning, she has no idea that a year has gone by.  To make Lucy feel better, Dr. Keats (Dan Akroyd) introduces Lucy to &quot;Ten Second Tom&quot; who lost a portion of his brain during a hunting accident, so he can only remember things for 10 seconds. This is incredibly tragic, yet made as a comic relief gag.Ula (Rob Schneider) is Henry's best friend and coworker at the aquarium. While also an improbable character, is a hilarious character and a fun side-kick for comic relief... although he can be quite crude as well.As with every character that Adam Sandler has ever played on the big screen, his character is a pathetic lonely man whose heart is forever changed by one magical moment and a special warm-hearted woman who gives him focus and purpose in life... and then after some drama, they live happily ever after. It's a good formula, but a good 30 minutes could have been snipped from the film and it would have been much better in the long run.The content is so highly valued by the filmmakers, however, that everyone at the screening I attended was searched for any recording devices... another indication that they took every portion of the film so seriously, they weren't able to stand back and with some tough love, edit out the less savory portions and make it a more palatable film.In the end, the film evokes real tears and some real belly laughs, but like a rollercoaster ride after eating a monster chili dog, sometimes the thrills aren't worth pain.  Fun to watch, but I never have to see it again.",N/A
440759,"""The Atomic Bomb Movie"" is the most impressive, visually stunning and well-assembled film ever made on the history of the nuclear bomb and the various tests that followed after the end of World War 2. It is a documentary made with real passion for the subject, the information and visual records. This is obviously Peter Kuran's baby (listen to the commentary track where he speaks about the awakening of his interest in nuclear testing and the eventual production of this film with the awe and wonder of discovery), every aspect of his dedication to the project is evident in how much information he gives us, the detail in the assembly and most of all, in the painstaking restoration of old military footage documentating numerous tests. Visually this is one of the most incredible films you will ever see. One can only watch in astonishment at the size and destruction and yet beauty we find in the shots of tests ranging from Bikini island to even outer space. For many a lot of what the movie shows will be shockingly new (for me the biggest surprise was indeed the information about nuclear bombs being detonated in space). Kuran takes inside of the effects of a nuclear blast, so much as to show us exactly what an attack scenario would be like if you were inside your home and a bomb was dropped. And all this is done with incredible clarity, a lot of the old footage has been lovingly polished to a gloss and rarely do any images look old or scratchy. All this is framed with William Stromberg's rich, epic score that marches and pulses with great gusto. ""The Atomic Bomb Movie"" is that special kind of documentary that is perfect for classroom exhibition but also an awesome experience for normal home viewing. Kuran has done a service by assembling this film because it is important to preserve this information for future generations. In his commentary Kuran stresses the importance of not letting people forget about the history of nuclear testing, so it doesn't repeat itself. Do not miss this film, it is important and unforgettable.",Trinity and Beyond! The Atomic Bomb Movie VHS
440456,"This Pearl Harbor movie still remains the best treatment of the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. What really works with this film was that both sides are accurately, fairly and without much bias, portrayed by the filmmakers. The internal struggles within the Japanese leadership as well as complacency of the Americans were clearly shown.This movie remains totally superior to that overblown mess of the movie that came out several years ago called ""Pearl Harbor"", probably one of the worst movies ever made so far in this century.It bit ironic but I thought that the Japanese scenes were done better then the American scenes. Japanese scenes seem to have more drama, better script and better direction. American scenes seem to be bit flat in many areas. The special effects for the movie still haven't aged that much. Its still as impressive as I first saw it back in the 1970s.As for the DVD, its cheap, the anamorphic transfer proves to be quite excellent, wide screem format really helped this movie and its unthinkable to watch it in ""TV format"". What a waste that would be. The DVD don't have much extra outside of a short 20 minute documentary but I enjoyed the commentary by Richard Fleischer and Stuart Galbraith. The sound is in DD 4.1 and it seem to be pretty clear and strong to my humble speaker system.Overall, a very good movie, well acted, well directed and above all, a very fair approach to the subject.",N/A

596273,"Sci-Fi thrillers are always good to watch. Speilberg gives us a real treat and this is certainly one of Speilberg's darkest films to date. Minority Report has more in common with Schindler's List and Blade Runner than it does with Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Jurassic Park. This is new ground for Spielberg and having bombed with A.I. it is certainly a better direction for him to move in.Tom Cruise is at the helm of this futuristic crime busting lab that is able to predict serious felonies before they happen by way of three psychics that are hooked into the system. His display of manipulating their imagination and dreams among a big glass digital screen is almost done with the same wizardry that Speilberg edits his own films. Speilberg's thoughts are on form in Minority Report and most of the movie is big and wild in a vast dreamscape. Speilberg does not leave it at that though. He manages to actually hunk in a tense action thriller full of suspense about a man on the run from his own system. It is also full of brains and creative imagery. Who can forget Cruise chasing his own eyes as they roll down the hall? ""What!"" you say? Yes, Speilberg has gone a bit loco here and it pays off in aces.Who can also forget the performance of Colin Farrell who actually manages to convincingly try to outperform Cruise on the screen, even though this is one of his first mainstream films. This flick is as much Farrell's as it Cruise's and boy does he make sure of that.I will not spoil the plot but it has something to do with Cruise predicting his own felony which involves a homicide of man who may have kidnapped and murdered his son. Speilberg cues lots of actions, sci-fi extraordinaires, genuine detective work and throws in a who dunnit' to cap it all off. Make no mistake about it. Minority Report is a fast fury of unstoppable set pieces to boot.Unfortunately Speilberg does not deliver on the last fifth of the film. Here he goes for double-jeopardy when maybe he should have just stayed put. The extra fifteen minutes tries to turn the chase on the bad guys instead and unfortunately never lives up to what the first 2 hours of magic gave us. In fact it is cheesy and out of kilter with the rest of the film. It feels a bit contrived and certainly is devoid of the suspense that we witnessed throughout this great sci-fi fest. What does it end up doing? You come away feeling that you should have left fifteen minutes ago. It was such a shame to have been on the edge of your seat for most of it only now to be sitting there gawking at your watch and wondering if you are looking at a reel from another movie that projectionist tagged on by accident.When all is said and done the movie is inescapable enchantment but is marred by a terrible ending whatever way you look at it and it does lower the quality of this fine film considerably.",N/A
808034,"As soon as I could digest the fact that this movie advertised Tom Cruise as a Samurai I became excited by what appeared to be an epic saga about Japans tumultuous transition from millenia old traditionalism, into the modern era.  I figured, at the least, Samurai are interesting to watch; right?  Plus Edward Zwick (the Director) was the dude who also directed Glory...Gobs of money were spent on the finest talent, set design, musical production, and effects........and it all shows.  This movie is beautiful to look at and interesting to watch.  Too bad it has about as much meaning as a plate of dog barf.Those looking for the substance of Glory (or a South Park episode for that matter) are in for grave disapointment. But before you get all worked up and angry about that, consider the movies basic premise:War weary mercenary enlists his services to the Japanese Imperial Army (not as some of the reviews contend ""to crush the Samurai"", but rather to modernize the military and keep it competitive with the rest of the world).  A rogue Samurai (Katsumoto) takes up arms against the evil Imperial Army (headed by the Emperor) to defend the ""way of the Samurai"" and the ancient (inarguably beautiful) way of life they preserve.Ok, a little wobbly, but it gets way more conflicted.  Almost as if they started making the movie before they took the basic philosophical premise to its logical end...Following below are some of the conflicts that made this movie a ""hero agnostic"", conflicted, collage of plot-slop.The Samurai, as cool as they were, were dead meat.  They used swords!  Sure, they used them well, very well (and some arrows too), but one word ""machine gun"" (ok, two).  Hello?!!  The whole purpose of a Samurai is to defend their masters (typically the ruling class).  With the advent of modern weaponry, their refusal to change with the times negated their worth to ""useless"".  Many of them stepped aside, this story is about one moron who didn't (Katsumoto), and instead caused the death of just about every innocent, selfless, loving person under his guardianship.Ok, it'd be one thing if ""the enemy"" was real, but the enemy was led by the Emperor, his sworn master.  Sure, the Emperor was being influenced by greedy counsel, but in the movie, at every juncture of opportunity, Katsumoto acted like some hot-headed blood thirsty baby.  Even when the Emperor granted him special audience to to plead his case, he TOTALLY deferred to the Emperors judgment.Well, the Emperor needed to modernize Japan.  The Samurai were finished.  But I guess that wouldn't sell tickets, so we had to watch Katsumoto lead all those that were sworn to him into a completely futile attempt to fight the machine gun toting opposition.  Kinda cool I guess.  That is, if you're not the kind to be bothered by the fact that this kind of mindless leadership (and more importantly mindless obedience) is the cause of most all of mankinds war and resultant gore, broken bodies, broken civilizations, and broken families.Hey, I love war movies (Empire of the Sun stands as one of my favorites), and I don't need a ""pure hero"" to root for.  But this movie actually had me rooting for ""the dark side"", at least their position made some sense.",N/A
422617,"My theater class and I saw this after I finished reading the play TWELFTH NIGHT, and I must say, it kept to the script really well. But the depth that it had was great- when I read the play, it was kind of like 'Hmmm... okay, this is cool, love triangles!' And then it skipped to the servant scenes and I started racing through those to get to the, I supposed, 'better' action taking place with the twins.But the servants have some of the best character representation out of the movie, especially Ben Kingsley as Feste and Malvolio- they rocked. And the main cast was perfect, as well.All in all, probably the best re-doing of a Shakespeare play that I have ever seen... I loved it!Oh- and how can anybody help but love the music to this movie? Kingsley's voice is magnificent, and makes you finish the thing wanting more. (My theater teacher is a performer at heart, and after our class finished it, he memorized the closing song- The Wind and the Rain- and that's practically all he sings nowadays... and what's worse, he has our English teacher doing it, too. :)But watch this, seriously.

593,"As with almost everyone, I was stunned. I know the Stations of the Cross as well as anyone who grew up Catholic, and I know the Gospels as well any Baptist. However, like Chicago Sun-Times movie critic Roger Ebert, I was connected with the reality of the suffering Christ went through in a very real way. It is just a movie, and the guy on the cross wasn't Jesus. But it caused me to think about Jesus in a whole new way.I knew this was coming. I have read dozens of articles on this and tuned into every show on the movie. Not good enough. It still hit me. It wasn't the blood that spattered on my face, but the love that spattered on my heart. I sat in that theater as a Christian who believes, but I experienced something very heavy that evening. There is no separating my Christian beliefs from my reaction to the movie.The subtitles take nothing from the experience, and add to the focus on the movie's story rather its dialogue.The beginning sets the dramatic tone, delivering us into the Garden of Gesthemene as Jesus prays. Judas kisses him softly on the cheek, and a fight ensues between the posse of soldiers and Jesus' disciples. Jesus himself waits, and even heals the ear wounded by Peter, whom Jesus rebukes. The following events include a trial and flogging. Jesus never raises a hand or comment against his accusers, nor does he deny their accusations that he claims to be God. Pilate is torn politically, wanting to do the right thing and wanting to save his own position. Unwilling to assert a position, he lays the call onto the town's citizen who are in a blood-frenzy.What grabbed me in the movie were unexpected scenes, like Jesus and Mary connecting sight on the Via Dolorosa. Jesus stumbles, and the movie flashes back to Mary running to a four year old Jesus who stumbled in a field. She picks him up, holds him motherly. Now, Jesus is 33, all battered and worn from a vicious, sadistic abuse by Roman soldiers. Mary runs to him. He speaks to her, whispering cryptically, ""See mother, I make all things new,"" and does his best to press on. It is his cross to carry, and he raises to his feet.The ending is ingeniously subtle. In some ways, they are the 30 most important seconds of the movie in which it all comes together. Every drop of blood, every rejected silver piece, and every cross-dragged furrow in the road to Golgotha comes together in probably the most understated yet complete climax to a movie I have ever seen.I understand now why people bought tickets for friends, dragged people to see it. I expected to be blown away, but I didn't expect to be hit at my core on so many different levels.The movie isn't perfect. Some scenes took more poetic license than can be historically supported. Herod was decadently different than I expected, and perhaps the least like the real Herod. Herod's lascivious persona here matches the essence, if not the exact personality. His reactions to the Christ situation were consistent with the Bible, and add texture to Pilate's dilemma.Some vague scenes confused me, like when Satan carries a grimacing, sneering man-child. However, as Satan's gender is not important to his evil nature, the androgyny holds up.A knowledge of Christian scripture will augment an understanding of the film's secondary flashback scenes. The movie does stand on its own, and meets the vision of its controversial director. Whether the audience is a devout believer, or seeing the movie as an artistic portrayal of history's most influential figure, the movie will work. I expect it to be rerun in theaters every Easter season.I fully recommend this movie.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",N/A

573816,"In the ancient days of the early '80s, many Conan-imitation fantasies stalked the land. Most of them were cheap, dreary, and unwatchable. But the best of this low-budget bunch was the successful 1982 flick, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer."" Director Albert Pyun has gone onto to direct a slew of very cheesy movies, often featuring kickboxing, but this is his best film. People who love brawny sword-swingin' action will get a kick out of it. Yes, it's done cheaply, but there's some honest imagination in it, and the plot -- although filled with massive holes as deep as torture pits -- actually seems as if the writers took some time to think it up. The story still follows the basic clich&eacute;s of this type of fantasy -- saving princesses, a vengeance-seeking hero, a resurrected evil wizard -- but it flows well and keeps you interested.Of course,the film has tons of problems, and anyone who isn't seriously into the fantasy genre or early 80s movies will probably hate it. The sets are inexpensive and unimpressive, the photography cramps the action to stretch the budget, visual effects are minimal, and the acting is at best only adequate (but still better than most films of this kind). Lee Horsley plays the wise-cracking hero Talon, who wields a silly but rather cool three-bladed sword. Talon joins the resistance against evil King Cromwell (veteran b-movie villain Richard Lynch) in order to rescue a princess (Kathleen Beller). Behind it all lurks a monstrous sorcerer (Richard Moll under some well-done make-up) who has it in for Cromwell for betraying him and manipulates the resistance for his own ends. The story builds up to a surprisingly exciting finale that flexes some furious muscle and spills copious amounts of blood.Unlike fantasy movies made today, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is adult in tone: the violence gets quite bloody and extreme, and casual nudity is sprinkled throughout. The DVD from Anchor Bay is an adequate presentation. The picture is letterboxed and enhanced for widescreen TVs. There is some grain, but the well-lit scenes look quite clear. The sound comes in 2.0 surround and 5.1. The 5.1 mostly expands the music to the back speakers, but it sound good considering the age and budget of the film.

872051,"I walked into My Architect: A Son's Journey expecting a solid documentary in a year of many wonderful documentary releases. Little did I realize that I would be receiving much, much more than that.My Architect is an amazingly compelling story of a son's journey to discover more about the father he never really knew. As the film progressed, and drew me more and more into its fascinating discoveries, it reminded me so much of a real life Citizen Kane - A portrait of a prominent figure head, painted as indestructible, but just as human and fallible as those he seems to tower above.Interview after interview, director Nathaniel Kahn peered into tearful eyes as the interviewee explained how Louis Kahn, his father, had touched their lives. Kahn was portrayed  not only as an great architect, but as a friend, father, rival, cuckold, and savior depending on who Nathaniel happened to be talking to at the moment.How could a man of such influence and integrity in the workplace be so careless with the family aspect of his life? How did he manage to juggle three secret lives? What would he have done had he not died of a sudden heart attack in a train station? Where was he going? My Architect meditates on these questions in such a beautiful and poignant way, it is impossible to not be moved by the discoveries.Not simply an exploration of family conflicts, My Architect is also a poetic study of art as a political medium, as a career, and most importantly as a deeply spiritual journey.",N/A

799040,"Critics, in general, maligned this movie - perhaps unfairly.  The trouble is, it had SO MUCH to live up to.  How could it fail to disappoint?It's true that this is my least favorite of the Matrix movies.  When I re-watched the film, I tried to ascertain the meaning of this.  I think it is because it gives us the least of what we enjoyed about The Matrix in the first place.  The Matrix succeeds in the unlikely task of making a sci-fi, kung fu action flick out of Cartesian philosophy.  The first movie was about ideas and it also had a completely unique look to it.  The second movie got bogged down a bit with its ideas and made them seem a bit like mumbo-jumbo.  However, the second film had terrific fight scenes and a great highway chase.The problem about The Matrix: Revolutions is that, not only is it not about ideas - we hardly spend any time in The Matrix.  The big set-piece in this movie is the fight between the Squids and the defenders of Zion.  I wasn't too interested in that.  For one thing, there were so many Squids, I couldn't believe that the humans wouldn't be overwhelmed or retreat immediately.After Trinity rescues Neo at the beginning, we don't go back to The Matrix until the end.  That means no kung fu fighting and - even worse - no Agent Smith!  Agent Smith is the most fun character in these movies and under using him here is a critical flaw.  The best part of the film is the final confrontation between Smith and Neo.The Matrix Revolutions is still a good movie and worth owning.  The Matrix phenomenon has taken on a life of its own and the three movies fit well together as a set.  However, unlike Star Wars, The Matrix starts out strong but progressively declines.",N/A
49247,"Willis, Stowe and Pitt turn in spectacular performances. All three and Gilliam as well, have already been deservedly praised. Like others, I was astonished by Brad Pitt's acting ability, which I had previously dismissed. Some reviewers asserted, however, that Pitt's performance was overdone. The interesting aspect to this accusation is that the film is highly stylized, and all of the other supporting actors are deliberately cartoonish - over-the-top by design. So are the supporting roles. If you single out Pitt for such criticism, you unwittingly reveal that you are close to believing him... even as he is playing a necessarily outrageous character that serves as antidote to an otherwise bleak dystopia.In college, I had a paranoid schizophrenic friend, and visited him a few times when he was institutionalized with others like him. Pitt must have studied these people. Not only does he have the right delusional intonations, he has the right quirky medicated movements too. He isn't just histrionically mad; he's _really_ mad. Overdone? I beg to differ! He's spot on.A number of reviewers have mentioned that the film should be viewed several times. More important in this context is that the film _can_ be viewed repeatedly with great enjoyment. Viewability is a rare quality in American cinema, and it is precisely the quality that makes 12 Monkeys a worthy addition to home video libraries.",N/A

601885,"In BriefWhen Canadian Air Force pilot Jack Ferriman (Harrington) recruits the salvage crew aboard the tugboat Arctic Warrior to investigate a mysterious vessel he has spotted adrift in a remote region of the Bering Sea, they discover the remains of the fabled Antonia Graza.  Thought lost at sea for more than 40 years, once onboard the eerie cavernous ship, the crew discover that the decaying vessel is anything but deserted.  It's home to something more deadly and horrific than anything they've encountered in all their years at sea.ReviewThere is something knowing in this films charm.  Yes its decidedly corny, but as it opens with 1940&#65533;s period credits, one can&#65533;t help but think its always giving you a sly nudge and wink throughout.  Unlike other horror films, this doesn&#65533;t rely on over the top MTV editing but rather classic jumps and scares, building a solid if what somewhat flawed 90 minutes of entertainment.Opening with one the most original mass killings that I can recall, it is hilariously disgusting throughout.  And while, the story slows briefly to introduce everyone, it picks up apace and has beautifully depicted montage to Mudvayne&#65533;s latest song. Captain Sean Murphy (Byrne) is a slat weathered old hand, and lends the story some weight while team leader Maureen Epps (Margulies) and First Mate Greer (Washington) engage with the basic script aplomb.Hidden within this film, is a twist that will have you kicking yourself, and while the haunted house concept of Ghost Ship has yet to produce a classic, its filled with moments that bring it close.  The premise may be unoriginal but Ghost Ship is still worth a look, if only for a chance to laugh at an ending that is as knowing as it is ridiculous.The VerdictGhost Ship provides a fun night out; its not necessarily going to scare you ridged, but how many films really do that in our desensitised days?  It is gruesome, making me laugh on plenty of occasions, and with the talent on display here you have to conclude that they knew what they were creating.  The Sun would call it, &#65533;A fun filled thrill ride,&#65533; I&#65533;d call it &#65533;A hilariously disgusting B movie,&#65533; either way check it out!",N/A
304905,"I love the remake, with Lindsay Lohan & Jamie Lee Curtis, which made me curious about the fact that there's a remake. With nothing else to do before Christmas apart from having DVD-buying withdrawal symptoms, I bought this, mainly because it wasn't on my wishlist, therefore, safe. And cheap too. I'm not that keen on Jodie Foster, and her hair in this was an absolute mess, plus, she had a (fake) mouthful of metal. Boy, do I remember that all too well. There weren't a lot of stars apart from her that I knew, although Barbara Harris looked very familiar.Apart from some very dodgy shots - mainly featured during the water-skiing scenes, where it was perfectly obvious the actors were against a blue screen, and it looked so fake - the movie was really good! Not a patch on the remake, but it still had its funny moments, and funny deadpan lines, coming mainly from Barbara Harris a lot of the time. Disney did a good job with this movie, and even managed to include some extras!It's a lot more faithful to the book as well, more so than the recent update, which was updated beyond belief to fit in to the 21st century. This did come across as rather OTT at times, and almost sickly sweet. The movie also owed a lot to the old slapstick of Laurel & Hardy movies, amongst others. And very bad 70s fashion & hair! It's also a lot more simplistic, but with both the original & the remake, little is featured of the love interest. And the bit where they swap minds is really corny (flashing green/blue colours over the bodies), but the bit where they actually swap BODIES is pure genius. There are a lot of Disney cliches thrown in, and your typical Disney chase scene, which doesn't hold a candle to the one from Ronin. The slapstick comes when a police car goes through a very narrow tunnel, and comes out shaped like a triangle or when they go along a patch of road, and the car splits in half! (Also watch out for the patch of storm drain, which was also featured in the car race in Grease!) The film also has interesting feminist implications and the heavily hinted-at subplot involving teen alcoholism is compellingly unexplained, and would have been funny.Jodie Foster doesn't really come across as a great child actor. For one thing, her voice can sometimes be very monotone, and she has a very 'old' voice too. (Now that sounds very weird.) The voice does not match what she looks like. Plus, in a few scenes, it's really clear how much difficulty she was having talking with her metal train tracks. She also doesn't have a lot to mess up/learn unlike her mother. The mother calls her husband ""daddy"", and plays a hot game of softball with a group of little boys. Jodie has less to work with - she screws up a typing class, a photography class, band practice AND field hockey, but does OK in social studies.There are only two extras, but you get your money's worth with an up-to-date interview with Jodie Foster - although I think she was talking before the 2003 remake. It's quite a long interview, and she doesn't just talk about Freaky Friday, she talks about a lot of her other Disney movies, and how she auditioned to be a young Princess Leia, but was contracted to do another Disney movie. The Memory Game is mind-numbingly slow, and isn't worth wasting your time on.All in all, this is a great movie, although some people will go too much into it, and think about all the complications, like how the mother is a smoker, but the daughter isn't - surely they'd experience cravings etc? The movie's meant to be enjoyed not analysed, and if you can get past the dodgy blue screen scenes, then you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself, and put a smile on your face.",N/A

617967,"Tarantino made a smart move when he decided to film a two-part martial arts movie. In the wake of the Matrix films and Lord of the Rings, he could cut his four-hour flick in half and release it 6 months apart. Ten years ago, he might not have been able to. By cutting it in half, he took a long, rambling movie and turned it into two tight movies. This DVD, the first part, moves fast. It's funny, violent, and full of memorable scenes and images.Another reason it's such a smart move: Tarantino is a movie geek, so he can throw in dozens of ""homages"" to his favorite kung fu movies in this movie. If you get the references (like Uma wearing Bruce Lee's yellow motorcycle outfit) that's great. If not, you don't miss out on anything essential.Tarantino is still mixing up the sequence of events, telling the story out of order, and it still works. The audience can follow along the first time, but the movie is better the second or third time, when you have a better idea of who's who and what's going on. In Pulp Fiction, the out-of-order sequence puts you off-balance. This time, he's so good at it, you can't imagine telling the story any other way.Tarantino challenged himself in Kill Bill to shoot great action sequences, and he succeeded. The fights are the high points. They are suspenseful, intercut with humor and dialogue, and too stylized to be taken seriously. The swordfight at the end is fantastic, even if you only pay attention to the lighting. (Which brings me to Robert Richardson, the cinematographer for Kill Bill. Best known for his work on Natural Born Killers and other Oliver Stone movies, he's the guy who puts the glowing light behind everyone. Overhead lights shimmer in the hair of actors, and windows bleed light around the edges. It's a nice effect.)You can't go wrong with this film. Although the DVD doesn't have a lot of extras, the movie itself is worth it. Tarantino has developed his directing and writing style, making it simpler without losing any of his trademarks: the Seinfeld-like conversations, the long takes, the camera-in-the-trunk point of view, sudden bursts of violence, and fake product placement. This is his fourth film and he hasn't peaked yet. He's four for four..",N/A

585,"After seeing The Passion of The Christ I walked away more of a believer and reflecting upon my own path in my life while saying, ""Look what WE did to him !""...Never did I believed or blamed the Jewish people or the Romans solely responsible for the death of Jesus. Nor did I walk away from the film hating  Jewish people. Utterly ridiculous. Also, those who know the teachings or the bible so well have forgotten that it was a prophecy that even Jesus knew he had to fulfill for humankind... We as a human race(regardless of creed or ethnicity), a collective people crucified him. Further more, I used to think of Jesus only as a divine and spiritual higher power; I had forgotten how human he was also. The Passion of the Christ reaffirmed this... Further more, for someone such as 60 Minutes' commentator Andy Rooney to say that he would never or not subject himself to watching such a violent or gory film while calling Gibson a wacko only shows the magnitude of ignorance he and others share about The Passion of the Christ and Mel Gibson !  Rooney should ask himself if Jesus was okey dokey with subjecting himself to a cruel and horrific death !...Wonder if Gisbon is saying at this point , ""Can't satisfy everyone !""...and that is not the point of this film and obviously his on the recreation of the last twelve hours of Jesus' life. If it is too brutal, too violent, too graphic, then those viewers need to get real ! There is nothing gratuitous,overboard or overblown. I have yet to hear anyone on the contrary say that they have found evidence or proof that the torture Jesus endured was a walk through the park. Also, I'm sure there is some jealousy and resentment amongst the powerful film studio moguls(including those who did not want to touch or back up Gibson's project) who only wished they would have had half the vision and [guts] Mel Gibson possessed in directing The Passion of the Christ! Hats off to Gibson and the casting director for utilizing the gifted talents of international actors and not Hollywood's popular elite. Some may think Mel is ""wacko"" but after all there is a method to his madness or madness to his method that yields brilliant works such as Braveheart and now The Passion of the Christ...The passion for Gisbon's directing and vision surely comes through !Now, the film itself is a masterpiece in technical terms of cinematography, acting, costume and set design, special effects and soundtrack...Regardless if the dialogue was Aramaic or Latin, the subtitles did not hinder at all the action or watching the actors on screen. Nor do they deter the understanding of the story. The imagery varies from simply rich, panoramic, to haunting and nightmarish (involving scenes of the devil or his minions)! The artistic and skillful use of flashbacks to coincide with pivotal scenes (though every scene is practically pivotal) cannot be forgotten. One flashback involving Jesus as a beautiful and angelic curly headed toddler and a young Virgin Mother running to comfort him from a fall will put a knot in anyone's throat.It is one of the most emotional flashbacks regardless if one is a parent or not... The image is strong and will stay in the mind for time to come.I did not view this film in the hopes of being ""entertained"" in the regular or superficial sense of the word. I went to be further ""educated"". I was.Way beyond what I had expected. If you have not seen this film, forget any controversy or preconceived notions.Take any controversy, negative reviews out of the equation, and even forget Mel Gibson directed this for just 2 hours and see the film as it stands on its own...If you can walk away from this film extracting something positive and taken to heart from the viewing experience, and it is an experience(whether spiritual, educational, or other ways) then count yourself amongst the enlightened ones and not those who have become outraged or bittered. Don't become caught up in the controversies and lose sight of what The Passion of the Christ is about; Christ.Just see it !",N/A

862196,"Irwin Winkler, the director of this film about Cole Porter, has chosen the device of the movie within the movie or play within the movie to present his story. Cole Porter (Kevin Klein) is an old man (wondrously made up incidentally) sitting in an empty auditorium watching his life unfold before him. There are many good reasons to see this movie, not the least of which is the score (words and music by Cole Porter). Both Klein and Ashley Judd do respectable jobs with their singing, which runs of course in the Judd family along with good looks. Some of the singing done by various artists is uneven; but seeing the movie made me want to buy a Cole Porter CD sung by someone with the talent of Ella Fitzgerald, for instance. Although the critics seem to be agog over Klein's acting-- and he is fine here-- certainly his performance is balanced by that of Ms. Judd, who does a beautifully nuanced portrait of Linda, Porter's (for the most part) understanding wife.Although Mr. Porter wrote wonderful music which is still bringing joy to a great many people, his marriage, particularly in his later life, if the movie is accurate, was not always happy. There is never any question, however, that the love between the Porters was true and enduring, in spite of Porter's other gay ""night"" life. The film is quite moving; the stranger sitting next to me wept several times in the movie and I heard sniffles behind me.The movie is beautifully filmed.

The cinematography by Leon Shamroy, along with the massive sets and luxurious costumes (all three were Oscar nominated but lost out to &quot;An American in Paris&quot;) make this a fabulous &quot;sword and sandals&quot; epic; it also boasts a dramatic score by Alfred Newman, and one of my favorite dance sequences on film, by the brilliant Jack Cole.

I didn't like his faux-British character in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  However, he does a great job with an African accent here.  I am sure that many viewers will think he's directly from the Continent when they see this.  Though the real life story probably happened in French, these English-speaking actors did a great job.  African children's singing and rain give rich detail to the story being told here.Given all the controversy surrounding the Simpson trial, ""Waiting to Exhale,"" and baby daddy jokes, it's finally good to see a unified Black family.  Cheadle plays a strong, Black father reminiscent of Cosby during the 1980s.  Devoted fathers of all races and nationalities will be touched by the dynamics of the nuclear unit featured here.This film was suspenseful; I'm sure that every audience member sat on the edge of their seat.  However, like ""E.R.,"" the results of violence is shown, rather than the violence itself.  I'm worried that the lack of violence will allow viewers to minimize what happened in the 1990s.  It's hard to emphasize the tragedy of genocide when no killing is shown directly.I am worried about how some will respond to this film.  It makes the U.N. and peace advocates look naive and racist.  This film could play easily into the hands of those who want to justify war, especially current wars, HINT-HINT!

Racism and the oppression of those in the developing world is mentioned.  Still, this movie makes Blacks, especially those on the Continent, look very bad.  Moreover, the fetishization and hording of beer among the Blacks in this film particularly worried me.  Belgium, the former colonizers, take no blame in what happens here which is very problematic.In addition, this may make some viewers condemn free speech.  Throughout this film, a radio station advocates Hutu power.  It almost felt like hearing a faceless Orwellian Big Brother.  Still, we have radio personalities in the US that appall me.  I hope this movie doesn't want to suggest the same shouldn't happen in the Motherland.Question:  why did the oppressive majority tribe have pictures of white hands shaking on their clothing?Above all, I loved this film.  It is worthy of all Oscars.  The work will make viewers think seriously about asylum, genocide, and postcolonialism.",Hotel Rwanda

It also had scenes that reminded me of better horror films.  A killer is pursuing brides to be, slashing his way down the aisle.  Predictable in spots, s-l-o-w direction, and a confusing script brings this film down to nothing special. Tom Hanks appears briefly in the film.  He looks SO young that it really makes this film looked dated.  There is some good acting in this film, and has a few chilling spots.

620964,"It's only a testament to how good a director Ron Howard is that I write to express my disappointment in this really slow-moving film.It just never really seems to come together on any level.  Howard's films are traditionally extremely character driven and I was shocked when that seemed to be the movie's main failing.  What drove Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones's characters were just never really explored.  It wasn't for lack of time either, clocking in at over two hours, the film was far too long.I don't want to give the wrong impression either; it certainly wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.  It's more that when Howard's on we get movies like Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind.  I was really disappointed that, by the bar he set for himself, this film is WAY below his ability.

841696,"Doctor Sam Beckett ( Scott Bakula) has created an accelerator chamber that allows a person to travel in time back and forth within the confines of their own lifetime. Unfortunately, the people funding the project are not convinced that it works. So in order to prove that the accelerator works, Sam leaps prematurely before the system is fully operational. He is lept back in time, and his soul is forced into another person's body. Sam's only link to his own time is his best friend and fellow co-worker Al Calavicci ( Dean Stockwell) who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear. In order to move on, Sam must put something right that went wrong in the person's life that he lept into. From that moment on, Sam leaps from life to life, hoping each time that his next leap, will be the leap home.Quantum Leap is without a doubt my favorite television show of all time. The show featured an extremely original perspective on time travel. I love the fact that even though Sam's soul or essence if you will, would leap from life to life, he would always assume the physical characteristics of the person that he would leap into. One of the best parts of each episode, would be seeing the reflection of the person in the mirror. Each episode also showcased extremely realistic set designs as well. Each time period that Sam lept into was recreated very effectively. Quantum Leap also managed to keep you in suspense, despite the fact you always knew that Sam would save the day. However, the show could not have succeeded without Scott Bakula or Dean Stockwell. They were so great together on screen, that they could literally pass for best friends in real life. They had the best on screen chemistry of any two actors that I have ever seen.The second season of Quantum Leap was the first complete season of the show, and this is when the show really started to catch its footing as the best show I have ever seen. The entire season is top notch from beginning to end. Some of my favorite season two episodes include : Good Morning, Peoria - in which Sam leaps into a rock n' roll DJ named Howlin' Chick Howell, to keep the radio station where he's employed from being shut down by overly conservative town elders, Another Mother - in which Sam leaps into a divorced mother of three, to prevent his teenage son from running away, and his youngest daughter can see both Sam's true self and Al, Pool Hall Blues - in which Sam leaps into a pool shark to save his grandaughter's small bar from the slimy loan shark holding a note on the place, and M.I.A. - in which Sam leaps into the life of an undercover cop, and Al tries to use the leap as a way of making Sam prevent his first wife Beth from finally giving up hope and marrying another man.Season two of Quantum Leap is coming to DVD on October 26, 2004. While it is unclear what the extras may be, this is definately a set worth picking up just for the episodes themselves. Overall, Quantum Leap is one of the few shows that is worth collecting the entire run of on DVD, because almost every episode of the entire show was enjoyable.A solid 5 stars...",N/A

250678,"I enjoy Walt Disney films and shows on television and had grown to like the tv show The Wonderful World of Disney.  I had not been to Disneyland yet, but had seen pictures and images on television.  Bedknobs and Broomsticks was probably the first Walt Disney motion picture I saw at a drive-in.  I had never seen a magical film like this.  To be honest, I wasn't too taken by Lansbury (I like her now!).  I was probably thinking of a different actress on another bewitching show.  But I enjoyed the special effects and the flying brass bed.  The knights with invisible people inside stuck in my mind.  They had an exhibit at the drive-in snack bar where the knights suit of armor was displayed.  I was too young to figure it all out about the special effects, but what was nice is that the Walt Disney Company could make magical films and give me nice dreams.  I have learned to respect all that is Disney.  Now I am 41 and have an almost grown daughter.  I just saw the restored version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  I found the film to still be a delight.  Like Angela Lansbury!  Still like Walt Disney films.  Still like the fantasy of it all. And have been to Disneyland many times.  Wouldn't we all like to have a bedknob that could do that.  That poor scruffy black cat.  I did have a nice black cat for 13 years.The 30th Anniversary edition is the restored version with nearly 23 minutes of footage found and added into the film.  This time the film is more fun, enjoyable and easier to understand.  At the end of the film is a featurette with Angela Lansbury and the Sherman Brothers.Trvia Note: Did you know the Walt Disney Company and Angela Lansbury have the same birthdate?

619703,"The problem with this movie is that it doesn't really know what it wants to say.  It is artfully done, however, with a lot of quiet, gentle touches, and it is very pretty to look at, so you're not supposed to notice.  But it takes no risks, and leaves you nothing to mull over when you walk out of the theater.  It's a bit of fluff--a pretty bit of fluff to be sure--but a bit of fluff nevertheless.  What is bizarre is that this beginner's piece has garnered so much solemn critical praise.Bill Murray plays an actor who is in Tokyo to take part in a commercial for some kind of booze.  He hates Tokyo, he hates Japan, and he hates the commercial he is doing.  From the telephone conversations he has with his wife and the faxes that are sent to him from his family, we are meant to realize that he doesn't particularly care about them either.  He's completely bored and cynical about everything, and he sits around in the hotel lounge in the evening listening to awful lounge music and drinking.  In the meantime, we are told that for this job he is making two million dollars, and he is accosted on several occasions by strangers who recognize him from the many film roles he played earlier in his career.  He is thankless for all that he has and for all that he has been able to do, and is an utterly unlikable, contemptible human being.So far, so good.  Undoubtedly, there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this in Hollywood, stewing in their juices because of some idiotic part they didn't get, or angry that they must travel to Japan or Australia for a publicity stunt they consider to be beneath their dignity.  Oh, how one yearns for a contemporary movie like this, one which satirically exposes the over-inflated ego and vapidity of the Hollywood star.But unfortunately, very early on, we realize that this is not going to be the case.  Instead we are meant to empathize with this Murray character.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him!  The Japanese really are goofy and buffoonish.  Their city really is a pinball machine, with neon electronica, videos and shallowness portrayed everywhere.  They don't understand English--the clods--no matter how condescendingly Mr. Murray tries to explain things to them.All of the jokes, few as they are, are made at the expense of the Japanese.  Murray is taller than them.  He looks at us bleakly over their heads.  They greet him every morning in an ingratiatingly polite manner.  He's bored.  He makes ugly jokes about their food, comparing it at one point to his new friend's bruise:  ""Black toe,"" he derisively orders.  They don't understand.  We're supposed to laugh.  How wonderful it would be for the Sushi chef to announce to him that he indeed understands English, and crack him over the head with a rolling pin.  But no.  The chef instead is an incomprehending, smiling moron, and the smirking Mr. Murray is oh so clever.So he meets this girl--freshly graduated from Yale, very pretty and improbably a philosophy major--who is just as lonely as he.  (Will Hollywood please stop trying to portray philosophy or math or science majors?  They can't.)  Her husband is a photographer and he's gone all the time, so one night she buys Mr. Murray--thirty years her senior--a drink, and they subsequently go out and do a few things together, and oh, how touching, they help to make each other feel a little less lonely.  They never have sex.  And that's the plot.But what in the world are we supposed to think about this?  That Japan is some sort of lost hell in which white people must cling to one another?  That beautiful young women far from home can be comforted by cynical, drunken old men?  Really, and seriously, what is the point?There is a moment or two when it appears that the director, Sofia Coppola, was trying for one.  There is a great scene in which Murray is playing golf, on a beautiful green course, alone, and with an incredible Mt. Fuji as a backdrop.  What a lucky guy, we think.  How can he be so unhappy?  But very quickly after we are again manipulated into believing that things truly are an awful nightmare for him, and that it is only his burgeoning relationship and his quirky sense of humor that are pulling him through.  Some nightmare.This basic contradiction is why the movie fails.  Why should we, the nine-to-five, slobbering, popcorn-fed public, feel sorry for this self-centered, pampered ass?So it misses, and misses badly.  It may be Murray, who is clearly out of his league, playing the role the same way he's played everything else:  the wise-cracking, likable, sardonic smart-aleck.  (How can he have been nominated for an Academy award for this?  He's done it forever and it is clearly out of place here.)  Or is it Coppola, who was unable to rein him in, or perhaps too inexperienced to have a firmer understanding of this subtle theme?Hard to tell.  It should be said, though, that this is not an awful or horrible movie.  Indeed, from a director so young, it shows a great deal of promise.  But to have been successful the film needed a director with far more maturity, or an actor with far, far more depth.",Lost in Translation
466360,"NBC created a two-part epic of the story of Noah's Ark.  It was created by the team that did Merlin and Alice in Wonderland but will probably be remembered as being by the same people who did The Tempest.  It was really bad.Just how bad the show was can probably be summed up by saying that in one scene Noah greeted Lot.  For those a little rusty on their Old Testament, Noah can be found in Genesis chapter 6 while Lot is Genesis chapter 19.  This epic opened with the tale of Lot (minus Abraham) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (also minus Abraham).One thing that really puzzled me about this production was the way the locals kept treating Noah as if he were a fool.  This puzzles me because the locals all knew that Noah had the only farm in the land where anything would grow.  So would frustrated and hungry farmers merely laugh at Noah or would they hate him and raid his farm?  I was also amused when some of the locals began quoting Shakespeare.  At another point a Michael Palin look-alike runs up dressed in rags and with a long scraggly beard and says, &quot;Its.&quot;  A brief moment of humor for Monty Python fans but I don't know why it was in there.But the writers of Noah's Ark did take from one good source, mainly the Broadway musical Two by Two starring Danny Kaye.  Unfortunately the stolen scene was one of Noah's sons claiming the Ark was not finished because it did not have a rudder.  Now if he were right and the Ark needed a rudder then God made a mistake.  But it would also meant that Noah's son would have to be strong enough to operate a rudder on a boat three-hundred cubits in length.  But the ark was built by God and not Noah.  The writers also kept pushing the idea that an ark is a boat.  No, but Noah's Ark took the form of a boat.  An ark is simply a sacred container for the safe storage of something precious.  Any fan of Indiana Jones knows that (or did he dig up a boat in Tannis?).This production is available on video and DVD and my recommendation is that it should be avoided.",Noah's Ark

Suffice it to say it's a common word starting with the letter C, something you see every day (ahem).At the beginning of ""My Favorite Year,"" the writing staff for King Kaiser's (Sid Caesar's) comedy show is reviewing the swashbuckling films of Alan Swan (Eroll Flynn), who's going to be the guest star that week.

""Captain from [Stuff]!"" is Macy's response.The same could be said about the TV output of William Hannah and Joseph Barbera. [Stuff]. Utter, total, unmitigated [stuff].Hannah and Barbera had a stellar career at MGM, where they produced a long series of ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons, taking home the animated-short-subject Oscar for more than a decade. I don't much care for ""Tom and Jerry,"" but you can't deny these cartoons were beautifully drawn and animated. The first of the series, ""Mr. Cat Steps Out,"" is one of the best animated shorts ever made.The Supreme Court anti-trust decision that divested the major studios of their theaters removed the principal outlet for new cartoons. This, combined with the rising cost of animation after WWII, meant that by the early '50s, high-quality animated shorts were no longer economically viable.Not wanting to starve, Hannah and Barbera turned to television, where they were among to the first to produce cartoons using limited animation (ie, only a few cels per second; drawing only the part of the character that moved; heavy use of movement cycles).The first of these (IIRC), was ""Ruff and Reddy,"" an adventure series featuring a dog and a cat. It's an obvious lift of Jay Ward's ""Crusader Rabbit,"" and though it lacked the satirical thrust of the former, my memory is that it was occasionally amusing and sometimes charming. Everything after was [stuff]. Total [stuff].Starting with ""Huckleberry Hound,"" Hannah and Barbera churned out a huge pile of witless, humorless [stuff]. I'd go as far as to say that it is the _biggest_ pile of artistic [stuff] in the entire history of Western civilization. (I'm not joking.)""The Flintstones"" was the first prime-time animated series. That's its only legitimate distinction, as there's nothing else _worth_ saying about such a total mediocrity. The characters are lifted from ""The Honeymooners,"" and the plots are the same tired sitcom rehashes that were ancient when the series premiered.The idea that a series set in the Stone Age might be used to meaningfully comment on contemporary life doesn't seem to have crossed the writers' minds. Their idea of ""satire"" was such things as a Hollyrock actor named Cary Granite. Wow! Isn't that just side-splittingly hilarious? I can't stop laughing! How clever! How creative! How [stuff]y.""The Flinstones"" is contemporary with ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" and ""The Dick van Dyke Show."" Even by current standards, both are considered models of wit and solid comedy writing. ""The Flintstones"" isn't within even a couple of parsecs.If you want to see what ""The Flinstones"" _could_ have been, take a look at ""Dinosaurs."" (It's surprising Disney hasn't issued the better episodes on DVD. ""When Food Goes Bad"" is a classic.) Ditto -- cubed -- for ""The Jetsons"" and ""Futurama.""If I were Bill Gates, I'd buy the rights to all of Hannah and Barbera's TV ""creations,"" then publicly _burn_ every surviving negative, print, videotape, cel, and piece of artwork. They deserve no less.PS: What can you say about a theme song that invites the viewer to have ""a gay old time""? If there's one thing ""The Flintstones"" _isn't_, it's gay.

511682,"I first heard good things about this ""quirky little Aussie flick"" a number of years ago but only got around to seeing it myself last night.  What probably put me off (to be completely honest) was that it's an Australian film.  And you know what they say about Aussies - they're all outlaw heathen scum, so what could they possibly know about making good movies.  Right?Well knock me over with a didgeridoo mate - Rob Sitch has created a wee beauty of a film.  Despite its Australian heritage, The Castle has bucket loads of charm and is a thoroughly entertaining movie with plenty of laughs and good feeling.After watching so many films in recent years about dysfunctional families (think American Beauty, Ice Strom, The Royal Tennebaums etc) it really is a treat to see such a positive depiction of family life.  The Kerrigan's really are perfectly content with their lot in life.  They might be simple but they do love each other, love their castle, support each other and laugh together.  While others may look down their noses at this working class clan the Kerrigan's don't care (in fact, if the truth be known, they're probably too dumb to notice - as Aussies often are) because they have the greatest gift of all - a nurturing home.  And strewth mate, who could want more than that!A couple of minor quibbles:  although it is funny, the humor is more of the quirky Aussie variety and at times a bit too - well, Australian really.  So while I found myself smiling through most of the movie, I wouldn't call The Castle a screaming comedy.  It's more off-beat and quirky.Also, the final quarter of the film seems a little bit rushed to me.  Things were looking tough for the Kerrigan's there at one stage and then all of a sudden (right out of the blue mate) comes a white knight to save the day.  You beauty!  Yeah, right.

I saw this film simply because I thought I can see awesome 'Bill' image, the kind of Oscar worthy terrific performance from Carradine.Sorry, but no such things here, partly because of the film's weak script and the equally weak acting from Carradine.  He plays the titular 'Monster Hunter' from FBI, in a MIB suit, who investigates the serial killer case in a small town in Texas.  His method is very unconventional -- some ritualistic prayer before lit candlesticks, for instance -- and not exactly a hero of the film.Actually, 'Monster Hunter' is shot in a so-called mocumentary style, showing a series of interviews including the killer's mom, parents of victims, and the psychological analysis of one doctor.  Also you gradually come to know how the real killing was done through the narrative told in between.You soon realize that this is a film made in a tongue-in-cheek mood, twisting the rules of the horror genre.  The idea is interesting, but it has been done much more effectively in three 'Scream's, and compared to them, the mock documentary style is, I think, not a suitable one, for it always wavers  between feeble gags and tedious thriller.  There are some good moments -- either shoking or funny -- but they are not many in number.And like I said, Carradine is no Bill here, whose irresitible charms made Uma Thurman's 'the Bride' fall in love with the guy.

The Bridge on the River Kwai is somewhat based on a true story, the characters are fictional.  The movie is based on a book published in 1954 by a Frenchman who was an actual POW in S.E. Asia.  There were two bridges built over the river Kwai during WWII, a part of the Death Railway which ran through Thailand into Burma where the Japanese hoped to expand their operations.  This railway did claim thousands of lives due to exhaustion, tropical diseases, malnutrition, sometimes torture as this movie hints at by the shots of many crosses shown marking the graves of soldiers who died in the camp.  Nicholson and his officers are cast into ""ovens"" for days on end without food or water.  The medic for the camp goes to Saito pleading for their lives and gets the comment given in the title of this review.  Nicholson is dead set on principles, and somehow manages to outwit Saito, later nearly befriending him.  The clash of the two colonels is comical at times, and, as others have noted, the movie does not realistically depict the sufferings of POWs under the Japanese.  The movie, to me, is a story of survival, honor, and wits on the part of beleaguered POWs.  Whistling while on the march, building this bridge are important actions in maintaining the soldiers' morale.  Escaping the camp, planning to blow up the bridge are others!I saw this film on TV, probably in the very early 70's with my dad, my family's war movie buff.  I've always wanted to whistle a tune like the British soldiers under Nicholson.  I've always remembered this movie.  This movie is such a classic, still so very suspenseful, no matter how many times it's seen.  Recommended!!!",N/A
607700,"Equilbrium is one of those movies that are very unnoticed cause of overrated films like The Matrix and all that yadi yada.  I happend to rent this film on the recommendation of my friend who said the film is absolutley brilliant and awesome so I gave this a try.  I must say this film was extreamly well done.  The plot was pretty damn good, the Actor were great(even Taye Diggs and I'm not a fan of him at all)and the action is amazing.  I've read some reviews saying this film is just mostly mindless violence and nothing els.  Well I must say you're just an idiot or you have not payed attention to this movie at all.The plot is really cool and I'm not gonna spoil it for you but it has some really great elements.  Christian Bale did an awesome job playing Prestan Cleric.  I don't think they could have gotten a better person to play him and I will say this to all those Matrix fanboys out there This film outdoes the whole trilogy!  That's right, Equilibrium has fantastic Characters and a great plot and I must say the choreographer did a great job with the action.  That's were the movie gets really good..The action in this film unlike the matrix which almost all CGI this film has some real action(atleast that's what I thought)and I must say Christian Bale did the job right.  Some of the best and Amazing gun fights I've ever seen(mainly the final battle with Preston and Father)and I must say it wont disapoint.  The action totally outdoes the Matrix and as previous reiviewers have said, you cannot compare this with the Matrix at all mainly cause the're just totally different movies!  Besides the amazing action and gun fights one of the coolest parts in the film are the characters outfits, very rockin' and cool to wear and it's even better then the Matrix outfits.The only problem I had was the film felt a tad bit short and there should have bint a tad bit more Action.Overall with a Cool Plot, Great costume outfit, amazing gunfights/katana fights/ect(though needed some more action)and cool villans like the Father I give it a4.6 out of 5 stars...Lates",Equilibrium
600674,"The word that first came to mind when this movie was over was that this film was very &quot;professional.&quot;  Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson both give solid performances, subtle but filled with suppressed tension.  What makes this movie all the more provocative is that it is based on actual events that took place in 1961, certainly at the very peak of the Cold War.  The huge cast of character actors also come across well with admirable performances.  The fact that the Cold War is over makes for a dated feel to the story.  Also, the movie is about 15-20 minutes longer than my attention could handle, the pace being so deliberate.  There were moments when I recalled the greatest Submarine film ever made, &quot;Das Boot.&quot;  That should be praise enough for all involved in the making of this strong, compelling film.",N/A
787818,"As an Abbott & Costello fan since about 1947, dating back to BUCK PRIVATES COME HOME, I waited years for what I felt at the time of the first Universal release of the A&C collection was a ""supreme achievement of the DVD era"" (2004). Well, in a way it was, but primarily for the idea of packaging all of a star's films in one collection.  Since that time,Universal has released a much more complete collection of their Universal only films, called ABBOTT AND COSTELLO: THE COMPLETE UNIVERSAL PICTURES COLLECTION, but this time did a few things better, including the previously omitted It Ain't Hay and providing a superior set of remastered and repackaged discs, perhaps in reponse to all the compaints they received.  It's not that this collection is terrible or not worth keeping, but the newer A&C collection is much improved.  And now Time Warner Archives has remastered Rio Rita, Meet Captain Kidd, and The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock (Lou alone), satisfying ""completists'"" requirements, although I thought Jack and the Beanstalk should have been remastered, too.",N/A
810193,"THE ALAMO suffered in its theatrical release because of the flap it received in the media, articles condemning its production history and personal swings at far too many people.  Had all of those gossipy rumors not surfaced, perhaps the public might have been able to view this solid American history re-enactment for what it is - a well written, character driven, well acted blockbuster grand movie.  Yes, it is lengthy, but the length itself helps communicate the intensity and inevitable failure of the 13-day battle for the Alamo in 1836.  Disparate characters are drawn together from various regions of the young United States for personal reasons, most of those reasons initially were in response to frontierism and greed, but gradually mutated into camaraderie and pride for country. The siege of the Alamo by the Mexican forces led by General Santa Anna (well portrayed by Emilio Echevarria) defeats and slaughters the likes of mythic heroes Davy Crockett (another fine performance imbued with subtlety by Billy Bob Thornton), Jim Bowie (Jason Patrick) and LtCol William Travis (a fine role for the increasingly interesting Patrick Wilson - 'Angels in America').  Within the walls of the Alamo we learn each character's private and public history, a technique in writing that makes the well-known defeat of this small band of clever men even more sad.  Once the Alamo is taken, General Santa Anna decides to fragment his large army in order to attack the remaining general Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid), but Houston's lessons of Napoleon and Wellington were well learned and the final battle of the movie is ingenious. And Mexico ceded Texas to the US.  A small but important character, Jaun Sequin (played by the gifted Argentinean actor Jordi Molla of 'Second Skin' and 'Blow' fame) brings continuity and closure to this grand scale movie in an intimate way that makes us all once again stop and consider about the madness of war.  This well photographed, well-directed movie deserves wide attention!",N/A
706796,"What really happened during this 'scandal' on a yatch where a film producer met his abrupt end amid a wild weekend of booze, charleston swinging, and dope?We'll never truly know, but the film is a peppy cavalcade of big name stars playing big name stars. It's a character-heavy motion picture so let's discuss the impersonations.Dunst is the flavour of the month, she makes Davies look like an attractively complex figure. While reflecting the verve of a young privileged woman at an exciting time, she maintains a moral core without really being certain of precisely what she wants, which rings true.The flamboyant Eddie Izzard was a surprise in the cast but made an atypically understated Chaplin. You see the intelligence and yearning in his eyes, the sly wit dripping from his casual tilts of the head.Personally, I felt these two were the only admirable actors in the film. The rest of the crew members acted as though they were in a much dopier movie. Herrmann for instance plays Hearst, the big tycoon, as a buffoon channeled through Bill Murray, huffing and puffing when he feels betrayed, grinning goofily and almost cross-eyed when he appears giddy.The film overall is a very watchable one though, particularly if you can overlook a needlessly sepia tone across the board giving a pseudo-noir look. The idea clearly was less to weave a murder mystery yarn and more to splice together the interactions among people at the scene of a high-society and thus hush-hush crime.",N/A

630290,"I just have to say, having seen this film last night upon its release on DVD, that it will soon be joining my film collection, a Bush re-election be damned. This is the most important documentary (and yes, it is a documentary) in my lifetime, in any of our lifetimes.Whether or not you're a dyed-in-the-wool Moore-phile (and believe me, I have reservations about the man), this film will make you think twice about our sitting president. No other filmmaker would've dared to take on the Bushes like this, and Moore should be commended, no, thanked by every American who loves this country and loves it honestly (not the kind of ""Mommy can never do wrong"" style of the neocons, possibly the most un-American group since the John Birch Society).I found the film just as powerful as I had heard (living in the South, Fahrenheit had a limited run around here at best, with some theaters not even showing it). The scenes of Iraq during the war (and the human toll it is taking) will break the heart of even the most diehard Bush-lover. I challenge anyone to question the mother who lost her son in terms of whether he died for the right cause. It's all well and good to say that this is a ""just war"". Just be sure you're honest enough when it strikes home.The issues I have with the film are the suggestions that we entered Afghanistan to erect a pipeline, and nothing more. That to me is too awful of a premise, too ""Dr. Strangelove""-ian for me to fathom, but I can't help but wonder. Also, the ties to the Bin Laden family are slight, in many ways, but again you can't help but wonder if Moore is really loony or not to suggest them. It's a damning document of the Bush Administration's efforts to have it both ways (stay on alert, but shop), and the inefficancy of the Administration to combat terror in ways that are effective (as opposed to harassing a man in a gym simply because he questioned the President's motives in Afghanistan, which is shockingly something I suspect more commonplace than we'd like to think).Whether this will change anyone's minds (specifically those who plan to vote Bush), I can't say for sure. I'd like to think no one could be so close-minded as to not even consider seeing it, but I've been wrong before. This is far and away the most important movie of this year, and it is a masterpiece.Some might argue, ""Moore made this film simply to unseat Bush,"" but after seeing it, I can't say I don't blame him. I want the son of a bitch out of office, roasting on the eternal flames of hell, myself, especially after viewing this film. And if that's wrong or ""un-American"" of me, then so be it. We need change, and ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" shows us why.",Fahrenheit 9/11

148671,"Tim Roth gives a mesmerizing and commanding performance in this exceptional thriller.  Roth plays the suspect in a brutal murder of a prostitute.  He is brought in for lie detector test by detectives Chris Penn and Michael Rooker.  Roth proves to be an exceptionally good liar, and a cat and mouse game ensues.  Seems like our policemen have their own secrets, too.  Penn is in debt to a bookie (played by a malicious Ellen Burstyn) for $20,000.  Rooker's wife (Rosanna Arquette) is having an affair with her obstetrician.  Somehow the extremely rich Roth knows all of this and uses it.Renee Zelweger portrays the murder victim, and although she's not used a whole lot, she has some compelling scenes and evidence of her talent is blossoming.Directors and Jonah and Joshua Pate have some effective camera angles; only the movie's ambiguous ending leaves one a little disappointed.  But Roth's performance is great, and you should enjoy the tension.  Rooker and Penn are also outstanding; Rooker is one of our most underappreciated actors.",N/A
82222,"There seems to be two schools of thought regarding this movie.  There are those who are unable to see past Julia's profession, and all it might entail, and there are those who see how someone who clearly had to make a bad choice one day realized it, and along the way helped someone else realize the bad choices they had made.  It's all a charming fairy tale that I have watched over and over again.Julia Roberts does play a prostitute.  However, as the movie unfolds we find out why.  Further, we also find that Julia is, as she must be, human, and has the same core values that most of us have.  Richard Gere helps her realize during their discussions that she made a poor choice, and eventually Julia realizes that she can be and wants to be more than she is.During Julia's journey of discovery she also makes Richard Gere question the path in life that he has chosen.  Richard buys companies, takes them apart, and sells the pieces for more than he paid for them.  While it has made Richard a very wealthy man, Julia questions the value that Richard brings to the world.  As Julia realizes that she wants more self-fulfillment in her life, Richard realizes that he wants to be constructive instead of destructive.Julia's character could have been played in an exploitive way that demeaned her character, and her character's profession.  Instead, I thought the subject was handled sensitively and well.  Julia several times could have behaved just as Richard would have expected someone in her profession, and yet, she showed that she had pride and values, and she stuck to them, even to her detriment.  Ultimately Richard Gere, and the audience, comes to admire Julia Roberts as a strong woman with an incredible will.In addition to Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is an outstanding supporting cast, including Laura San Giacomo as Julia's friend and roommate, and who gives Julia no end of despair in her choices.  Hector Elizondo plays Barney Thompson, the hotel manager, and he makes the role and steals every scene in which he appears.  Jason Alexander plays a rather despicable right hand man to Richard Gere, calloused, ruthless and crude.  Ralph Bellamy is the head of a business that Richard Gere is attempting to take over, and who gives Richard the best compliment in the entire film, marking a turning point in Richard Gere's attitude about what he does.  There is a long list of other actors that made so many of the scenes in this movie funny and sometimes poignant.  Better you should watch this movie and find out for yourself.This movie is one of Richard Gere and Julia Robert's best films.  We have both the video tape and the DVD, and have watched both multiple times, and will likely watch the DVD many more times.

549406,"Being familiar with the Gormenghast trilogy but having missed the dramatisation of it on television I bought this pair of videos thinking that they would cover the story of the first two books. I was not expecting the third, in which Prince Titus flees Gormenghast into the modern world outside, and which is a different story, indeed a different type of story, altogether. Not so, in the event. This film takes us a certain way into the second book, but it leaves the narrative suspended in a way that suggests that we are to expect more. Whether this expectation is valid I have no idea at all.I certainly hope it is, because I give this production very high marks indeed. It seems to me far better than some of the critical comment suggested at the time. It gets the `feel' of the story for me quite brilliantly. The plot-line is `strange' up to a point because its author, though inspired and original, had more than a few screws loose in the top storey. However the strangeness seems to me to have been greatly overstated, I believe because of the very self-conscious and affected style of writing at the start of the first book. In fact this relaxes into a fairly normal idiom after a few pages, much as the initial harmonic style of Wagner's Tristan only lasts a few bars. The Gormenghast trilogy is fantasy of a fairly familiar type. It depicts the ambience of a huge castle that is a world on its own. It has been there for a thousand years, one gathers, but how it got built, where it might be, how its economy sustains itself and how it manages to avoid contact with the world outside are things one simply does not ask. It is a living museum, dedicated to tradition. Its inmates are a weird harlequinade certainly, but still recognisable human beings, sometimes caricatures, sometimes very realistic indeed, never in my view totally incredible. I don't read it as any kind of allegory, and the satirical elements are random and not focused around any particular theme. I detect no political stance, either in the depiction of traditionalism to the nth degree or in the socialistic views expressed by Steerpike - he was a villain indeed but the author is fairly neutral towards him and of course it would be completely illegitimate to assume that he actually meant what he was saying.That is my reading of the books, and that is the way this film comes over to me. The casting is nothing short of superlative. Peake was also an artist (a very talented one) and we have his own pictures of some of the dramatis personae. Miss Prunesquallor here is almost Peake's drawing to the life. It would have been more or less impossible, I suppose, to find an actor who looked like Peake's Steerpike, but Jonathan Rhys Meyers carries off the part with aplomb and with a lot of the suggestion of Peake's narrative despite being handsome and personable. The casting of Warren Mitchell as Barquentine is sheer genius. The Countess herself has the right suggestion of a woman with a powerful brain who turns it on and off as the situation requires, Princess Fuchsia is a wonderful piece of enactment of a teenage girl, and I want to put in a special word for the quite marvellous performance turned in by June Brown (familiar to British soap-opera watchers as Dot Cotton of East Enders) as Nanny Slagg. I could go on. Maybe Stephen Fry is on the young side as professor Bellgrove, but my goodness he has style, and I hardly need comment on what to expect from the likes of Christopher Lee and Ian Richardson.They can't leave it hanging like this - can they? It may be that having covered the contents of one-and-a-half books they are now faced with the problem (which I wouldn't like to try and solve) of how to combine the rest of the second book with the third, which as I say is a horse of another colour. One oddity in such a careful and professional production - my edition of the books, and the sleeve of my videos, know how to spell `Fuchsia', whereas the princess herself doesn't. I have a definite suspicion that none of them did.",Gormenghast

319678,"I cannot add anything to the plot synopses detailed here by other reviewers.  All I have to say about this film is that it is indeed worth a look, if simply to see Bette Davis past her prime years at Warner Bros.The film is talky and if you can sit through it all in one sitting without snoozing from time to time....(I had to watch it four times before I could see it all .....)....you are a great Bette Davis fan and my hat is off to you!This film does have its memorable moments and it is interesting to watch Davis subdued and restrained.  The last shot of the film is particularly moving.It is no surprise that this film did not do well at the box office when it was released in 1948.  Jack Warner, head of production at Warners was tired of Bette at this point and it would only take two more films before he was rid of her.  Studio politics were rampant in Hollywood and forgetting all the millions she made for the studio in the past, relegated her to mediocrity in films like Winter Meeting.However, the film does have its merits....the acting is good (Davis pulls it up to her level and Jim Davis is properly convincing as a war hero torn between a vocation for marriage and a vocation to the priesthood.)Davis made far worse debacles in her career and this film is different because it features Bette in a 'quiet' role for a change.......not one full of hammy mannerisms that tended to taint a lot of her other performances.

235124,"Everytime I see pictures of the flemish painter Heironymous Bosch and then see Lindsey Anderson in this movie I think, gee he looks just like Bosch; kinda makes movies like Bosch paints as well.  His loosely connected Mick Travis trilogy: if.., O' Lucky Man and Britannia Hospital often look like the typical Bosch tryptich, in which the left panel shows man's expulsion from a distorted forboding man's view of ""heaven""; in if..'s case a British authoritarian boarding school, while the right side of Bosch's tryptichs show the twisted tortuous hell that man merits from his sins on earth; in Britannia Hospital's case, an insane asylum diguised as a government run hospital where death is certain from the most disgustingly violent experiments and sponsered by bureaucratic sadists.  In the middle of these moralty paintings is the incendiary display of sins man commits.  And it is here that we often find the most engaging bits of Bosch's work where so much happens in an instant as viewing a painting, which, actually takes years to see it all.  O' Lucky Man is very much designed in this fashion even if it wasn't intentional.  We get elements from this movie that may never be fully realized again in film; a dismal prospect indeed.  Innovations actually abound with this revolutionary film.  We have it's soundrack and score composer not only effectively weigh commentary on the movie's long suffering but affably earnest protagonist Travis (played with astonishing exuberence and charm by Malcolm McDowell), but that the singer (Alan Price, formerly of the Animals) even interacts with him in the film.  As innovative and amusing as that technique was, the soundrack can still stand on it's own as one of the greatest and most relevant to a film plot ever written.  Tell anyone who goes on a job interview or for that matter, hates their job to listen to the world weary idiosyncratic bliss in the song Poor People, a song that sticks forever in the souls of those who loved this movie like honey melting on hot toast crumpets. All in all, a very touching ode to smiling down disaster.Many may twitch at the seemingly overindulgent symbolism going on and the lengthy running time and disjointed feel of this epic.  They may also get confused by the hilarious running gag of the actors playing repeated roles.  I found it fun beyond a roll in the hay to catch when each player shows up again and again several times over then bust out in laughter when Travis actually recognizes the lusciously charming Helen Mirren groupie character Patricia who showed up in episodes before his stint in jail, then looking at her talent agency clerk character with puzzling bewilderment a few moments later as if he had no clue.  As Mick, Malcolm McDowell can come off as enthusiastic and gullible then believably struggle with frustration, cynicism, and finally dogged determination to be ""good"" then giving up only to be thwacked back into his trademark grin.  The writing is all over his vastly expressive face and makes this one of his most unforgettable portrayals, completly abscent is the casual sadism that has garnered him praise but unfortunate typecasting down the road.  This is a must see movie for fans of his villian work who want to see his range; simply brilliant work.It is also a film that is astonishingly relevant to how capitalist societies still function.  We're often amazed at how we haven't changed much from our need to divest in our homeland to rape another for the needs of the selfish.  Granted the film is long and bitingly sardonic and perhaps that idealism causes a slower decay then Anderson might have imagined.  Still, many of the films relevant lines about dying like dogs, radio commentary on Zen and revolution being the opium of the intellectuals ring strong in the hearts of anyone who questions their own existence and worth in the world.  This seems to be the one true everyman type of film as surreal as it may be.  There is just something so satisfying in just hearing the characters walking, which sounds strikingly like marching.  And it happens almost everytime before our poor boy Travis gets a beating.  It is a movie that has to be seen and heard repeatedly. Defintely buy this film.  For anyone who cares, if you managed to tape the uncut British version of the film when it ran on some obscure cable stations back in the early 90s, you may have gold in your hands; the deleted 'My Home Town' suicide sequence is there.  Yes, like a Boscsh picture, there is so much to see in this gem and we are all the luckier for having it in our lives.",O Lucky Man VHS
739535,"So many people are tied up in the politics of Michael Moore, they fail to realize that documentary is an art form.  It is an artistic means through which to examine a thesis.  I like Moore's work in general, but find the &quot;Columbine&quot; film to be sorely lacking in clarity.  In a nutshell, the film's thesis (assuming it has one) is kind of &quot;wishy-washy&quot;.  I watched the film once and kept waiting for Mike to &quot;get to the point&quot; and found that his gift for sardonically presenting bitter ironies and &quot;slapping viewers awake&quot; was wasted on subject matter that is perhaps best left in the perview of Criminologists.  Then, to see if it had any redeeming educational value, I watched it again and drew the same conclusion about the movie.  I was very disappointed.As I said, I like Moore and I will gladly rethink this review if someone can prove me wrong by telling me in a sentence or two, what *exactly* the thesis is.  Is it a statement on the state of youth of America?  Is it a statement about spoiled rich kids who kill their classmates?  Is it a statement about parents, the educational system...gun control...what...why?  Who is to blame for the terrible events in Columbine?  Alas, the film raises tons of questions, but answers none.While many people have criticized the film for pushing a political agenda related to gun control, this is perhaps Moore's most objective documentary.  People who see an &quot;anti-gun agenda&quot; in this film are just seeing what they want to see based on thier emotions about Moore.While watching Columbine, I actually got the feeling that Moore himself was uncomfortable with the grayness of the subject matter.  It's almost as if Moore was aware that a strong pro-gun control argument would put him at odds with the constitutional freedoms that he has spent the better moments of his career defending.  As a result, the film tends to branch out into too many areas (such as Militia groups, popular music, popular cultural notions about guns, etc.) leaving the viewer with a general impression that yes, we do live in a &quot;Gun Culture&quot; - but knowing this fact may or may not provide any adequate solution to the next Columbine.The result of the muddled thesis, however, might have given  Moore the appearance of &quot;neutrality&quot; that I suppose it takes to win an Oscar.  Or perhaps that was Hollywood's indirect way of acknowledging that he had deserved credit for earlier (and much better) work.  No matter, fans of Mike will acknowledge that he is better as a documentarian when his work puts him at odds with big corporations and big government.  He should stay away from the &quot;garden-variety&quot; crime issue.Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this film is it's break away from the traditional &quot;Moore style&quot; which is laced with genuine humor and clever camera-work.  There are a few chuckles when Moore opens an savings account at a Northern Michigan bank and gets a &quot;free shotgun&quot; for his patronage, but the film is otherwise humorless.  The camera-work in the film is as sophmoric as any piece on 60 minutes.  Contrast this to Mike's quick-cut camerawork and shocking transitions in Roger and Me!With regard to Moore's the issue of content, the movie doesn't fare to well either with Mike bouncing footage around from Militia groups to interviews with celebs, and so on.  There seems to be no linearity in his presentation whatsoever.Moore is definitely out of form on this one.  I would however, give him two stars.  One for a valiant effort to root out the etiology of the Columbine incident. And another for showing enough refrain so as not to make any sweepingly bold and overpowering statements in the foggy area of gun control, in spite of the way in which many people seem to have interpreted Bowling for Columbine.",Bowling For Columbine VHS

731049,"It's gritty. It's dirty. It's violent and scary. It has little ash crosses on it. In a nutshell, it's Edward Burns' latest movie, &quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; a surprisingly  poignant and thrilling action movie about two Irish-American brothers caught in a very dangerous position.  Though it's a little uneven, especially in the first half, the intensity makes it worth seeing.The date is Ash Wednesday, 1980. The place: Hell's Kitchen. Sean Sullivan (Elijah Wood) is tending bar when he overhears three thugs plotting to kill his brother Francis (Edward Burns). So takes out a gun and kills all three of them to keep Francis alive. After that night, everyone hears that Sean is dead, and life continues for Francis and Sean's young wife (Rosario Dawson) for three years.What no one knows is that Sean is really alive. And soon Francis begins to hear rumors that Sean has been seen hanging around the neighborhood. Little brother wants his wife back (unaware that he now has a baby son). Problem is, if he is still alive, then there are some scores yet to be settled. And Francis may have to pay the price to keep his family safe.Revenge stories have been with us since... well, a very long time. And &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is noteworthy less for the complexity of its story (it really doesn't have any) than for HOW it's told. Family loyalty in movies is something that can rarely be done without sappiness, but amazingly Burns strips it down and makes it very moving. The first half is kind of slow, with a lot of Burns walking around and looking grim. But things pick up and compensate in the second half with more guns, dangerous strangers and family problems.Burns' directorial style is as gritty and shadowy as the place he sets his film in; the brief twenty-day shooting schedule probably added to the feeling of urgency. Symbolism abounds in Burns' latest flick; for example the ash crosses, part of a Roman Catholic ritual right before Lent, serve as a reminder of mortality. During some of the most important (and potentially deadly) scenes, Burns and Wood have those marks on their foreheads. It's a nice extra dimension, considering that most action flicks don't have more than one or two levels on them.Burns does an excellent job with a character who has a rather rotten past, and now has a need to protect the people he loves. Wood doesn't appear for much of the movie, but does an exceptional job when he does; his wide range is evident through the movie, whether he's cooing at his baby son or snarling as he guns down the thugs. Dawson doesn't really have a chance to do much, but is quite good with the confusion her character feels.Burns' sharp-edged flick about choices and loyalty goes a bit deeper than your average revenge flick. Though flawed by an uneven pace and simple story, &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is well-acted and very compelling. Certainly worth a watch.",Ash Wednesday

535915,"This is not a suspense-drama like ""Silence of the Lambs;"" it's a horror movie.  As a horror flick, ""Hannibal"" wins the 4 stars.  That this sequel fails to retain the genre of the original film is ""disappointment #1.""Losing credibility as a drama makes ""Hannibal"" susceptible to the humor that we attach to the ""horror"" genre.  It had me rooting for the monster.  This led to ""disappointment #2:""  The monster let me down by letting the heroine tame him.Anthony Hopkins and the other actors captured their characters convincingly.  The cast showcased REAL TALENT in the face of a plot that lost contact with reality.  An impossible plot is on par for the horror genre, but a sold-out monster is not.I saw ""Hannibal"" on TV, so I was spared the truckloads of pulpy gore that it reputedly dumps on moviegoers.  Would I watch it uncut (pun!)?  Yeah, but with reservations.In keeping with the ""horror"" genre, the final scene would have been better served (pun again) if a ""flying knives"" Oriental chef-style ending had dispatched the heroine.  Instead we get a pussy-whipped monster.Parting shot:  ""Am I on a roll or what?"" could have been asked by an FBI agent in the movie.

810250,"i've been an Alamo fan all my life, so i was stoked to hear a new alamo movie was being brought to the big screen.first time i saw it, i have to admit i had mixed feelings. on a 10 point scale, i gave it about a 7.5, but after seeing it a second and even a third, i give it a 10 and two very enthusiastic thumbs up.this is the first alamo movie to actually portray the big three in a more true to life fashision. for once, Travis, Crockett, and Bowie seemed more life like and more humane and you got the sense that these were real people living in extraordinary times.Billy Bob Thorton should get every award possible for his portrayal as Davy Crockett. He seems caught in the middle between living up to his name and just being himself and for once, he seems human. you finally get the sense that Crockett came to Texas more for political reasons than to fight in the Alamo. and not that it diminishes his legend one bit, but it puts everything into perspective.Travis can't seem to step out of the shadow of Jim Bowie and Bowie is haunted over the loss of his house and his wife. I thought Hancock did a good job of also showing the cruelty and yet the sense of humanity on the Mexican side at the same time never losing track of the real story, the fight between two sides who fought for what they truly believed in.there are also some real moving parts in the film which include the Travis speech to the men in the Alamo, Crockett's last stand and his execution, but the movie moment for me is the Harmony scene with Crockett playing the fiddle to the Deguello.it's a real tear jerker scene.only major problem i had with the movie was the whole San Jacinto episode. the movie at that part felt like Pearl Harbor, when a whole other hour and new battle was added to the movie.i think for the most part the whole San Jacinto part could have been left out. like somebody once said, once the monster dies, the movie is over.overall, i gave The Alamo a 10. it's a GREAT movie and has some real touching, moving, tear jerker scenes. the characters portrayed are about as true to life as you can get, and watching Billy Bob in the bucksin uniform and the hat really opened your eyes.i can promise to you that for a moment, i saw the real Davy Crockett on the big screen.",N/A

675017,"When this set came out we decided that we had to have it as our previous versions were on VHS.  The bonus with this set of four is the fourth disk with all the wonderful extra features.  If you enjoy learning how movies are made the fourth disk, while long, is a great companion to the three movies themselves.&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; introduced us to digital dinosaurs, and how fearsome they could be with modern computer technology.  This movie advanced horror and monsters movie in a method similar to the way &quot;Alien&quot; advanced movies.  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; immediately became an audience favorite and the new standard by which special effects would be judged.  Stephen Spielberg effectively combined in-your-face terror with special effects to keep people at the edge of their seats and in awe of the life-like creatures.&quot;The Lost World&quot; unfortunately did not measure up to &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;  Many of the characters were unbelievable and there were too many plot holes that were too readily visible to make the movie enjoyable from beginning to end.  While there were several parts of the movie that were well-done, there were at least as many parts where the actions of the characters was unrealistic when considering how people in their positions would normally behave.  The bumps in actions of the characters just did not allow me to focus on the plot throughout.  Another problem with this movie is that it focused too much on action, and very little on the characters themselves.  Thus, the movie comes across as more of a cartoon than a horror movie.&quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; simplified the plot, added new dinosaurs, and allowed the characters to develop more than &quot;The Lost World.&quot;  The short length of the movie forced the movie to be more simple than the previous movie, and that simplicity makes for a good movie.  The best new dinosaur in this movie had to be the pteranodons, though the spinosaur was great also.  The characters in this movie generally acted as I would expect them to, and there were fewer outright acts of stupidity.  Even the theft of a raptor egg was done in ignorance.  So while it was a convenient plot device, you would expect something like that by someone with only minimal knowledge of dinosaurs.  I was very happy to see Sam Neill returning in the role of Dr. Alan Grant.  His character particularly is very believable.If you have yet to buy all these movies, and you thought they were all at least good, if not great, this set is an excellent addition to a home video library.",N/A
786470,"""Cabin Fever"" attempts to pay homage to the classics in a genre that has been collecting dust since the 80's, and succeeds in delivering a few jolts in the process. The story is well conceived, though the direction and especially the writing fails to make this movie stand out as anything other than a campy party movie that will gross out the more squeamish viewers. Read on, if you're interested...The story begins like so many ""Friday the 13th"" movies have, with 5 college students decide to head up into the woods to celebrate the end of their finals by spending a week at a secluded cabin. The 5 kids are right out of the horror-clich&eacute; handbook: The horny couple, the token stoner/misfit, and the painfully nice guy who wants nothing more than to get into a relationship with his frosty-box platonic girl friend. Before heading to the cabin, they are given the ominous warning to ""Stay out of the woods"", and as you might expect, they don't listen. One night they are paid a visit by a seriously sick and demented hermit, who appears to be carrying some sort of disease. The hermit dies in the lake, and infects their water supply, which spreads a parasite that causes the body to melt and break apart in the most gruesome fashion. What happens next is better seen than described, but gore-hounds will definitely be pleased.The cast and crew are composed mainly of unknowns. Director Eli Roth is obviously on his first feature, and pulling out all the stops (assuming he might never get the chance again). Even by horror standards, the script is bad, making the characters as one-dimensional as possible. The one-liners, f-words, and obligatory sexual innuendos are a staple of the genre, and are given in mass quantity here, making the movie unintentionally funny at times. The acting is as inept as can be expected, though Cerena Vincent (best remembered as the perma-nude exchange student from ""Not Another Teen Movie"") stands out, and her scenes do not disappoint. The special effects are the payoff, however, with skin bubbling and melting, blood spewing, and plenty of gruesome dismemberments. The effects are very Tom Savini-inspired, and are very well done.The DVD contains five commentaries (!), which is hefty considering that the movie hardly warrants a second viewing, let alone five. I haven't touched them, but the ""Beneath The Skin"" documentary (30 minutes) is fun to watch, consisting of interviews with the main cast and crew, while splicing in behind the scenes shots, including many of the effects pieces. What makes is fun is that nobody involved seems to take the movie too seriously, and obviously approached it as more of a fun project. The other extras are jokes, consisting of the 1 minute ""Family Version"", the movie shot in ""Chick Vision"", which cuts out all the jump scenes and gore shots for the sensitive girls watching, and the hilarious ""Rotten Fruit"" segments, which further displays Director Roth's obsession with rotting and decaying things. The sheer quantity of extras will keep you busy for almost 10 hours, though you have to wonder if a movie like this warrants that investment in time.""Cabin Fever"" is gory and occasionally goofy, which made it a fun movie to watch the first time around, but with the shock value worn off, it is hard to find a reason to watch it again. It is average in every sense of the word, and is not likely to stand up to other time-honored horror classics. My recommendation is marginal.",Cabin Fever

789876,"Firstly to address the reviewer below. Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat is way more racist then any of the cartoons on the Warner Bros. Censored 11 list including Coal Black. Coal Black actully did what a lot of films did NOT do back then and actully acknowledged the blacks contribution to WWII, while Scrub Me Mama just shows them to be awfully lazy. As for Inki And The Minah Bird, this is one of Chuck Jones best cartoons and the all the gags in the film have nothing to do with Inki's ethnicity even if characiture is offensive.Those are still instresting to see along with Betty Boop, Walt Disney's Alice Cartoons and Scrap Happy Daffy but there are a few cartoons on there which are very boring.

(There probably are many more) This movie probably wouldn't have caught my eye before, except I got it for dead cheap - ?1.20. Plus, it's got two discs to watch - albeit, not terrific extras, but still, cheap is cheap!As well as Ben & Gwyn, this has a great supporting cast, well, apart from Alex D. Linz, who is as big a brat in this as he is in Home Alone 22. The rest of the supporting cast are great: a strange looking Jennifer Grey, Joe Morton, the 'bad' guy from Ghost, and probably many other faces that I don't recognise, but you will. I felt Jennifer Grey's role kinda got pushed to one side, even though it was an important storyline.When the film started, it came across as very much a Final Destination storyline. With the plane and everything. To be honest, the film kinda dragged in the scenes between the plane crashing, and Ben meeting Gwyn. (By the way, who calls their child BUDDY?!)As with all rom-coms, this was very predictable - it just took a while for Benny to get round to telling Gwynnie that he knew her now deceased hubby. You keep rooting for him to tell her, knowing exactly what her reaction was gonna be.I didn't think Ben & Gwyn were exactly miscast in this movie - but it didn't last between them. And how BAD was her wig/hair extentions at times? I thought my hair was bad for looking like a birds nest half the time - I've now seen the light.The DVD has your usual batch of extras here: commentary, making-of, deleted Footage with commentary, gag reel (normally, the only worthwhile one for me to watch), &quot;Need to Be Next to You&quot; music video, featurette: Ben and Gwyneth Go Behind the Scenes, and additional scene-specific commentary with director Don Roos and actors Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Alex....Ive never been too fond of...seems too arrogant for me. Anyway, the other guys in the group seem more at ease and seem to be having the time of their lives on this video. Neil in general sounds and looks like hes at the top of his talent in this video. He does some scary drum parts, especially the solo. The solo actually made me want to add some electric drums to my setup and Im strictly against them. Then theres the crowd...damn do these guys get into it.

The episodes are absolutely hysterical, and the public loved it: it ran for six years with high ratings. I believe the key to it's success is the clever writing. Also crucial is the fact that Eddie Albert's character is the only sane person in the whole town of Hooterville, yet HE IS THE ODDBALL, because everyone else is WEIRD! A lot of the humor is surreal: a pig that watches TV, chickens lay square eggs, an impossibly incompetent county agent, the phone company installs their phone on the top of a pole, etc. Lots of sight gags appear.

783956,"When an obsessive-compulsive pessimistic file clerk decides to create comic books on his life a rhetorical question arises, will someone ever read these comic books?  The film American Splendor is evidence that a group of devoted readers did read this comic book with the same name as the film.  The cult figure Robert Crumb, who is known for Felix the Cat, illustrated Pekar's stories, which at the time only had stick figures and no public interest.  Together Pekar and Crumb brought Pekar's life into the world of comics as an anti-heroic comic book, which essentially uses ordinary people around Pekar that emphasizes their unique talents in a superhuman manner.The film depicts a semi-documentary, which brings humor, drama, tragedy, and whatever else life has to offer to the silver screen through the personification of Harvey Pekar.  A combination between Paul Giamatti, who does a brilliant job performing as Pekar, and Harvey, himself, who frequently presents himself adds texture to the story.  This double performance enhances the story as it brings a dual image of Harvey, the personal depiction, as well as an outsider's perspective of Harvey's identity.  Intriguingly it brings out several layers Pekar's life and his idiosyncrasies as he struggles with testicular cancer, divorce, loneliness, and his hobbies.The films ordinarily depiction of an odd character is unique as it develops into an interesting character study of a real character.  It is sad.  It is funny.  It is depressing.  It is warm.  It is touching.  It is grotesque.  However, life is all these things, and this is Harvey Pekar's life.  Through the pessimistic Pekar the audience gets to be subjected to a wonderful cinematic experience that offers several thoughtful and humorous life lessons.",American Splendor

154082,"In 1987 ROBOCOP was something of a problematic film. The studio had commissioned the European art house director, Paul Verhoeven, to direct an action-packed sci-fi in B-Movie tradition only he ended up giving them something that was more than a few years ahead of its time and something which the film censors would certainly take apart piece by piece. Knowing that they had a great unplayable film the studio was left with a decision - how much they should cut and what they should cut in order to get it a rating. Thus a number of versions of the film were cut - The Original Director's Cut, a cut R-rated version for the US, another less violent R-rated cut version for abroad and a special cut without any violence and bad language for afternoon kid's viewing.In the cinemas we watched the cut R-rated version. So we have never really seen the FULL unedited version of Robocop... until now. When a film censor cuts a film, they can actually imply certain things, instead of showing them, which can change the tone of a scene considerably. For some reason the uncut version is a lot funnier than the cut version. This is because the uncut version usually has some extended violent scenes that almost look comical. When reduced, they look at bit harder. For this reason the more sinister version of Robocop seems to be the cut version and the bloodier more violent uncut version a little lighter but certainly bloodier.... got that?The two versions on this disc are the (1) The uncut, originally unrated, now the new R-rated version of the Director's Cut and (2) The original cut R-rated version. Let's talk about the cuts.When ED-209 goes on the rampage, killing a businessman during a meeting, the scene is extended to show the young exec being hit several more times while lying on top of the Delta City model. Although this scene is certainly a lot bloodier, with body parts flying everywhere and visible holes appearing in the body, it is more funny than shocking.When Murphy and Lewis are chasing the gang in the van there is an extended scene of the shootout involving a villain's leg being shot to pieces in close-up.However the real cream of the crop is getting to see Rob Bottin's (special effects guru on The Thing) uncut version of Murphy's murder. The hand blasting scene is extended to show Murphy holding his stump out for longer with more blood squirting out. There is a scene then of the remainder of his arm being shot off. These extended sequences are quite violent. However the piece we all want to see is the infamous realistic head shot that Bottin masterfully created, but was cut from all the released editions of the film. Bottin built a full version of Murphy from the waste up for this scene. You can see Murphy's face contorted, screaming and the camera pans and you see a hole being blown in the back of his head.... all in one take. This was 1987 remember folks and that effect is as good as anything you will see today! Claps all round to Bottin ... nearly 15 years too late.The final scene is extended to give the bad guy a more violent death as he staggers around the place with two meter arterial spray for a few seconds more.Anyway the bottom line is to get this version to see Bottin's effects in all their glory without being cut. It is all A++ SFX work.",N/A
667627,"This fourth season of THE X-FILES is actually a lot better than I had remembered. Some of the standalone episodes this season are admittedly rather lackluster compared to the best of the previous three seasons, but when the show was at its best during Season 4, it could be either quite powerful or, in the case of ""Small Potatoes"", quite funny.First, the mytharcs. As far as the central mythology is concerned, things take a darker turn than before when Scully discovers she has an inoperable cancer midway through the season, which leads to the emotional highlight episode of the season, ""Memento Mori"". Scully's final speech, in which she resolves not to let the cancer beat her, is as moving as Mulder's tearful breakdown towards the end of Season 2's ""One Breath"".Meanwhile, we have the two-part mytharcs, ""Tunguska""/""Terma"" and ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"". Of the two, the latter is, I think, slightly better: more intense, more gripping, more moving. But ""Tunguska""/""Terma"" is still a pretty good adventure tale, bringing Mulder and his hated enemy Krycek to Russia in search of the so-called ""black cancer"". That said, I always found the black oil piece of the X-FILES mythological puzzle to be kind of a silly one, and its extension here to include suggestions of a Cold War-type race to find a cure for the black oil disease is only slightly less laughable. At least ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"" deals with more believably sinister phenomena: a tragic airplane crash that may have been the result of our government shooting down a UFO and then trying to cover it up. Harrowing, immensely suspenseful stuff indeed.The opening episode ""Herrenvolk""---a continuation of last season's ""Talitha Cumi""---introduces to the mythology the killer bees, and later, in ""Zero Sum"", we learn that the bees may be carrying smallpox, and that the Consortium may be using it to carry out tests on unsuspecting humans (what is being tested is never made clear). ""Zero Sum"" also plays with our ambivalent feelings toward the character of Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), whose loyalties have always been rather foggy: he seems to have great respect for Mulder and Scully, yet here still seems to interact with the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) on occasion for God-knows-what.As I said before, the standalone episodes of this season are hit-or-miss. Some are simply dull, like ""Teliko"" and ""Unrequited""; others are much too heavy-handed about social issues, like ""El Mundo Gira"" and ""Kaddish""; and some others rise above its unpromising paranormal phenomena, like ""Never Again"", which involves a silly talking tattoo (voiced by Jodie Foster!) and yet turns into one of the more revealing X-FILES episodes regarding Dana Scully. There are still some magnificent standalones to be found in Season 4, though: the disturbing ""Home"" (so disturbing that it was banned from television for many years after its initial broadcast), ""Unruhe"", ""Paper Hearts"", ""Leonard Betts"", the wonderfully funny satire of ""Small Potatoes"" (with Vince Gilligan following skillfully in the footsteps of Darin Morgan, who guest stars in the episode), and ""Demons"". As ever, these standalone episodes rise above the rest in exploring the characters of Mulder and Scully in depth, and, in the case of Mulder in ""Demons"", bringing him to the edge of madness. That said, I didn't find ""The Field Where I Died"", in which Mulder discovers he may have had a past life, nearly as powerful as a lot of people said it was: it seemed way too sentimental and overblown to me. And ""Musings of a Cigarette-Smoking Man"", which purports to divulge some secrets about the reprehensible CSM, turns out to be a disappointment, making him more mysterious than ever by the end, even if we do feel a bit more sympathy for the way his life has turned out than before. Still, even by its fourth season, THE X-FILES still had a knack for turning in some good standalone mysteries, and these fourth-season episodes have the added distinction of being more personal than most.And finally we come to the finale of Season 4, ""Gethsemane"". Though hardly a bad episode---it ended the season on a reasonably gripping note---I feel that it is with this episode that the mythology began to go off the rails and turn into the kind of overblown sci-fi soap opera that many people remember the X-FILES mythology to be. Were we really supposed to wholeheartedly believe that everything Mulder had seen in the previous seasons had ALL been a big engineered government lie? Everything??? Even that fearsome Alien Bounty Hunter spouting the toxic green blood---all calculated to fool Mulder into believing in the existence of alien life? I don't think I was the only X-FILES fan to find that a bit too incredible. It was by Season 5 that it became clear that Chris Carter was basically making the mythology up as he went along, and it led to a really big mess of loose ends by the show's final season, where the mythology had begun to feel overstretched and the standalone episodes were the only glories of the show left.Still, that is a fault that would afflict later seasons. On its own, Season 4 is still a remarkable achievement, daring to go darker and deeper into the characters of Mulder and Scully more than any other season before it. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are still as wonderful as ever here, Anderson especially continuing to impress with her brand of intensity and strength. The standalone episodes are variable, but there are still some great mysteries to be found among this season's 24 episodes. This may not be THE X-FILES' best season, but it is perhaps the most emotional season of the show yet. Recommended.",N/A

841280,"Having purchased the region 2 dvd of Shaun Of The Dead from Amazon.co.uk last week and watching the film last night (9/10/04), I can honestly say that this film should find some cult status in the US. Horror fans will like it as well as comedy fans. It may divide some people who can't deal with humor & gore in the same film, but that's their loss. Being a HUGE fan of the British series Spaced (also directed by Edgar Wright and written/starring Simon Pegg), I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it a second time today and it's still entertaining. Simon Pegg is on the verge of breaking out in the US and Edgar Wright is an amazing talent for such a young director. His filming style is flawless and this movie is a nice start to what I hope is a lucrative career for everyone involved. See this movie in theaters September 24th!",Shaun of the Dead

The cast is first rate, Tom Berenger and William Hurt particular highlights and the throwback to 1960's nostalgia is irresistable.One complaint on the DVD though!  Why not release those scenes depicting the characters way back when and finally getting to see Costner?  According to Kasdan himself, that would be damaging because his character, Alex, should remain faceless so the audience can imagine him anyway they want.  Guess what, we all know it's Costner who played him so we already are imagining him as Alex everytime he is mentioned.",N/A

Given the disposition of the characters, one wonders why the writers even bothered to set this story in a medieval setting: it could have been 20th century New York City and it wouldn't have made any difference. Connery, Gere, and Ormond all deliver boring ""stick to the script"" performances with no emotion.This movie isn't even worth renting or having as a gift.

43100,"The praises of this series have been sung by others, and I heartily recommend this DVD to everyone, but I would like to make a few points, some of which are negative, but which don't detract from the immense value of this series.(1) Without the development of the giant Saturn V Moon rocket, man never would have gotten to the Moon, and yet its development, unlike that of the Command Module and Lunar Module is not dealt with and yet its story was just as dramatic.  The problem of ""combustion instability"" and its solution is very interesting and took the lives of some excellent engineers but it is not mentioned.  It is interesting that Wernher von Braun, the head of this effort is barely mentioned or shown in the series, whereas he was a very visible P.R. man for the space program in the 1950's and 1960's.  I believe the producers of this series were aware of von Braun's past as a Captain in the dreaded Nazi SS and his possible (not proven) role in the war crimes involved in the production of the V-2 rocket in World War II and they didn't want to bring up this controversy.(2)  I give great credit to the producers for the episode about the development of the Lunar Module and the other episode showing how the astronauts were trained to become proficient geologists on the Moon.  Science and engineering are usually not interesting for the television viewer, and yet these things were made quite interesting.  My only complaint is that the engineerswho worked on the Lunar Module are shown to be a bunch of lovable ""nerds"" who view the work as recreation, but in reality many engineers gave their lives as heroes, just as did the Apollo 1 astronauts, because of the immense stress due to the time pressure.  Others survived but had the marriages and family lives ruined.  None of this is really shown.(3)  The actors who played Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first two men on the moon, played by Tony Goldwyn and Bryan Cranston, put in especially superb performances.  Aldrin, the troubled genius, was especially well portrayed by Cranston who put in a lot of time studying Aldrin before filming commenced.(4)  The episode about Alan Shepard and Apollo 14 was quite good in showing how the flight controllers and the support teams led by Don Eyles overcame the Abort Switch malfunction.  Here real-time problem-solving was shown.  I was, however, disappointed that the Apollo 16 mission was not really shown because they had a more serious problem with the back-up Service Propulsion System whichalso had a problem and was quite solved in a similar way.  The Apollo 16 crew's exploration of the Descartes-Cayley site would have been quite interesting too because it was quite different than expected.(5)  The episode about the end of the program in Apollo 17 was both good and bad, the bad part being the story that Tom Hanks appears in about the filming of the early 20-th century movie about a flight to the Moon.  This was just a waste of time, in addition to the slander against Thomas Edison. There were more important things to show, in my opinion.  However, the end of the episode leaves me with tears in my eyes, because of all that had been accomplished in such a short time, and was then allowed to be thrown away because of short-sightedness.  I hope that the Presidents recent decision to go back to the Moon will be carried out because Mankind needs to look to the future and to continually expand his horizons.",From the Earth to the Moon
388915,"I'm very picky and selective about what I like when it comes to period dramas, and I usually got for the late 19th c. or early 1900s stuff rather than the 1840s Jane Austen stuff. But I must admit I was deeply captivated by this mini-series, it succeeded with me where others may have failed. The witty, cultured dialogue was very enjoyable to listen to, yet accessible. I understood everything. I loved the story, especially the relationship between the pretty and likeable Elizabeth and the handsome, proud Mr. Darcy kept me guessing all the time if his good qualities would shine through after he started falling for her and if she would soften up to him or not as I was hoping they would end up together after all.

311288,"As a testimony to the events at Altamont in the waning months of 1969, this film is first rate.  However, if one is looking for a &quot;concert film&quot; of the Stones then one will be sorely disappointed, as this was undeniably their worst performance.The concert was doomed from the start, as San Francisco seemed reluctant to provide the Stones with a venue for their free concert.  I think many people thought this was little more than an attempt to upstage Woodstock, a cheap form of self-promotion.  It came at the end of their American tour, and for me seemed to be a fitting farewell.  The film does a remarkable job of following the Stones on their date with tragedy.Of course the single most stupid move was having the Hell's Angels act as security for the concert.  Knowing their reputation, I would think this would have served as ample warning but it seems the Stones, like others, thought the idea of involving the Angels would add to the psychedelic experience. &quot;Big mistake,&quot; Sonny Barger said afterward as some unruly kids messed with their bikes.The film focuses on the chaos that ensued.  One gets little feeling of the size of the crowd except for a few aerial views of the estimated 300,000 people.  The action occurred around the stage, which was too low and constantly had to be cleared.  The Angels dominated the stage, surrounding the performers which ranged from The Flying Burrito Brothers to Jefferson Airplane, like a phalanx.  The concert had to be stopped many times as the Angels beat back the crowd, fueling the disgust and anger that developed, reaching crisis point when the Stones finally took stage in the early evening hours.  Mick seemed honestly confused by what was going on.  It was completely out of his control as his feeble efforts at crowd control fell on deaf ears.  It was during &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; that the fatal stabbing took place, and the film captures that chilling moment, leaving one to doubt that the black man in the green suit had a gun, which the Angels claim he did.The Stones look back over the concert tour in the editing room, offering a few candid comments on what took place.  The concert earned them their infamous place in rock and roll history.  The film offers only fleeting glimpses of the other performers that shared the stage with the Stones.  The Dead was on hand as well, but all one sees of them is a short take of Garcia and Weir and Kreutzmann (I believe) back stage commenting on the violence taking place. This was a bad trip.",N/A
789208,"I actually enjoyed King Solomon's Mines. Sure it was bad, but the funny sense of humor was a treat and the action was non-stop. The sequel Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of Gold lacks all this. It tries to capture the same humor as the first film but fails. Also the action is rather dull and unspactacular. I believe part of the problem was the low budget. King Solomon's Mines had a way bigger budget so they could afford the fun action scenes. Here there's not much budget to go around so the action was cut short. Overall a dismal sequel that is totally pointless.",N/A

736685,"WOW! This was a pretty decent romantic comedy. We had this in our collection for months (Possibly years) and never watched it. We decided to watch this film on a whim. I have to say that it was better and ever funnier than I thought it would be.Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry Thomas, and he is great at as well.I won't go into the plot here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres (Sweet Home Alabama & 13 Going on 30) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention.The other thing that must be said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is. She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre.

789340,"This is about what you would expect from the &quot;thriller&quot; formula.  There is the family who moves to the country to get away from the hustle-bustle and the crime, there is the run-down old house they wish to turn into their dream home, and then comes along an ex-con drifter-type who used to live there.  All the ingredients for a predictable film.  Everything you could think of that could happen, does.  There is a house full of snakes, the family pet is slain, and the bad guy falls to his death through a beautiful stained-glass window.  I really didn't give the ending away, because early in the film the children are looking around the house (tresspassing, actually) when we see them open a window and look around a central shaft of the house and on the ground floor ceiling there is the multi-colored, stained-glass window.  Did the filmmakers actually think the audience was going to forget such an obvious scene?  There is also the dark and stormy night by film's end, complete with a battle on the roof.  One of my favorite scenes was when Dennis Quaid is alone in the house and he hears sombody walking toward him and there is a single low note played on the piano for the score.  Doom!  I chuckled heartily at the feeble attempt at making me scared.  Back to the rooftop.  There is the predictable scene when the killer has to give his monologue so that either help can arrive or the victim's-to-be figure out a way to thwart the dastardly dude.  When the couple are being chased through the house, lightning flashing through the windows, Sharon Stone is supposed to look terrified, but instead I thought she needed to use the bathroom. She should try the pink stuff.  She seriously overacts in more than one scene.  Dennis Quaid is passable, but only just.  The only actor worth his salt here is Stephen Dorff.  He does a subtle yet persuasive job given that his character's agenda is so predictable.  Overall, this film is pretty lame stuff.  So far this film is averaging 2 stars and the distributors are trying to sell over 130 copies at this site alone.  That should be warning enough to avoid this film.  I actually laughed more than I jumped; or I was shaking my head and looking away with a deep sigh.  This is a fine cast wasted on a generic film.",N/A

Meanwhile, Jaime is participating in a Halloween pageant at the hospital when she gets the feeling that Michael is now after Tina, who is living it up at a high school Halloween party. Tina ends up sacrificing herself to save the little girl, but the chase doesn't end there. Dr. Loomis wants to get Michael home, hoping that will tame some of his rage against his family.

829930,"This 2003 Iranian film has a lot of depth.  The main character is a man named Hussein. Bloated with extra weight because of a medical condition he developed while fighting in the Iraq war, he now works as a pizza deliveryman.Through his eyes, we get a view of Iranian society.  For example, we see him delivering pizzas to a place that is having a party where young people are dancing.  However, he's detained by the police who are arresting the partygoers as they emerge from the party because such behavior is forbidden in Iran.  He's just a bystander with pizzas which will not be eaten and so he offers pizza to police and arrestees alike.  It's a very moving scene and we even get a glimpse of a 15-year old soldier who is trying to follow the rules and not eat on duty but really does want a piece of pizza.Then there is a scene where he meets his former army commander who's embarrassed by the fact that Hussein, a war hero, is now delivering pizza and so he gives him a large tip.Our hearts go out to this oversized man who is constantly reminded of the vast differences in Iranian society.  In another scene a rich man invites him in to his very expensive apartment just because he needs to talk to someone.  Hussein wanders around here with a sense of wonder at all the riches and it soon becomes clear that Hussein's desperation is growing.Soon, we understand the act of violence with which the film opens and which confused me at first.  But the rest of the film answers those questions.This is a fine film although a bit confusing and somehow sad.  But it's well done and meaningful.  Not for everyone but film buffs will love it.

I am too young to know him. So I basically went to see this film for the couriosity of seeing the all-star cameros, especially Sheryl Crow. The life of Porter was provocative because he was bisexual,and it kind of ruinned his career and relationships. Nothing about the story touched me, except for Ashley Judd's breakthrough performance as an unconditional loving wife. She has never been so good, considered her character aged from 30-60 years old, and died from illness. The moment when she was getting made over in her room by herself, and she suddenly broke down into massive tears, because she realized that she had never been loved whole-heartedly by her husband. That was the scene to remember! I hope she will at least get nominated for an Oscar, because she made me forget about all of her action thrillers in this movie. Kevin Klein was very good, and it's not the first time he played a flaming homo. In and Out was the last time he gone ""pink"". He's character was too selfish and sexually permiscuious for me to like. I preferred him in Life as A House a lot more.

It made a big impression on me then, and makes a big one now that I have finally seen it again, with all the knowledge of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan that I've acquired over the years. The set design and costumes are wonderful, and the English seaside setting is clever if not particularly meaningful in and of itself. The video effects are fairly ham-handed, but don't detract from the stage show which is, in a word, delightful. This is quite simply the most hilariously funny &quot;Mikado&quot; available on video. Richard Angas in the title role lends the Mikado a certain sinister seediness (and his costume is amazing). Eric Idle does a great Ko-Ko, putting his patent insincerity to good use, and putting to rest any quibbles about stunt casting. The rest of the cast and chorus are equally outstanding. Most notably, Felicity Palmer's Katisha and Richard van Allen's Pooh-Bah are as close to definitive as I can imagine (both later reprised the roles on the delightful Mackerras recording). Ms. Palmer deserves special mention, as she milks Katisha for all the humor and pathos she's worth, while delivering the demanding vocal passages in a ringing mezzo voice. It's a shame there's not a traditional Japanese-dress &quot;Mikado&quot; on par with this one, but I have no difficulty in saying that for casual viewers and Savoyards alike, this should be at the top of everyone's &quot;little list.&quot;",N/A
286440,"While not a cinematic masterpiece, ""The Vikings"" does the job.  My only problem is, in typical 50's fashion, it woefully over-simplifies things (""Vikings are simple, happy people who churn beer and flirt with their serving wenches!"") but whatever... it's still fun.  Surprisingly, I first saw this movie when I was about twelve and it's actually a pretty good educational tool -- I learned a little bit about Norse gods (how can you not when they mention ""Odin"" every five minutes), what ""Valhalla"" is, and even a bit about the Vikings and their raiding techniques.The plot: Early in the movie, we see the Vikings pillage an English town (as the Vikings often did, along the English coast).  Their chief, Ragnar, rapes the English queen and impregnates her.  Since the baby (a boy) is illegitimate, the queen hands him over to a monk who will raise the child.  Years later, we catch up with the son (Tony Curtis) who is now a full-grown man.  He was indeed raised by monks but was recently captured while at sea and sold into slavery.  Now, he is a slave of the Vikings.  Erik is noble and proud.  Einar (Kirk Douglas) is the spoiled, arrogant (yet somewhat likeable) son of the Viking chieftain, Ragnar.  Erik and Einar are similar in age and their personalities clash.This group of Vikings soon kidnaps a Welsh princess (Vivian Leigh) in order to ransom her.  However, Einar, having his pick of Viking wenches, is intrigued by princess Morgana's rejection of his advances, not to mention her stunning beauty.  Simultaneously, Eric also falls for her, and she for him, despite their ""class"" differences.HOWEVER, this wouldn't be a fun 50's time-piece without a dramatic twist!  Remember that Eric is no mere slave, he is a prince and, even better, does not know it! (The necklace he wears, given to him by his mother, proves it.)

884441,"A film by Mike Nichols""Closer"" is a film about beginnings and endings.  We are given a look into how relationships begin, and how they end.  Very little of what happens in between is ever seen on screen.  Because of this, there are time gaps in the story of up to a year, but after the first gap and you figure out just what the structure is, it is barely noticeable.  ""Closer"" begins (appropriately enough) with the meeting of Alice (Natalie Portman) and Dan (Jude Law).  Alice is walking down a London sidewalk.  Dan is following her, observing.  It isn't clear if he is stalking her, or just admiring her beauty.  When Alice looks the wrong way when crossing the road, she is American, she is struck by a car.  Dan is right there to get her help and this begins a flirtation and their relationship.Dan meets Alice.  Dan meets Anna.  Anna meets Larry.  Dan leaves Alice.  Anna leaves Larry.  Larry meets Alice.  To call ""Closer"" a romantic triangle would be to do the film a disservice, not to mention that there are four people involved in this ""triangle"".  The romantic pairings up and hooking up is the method these characters use to try to fulfill something that is lacking in their lives.  But the real point here is the conversation that comes about because of it.  The conversation that happens at the beginning and the ending of a relationship is the most interesting, and the most intense because the emotions are heightened and more focused, both with joy and with pain.  The dialogue is sharp, incredibly intelligent (I've never come across conversation like this before in my life), it feels realistic, flirtatious, and very sexual.  In particular, the dialogue at the endings of relationships is quite graphic.""Closer"" is all about character and humanity, and not so much about giving a traditional plot.  The four main actors here do a fantastic job in ""Closer"" and collectively give the performance of the year.  Natalie Portman is likely going to pick up a Best Supporting Actress Nomination (if not win) for her portrayal of Alice, the all grown up but still somewhat childish waif of a stripper.  Clive Owen, however, steals the show (as does Portman) with every scene he is in.  He is passionate, intense, and perfect.  As is, I would suggest, this movie.  It is not an upbeat movie, but it has such a warmth to it even as the characters are all treating each other really badly.  This is a very impressive movie and one which I sincerely hope gets a Best Picture nomination come Oscar time.-Joe Sherry",N/A

If the writers had thought about the story for a few minutes more they could have come up with a climax that made Schwarzenegger the hero-savior but wasn't as unbelievably (if still gratuitously) vicious.  But I guess that doesn't matter in Schwarzenegger movies.Movies aren't real life, but what kind of people put this stuff out for people to be entertained by?  Best of luck, California.",N/A
839596,"Attention! Spoilers Ahead! I really don't need to express to you how wonderful Little House on the Prairie is, but season 6 is certainly no exception.  If you're fan, why are you reading this? I love this collection and these shows are still good enough to go back to prime time, I'm so bummed out there is no quality stuff like this on the tube anymore.Be that as it may, take care of that issue and go out and buy this now. The box sets of all these DVD's are absolutely fantastic, I love to go back from season to season and see everyone grow and notice the changes in Walnut Grove. This big season Laura falls in love with Almonzo and the most rememembered, however disheartening episode, is when the blind school is burned down and Alice Garvey dies and Mary loses her baby in the fire. I still get shivers and cry during this episode everytime.  I found out that the character ""Alice"" Garvey wanted to give up the role as Alice and start a family--- so no time for acting, so what do they do? They burn her alive! Nice grand exit Alice, anyway, I think the collection is of 12-13 episodes, with some interviews with Alison Engram (Nellie) and the reverend Alden. The picture and sound is fine for the most part, although I noticed some ""audio"" distortions in  some of the episodes, it sounds like the music was coming from the rear end of a cow, but it's only noticeable on a few episodes. Enjoy these episodes now, as the exit of the main characters is coming to a close in upcoming Season 7, make sure you get them all!!!",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 6
413813,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Despite the vile settings and seedy characters there is some odd charm about the film that keeps you coming back for more. The plot revolves around a young man, Mark Renton, and his quest for the true meaning of life admist his drug induced existence. He and his friends trip through life only living for the next shot of H and wondering how to get the money for it. They live in shabby, sparsely decorated flats and live on ratty mattresses and, for the most part, have no goal in life except ultimate pleasure for life. Renton however has more depth and yearning for something more and sets upon a quest to clean up his act and live like those he once denounced. Dark humor and stark realization are constantly presented during the film and thankfully the movie doesnt ever sacrifice one in favor of the other. The soundtrack is also excellent sporting both tried and true rock veterans Iggy Pop and Lou Reed(of the Velvet Underground) as well as modern industrial and techno artists like Primal Scream, New Order and Underworld. This is definitley one of the ""hippest"" films of the 90's and one of the best movies I've ever seen period.",Trainspotting VHS
833962,"I bought this set because i really loved the series. All of the first season episodes are here, but they are completely out of order. Yes, they are in ""airdate"" order, but when i buy a set like this i expect them to correct that and simply put them in order of occurrence. I actually took the time to watch them in the order of ""star date"" (chronologically). I preferred this way due to uniform and personnel changes. This seems like a major oversight by the DVD set's producers.The extras are wonderful--perhaps too much Shatner, but still informative. I wish there was more on DeForrest Kelly, though. The original first episode should have been included (even though they do include the ""Menagerie"" episode, which covers most of it). All in all, not the best set, but i have enjoyed it.",N/A
825996,"I normally don't write reviews for these things, but it seems that many of the other reviews missed something important... but I will get to that later.Romero's Dawn was a classic, and I was not at all sure the remake would be worthwhile, but I was happily surprised.  Ramping up the zombies to a Resident Evil type speed was a stretch for me, but it works in the context of this new story.  Like TCM, this was not just a remake but a rewrite, the only way it could have worked.  This movie was done well enough to keep original Dawn fans happy and bring a new legion of zombie lovers into the fold.  Sure, some of the dialogue was cheese, but its a horror movie for god's sake!  What do you expect?  (And its not like other popular genre's are devoid of cheese.)The characters were well-defined, even if some were merely caricatures of societal elements.  The special effects were top-notch, and the frenzied zombies gave a sense of imminent danger rather than the forboding sense of doom from the original.For all those who complained about the ending... you obviously left the theater too soon.  In recent years, many movies have delighted in putting extras in the credits... in this movie, if you left when the credits began to roll... well, don't make that foolish mistake again.  When it finally came to a close, I felt the perfect bridge into the world given to us in Day of the Dead.Fantastic movie and a must have for any worthwhile collection!",Dawn of the Dead
807377,"Helen Mirren once again returns in her Emmy Award-winning role as Jane Tennison in what is, I believe, the series' most powerful police drama yet. This sixth episode in Prime Suspect, ""The Last Witness,"" has Tennison hunting down the leaders of a paramilitary death squad in London. These men had perpetrated heinous crimes against humanity during the Balkan Civil War and could possibly be the cause of a terrible murder in Jane's jurisdiction.Former Chief Detective Tennison, has now been promoted to overseeing all murder investigations in London. She is, as usual, battling the male establishment and coming to grips with advancing middle-age. At 54 she feels she is being pushed toward early retirement and the pressure and presence of ambitious younger colleagues who would love to have her job are ever present. At this point in her life Jane Tennison is also beginning to realize that her career has become her life - a sad and lonely realization.When the body of a young Bosnian woman turns up, with signs of brutal, sadistic torture, Jane takes over the case. Her investigation leads her to one man, and perhaps two, who are alleged war criminals with much to hide as they attempt to make new lives for themselves in Britain. The murdered woman's older sister is finally found and promised protection in return for her story and assistance with the ongoing investigation. The police protection proves to be weaker than the will of the murderer to eliminate all possible witnesses to his crimes. And disaster strikes again with horrifying results. As usual Tennison risks all in her determination to bring the guilty to justice and in this sixth episode ""all"" could mean her career.The Prime Suspect series has long been a favorite. Helen Mirren is superb as an actress in any role and absolutely shines as Jane Tennison. Ms. Mirren lends the correct mix of tough independence and vulnerability that are such an important part of the character. And her face mirrors all the emotion her character is feeling more eloquently than words. I heard Ms. Mirren say, in a recent interview with the press, that this will be the last Prime Suspect episode. I am very sorry to see it end but can't imagine a more fitting conclusion. Wonderful acting and drama. Highly recommended!JANA",Prime Suspect 6 - The Last Witness
779167,"Fans of the Marx Brothers movies have had to wait a long time to finally see their heroes done justice on the DVD format. Image Entertainment released a now out-of-print box set a few years ago with simply awful transfers and no extras. Hopes were raised when Warner Brothers announced that they would be releasing their own box set this year. The good news is that the Warners discs feature excellent transfers of every movie with a solid collection of supplemental material. The bad news is that many of the Marx Brothers most famous and beloved early films, like The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers are not included set. So what exactly does one get with this new box set?The first film in the set is A Night at the Opera, arguably one of the Marx Brothers best films of their career. It was the first film after they were pushed out of Paramount Studios because of the commercial and critical failure of Duck Soup.Opera was a huge hit and put the Marx Brothers back on the map. They wisely followed it up with another Thalberg collaboration, A Day at the Races.Sadly, Thalberg died suddenly before the movie was completed and the Marx Brothers films would never achieve the same greatness. No longer under the producer's protective presence, the Marx Bros. were effectively at the studio's mercy. They put them out to pasture metaphorically speaking. This may explain why the Marx Bros. made Room Service for RKO instead of MGM in 1938.At the Circus marked the Marx Brothers' return to MGM and is not one of their greatest moments but isn't awful either.Go West begins with a very funny scene in which Chico and Harpo milk Groucho out of most of his money. However, all three eventually appear in the Old West without any logical explanation on how they got there.Touted as their ""first farewell film,"" The Big Store is a bit of a lackluster affair but does have its moments.Upon completion of The Big Store, Harpo planned to retire, Groucho was going to focus on his radio career and Chico was going to form a big band. However, after World War II they reformed to make two more films, one of which rounds out the box set--A Night at Casablanca.As one would expect, the bulk of substantial extras are on the discs for the Marx Brothers' most popular films, A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Each DVD features several short films, some animated, some not and a theatrical trailer for each movie. Here are some of the highlights.The A Night at the Opera DVD features an audio commentary by film historian, Leonard Maltin. He lays it down right from the start that his track will not be a dry, academic analysis of the Marx Brothers' comedy. He delivers an enthusiastic commentary that is also informative.""Remarks on Marx"" is a 33-minute look at the Marx Brothers' legacy. It not only explains where they got their nicknames but also examines their anarchic brand of comedy.A Day at the Races features an audio commentary by Glenn Mitchell, author of The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia. This is a vastly informative track as Mitchell talks at length about the backgrounds of actors Allan Jones and Margaret O'Sullivan.""On Your Marx, Get Set, Go!"" is a look at the film and briefly explores the volatile relationship between the Marx Brothers and the film's director, Sam Wood.The extras on the Room Service disc are pretty slim.Aside from a vintage radio promo for Go West, there is little of relevance to the movie itself in the supplemental section.Fans of the Marx Brothers are in for a real treat with this box set that covers the last eleven years of their careers. The transfers for each film are fantastic and a definite improvement over the Image box set. While the extras tend to get slimmer and less relevant in their later films, the ones for A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races are excellent. The audio commentaries, especially, are a must-listen for any Marx Bros. fan. One hopes that their early output of films will receive the same excellent treatment.",N/A
174909,"I took my 7 year old son to see this movie today, and there was a point in the movie where I had ""that feeling.""  This is a feeling I don't often get watching a movie.  It is hard to describe it, but I know that the next time, and every other time I see that spot in the film, this thrill will return.  The last time I got that thrill was when I saw ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" and I got to the scene at the Bridge at Khazad Dum.  This feeling can only be evoked in me when image, music, story converge into memorable wonder.For me, this was a true Christmas movie.  The spirit of the film was beyond the commercialism that holiday fare has, of late, become, which is ironic since it uses technology at the cutting edge.  Reviews I have read seem to call it a failure because of its creepiness of characters, vagueness, sublime underscore of terror.  I believe it was a success because of these things.  I remember reading an article by Maurice Sendak, author of the ""Wild Things"" books, where he criticized modern children's book writers for forgetting the terror that is part of childhood, the terror that folk stories still remember, but our modern, psychologist-approved TV and books deny or try to sugar over.In this movie, the children are at the edge of danger constantly; critics rebuke the movie for this.  Indeed they are; as young children are.  These are beings who have not yet found that there can be a stability in life because there hasn't been enough of it for them to trust a stability.  They don't have enough experience to understand that you can depend on the tracks to be there.  It is a rollercoaster ride; a tightrope walk.  The lead character is taken back to that uncertain childhood; the skeptic who has begun questioning his beliefs is taken back to this wild terror, and through it finds belief.  Zemekis is smart in that he acknowledges that it is a dream, but he doesn't make a big deal about the line between dream and reality.  Is there really that big a wall between the two?  For a child, a believer, there is not.One of the many amazing scenes in here is when the three leads walk along the rail line, above a bottomless plunge.  And Zemekis is smart enough to make this scene silent: no scary music, no pumped up fear shots.  The kids simply walk the rail, arms out for balance, knowing there is no safety net, yet they do it.  That is childhood too.  They deeply fear the terror of death, but they don't fully understand it either, as we adults do.And yes, the kids have no names.  They are not meant to.  There is a deep allegorical element to this story.  The boy of the mid-20th century who has become a skeptic to magic in life?  The industrial/almost-facist nature of the North Pole factory?  The elf within the camp-like factory who subtly throws in a Yiddish word?  The black female child whose ticket is lost by the white boy and is sent out of the passenger car, whose challenge it is to lead?  I am sure you can find more allegorical examples of the roots of the later 20th century and our loss of wonder and belief.If you go to this movie merely to measure the accuracy of the special effects, you may nitpick details like the lifeless eyes, the miffed body movements, etc., but you will be missing the point of this movie.  For children, the wolves are always howling just outside the window, following the careening train through the ride to adulthood.  Most adults successfully negotiate this ride, and abandon those fears as silly childhood nonsense.  Some of us realize the magic is tied in with that terror, and realize belief is both a spiritual wonder and a breathless terror.",N/A
378864,"When I rented this movie, the cashier commented on how bad this film was and how I was wasting my money. I took his word for it initially but rented it anyway. I would have to agree that this movie overall isn't that great, but in retrospect isn't that bad either. I've seen much worse horror ideas brought to film.Yeah, there's some crappy acting from this movie, mainly from the less important characters. The main players in the story do an alright job acting, making it watchable. But I thought the movie had a creepy surrealistic atmopshere that gave it quality. And I thought the actual Mangler itself pulsed with evil and wretchedness. And some the scenes where people get mangled were gory fun. Yeah, I'll admit the scene with the icebox was a little stupid, but could have been much worse. And I thought they did a very good job in the end when the Mangler started moving and actually coming after people. They did it as originally as possible without making it ridiculous. I don't think anyone else could've pulled off a giant ironing machine coming after people as well as Tobe Hooper did.Random Thought: When I rented this, I didn't know it was based on a Stephen King short story and through the whole film I was thinking how much it reminded me of ""Christine."" Makes sense.Overall, I think this film was a lot better than most people gave it credit for. I think people dismiss horror movies too easily if they don't match up to bull$@#* like the The Ring or crap like that.",Mangler VHS
783331,"In Living Color was probably the best sketch comedy show ever produced on TV. For my money there are more laughs per episode of this show than any other TV show, bar none. These brilliant people hit the ground running with the very first sketch of the very first episode, and didn't let up. The first season only had 13 episodes, but there's so much comedic genius crammed into these three discs that it feels like 26 episode's worth. What amazes me is that only Jim Carrey went on to prominent film success, like many SNLers have. As funny as Jim Carrey is, I don't think he was the funniest performer on this show. Nevertheless, In Living Color ages extremely well over time. It's hard to believe that its first season was in 1990. Recurring characters like Homey D. Clown, Anton the Bum and the Hedleys are simply funny. I'd have time to watch thirteen shows if I only had nine jobs!",N/A
224146,"When CROCODILE DUNDEE was first released in 1986, it made a star out of veteran Australian actor Paul Hogan and the film was the surprise hit of the year.  Now, nearly twenty years later, repeated viewings have not diminshed the charm or the luster of a film that manages to work on so many different levels.  Credit must go to Hogan who wrote the screenplay and knew, as did Stallone for ROCKY, that only he could bring an instant audience identification with the mythical Likable Hero.Hogan is Mick Dundee, a resident of the Australian outback who is discovered by Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), who brings him back to New York to revel in the sin of the big city.  When she does this, Hogan is the Aussie fish out of water, but astoundingly, he blends in nicely regardless of situation or circumstance, while losing none of his infectious charm.  People just seem to like him, and those that do not (Charleton's boyfriend, the pimp, the mugger) he quickly dispatches much to the applause of the audience in the film and the audience watching it.  Director Peter Faiman wisely allows Hogan's irrespressable grin to act as a cinematic lighting rod that attracts a community blessing on everything that Hogan says or does.  Hogan as Mick Dundee permits the audience to vicariously perform feats of Outback and Central Park heroism that only a previous generation's Frank Capra could have pulled off.  One previous reviewer slammed the Hogan-Kozlowski romantic pairing as forced and one-sided.  I don't agree.  Early on, Kozlowski as Charlton shows a potent attraction to Dundee, even in the face of her looming marriage to another man.  As she sees that Dundee is a physically attractive and emotionally appealing hero of towering yet likable stripe, she gravitates toward him in a way that is predictable yet highly satisfying for that.  The closing scene on the subway platform that allows a crowd of passengers to connect the two lovers also serves as a cinematic fulcrum that bridges the gap between passive audience acceptance of romance to active audience participation of that romance.  CROCIDILE DUNDEE is as fine a mythologized hero-heroine film that has ever graced the screen.",N/A
630262,"I just returned from this movie about 20 minutes ago, and I am still in awe over the misuse and abuse of power the US government (Bush n' Co.) has ""enforced.""Some of the images of the innocent Iraqi citizens and everyday people (like you and I) standing in front of demolished homes burying their own children make my skin crawl. Soon-to-be-ex President Bush's ties with the Taliban PRIOR TO Sept. 11 were exposed as a Taliban leader was given a tour of major US government buildings.Another sickening feature of the Bush administration uncovered in this film is the deception of the American people with this ""rainbow"" of security threats. Fahrenheit 9/11 analyzes the truth behind the red, orange, etc. levels of terrorist alert in order to divert attention from the struggles the US was experiencing in Afghanistan. This magician's show of tricking the audience to look one way while doing something sneaky MUST be stopped!This film is a very powerful, moving film that made me question my own beliefs, principles and ideas I had prior to seeing this documentary. Indeed, at times during the movie I was embarrassed to be an American, but perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel in November, so all hope is not lost.

This efficient fitness routine challenges my entire body in a relatively short amount of time, about 45 minutes.

176008,"This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's ""hippie mentality"" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups.

If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she ""loves"" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. Its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place.

618477,"It's hard to knock Richard Curtis: as a writer, he's more-or-less singlehandedly revived the fortunes of the British film industry, comedy or otherwise. That said, his vein of humour - gentle for the most part, with alternating bouts of sentimentality and vulgarity - is an acquired taste.Anyone who found sitting through Notting Hill or Bridget Jones a bit of a struggle might want to pass on Love, Actually. This is Curtis in extremis, from the ""love is all around"" mantra to the bumbling Hugh Grant character, the big musical numbers to the Christmas setting.There are no less than eight stories on offer, running the gamut from schoolboy infatuation to full-on marital infidelity. Some of the plots are a hoot: I defy anyone, for instance, not to enjoy washed-up rocker Billy Mack's (Bill Nighy) quest for Christmas Number One. There are some strong performances, too - Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are particularly good as an estranged married couple.Elsewhere, though, Curtis's preference for quantity over quality gets a bit irritating. The central romance, between Grant's bumbling prime minister and Martine McCutcheon's tea lady, could happily fill a whole movie. The fact that it's given so little screen time here just robs the characters' final declarations of love of any meaning. Curtis may have intended to create a towering monument to the glories of l'amour, but instead he often ends up reducing ""I love you"" to a banal platitude.Still, as an entertaining bit of fluff, this just about succeeds. Fans of Curtis's previous work, and anyone of a diehard romantic bent, will probably find much to enjoy here.",Love Actually
315659,"one another's shortcoming but never takes that long, hard look into the mirror of self-introspection. This adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's play is dry and slow moving. It's a slow building sizzle of failed lives and interactions exploding and unraveling between well intentioned family members. I would compare its dynamics to 'Relfections In A Golden Eye' (Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Julie Harris) in its pace and temperament.Everyone needs to be in analysis. Everyone is love-starved and in need of some attention. Everyone uses the failings of others to avoid the failings of their own lives. So we drown in the drama of people and families, like us, who can't extract themselves from the web of their inability to take control of their lives. We see how ineffectual and pointless we become when we depend upon others to fill in the black holes of our emptiness and sense of helplessness.One has to be in the mood to watch 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' It's demanding and draining. Yet I always find it a fascinating and insightful viewing. The tragedy of the 'American Dream' and its incompatibility with real life is probably the lesson here. We fill our heads with false expectations, then insulate ourselves from our innate needs and responsibility for our own lives, and end up an unnatural and pathetic shadow of what we might have been.I've never seen Olivier's version, so I can't compare one to the other. Each film has those who hail one or the other, sometimes at the expense of the other, as the best version. I'll probably buy it down the road so that I know. I think the film good enough to spend the money on a second version.Like 'Reflections In A Golden Eye,' 'Long Day's Journey Into Night' remains one of my favorite films. I really appreciate the human drama of dealing with our shortcomings and stifled desires. I highly recommend both films, and hope to see ""Reflections' on dvd soon.",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS
734373,"This is Rhino's second DVD collection of four episodes of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" and it's excellent. It has three great episodes from various seasons, and a fourth disc of hilarious short subjects. And it comes in a nifty package with moving parts!In case you're new to the world of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" (MST3K for short, that's what us fans -- ""Misties"" -- call it), this is the famous TV show where a silhouette of a man and two robots in theater seats provide running commentary for some of the worst movies ever made. The ninety-minute episodes are scattered with sketches and songs and amount to some of the smartest, most pop-culture savvy, side-splitting comedy ever made.This DVD contains three episodes, plus a compilation of short subjects from different episodes. The episodes cover a wide spectrum: two are from early in season three, when Joel Hodgson was the host and the show was just kicking into high gear. The third is from late in the sixth season, when the show had developed a much more slick and sarcastic approach with host Mike Nelson. People new to the show will get a good chance to compare the styles of the show. Personally, I love both, but they are quite different. The Shorts are brief films that the host would sometimes make fun of before the movie. Originally, they watched episodes of old movie serials, but when those quickly became tiresome, they turned to educational, commercial, and industrial filmstrips (you know, those annoying things you had to watch at school assemblies in sixth grade?). They contain some of the funniest riffing in the series, and are favorites of the fans.Here's what's on this collection:ANGEL'S REVENGE. Episode #622. A 1978 film originally titled ""Angel's Brigade,"" this is an hysterically awful rip-off of the TV show ""Charlie's Angels,"" only it's worse, if you can imagine that! A group of attractive and not-so-attractive women decide to wage war on L.A.'s drug dealers by dressing in white jump suits. The female leads (including Playboy Playmate Susan Lynn Kiger) are horrendous actresses, but what's really embarrassing is the presence of well-known guest stars slumming at the pits of their careers: Jack Palance, Jim Backus, Pat Butrum, Alan Hale, and in a depressing performance, Peter Lawford. Poor Peter appears to have been drunk for the entire filming. Mike and the `Bots have an absolute field day making fun of the relentless 70s style (""Entertaining was a lot easier in the 70s!"") and the poor, unfortunate guest stars (""Do you think Peter knows where he is?""). This is one of my favorite Mike Nelson episodes, and it's the best disc in this package.CAVE DWELLERS. Episode #301. This film was originally released in 1984 as ""Ator the Invincible"" and then as ""Blade Master"" on video. It's a sequel to ""Ator the Fighting Eagle,"" and is one of many cheap-o copycats of ""Conan the Barbarian."" This stinker stars Miles O'Keefe as beefy warrior Ator, who also knows lots of sciencey stuff (like how to manufacture a hang-glider in two minutes with just sticks). Ator travels to the Ends of the Earth to stop some John Saxon-like villain from obtaining some vague object with a funny name that might do something really bad. Or whatever -- the film is just fantasy of the worst kind. It's so cheap there are no special effects, and the only monster is an immobile velour snake. This is first episode of season three, and this is really when the show entered its golden phase. Joel and the `Bots have some good times here, especially at the outlandish finale, and there's a hilarious parody of the movie's opening credits. A good episode, and the start of great things.POD PEOPLE. Episode #303. The poor dubbing in this film automatically marks it as foreign, but since it's obviously trying to pass itself off American, it's tricky to figure out where it was really shot. Mystery over: this is a 1983 Spanish film called ""Los Nuevos Extraterrestres,"" released in America as ""The Unearthling."" It's an awful attempt to copy ""E.T."" and combine it with a horror film. Aliens that resemble miniature two-legged versions of Snuffleupuggus from ""Sesame Street"" invade the mountains. A high-pitched little kid befriend one of the aliens, Trumpy, while the rest start killing people for no reason. There's an awful pop band on a trip (their performance in a recording studio is one of the highlights of the episode), some poachers, and a dysfunctional family up in a cabin. None of it fits together, but Joel and `Bots create some classic running gags. It's the perfect kind of film for the MST3K treatment. You'll love their re-creation of the incomprehensible ""song"" performed by the band in the move. (""It stinks!"")SHORTS, VOL. 1. These come from many seasons, and all are great. Tom Servo does a joking intro for each one. ""The Home Economics Story"" (from episode #317) is a 1950s film for high school girls that encourages them to study home economics in college, implying that they aren't destined for anything other than being housewives. ""Junior Rodeo Daredevils"" (from episode #407) tells how a group of kids in a tiny town set up their own rodeo, and then broke all their limbs and snapped their spinal chords -- all in good fun! ""Body Care & Grooming"" (from episode #510) informs college students how to spend all their time grooming their hair and skin, because people will only like them if they're pretty! ""Cheating"" (from episode #515) tells the tragic story of Johnny, who cheated and rose to power, and then fell into the pits of despair not unlike a Kafka novel. ""A Date with Your Family"" (from episode #602) is the best of the bunch: a nightmare about the perfect 50s family having a perfectly repressed 50s dinner. The riffing here is as sharp and satiric as anything ever done on the show. ""Why Study Industrial Arts"" (from episode #609) is the reverse of ""The Home Economics Story,"" encouraging young men to risk sawing off their limbs in shop class. And finally, ""The Chicken of Tomorrow"" (from episode #702) explains breeding techniques to create meatier chickens. It's very depressing.(In a bit of a mistake, two of the shorts are already available on other DVDs: episode #609, ""The Skydivers"" is on the first Rhino DVD collection, and Episode #515, ""The Wild World of Batwoman,"" is available as a single DVD, so you might have already seen two of these shorts.)This is another awesome collection from Rhino. There's more laughs here than you'll find in a year's worth of Hollywood comedies.

471774,"George has a really great voice. It is strong and has a lot of varity and colour. However I gave this DVD away as I just didnt like his style of videos. I almost kept it for the one concert clip as I think he is actaully at his best in a concert belting it out and connecting with his fans.The videos are good visual quality and sound but watching one after the other back to back I found I was really put off by the progression of gyrating near-naked woman sexually provocative and pouting at the camera.Hey - I dont see myself as a prude but I'm a woman and women just dont turn me on by being provocative. I don't need to share my living room with them in such quantity as they do nothing for me, I don't identify with them and for me they detract from George.The best video clip for me was the simplest - George in white, on his own, really getting into and expressing the soul and mood of a song.The question is why George has needed the women thing throughout his videos. Is it because this has become current video style (unfortunately)?Is it because men like to communicate to other men their place in the pecking order by being able to attract and be surrounded by 'babes' (and isnt George's voice and standing beyond the need for those games?)Was George trying to show he can hold his own in a straight world even though he has been 'bi-' in sexuality and when falling in love prefers men?So why does he need this whole female thing when I'd guess most of his fans are women and like me arent turned on by this stuff so it misses the mark?I havent seen myself as a women's lib type, and certainly not moralistic - but I really am, as a modern woman, rather tired of all the objectifying of women. George is about the last person who needs to keep flogging these sex images. He stands tall in all respects as an entertainer and he seems to be a genuinely nice guy who can afford to simplify and just share himself with audiences.I've had the CD set that matches these videos so as these dont distract with the images bye-bye DVD - and hopefully looking forward to a George Michael concert DVD if one is ever released!",N/A
481592,"My 5-star review is based on the two leads in this production.  While the rest of the cast was adequate, these two lifted it to a high plane of achievement.  Of course, the other star-performer, Donizetti, gets his accolades as ever for his rich and irresistable melodies.The singing by Pendatchanska and Sabatini was beyond praise.  Both rose to an occasion that I am thrilled to have had captured (since I wasn't in Naples that night).  I cannot understand how one human can sing the queen without being scraped vocally raw by evening's end, but Pendatchanska finished this grueling role with panache and beauty of tone.  Sabatini while not having as much demanded, sang with lyricism and heart -- something I have not always found in abundance in the past with him in live performance.  Perhaps it was just me, because he certainly acquitted himself beautifully here.This is a treasurable performance and will stay on my ""5-star"" shelf with the very few others that earn that rating from me.",Donizetti - Roberto Devereux

598799,"as a follow up to Buffy, Angel really shines in season one. the part I like about Angel more than Buffy is that Angel is more mature than buffy and more reasonable. I wasn't really thrilled about Buffy season one, I mean it's like a-sixteen-year-old-teenager-trying-to-save-the-world. HELLO!! way toooo innocent. it's like one of those disney movies such as agent cody banks where kids are big heros and their parents don't understand them. Seen waaaayyy too many of those on disney channel. At least Angel actually has a REASON to save the world. You see in season one that Angel started by helping people from being killed by demons because he was tortured by his soul and seeking redemption, THAN it leads into that he eventually got involved with saving the world, fair enough. Whereas Buffy didn't really have a reason to save the world. In season one she already began to save the world simply because she is the Slayer. How empty is that! Angel also proves more worthy than Buffy because he simply ""Owns"" the show: he is the boss, the top of foodchain, and nothing will stop him from what needs to be done. This I liked more than Buffy.I saw in many reviews people say this season is one of the weaker seasons of Angel, and I'll have to say I disagree. In fact, I think this season is one of the best. Season one of Angel was kept simple, but true. even though many of the episodes are like monster-of-the-week, the strength is not in the adventure of killing the monsters, but in the growth of the relationships of Angel and his friends- Doyle, Cordelia and Wesley. This is the kind of season that you just sit down and laugh and enjoy without much thinking to it. So what's wrong with this simplicity??? There are some really touching episodes such as I will remember you, hero and the Faith sequence. But mainly you see Angel transformed from being totally reserved to actually starting to care about those he saved. this season is mainly about Angel trying to seek redemption and his purpose in the world, and he thinks he found it when Wesley told of the prophecy of Shanshu, which is sort of a revelation that Angel does have a place in the world instead of living forever but always cut off from it. In this season, you began to discover Angel's many unique talents which you never do in Buffy- he can draw really well, cook really well and speaks at least seven languages. It is also brilliant of Joss Whedon to show the benefits and knowledge Angel has from living 244 years- how Angel is incredibly historically and socially literate- something you never really think about when you are watching other shows which has the immortal being elements in it. The thing I love most about Angel in season one is the image and feeling Angel creates when you watch him. He makes you feel really comfortable, safe and protective, that you should never be afraid because he will always watch over you, protect you no matter what. This connects to the show's theme- That Angel is no longer ""Angel""- the demon with a face of an angel( as he is in Buffy), but Angel- the protector of innocents. Which also tides to the irony that he is actually not really safe and can turn into the altimate evil in no time. Overall, definitely five stars. This is the show you will want to watch over and over again. And this is the season that will be the promise of wonderful following seasons to come.",Angel - Season One
345533,"Who is YOUR favorite on-screen devil?  Surely not John Ritter or George Burns?  Not when there's Max Von Sydow in &quot;Needful Things&quot; and Al Pacino in &quot;The Devil's Advocate.&quot;  Yet these two recent superb performances pale beside Walter Huston's &quot;Mr. Scratch&quot; in &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster.&quot;  Huston is a jolly Scratch, one who never misses an opportunity for petty sin, be it swiping a pie or a bunch of carrots, guzzling hard cider, or encouraging a bit of lethargy.  Through it all he never forgets his big mission of corruption and soul-gathering.  He also takes his losses in stride.As he battles for the soul of one Jabez Stone, a hapless New Hampshire farmer, he must battle a stern but likeable Daniel Webster, ably played by great character actor Edward Arnold.  The culminating trial by 'the quick and the dead' is eerie and touching.The film has an awesome Bernard Herrmann score and effects and cinematography that still look good over half a century later.This film is profound yet intensly witty, much like the original Stephen Vincent Benet short story.This is one film you should have no hestitation in buying.  You will want to watch it again and again.",N/A
777701,"The defence That this season is too dark doesn't hold up when this season is compared to other seasons. This is the only real defence offered for season six. Most other seasons 2,3,4,5 are at least as dark, but they aren't boring. Dark can be many things and it doesn't have to be boring. Saying it's dark as the excuse for every one of the problems isn't a line of argument it's religous mantra or a soap box routine, depending on what crowd is present.This season has no concept that Spike was ever a good character. Even Anya as a human is show to be physicaly stronger.Any character outside of the clique of three (Buffy, Willow, Xander) has not rights. Xander dumps Anya in a roomfull of her friends (many of who are vengence demons) and not one of them does anything about it. Xander the uncoordinated, out of shape, jerk beats the hell out of a legendary vampire with ease. With a little motivation Spike could wipe out the Harris family tree, chip or no chip. If Spike didn't want the pain he could have used harmless grapling untill Xander was exausted.Buffy's trauma isn't the reason for her treating others the way she does, it's just her excuse.Willow's personality is supperseded by her powers. Even when she gives magic up, instead of seeing some of her old Willowisms she pulls out a laptop as if that's all she is.The dissolution of the personatilies of the principal characters, and the clear lack of regard the writters hold for the secondary charactes is the reason why I hate this season. Not some supposed &quot;Darkness&quot;.I give it 2 stars because of great performances from Alyson Hannigan, Emma Caulfield, and James Marsters. There are many other great arguments, many are listed as reviews here, as to what went wrong with this season. To bad the total fanatics will fail to listen, and just repeat their &quot;Dark&quot; chant.I don't want to change opinions. I just want people who like it to understand, that there are inteligent reasons that people like me don't like this season.",N/A

But the music was the secondary part of this performance, really. The sheer depth of emotion shown by the speakers made it very clear that this was NOT just a commercial extravaganza.Most potent of all was Clint Eastwood - he literally sent chills thru me. He is never a glib guy, and is always in control, but he wore his emotions all over this night. From his ""Unforgiven"" coat to his words. Especially his words. He almost rambled, almost babbled from the overpowering rage he felt. Sheer, utter emotional honesty.This DVD is beyond compare.",N/A

Tatum O'Neal steals the show here; she definitely deserved the Oscar for her great portrayal of the way-too street smart for her age orphan (maybe) Addie Pray (Loggins).  Adults and kids can enjoy this together without much fear of the admittedly seedy subject matter -- con artistry, prostitution, racial exploitation, the corruption of youth, etc.  You can't help but root for Addie all the while knowing that Moses will never be a good father, role model or successful &quot;businessman.&quot;The black and white cinematography recalls classic Margaret Bourke-White Depression-era photos as well as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; but without the need for Prozac or counseling.  The soundtrack is comprised of Thirties pop radio standards that fit perfectly without calling too much attention to themselves.Madeline Kahn is a scream as Miss Trixie Delight, John Hillerman excels in two roles:  a sheriff and his brother, a local bootleggar, and P.J.

409936,"The Passion of Darkly Noon is a strange, mesmerizing film that you can't help but get sucked into when you turn it on. It stars Brendan Frasier, Ashley Judd and an early role from Aragorn - Viggo Mortensen, sporting the same scruff and locks as he did in LOTR. The film is permeated with bizarre imagery, very much dream-like, as another review noted.To me the film deals with the repression of feelings. Darkly Noon, the Brendan Frasier lead, was raised in a cultish Christian community which was pillaged by nearby townsfolk - they killed all of the cult, leaving only Darkly Noon alive. He finds his way onto Ashley and Viggo's ranch where they invite him to stay.From here we see Darkly try to express his sexual feelings for Ashley, feelings which he was never allowed to express as a normal boy developing into a man, and he expresses them in the most horrific ways. The only way he knows how to appropriate his new feelings of lust is by hurting himself - using barbed wire, glass, etc. - and eventually others. It's a powerful statement that feelings left unexpressed (or rather, disallowed to express) will still evince themselves in one way or another, sometimes in very bad ways.We also learn that Brendan Frasier is a great actor and it's unfortunate he always chooses roles like Dudley Dooright and George of the Jungle. The last thing we learn is that Ashley Judd is really, really hot. But we knew that already.",Passion of Darkly Noon VHS
842426,"Saved! is a brilliantly biting satire about students at a strict Chrisitian high school and how they deal with the unwanted pregnancy of one of their prized students. It is brutal, honest, funny, and intense. The cast is simply amazing. Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Patrick Fugit, and Eva Amurri are all superb and it's great seeing Macaulay Culkin back in more adult roles (also see Party Monster). Mary-Louise Parker is fantastic as well, as always in her supporting roles. This is by far the perfect dream cast for any independent film. I think lots of people will be looking at Mandy Moore differently from now on, whether it be for better or for worse.As a gay Christian not accepted by his family, I can definitely relate to this film, and honestly say that none of it is exaggeration. All these people exist and they are all people I know. My friends and I really enjoyed the film because it definitely hit close to home and was something we could laugh at and also discuss seriously. Yes, the film is played for laughs, but it is also a very serious topic that really makes you think about society and the ridiculous expectations they have. All the situations in the film ring true with an emotional depth rarely seen in teen films. None of the events will seem off the wall to anyone familiar with modern adolescence or this particular religious subculture. Scary, isn't it?The film definitely made me think about what this world is coming to and how people so devoted to GOD fail to accept anyone who is a little different. As one of the characters said toward the end, GOD loves us all and that is something people should understand, but choose not to. It's ridiculous and this film explores that well.Compared to the rest of the film, the ending is a bit weak but it was compensated for by the main message of the film, which is acceptance of people and their differences (and this includes acceptance of Christian Fundamentalists). The film is not a mean-spirited parody; but while it pokes fun at some extreme examples of Christian Fundamentalism, it doesn't make anyone out to be a villain and it doesn't have an anti-Christian message despite what so many people think. People who think that Jews, gays, and unwed mothers need to be saved instead of accepted probably won't enjoy the message of this film, but they just need to deal with it.I commend everyone involved in the film. It is a movie that needed to be made and I am so glad it was. Many people will hate it, many will oppose it, but everyone should see it, because this is exactly how the world we live in is. Take a chance and see Saved. You might live to enjoy it.",Saved!
694422,"This was a waste of money for me. I read and loved the graphic novels, so I figured that I would like this just as much. NOT! This was a major disappointment.The storyline of the manga was fast-paced, humorous, and very entertaining. Although it occasionally became difficult to distinguish what was going on, on the whole it was a lot of fun to read.Unfortunately, that same fun storyline was mangled and then dropped by the anime writers. Now, instead of centering on the K-Fights and high school life, it focuses on an interdimensional adventure that doesn't play out. Ryoko is perfect as a fighter, but it is difficult to see the slightly conceited, sword-wielding samurai beauty as fighting dragons and talking to princesses. And there is not even any background given on why this dimension and its ruler need her help.Then another new character comes in, and OF COURSE he knows all about this other dimension, the fight with the dragon, and the talk with the princess. I have one question--who is he, and how does he know all that? The fight with the dragon was a private affair with Ryoko, the dragon, and the princess. So where was he? *sighs* This is yet another thing in this new storyline that doesn't mesh.On the other hand, the characters are wonderful. Ryoko is my favorite, with her rival Azumi following in an extremely close second. Both girls are awesome fighters, and really fun characters. Shizuma didn't get much of a chance to shine here, but from what I can tell he is exactly the same as he was in the manga. The reporter is still a creepy little stalker with a thing for Ryoko, although his English voice actor is the person who played Tai from Digimon (its impossible for me to watch RBHS without thinking--&quot;Hey, that's Tai!&quot;) And just like in the manga, Ryoko's best friend is kicked out of the picture by the arrival of Shizuma.The art is beautiful. Colors are bright and easy to look at, and the movement could not be smoother. The fight scenes are the only reason I watch this dvd anymore--those scenes are wicked cool! So there is one redeeming factor.The voice acting is great in both versions. I think the English is better. The girls are not high and squeaky, and there is a wider range of emotions. In fact, I find their voices rather soothing.I feel I should mention that my computer's dvd player has a problem with this dvd, making the soundtrack skip and jump. This is very disconcerting for a dvd.Although I like the voices, the art, and the characters, I still don't like this anime, mainly because of the warped storyline. It has been more than a year since I have watched this, and I don't think I'll be watching it again anytime soon.",Real Bout High School: Enter the Samurai Girl - Volume 1
1874,"I use many home workout videos but this one is certainly a classic.  Although there is more than one workout on this DVD I always do the Kickboxing Challening one-and the name says it all; it is indeed challenging.The workout will make you sweat and involves lots of kicking, punching, hooks, uppercuts, etc.  If you have no prior kickboxing experience, you should still be able to follow this workout.  She is wonderful at cueing and starts each punch and kick series very slowly so you can learn the moves.  You will feel this workout, and best of all, you should see results.Following the basic cardio section is a special buns section.  You will need a chair (or something else to support yourself with) to do this and YOU WILL DEFINITELY feel it!! Basically you do some lunges and many kicks to improve form, strengthen and work those legs... this is a very effective section.  Next, you learn some kickboxing stances that are HARD!!! This really works your legs (strengthens and stretches). It is much harder than it looks!!Then, the instructor will walk you through a series of challenging kickboxing routines.  These were too hard for me to follow and I am usually too tired to do them.  I like to just skip this section... it is not very long anyhow.Finally, the abs and back section.  I don't find this that effective and it is too short.Anyhow, this workout is great and challenging! A+",N/A

768686,"in the fantastic ""Deduce You say""; a WB takeoff on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in this version you have Daffy as the famous Sherlock Holmes and Porky Pig as Watson. The dialogue and atmospheric setting in this one are amazing and VERY funny; when they go to the local pub looking for the Shropshire Slasher, Daffy leans back on the bar and orders ""hot buttered gin"" with a dozen darts stuck in his beak, the price of annoying one of the female bar patrons. When the object of their search finally makes an appearance, Porky interviews him and elicits the information thusly: ""Name, my good man?"" ""Shropshire Slasher."" ""Occupation?"" ""Shropshire Slasher."" Doesn't get any better than this; these cartoons are absolutely hilarious, and this collection has some real gems,my personal favorite being ""Feed the Kitty"" a Chuck Jones masterpiece, involving an English Bulldog and his tiny kitty friend. When Marc Antony (Bulldog) first encounters kitty, he barks furiously, instead of running away the kitty purrs and rubs up against him. It is mutual love at first sight, and although Marc Antony endeavors to hide his little friend, eventually he is caught red-handed. There is a scene of the lady of the house baking cookies, and the kitty has been hiding in the batter bowl; when Marc Antony looks through the window, all he sees is the mixing bowl operating a a furious pace, and thinking his kitty has been chopped to bits, emits a tortured howl and collapses in grief on the sidewalk...when the lady comes out and lets him back in she gives him a cookie...unfortunately the cookie is in the shape of a kitten! Thinking it is his friend, he puts it on his back, where the real kitty used to ride, and then his chin quivers and he breaks down in really inconsolable sobbing. Then the kitty, unhurt, walks up to him and purrs and rubs his chin; Marc Antony is overjoyed! In the end, he is allowed to keep his kitty. This is a pure joy to watch.""Dripalong Daffy"" is a riot; Porky Pig as sidekick and comic relief to Daffy Duck, who becomes sheriff of Gower Gulch, (an inside joke/reference to the nickname for the WB Studio, located in what was then known as Gower Gulch...) and they enter the local saloon looking for a villian, who, when he enters the salon, demands his ""usual."" This is a frightening concoction that necessitates the bartender donning Asbestos gloves, face shield and a special apron; then tongs! The mixture is so volatile it emits tiny explosions, adn then, when ice is added, the cubes jump out of the glass and run away screaming...The bad guy downs this appalling drink and his only reaction is his hat does a backflip. Daffy demands his own; the results are somewhat different; he turns all shades of the rainbow, including PLAID and POLKA DOTS, then walks arounfd like a mechanical doll and then recites Mary Had a Little Lamb in a child's high pitched voice...the showdown is wonderful; all kinds of amazing camera angles, and shots from high hotel windows, and the ominous clanking of spurs...this is strongly reminiscent of ""High Noon"" and is simply terrific.""Wearing of the Grin"" is one of the most surreal cartoons ever to emerge from the amazing minds of the WB animators; this is Salvador Dali come to life...Porky Pig, travling through Ireland, becomes lost and tired in a thunderstorm and seeks refuge at a local haunted castle, and the caretakers, O'Pat and O'Mike, clay pips firmly upside down in their mouths, come and assist Porky and get him a ""nice soft bed"" for the night...but first the O'Pat and O'Mike characters split up and we see they are actually 2 Leprechauns...and one of them asks Porky ""Have you seen my other half, sir?"" There they are, 2 separate Leprechauns, and one of them says to Porky ""Isn't this sight enough to make the heart stand crossways in ye?"" Porky goes into shock and they put after his head hits the pillow, Porky falls asleep and has a Dali nightmare...the end of which he is sentenced to the wearing of the green shoes. These shoes are tap shoes and force him to dance and dance uncontrollably; finally he wakes up and escapes from the castle.""Water Water Every Hare"" is another great one; Bugs falls asleep and is carried out of his rabbit hole by a rain storm and is deposited at the nightmare Castle of the Evil Scientist, (a miniscule version of Boris Karloff) whose castle conveniently has a neon sign stating ""Evil Scientist"" flashing off and on...once inside, Bugs is going to be used for his brain to go into the cranium of the enormous metal robot the scientist hasbuilt....Naturally,m Bugs has some objections to this and thre scientist enlists the aid of the Monster..this is a great character, covered with hair and complete with sneakers! Bugs finally corrals the Monster and shrinks him down to about three inches; he packs his bags and leaves in disgust...when the scientist returns, Bugs breaks a bottle of chloroform and chases Bugs in a hilarious slomo chase. saying ""come.....back......here..........you........rab....bit.""Great stuff, a must have, and wait 'til you see what's coming next!

424298,"""Wonder Bar"" is a place where nothing ever happens.If you recall that was the tagline for the 1932 best picture Oscar winner ""Grand Hotel"", that's the movie where Greta Garbo wants to be alone.""Wonder Bar"" was a movie that tried to be another ""Grand Hotel"" only it is a major disappointment.The film deals with very serious issues including suicide and premartial sex.Like the 1932 film, ""Wonder Bar"" has its own all-star cast headed by Al Jolson (Al Wonder), Kay Francis (Liana Renaud), Dolores Del Rio (Inez), Dick Powell (Tommy), Guy Kibbee (Henry Simpson), and Hugh Herbert (Corey Pratt).The story goes something like this (try to keep up!) Al is the owner of a very sought after club ""Wonder Bar"", he is also in love with Inez (Del Rio), but Inez loves Harry (Ricardo Cortez). Now we have Tommy (Powell) who works at the club, he too loves Inez, in fact, the two were an item before. Meanwhile Liane Renaud (Francis) is cheating on her husband with Harry! Henry Simpson (Kibbee) and Pratt (Herbert) have decided to take their wives to the club, but the two men keep flirting with much younger women. And finally there's Capt. Hugo Von Ferring, who has lost all of his money to the stock market, and has decided to do away with himself.Now think, all of these stories aregoing on and it's all done to music! That was one fo the film's big mistakes.I know what a lot of you are thinking. So what if a musical takes on serious subjects, just look at opera. And you are right, but, the difference is in opera the songs serve a purpose. They justify the characters feeling. In ""Wonder Bar"" the songs take away from the plot. They are two seperate things.In ""Grand Hotel"" many of the same issues were dealth with, but, ""Hotel"" succeeds because it knew how to deal with its material.The material in ""Wonder Bar"" cries out for drama. It is meant to be taken serious, but for some reason it was decided to go against the overtone of the material and turn it into a musical.What does work in the film's favor is the suprising frankness of the script. Issues are dealth with head on. We know the captain wants to committ suicide. We know Liane has been cheating on her husband. We know what Kibbee and Herbert are up to. And in a turn of event that really surprised me Kibbee and Herbert's wives fo not take this lying down. They flirt with men as well, both wanting to achieve the same things.I always thought the production code went into effect in 1933, but, I guess I was wrong, because I don't see how any of this could have gotten past.""Wonder Bar"" also has a disappointing ending. There doesn't seem to be a sense of a real ""conclusion"". We can't believe the actions some of these characters make. There are also missed comedic opportunities dealing with the Kibbee story-line.Both Kibbee and his wife have agreed to meet someone at midnight, now each has to get the other to go to sleep, but the film never shows us scenes dealing with that. In the process they pass a good opportunity for some laughs.The music in the film was by Harry Warren, one of the great composers of the times. Sadly the songs are not up to par with some of the other songs he wrote during the period such as ""I Only Have Eyes For You"", ""Lullaby of Broadway"", and ""42nd Street"". The best song in this film is ""Why Do I Dream Those Dreams"" the worst ""Goin' To Heaven On A Mule"", a perfect example of how the songs do not match the story-line, but insteadwas used as a showcase for Jolson.""Wonder Bar"" had the makings of a great film, it's sad to see how things went so badly.Bottom-line: An unclever hybrid of drama and music. The story deserved to be taken serious instead comes second to the songs. Missed comedic opportunities don't help either. One big mess of a film.",Wonder Bar VHS

Schindler's List was not the kind of film I had at first expected to come from Steven Spielberg, having grown up with E.T. and Close Encounters. To say that I was surprised by the power of this film would be a gross understatement, never before I have found myself so moved by a work of cinema. The subject matter is so disturbing, the images haunt you long after the film has ended and Spielberg's use of black and white is a stark contrast to what we expect from movies today. If there is any movie that I would recommend, any film that I would beg my friends and family to witness... it is Schindler's List. It will stand throughout the ages as a testament to the horrors of the Holocaust, and the power that we each, as individuals, have to change the world even in the face humanity's worst.

The story line has some holes in it,but name me one movie that fits in this genre that doesn't have some kind of plot hole in it. I feel that this movie took over where Resident Evil left off (with the zombies on speed basically). I appreciated the alternate endings that are available on the DVD and was kind of upset that they gave in and gave the theatre release a typical &quot;Hollywood&quot; ending,but knowing that there were alternatives is refreshing.Not sure if this is a movie I would want to own(once you've seen it you pretty much know how it goes and i don't see it being a repeat view type of deal)but definately worth seeing at least once.",28 Days Later
93849,"Director:  David FincherCast:  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, John C. McGinley, Kevin Spacey.Running Time:  127 minutes.Rated R for extreme violence, gore, and language.One of the most gruesome, yet intriguing mystery/suspense thrillers of the past decade, ""Seven"" is widely considered one of the best of its kind-and rightfully so.  It is a film that will test the stomachs of all its viewers, yet even those who feel queasy throughout the entire picture stay engaged because of the impeccable acting, top-notch direction, and riveting cinematography.Detective William Somerset (a stupendous, touching performance from the always admirable Morgan Freeman) is looking forward to retirement-he has had it with all the horror, stress, and dead partners that accompany his job.  His young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), is looking forward to follow in his footsteps, but realizes that his feet are in too deep as a serial killer who calls himself ""John Doe"" begins to parade around the city-killing each of his victims in a pattern that references to the seven deadly sins.  As both detectives uncover more of the truth about the horrific killer, they become entangled in a ghoulish scheme that will shock them.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a fine performance as Mills's distressed wife.Director David Fincher creates a dark and disturbing film, using Freeman and Pitt well (both give slightly dark, somber performances) to his advantage.  The unique camera angles, explosive chase sequences, and vivid crime scenes enhance the picture, making ""Seven"" an inimitable thriller that is so effective, powerful, and alarming that it will scare your socks right off.  The finale is one of the most electrifying of all time, pitting Pitt (no pun intended) against the evil murderer in an emotional, unforgettable showdown.  A rare cinematic experience that will make you have nightmares for weeks-but enjoy every second of it.  The Platinum Series DVD is phenomenal, which includes many deleted scenes, alternate endings, and a DVD-rom exclusive that allows you to look into the killer's mind.  A captivating, spellbinding look at how the horrors of society can simply drive an ordinary man mad.",Seven
366228,"The 1950's decade saw an explosion in cinemas of every kind of tentacled, or oversized creature taking out its vengeance on mankind for its thoughtless handling of atomic testing and the environment. In the process of creating these fantastic creatures the legendary career of special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen came into its own. Long before computers dominated the special effects industry and worked their miracles with the press of a button this gifted craftsman created some of the most stunning special effects and creatures that have ever been seen in science fiction. Even today most of his work holds up well with some of his more memorable creations being his splendid creatures in such classics as ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"", and ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"". In ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" this genius tackles another sort of sea creature on the rampage in the form of a giant Octopus which has been dislodged from its habitat in the depths of the Pacific Ocean by H-Bomb testing. While ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"", suffered from a smaller budget than Harryhausen was used to and is today considered one of his lesser efforts there is still much classic animation work and drama to admire. Certainly for all science fiction buffs like myself it is easy to see that the creatures attack on the Golden Gate Bridge and the port area of San Francisco in the stories thrilling climax contains some of the most memorable sci fi imagery from the entire decade and these scenes have rightly gone down into science fiction folklore.The action starts ona seemingly routine submarine mission headed by Commander Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey), in the Pacific which encounters a strange blip on the sonar which ends up colliding with the submarine. Unsure of what it was the mission heads home for repairs and then a strange rubbery substance is found attached to the submarine's rudder. Taking the mysterious substance to the Naval Research lab Pete encounters marine biologists Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and Prof. John Carter (Donald Curtis), who after exhaustive research discover that the material is part of a potentially huge Octopus. Prof Joyce works out a theory that this beast is an inhabitant of the deepest parts of the Pacific Ocean where Octopus and other sea creatures can grow to fantastic size, and that it has become radioactive from the H-bomb testing in the area. Rising to the surface in search of non contaminated food the warning signs are there that trouble along the coastal areas could be only a short time away. Meanwhile reports begin to come in of coastal damage and missing persons and when a cargo vessel is destroyed at sea with only a handful of crew rescued the alarm goes out. Interviewed by both Pete and Lesley the men tell of a terrifying creature with huge tentacled arms which came out of the ocean to attack their ship. Confirming that the creature does exist a coastal alert is put into place and the San Francisco Bay area appears to be the next point of contact with the creature as it searches for food. The navy create a warhead that can be fired from a submarine that will puncture the huge creature and explode inwardly and Pete prepares his crew for action. Despite the best efforts of the military the octopus manages to infiltrate San Francisco harbour and begins to climb the Golden Gate Bridge causing a great deal of damage to the structure. Prof. Carter manages a narrow escape on the bridge thanks to Pete's intervention and when all the power on the Bridge is turned off the giant octopus submerges itself in the bay and later surfaces at the dock region. Causing mass panic and destruction the military, with the use of flame throwers, eventually drive the creature out into the bay. Pete's men then prepare to fire the missile into the creature which requires some tricky aqua diving and its only after Pete is badly injured and John goes out to finish the job that the explosion manages to kill the creature. Believing that both Pete and John are lost after the blast there is a general relief when both men safely surface out in the bay.Classic 1950's science fiction is how I would describe ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"". We certainly do see too little of the creature of the title and indeed the giant octopus does lack a bit of the character of some of Harryhausen's other creations however the action scenes here are top rate, in particular the creatures assault on San Francisco. Kenneth Tobey playing Commander Pete Mathews has the sort of masculine, square jawed presense that is ideally suited to this type of action story and he had already well handled the suspense in another earlier science fiction classic in the unforgettable ""The Thing From Another World"",in 1951. Faith Domergue plays an interesting character here as the educated professor who develops the theory of where the creature has come from. Part independant woman and part scream queen of the fifties her character does come across for the most part as a refreshing change from many of the typical sci fi roles handed to women in this decade. Particulary memorable is her scene where she extracts information from the rescued sailor by removing her wrap and asking him for a cigarette while leaving the intercom open for the navy brass to listen in. It never fails to make me laugh and is an interesting snap shot of ""another time"", so foreign to how it would be played nowadays. First and foremost however the chief attraction in this movie is of course the often superb stop motion effects of Ray Harryhausen. ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"", marked the first of his legendary collaborations with producer Charles H. Schneer that took the pair through many films together right up to the impressive ""Clash of the Titians"" in 1981. The sight of the creature demolishing a section of the Golden Gate Bridge or attacking a cargo ship at sea are still breathtaking in their visual impact and the vivid sound effects employed in particular when the creature is being driven back through the streets of San Francisco by flame throwers is outstanding. Typically for this type of film there is the standard romance between the characters played by Kenneth Tobey and Faith Domergue however luckily here it really doesn't get in the way of the action. The slowness in parts of ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"", is due more in fact to director Robert Gordon's frequent dallying with naval and submarine activities  than with anything else but even then is not too distracting.Solid ""Saturday Afternoon Matinee"" material is how many see this creature feature and while certainly it has that nostalgic appeal I really appreciate it for the at times superb stop motion special effects created on a limited budget by Ray Harryhausen. A similiar effort to this filmed nowadays would cost countless millions but here we have the real genius of our film pioneers in special effects on display. ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"", has it all for sci fi lovers like myself, namely an angry creature disturbed from its habitat that goes on a rampage which always makes for a good story. Certainly there have been better ""monster on the loose"", efforts from the 1950's but this film is well worth the time in particular for a journey back to a simpler time in filmmaking without the huge budgets one expects nowadays. Enjoy!",It Came From Beneath the Sea VHS

These people all love books - not mass market knock-offs, but books rich in history and poetry.  The trans-Atlantic relationship is brought off beautifully.

They seem an odd couple, yet after a few short weeks they marry and come home to his imposing English country estate, Manderley.  The young bride is overwhelmed with her new, lavish lifestyle and is especially intimidated by the forbidding housekeeper who keeps her first mistress' memory and influence alive.  Maxim reveals a terrible secret which forever alters the couple's life, and affects the very existence of Manderley.This wonderfully atmospheric tale, complete with swirling fog and spooky organ music, will take you away to a world where little Cinderella really does marry the handsome prince and lives in the mysterious castle, but things have a nasty habit of going bump in the night.  Joan Fontaine gives a breathtaking performance, convincing us she really is crippled with feelings of inadequacy, despite being a flawless beauty.  Judith Anderson is the sneering, contemptuous housekeeper whose devotion to her former mistress turns to madness.  Laurence Olivier makes a properly snobbish and mysterious Maxim and manages to be the hero despite a fatal flaw.  The title character, Rebecca (the first Mrs. de Winter), is never seen but is a powerful force, as is the imposing house of Manderley.

856519,"I give my five-star rating to Sarah Brightman, the back-up singers, dancers, musicians, set designers, and costumers. The DVD production and direction are another matter.This is the second DVD of Sarah's (the other being ""Harem: Desert Fantasy) in which the lighting was, at times, so bright as to nearly, or completely, obscure our view of her. I lost count of the number of times the camera wound up pointed directly into a spotlight. If this much lighting was needed for the benefit of the audience, they should have been prepared with filters for the cameras. As any fan of Sarah Brightman knows, when she is performing, it doesn't take special lighting for her to glow.Next, the constant cutting to different camera angles, and shots of the back-up singers, musicians, and dancers, was distracting, and often took us away from key moments of Sarah's performance. When she was dancing, or singing a particularly important part of a song, I did not need a shot from the ceiling at the back of the auditorium, pointed into a spotlight, or of a piano/violin player. All of these people deserve camera time, but at the appropriate moments, not just because you have the shot. This direction, and editing, reminded me of the music video explosion in the 1980's on MTV. ""Music video director"" suddenly became a lucrative job, and often a gateway to bigger things. So every fledgling director pulled every video effect he/she had out of their bag of tricks, and wound up giving us some of the most horrendous music videos of all time. The purpose of these music videos, as it ought to be with a production like this one, SHOULD be to present the artist(s) in a favorable light, and compliment the music. What they wound up doing, and what happened at times here, was that the artist was obscured, and the music overwhelmed. Some artists never recovered from these disasters. I got that feeling as I watched this DVD. It seemed that they were so proud of having so many cameras covering this show, that they wanted to make sure that they used ALL of them on every song.To sum up, this DVD is MORE than worth owning, since Sarah, cast and crew, completely overcome this misuse of artistic license, and triumph over it all. To directors, editors, cinematographers, lighting techs out there, PLEASE remember that an artist like Sarah Brightman doesn't need much embellishment (watch ""La Luna"" - practically bare stage most of the time - and wonderful!), and remember that in the term ""musical production"" ""production"" is the SECOND word.",N/A

Obviously neither he nor his agent read the script prior to signing on.This farce revolved around the theory believed by Cage, apparently a treasure seeker, and his family, that a treasure map existed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  This map would lead to the location of the National Treasure, an extensive hoard accumulated by the Knights Templar and Freemasons, and hidden from the British back in colonial times.Cage in an expedition in the Arctic uncovers a ship buried beneath the ice which holds a key to the mystery.

And so a race commences between Cage and Bean to steal the Declaration of Independence and ultimately uncover the treasure.Along the way, Cage recruits soon to be love interest, Diane Kruger, a head honcho working in the Archives.This flick seemed to attempt to copy a format popularized by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; swashbuckling hero, bimbo sidekick and blonde hanger on and love interest.

However, NOTHING can prepare you for this emotional devastation that is Irreversible. It's a primal assault on the senses and emotions, unlike any other I've ever experienced. One word of advice: if you really want to try to get to the core of this work, watch it until the very end. Beware though: it is literally NOT for the faint of heart. And I don't mean queasy stomachs by that, although those sensitive in that area should also think thrice before deciding to watch this.The first quarter of the movie is an absolute abomination. The first twenty minutes are something that will probably stay in your mind for life. It is that barbaric and gruesome. I freely admit, I could watch only part of the murder that takes place in the club. I had to avert, even close, my eyes. And I had to lower the sound, completely, until the monstrous deed was done. This sequence is formidably potent, and has the power to make you feel literally close to panic. For the record, I've seen it all too, in terms of horror movies and the like, so I've seen much more than my fair share of gore ;-) Or at least I thought so. The ""problem"" is that it goes far beyond just gore on film. I don't think I can clearly depict here in mere words the why and how, the reason, regarding why it's so brutal, so raw a shock, but the fact is, it's a lightning bolt right into your cortex.Frankly speaking, the infamous rape scene coming some fifteen minutes after that is not nearly as traumatizing. Sure, it's atrocious, hard, viciously brutal. But honestly, what do you expect from a rape? Of course it's gonna be one the most despicable act that you'll see, no surprise here. I digress, but what did people expect of that scene before the scandals and controversy began? It's for sure what a rape should be: violently repulsive and merciless. However, except for a few seconds at the scene's end, it's nowhere near as primitive and graphically indescribable as the first -and only- murder in the film.All this being said, this work is THE most vibrant anti-violence statement I've ever seen put on film. There is no embellishment of any kind here, no stylish editing, smart cuts, slow motion... It shows violence -and all of it- only as it should be seen: repulsive to the extreme, blindly and uselessly destructive, utterly unable to resolve anything, and as the most terrifying dead-end that exists; indeed, having totally irreversible results. There is no coming back from such acts, no redemption either. Man just has to live with his obsession of being stronger than his neighbour, whatever it takes. It's also, let's admit it, a very cruel movie, in terms of its resolution -yes, the beginning of the movie as such, as the character of Pierre destroys the wrong man, and the rape's perp is not only alive and kicking, but apparently rejoicing at the sight of another act of terrifying violence. That, by the way, puts an end once and for all to all the ridiculous comments I've heard that the movie was a glorification of revenge. This is in total opposition to what really happens in this story, and on the screen. It's up there for everyone to see. The film is much too clever to try to deliver a lesson however, but it's obvious to anyone who watched it closely that Noe does not condone violence of any kind, but condemns it without appeal. He just gives a cold, harsh look at whatever is sleeping -or not- inside ALL of us. There is no clear cut, prefabricated opinion to have about the madness and rage these people dive in. This is part of the unease we feel as we watch... The characters are likeable, but blend. Anyone could be in their place.The movie shows it as real as it gets, not only the violence of course, but in terms of witnessing plain, normal people who are going straight to hell because of uncontrollable circumstances. All it takes is nine minutes, and dark, nasty chance. All of this is not preachy, by the way, just the embryo of reflections I have from seeing this film a few days ago. I'm only beginning to feel good -no, strike that, NORMAL again just now. So this scribing is probably not very structured or coherent. ;-)There's much to be said about the arresting camera work, the infernal soundtrack (the synthesizer drone during the club scene evokes a demented and anguished monochord lament), and mostly the quality of the acting -suffice to say that all the actors in the movie do a superb job of capturing truth.In the end, Irreversible is a most unique, if sobering, experience. A traumatizing experience, but ultimately a rewarding one, as there is good and beauty in the film too. It's quite a paradoxical feeling though, and starkly ironic; this beauty is all the more dramatic because as we are witness to it, we do know at the same time it's about to be irremediably destroyed soon. That's also why it's obvious the movie could only be edited as it is, telling the story backwards, comparisons with Memento be damned.So finally, whether or not you'll be willing to pay quite a lot in terms of emotional cost to experience the power of this film is all the question.Good luck...",N/A

188166,"This DVD was exactly what I had hoped for. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't want a DVD of their video catalog.  Although videos are great, they are &quot;performance pieces&quot; and you can catch those any time you want on MTV.  This DVD brings you inside the studio .. and, in truth, inside the very creative minds of the members of the band.  You get to see exactly what process they go thru to create their masterpieces.  The DVD includes moments of brilliance, frustration, friendship, anger and sheer joy at realizing that their project is complete.  All five members of the band are showcased and it becomes clear how each one is vital to the survival of the group as a whole.  They candidly discuss their years of &quot;drinking and drugging&quot; .. and the lessons that they learned from it along the way.  Being a musician myself, I was fascinated with the recording process and the methods the band-mates utilize to achieve a finished product.  You get to hear the (now famous) hits in their infancy stages -- different lyrics, different music, etc. -- and the steps that were taken along the way to create the songs as we now know them.  You see the anguish the guys go through when one of their songs is cut from an album.  As Joe Perry puts it .. &quot;these songs are their babies and somebody else gets to decide which of them will grow up .. and which ones won't&quot;.Unlike the theatrical quality that you see in a produced music video, this DVD shows you the guys as they REALLY are.  It even opens by hearing Joe Perry urinating in the toilet while he is talking to Steven about a song they are working on.  It is clear that this is just an &quot;ordinary&quot; recording day for the guys.  No stage make-up, no theatrics for the camera .. just the intricate thought process that goes into creating a work of art.As a bonus, you do get to see two &quot;finished&quot; numbers .. &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot; and &quot;The Other Side&quot; and you appreciate them so much more having seen how every note was laid down -- all the way down to the background speaking noises for their videos or &quot;opening clips&quot; before songs.Before I saw this DVD, I was a huge Aerosmith fan ... but I really only knew background info on the two &quot;stars&quot; .. Steven and Joe Perry.  I was very pleased to get to learn more about the other three members of the band and how they all contribute to the workings of the &quot;machine&quot;.I highly recommend this DVD to anybody who is interested in HOW the songs are created.

816420,"THE HUMAN STAIN met a mixed reaction when released in the theatres, possibly because the issues, which imbue this film with particular significance, got lost on the large screen that by nature concentrates on the BIG effect.  But on the DVD, viewed in the privacy of the home, the degrees of subtleties are more pronounced.  The indelible stain that birthright makes on our lives is examined in many facets in this adaptation of Philip Roth's rather sensational novel by the same name.  What effect does ethnicity have on molding our lives, what effect does the potential that inherited wealth will play on our view of the world, what effect can public prejudice as well as self-induced prejudice have on the way we process our adulthood roles?  This film addresses all of these issues: a Caucasian-appearing African American young man opts for costuming his life as a white Jewish scholar only to be dismissed from his professor's position because of a perceived 'racial slur' against absent black students; a young girl from a broken wealthy family sees through the vacuous existence when molested by a stepfather and runs into a life of poverty and personal tragedy desperately needing affection; a young writer becomes a recluse after the success of a first novel out of fear of flying; a visceral man enters madness induced by self-imposed exile.  Characters such as these put great demands on actors and it is very much to the credit of the screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and  director Robert Benton that the services of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Wentworth Miller, Anna Deavere Smith along with a fine supporting cast were captured to bring pulsating life to this difficult intermixing of stories.  Watch this one several times for the varying aspects of success in acting, in dialogue, and in the beautiful cinematic effects achieved in this very worthwhile film.",The Human Stain
415810,"Not a great film but one of those films I grew up with and have a great deal of affection for. A piece of pure postwar escapism based on a best-selling novel (or part of it anyway), it has adventure, romance, action, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Cortes expedition to conquer the Aztecs - a historical period sadly neglected by Hollywood. No doubt many of the film's attitudes would be considered politically incorrect today but, at the time, this was entertainment on a grand scale.Tyrone Power plays the title role (at another studio, it could just as easily have been Errol Flynn) and it is one of the better performances from this star who was not always very animated. But here he is properly noble or romantic or swashbuckling as the occasion demands. Almost acting him off the screen is the fiery and luscious Jean Peters as a passionate gypsy girl. It is worth watching the film for her alone. The rest of the casting ranges from adequate to strange - Lee J Cobb in particular looks lost in a period piece. Cesar Romero makes a larger than life Cortes with a equally large grin.The style of the film is colorful, well-paced and workmanlike without being burdened with a surfeit of imagination. The early scenes set in Spain look like standard Hollywood back lot/plywood sets stuff. But once the action shifts to Mexico - and this part of the film, unusually for the time, was made on location - it becomes a totally different and visually impressive movie. It really does feel like a New World.Adding immeasurably to the atmosphere is the music of Alfred Newman - one of the finest scores for a film of this type ever composed. The stirring march from the film's finale - Conquest - has become famous in its own right. But the rest of the score is just as good, especially the haunting Catana love theme - so unlike the usual Hollywood love music and so perfectly appropriate to the mood of this film. For anyone not in love with Jean Peters, Newman's music is another good reason for seeing this picture.The storyline is fairly routine with the usual predictable complications and one or two nice twists. It doesn't always make sense. Jay Silverheels (TV's Tonto) plays an Indian who, at the beginning of the film, escapes from slavery in Spain and is helped by Tyrone Power. Later, he re-appears in Mexico, re-established as a tribal chief. But I have never been able to figure out how he got there - it's not like there was a regular transatlantic passenger service in those days. But the plot rattles along at a good enough rate so that you don't worry too much about such things.A bigger budget, a better supporting cast, a more creative director (like, say, Michael Curtiz) and Captain From Castile might have been a great film - maybe even a classic. As it is, it's still pretty good entertainment and an enjoyable example of the type of film that Hollywood used to make all the time but seems to have lost the knack for. I just hope Captain From Castile eventually comes out on DVD in a restored version in all its original glory. Hint, hint...",Captain From Castile VHS
828473,"When I read about this film, I was anxious to see it.  The ideas around sexual orientation and confusion are often dealt with as comedy or simply in passing.Denied does explore these issues, and has an interesting story.  The acting is solid in most cases.  It was clearly filmed on the cheap, and it seems a decision was made to try to cover the cheap with 'art'.  Somehow, someone decided that throwing in bizarre cuts, strange noises, etc, would distract us from that problem.  Problem is, it distracts us from the story.  It can be a strain to follow, and really takes away from the story.  A better script or edit would certainly help.At the same time, it offers an interesting examination of sexuality in the context of some very believable charicters.  Worth seeing, but do not set your expectations too high -- especially if the cover has you expecting soft porn or light romantic fare.",N/A
93431,"I really liked this film when I first saw it in theatres, even as I doubted a lot of methods in which Stone draws his conclusions and retells his ""facts.""  The cast is good and, to be such a long film, it holds together.But in the years since then, a lot more has come out about the Kennedy assassination--and Stone's film.I just watched a show on the History Channel last night that completely destroys this movie's entire conspiracy theory.  It WAS possible for Oswald to get off three shots from 88 yards (and an 89-year-old man did it nearly a dozen times to demonstrate it); the fatal head shot DID come from behind the president (as shown in the autopsy); the ""magic bullet"" DID create the wounds in Kennedy and Governor Connally without turning or ""hanging in the air"" (a computer recreation showed how everyone was sitting for that to happen).Can these things still be argued?  I believe that anyone looking at all the data available now would have a hard time doing so.  But I know they will.  There's a paranoid guy at work who's passing out cheaply-made ""documentaries"" of what REALLY happened on 9-11, so crazy theories about everything will always be around.It was also disappointing to find out that Jim Garrison, the crusading attorney played Kevin Costner, was revised by Stone for his movie--and that Stone completely embellished his final speech in the film.  Garrison never said that!I don't really have much of a problem with that kind of artistic license, but only if it's acknowledged.  As long as Oliver Stone continues to insist that his version of JFK is reality, then it tends to make open-minded viewers a little squeamish.""Well, if that's not how it happened, then it should have!""That sounds more like something Michael Moore would say....",JFK Director's Cut
549873,"While I've been a longtime fan of the Woo-influenced Hong Kong action pics and I've been any even longertime (is there such a word?) fan samurai films, I've had a dubious love/hate affair with the more traditional 'martial arts' films where would-be superheroes dance on air whilst wiggling and waggling their magical swords to dice and slice the villains. I've loved CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, and I've meddled with THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR. I don't know. Something about traditional martial arts films have seemed to extremist entertainment to me ... but then along comes A MAN CALLED HERO and I find myself in a curious predicament: I'm hooked.I won't go into a massive rehash of the plot b/c the film does suffer a bit from some of the hallmarks of Hong Kong cinema: there's far too much story to be told in two hours, but, somehow, it all manages to fit together. There are a few plot points (Sword Hua's search for his sister, Hero's love-hate relationship with the Elements, Shadow's real intentions, etc.) that don't get enough screen time -- surprisingly -- but sacrifices were made, and what's left for the story is more than enough to chew.This film is dazzling to watch, and I think it so for a variety of reasons. It takes the traditional martial arts formula of the mystical hero, and it turns the film upside down to avoid going overboard in every way possible. Also, it strives to be much more of a contemporary 'period piece' -- set in what one could guess is America, circa 1920/1930 (I honestly don't remember that a date was mentioned) ... a creative choice that does give the principal characters far more of a 'superhero' feel and less of battling martial artists. That and EVERYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRITTEN ABOUT THE FILM'S CLIMAX ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY MUST BE BELIEVED! While there are a few parts of the Statue's final battle that are hard to swallow, it's easy to look the other way and just be dazzled in the way many other blockbuster films have tried to do.A MAN CALLED HERO (not to be confused with Jet Li's HERO) is a remarkable find, and it's a remarkable piece of work from a man called Andrew Lau.This is a definite owner. While parts of it are more guilty pleasure than anything else, A MAN CALLED HERO is wonderfully entertaining and even manages to tug on a few heartstrings along the way.",A Man Called Hero: Special Cut

Britain, or ""Airstrip One,"" has become part of the ultimate totalitarian super-state, ""Oceania"" - a place in which even Hitler or Stalin would feel uncomfortable! - and is ruled with an iron fist by a nameless bureaucrat, ""Big Brother.""In this nightmare dystopia the proletariat lives in grinding, hopeless poverty, it has been crushed and brutalized into mindless unthinking conformity and acceptance of anything Big Brother desires. Every waking moment, thought, action and deed is controlled and directed by the State... ""War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength."" These are the guiding principles of the Party.Oceania is in a constant state of war with either one of two other super-states, Eurasia or Eastasia. Traitors confess their sins publicly on huge view-screens, and are then executed in public, by either hanging or a bullet in the head in front of baying hysterical crowds; children inform on their parents, friends and lovers on each other.In this dismal world exists ""Winston Smith,"" a low-level functionary in the ""Ministry of Truth."" The Ministry's business is, obviously, anything but ""truth;"" Winston spends his days in a drab and soulless ""cubical farm,"" altering the past to make it conform to the Party's vision of the present. ""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past,"" is the Ministry's slogan.Winston's problem, of course, is that he KNOWS much around him is a lie, because he helps to WRITE those lies! As well as the official ""Truth,"" he also writes THE truth, HIS truth, in a diary he hides in his decrepit rat-hole apartment... just one of an endless litany of forbidden acts. In this small way, Winston starts to rebel against the State; something he knows could lead to his destruction. Events start to snowball out of control when he meets a girl, Julia, and the two of them engage in ""Sex Crime,"" a none-state sanctioned union, punishable by the severest measures.In a world of constant surveillance and betrayal, there's a heartbreaking inevitability to the lover's discovery and arrest, which moves the film into truly horrifying territory. Up `til now the story has been broadly concerned with how the State controls ""society"" as a whole, but now we see how the full might and machinery of the State is used to break the individual... the boot stamping on a human face. The film now becomes a two-hander, Winston and his interrogator, O'Brian, played by John Hurt and Richard Burton respectively.It is almost impossible to over-praise the performances of the two actors! Hurt, as Winston, is so believable, so right for the part, both physically and in his acting abilities; he makes the character come alive, so you really CARE about his fate. And Burton, as O'Brian, is a revelation. Burton was an actor who had a tendency to chew the scenery - which is not a bad thing! - and could so easily have created a monstrous, Nazi style caricature. But instead he gives a controlled and restrained performance, letting his sonorous voice create the character, and in a wondrous performance, we see the banality of true evil. In one chilling scene he even offers the hope of release to his wretched victim, telling him with a smile that, ""...in the end, we will shoot you."" This was Richard Burton's last film role, and as a swan song, I don't think he could have wished for a better part.So much of ""1984"" has become part of popular consciousness, ""Big Brother"" style surveillance, ""Thought Police,"" ""Thought Crime,"" ""Newspeak,"" ""Doublethink,"" and the ultimate horror of ""Room 101,"" that I'm sure many people think they know the story even if they've never read the book or seen the film.

826006,"There have been a decent number of zombie movies in the recent past, but -Night of the Living Dead (1995) - like the Psycho remake28 Days Later - Smart and creepy, but gets confusing and lacks much action for a story about people in an entire world of monsters (there are almost none encountered for stretches, where thousands should be nearby)Resident Evil - Considering the fact that the games were inspired by George A Romero's trilogy, and that the long epic in the game series was altered to make the movie, it was disappointingHouse of the Dead - WhateverOutside of possibly 28 Days Later, this is easily the best of those movies just mentioned, and while Resident Evil contained high production values as well, this movie had much more character, much more intensity (not quite as scary), and doesn't just have like 3 or 4 scenes with zombies in them.The action is handled not only more flashy like a modern movie, as well as faster to speed the action up - but is most importantly on a massive scale, which adds a much greater sense of reality to if such an event were to take place.  Also, while I'm not one for brutal violence in movies, humans fighting unnatural not-quite humans with extream violence adds a feeling of...sincerity to the movie.  If something comes at you to eat you, you can't just push it away, or ignore them and hope they'll go away.  The original was brutal for its time, although it's rather tame for today.  This was much more like an actual open war, with the phrase ""War is Hell"" taking a very serious meaning, as well as a sort of literal one.True, however, for a movie that strives to make as much realistic sense out of the fictional setting and circumstances, there are a few parts that shouldn't have happened, simply because I don't know if they really would happen.  Examples include some humans, only hours or days after the outbreak occurs, that treat other humans as either enemies, or hostages, and more than once, there's someone who hears a zombie behind a door, and they open it anyway.  And it never occurs to anyone that maybe just leaving the zombies trapped outside could eventually starve them out (like in 28 Days Later).  Wasn't the whole point of the mall in the first Dawn of the Dead: ""if you've found a safe haven, why would you want or need to escape?""  The characters this time around didn't quite figure that part out.The ending, like the original was abrupt, and somewhat disappointing.  While I was disappointed with the ending of the first movie, I finally figured out what makes these endings disappointing.  The 2004 earned a good ending, as with its own merits, it was a good movie; the 1978 ending was mostly upsetting because I realized that this movie, which had grown on me since I started watching, was over.  I was fine with this movie ending after only 100 minutes; I was fine with what I was given (outside of the first 30 minutes, with random killings, explosions, and a slow pace with a few bits that don't quite add up).Overall, on its own two feet, the 2004 ""equivalent"" of Dawn of the Dead stands reasonably well.  Just don't go see it without first knowing the legacy of the original, and don't expect another miracle of a horror like the ""Dawn"" before.",Dawn of the Dead
317012,"Folks, listen to me: This is the best Bond movie ever made, and Roger Moore is the best Bond. You can argue, but chew on this, Admiral Skeptic: Name one movie that Sean Connery made that had a midget, a flying car, a giant laser, and Bond threatening to blow a man's genitals off with a rifle. That's right; there aren't any. Checkmate, Connery.This film is a brilliantly surreal entry into the Bond series. It's a clear departure from Connery's films, where he had to stop the KGB from destroying the world. Moore is called in to stop an overpaid hitman and his midget from selling solar power to the UN (or something similar.) Adapted as I am for describing awesomeness, I can't begin to describe this film's grovvy factor, but I can tell you it's somewhere between ChocoTacos and regular tacos.",N/A
41383,"Best:1) It's a great example of a B-movie that became a genre classic. That alone makes it worth a look.2) It shows how black & white filming can add elements of creepiness that's hard to duplicate in color.3) It still makes you think about the possibility of ""pod people"" alien takeovers in real life (especially when one of your friends starts acting strangely).Worst:1) Although it's great 1950's fare, it's still low-budget and the acting was generally period melodrama. Older folks will appreciate it more than young people.2) Aside from a short interview with Kevin McCarthy (for a talk show sometime in the 1990's) there are no special features at all. That's a real shame for this one, being that it deserves more discussion.Recommendation:Lovers of great oldies rate this one highly for it's nostalgia value. Others, however, may find it a bit corny by today's standards. Regardless, it's a must-have for any serious sci-fi/horror movie collector.",N/A
91282,"First of all, I beg you all readers forgiveness if my usage of Christian terms are inadequate since I am not Christian.I am an animist as a Japanese, and believe in the existence of souls. So, I would say following notion is my version of amalgamation of all religious thoughts.With this remarkable film, Clint Eastwood made me think deeply about people (including myself) who have sins and are self-conscious of it, and about their lives they carry on with a burden named &quot;guilt&quot;.If you have a sin that is unforgiven, and when you are conscious of it, your life becomes a hell.You feel stained forever. That awareness suffers you.But, you have to know that you are lucky to be conscious of your sins. That means, you have a chance to save your soul, to wash the stain out by yourself. At least, you can try it. That is all our lives about, I think.William Munny, once a cold-blooded murderer, becomes conscious of his stains on his soul when he married to his late wife and she gave Munny a chance to gain a humble decency as a human.Having lost his caring wife, Munny leads difficult life with two children and poverty. But bearing this struggle is a duty to Munny to expiate his sin, or just to show his late wife he is not giving up his acquired decency.Munny's last job as a gunman, for the sake of his children, is to take revenge for a prostitute who was assaulted by two men but rejected to bring them to justice. Here, we see a typical example of injustice by the justice side in reality.Who judges who? Who can forgive someone else's sin? Nobody. Still, I would like to forgive Munny if I were in the position to make the decision. I believe Munny's wife would have felt the same.Even if the sins commited by humans never be forgiven by humans, they are always given a chance to expiate it.Humans always make mistakes. Sometimes commit sins. As a sinner myself, I cannot say that they all should be forgiven, but I believe that carrying a burden of guilty on up the steep hill towards a brighter place, however dim it seems first, is what every person with sin should do to save their souls by themselves.I say this again, but it is our lives meant that we keep moving upwards to make ourselves better. To make our world better place. However it seems hard.The good news is, the stain doesn't last forever. Because souls are the light itself. It can't be stained, after all.",Unforgiven Snap Case
157650,"Let's cut right to the chase by saying that this movie reeks, and should never be viewed by any human being. However since I'm a reviewer here it's not that easy. Sure it's a blast to make fun of and there's lots of material to work with, but this is the review on the movie itself, not how much fun you can have with it. The &quot;plot&quot;, if you can stretch the word that far, is about a wealthy man who has been wantonly destroying wildlife in the Florida Bayou finds that a swarm of murderous frogs is closing in on his own mansion habitat. Having said that, Frogs is a dumb little horror movie, and how much you enjoy it depends on your tolerance for wooden acting, silly death scenes, and lots of stock footage of reptiles and amphibians just sitting around. Since I have a since of humor, that spells F-U-N for me.:) In all seriousness however, The Crocker mansion rests on a secluded island in the middle of a swamp. After freelance photographer Pickett Smith is nearly killed while canoeing, by drunken idiot Clint, Smith is invited up to the family estate. There he meets Clint's &quot;cute&quot; sister miserable grand-pappy and about 12 other idiots who act just obnoxious enough for us to cheer when they eventually get eaten up. Even by the standard of B-movies, this one has a whole lot of blah-blah scenes. Dialogue such as ""Where's Maybelle and Grover?"" and ""What happened to Iris?"" permeate every scene. In order to best showcase the whole ""frogs"" theme, each and every sequence in the movie is followed by a shot of dozens of slimy, writhing frogs. They never really do anything, but we know they're there, just waiting. The clan has gathered at the mansion to celebrate several birthdays, drink a lot and do a lot of complaining about how `loud those damn frogs are'. Nasty old grandpa has decided to poison the frogs, but since his handyman has yet to return from the creek, it's safe to assume everyone's gonna die, and in very silly ways. Snakes hang from chandeliers, lizards take over the greenhouse, and still - the frogs watch...and wait. Now here's a shocker, are ya ready? The Frogs, curiously enough, don't commit any crimes. They are basically by standards, and do absolutely nothing to harm anybody!!!! They leave it up to their buddies to do all the dirty work, while the icky amphibians simply sit in the background, enjoying the havoc. These rich snobs get snakebit, tarantula cocooned, chomped by big turtles, sucked on by leeches, and even poisoned by the world's smartest monitor lizards. Up until the final scene, when they hop gleefully on a corpse, the frogs are merely the ringleaders. To put this into the simplest terms possible, this &quot;movie&quot; is dumb! If Frogs is a movie you plan to seek out, I certainly couldn't talk you out of it.",N/A
219293,"The Oscar-winning 1952 movie is really entertaining on a number of fronts. It is like newer form entertainment, the movie, met the challenge of traditional entertainment--circus. Cecil B Demille took such challenge of describing the circus world and make it into entertaining film. In this film a great deal of special effects as well as lots of techinics now we take it for granted in current movies were used.TRAPEZE STUNTSJust watch when the acrobatic perfromer is real actor and look-like stunts. The techinique used in this film can now be the basic of stunts.EYE MOVEMENTS OF CAMEO ACTOR/ACTRESSESThis is another challenge for Hollywood. How spectators not seeing the real act react as if they did. A number of cameo actors/actresses including child actor/actresses did the job quite well.ANIMAL ACTOR/ACTRESSESWell-trained Elephant played a key role in this movie. This movie might prompted using animals as movie actors in the movies afterward.REALITY/VIRTUAL REALITYThis movie mixes the preparation and performance of real circus and use this scene quite effectively. Mixture of reality with virtual reality is what this movie shines.SAFETY NET OR NO SAFETY NET?This is quite a big dabate for a long time. Performers might not like safety net particularly top-artist like Sebastian.But as a manager safety net is necessary for the lives of performers. This film described this age-long dilenma into drama quite well.TRAIN CRASHThis is the state-of-the-art SFX techinic at this time. It was several years before THE BRIDGE OVER RIVER KWAI. Creating such scene might be the directors' challenge in 1952.This movie lifted the art of movies into another height. Though the drama might be a bit soapy and the techinique a bit outdated. This movie still can entertain us.Recommended for classic movie fans.",N/A

92950,"There are many gangster films that rank high ratings but this one may just top them all.  We all love to see films about the bad guys and even root for them at times (what's up with that anyway?).  Martin Scorsese gives us an insider's peek at the way gangster life is.  It's full of realisms that you may not find in other crime dramas.  While this film is full of violence, it does not glorify violence but shows you what happens to those who lilve that life.  Live by the sword, die by the sword.Goodfellas could have been named The Rise and Fall of Henry Hill.  This film is based on his recollections of his former life.  You actually get to see Hill and hear him speak of those days in the special feature section of this dvd.  He does not look at all the gangster we see portrayed but looks are deceiving are they not?Paul Sorvino is positivley deadly in his role here even though you never see him lift a finger to anyone.  He states that he wasn't comfortable with the role because he wasn't sure how to portray a killer the way he needed to portray him for this film.  The outward appearance was easy but the inside of the man was more difficult.  After having dinner one night he got up to check his face in the mirror and saw a look on his face that literally made him jump back from the mirror.  It was then that he found the look of a killer he was seeking.Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci are, as usual, brilliant.  Pesci's character is especially disturbing because he is violent and 100% grade A nuts!  His best seen is probably the one in the bar when he, Ray Liotta (Henry Hill) and others are laughing and telling stories and then suddenly the mood changes on a dime just because Hill tells him that he is funny.  ""What's so funny about me?  What the @#@#@# is so funny?  Do I amuse you?  Everyone is frozen with fear because they don't know what to expect from this lunatic.  It's a very intense, powerful scene.  Finally, Hill laughs because he realizes that it's a put on and then everyone laughs.  In the special feature section it is revealed that this very same incident really happened to Pesci and Scorsese added it to the film.Goodfellas contains first rate performances from the whole cast.It's a must see for those who love the genre.Parents please be advised that this is not a movie for children.  There is a lot of violence and foul language.  I advise a viewing age of at least 18.",N/A

400925,"I would love to rate this 5 stars but I'm an equal opportunity Cher fan.  To begin with as other reviewers have remarked, this film - originally produced off Broadway by Palmienteri (who at the time was hot from &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;) does not translate as well to the screen.  The wordy script, however, gives Cher some great lines and she really carries the film.  It is a very interestingly written screenplay (it varies drastically from the original show) and once again there were rumours of trouble on the set between Cher and Mazursky, the director.  The ending and last shot is so obviously stapled on - something Cher was so angry about you can actually see her seething in the scene while she is in the car.  And she has good reason - the film reaches a crescendo and then BOOM just falls flat.  Cher's performance is wonderful and emotive; unfortunately her recently &quot;touched up lips&quot; shall I say - are hard to ignore in many scenes.  (I don't know what she did, however I rode up in an elevator with her back in February and she looked amazing).  Ryan O'Neal, as well, is bloated - so there is a desperation of the aging Hollywood actor feel about the film.  However, in an odd sense that all actually works very well with the theme of &quot;out with the old&quot; that is O'Neal's character's motivation and Cher's character's desperation as well.  A very enjoyable and underrated film.",Faithful VHS

But I had the feeling that he was seeking some compensation in treating us all to an overly generous visual exploitation of Christina Ricci's very nubile body.  Allen's films have always featured sexy women but, heretofore, with subtly and style.  It is not that ogling Miss Ricci by any means ruined my day, but it was not the kind of sophisticated fun that I am always hoping for from Woody.

In set one you get nine episodes and then five bonus features that I'm not sure of exactly what they are, I'll guess either episodes or clip montages. Then if those &quot;extras&quot; are episodes then there are fourteen episodes. Then there is the fact that they are spread out so far over four discs, that is just plain stupid! If there are nine episodes plus reterospectives then they should be on two, maybe three discs, and the same really goes if there are fourteen episodes. Next is the packaging, could it BE any worse? First all that ever changes for the front cover from each set to the next is the color, how creative! (Note:I'm being sarcastic) Then there is the box itself, it takes up so much shelf space that you might as well just own the stinkin tapes. Finally the price. Oh the price! For five bucks less I can own The Classic 39 (on only five discs by the way). The price is FAR TOO expensive, if all six sets were combined into one package onto fewer discs and with the price given, maybe even a little more, this set would be more exceptable. What it all comes down to is that I and many others are content with The Classic 39 on DVD. I can honestly live without this, and I'm a rather large fan of the show. MPI, who released this, needs to shape up and when I see all six boxed sets condensed and put into one set at a reasonable price then I'll shell out the cash for this.

801089,"I vaguely remember seeing this film on Continental Video in the mid 80's and considered it OK.  I puchased the original movie poster a couple of years ago and then went on a quest to find a VHS copy of it.  No luck.  Then I heard about Retromedia and Fred Olen Ray Along with &quot;The EEL&quot; decided to do the 20th Anniversary eddition.  I bought it.  Basically Fred Olen Ray had to go through hell trying to piece together a print to Scalps.  Most of the footage shown is grainy from a blow up of a 16mm print to 35.  The cut scenes that were added in are from a Vidoe transfer from the 80's U.S. VHS release and Canadia 3 quarter inch tapes.  Watch the movie once through and please forgive the grain.  The viewing may seem like the film is over 2 hours because it drags and drags on.  The best scene is the throat slashing.  In my opinion it is one of the best throat slashings I have ever seen on film.  I had some time to kill and decided to view Scalps once again with the commentary track on by Lee and Fred.  The commentary is great.  I learned information about the making of a film.  From script writing to finding financing.  The commentary taught me a lesson on filmmaking.  How to make a film with no budget and the tricks to shooting with what you got.  Fred Olen Ray explains about shooting day for night, shoestring budgets, how 21st century cheated him out of $ and the secrets to some special effects that were used for the murder scenes.  I recommend the viewer to watch the film once without commentary then watch it with the commentary.  The movie is not great, the image is grainy and poor but the make-up and gore is pretty good.  The commentary is the best.  Fred's voice over is much louder than Lee's but Fred is much more fun to listen too.  3 stars for gore and commentary.",Sca

It just fades from your mind. The only images I'm left with is blurry grey shifting cuts from the extended car chase in a seemingly miraculously resistant taxi and Matt Damons wrinkled forehead and perpetually pouting features.The &quot;shaky camera&quot; style that is taking over hollywood cinema is not just used in this movie, it features in it. It takes the reigns and drives it right over the cliff that is mediocrity. This movie is so hard on your eyes that you find yourself thinking about how hard it is on your eyes and not the movie. Audience withdrawal is not a way to create tension or suspense. Also, the rapid fire cuts and unfocused camera work makes you realize how little you actually see. What is meant to appear as a colossal and destructive car chase boils down to lots of tiny flashes that could be in all reality, bumper cars in an alley.The plot had all the forward motion of a beached whale. yeah, its kinda cool, but why'd the whale decide to leave the fabulous ocean for a gritty beach and what are we gonna do with it now that its here?*SPOILER*They kill off Bourne's only friend/lover right off the bat- supposedly to give him motivation to fight kick and scratch his way to the truth... the painfully obvious, heavy handed, and slow moving truth...

108857,"Directed by Harold Ramis and first released in 1980, this film has since developed a following of faithful and devoted people who never seem to tire of seeing their favorite scenes again and again and again. Everything gets off to a lively start, thanks to Kenny Loggins' singing of ""I'm Alright."" Most of the film is alright also. Rodney Dangerfield (as the rich and vulgar real estate developer Al Czervik) dominates every scene in which he appears as does Bill Murray (as neurotic/psychotic assistant groundskeeper Carl Spackler). In fact, they have very weak competition, with the possible exception of Ted Knight (as Judge Smails) for whom Czervik immediately becomes an infuriating nemesis. Ramis and his collaborators on the screenplay apparently could not decide on a primary plot so there really is none; rather, at least three different story lines, with the adversarial conversations between Smails and Czervik generating the most laughs. Spackler has his own adversarial relationship (with gophers) which also generates some sight gags. Meanwhile, Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) cannot obtain a caddy scholarship without self-important Judge Smails' approval and assistance. Meanwhile, Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) wanders in and out of various scenes with no apparent purpose in mind. Dangerfield's Czervik really is the gravitational center of the plot; the film generally sags when he's off-camera. I am not nearly so eager to see Caddyshack again as so many others obviously are but I certainly appreciate its best moments and wish there were more of them.",N/A
612051,"I'll admit that I allowed myself to get hype-tanned before I saw this collection of mildly amusing scenes cobbled together into a movie about assimilation and family conflicts within a middle-class Indian family in London.You know the works. Girl figures out she is good at soccer. Wants to do something about it. And thus we get trapped in a redundant cycle of: Jess lies to mother about playing for the team, mother finds out, Jess stops playing, Jess starts playing, Jess lies to her mother, mother finds out.....ad infinitum.See where this is going? It's quite dull and painfully repetitive, leaving us to count down the minutes until the plot reruns itself for the umpteenth time.When the plot's not stuck in its loop, it's busy cramming in limp situations and characters. Jess' family is presented as a near-exaggeration that makes the parents of My Big Fat Greek Wedding look downplayed. Not just the Indian family, even the mother of Jess' british friend, played by Juliet Stevenson, is convinced that push-ups bras and short skirts, not shin pads and cleats, are the only way to attract a man. Both families feature the old standby of Lone Understanding Parent -- trusting, sympathetic dads -- who both exist merely to convince their grumbling spouse to give the kids a break, but only, of course, in time for the Big Finish.On the plus side, the director succeeded in evoking a workable level of charm from the cast and the roles they play, and it's easy to see why so many people have come to like this film.  It's hard not to like these characters.  Plus, both Nagra and Knightley have the good looks, natural charisma, and honest acting talent that makes a person a bona fide movie star. The soundtrack is cool too except for that Punjabi music at the wedding that played on for a tad too long.Yet, on the whole it winds up being a formulaic mess, not very rousing, not very interesting, and at the end of it all, not all that much fun.

598609,"""Spirited Away"" is the only Miyazaki film I've had the good fortune to see in the theaters. After winning an Academy Award, the movie enjoyed a re-run. I hadn't heard much about it, other than the occasional television ad, where even the briefest snippet of the film convinced me this was something I had to see.Sitting in the theater, I felt like a child. The animation is superlative. Every bit of color and texture jumps out at one. The care which which this film was made is absolutely astounding!Miyazaki's dream-like story follows a young girl, Chihiro, moving to a new town with her parents. Her father, on the way to their new home, mis-directs them, and the family finds themselves at a failed amusement park, where the parents decide to explore, much to Chihiro's dismay.After wandering a bit, the parents find a food stall filled to overflowing with freshly cooked delicacies. They tuck in immediately, but Chihiro won't have anything to do with it. As the sun sets, a startling thing happens, and Chihiro finds herself in a world populated by spirits. She alone can save her parents and return them - along with herself - to the world she is used to.Miyazaki's movies tend to have a dream-like quality to them, with the possible exception of ""Princess Mononoke"" (at least, the Miyazaki films I have seen so far). ""Spirited Away"" is definitely no exception, being the most dream-like of them all. While all the occurrences in the story don't always make sense in an everyday sort of way, Chihiro's experiences in the spirit world are easy enough to relate to.There is just so much going on in this film: Chihiro's sense of loneliness, the unpredictable nature of the spirits she meets, the different laws that apply to the spirit world. ""Spirited Away"" is an assault on the senses from start to finish.I highly recommend watching the film both in the dubbed English and then in the subtitled Japanese. The differences that the characters' tone of voice convey are delightful. This is most notable in the character of Yubaba, voiced beautifully in the English by Suzanne Pleshette (and by Nina Hagen in the German version....her daughter, Cosma Shiva, plays Lin, Chihiro's boss at the bathhouse).A must see for all fans of Miyazaki's work.",N/A

20819,"SLC Punk! (James Merendino, 1999)Matthew Lillard, in the main, makes mediocre movies. So when I stumble upon something like The Curve or SLC Punk!, I find myself pleasantly surprised. The boy IS capable of acting, he just doesn't seem to do it all that often.SLC Punk! is the deceptively simple tale of two punks, Stevo (Lillard) and Bob (indie film favorite Michael Goorjian) trying to survive in the counterculture of perhaps the country's most boring metropolis, Salt Lake City, Utah. Professing a belief in anarchy and a general confusion about such heavy topics as drugs, the opposite sex, and what punk really is, the two, coupled with various fringe players, spend long hours cooking up ways to take down the system without ever actually doing so. That is, when they're not partying.While Lillard and Goorjian are the centerpieces, some of the fringe roles are just as well-acted and engrossing. Star Trek cutie Jennifer Lien plays Stevo's on-again off-again soulmate, while Bob falls in love with X-Files' Annabeth Gish. Christoper McDonald, forever branded with the stigma of having played Tappy Tibbons in Requiem for a Dream, does a minor but wonderful turn as Stevo's dad. James Duval, Summer Phoenix, Devon Sawa, and a host of others all also pop up in minor roles.Like its main characters, the movie seems to have no direction at first, but ends up being more than just your typical slice-of-life flick. There is meat to these bones, and it's quite fine. Recommended for more than just the novelty of seeing Matthew Lillard actually act, for once. *** ",N/A
454505,"I want to start out by saying Sherman Alexie is probably one of the greatest writers of our time.  When I say &quot;greatest writers&quot; I don't mean &quot;greatest NATIVE writers&quot; or &quot;greatest writers of COLOR,&quot; I mean Greatest Writers.  Mr. Alexie manages to capture the most universal emotions (grief, joy, heartbreak, anguish) and make the excessible to all, yet he also brings his own unique flavor, style and ironic wit to the mix so we are never bored.  I can honestly say that Smoke Signals is one of those films that is really dear to my heart for many reasons, and the screenplay by Alexie definitely is one of the contributing factors.For starters, there are so many classic lines in this film.  The first being that line I used as the subject for this review.  &quot;It is a good day to be Indigenous.&quot;  I don't think we hear that everyday!  The negative view of native people even today is really disturbing, and I think when people regardless of background see the portrayal of indigenous people in films, television shows, literature and education it continues to horrify and astound us all.Secondly, the story is a wonderful and important one that I think everyone can relate to.  It touches on the theme of fathers and the relationship with their children.  Victor (Adam Beach) is an bitter, angry and distrustful young man who grew up on the Coeur D'Alene &quot;Rez&quot; with his bespectacled friend/nemesis Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams). These young men are growing up in a culture separate from mainstream white culture--a culture they eventually leave when they go to retrieve the ashes of Victor's deceased father.  What starts out as a road trip turns into something more significant than either of them could've imagined.  It becomes ceremonial, and a real opportunity for maturity that changes their relationships with each other and themselves.Finally, the acting is wonderful.  The lead actors are engaging, believable and sympathetic.  The supporting cast is strong and they really capture the essence of Alexie's novels.  When I read TONTO AND LONE RANGER FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN (specifically the short story, &quot;This is What It Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona,&quot; which the film was based on), the way I envisioned the characters (how they would look, how they would talk, etc) matched the image exactly!Take it from me, a Sherman Alexie fan and self-proclaimed &quot;culture vulture&quot;.....this film is all that and a stack of fry bread!",Smoke Signals VHS
137459,"Though director Tobe Hoooper has had more downs than ups in his career, his film Lifeforce comes out being one of his best, following only Texas Chainsaw Massacre adn Poltergeist. Though initially a box-office failure, I found Lifeforce to be a refreshing story in the otherwise repetitive Science Fiction genre. That's whats sad about the genre; when filmmakers come out with somehting new and different, it flops, but if it's another ALien rip-off, box-office hit. This ""vampire"" story takes a new turn on the vampire myth, with aliens arriving on Earth that drain people of ""lifeforce,"" the essence of life. I found most of the performances to be great, espiceally Peter Firth as British Agaent Kane. He makes this film totally believable. Steve Railsback is actually the weakest in the cast, but I have to hand it to him, he had a difficult role to play and he did a credible job at it. The effects are also very good for the time and the filmmakers use their fairly high budget to their addvantage. The one thing I hate about this film is that all people seem to recognize is the nudity. They forget about the story and focus on Mathilda May's body (though she I will say she does have a great body). This film goes far beyond the nudity. It drives me nuts when I ask someone if they've seen Lifeforce and they respond ""is that the film with that hot naked chick?"" So look beyond the nudity and find and marvel at the very creative story aided by the mesmerizing score by Henry Mancini and the London Symphony Orchestra. I found the film very good all the way through . Some seem to think the film fizzles out towards the end when London is in anarchy with zombies running around but I myself found it very exciting and the zombie scenes rivel those of even George Romero. One downfall is that the film fails to explain the relationship between the female space vampire and Steve Railsback very well, but overall this is the most refreshing sci/fi film that I have seen in years.TRIVIA: The original U.S. theatrical and VHS release portrays a different opening title sequence.

596080,"...this being a Spielberg movie, I was just cringing in anticipation of his inevitable schmaltzy happy Hollywood ending to a surprisingly (for him) thought-provoking and unpredictable film.  Those rather un-Spielbergian qualities mainly come from the fact that ""Minority Report"" is based on a short story by the heavyweight postmodern writer Phillip K. Dick, who also wrote the book from which the classic existentialist-sci-fi film ""Blade Runner"" (directed by the relatively schmaltz-free Ridley Scott) was adapted.And true to form, Spielberg doesn't disappointment---our hero seems to be defeated, only to be rescued and rise from the ashes of his apparent destruction to rid us of the Insidious Bad Guy, and closes out the movie back in the saddle with his Major Romantic Interest who's shown growing a belly about the size of a Volkswagen just before the final credits, which are of course accompanied by the Designated Uplifting And Bombastic Orchestral Score of John Williams.Now that you know the usual Spielbergian/Hollywood focus-group-bootlicking ending---and to its credit, this ending is not immediately apparent during the FIRST ten minutes of the movie, unlike most Hollywood blockbusters---you can sit back and enjoy the first 95% of the film.  Spielberg gets to go beserk with all sorts of technological gizmos since this film is of course set in the future, and there are a couple of somewhat original action/fight scenes to keep us entertained throughout.What makes the film more than the usual Hollywood puke of brainless special effects showboating but actually INTERESTING however, is the plot and subtext as supplied by Phillip K. Dick---which is to say, the conflict between technology, humanity, and metaphysics.  This being a Spielberg film it never gets anywhere as dark and disturbing as Dick's work usually is, unfortunately.  But there is still enough Dick in there to outweigh the worst of Spielberg, at least until the last 5 minutes which I recommend you watch while drinking copious amounts of alcohol or some other brain-deadening activity.Just makes you wonder how much better this film could've been, in the hands of a director like Ridley Scott or Terry Gilliam.  Oh well, at least Spielberg didn't excrete another God-forsaken schmaltz-orgy like his recent ""The Terminal.""",N/A
11849,"I have seen this masterpiece many many times, but only after reading T.E. Lawrence's book &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; this year do I now begin to understand. This movie is a product of two of the century's greatest minds, one an author and soldier, the other a film maker. The power of Lawrence's descriptions of the desert matches the great cinematography. No film could fully project the power of the inner thoughts of this most introspective man; for that you absolutely need the book to fill in the gaps. Many of the scenes take on a much deeper meaning once you have read the book in detail. The Columbia Tri-Star two-DVD edition is faultless, something I will always treasure. I find it hard to believe that someday a better movie could possibly be made, but we can hope against hope.",N/A

He showed genius in winning the love of his life, in protecting his son from the cruelty of others and in sacrificing himself for his son.  Is slapstick appropriate for the subject ?

156903,I first encountered Care Bears when my baby sister started watcing them even though they've been around in my time. I have to say they're really addicting to watch. She loves them and has about 30 of them which she plays with them by having a Care Bear Conference and it's no suprise she loves this movie. I've always been a fan of Mickey Rooney and he was wonderful in this film. This story follows the care bears as they battle an evil spirt who has tricked a boy named Nicolas into destroying all the caring in the world. They encounter the care bear cousins as they search for the two remaining children who care in the world. The story teaches lids about caring and loving and it is a great movie for children. My only problem with this movie is that they change the story in the next movie but overalll it is a must buy and your kids will want to watch it again and again.,N/A

One thing that I like about this movie is that it is artistically different from all the others.  It is very bold and bright.  The voice casting is great, as well as the animation.  The computer effects are also really good.  The elements add up to a funny Disney film that is worth seeing.",N/A
502054,"I had to chuckle to myself when I noticed I am following up a review for a movie called ""Killer Condom"" with one for a film called ""Inseminoid."" It is completely unintentional, I assure you. Still, it is funny in a dark, demented sort of way. As for these two films, the styles are quite different. ""Killer Condom"" is a warped spoof of American detective films while ""Inseminoid"" falls into the category of straightforward science fiction. Also known as ""Horror Planet,"" ""Inseminoid"" is one of those hypercheesy rip-offs of ""Alien,"" except on this outing it is Brits instead of Americans working on both ends of the cameras. The movie is a very low budget effort, hardly worth mentioning let alone watching unless you always enjoy viewing low budget British ""Alien"" rip-offs. Once again, I found myself wondering how a movie like this could get a DVD release while worthier projects fester on the back shelves of video stores in VHS formats. I am not saying ""Inseminoid"" is bad; it is actually a quite enjoyable romp through the world of schlock cinema, but even I must admit this movie should stand at the back of the line when it comes to receiving a DVD treatment.On some distant planet in the distant future, an archeological expedition made up of males and females digs up a world of hurt in a series of tunnels near their recently inhabited base. One of the guys nosing around in a tunnel unearths some weird looking crystals, and goes completely bonkers after touching them. The other members of the expedition express the requisite amount of concern for their mentally damaged and recently deceased co-worker, but that doesn't stop them from continuing to muck around in a situation of increasing danger. Instead of hiding away in the research facility to await the arrival of a rescue ship, the crew decides to find out exactly what is going on. Too bad for them. It turns out that some mushroom shaped alien life form (see the cover of the DVD) has decided to emerge from its hibernation, hiding place, or wherever it has been in order to wreak havoc on the gullible humans. The hideous being hurts a few people before casting its lascivious eye on Sandy (Judy Geeson), deciding to ""inseminate"" her (chuckle) so he can have a few children. Before you groan with derision, and you will groan often while watching the film, it is after this incident that ""Inseminoid"" gears up to a snail's pace.Sandy flips her lid after her experience with the creature. ""Hey, so would I if I just had a sexual experience with an alien"" you might say, and you would be right in part until you discover what Sandy gets up to. She starts roaming around the byzantine tunnels of the research facility in search of her fellow crewmembers because the growing embryos inside clamor for the nurturing taste of human blood. Bodies fall spouting blood and guts as Sandy insidiously tracks down her prey. The lady uses explosives to blast through metal doors, lays in ambush, acts as though she is in peril in order to lure unknowing humans to her, and generally makes a huge nuisance of herself. A diminishing group of survivors frantically monitors the deteriorating conditions in the corridors of the base from a sealed off control chamber while desperately hoping help arrives in time. Predictably, Sandy gives birth to her alien offspring--twins, by the way--before finally succumbing to one of her comrades. The ""twist"" ending not only fails to surprise, it fails in an excruciatingly banal way. Anyone who claims ""Inseminoid"" doesn't rip-off ""Alien"" should have their head examined.""Inseminoid"" boasts several memorable elements worth noting here. One concerns the presence of actress Victoria Tennant among the cast. She only shows up briefly--just long enough to pick up her paycheck, one supposes--so you have to keep your eyes open. The idea that this actress could go from a cheesefest like ""Inseminoid"" to movies like ""All of Me"" in the space of three years simply boggles the mind. Only Kim Cattrall could boast of a similar seismic shift in cinematic priorities with her trek from ""Porky's"" to ""Sex in the City,"" and that took nearly twenty years. If you tire of looking for Tennant, tide yourself over with the hysterical overacting from Judy Geeson's character. Bette Davis near the end of her career couldn't beat this energetic actress's hammy performance as the doomed Sandy. She shrieks, she cries, she bellows, she cackles, she plots--what a thespian! I alternated from saying things like ""Oh, knock it off!"" to general laughter as I watched Geeson emote herself into a tizzy. Yep, these two elements, combined with set pieces that looked like they were taken from a roller rink circa 1975 and the cheesy special effects make ""Inseminoid"" a worthwhile project for the dedicated film fan.The DVD edition doesn't offer much in the way of extras. There's a grainy, unrestored trailer and that's about it. At least they offered us a widescreen picture transfer (why, I have no idea), which does look very nice. The audio sounds better than it should. ""Inseminoid"" is rumored to cause watering eyes, chronic fatigue syndrome, shingles, projectile nasal congestion, headaches, and a host of other annoying ailments to those who watch it more than once. So take my advice: rent the film, watch it once very quickly, and return it with all due haste to the video store. There's no sense causing yourself lingering harm by repeating the experience.",Inseminoid: aka Horror Planet

613804,"I have seen this movie twice and found it even funnier the second time around.  I am sure that had to do with the fact that the first time, I didn't realize Jack Sparrow's character was based loosely on Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones.  Johnny Depp does an amazing job.  I think because of his good looks, no one gives him the credit he deserves as an actor.  He's so smooth in this.  He didn't even have to speak to make the film funny.  He was Jack Sparrow.  Should he get the oscar?  It's hard to say because I haven't seen the other movies to compare. He should definetely get acknowledged in some way because his take on Jack Sparrow and his acting, were phenonmenal.  On another note, the filming was incredible.

220089,"Martin Ritt has a central theme that he explores in almost every film he makes. What unites and seperates us? He's become the master of that extremely difficult question and this film, for my money, was one of his best explorations of that theme/question.It's about the workers and the company- 'the ones who push up or push down- who has more push?', as Connery's character sums up. It's about the choices people make to get up, get ahead or to get out. Ultimately, it's about compromised positions and consequences that come from such compromise.Connery and Harris are terrific in this movie- the two sides of the coin. Harris has the tough role as the detective 'sent in' who struggles with both sides of the coin. Connery (just as his Bond days were coming to an end), does a slow boil to a funeral scene where he lets it rip. His dad was a soft spoken Irishman, he once said in an interview. I swear he vented something wonderful about the meek and good in this world, in this scene, that rocks with truth. "" They haven't even left him with a proper suit to be buried in! "" Watch him in this- one of Connery's finest performances.Mancini captures the Irish flavour with a terrific score and Samantha Edgar and Frank Finlay and Anthony Zerbe lend their talents, as well.Another buried treasure that deserves the sunlight.

247126,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***This is a very underrated movie. As one who does a bit of re-enacting, the idea of time-traveling is an exciting thought. Of course, we all know that travel through time is impossible, at least in the way that the movies portray it. But re-enacting does give one the opportunity to experience the closest thing we have to time-traveling, and yet remain in the modern world as well.That's kind of like The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan. She can come and go through time as she pleases, and once she figures this out, she uses this ability to find the kind of life she's been longing for, including true love. (Many of the other reviews here have already given the synopsis of the story).A chick flick? Yeah...it is. But, it seems most guy flicks do not deal with this subject with the reverence that the chick flicks do, although there are excellent examples of what can be done to please both sexes when they put their mind to it, such as The Final Countdown (guy orientd, but my wife and my mother both love this movie), Frequency (not really time travel, per se, but still in that catagory), and Kate & Leopold (a movie for everyone!). The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan is closer to Somewhere In Time and The Love Letter when it comes to time-travel movies. There's a realistic quality to Jennie's reaction when she finds herself, at first unknowingly, transported to the past. We all feel her confusion and fright at her experience. But then, once she has realized what was happening and what she was able to do, she takes baby steps in her exploration of her portal to another time, pandora's box now opened.The movie plays out with a realistic tone, and the ending leaves the viewer without a sense of loss. Actually, the ending to this movie is perfect.Now, like the other reviewers, I'd like to know where the DVD of this movie is.

And he really is.There are already plenty of synopses in the other reviews, so I won't repeat the story here.  I do want to say that this is not a film that is ugly for ugliness' sake.  It is a movie about a man from certain social stratum trying, and failing, to deal with faliure.  He is filled with hatred, for himself and for everyone else.  The most interesting thing is, as I listened to him spew his bile, I couldn't help but nod my head now and then.  The Butcher has moments of insight, and you can tell that Noe empathizes with his character, because he proves him right again and again.  I even found myself forgiving our protagonist's racism and homophobia - because it was so obviously misdirected anger.  He is brimming over with anger and self-hatred and, I'll admit it, I felt very sorry for the poor [illegitimate].I only spent so much time on my half-assed analysis because I feel that Noe's films are misunderstood.  They are nihilistic, but so what?  They both honestly explore some aspects of the human experience that most humans don't want to think about.  And I think they are fascinating.Irreversible is a better film, but this one is my favorite.  Noe is a genius.",I Stand Alone
622373,"KILL BILL VOL 2Kill Bill Vol. 2 continues the trail of revenge killings by Uma Thurman's character- The Bride- whose name is finally revealed. Both Vol. 1 and 2 were originally intended and filmed to be one movie. The benefits of this are similar to those in ""The Lord of Rings"" trilogy in that there is a real sense of continuity in the scenes and cinematography that might have been absent if this was filmed years later as a sequel.Once again Tarantino pulls no punches. There are references and tips of the hat to the seveneties, martial arts movies and a dozen TV themes. This is a feast for moviegoers.If you didn't see Vol. 1 you will be at a disadvantage although there is a small recap at the beginning. Vol. 2 does tone the violence down in favor of more dialogue, especially in the final scenes between John Carradine's character and The Bride.Darryl Hannah plays California Mountain Snake to perfection as a diabolical homicidal one-eyed killer who turns on her own kind. Also great is Michael Madsen as the loner/loser Budd aka Sidewinder who almost comes across as a sympathetic everyday loser as he waits for his fate. Not to be missed is the chilling chapter 'The Lonely Grave of Paula Schultz' where Uma Thurman is buried alive and must reach back into past to survive.Packed with pop culture references, martial arts violence and cinematic flourish Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a great finish to one of the best film stories of the decade and quiet possible, of the last fifty years.

Kentis and Lau pulled it off perfectly, especially given the unbelievably horrific predicament the two main characters were in.  So what if most of the scenes involve the two main characters having a dialogue while treading water.  What do you expect from a low budget indie?  They got the most mileage they could out of their resources, and yet retained believability and fear via a gamut of human emotions displayed in the main characters. 'It's the fear stupid'... and the existential mind numbing horror of their unique situation drove home the feelings of despair and angst generated in the viewer who empathized with them.

The jump to menu scene's and interactive menu's are absolutely incredible. They even have jump to nightmare available as well.

810624,"War is terrible. What an understatement! Today, with high tech weaponry, and a news media careful of viewers' sensibilities, it is difficult to understand, in the gut, how much horror is involved in war - unless, of course, we lose a loved one. And the War Between The States, which destroyed a generation, was one of the most terrible.""Cold Mountain"" opens with scenes from the 1864 Siege of Petersburg. The footage portrays the brutal effects of explosions, with the resulting burning violence which tears men's bodies to pieces. The chaotic battle scenes, the blood, filth, mindlessness and terror of close combat, are some of the most realistic I have ever seen. Just before the battle, confederate soldier Inman, (Jude Law), receives a letter from his beloved, Ada, asking him to come home to her. ""Mr. Inman,"" she writes, ""If you are fighting, stop fighting. If you are marching, stop marching. Come home to me, please. This is my request. Come home to me."" Weary, after years at the front, and badly wounded after the siege, he escapes from a field hospital and begins his odyssey home to Cold Mountain, NC....and to Ada, whose image has accompanied him for long years, and ""prevented him from falling into a darkness."" He treks across the war ravaged land, meeting murderous men from both North & South, who want to ""put him in the ground."" Along the way, he is sometimes nursed and cared for by desperately lonely women left behind. But his goal is always Ada and Cold Mountain.Ada Monroe, (Nicole Kidman), a southern belle from Charleston, moved to Cold Mountain along with her father, a minister, (Donald Sutherland), shortly before war broke out. Both Inman & Ada were too shy and inexperienced to express their growing feelings toward each other until he marched off, amongst friends & flags, to fight for glory. The two were finally able to communicate their emotions. Although the couple had spent little ""real time"" together, sometimes a look, a gesture, a few words of mutual understanding, can form a bond which days, hours and minutes cannot. Time to live and love, a most precious commodity, is a reoccurring theme throughout the film. When Ada's tells her father that she and Inman only spent a brief period together, he responds, ""I lost your mother after 22 months of marriage. It was enough for a lifetime.""When Ada's father dies, she struggles to survive alone, with no money, in a town where all able-bodied men have gone to war. She was educated to be an accomplished lady, not to work a farm. Then Ruby, (Renee Zellweger), a tough talkin' woman-of-all-trades enters, to help out. Zellweger is extraordinary as an abused woman with a hard shell surrounding a sensitive soul and a kind heart. As cliched as this role sound, Zellweger is an original - a real scene stealer.Kidman is luminous as Ada, and Jude Law's is wonderful in his portrayal of Inman, the intense young man, painfully disillusioned but determined to survive. Gabriel Yared's wonderful, frequently melancholy folk music from the Civil War period, adds beauty and authenticity. Bring tissues - this is a real tearjerker! Bravo to director Anthony Minghella who remains true to Charles Frazier's excellent novel of the same title! Highly recommended!JANA",Cold Mountain VHS
733270,"Lucia is a waitress in Madrid, Spain,  when something tragic happens to her boyfriend, Lorenzo, who is a writer.  This tragic event seems to be related to an island where something happened some time ago, and Lucia packs her bags and intends to visit the island.  At the island, she begins her soul-searching and determines how her relationship with Lorenzo came about.  In this manner, she noticed that she got  lost into a dark emotional roller coaster that seemed to influence Lorenzo's writing and their relationship.  As she discovers herself, she also finds out about the islands hollow structure, which serves as a symbolism for her former relationship with Lorenzo.  Sex and Lucia is obviously a well designed and written story that is brought to life through some very intimate moments.  These moments might offend some viewers, however, these shots make the film very personal to the audience.  Overall, the story is chopped up to resemble a mind in emotional turmoil which enhances the feelings that the film creates.  This film will surely offend many, however, the film also offers a truly great cinematic experience.",N/A

489128,"Farewell My Concubine spans fifty years, from traditional China in 1927 to post-Mao Zedong in 1977.  It is an unbelieveable cinematic achievement, with glorious, exquisite costumes and supreme actors.  It is the story of two boys who grow up to be stars in the Beijing Opera.  One boy plays the King, the other his concubine.  Many men played female roles with great skill, earning them great admiration and honor.Beijing Opera is a very important part of Chinese culture.  From the late 1700's until Mao's Cultural Revolution in the 60's, whole towns would thrill to the arrival of the stars.  The performance included dazzling acrobatics, sumptuous costumed court ladies, generals, gods, scholars, and warriors.  Today, Beijing Opera is not as popular.  Although it is shown on state-run Chinese television, it is difficult to compete with more modern entertainment such as movies, sports, and the Internet.  Like other ancient arts, Beijing Opera will fade away without support.  Farewell My Concubine brings it back to life in such a stunning manner, you will weep to see this art revived to it's former glory.The beginning of the movie deals with the boys' difficult childhood.  They are being trained by a master of opera.  The master's methods may seem harsh, but he really wants the best for the boys' futures.  Mostly street orphans, the master knows that the only future they may have is actors in the Opera.  However, the master cannot protect young Douzi from the pedophiliac clutches of a wealthy patron of the troupe.  These early scenes are very difficult to watch, but they set the stage for the tragic character Douzi grows up into.  Douzi's adult name is Dieyi, his friend Shitou becomes Xiaolou.Gong Li is the only actress in this male-dominated film.  She gives a great performance, per usual.  She plays a street-smart prostitute who contrives to marry Xiaolo, so she can escape life in the brothel.  There is instant, intense competition and hatred between her and Dieyi over Xiaolou.You cannot watch this movie without weeping.  It deserved the Palm D'Or it received at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.  You will have a new appreciation for Chinese culture, and especially for Chinese Opera after watching this film.  The film is long, just about three hours, but it is worth every minute.  I even wished it was longer.",N/A

357107,"This introspective film acutely addresses the tension between faith and reason. The very first scene suggests an equivalence between a person's faith and his or her involvement in ritual: pastor Tomas, in the middle of a spiritual crisis, conducts a service without much conviction. Later, Bergman will show us that only a man who has faith (the disabled church employee) can give liturgy all of its meaning. This parallel can also be extended to the main cause of Tomas' crisis: God's silence. It is this same silence that feeds the faith of that other man. While the film initially appears to emphasize the futility of faith (especially during the first church service and Tomas' ensuing conversations with his mistress and the fisherman), careful viewing points to the contrary: it is when Tomas abjures his faith that his already unstable situation deteriorates - his understated reaction to the fisherman's suicide is all the more startling since this event's consequences will prove to be crucial. And it is when Tomas listens to the employee late in the film that he finds the force to conduct a service even though no one attends it; he is conducting it for himself as a further step in his ongoing spiritual quest.",Winter Light VHS

But at the same time, kiddies and the grown-ups get a moral lesson at the end. This time, a ""don't spread rumors"" value is the case. Jr. Asparagus and Laura Carrot misunderstand a figure of speech quoted by Alfred (Archibald). Archy said that he had to ""recharge his batteries"", so naturally, Jr. and Laura think he's a robot. A talking weed hears the story, and spreads a rumor all over Bumbleyburg.

I'm just glad it's finally come to DVD!I won't get too much into the plot but it's basically a Satanic/Supernatural/Big Old English Mansion movie with a whodunnit twist. (with some very imaginative ways of people getting killed!) The film is very nicely shot, with a great music score, (sometimes a bit campy, but it was the 70's after all) and sports a great cast. The story isn't what I'd call original, but basically it's a QUALITY movie, not a cheesy slasher flick... I think this movie has stood the test of time quite well (Except for Sam's haircut and 'stache maybe!) and would still hold up today.Just seeing how Sam Elliot deals with England and it's natives (with his famous country-western demeanor) makes it worth watching!Although there's very little in the extras department (besides a VERY dated trailer) the Audio and Video quality are very nice.

722828,"Calvin Palmer has a pregnant wife, some big dreams, and a barbershop he inherited from his father and his grandfather before him that he doesn't particularly want.  Seems Calvin yearns for bigger and better things, like having his own recording studio.  But when he contracts with a local loan shark to sell the barbershop to finance his pie-in-the-sky schemes, Calvin is brought up short by the realization of how much the barbershop means to his employees, his customers and his community.  Because the local barbershop in a black neighborhood is an institution, a place where the guys can come in, kick back, trade news and views and feel at home.  Calvin realizes he's made a terrible mistake.  But how to rectify it?  The loan shark plans to turn the barbershop into a strip joint and he wants double the selling price to sell it back.  There's a lot of moving and shaking and a hysterically funny subplot involving a stolen ATM before this film reaches its conclusion.The cast is excellent all around.  Ice Cube is wonderful as Calvin, who doesn't know what a treasure his family has owned for three generations until he's about to lose it.  I thought Eve was very effective as Terri Jones, the lady barber who has had it up to here with her no-good two-timing boyfriend.  Anthony Anderson is hilarious as JD, probably the dumbest would-be robber who ever hijacked an empty ATM.  But the big draw in this film is Cedric the Entertainer as Eddie, with a leonine head of hair that looks like he stuck a wet finger in an electric socket, pontificating and philosophizing, offering up insights and chunks of wisdom that are sharp as a razor and devastatingly funny.  The movie feels totally real; we're right there inside the barbershop, kicking back along with the cast and enjoying every second.  It's a film with a lot of warmth and a lot of heart, and not a dull moment in it.  We leave this movie feeling it's life's intangibles that really count.Judy Lind",Barbershop

614961,"I'm giving the 4 stars for Ben Stiller, as I am a huge fan of his. The typical facial expressions and comedic activities were pure Ben Stiller. However, Jack Black was not an asset to this movie. The whole premise of this movie was wanting you to envision the character of Jack Black as being intelligent enough to even make it believeable that he could come up with the concept of Vapoorize in the first place. That is where this movie in my opinion, fell apart. Anyone but Jack Black would have been more believable, and funny at the same time. I even thought Owen Wilson would have been much better! Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson make a great team in any comedy! Just remember the classic Meet The Parents, Zoolander, Starky and Hutch, and you can get the picture. Watch it for the comedy of Ben Stiller, but try to imagine someone else playing the other part. Jack Black is just too annoying for my taste.",Envy
820180,"There are bad movies and there are so-bad-they're-good movies.  In the `50s and `60s, there were a lot of these latter sorts to be found in that subgenre of film know as the monster movie.  Poorly written, with special effects that were not very special, they had often had a perfect combination of earnest seriousness and complete cheesiness that made them somehow amusing on an unintended level.  The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is a largely successful attempt to deliberately make one of these ""bad"" movies.The story deals with a scientist and his wife who have gone to a remote cabin while searching for a meteor filled with ""atmospherium,"" an extremely rare element with wonderful properties.  Meanwhile, an alien spacecraft makes a forced landing nearby; the occupants need atmospherium to refuel their ship; they also need to retrieve their pet mutant, who has escaped and is now mutilating people.  Finally, there is the mad scientist who needs the atmospherium to resurrect the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, who - when reanimated - will be able to take over the world.Everything, from the opening credits to the final ""The End?"" is played straight as if this really were an old-time monster movie.  Most of the time this is pretty clever and amusing, although at times, it wears a little thin, like one of those Saturday Night Live sketches that runs a bit too long.  Overall, however, this is a fun movie - a solid four stars - and if you enjoy good parody, this is a recommended film.",The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra

(1962) and some are standard stuff.Apaches and the Wild West figure more than once in his filmography as ""Apache"" (1954) and ""Vera Cruz"" (1954).When he directed this movie he was almost ending his career and felt free to take some risks. This film is risky and gives a stern look to Apache and White Men confrontation. Many of the scenes presented are cruel and barbarous but not gratuitous. They blatantly are inquiring for ""Why this cruelty?"" and the explanation come from Ke-Ni-Tay's mouth, voicing Apache's beliefs and traditions, giving a rationale to their procedures.I've recently reviewed some films dealing with similar subject, not one of them is as bluntly direct and believable as ""Ulzana's Raid"".Aldrich's movie shows no ""Blue Coat Heroes"", no ""Native Shining Knights"". Shows just rough men immersed in a deadly confrontation trying their best to outsmart and annihilate the enemy. Yet, best human traits still emerge from this dry opus: self-sacrifice and loyalty; need for understanding and respect for the defeated.The story centers in a group of nine Apaches leaded by Ulzana, which flee San Carlos Reservation and start a raid, creating havoc and devastation in their path. A small detachment conducted by a very ""green"" Lieutenant, an old White scout and an Apache scout follow the rogue party to put an end to their ""amok run"".Burt Lancaster fleshes McIntosh with all his skill depicting a hardboiled scout having to bear the ""authority"" of the inexperienced military. Jorge Luke as Ke-Ni-Tay, Joaquin Martinez as Ulzana, Bruce Davison as Lt. De Buin and Richard Jaeckel as the Sergeant are very convincing.A tough movie to watch, not commendable for young and/or impressionable audience.

266463,"Only the genius of John Ford and the merciless pen of Steinbeck could build such powerful movie . In these hard times when the WW2 covered the whole environment and the people went to movies to get fun , Ford showed this dark nightmare about the desillusion of a crowd of hopeless people literally exiled when they are ejected from their original lands and persuaded to live in California where best times are yet to come .This realist portrait ,  sober and  moderate adaptation of the novel of John Steinbeck presents a sinister chronology of misery so painful and bitter as any other one in the American cinema . The landscape is behind of all these afflictions of the Joad and Ford carries the dusty highways and the unlimited horizons of such intensity that the loaded truck appears as a Noah Ark which takes to one or two of each generation far from a desert beated by the wind . The darkness brings uncertainity and fear . But with this premise Ford will turn the destiny and will provide of optimist hope for the new and promised land .Without any doubt , this film is one of the merciless and powerful films which deals with such theme .Far from North America , the echoes of the new ideologies shocked the world ; the utopic projects inflamed the imagination of famous writers and Steinbeck was one of them , infected for those old fashioned moods . In the Eastern World Shostakovich and Boris Pasternak ; in Europe Bertold Brecht and Kurt Weill , and in America John Dos Passos and Sinclair Lewis who had shocked the literary world with his unforgettable work : Babbit .Those were hard days , and the shadows of the war foretold dark large threatening clouds.The Manhattan Project was in full development and Walt Disney handseled Fantasy.John Ford made a curious twist in his filmography ; specially when he had thrown The stagecoach , a mythical film about the emblematic mythology of the American cinema as the Western meant. Nevertheless this picture was awarded with all the possible honors and somehow was the initial jump for a young actor as Henry Fonda who would become in one the antihero archetype along two decades in films such The Ox bow incident , 12 angry men , The wrong man .Fundamental issue in the early forties .Magistral transfer on DVD .",N/A

362029,"In the history of screen adaptations of comic books, Alex Proyas's adaptation of James O'Barr's underground comic _The Crow_ is one of the finest. I like Marvel Comics a lot and I've enjoyed most of the recent adaptations of the Marvel catalogue. But in comics-to-screen-land, I have _three_ favorite Lees: Stan, Ang, and the late Brandon.(Brandon Lee, as most visitors to this page will already know, died tragically as this film was being produced. That's a terrible loss and it adds an even darker edge to an already dark film.)Alex Proyas, who would later give us the haunting noir-SF _Dark City_, here turns his directorial hand to bringing _The Crow_ to (heh heh) life. The film recalls all the best elements of Tim Burton's first _Batman_ film and, I think, outdoes its predecessor by quite a bit.You probably already know the plot here. Rock musician Eric Draven (d'Raven; get it?) and his fiancee Shelly Webster are brutally murdered on Devil's Night (the night before Halloween). Exactly one year later, Draven returns temporarily to life in order to exact revenge on the thugs who murdered them. Which he does, very stylishly.Dressed in Goth black and with his face painted white, he comes across as something like a vampire, something like a one-man combination of Batman and the Joker, and something like the old comic book hero the Spectre (remember? murdered policeman Jim Corrigan returned from the dead?). The whole thing is calculated, in the old Batman phrase, to strike terror into the hearts of evildoers, and so is Draven's remarkable healing ability: since his wounds close over just about as fast as they're formed, he's all but unstoppable.Anyway, the overarching theme is that love is eternal, but along the way we get to see a lot of dark and gratifying violence as the bad guys get what's coming to them.The cast and the script are magnificent. Of course the late Brandon Lee steals the show. But everybody else is good too, including the bird.The cinematography is brilliant. Everything is muted into almost pure black and white, with occasional touches of red. The cityscape is wonderfully realized, fitting somewhere between Burton's Gotham and Proyas's own Dark City. And it always seems to be raining. On top of all that, the entire thing is lifted high into the (night) sky by Graeme Revell's otherworldly score.If you like noir fantasy, don't miss this one.

I have to say that I was entertained, laughed my a$$ off at some points, was disturbed at others, but in a whole, the picture left me feeling empty.

By looking at her, you would not think ""boxing"" you would be thinking ballerina or perfectly fit dancer. This program uses ballet exercises that require extreme focus and control. Katalin's creativity is exceptional and her instruction style is exquisite. She introduced me to so many new moves, I can hardly describe them all. Her floor work has some beautiful exercises that will require you to have a good basic core of strength already in place.From the very start of this program I was pretty excited because after doing so many Pilates workouts, I knew most of the floor/standing moves and the focus here is on standing postures and exercises. Yet, they are exercises with a new creative twist. It is even difficult to describe the exercises because they are truly more like a standing dance. Imagine standing and then raising your leg and then moving your body in interesting directions to test your balance. I think she is mainly focusing on the ""tendu en croix"" and ""degage"" with plenty of front and back sweeps where you are standing on one leg and moving the other leg fairly quickly back and in front of you. So, that is the basis and there is a lot of center position focus. The lunges mostly go to the side or are more like a courtesy. I found that they were very easy on the knees and I could actually do them! Yes! Normally lunges are my least favorite, but these were like ""dance lunges"" which moved softly to the side.The balance element had my full attention. Unless you have been doing Yoga or Pilates for a few years, the balance exercises might really frustrate you. This is definitely not for beginners because you truly do need to know all the basic ballet moves which move at a rather rapid pace in this video.Katalin is a perfect instructor. Not only does she never make a mistake throughout the entire workout, her cues are right on target and she has a calming beautiful voice. You feel nurtured all while she seems to gently guide you into some rather intense exercises. Your mind is so intrigued with the creativity that you forget you are exercising your body into a fully body sweat.Standing Pilates Blend is Intermediate/Advanced for sure! I love it and can """"""HIGHLY"""""" recommend it to anyone who loves Pilates and wants to move to what I'd call the ""third"" level. The first being when you learn the moves. The second when you accomplish the exercises. The third when you start to get creative and take each exercise to a new level of intensity. The camera is also in motion and switches from a group exercise situation to individual segments for instruction by crashing waves or a beach scene. This is a visually interesting workout which seems to almost hypnotize you with beauty so you don't even realize you are working as hard as you are.This is a ""must-have"" workout for anyone who wants to improve their balance. It will also tone your entire body and you will feel your abs and butt tighten and lift even after just one workout if you have been working out on a regular basis.If you are just starting with Pilates, try Winsor Pilates, Karen Voight and Jennifer Kries first. Those will give you a great overview and teach you the poses and exercises you need to know to master this workout.Also highly recommended:Jennifer Kries' Pilates Plus Method: The Unique Combination of Yoga, Dance, and Pilates- a book that explains the exercises in detail and also have inspirational quotes.~The Rebecca Review",The Method - Standing Pilates Blend
705210,"Neither the 2000 television version nor the 2002 film could ever hope to match the magic, passion, dramatic heights and emotional involvement of this nine hour Royal Shakespeare Company production. All the characters and subplots of Dickens' novel are presented in a whirlwind of drama, comedy, tragedy and romance. It was a wise decision, when putting the production on film, to retain as much of its theatrical flavor as possible. Because it is that theatricality that produces as much of an impact and lasting impression as the characters and plot.Originally staged by the RSC in the early 80's at the Aldwych Theatre, this version was taped at the Old Vic before the company took the show to New York. At times, an audience is visible (and audible) especially when various characters leave the stage to wander or race through the aisles or along the front of the balcony. It must have been a wonderful experience. But the DVD compensates us for not actually being there by providing that which you cannot get in a theatre - close-ups of the actors. Only once is this overdone - when Ralph Nickleby is finally denounced, the camera lingers much too long on an extreme close-up as the other characters are only heard revealing the sins of his past. But other times, such as during the silences between lines or the looks between characters, the close-ups are quite wonderful.A cast of 30-some actors portray about 150 characters between them. Of course, doubling or even tripling is an ancient theatrical convention. But never have I seen it used as effectively as here. Only Roger Rees, as Nicholas, plays a single part. This is real acting we are witnessing.The nine hours are divided into four acts spread over three discs. Each act is divided into two or three parts, each with the same opening and closing credits. This makes it possible to watch in installments although one at a time never seems enough. My wife insisted that we watch the entire 167 minute final disc in one sitting. The time flies by.The story is typical Dickens, full of noble poor people and disreputable rich ones, with complex plotlines that would be the envy of any modern soap, complete with Dickens' famous penchant for incredible coincidences. But this is more than mere melodrama and everything about the production combines to make it all fresh and exciting and involving. These are characters you genuinely care about (or, in a few instances, love to hate). And there will not be a dry eye in the house during Smike's final scene.As I said, all the actors are brillian but most memorable are Roger Rees (who seemed born to play the part), David Threlfall as Smike (an astonishing performance), John Woodvine as the evil Ralph Nickleby (cool underplaying with bursts of temper), Alun Armstrong as Squeers, the villain from hell, Edward Petherbridge as Newman Noggs, Suzanne Bertish in several roles, a pre-Edge Of Darkness Bob Peck as two wildly different characters, and Emily Richard in the thankless role of goody-goody Kate Nickleby.One word to anyone who has never seen this production. Act One is decidedly grim and occasionally brutal. When this was first shown on television, I knew several people who never got beyond that part. But don't give up. Once Nicholas rebels against Squeers and leaves the school, everything lightens up considerably. And no one should miss the marvellous finale to Act Two when Nicholas and Smike and a travelling theatre company perform the final scene from Romeo And Juliet, complete with exaggerated Victorian acting and a happy ending (""I wasn't dead - I was stunned"")!I'm absolutely delighted that Nicholas NIckleby has become available on DVD. I recommend it to anyone who loves theatre, great acting or just a rollicking good old-fashioned story.",N/A

The story is something fairly original, and unexpected. The acting is top notch, with performances by Cruise and Farrell that are pretty much the best they will ever do. The special effects are believable and fun to watch. This is an all around great sci-fi movie. I classify it as a mix between Blade Runner and Dirty Harry.",N/A

148422,"The first film to sweep all the major Oscars since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975; Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs is more than just the most unnerving mainstream serial killer film of all time (the only other movie that comes close to rivaling it is Seven), it is a masterpiece of modern day cinema.  The story, as we all know by now, revolves around haunted FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) trying to get information out of imprisoned cannibalistic killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) on a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).  The amazing interplay between Foster and Hopkins is the film's main highlight, but the laced with suspense prison break will have you jolting out of your seat.  Those who have never seen this film should definitely pick up this generously priced extra laced DVD, but the long out of print Criterion Collection DVD is more than worth tracking down as well.",The Silence of the Lambs VHS
380737,"I've always felt that this was an underrated film. In my opinion it ranks as one of the best of the mountain man/Native American genre. It is also as good a film as Charlton Heston was ever a part of.What's so good about it? Well, first of all it has no glaring historical inaccuracies- those always drive me nuts. The costumes and props are as accurate as I've seen. The scenery is absolutely magnificent and you feel like you are there- it always reminds me of my own times in the Central Rockies. As for the acting, well, you actually start caring about the characters, and thats a pretty good sign of good acting in my book. The dialog is also among the most consistently humorous and clever that I've heard- there's nothing phoney or forced about it. Heston and Keith play off of each other perfectly. Not least of all, the Indian peoples are treated with the dignity and complexity that they deserve- no stereotypes here.I don't buy every DVD that comes along, but I had to have this one for my personal collection. It just makes me feel good to watch it when the modern world starts to get me down....",Mountain Men VHS

762836,"Jamie Kennedy is the bomb! Malibu's Most Wanted could have used some work but Kennedy plays the lead character with style and keeps you laughing when the film gets its worse.  I've always liked Jamie since Scream because of his unique comedic style. He never ceases to amaze. In Malibu's Most Wanted Jamie gives the audience a lot to think about AND laugh at.B-Rad ( Kennedy ) becomes the subject of a brutal joke. His father ( Ryan O'Neal ) inlists his campaign manager ( Blair Underwood ) to help him deal with his son. The problem is O'Neal's running for office and B-Rad's hip-hop antics are costing him votes. Thus, the kidnap plot of the year begins. And may I say it was a very funny and unique plot. We present Anthony Anderson and Taye Diggs ( two of the most popular black actors today ) playing actors. They know as much about the 'hood as B-Rad does so when they are hired to play gangstas and kidnap B-Rad the comedy really starts. They bring in a sistah, Shondra ( Regina Hall )to tempt B-Rad and she does just that. He ends up falling head over heels in love with her. Shondra finds herself attracted to him as well and why not? Jamie's hot whether he's white or black. I thought the transformation Anderson and Diggs did from actors to criminals was one of the funniest in the film but stands behind B-Rad hands down. Jamie rocked the house and though the film was cliched and stereotypical, you get a lot of laughs. I was hoping the film would stay original but it ended up being another Bringing Down The House, except Malibu's Most Wanted had more intelligence when it came to its audience. It didn't try to insult by having a bunch of black people do stupid things. What it did was educate in its own way showing that hip hop can truly be a culture of many flavors and can be used to bring people together. It may seem sappy but in the end you get a nice, multicultural comedy filled with interracial romance, rap stars, talking rats, bumping and grinding and all around fun.  In the end B-Rad learns more about himself than he thought he would and so do we.I think this film is worth a look and believe me, I love intelligent films. This film may not be the calibur of Hamlet but it wasn't supposed to be. I think people forget that this was a COMEDY, a film to watch to have a good time. You don't always have to have a film that's socially and politically correct. I'm a black woman and nothing in this film offended me. I appreciated the effort and loved the fresh spin on how blacks and whites relate to hip hop. This may not be your cup of tea and that's fine. But as Jamie Kennedy says in the film &quot; Don't be hatin' &quot; which is a fine line if you think about it. Especially if you haven't given the movie a true chance.  I'd just watch it all over again for Jamie if nothing else. He is so fine.  Give the film a chance and draw your own conclusions.",Malibu's Most Wanted
768725,"The introductory DVD release of vintage Warner Bros. animated shorts is now available in two forms: the highly recommended 4-Disc GOLDEN COLLECTION, and the present alternate 2-Disc PREMIERE COLLECTION, a spare and stingy serving of twenty-eight cartoons with no frills.The majority of the classic cartoons included on the PREMIERE COLLECTION are artistically valuable. The cartoons are uncut, unedited, uncompressed and beautifully restored to their full original Technicolor glory. All the films included, even the weakest, deserve preservation, restoration and DVD availability.But although the basic material is excellent, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend the PREMIERE COLLECTION. This is why I have rated it only four stars out of five. (My rating for the GOLDEN COLLECTION is a solid five stars.) The PREMIERE COLLECTION includes only the cartoons from Discs Three and Four of the GOLDEN COLLECTION, without the many extras.The selection spans two decades (1940-59) and includes the initial films of the Road Runner (""Fast and Furry-ous""), Marvin the Martian, the Tasmanian Devil and the Academy Award-winning debut of ""Speedy Gonzales"". Key films of such popular characters as Sylvester & Tweety, Pep&eacute; Le Pew, and Foghorn Leghorn are duly included, along with a few one-shots and curios.Buyers expecting a cavalcade of favorites need to be aware that the PREMIERE COLLECTION features a mere handful of appearances of the true stars of the Looney Tunes galaxy. You will look here in vain for an adequate selection of classic Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig cartoons. Such masterpieces as ""Duck Dodgers in the 24-1/2 Century"", ""Duck Amuck"" and ""Wabbit Twouble"" are to be found only on the GOLDEN COLLECTION.The 4-Disc GOLDEN COLLECTION, with its fifty-six cartoons and hours of supplemental extras, which are both entertaining and educational (hint to parents), is worth more than its cost in dollars and is a better investment for families, animation buffs and anyone concerned with popular art and culture.High sales of the superior GOLDEN COLLECTION will determine future releases, so fans and students of classic animation are strongly urged to buy that instead. Parents desiring that the heritage of Bugs Bunny and friends continue to be made available to their children and grandchildren might also keep this in mind when choosing between the lesser and the greater.CARTOONS ARE FOR EVERYONE!Rating: 8/10 **** OUTSTANDING.",N/A
739154,"This is a wonderful little movie (although any movie directed by Bruce Beresford and starring Pierce Brosnan isn't that little). Other reviews have done a good job of encapsulating the plot, so I'll say that what impressed me most was the film's ability to capture a time and a mood. The script is excellent and the acting is good, but what continues to stun me is that this is a true story that happened less than fifty years ago in a supposedly civilized country. One reviewer wrote that the movie's outcome was inevitable--heroic father fights to take back his kids and wins in the face of overwhelming odds. The problem with that characterization is that this is a true story, and it was not inevitable. As the movie is at pains to state, the outcome was quite without precedent under Irish law. Only someone with a heart of iron could fail to be moved by this film. Throw away the Bond movies and buy this one.",Evelyn
792284,"This isn't a terrific movie by any stretch. There are more than a few laughable scenes and silly, ridiculous occurrences. We laughed out loud when Kevin Zeger's character, Dale, was smoking. Like Clinton (*cough*) he didn't inhale, although he took several drags on the cigarette. My question for that scene is: why bother having the kid smoke if he's not going to inhale? Obviously Zeger doesn't smoke, and for that I applaud him, as so many actors and actresses in Hollywood do.Regarding the silly occurrences. Say you're a father with a child that has a terrible fear of the dark. Would you:a) Put a number of floodlights where they could be easily reached, say a chest in an open area, orb) Put them in a dark attic?Of course the movie chose ""b"".Regardless, I was immensely surprised when I found myself trapped in suspense. There were moments of dramatic tension that actually made me a little nervous (perhaps even a little scared, although I never jumped), and when the movie was over, and I walked into my office (being 1:00am, my entire condo was dark, and my office darker than any other area) I really did take a tiny ""gulp"" until the light turned on. The same for returning to bed - until the light on my nightstand was turned on, I was somewhat on edgeGiven the movie's obvious flaws, this made me more than a little embarrassed. But like I said, they handled some of the scary scenes quite well, even though I rolled my eyes during the stolen scene from the Frighteners. That was unnecessary. I can't imagine why they chose to write that scene into the script.

762144,"I've always wanted to see POSSESSION in its Director's Cut, although I've never seen it before but saw the video box in the horror section. A favorite of Dario Argento's, POSSESSION is the greatest horror allegory on divorce since David Cronenberg's THE BROOD. Sam Neill and Isabele Adjani are excellent in portraying the emotional distress of growing apart. It's also a comment on the state of Germany when the Berlin Wall was still erect and the Cold War was in full effect. As an added bonus, it's also a bizarre monster movie, kind of a psychosexual Frankenstein story. Great camerawork, music and ending! Highly recommended for open minds and strong stomachs!I remember watching SHOCK when I was a kid on television (as BEYOND THE DOOR 2). The last half-hour of the movie has stuck out in my mind ever since. Mario Bava's final film (aided by his son Lamberto, a great director in his own right) is about possession, repressed memory, and psychological torment, with an excellent performance by Argento veteran Daria Nicolodi as the woman who experiences all of the above.

Quality cheese entertains on many different levels: it's fun, it's funny, it's darned likable, it inspires your imagination and speaks to the kid in you. V the series does all those things. It's funny even when it's not supposed to be. It's as fun as your favorite kid show or old comic book. The characters are soo likable and that includes those who want to eat humans for lunch! It really speaks to the kid in me and inspires my imagination. It's had that effect on others too from all the fan fiction  I recently found on the net.

817723,"Adam Sandler is known for his laugh out loud gross humor, like in his recent films ""Mr. Deeds"" and ""Anger Manangement."" He always seems to play the same type of characters like in those movies as well. They are usually shot by the critics. Even in ""Punch Drunk Love"" he plays the character, but that was hailed by critics. But then there is ""50 First Dates"" where he and actress Drew Barrymoore reunite, except it is not your usual Adam Sandler. Normally he is a good natured man, who has a hidden violent temper. But in this movie he shows the sweet side of him. It was a nice change, even though all of his past movies are still great. Sander and Barrymoore first acted together in ""The Wedding Singer"" and worked well off of each other in that, and in this. Two very talented celebrities working well equals a great movie.Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, the kind of guy who likes who go out with a women one day, and then leave them the next day. He works with animals, and likes to hang out with his friend Ula. He doesn't want to settle down with a women, because he has a job to travel to the artic and study the walrus. But in a diner run by Sue and the cook Nick, he meets Lucy Whitmore a beautiful blonde women who spends a mourning with Henry, causing him to fall in love. The plan to have breakfast the next mourning, but when he shows up, she has no idea who he is. Sue tells Henry that she was in a car accident about a year ago, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She remember everythings that happened before the car crash. So everyday she thinks that it is the day of her accident, causing her to do the same thing every single day. With her docotr, Dr. Keats, knowing that there is nothing to cure Lucy, everyday is the same, only she doesn't know that. Her father Martin, and her brother Doug, also go to the extremes to make everything the same each day, except when they find out about Henry's intentions, they become nervous that he will ruin everything that they do everyday. But everyday, Henry falls deeper and deeper into love with Lucy, except that she has no idea who he is 24 hours later. From that point on, he goes to the extremes to try and remind her who he is every single day.""50 First Dates"" has a very funny idea, and the entire film works. There is not even any gross humor, except for the beginning when a walrus vomits on another person. Alot of the comedy comes from Ula, played by comedian Rob Schneider, who has five children, all of them smarter then he is. I liked everything about this movie, except I liked ""Anger Manangement"" better. This was a comedy, with small dabs of drama added in, except it's needed. It sounds like something that the Farrelly Brother's would do, but its not. It's is a classic Adam Sandler film.ENJOY!Rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor and drug references.",N/A

758068,"After seeing this film I felt sick and nauseated, and because of this it is very hard for me to recommend this movie to anyone.  This movie features the most horrific murder scene in film history... period.  It also features an excruciatingly long and brutal rape scene (over 10 minutes) that is equally hard to watch.  Both are done with such graphic realism it is impossible to detect they are just an illusion.  The murder scene, in particular, is so realistic it still haunts me today.So why am I giving this ""trash"" 4 stars?  Well, surprisingly this movie is far from it.  The acting and direction are both superb.  Irreversible also follows a Kubrick-like approach to filmmaking.  Both directors use the camera as a tool that allows the audience to simply observe what is going on at the particular moment.  You truly get the feeling you are a bystander watching what unfolds.  There is also a very meaningful scene towards the end where you see a poster of 2001 (Gaspar No&eacute; must be a fan of Kubrick).The structure is similar to Memento where it starts at the end and works its way back- one piece at a time.  In the beginning (or ending), the movie starts with a very dizzy camera approach showing a state of chaos that gradually settles down as the movie progresses to the end (or beginning).  If you are brave enough to attempt to watch this movie please don't let the camera work throw you!!!  It may seem annoying at first, but it is absolutely intentional.  You will get used to it and it does get better (I promise), and even during the dizzy moments it strategically slows down to a halt during key scenes before reverting again.  The camera work itself showcases the movie's tagline ""time destroys everything"" in how a state of being can radically change from wonderful peace and harmony to a tragic state of complete destruction.  This is a very shocking and disturbing film, and the experience will definitely stay with you... probably for the rest of your life.",N/A
12045,"1776 is a great movie. It has drama, comedy and great music.I am a history buff who is not a big fan of musicals but the songs in this movie add so much to it.  For instance Molasses to Rum to Slaves leaves a chilling and damning impression of those in New England who both condemned and benefited from the slave trade.Other songs like The EGG which is about which national symbol to choose (the eagle, the turkey or the dove) is just plain fun to listen to and will make you smile.The debate about whether to chose independence is very well done.  The dialogue is both sharp as well as funny.  The debates between John Adams and John Dickinson are memorable and offer and understanding of the arguments for and against independence.For fans who have the VHS version I recommend getting the DVD.  The approximately 20 minutes or so (it seems longer) of added movie is noticeable and adds much to the overall production.

797579,"I had heard some truly wonderful things about this movie and was looking forward to watching it. Mona Lisa Smile tells the story of a professor (Julia Roberts) who starts teaching Art History, or Appreciation, or something at Wellesley (an all-girls school). There are several big name young actresses-I mean students in her class. And they're all know-it-alls.The movie wants to be the ""girls' version of Dead Poet's Society"" so bad that the creators of DPS should be looking into a slander lawsuit because it is insulting what they do to what was originally a really good movie. Katherine Watson (Roberts) came to Wellesley to make a difference and she was not going to take no for an answer. So, when the actresses-I mean students outsmart her, she has to make the class more difficult. Because I guess they're not *really* learning until Watson has taught them. And Watson is not going to just teach them about Art. No. She's gonna teach them about *life* and that they don't have to get married and have babies. They can be whatever they want because they are soooo smart. And if they want to get married and have babies, then they're just in denial. Because Watson knows everything! Sadly, no one dies unlike in the original DPS.There's the antagonist, Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst), who hates Watson, but in the end, loves her the most. The protagonist, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles), who respects Watson, but in the end teaches Watson a life lesson. The morally ambivalent wanna-be, Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who wants to be Watson. And the ""ugly, fat girl"", Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin), who just wants to be liked by a boy.Most of the acting was very cardboard. I am not sure whether to blame this on the script, the director, or the actors. Julia Roberts looked exactly the same as she has looked in her past 5 movies. Same ""smile"" theme, same bursting laugh, same ""unliked-girl"" who really is a pretty woman (ha!) deep down. She's turning into Meg Ryan by picking the same character over and over again.Kirsten Dunst's character was a little too whiney and in the end, when Betty Warren does the ""morphosis"", it is not believable. Even if it was believable, then we wouldn't really care because the way she was portrayed would be akin to feeling sympathy for Atilla the Hun.Julia Stiles was the only one whose character seemed to remain consistant. I am not sure if this is because of her acting or because the script didn't call for a ""character evolution"". Either way, Joan was still boring and lifeless.Maggie Gyllenhaal is beautiful and sexy and boy is Giselle a sexually free spirit in this movie. Hmm...Secretary, anyone? But, I'm not sure what they were trying to do with that student-teacher relationship/affair thing. Maybe I fell asleep and missed it.For the life of me I could not figure out why they thought Ginnifer Goodwin's character was fat or ugly so, we'll just ignore her because her character has no conflict!For that matter, nothing at all anywhere in this entire movie does...Oh, did I fail to point out that the title is mentioned throughout the movie at least eleventy-billion times?

276589,"Are we sure of what we see?  Or is what we see actually what we THINK we see?  Can we distort our perceptions in blowing up a photograph to expose a not-so-defined area and see something we think is something else?  The moral seems to be that like the game of tennis played with an imaginary ball by the rag week students in clown/mime makeup, is that we believe what we see, and we see what our perceptions tell us.Michelangelo Antonioni's first English-language film follows Thomas (David Hemmings), a jaded and bored fashion photographer who depending on his mood, is brusque with his models, though he is civil with his Girl Friday, with whom he communicates on a two-way.Things get exciting after he shoots a couple in the park and the woman demands the photos he snapped.  The scene where the woman enters his studio trying to get the photos he snapped of her is an interesting look at Antonioni's technique.  No, it's not the scene of her shedding her blouse, but the way Antonioni photographs the woman among the clutter in Thomas's apartment, signifying a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere played out in their cat-and-mouse game.  Clearly, the 60's was a time where established stars baring themselves was taboo.  Hence Vanessa Redgrave's placement of her arms over her breasts and her bare back shown in rear shots establishing that she is indeed topless.The moments of near silence become more effective as the viewer is drawn into Thomas's developing the photos.  As he develops two photos in particular, he notices something in the way and direction the woman is looking as she embraces her lover.  The trips to the darkroom to blow up certain portions draws the viewer in, which mirrors Thomas's excitement.  For him, an artist, this is the moment, the present, the work in process.  The montage of photos, originals and blowups, is a highlight in this scene, as the photos tell a story.  And the things with blowups is a reminder of what Kennedy conspiracy theorists did with blowups of the Zapruder film frames, where they claimed a gunman's head and rifle could be seen in as in Zapruder Frame 413.One interesting comment that arises is Thomas's visit to an artist friend's place.  The artist Bill remarks on a piece of Pollock-like abstract art that it's like a detective story.  Later, when Thomas shows one of his blown up photos of whom he thinks is a murdered man, Patricia, a woman whom he yearns for, says that it looks like one of Bill's paintings, completing the symmetry full circle.  So art, like truth, is totally dependent on our interpretation.This film also benefits from Herbie Hancock's hip score, clearly very 60's, and the appearance of the Yardbirds, where they perform ""Stroll In.""  There are a few closeup shots of Jimmy Page and where Jeff Beck smashes his guitar at the end of the performance.  The fashions of the time, such as the colourful Mary Quant minis and hairdos worn by Gillian Hills (the blonde) and Jane Birkin (the brunette), the latter who gained notice after the playful romp with Thomas.  Hemmings's character also sets the stage for his playing handsome but arrogant male leads such as in Barbarella and Profondo Rosso, where he's an artist of another kind.  Peter Bowles, who plays Thomas's friend Ron, would later find fame in the BBC series To the Manor Born, Rumpole of the Bailey, and The Irish RM.A different kind of film, a hallmark of the stylish and swinging 60's of England, Blow Up has the Antonioni's trademark introversion, sparse dialogue, scenes of total silence, followed by bursts of louder scenes.  A classic period piece.",N/A

They act like this is the ONLY movie in their vaults and treat it like George Lucas editing on a bad day. I have now 3 Anchor Bay versions of this film and really don't need anymore. They spend all their time on this film,releasing it,pulling it,releasing it,pulling it. If it wasn't put out so half-assed in the first couple of runs then they wouldn't have to do any more releases. In my opinion YES the box set is enough to be the DEFINITIVE collection. If you don't own any version of this film then YES please pick this up. If your like me then WHY do you need to plunck down more loot for a film I have in one form or the other.Anchor Bay has continually drop the ball and from what I heard had one of the Fn execs on the commentary???why??what did you have to do with this film whatsoever???Anchor Bay has a great catalog but they act like some stupid rich kid who doesnt want to share.

I ended up giving it three stars because it hits the mark in some important areas, but misses the chance to be an excellent five star sex flick with others.  Is there naked women being abused in this film?  Yes.  Are the abuse scenes ""erotic enough"" to excite the common ""freaky"" viewers out there?  Somewhat.For example, in one sequence where a young, hot looking naked prisoner girl was caged and subsequently ""whipped"" by the transsexual wardon...the whipping of her breasts was done so gently and ridiculously fake...it was a phony turn off!However, in another sexual scene where a young prisoner girl was sold into sexual slavery to a rough looking guy on a fishing boat...his subsequent rape of that girl was a ""very hot"" sex scene and worth all three stars, in my rating of this film!  So you see folks...if you are looking for constant stimulation while watching this old sex classic...you have to look elsewhere, such as the film ""The Image"".I know there are couples out there just dying to get their hands on these old Euro sex flicks to watch after a nice dinner to lead them into a sexual fantasy mode...this movie may be good enough to do that for you...The hot sex scene on the boat with the kidnapped teen is worth a boner or two!",Sadomania
757311,"I recently picked this up cheap at the local Wal Mart.  It was one of those cop-type films of 2003 that I have been wanting to get.  So I was gleeful at the price...bargain bin deal if you know what I mean.But anyway, this movie reminded me of cross between 1993's &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and ironically 1981's &quot;First Blood&quot; (Rambo I).  The Fugitive because of the cat and mouse game played between Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Torro, and First Blood because of the setting and &quot;hunting tactics&quot;.The movie starts out with del Torro in the middle of a battle zone during the Kosovo conflict in 1999.  This was the most intense and realistic battle scene of this conflict I have ever seen on film.  Great special effects and tension.  You've got del Torro sneaking around, playing dead half the time, evading Serb soldiers to get to his final target, a Serbian commander who's ordering the shootings of every ethnic Albanian.  This scene is what finally made del Torro flip.So del Torro is back in the states 5 years later and starts going on a killing spree, killing a group of hunters in the north west around Portland, OR.  It is then that we're introduced to Jone's character who was del Torro's killing instructor in the military.  So from here on out through the rest of the movie, we see a cat and mouse game between the two ranging from environs from the forest to a waterfall/river/damn, to the city streets and industrial complex.  It ends with an extremely bloody knife fight where both fighters end up near dead.But anyway, the thing that really pulled me into the film was the great soundtrack.  Very powerful and emersive 5.1 surround track.  Especially the Kosovo battle.",N/A
1221017,"_American Gun_ seems to set people off in two distinct directions: either you love it's subtle anti-firearms message or you run screaming for the hills and feel like the movie falls apart in the last fifteen minutes.  Regardless of my own political/moral views concerning guns, I was pulled into this film by two aspects.  First, the story was a fresh one and did not (for most of the film) descend into a well-traveled plot.  The idea of tracing a gun's history, letting the owner's lives and experiences tell the story of self-defense and homicide, is an original one that made the movie fresh and exciting.  This device, the gun, also provided a source for constant change in the movie and kept the movie afloat on its current.  The second thing that pulled me in is the powerful final performance of James Coburn, an actor who always succeeds at playing his parts with style, grace, and a deft control of the character.  Coburn manages to communicate the pain of a man who loses his daughter to an act of gun violence.  His ability to remain strong, shutting out those around him while privately grieving for his daughter, honestly connects up to my experiences of strong men of the old guard.  James Coburn was a wonderful actor and _American Gun_ is a fine film to cap one's career.As to the final section of the film, I do not agree with those who believe the film falls apart or becomes unravelled.  I enjoyed the sudden twist of the final few moments (though I can't say it was completely unexpected) and thought that it gave the film a final powerful blow.  Rather than depict the lives of saints who are completely sympathetic and understandable, director Alan Jacobs decided to portray real characters-complete with moral ambiguity and problems.  If you enjoy smaller films and will not be completely chaffed by a subtle movie that explores the issues concerning the Second Amendment, you should check out _American Gun_ .  While it may not be the best thing you've seen in years, it is a fresh film, with a fresh outlook, that guarantees to entertain.",American Gun

149744,"There is a genre of film simply known as a ""New York Movie."" It's a film where the city itself plays a role in the story. This can be as varied as the Musical, ""On The Town,"" the comedy ""Arthur,"" The fantasy ""Superman: The Movie"" or the drama ""Taxi Driver."" ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" is a true ""New York Movie.""The plot begins when a small group of terrorists hijacks a subway train and holds the passengers for ransom. At first, the concept seems far-fetched (""Where're they gonna go?"") but a convincing script from Peter Stone (from John Godey's novel) makes the plot move forward.It's really the performances that keep the story on track: Walter Matthau as a harried trainmaster, barking out orders and watching the situation develop from his command post, Robert Shaw as the ringleader of the band of crooks aboard the hijacked train (with Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo as his partners in crime), and an impressive and authentically New York supporting cast (including Jerry Stiller, James Broderick, Doris Roberts and Lee Wallace, who plays the mayor, and who looks quite a bit like Ed Koch, even though Koch hadn't yet been elected at the time of the film's release)!It all works to give you a true sense of the flavor of the city in the mid 1970s. Filmed on location in the actual tunnels and trains, it's a clever story and is brilliant. If you like suspense thrillers that are a little smarter than the typical, this film is for you.Highly Recommended!",N/A
798165,"I love Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton..Without too much explanations, they are simply two of the best actors/actresses of all time.But watching Something's Gotta Give, I can not but feel sheer disappointment at the result that could have been far better with a tighter script and better director.First of all the problem with the film is its length, over two hours long..I never minded long films, (I sat through Bertoluccis's Novencetto more times that I can remember without being aware or bothering too much with its length)..But to sit through two hours of an overstretched story that is drenched in sugary sentimentality was tiring.Moreover, the problem with the film is too many unnecessary characters. For instance the characters of Frances McDormand and Paul Michael Glazer, although credited as stars, were too shallow, appearing in a couple of scenes at most and added nothing to the plot.Amanda's Peet character was also very badly written: we see here at first falling for the rich older guy without sleeping with him, inexplicably telling him when they arrived at her mother's house: are you glad we waited?? !!! Then towards the end of the film and in a space of six months,( movie time), we see her the image of domesticity, married and  three months pregnant!!Keanu Reeves also inexplicably falls head over heels with Keaton's character, and their short romance is probably the lamest and most confusing I have seen in a film.Now I have to mention few words about the acting of Nicholson and Keaton:Nancy Meyers manages to get so much over the top acting from them, and fails miserably to get the right performances.The scenes I cringed in the most are the ones we see them crying, probably intended to add some bittersweet humor, but it became overbearingly annoying.When Nicholson cried at the very end of About Schmidt, I connected totally with him, and it was genuinely bittersweet because his tears reflected his whole story, his loneliness, frustration and tinge of hope for the future, in short they had deep meaning. In Something's Gotta Give, even for a comedy, it was totally pointless.Yet I must say that there were few laughs in the first half of the movie, and some promise of a sweet romantic movie, unfortunately lost in the second half, ruining the whole film.Having said all that, the only aspect of the film which I liked, was how refreshing to see people above sixty, falling in love and having sex..not many films have shown that.I now must mention, maybe two trivial observations,that did not help this negative review.The first is the issue of smoking..We see Keaton as an anti smoking healthy woman, but at the end she lights up!! Probably intended to reflect how she has lightened up..but it was a very wrong message to give (and this is coming from a smoker!!) it is time filmmakers take some responsibility in this very sensitive issue.The other observation revolves around a scene when just before making love, Nicholson asks Keaton about birth control pills, and she naturally answers,no menopause!! Although it is kind of a funny dialog, she should have asked him instead whether he had a condom or not!! him being as it has been over emphasized,a sexually promiscuous man..again this would have been a good message to send at a time when sexual transmitted diseases and especially AIDS are still very much with us, and more so with straight people..So Something's Gotta Give is a missed opportunity to take advantage of the wealth of talent involved, and a proof that excellent actors are not enough to make a good movie.",N/A
338505,"Michael Caine and Pierce Brosnan in a cold war spy thriller...you know with those credentials you're in for some topnotch cinema and The Fourth Protocol does not disappoint.The &quot;thriller&quot; face of the movie is cleverly crafted, it absorbs the viewer with long stretches of drama. The theme veers around the politics of the cold war and the power struggles of governments, both within and without.As such, the film is thus more about the political conscience and the mindgames of those involved in international sabotage than it is about exploding bombs or rattling guns, a point which some reviewers obviously missed when they lament the lack of &quot;action&quot;.The beauty of the film is in its character development. Brosnan's rendition of a dark, brooding Russian with an outwardly cheerful disposition and a perfect British accent, is marvellous. One can see why he is where he is today as an actor. Michael Caine, needless to say, is sharp yet amusing as an independent-minded but loyal British secret services officer.A fascinating rental if you aren't expecting a Lethal Weapon.

143256,"This is one of those movies that gore fanatics and Fangoria readers rave about. For them, this movie delivers. For others this is just a rehash of the original with plenty of gore injected to make up for what is lacking in the script. I did get the impression that Hooper may have tired of being nagged to do a sequel to his classic and instead did an over-the-top send-up to put an end to it. Unfortunately this just gave fuel to the idea of a sequel for others to do one. In this sequel the family, now named the Sawyers, has relocated to another texas community. Sally and Franklin's uncle, a Texas Ranger, played by Dennis Hopper, is on the trail of the family. He enlists the aid of a lady DJ nicknamed Stretch (yes, have as much fun with that one as you would like) to draw out the family through her radio broadcasts. Leatherface, now called Bubba (why), takes a liking to Stretch and really wants to show her his chainsaw (I am not kidding, the chainsaw becomes an overly obvious phallic image in this movie). Leatherface also likes to dance when he attacks with his chainsaw by using a move he learned by watching a few too many ZZ Top videos. Beyond this point the movie consists of a lot of gore and redone scenes from the first movie (hit her grandpa, hit her; and even the chainsaw dance at the end). The technical inaccuracies with regard to special effects and continuity with the first film are abundant (anybody familiar with the first film will laugh at the sight of Franklin's flashlight, and let's not even talk about pickups doing 100mph in reverse). If Hoopers intention was parody, he partly succeeded, but with such extreme gore in contrast to the original. The first movie succeeded so well by leaving the gore to the imagination of the viewer; this movie puts all the gore on-screen and suffers for it.-Bob",N/A
623467,"Like the reviewer who said he couldn't stop laughing while viewing this ridiculous piece of low grade cinema, I, too, found myself laughing and saying out loud to no one in particular, ""This is just plain stupid.  The effects are not even that great and not even halfway believable.""The only thing that attracted me to this movie was the trailer, which, as it turns out, was the best part of the movie.Lines like, ""There are more things to do with books than burning them"" are just annoying and uncalled for and would make any lover of literature cringe, even under the circumstances that the books were being burned.  (To make a fire in a library fireplace to keep warm-whatever.)  When a guy is sifting through books to toast, he expresses his disapproval over the possible burning of a Nitzsche title.  But lo and behold, around the corner pops a guy who exclaims, ""Hey, there's a whole section of tax books over here guys!"" and away they go to add the IRS to the bonfire.I can't remember the last time I saw Dennis Quaid in anything I was glad I paid money to see, but witnessing Jake Gyllanhall struggle through this two hour mess just made me sad.  An actor with his potential, (re: The Good Girl) should not even be looking at scripts this bad.It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.  It's the end of this movie, and I am glad.Do yourself a favor the next time you get a hankering to watch a disaster movie and rent something done by Irwin Allen in the seventies.

103405,"This is one of the best films I have seen this year. I thought there were many outstanding performances: the narrator (the New York writer who comes south to write an article on Savannah ), Jim Williams,the genteel antiques dealer; his lawyer,who finally achieves an acquittal for his long-term client; Billy,Jim's  young drug-taking homosexual employee who is also his lover, Joe Odom the piano player and his girlfriend Mandy, and particularly Minerva the voodoo priestess and Lady Chablis all really impressed me with their performances. The story is an interesting one set in a slow Southern Gothic pace, and there is in addition the wonderful Johnny Mercer song ""Skylark"" which is played at the beginning and at the end. I think the character of Savannah is brought out in the film in many ways: the walks in the park, the Mercer house, the identical scenes at beginning and end in which Minerva feeds a squirrel sitting on a park bench as the plane arrives overhead. Not to mention that voodoo is part of Savannah's ambience. Plus there are wonderful humorous interludes: the man walking the invisible dog, the man who carries flies on pieces of string and threatens to empty a bottle of toxic poison into the city's water supply; the ladies bridge society. The best individual performance is probably by Kevin Spacey followed closely by Minerva, Lady Chablis, Williams' lawyer, and the narrator and his girlfriend Mandy. In the end the narrator wins the girl, after Minerva tells him, ""Don't focus so much on the dead that you forget the living.""",N/A

733001,"Futurama is the best animated series to ever grace the television screen. It's better than The Simpsons, it's better than The Family Guy, it's flat out the best. Not only is the humor goofy, intelligent, scathingly satirical, and genius, but the voice acting is top notch, the animation and computer generated images are revolutionary, the orchestral music accompaniments are amazing, and the writing is one that even quantum physicists have to appreciate.If you don't believe me, listen to the commentary. Listen to the thought that the writers put into each episode, how they have former physicists on their staff. How they'll argue for days about whether or not it's realistic for Fry and his buddies to survive in each of the environments they are put in....But this series truly shines in the subtlety of the joke. Rather than bashing your head in with the humor, like the Family Guy, or leaving you chagrined with a touch of sentimental warmth like the Simpsons, Futurama shamelessly puts its protagonist idiot, Fry, and the rest of the crew in jokes where the punchline isn't even uttered sometimes. It's up to the audience to get the other half of the joke, and it's the biggest reason why Futurama didn't last on TV. Groening went in a different direction than the Simpsons, because he couldn't cop out with childish goofy humor, being that all his characters were adults, and intelligent ones at that (other than Fry). He left it up to the viewer to &quot;get it&quot;, and for those of us who do, the results are hilarious beyond belief.",Futurama: Volume One

541970,"'Memento' is a very well made film. The main character Leonard makes genuinely surprising discoveries throughout his search for the man who murdered his wife. This is a revenge movie in which I actually felt sympathy for the protagonist, for, though 'Memento' is primarily a thriller, it does not gloss over the sorrow Leonard feels about his wife. Unfortunately, Leonard is also very confused and vulnerable because the man who killed Leonard's wife also injured Lenny in the head, causing him to have very short short term memory. One of the main themes of 'Memento' is how crummy people are - and how people will manipulate each other at any chance they get.'Memento' is famous for being told ""backward"". One thread plays forward, another, which involves most of the action in the story, works backward, scene by scene. It works well, and is more than a gimmick. The climax is neither predictable nor over the top, and is one of the best I have seen in a while.The acting is astounding, particularly by Carrie Ann Moss. As her character gradually unfolds, the viewer sees the greatly varied facets of her personality. Joe Palantino is an excellent actor, and he is perfectly cast as an untrustworthy but seemingly helpful cop. Guy Pearce successfully plays Leonard Shelby, who is alternately lost, driven, disciplined, and frazzled. Each main character is sympathetic in some way but has a supremely unpleasant streak.Due to its intricate plot, carefully attended details, and complex character motives, 'Memento' holds up on repeated viewings.

378125,"Follow Your Bliss! ~Joseph Campbell (1904-1987)Joseph Campbell's mind is beyond fascinating. As you view Bill Moyers trying to understand the absolute intellectual bliss Joseph Campbell is engaged in, you can't help but wonder how anyone could maintain the wealth of knowledge swirling in ecstasy in their mind. Joseph Campbell fits each piece of information into a richly woven spiritual tapestry.Suddenly life becomes much more simple when the universe is explained in a myth. We all see the similarities of the Hero's Adventure in books and movies, but why is this such a prevalent theme and are we all taking this journey? Joseph Campbell believes we are on our own spiritual journeys in which our consciousness is transformed through trials. If life seems like a struggle to you, then the first section about the Hero's Adventure will explain why we must slay our dragons by overcoming fear and other primal inclinations.Myths can be clues to spirituality and in all cultures, stories of creation and death encourage an understanding of our beginning and end. But are we really ever in any state other than Eternity itself? Joseph Campbell explains why good and evil are temporal apparitions and explores living life as a poem.During the taping of these interviews, Joseph Campbell had just purchased a computer and has some interesting observations about his interactions.In this six-part, six-hour interview style journey, you will learn about the yin/yang symbol, why people sacrifice their ego in marriage, why love is the perfect kindness and how libido can be an impulse to life itself.Other topics of interest: Star Wars, The Holy Grail, Romantic Love, Nirvana, Inner Mythology, the Virgin Birth, Agricultural Societies and the Goddess, Biblical Complexities, Spiritual Rebirth, Rituals as enactments of myths, the Soul as a Circle, Archetypes, Insight into the Human Psyche, Deep Mystery, Chakras, Mysteries of Creation, Compassion, James Joyce and Epiphanies, Monsters and Dragons, Poetry, Heaven and explanations of Brahma.If you have any interest in World Religions, this will take you to new levels in your understanding of universal desires, our search for a relationship with God and this may even help you understand your relationship with your life partner. Essential viewing for anyone interested in Myths, Buddhism or Christianity.When you think that this was recorded two years before Joseph Campbell's death, you cannot help but be amazed at the fluidity of his mind and the way in which he weaves concepts into eternal verbal bliss. He not only explains spiritual concepts, he takes you through amazing myths from Japanese, Native American, Egyptian and Mayan cultures. While he speaks, they present beautiful artwork illustrating the stories. He explains the difference between Amore, Eros and Agape and then explains how we can reach Nirvana by reaching a psychological place where we are unattached to desire and fear.At times Moyers seems to play with words as well as Joseph Campbell, but then at other times he seems to be asking for more information so the viewer can enjoy the depth of knowledge only an extremely perceptive interviewer could extract. At times he reads myths from one culture and Joseph reads them from another culture. The similarities are astonishing.The Hero's AdventureThe Message of the MythThe First StorytellersSacrifice and BlissLove and the GoddessMasks of EternityBonus Features: An Art Gallery and Selections from the video Sukhavati. Joseph Campbell narrates beautiful nature scenes. I found my six hour experience to be intellectually exhilarating. Half the fun of life is finding all the puzzle pieces needed to explain your very existence. This DVD set takes you beyond a basic understanding of mythology, it literally presents a pathway you could follow to spiritual bliss. I watched both DVDs in one day and was completely captivated by this intellectual tapestry.~The Rebecca Review",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS
612189,"Possibly the last really engaging broadcast TV series.  Missing since the late '90s, it seems we're about to get re-introduced to Quantum Leap.This Vonnegut-esque series is about a research physicist go gets ""unstuck"" in time, and randomly ""leaps"" into the lives of other people.  (Well, it may not be ""random"", but that's open to interpretation).  In any case, he remains in his new body until he rights a wrong in that person's life.What happens to the person Dr. Beckett replaces isn't always clear.  Later in the series we find that they go to a ""waiting room"" from Dr. Beckett's time, but even then the rules can get a little flexible.No matter  - the tableaux of events spanning the life of a later 20th century/ early 21st century physicist and rennaissance man lead to a number of compelling episodes. At various times, Dr. Beckett leaps into the life of a deaf man, an African-American, a condemned murderer, a person with Down's syndrome, and in one surprise episode, Lee Harvey Oswald.  Late in the series we learn there is an ""evil"" leaper, sent to make life miserable for those she ""leaps"" into.Joining Scott Bakula as Dr. Beckett is Dean Stockwell, a wonderfully underrated performer in a role that proves much deeper than most anticipated.I'm looking forward to this DVD, and hope for lots of extra features to bring this series to life.",Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season

786682,"If you read the hype leading up to this movie, you realized it would be a film highly influenced by Evil Dead and other 70's/80's horror.  Some of the reviewers here seem disappointed that there are a fair amount of laughs in this movie.  Cabin Fever is not as funny, scary, or original as The Evil Dead, but considering the trash Hollywood has been calling horror lately, I'm happy to watch Cabin Fever.One of the turn offs of this movie is how sleazy Eli Roth is on the commentary/outtakes.  He may be a different person in real life, but I got the impression he spent all his time kissing up to the female stars to try and get some nookie after shooting was done.  Hopefully I'm wrong, because I think he has a lot of potential.Bottom line, this movie has laughs, gore, and a story line that keeps your attention.  There's ample nudity, and an overkill of profanity.  But if you're tired of boring sequels like Halloween Resurrection, this is well worth your time.",Cabin Fever
629759,"The word liberal wasn't always an epithet.But it is now, thanks to a very successful effort on the part of the right to redefine what the word means.  Michael Moore is a liberal and isn't ashamed of it.  In fact he's proud of it, revels in it, trying to take back the word stolen from the left during the Reagan Era.Michael Moore is a brave man, taking on a sitting president during a time where the very rights and freedoms guaranteed us by the constitution are being questioned.  This period will be looked back upon as a very dark time in US history.  We now have brownshirts like Ann Coulter bandying about words like ""traitor"" and ""sedition"" when anyone questions the current government - a government that stole the 2000 election, and as a result, a government whose very legitimacy is questionable.The aggressively populist position of Michael Moore is succeeding where a quarter century of ""kid glove"" leftist rhetoric has failed.  He's taking on the bellicose right with a solid dose of their own medicine and IT'S WORKING.  The amazing thing to watch are the ensuing attacks on Mr. Moore not by the right, but by the leftist elite criticizing Mr. Moore for his tactics.  It's the business-as-usual-Democratic Party policy of eating itself from within.  The left has a tendency to try to be all things to all people, thus ending up being nothing to anyone.  This is best exemplified by the party's decision to choose John Kerry to be their presidential candidate, while a man of principles and ideas like Howard Dean is cast aside.  It's time for the left to stop relying on voters being willing to vote against ""the other side"" and give them ideas and positions worth voting FOR.Michael Moore understands this.  People have criticized this film for having a point of view.  It's a documentary and all documentaries come from a point of view, stating their case.  The real complaint is that this fat, grizzled, ball cap wearing guy with a camera is actually making a point and making more of a difference than all the usual suspects combined.  Michael Moore is through letting the right define what it is and what it means to be a liberal, to be a patriot.This movie is about the Presidency of George W. Bush and the terrible things that this inept, inarticulate puppet of the oil industry has done to maintain that ever-so-important flow of cheap oil.  It's about lives lost, lives ruined and a country losing the hard earned respect of the world.  Michael Moore gets his point across very effectively, forcing the viewer to ask the difficult questions they may not want to ask of themselves.Is it fair?  Of course not, but like anyone with a strong opinion, they're not going to BE fair when it comes to their beliefs.  It's up to you to make up your own mind whether Mr. Moore's opinions have merit.  You may not agree with him, but you SHOULD be asking yourself these questions.  This documentary provoked a strong response from everyone that I know that has seen it and in that respect, is an unqualified success.I think everyone of every political stripe should see this film.C'mon, what are you afraid of?",Fahrenheit 9/11
125652,"A remarkable film in which I can watch several times without faltering. I am as much a lover of history as I am of film and literature, so I must acknowledge that this film is loosely based on the life of Wallace and does fall short in numerous instances to historical verity. That said it remains a stunning achievement in film work that liberally reconstructions actual events in order to present a gripping modern epic.The entire movie is engaging but two scenes stand out: The `gift of the thistle' moment when the beautiful young Murron presents the young Wallace with a wildflower at his father's funeral. Few tableaus in film history can match the power here as the music swells in harmony with touching scene. The tremendous Stirling battle scene (though vastly historically inaccurate) is also a piece de resistance, from Wallace's rousing speech to his contempt for the English commander, from the comic relief of the mooning and flashing of the recalcitrant Scots and finally the riveting battle itself (that may only possibly be rivaled by Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landing sequence for sheer power in a battle scene). It's also notable that the script and Gibson's direction provide for a juxtaposition of this violence with the soothing powers of femininity; the bride who eases her husband's wrath sotto voce and gently pushes the adversaries blade from his throat, the lure of a life with Murron in which Wallace initially attempts to stay clear of war and the obvious benevolence of the princess.This movie is a great one and without a doubt in my top ten.",N/A
824688,"Remember David Soul and Paul Michael- Glaser in the old Starksy and Hutch action series from the 1970's? If you're trying to put it behind you, then you may not want to see this movie. But for those who loved the show and who like cheesy comedies, this 2004 big screen rendition might be for you.The stars this time around are Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the roles as David Starsky and Ken Hutchinson respectively. Stiller is a more serious character and Wilson is more laid back and funny, even bordering on stupid at times. The two don't seem to get along that well, but they end up as partners regardless as they try to complete a drug sting. Along they way, they get some help from a character named Huggy Bear, played by Snoop Dogg- one of the best parts of the film. Huggy Bear seems like a cool, slick helpful type of guy, but you don't really know whose side he is on. Snoop Dogg is, basically, playing himself in this role. He always has that cool, calm, confident demeanor no matter when I see him on the small or large screen.The music in this film comes from the 1970's, and much of it is forgettable, just like the 1970's were forgettable. One particularly nauseating scene (or funny, depending on how you look at it) has Owen Wilson taking a guitar from his partner and proceeding to play the song ""Don't Give up on Us"". Most viewers won't recognize this song at all, but it is, in fact, an old hit single from the 1970's by the original Hutch, David Soul.Some of the comedy here is funny, but other parts of the movie don't quite seem to hit the mark. However, the action scenes and the nostalgic value are enough to recommend watching this movie. It isn't the greatest, but it has enough entertainment value to make it worth paying a few dollars to see on video.",Starsky & Hutch VHS

570688,"Somewhere I read that a viewer rated this movie as having 10 stars, in part because of what it was about, but mostly because of how it made them feel. And how does it make me feel, like I am thirteen all over again. As Jesse puts it, NICE! This little gem of a movie has stayed with me for years and I surprise myself on how much of it I remember. I only saw it once 26 years ago and I still remember it as though I saw it yesterday.I have read from other comments that it was viewed as a afternoon school special in 1979. But I recall that it was shown on prime time the year before. One of those movie of the week things. I had kept, for almost 10 years, the t.v. guide clipping of the film so I know the year of the original release was 1978. On the clipping, Michael's age was written down as 19, not 17. I don't know if that was a T.V. guide error or if it was the original age his character was suppose to be and they later changed it because the age difference was larger. Sadly, the clipping is long gone, having been discarded a few years after college when I cleared my stuff from my parents place.Watching the film again brought me back to the end of eight grade when I first saw it. Being the same age as Jesse in the movie, I was just months away from turning 14. Unlike the movies, I wasn't lucky enough to get a gorgeous, rock star, boyfriend, but it was and still is fun to see how Jesse got hers. It's a rare film that lasts through the years and changing times and still packs an emotional wallop. The message remains the same. Your first love, will always be the sweetest, most fondly remembered moment.I just ordered the DVD of the movie, as well as the three books (Sooner or Later, Waiting Games, Now or Never) since I only discovered they are now available. I read from other viewer comments that the third book ends abruptly, leaving the door open for a fourth book? Seems the story of Michael and Jesse is not yet over. I hope Bruce and Carole Hart will heed our plea and conclude the Michael and Jesse story with a happy send off.The songs were wonderful, &quot;Simply Jesse&quot; being my favorite with &quot;You take my Breath Away&quot; a very close second. It's a film you can watch again and again. Though dated, it's appeal is still strong.

187261,"Well, it's been about five years since I've seen Habit but it's always stuck with me. I plan to buy the DVD and was a liitle put put back by some of the reviews that went so, so deep into the plot. Reviews should be about what the film did to you not what the film was about. At least not specifically and not in great detail, at least not without first warning the reader.Well what I got from the flick was something new as far as experiences. I'm looking at this guy who's hair is falling out right in front of me and is he???yeah he's missing some teeth.Is this our HERO, is this our protagonist? Some said the acting was bad. I don't know but what I saw was the complete absence of acting. I mean, man, this was FRESH ! ! I thought I was watching a real party in action. I was floored to find out that Larry was the everything to this little gem, writer, director, star and who knows what else.Now, I am a big fan of horror movies but I've never been much of a fan of vampire movies. I didn't like Bela or Christopher or even The Addiction, which was heavily touted. I find most of them to be really cornball. The few exceptions are of course Murnau's Nosferatu and few others but for me not much exist in the genre between 1922 and 1997.A bunch of people mention(even the good reviews) that it's slow but I don't remember that. I think maybe my memory is not serving me right or it was just that I found the whole thing so engrossing, time had no relevance(a real good indication of good filmmaking).The best I can do to explain it is Little Fugitive meets Shadow of the Vampire. Somewhere in between that you'll find  this most indie of Indie films, Habit. If you liked Slacker or Smithereens or Shadows or Kenneth Angers' films or Laws of Gravity or Repo Man or even Return to Salem's Lot, you might find this very satisfying. This is a real good answer to what ""slick"" really is when compared to, let's say, Jerry Bruckhiemer sense of ""slick"" which is really only ""gloss"". Well, I hope memory served me well enough to be seeing the gem I vaguely remember and I hope I don't let you down if I spurred your curiousity enough to watch this very different experience. If I remember correctly, it's well worth the time. All 112 mins.(Addendum)I got it and memory serve me very well but I did forget how much sex(for my money, really good)there is in this hot little movie that puts to shame so many productions costing ten or even a hundred times as much. As much as I like Innocent Blood and Devil's Advocate, this is a much better movie on a small fraction of the budget. This ain't cornball. Also, it's got REAL good music.",N/A
380569,"No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.""Children of the Corn 3: Urban Harvest"" moves far beyond the parameters established in the first film. Instead of Isaac issuing the doom and gloom prophecies of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows,"" we now have Eli (Daniel Cerny) stepping up to the plate. He and his older ""brother"" Joshua (Ron Melendez) turn up in Chicago after Joshua's father, who had the temerity to question Eli's increasingly bizarre behavior, perished in a hideous manner back on the Nebraska farm. Adopted by William Porter (Jim Metzler)--a big shot at an agricultural firm specializing in the creation of resistant grains--and his wife Amanda (Nancy Lee Grahn), Eli and Joshua seem like fish out of water in the Windy City. Right from the start it's obvious that Eli is a little strange; it is also obvious that he has some sort of weird hold over Joshua. How odd is the pint-sized preacher? His new mother opens his suitcase only to find it packed full of ears of corn covered in huge bugs. Screeching like a banshee, Alice is astonished to discover that the insects were just a hallucination of some sort. Hmmm. Anyway, Eli soon realizes that a huge, abandoned warehouse right next door to the house provides fertile ground for a few rows of special corn. This crop grows to full height in a matter of hours, is impervious to disease and other forms of damage, and tastes great.William Porter soon learns about the crop and dreams about how much money he can make selling these plants around the world, an idea encouraged by Eli. In the meantime, the two kids enroll in a Catholic school run by the kindly Father Frank Nolan (Michael Ensign). Eli continues to try and control Joshua, but his influence seems on the wane. With the help of Malcolm (Jon Clair) and his cute sister Maria (Nari Morrow), Joshua begins to emerge from his shell. He takes up basketball despite Eli's objections, and even strikes up a physical relationship with Maria. The young preacher turns his attention to the other kids in school, lecturing them about the importance of children in scripture and thus usurping Father Frank's authority. He even stands up one day during services to relate his interpretations of the holy word. Predictably, the kids soon fall under Eli's power. Joshua, with the help of Malcolm, heads back to Nebraska to unearth an important book buried there by Eli that just might help defeat the evil intentions of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" and his earthly minion. We finally see the incarnation of this demon when Eli holds a ceremony in the warehouse. The film ends on one of those ""the evil goes on even though we thought it was over"" themes.Actually, ""Children of the Corn 3"" isn't half bad. Director James D.R. Hickox is well known as a purveyor of schlocky yet entertaining low budget horror, so maybe that has something to do with it. I got a real kick out of the Eli character, who I thought looked like a miniature version of a certain ""Grease 2"" star (The movie should carry the title ""Honey, I Shrunk Adrian Zmed""). He's not as eerie as Isaac in the first one, but he does carry a certain unease about him. The guy who played Father Frank was a real hoot, too. His hysterics make Rod Steiger's priest in ""The Amityville Horror"" look tame by comparison. But what really takes the cake in ""Corn 3"" are the imaginative kill scenes and cheesy special effects. A head bursting into flames, a combination garden tool/pipe atrocity, and people torn apart by ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" insures a good time for all. The model the filmmakers used to depict the corn demon, however, looks woefully inadequate. At one point the beastie snacks on a kid, but it's so obvious that the crew stuck a doll in the creature's mouth that I howled with laughter for hours afterwards. By the way, Charlize Theron appears in a bit part as one of Eli's followers during the final showdown.Trailers for parts four, five, and six of ""Children of the Corn,"" ""Dracula 2000,"" ""Halloween: H20,"" and ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" are the only extras on the disc. I would recommend ""Children of the Corn 3"" over most of the other entries in the series. Sure, it is cheap and cheesy, but it's also a lot of fun. There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours of your time.",Children of the Corn 3 VHS
242265,"When this movie debuted in 1987, I remember that it was really hyped, so much so that I thought it was destined to be a classic.  Not so, as 17 years later, the world has pretty much forgotten it.  I rented it for the nostaglic value and found it interesting, in a neon-glowing, teased-hair sort of way...The movie revolves around three high-school friends named Clay, Blair, and Julian.  Upon graduation, each has a different plan for his or her life.  Clay heads straight to college, Blair blows off post-secondary education to pursue a modeling career, and Julian attempts to become a nightclub entrepreneur.When Clay comes for the Christmas holidays, his first holiday from college, he finds that the friendship has changed in six months, and not for the better.

Julian's addiction and loan delinquincy drag Clay and Blair with him on a downward spiral as they attempt to get him clean and run interference with Rip.

260543,"Planet of the Apes is a great ""What if"" tale. There have been oodles of movies where the heroic space travelers lurch forward in time to find earth in a completely different state. But when ""Apes"" was released and we found that the planet was ruled by monkeys, that took the cake! Charlton Heston is one of our heroic space travelers here. The theory of talking ape evolution is very interesting even if not very likely. In one of the later of the Ape series we find that humans are using apes to perform menial tasks but an uprising takes place. They are not only used as slave labor but mistreated as well. Monkey racism I guess you'd call it. That uprising is spearheaded by Ceasar, a talking chimpanzee (played by the late Roddy McDowall).The series takes us forwards and backwards to show us how the simian race was able to take over in the first place. Unfortunately, the later films in the series are not the same caliber as the first but some of you may still find them enteraining nonetheless.As for the first Ape film, you would expect that the ape makeup would count for 90% of the acting but gratefully, the acting is top notch in spite of the makeup jobs. The ending really blows you away because you're involved in the film so much that you aren't trying to figure out where the astronauts have landed. You just want to know why the monkeys are talking. Also interesting is that the apes have their own heirarchy. The gorillas are the brutes so they are all soldiers. The chimps are intelligent so they are the scientists and the orangutangs are the elite so they rule the land.There are a lot of extras here.  Good stuff, not the stuff they threw on the floor while making the film.  The documentaries are interesting to watch as well as the creation of the facial makeup.  The process was brutal.  Once the makeup was applied, the actor had to stay in it until shooting for the day was over.  If they wanted to eat, most of what they ate had to be sipped through a straw.  There are cast interviews and Roddy McDowalls home movies as well.  Lots of fun stuff here.You must have this dvd.  Get it now!",Planet of the Apes VHS

I've noticed that Judy Davis has received many negative reviews here.  I am not one of those.  Truthfully .... no one can capture the true essence of Judy but I think Judy Davis did an outstanding job!  They could have done better with the make-up.....especially during Judy's last years.....Davis looks too healthy when in truth, Judy was emaciated and her body had broken down.....Tammy Blanchard, as the young Judy is the one who gets the real kudos here......uncanny.....and she definitely captured the young Judy......Davis' and Blanchard's lip synching to Garlands music is done superbly and the film is top notch in every quality.  The young man who played Mickey Rooney was great too!!The man who played Vincente Minnelli looked to be on auto-pilot...completely wooden.  Victor Garber as Sid Luft was fine.Marsha Mason looked like Ethel Gumm and it is understandable why Judy always said her life was ruined by her mother.

855717,"MOVIE: If you were to go to The American Film Institute's website you would see that the original Manchurian Candidate sits at number 67 for the best 100 movies in the last 100 years. The only question that strikes me here is why fix something if it's not broken? The original is a political thriller about the communism scare during the Cold War. The reason it's a classic is that the movie's plot delt with the possibilty that an outside evil could be controlling us, and the film also was telling the audience that communism is a government that will hypnotize you and your life, it was a message from the film makers. This new version uses the same idea of &quot;control&quot; except that instead of pointing at communism it's pointing at the idea that we live in a corrupt world, that our government is corrupt. Okay. . .I'm pretty sure that idea has been presented before, and in reality our government is corrupt in some ways and we know that. The movie does show us an almost fictional way of how the government is being controlled and that can raise questions like &quot;does the executive branch really have the most power or are they influenced enormously by others?&quot; While the answer to that question may be simple it also may be complex. The problem with the movie here is that the issues raised in the movie are way too fictional and far out to have any reference to our daily lives. Microchips implanted in our nation's leaders' brains is something that someone would say &quot;yeah right!&quot; to. The original delt with communism, a very real threat at the time. While the new modern version has the similar formula of the original movie, the main ingredient has been changed and the flavor just doesn't seem right.ACTING: This is a movie where if they had mediocre actors then the movie would have been considered an insult to John Frankenheimer. Denzel Washington gives a very convincing performance and it adds to the effect of the movie. Meryl Streep pulls off the role of the evil mother, but I still find Angela Lansbury's performance much better. The acting was top notch overall and all that emotion was needed to keep the audience entertained. Jonathan Demme also added to the tense atmosphere by using a lot of close-ups for character shots. Everytime an actor is delivering an emotional line the camera is always focused with the chin at the bottom of the screen and the top of the head at the top of the screen. This forces the audience to focus in the actors' eyes to really get the emotion, but just the fact of having to force emotion to the audience shows that remaking a classic wasn't easy.BOTTOM LINE: What if someone said that Hollywood was going to remake Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, or Ben-Hur . . . exactly! This modern version is no match for the original classic, and even though the original may have lost its touch due to the passing of communistic fears it still holds the values that make it way better than this modern tale.",The Manchurian Candidate

616082,"When I first discovered that Disney were releasing a sequel to their greatest hit to date, Lilo &amp; Stitch, I couldn't believe it. I remember watching the original film in theatres and have loved it ever since. So obviously I had to go out and buy the sequel as soon as it came out and was I disappointed? Hell no! Strangely not a lot of others agree so but I totally agree with the points that Rezo has made. All Disney sequels that go direct to video don't bother going through the big struggle of being better than the first. Obviously this is no exception, but it's a bloody good effort, and it's undoubtedly unfair to compare this to the original film, which is what I'm not doing.This film is brilliant. It doesn't have the feel of a sequel when you finish watching it, and technically it is just a way to start off the TV series, but I can very easily enjoy it as both. The qualities of the first film include all the fantastic voice talents returning, which isn't that common for something that goes straight to video, especially with such names like Tia Carrere, Kevin McDonald and Ving Rhames, and the fact that its unique style of comedy that made the first film such a success has been superbly recreated here. Let's now divide its details:StorylineMany sequels are poor rehashes with exactly the same storyline as before, films like Jungle Book 2 for example, but this one has a clever story to it. Stitch is experiment 626, and here begins the discovery of his 625 older 'cousins'. The new evil Badguy, Dr. Hamsterviel, who you can't help but feel sorry for in the end, teams up with Gantu, who's just been fired from his job, and kidnaps Jumba for his share of the collection. But Lilo and Stitch won't stop there, because for both of them, ohana still means nobody gets left behind. And because the mention of ohana is a key element in Lilo and Stitch, the sequel spaces the feeling out for both worlds. Whereas the first film explaining the situation of Lilo's family, Stitch! The Movie is more based on Stitch's.AnimationBecause it precedes a TV show, the watercolour backgrounds of the original can't be reused. But for television and straight to video, it's not really that bad. Kids won't care as long as they have the characters they love on the screen, and adults shouldn't care as long as they have the humour of the original's brilliance.VoicesApart from Jason Scott Lee, who is replaced by Dee Bradley Baker as David, they all came back and they all do well. The new voice of David does a great performance, and Tia Carrere is still good as Nani. Also the dating interest seems to be getting better between them despite Nani's doubts. David Ogden Stiers and Kevin McDonald as Jumba and Pleakley spare us more wit this time around, as well as Ving Rhames (Cobra) and Kevin Michael Richardson (Gantu) being as stunningly cool as before. As for previous voices, the amazing, should-be-Oscar-nominated, Daveigh Chase is the best of the lot as Lilo for the second film running, with the Grandcouncil Woman's Zoe Caldwell coming a very close second, in front of Gantu, Cobra and Pleakley.In the department of new voices, Jeff Bennett is hilarious as the fantastic new villian Hamsterviel, and Rob Paulsen fits the part of 625 perfectly.HumourA reprisal from the new style of comedy brought along by the first film that has been winningly used to offer no signs of disappointment in this area. There's also a great use of the Peter Gunn theme put in here for extra effect on those who were impressed with all the comedic nostalgia references in the first film.To finalise, listen to everything I've said, and take some of Rezo's advice, and watch it that way. Chances are you won't nearly be as disappointed as the many others. Think of it as The Matrix Reloaded, it's not as good as number one, but definitely a necessary release as there is now a series and talk of a third film. Sandwich, anyone?",N/A

774128,"""Eight Crazy Nights"" is like an animated holiday special as it might be envisioned and conceived by the Farrelly Brothers - rude, crude, vulgar, yet surprisingly conformist in its values and themes.The people actually responsible for the film are director Seth Kearsley, and writers Brooks Arthur, Allen Covert, Brad Isaacs and Adam Sandler.  Sandler also provides the voice for the lead character, Davey Stone, a 30-something curmudgeon who hates the holidays and goes out of his way to ruin them for everyone else.  As a public menace, Davey finds himself assigned by court order to assist a sweet, but addled septuagenarian who coaches a youth basketball team.Part of the fun of ""Eight Crazy Nights"" comes from the strange dichotomy between the film's crude humor and the picture postcard small town setting.  This film looks like every Christmas special ever made, yet when the characters open their mouths...well, all I can say is that ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" or ""Frosty the Snowman"" this ain't.  Some people may be offended by the antics contained in this film, and it is certainly not recommended viewing for very small children.  But the film is really no worse in tone than the average Sandler comedy and the humor is nothing that every prepubescent boy hasn't heard or even indulged in himself (though the scatological sequences involving some deer are a bit much).  In fact, one of the criticisms that can be leveled against the film is that it really isn't raunchy enough, that it wants to have it both ways.  It wants to come across as a daring and iconoclastic image-buster, yet it can't resist employing the very same heart tugs that virtually all other holiday films employ and which this film is supposed to be a reaction against.  Unlike, say, ""South Park,"" which makes no concessions to sentimentality, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" loses its nerve and becomes just another warm-hearted and cuddly holiday-themed film at the end.  That's too bad because we really could use a corrosive tonic long about this time of the year.  After all who decreed that all holiday films had to be pure sweetness and light?  Isn't running over grandma with a reindeer also a holiday tradition?Still, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" does have some very shrewd, very clever, very funny moments contained within it, enough to almost compensate for the conventional gooey ending - and it does a nice job parodying the musical interludes generally found in more conventional Disney-type animated features as well.  Moreover, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" has historical significance in that it is the first movie I can remember in which Chanukah achieves equal billing with Christmas.  That's a long overdue correction, I must say, although I'm just not sure that Jewish mothers quite had this in mind when they envisioned it finally happening.  Oy vay!",N/A

795636,"Back in my high school days, I used to give dudes like Jack Black severe wedgies.  Sure, the 'Jack Black' types were the pudgy urchins who loved nothing better than to push the envelope, but they were still annoying enough to disrupt a grand party or, sin of sins, make a pass at a preppy girl.  Thus, the wedgies were administered, while those of us on the superficial side of the intellectual chain couldn't help but admire the 'stick it to the man' mentality of these Pillsbury doughboys.Hence the appeal of THE SCHOOL OF ROCK, a cute little flick that allows beady-eyed Jack Black to romp and chomp and stomp through a formulaic, totally predictable plot.  As rock superstar wannabe Dewey Finn, Black plays a loose cannon (er, himself) who is short on talent, but long on rock 'n roll fantasy.  When his band dumps him, and he finds himself behind on his rent, he steals the identity of his zombie roommate and pretends to be a 5th grade teacher at a prim and proper prep school.  He has zero teaching skills, but--lucky for him--he does recognize he's been given a class of pre-adolescents who collectively possess the talent he needs to live out his dream:  to put together a kick arse rock band.And so the school's curriculum is tossed overboard like a bucket of shrimp to sharks, as Dewey shapes and nurtures and cultivates his young charges into a stage band extraordinaire.  Granted, the 'suspension of disbelief' police come calling (How can all of these 10-year-olds be so obscenely talented?), yet Black shamelessly--or better yet, shamefully--pulls everything together as he enters his new creation into a 'Battle of the Bands' contest.  He also collectively pulls the wool over the eyes of the prep school's administration, along with the parents of his new entourage.  By the time Dewey is ""outed,"" it's too late:  The School of Rock is on center stage, playing a gig that brings down the house.Jack Black carries this movie on his nine-course shoulders; Joan Cusack, who plays Black's hesitant, somewhat suspicious supervisor, so reminds me of a great date I once had that I wanted no one else to know about.  As mentioned before, the plot is predictable, even lame, but THE SCHOOL OF ROCK entertains, simply because rock is rock--even when being played by diaper dandies.  Stay with this film 'til the closing credits:  You will be amply rewarded with a great jam session.--D. Mikels",School of Rock

443702,"I am a huge fan of Elmore Leonard, the author of &quot;Rum Punch,&quot; the novel on which this movie was based, so naturally, I had high expectations.  I was not disappointed.  Robert Forster is EXCELLENT, deserving of the Oscar nomination.  Samuel L. Jackson once again steals the show, he dominates every scene.  I cannot think of anyone else who could play Ordell Robbie than Jackson.  I read &quot;Rum Punch&quot; about a year before the movie came out, and I actually envisioned Jackson as Robbie as I was reading.  And who better to direct this Leonard classic than Tarantino?  Every scene sizzles, the music is PERFECT, the camera angles are brilliant, and the dialogue is a non-stop assault that held me spellbound.  I can't understand why people compare this to &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and critisize it so harshly.  If Tarantino put out one movie a year and had 12 or 15 or 20 movies, then I could understand putting it up against &quot;his best.&quot;  Fortunately, Tarantino only has 4 movies (if you count &quot;Kill Bill vols. 1 and 2 as one movie.) and all four movies are treasures, each as enjoyable to me as the others.  I don't have a favorite Tarantino movie.  On another note, I'd like to see Tarantiono make another Leonard novel into a movie.  &quot;Pronto&quot; is one of my favorites and it would make a spectacular movie, since over half of the story takes place in Italy on the Meditteranean.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  (let's just hope the next Leonard novel brought to the silver screen is not a disappointment, &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; was one of my favorite Leonard books, his first crime novel, but it was recently butchered on screen.  I am aware that &quot;Be Cool,&quot; the sequel to &quot;Get Shorty&quot; will be out soon and, while &quot;Be Cool&quot; is among my least favorite Leonard novels (I have read 26 of them) I am expecting a good movie.",Jackie Brown VHS

626608,"This is one of the blandest movies I've ever seen. Its not so much that its bad as it is wholly uninteresting. Kate Hudson isn't so much nauseating as dull. John Corbett- the ""love interest""  doesnt look like he wants to be there, let alone be stuck courting the pouty ding-bat that Hudson plays. The only decent acting was Joan Cusack who just gets dumped on the whole movie. The plot was weak and frivolous with no surprises and a lame obvious ending- big surprise- the girl and the guy get together and it all miraculously works out.Other than Cusack, the characters were hollow, the performances were weak (but what else could be done with such a powder puff script?), and the whole thing splashed around in the shallow end of the emotional pool... much like my interest.The story doesn't drag, but you may find yourself wishing you had those two hours of your life back.""Look at me- I'm depressed.

Scary Movie was sick, and not entirely funny.  The script, the idea, and the concept were not worth putting on film.  It may have raked in some cash, but if the movie industry is not going to care about film quality and greatness, and only about money and box office revenue, the film industry may has well stop making movies all together.

16105,"I thought I was going to enjoy this film, when I saw that Bruce Willis was looking mighty fine on the cover, but when I started watching it, the only thing I was really watching it for Bruce Willis. The storyline was quite interesting, but the rest of the characters just weren't.Andie MacDowell, for some reason, I just don't like. Hudson Hawk was released in 1991, and 13 years on, she looks the exact same. In the continuous rubbish commercials that she puts out, when it's perfectly obvious she's using something a lot stronger than skin firming cream. Give me a break.I quite liked the appearance by Richard E Grant in this, and I would have much preferred him by himself, until that thing came along, and over-acted and over exaggerated her way into the bad acting world. So much so that I can't bear to mention her name. If Richard had been by himself, it would have been so much better.I normally like Bruce Willis films, but in this, he seemed to be constantly winking at the camera - and you say the cast of Friends were bad at this?! And he's ruined forever for me by singing. It wouldn't have been so bad, if he hadn't sung it so overly camp, and done all these stupid moves (no one say a word about Steps) Sure sometimes, he may come across as funny, but if you're used to seeing him in so much better films, then you'll probably be on my side.Most of the time, the film can't decide what it wants to be - a parody full of puns, or a true to heart action movie. Igg & Ook are just like the twins in the Matrix movies, only better. There are some extremely stupid and unbelieveable scenes, one being 'Hawk' falling out of the sky, bouncing off a street light and landing in a chair in the cafe at the exact time he's supposed to meet a woman?! That wouldn't happen.I suppose this should have been a film that makes you laugh, and notice all the little in jokes (like Sylvester Stallone's brother, which totally went over my head), or try and figure out what Igg & Ook's last words were, when they don't actually speak. And of course you've got that thing in it. Take out that, make Bruce Willis not sing, and the film might have been slightly better. Or you could just skip the rest of the movie, and watch the scenes where he wears his hat, or manages to steal all those art pieces, with not very much effort.",N/A
745007,"Darkness Falls (Jason Liebesman, 2003)Somehow I never got round to reviewing this. Which is okay, because everyone's already said everything I have to say about it, but hey.This movie is probably going to end a lot of careers before they begin, and could have deleterious effects on a few others. I watched it (well, because I like bad horror movies) mostly because Emma Caulfield is hot and I could never stand enough of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to get a good enough fix. This ain't much better, but at least I could sit through it.The Tooth Fairy (Antony Burrows in his big-screen debut, also a stuntman for the lead actor: what a surprise, a stuntman playing a monster) is a ghost who's been exceptionally pissed at a small town for a hundred fifty years. Every time a child loses his first tooth, he's visited by the tooth fairy, and if he's not asleep... well, trauma. Or the brutal and bloody murder of one's parents which then gets pinned on the kid, as happened to Kyle Walsh (Legally Blonde's Chaney Kley). Kyle, not surprisingly, split town after that for a while. No one believes in the Tooth Fairy (of course), and they all think Kyle's nuts (of course), but he comes back to town to save the son of his high school sweetheart, Caitlin (Caulfield). He's being stalked by the Tooth Fairy, as well.First, just to get this out of the way: enough with the new age psychology crap already. Oh, boy, childhood trauma. Yeah, that hasn't been horribly overdone. (No one uses the words ""inner child,"" but they're written all over Kley's face throughout. Try not to puke.)Second, pretty much everything bad you can say about this movie, well, you can say. The acting is hideous, the pace is off, the jumps out of your seat feel more like you settling your butt deeper into the chair. I was more scared by the last Mary Kate and Ashley movie.That said, there are two very above-average things about this flick. The special effects are tremendous, as is to be expected; the Tooth Fairy was designed by Stan Winston. Nuff said. Also, the direction has something going for it. Had Liebesman been able to put together as good a cast as found in, say, The Ring (or even as good a bad cast as found in, say, Cabin Fever), this might have been a wonderful little sleeper. Liebesman uses light and dark like he's working with a palette. Given enough time, he could be approaching the talent of David Lynch or early David Fincher.

This is King's biggest novel...and I know he knows it's his best. The 8 hour TV version does well on DVD at only 6 hours (minus commercials). To tell the story in less time would be a travesty. The acting is generally fine, with Sheridan as a standout. I liked Ruby Dee a lot, and thought Rob Lowe was fine. A brief tough-as-nails cameo by Kathy Bates was great.

581716,"""The Wild Child"" was directed by Francois Truffaut and released in 1970. Truffaut has made some extraordinary movies, such as the Antoine Doinel series and ""Jules et Jim."" Unfortunately, this movie is given relatively little recognition, even though it truly is first-rate. Based on a true story, the movie concerns Victor, l'enfant sauvage - a boy found in the wilds of France. Truffaut cast himself as Dr. Jean Itard an 18th century physician who helps &quot;tame&quot; and educate the boy. Initially branded an ""idiot"" and uneducable by local townspeople, Victor is helped immensely by Dr. Itard through his humane treatment.The story is fascinating and quite gripping. In addition, the movie raises interesting questions regarding &quot;civilized&quot; behavior and ethics, as it compares Victor to various people in the town. Although similar stories has been told elsewhere (e.g., Herzog's ""Every Man for Himself""), Truffaut manages to put his own interesting spin on the tale.  Further, his direction is masterful, and he won Best Director from the National Board of Review. The film was made in black and white, which adds great realism to the story - it looks terrific (It won Best Cinematography from the National Society of Film Critics).

Mainly like tournament of death 2 or soon, 3. So, if you are into bloody out of control near death so called wrestling, get this DVD when it comes out. I promise you, it will be so worth it.",N/A

The youngest daughter of the Family Bhamra (Anupam Kher & Shaheen Khan), Jess is disobedient to her parents and the traditional, old school ways of Sikh.Jess just happens to be a very gifted football (soccer) player and hatches a plan to go behind her parents backs to play on the London girl's professional football team along with her friend and teammate Juliette 'Jules' Paxton, played by Keira Knightley. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Joe, the dreamy football coach that both of the girls fall for and fight over.But, as the girl's team starts to gain some media attention, Jess's secret can't be kept forever!Mr. Bhamra tries to hammer home to Jess that a Sikh is measured by his quality and NOT quantity that he is a small or a big man. So, in a Sikh, it is what comes out of his mouth that matters as it reflects the quality of learning. Disobedience, lying, and above all, interracial relationships are NOT ALLOWED!Mrs. Bhamra only prays for her youngest daughter to be a normal Sikh young woman, betrothed to a good Sikh young man, and of course, hopes that she can cook a good Aloo Gobi. (Recipe included in the extras of the DVD! How CUTE!)Jess is grasping to be her own person while still holding true to her faith and upbringing.  Jess doesn't want to leave her new, more independent way to live her life for the other, more traditional way of life. All the way through the film she strives to blend the two together in harmony while trying desperately to honor her parents, her family obligations, ties and traditions.This film is more than a teen, feel good, sports movie.  It has the great quality of breaking stereotypes, old traditions, and acceptance, above all...Happy Watching!",Bend It Like Beckham

For my money Lucio Fulci made 4 great horror films-Zombie,Gates of Hell, House by the Cemetary, and this, his ultimate, The Beyond. I never dreamed something like this would ever come out on DVD, especially with the special edition treatment this got. The picture and sound are awesome. This is the kind of movie that is so great for pissing off your girlfriend (or wife.) This is one of my favorite horror films of all time and I didn't even see this until about 1995! With the new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack this now has, its almost as much fun to crank up as Suspiria (the greatest horror film of them all.)

386913,"None other than the leftist fire breather Michael Moore lensed &quot;Canadian Bacon,&quot; a film that turned into a huge box office bomb. That should serve as the first warning to potential viewers interested in viewing this film. If it doesn't, many other red flags pop up as the movie unfolds. Apparently, some genius in Hollywood thought Moore's documentaries meant that the guy could do a feature film. Wrong. &quot;Canadian Bacon,&quot; while boasting an occasionally funny scene or two, is nothing more than propaganda served up on a celluloid bun. The film stars Alan Alda, Kevin Pollack, John Candy (in one of his last film performances, a fact in and of itself noteworthy for fans of the Canadian comedian), Rhea Perlman, Rip Torn, G.D. Spradlin, Stephen Wright, and a host of other familiar faces. With a cast like this, you would think the movie would be an outright tour de force. Wrong again. Before watching this film, you should probably join the National Rifle Association, vote Republican, or simply fly an American flag for a few weeks. Whatever you do, do something to offset this unpleasant slice of good old left wing hate.Alan Alda plays an American president in trouble with the voting public. With the end of the Cold War and the attendant downsizing of the defense industry, lots of red-blooded American citizens are now out of work, and unemployed workers tend to vote for the other guy. What is a corrupt politician to do? According to Moore, the solution lies in creating a new enemy against which the American people can rally. After a failed attempt to restart a conflict with the tottering Soviet Union, the president and his slimy advisors set their sights on Canada. Urged on by his National Security Advisor Stuart Smiley (Pollack) and General Richard Panzer (Torn), the president sets into motion a flurry of anti-Canadian measures. Before too long, the media joins the fray by broadcasting thinly veiled slurs against the Great White North. An ugly incident at a hockey game in Canada, where American Sheriff Bud Boomer (Candy) starts a riot when he casts an aspersion on Canadian beer, further stokes the fires back home. Everything is really starting to work in the president's favor: the voters rapidly forget about the nation's economic troubles and begin arming themselves to stave off a possible invasion from Canada.When a few Americans decide to take matters into their own hands and invade Canada themselves, the real trouble starts. Bud Boomer, his girlfriend Honey (Perlman), and a few other brain dead hicks sneak across the border to cause a little disturbance. When some Canadian cops interrupt the fun, the Americans flee back into the United States without realizing they left Honey behind. This mistake leads Boomer and his companions to reinvade Canada in search of their beloved woman, a mission loaded with lots of humorous situations comparing the stupidity and aggressiveness of Americans with the simplicity and friendliness of Canadians. Meanwhile, back in Washington, D.C., the evil corporate boss R.J. Hacker (Spradlin) spurs the White House on in their fake little war games. He tells Stuart Smiley that he sold the Canadians a doomsday device that has the capacity to launch American missiles at the former Soviet Union. Hacker will sell the code to defuse the weapon to the government for a paltry sum of a few billion dollars. What started out as a political ploy to carry the next election has suddenly turned into a scenario involving all out nuclear war.I am willing to overlook a bit of cant in a movie from time to time, but the avalanche of propaganda in &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; is simply a wonder to behold. Moore skewers everything he hates about America: guns, the military, corporations, the media, patriots, and just about everything else under the sun. R.J. Hacker comes off as a power mad lunatic, the politicians are manipulative cynics, and the movie tars the average American with a generous coating of stupidity and blind patriotism. The latter is surprising since Moore consistently presents himself as the mouthpiece of the downtrodden American worker. But there is the director himself in one scene of the movie, carrying an assault rifle and mouthing jingoistic platitudes about wiping out the Canadians as if to put an exclamation point on his messages. As difficult as it is to swallow these sequences of truly nauseating hate, the movie as a whole is even worse because it isn't funny. Sure, a few scenes made me laugh out loud: the CIA spook outlining the sinister secrets of Canada is a real hoot, as are several of the encounters between Boomer's &quot;army&quot; and Canadian citizens. Overall, however, the movie tanks due to its shrill tone.The American public knew better than to buy into this junk when the movie opened back in the mid 1990s. Moore's recent popularity has inspired a few revisionists to resurrect this mediocre effort in order to sing its praises. Most people who speak about &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; now refer to its prescience concerning the existing administration in the White House--and do so without a trace of irony--as though America's forty-second president didn't try and distract the public from his scandal plagued regime by launching missiles into Afghanistan and Africa. I admit Moore scores some points in this movie, but those barbs jab both ways, folks. Watch &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; for a few select scenes and try to ignore the movie as a whole.",Canadian Bacon VHS
784008,"OK, the title is a little suck-up sounding and was more or less meant as a play on words but in some ways not. As far as political commentators/entertainers go, most just don't get it. The majority of celebrity ilk who think that they have some politcal axe to grind fail miserably at everything except constant sloganeering. It's almost as if they see it in a magazine or on a sign at a protest and they simply repeat it everywhere that they go. Then, there are a small group that pay attention to what is going on, ask questions, demand answers and make suggestions. This is what sets Bill Maher apart from the armchair activists in the entertainment business. While you have Michael Moore on one side and Rush Limbaugh on the other screaming at each other that they are always right, Bill Maher steps far away from the namecalling and posturing and more or less strives to engage in a discussion on not who's necessarily right but how do we fix what has been broken.Through humor and keen insight, Bill Maher breaks down his views on the day's most pressing issues and offers up ideas on how to really fight terrorism through everything from separating religion from state to boycotting diamond purchases. Initially; and especially if you take the conservative word for it, one might gather that Bill Maher is a &quot;liberal&quot;. In truth, he is a liberal but not even close to the way that most of Holloywood leans. Bill Maher cuts through the fat and gets to the heart of the matter and in the end, his opinions really lean neither right or left but Bill Maher has more or less created a niche all his own which seemingly leaves him open to a barrage of criticism but as one quickly discovers, he's all too ready to defend himself with a large success rate.My favorite part of the DVD is the Q &amp; A Session where he takes a series of questions from his audience. It is so very rare when someone with a certain modicum of fame gives his fans the floor to voice their opinions and concerns and Bill Maher approaches this segment in a very even-handed and rationale manner and for that, I tip my hat to him. He proves himself gracious and humble and that earns a monster amount of respect.Despite what trappings conservatives have set for him, Bill Maher does a splendid job of dodging them all and proving that liberal doesn't have to equal the steroetypes that; unfortunately, many famous liberals espouse in droves. Bill Maher is a stand alone person who deserves to be heard by anyopne who thinks.",Bill Maher - Victory Begins at Home
298222,"I just received this dvd today and I'm really amazed by the quality, very nice colors and sharpness. Only minor thing is that it's in mono and not stereo (or even better: 5.1 surround). But they've really cleaned this movie up, and I think they have slightly changed the music in the beginning of the series. This is such a beautiful love story and it grabs you from the start. Father Ralph is so torn between his love of God and his love for Meggie. Mary Carson seems to know from the beginning that something's going on between Meggie and Ralph (she herself is in love with Ralph), even if it's not really love at this point in time. But as soon as Meggie Cleary steps into Mary's house you notice the hostility between them even if Meggie is just a child and Mary is old enough to be her grandmother. The mistakes that Meggie's mother Fiona made as a mother (by not loving her daughter as much as she should), those same mistakes are made by Meggie towards her own daughter later on in life. You learn from your parents. I was 12 years old when I saw the series for the first time and it's stuck with me for all these years. It's really a heartbreaking story.

683449,"This movie is great, and one of the oddest films i've seen in awhile, much like the book. What's amazing is the book is put in modern times with the same story and it works. I'm so glad that they didn't stray from the book, as most Shakespeare movies do; they keep it true as the author meant. Another great thing about this movie is that it is fantastically acted. Phifer is fantastic as Othello, and puts on screen all the rage that reading just can't act out. His anger, as written in the book, is portrayed very, very well. And Julia Stiles also is fantastic as his lover whom he loves, and with whom she loves just as much, yet can't do anything about the unknown false information that Othello(oden) is being fed. He's suspicious and she has no idea why. if only his jealousy wouldn't have gotten so far, but it did...What's so true about the movie, and book, is that the one who does wrong always gets off the easy way. Everyone dies but the criminal, everyone faces his punishment, yet the irony is the criminal is the one that faces no pain. IT is amazing irony. Good movie",O

614985,"This movie is a perfect choice if you enjoy dark comedy and nuanced pranks it will appeal to your senses, in many ways offering numerous stabs at the supposed greatness of wealth and ""the grass is always greener"" theory.Two co-workers drive to work everyday in their daily stupor each suggesting stupid ideas on how to get rich. Jack Black is toned down in his role as the man who invents a way to eliminate doggy waste and his sad side kick, played by Ben Stiller, sort of wallows in his waste. The two friends develop different personalities as they experience success and the inevitable jealousy of the left behind. Black and Stiller are great together darkly conveying the excesses of human nature to a tee. Their wives (Amy Poehler and Rachel Weisz) are just as crazy and succumb to the pull of a padded paycheck. As Black increases his wealth and fame Stiller and his family sulk in despair and desire what exists on the other side. Offering further comic relief is Christopher Walken as a conniving homeless man who befriends Stiller at one of his lowest moments.While this film isn't a laugh out loud fest it is entertaining in a subtle way. Anyone who passes a mansion and wishes for what it contains can relate to the understated stabs at the principles of the wealthy and the wake they leave in their pompous paths. Both Black and Stiller are perfect at pretending to be serious while simmering with dark laughter. The lesson found in this film is one of American excess, fast, furious and often coming from crap only to fail the system that brought it to existence in the first place. So don't be too envious when the grass grows a little greener we all need a little fertilizer now and then.",Envy

The pacing was perfect and it was fun finding out what went wrong in their relationship through backwards story telling.  Dunst is simply beautiful.

807530,"First off, I have to agree with one of the other reviews thatcriticizes the sound mix.  I don't have a multi-speaker setup,or DTS capability, just a great sounding SONY TV.  Watching theDVD on just the TV, the sound is strange.  The keyboards are upway too high in the mix, sometimes almost drowning Jane out inthe uptempo songs if you use the 5.1 mix.  If you switch to&quot;Dolby Stereo&quot;, it's much better and clearer.  But on the song&quot;You Don't Know How Beautiful You Are&quot;, her voice is completelyobscured by her keyboard player's vocals on the chorus. This isthe first DVD I've had this problem on.HOWEVER, and this is a BIG however, if you are a fan, this DVDis absolutely essential.  On most of the songs, where the voiceis front and center, Jane is absolutely spellbinding.  I was abig fan back in her early years, but kind of lost interest dueto some of the shall we say &quot;corny&quot; choice of material.  To tellyou the truth, I hadn't really paid a lot of attention after herthird album until the last year or so.  I must say that Jane'ssinging is warmer and more amazing than ever.  You can tell thather range is slightly lower, but that's natural with the passingof time.  It is more than made up for by her still-gorgeous tone,her wise phrasing and her surprisingly welcoming stage presence.I saw her Carnegie Hall debut in 1977 (78?) and she kind of leftme cold.  The Jane Olivor on this DVD is full of warmth and goodhumor, and you can tell she is loving every minute of the show.My favorite performances are &quot;Pretty Girl&quot;, &quot;Some EnchantedEvening&quot;, &quot;How Are Things In Glocca Morra&quot;, &quot;Stay The Night&quot;and a (for her) jazzy version of &quot;I Got The Sun In The Morning&quot;.It's a wonderful show, and her voice sounds as beautiful anddelicate at the end of the show as it did at the beginning.Welcome Back, Jane!One quibble:  Don't people get dressed up to go ANYWHERE thesedays?

This has cool action and I gotta admit, I was laughing a lot at the jokes, pretty much: cool movie, cool action, funny jokes.  This might have a lot of talking, but that's good because it adds story to his life and how bad it's going right now and him wanting to be with Mary Jane Watson but can't right now and her with another guy.

280734,"GASLIGHT is finally on DVD!  And not just the 1944 suspense classic.  This edition includes the complete British GASLIGHT made just a few years before in 1940.  For years MGM actively supressed the older film giving rise to the legend that it was a far superior film.  Now finally film buffs can view both and decide for themselves.Both are terrific movies.  For me, while the British version is leaner and faster, the Cukor film is by far the greater of the two.  The relationship between Walbrook and Wynyard in the 1940 version is a well-played but two dimensional depiction of a tormentor and his victim.  Boyer's and Bergman's characters are more complex and subtle in the 1944 film.  There is a genuine romantic/sexual energy between them.  While Boyer is sinister he also very charming and attractive. And you watch as the once-vibrant Bergman gives up her self confidence and becomes emotionally dependent on Boyer a little bit at a time.  And what can you say about the amoral delinquent maid of Angela Lansbury?  That alone is worth the price of admission!A great movie and a very good movie.

But in the sense that the film(along with it's stunningly pulsating soundtrack), never ever ever EVER EVER leaves your head and heart.This movie follows me daily, more so than my own shadow.Requiem is the most depressing film I've ever watched.My mother couldn't sleep for a whole night after seeing it.It is an absolute nightmare-graphic and shocking and visually uninhibited to the very extent.It's not so much the content of the film, as the entire atmosphere of it-you'll be so depressed by the end that you'll wonder whether there's a meaning to this life.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie at night-it's hard to get a good night's slep afterwards.I cannot stress this enough-it is nothing short of a living nightmare and will leave you on the verge of a suicide attemptThat said, this movie can be summed up in two words-horrific and heartbraking.It is so heartbraking, that your stomach hurts and your heart aches, and all you can think of is these characters' descent into their own private hell.But that's what drugs are.I believe it impossible to make a witty, or darkly comic movie about drugs.Drugs are a nightmare-they take over your soula and mind, and destroy every shred of humanity within you-addiction in general is just that, although that all depends what you're addicted to.That is like watching a film about rape and complaining that the rape scene was &quot;too difficult&quot;.Did it ever occur to you that maybe rape is a little difficult.By the end, Requiem no longer feels like a movie, but like a living nightmare with a very sad core.It is the most stunning,powerful, horrifying,heartbraking, unbelievably mind-numbingly,heart-achingly,stomach-chrningly unforgettable film I've ever seen,",Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut
794421,"It just goes to show that when you think you've seen everything, something comes along to prove you wrong. Such is the case with CHARLEY BOWERS: THE REDISCOVERY OF AN AMERICAN GENIUS. I had heard of Bowers before as two of the offerings on this 2 DVD set have appeared elsewhere (NOW YOU TELL ONE is in the SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA set and the cartoon A.W.O.L can be found in the Library of Congress' ORIGIN OF FILM collection) but I had no idea of the depth and breadth of the man's abilities. Bowers began as an animator around 1912 with a series of MUTT AND JEFF cartoons. One of them GRILL ROOM EXPRESS is in this collection. By the mid 20's he had moved into live comedy shorts looking like a cross between Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon with a little Larry Semon thrown in for good measure. He combined live action with stop motion animation and the most surreal series of puppet characters since the great Russian animator Ladislaw Starewicz.With the coming of sound he cut back appearing in his own material and began animating for others. A good example of this is PETE ROLEUM AND HIS COUSINS done for the young Joseph Losey. Charley Bowers died in 1946 at the age of 57 after many years of poor health. While it is not unusual to for an artist to be forgotten during his lifetime or shortly after his death, it seems incomprehensible that Bowers could have been so completely forgotten considering the originality of his material. Part of it may be that none of his work was done for a major studio who would have kept better tabs on it. Whatever the reasons for his obscurity, I shall always be grateful to the French for his rediscovery and for this 2 DVD setI can't remember the last time I laughed so hard or was so amazed as I was by some of these shorts especially EGGED ON and  SAY AH-H! although they are all first rate. It seems a shame to have to criticize this set as we are lucky to have any of this material and so much of it in really good shape. However the lack of musical accompaniment for two of the shorts on Disc 2 is really unfortunate given the musical options offered on Disc 1 and could easily have been rectified. It also would have been nice if they could have reinstated the English intertitles (most of the shorts were discovered in France and so they are in French) and that is why I give this set 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless if you're a fan of silent comedy or are looking for something truly different, buy this right away and discover the surreal genius of Charley Bowers. You will be truly amazed.",N/A

755233,"If you're interested in this anime because you like animation or you find the drawing on the cover appealing let me warn you: This is based on a manga, that as of yet is not completed. That means that the first three episodes here introduce our heroines and sort of gets the ball rolling as it were and then all of a sudden BAM! It ends after episode four. Only it doesn't really end. You see, one of the characters apparantly gets sucked into a giant whale like alien, and something really weird happens, and I'm not sure, but I think one of the main characters was seen lying dead in a pool of her own blood in the end?! Meanwhile a weird plot is slowly unfurling in the background about some alien stuff and their trainer seems to be involved somehow... Clearly as you can see, not a lot of answers are given at this early stage, yet it must be noted that the series is very well drawn, the animation is of a very high quality and provided there's more episodes coming in the future, I certainly plan to stick around. Also there are plenty of special features on the disc so you do get your money's worth.Originally I was gonna give this 3 stars only but I just can't do it. Anyone who comes up with the idea of putting frog-like aliens on the heads of three 6th graders and then have them rollerscating around after weird vegetablelike aliens with nets and dart guns deserves 4 stars for originality.

819897,"I read the book while on vacation on Cape Hatteras over the summer and loved it despite its tendency to be a bit on the technical side. There's really not much of that to hamper the movie version. Not a lot of jargon, just good storytelling.The reenacted footage moves seamlessly in and out of the dialogue by Joe Simpson and Simon Yates which, really, is every bit as fascinating as the actors' portrayals.The only reason I'm not giving ""Touching the Void"" 5 Stars, and I must admit this is very elusive, is because something didn't quite make me cringe when Joe broke his leg, or feel his desperation when Simon cut his rope, or as he dragged himself down off Siula Grande and across the glacier.Maybe it's simply that it's hard to feel all that much sympathy for him, since he knew the risks. More likely it's that Simpson's descriptions in the book were so riveting and I was spoiled.Otherwise, a great movie for armchair climbers or even those that are not all that fascinated with climbing. Now, if I can just get my wife to give it a go, I know she'd like it too (though she would never admit it).",Touching the Void
693012,"Invasion USA is essentially the grand-daddy of all nuclear war movies, a remarkable film released in 1953 that almost certainly proved frightening to movie audiences of that era.  Nowadays, the film exudes an aura of campiness and, depending on one's political viewpoint, draws either laughs or respect (and sometimes both).  Invasion USA is definitely a Cold Warriors movie, an unforgettable piece of cinematic propaganda that turned its spotlights clearly on the threat of the Red menace.  Making liberal use of stock footage from World War II, this movie not only offers a vision of Communist invasion but explains why such an invasion might succeed, thus rallying the American people not to retreat into post-war isolationism and materialism.  The price of freedom is eternal vigilance, and this is the message Invasion USA conveyed rather impressively.I happen to think this movie is brilliant.  I was born in 1970, and I knew the fear of nuclear war as a child.  For those living in the 1950s, the fear of nuclear was an even more pervasive threat - as was Communism.  I still hate Communism with every fiber of my being, and for me personally the Cold War will not end until the number of Communists in the world falls all the way to zero.  The generation coming of age today does not truly know the gnawingly pervasive threat of intercontinental nuclear war nor do today's youth remember a world in which the USSR not only existed but cast dark shadows across many parts of the world.  To many today, the Red Scare conjures up comical images of a fanatical Joseph McCarthy and the John Birch Society looking for Communists under rocks and park benches.  Invasion USA will thus strike many viewers today as rather silly, but I regard this as, to some degree, an educational film that offers an insightful look into the American mind of the 1950s.  Certainly, the characters are rather two-dimensional, the dialogue is unintentionally funny on several occasions, and the ending is likely to produce a few groans among modern audiences, but the film's theme and message is not only historically informative but still, in the broadest sense, relevant and instructive.The setup and &quot;kicker&quot; plot twist at the end may well leave one with a bad taste in his/her mouth initially, but Invasion USA is still capable of resonating over time in the minds of those who see it.  It is really an unusual film in more ways than one.  Not only does it offer a frightening vision of America subjugated by an unnamed yet ruthless and easily identifiable enemy, it assigns the blame for this possible future defeat on a populace of men and women too concerned with their own lives and desires to look out for the interests of the nation.  One of the characters in the film, for example, is a wealthy tractor manufacturer who just turned down a government request to produce needed military tanks, putting profit above patriotism.  Complacency and the voluntary wearing of blinders among a population sick of world wars is shown to be the weakest link in America's contemporary defense.  Everybody complains about taxes, concentrates solely on their own needs, and goes about his/her life pretending that America could never possibly be attacked - script writer Robert Smith clearly communicated the dangerous vulnerability implicit in such a worldview.  Invasion USA is a clarion call to a prosperous people courting danger by avoiding a frightening truth.  The film was amazingly effective in delivering this crucial and timely warning to its audience.  The same message applies in our own world; while the threat comes from a different source, only a vigilant and cooperative attitude among the American people can safeguard our freedoms from those who wish to destroy us.Clearly, Invasion USA was a success, one which soon led to similar films built around the horrifying threat of nuclear war.  The movie earned more than one million dollars - not too shabby for a film shot in the course of only seven days on a budget of one hundred twenty seven thousand dollars.  Stock footage from World War II makes up some 30% of the film.  Fictional news broadcasts explaining the progress (or, more correctly, lack of progress) in the war leave room for only so much actual human interaction and dialogue - this is perhaps fortunate, as the characters are less than captivating in and of themselves.  Still, there is enough of a personal dimension to the tragedy unleashed on film to really bring Invasion USA's message across to the sympathetic viewer.  It's impossible not to laugh at parts of this movie all these decades later, but there is an eternally valuable message - exaggerated as it may be - here that all freedom-loving men and women would do well to ponder over.",N/A

803336,"This script certainly could use an ambulance!  This movie reminded me of ""Abandoned"" with its meandering script.  The whole gist of the script relied on a chance encounter with a dead girl's ghost in the middle of a country road and an ensuing possession of Halle Berry's body.  How much further off the beaten track can you get?  That sequence of events had NO RELATIONSHIP to what had happened in the film thus far.  It was like ""black fly in your chardonnay"", to borrow from Alanis Morrisette.  So obtuse and obtrusive, it made the rest of the film dismal to watch.  Plus the ending had offensive twists and turns that were unbelievable and disconnected.  I think the best description of this script and direction is Head Cheese.The only reason it gets even TWO STARS is for Berry's performance.

No. 2 is Gambit, a rougher, more Americanized version of Steed, is played by Gareth Hunt.Even though Purdy and Gambit cannot hold a candle to Steed and Emma, the whole thing seems to work, due to the show's more down-to-Earth and darker storylines.

Several friends told me how their sides hurt from laughing so hard after seeing it in the theater, and the folk music subject interested me. After watching the film at home myself, I felt a little disappointed. I chuckled a few times, but overall I didn't find &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; very funny. I understood a lot of the references to the folk music &quot;revival&quot; of the 1950s and 1960s, but either the humor was just too silly or too subtle to tickle my funny bone. The acting is superb, the characters seem genuine and believable, but the plot is dry. Thirty minutes into the movie, I caught myself glancing at the DVD display every few minutes to see how much more time was left--not a good sign. If you like the folk music of the 1950s and 1960s, or are a fan of Christopher Guest, you may enjoy this movie, but if you haven't seen it, I'd recommend renting it before spending over twenty dollars to buy the DVD. It was somewhat amusing the first time through, but it's certainly not a film I'd want to watch again.",N/A

341000,"Caveat - I never studied the case upon which this flick was allegedly based, aside from seeing an entry about it in a copy of ""Ripley's Believe it or not!"", so I can't comment on its accuracy.  However, this flick grabbed me nonetheless.  DB Sweeny is Walton, a starry eyed dreamer in what looks like the woods of wild America.  He suffers a strange relationship with those he considers his friends, so that when he ""disappears"", they are suspected of murder.  Travis's friends are implicated in his disappearance, and begin to wonder whether, despite their certainty in their story, whether they might somehow be guilty for his loss.  Instead, Travis reappears with no concious memory of the lost time.  He undergoes hypnosis and recalls a traumatic sojourn aboard an alien craft.  At this point, the flick is forced to leave the promising plot-line that pitted Travis with his friends with that of whether his illusions are genuine memories (the film presents them so lucidly, it's impossible to believe the film disbelieves them).  ""Fire"" bravely plays up the alien menace of these abducting aliens - eschewing the stereotype of abduction as an enlightening evolution.  Instead of an intergalactic peace corps, these guys look like CIA freelancers.  The interiors of the ship look more like they were inspired by the darkness of the 90's than the bright and optimistic 70's that gave us the abduction craze to begin with.  DB Sweeny and Rob Patrick give effective performances in a story that measures its thin supply of shocks.  Definately watch-worthy.",N/A

Boy was that a crock.The film is mostly - that is, about 98% - boring, slow-moving, and tedious, trying to get some &quot;drama&quot; into it. The plot is ridiculous and filmed and acted in such a way as to make it even more unrealistic, like a bad anime. It's utterly joyless and depressing. The characters you don't much care for.There are a couple of promising-looking swordfights - there seem to be maybe three swordfights in the whole movie - but they're badly filmed and in the end you feel cheated - you don't get to see just how the heroine survives those dozen or so opponents.  The bad costumes make the fights look even more silly. The final showdown ends weakly and cheaply. Very cheaply.So what was all the hype about?I see some of you don't believe me. Fine. Buy it.

I guess that this is a type of ""ironic brilliance"" but in all honesty, that's about the only thing you'll probably find funny with this mess of a movie. While his MTV television show had its share of funny moments back in the day, Tom Green should have left the acting (as well as directing) to people who can actually do it.

Ric Flair 6/10This was a solid opener, nothing too special and nothing too awful. Benjamin is a good young talent and put on a great match here and Flair is past his time and all he knows how to do is chop. Benjamin wins this match at the 8 minute mark with a top rope clothesline.Coach def. Tajiri 4/10This match was better than what I expected but was still not great. Coach can actually wrestle, he really suprised me. Tajiri used some good offence in this match but was beaten by Coach after Garrison Cade interfered.Chris Jericho def. Christian/Trish Stratus 8/10Another exellent match from Jericho and Christian. Trish didn't really do much in this match exept covering Jericho after he was beaten down by Christian. I liked the moves used by both men in this match and they have a great chemistery together. Y2J picked up the win in this match at around the 15 minute mark.Womans Championship-Victoria def. Lita 5/10Womans wrestling has really improved over the years. This was actually a good 6-7 minute match with lots of back and fourth action. Lita is in great shape and Victoria is the best womans wrestler around in my veiw. Victoria retained the title at the 7 minute mark with a small package roll up.Intercontinental Title-Randy Orton def. Mick Foley 9/10WHAT A HARDCORE MATCH. This was the equal match of the night with the triple threat match. Lots of weapons were used by both men and it was a bloody match. Orton got thrown off the stage through a table, thrown into a barb wire board and slammed in thumbtacks while Cactus Jack took loads of bumps and got the RKO on to a barb wire bat(barbie). Randy Orton retained the Intercontinental title at the 21 minute mark with an RKO on the barb wire bat.La Resistance vs. Hurricane/Rosey 2/10Basicly a filler with no build up and no title on the line. I forgot who won it and that shows how good it was.Edge def. Kane 5/10A very average match match which should have been way better. It was only 6 minutes long and didn't get going until the end. Edge is one of my favourite wrestlers and I was happy to see him return but this match wasn't one of his best. Edge completes his comeback at the 6 minute mark with a spear on the monster Kane.WHW Title-Chris Benoit vs. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels 9/10An exellent match between three superstars of wrestling. It was not as good as their match at Wrestlemania 20 but was still a classic encounter. This was a straight out wrestling match and never got dull. I rated this match 9/10 because it wasn't as good as their 10/10 WM classic. Chris Benoit retains in his home town after making Michaels tap to the sharpshooter at around the 30 minute mark.Overall an exellent Raw ppv which scored a 48/80.

310543,"Terrific costuming and production design, most noteworthy is the luminous camerawork of Sven Nykvist (Bergman/Allen/Tarkovsky and others). The film is paced as languidly as narrative film making will permit, allowing a certain quality of the author's voice to be felt beneath the demands of ""storytelling"", one of the chief obstacles in adapting this material.I think that a masterstroke in this film is the music. While it may seem inconsequential, it draws the film into a more complex direction than typical period music would have done. I believe that this allows the film to reinvent the quality of emotional space in the material.Contemporary composers of modern chamber music like Hans Werner Henze (who'd collaborated with Schlondorff before) were brought into the making of the film. The music succeeds by injecting an atonal, dissonant, aching, atmosphere into the story. The piano and violin pieces work well against typical form and aid the narrative in a superbly contemplative manner. I was reminded somewhat of ""L'Ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re &agrave; Marienbad"", simply because the musical ""cues"" were not spelled out in simple terms.Avoiding kitsch is part of the problem when adapting an author who discusses subjects (in epic detail) which have been filmed a thousand times before - in my opinion, the music permits yet another interpretation of that subject. At first its quietly unusual, becoming a defined, twisting voice, accenting the growing dissonance Swann experiences with Odette and ultimately with society.It is a beautiful film. My only concerns were the occasionally odd voice-over work, which was a little distracting. Ornella Muti is a knockout, but her beauty seems oddly contemporary - its as if  the filmmakers were trying to make the statement that voluptuousness is eternal, while beauty standards shift periodically and culturally. Irons is excellent as Swann. I would highly recommend the film.",N/A

Absolutely, because it makes it a funnier story. Who really wants to see a movie about the people next door and their problems?

799178,"**1/2 ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Wachowski Brothers' cultic sci-fi trilogy, whose previous entries were ""The Matrix"" and ""The Matrix Reloaded.""  In the series' final installment, the messiah figure, Neo, does battle with the diabolical forces that have imprisoned most of humanity in a world of cyber unreality via a massive computer program known as The Matrix.Of the three films, ""Revolutions"" is definitely the least imaginative and the least interesting.  What separated the first two episodes in the series from most other action films was the willingness on the part of the filmmakers to bring some thematic depth and narrative complexity to a genre that, all too often, finds no room for such qualities.  The previous two films didn't always succeed in their endeavor - often emerging as more hollow and pretentious than meaningful and profound - but they managed to remain intriguing even in their moments of failure.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for ""Revolutions,"" which spends so much time on repetitive action scenes and special effects that there is little time left over for storyline and theme.  In a strange way, Neo himself ends up getting lost in this film, dropping off the radar screen for astonishingly long stretches of time, only to re-emerge periodically to remind us that there really is supposed to be a purpose buried somewhere beneath all this ear-splitting commotion (this could be re-titled ""Finding Neo"").  The sad fact, though, is that, once we arrive at the climactic scene to which all three films have been building, the resolution turns out to be a ham-handed muddle, utterly lacking in clarity and coherence  After an almost six-hour-long buildup over the course of the three films, the audience is left scratching its collective head wondering just what it was that happened before the closing credits started rolling by.  Perhaps smarter people than I can figure all this out for, frankly, after the overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter.It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from ""Revolutions"" - which we did from the two previous ""Matrix"" films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which ""Revolutions"" very nearly is.  Even the stolid earnestness of Keanu Reeves can't convince us this time around that there is anything hidden under all those cool gadgets and explosions worth our looking into.Thus endeth the Matrix series, not with a bang but with a whimper - intellectually speaking that is.",N/A

851440,"Antoine Fuqua's ""King Arthur"" manages to suck all of the magic, valor, and mystery out of the much-loved Arthurian legends.  What is left is a dull, dreary, generic action flick in which King Arthur's noble Knights of the Round Table curse, drink, crack crude jokes, and sex-it up.  Being that ""King Arthur"" has touted itself as ""the untold true story that inspired the legend"", I was left with the impression that King Arthur's knights were crude, dirty bums that sat around all day; drinking and complaining.  Merlin makes an appearance too as part of a face-painted tribe of barbarians living in the woods.  Can you feel the magic here, folks?This ""true story"" is bogged down with stilted speeches about how every man is born free and equal and frantic, confusing battle sequences.  And the script?  Here's a sampling of some of the cinematic masterpieces that await you:Lancelot: There is a large number of lonely men out there.Guinevere: Don't worry; I won't let them rape you.Arthur: O merciful God, I have such need of Your mercy now...Lancelot: Why do you always talk to God and not to me?Gawain: The gifts the gods gave me I use in battle or in bed.Galahad: Imagine what a lovely, quiet place the world would be if everyone had their throats slit.Horton: God help us. What are they?Bors: Blue demons that eat Christians alive. You're not a Christian, are you?The acting just don't cut it either.  From previous experience, I realized that Clive Owen's King Arthur and Keira Knightley's Guinevere (who is now a painted pagan prison inhabitant) are supposed to be falling in love, but it is never apparent to the audience until they, predictably, jump in bed together.  And the famous love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lacelot?  Practically nonexistent.",King Arthur
600794,"This sequel to the 1999 original Stuart Little movie is every bit as good as that one and in some ways I would go as to say that it's even better.The legendary mouse Stuart Little goes on an another adventure when after returning to a normal life with his human family, The Littles, Stuart finds himself developing a crush on a canary but she is in danger of being imprisoned by a tyrant falcon who hates mice and the female bird has never gotten a chance to migrate south with the rest of her species. She and Stuart's worlds collide one day and they've sparked a romance but after she is kidnapped by the evil falcon, Stuart Little and his former feline rival and now somewhat friend Snowbell work together and set out to find and rescue her from the evil falcon before it's too late.This film is yet another good sequel in moviemaking that dodges the infamous sequel-slump and brilliantly continues the story from the first Stuart Little movie. The mix of live and computer animation is really excellent and even the canary and Stuart Little look almost realistic and perfectly blend in with the live footage.

472777,"Every fan of movies should be forced to watch Caligula as an ascetic exercise at least once.  For only in discovering how bad cinema can be are we able to fully appreciate how good it can be.  And the good news is that the film has a message- absolute power corrupts absolutely!  That is the end of the good news.As an historical drama, Caligula completely fails to capture any sense of time and place.  While some of the scenes depicted (such as the Emperor Tiberius swimming with his ""little fishes"") are based on historical sources, it seems as though it could have taken place on Mars.  The sets and costumes are incredibly garish or silly, sacrificing any suspension of disbelief.  The camera work is amateurish- it zips around, losing its subject, and often delivering an unclear picture due to what seems to be inadequate lighting or a failure to focus on the subject.  The picture is grainy throughout and tough on the eyes.As an ""artistic"" hard core porno flick, Caligula is boring and not the slightest bit titillating.  The sexuality is displayed between frequent and extremely gruesome acts of violence (the multitude of which I will not catalogue here, suffice it to say the movie should not be watched while eating).  Also, when trying to advance the plot (if Caligula has one), the hard core scenes are exasperating in their ability to delay the progression and break down whatever narrative quality the film might have had.Other reviews speak adequately as to the story of how this train wreck of a movie occurred, so I won't go into it.  I can suggest, however, that you will likely never see such an A-list cast in such an awful movie ever again.  The included documentary is laughable- Guccione is really convinced he is making a truly important film, and the casting reflects that.Now, the only dramatic alternative I know of to Caligula that covers the same period is ""I, Claudius"".  While Claudius runs 668 minutes and Caligula runs 155, I can guarantee you that the latter seems to go on much longer; forever, in fact.  You emerge from viewing it wondering what in the world you just watched, and whether or not viewing a film can actually make you a less noble person.

Originally intended for a UK audience, the Maysles brothers' documentary follows the Beatles from the very moment they landed at JFK airport until they departed for home some two weeks later. Included are highlights from the Beatles' performances on the Ed Sullivan Show as well as portions of their first American concert at the Washington Coliseum. Behind the scenes footage from the hotel rooms, the Peppermint Lounge (for a night on the town), press photo shoots, and on the train to (and from) Washington, D.C. give an idea of how amazingly close the Maysles brothers were to the center of it all. Their landmark style of creating documentaries provides an amazing ""fly on the wall"" perspective.  There is no narration and there are no formal interviews.  The film lets the event speak for itself as it captures the action quite naturally and spontaneously.  Nothing is staged and the film provides a most intimate look at the Beatles' interaction with each other as well as with the excitement of Beatlemania.  For those of us born too late to witness and experience the mania, this is our link to the past and a glimpse at the beginning of a very important revolution in pop music and culture.The re-release of this noteworthy documentary provides a noticeable improvement over the original version.  There is now an audio commentary by Albert Maysles.  Furthermore, there is a 51-minute interview with him which includes his presentation of a handful of outtakes from the original film.  One notable highlight of the personal interview includes Maysles' discussion of how his camera was accidentally turned on at the Washington Coliseum concert.  Without a second thought, he propped it up on his shoulder (without security seeing him).  His brief footage provides a very rare view of how a Beatle fan saw and ""heard"" the Beatles play.  It's very clear from the footage that fans interested in listening to the show simply could not do so.  Other intriguing highlights include recorded comments from teenagers and adults on the street and at JFK airport.The drawbacks to be noted about this DVD are the result of other previous DVD releases including the Ed Sullivan Presents the Beatles DVD set and The Beatles Anthology.  The Sullivan set contains ALL of the shows in their entirety while this release only includes portions of shows.  The Anthology set contains a good segment of the Coliseum concert taken from an absolutely pristine film print and not the more common well-worn copy.  This release still contains the worn footage.  It would have been nice to see a bonus feature containing the complete Coliseum concert from the master print.  However, this DVD is the original documentary and the integrity is maintained throughout.  It's important to note that the Maysles brothers did not have permission to film in either the CBS studios for the Sullivan shows or in the Washington Coliseum. (One other highlight on the extra footage is Paul McCartney trying to come to the brothers' aid when security blocked them from the CBS studio for the first show.)  A color booklet is included with a handful of photos and quotes from each of the Beatles; however, perhaps Apple could have designed a better booklet to include reprints of news articles and reviews from 1964, transcripts of Beatle interviews, and, perhaps, a reprint of the diary of events from Mark Lewishon's Beatles Chronicle.This is definitely a treat for Beatle fans and a great example of how to produce a quality documentary.  I also recommend the Maysles brothers' production, Gimme Shelter, where they capture the exciting and controversial events surrounding the Rolling Stones 1969 tour, including the tragedy at Altamont.",The Beatles - The First U.S. Visit VHS

202740,"When watching the cheesy horror movies of the 50s and 60s some may think that monster movies were always made that way.  Not so, as you can see in this classic horror film.  While there had been a number of silent movies made in the horror genre, and Dracula had already set the standard for vampire movies and Frankenstein had set the standard for monster movies, movies about beasts among the talkies were still a bit thin.Lon Chaney managed to set a standard for creature films.  Dracula was not a sympathetic character.  He was cold and self-serving, and his morality apparently non-existent.  He lived only to master others.  Dr. Frankenstein was also not a sympathetic character.  He robbed graves and attempted to play God.  His monster, on the other hand, had some moments where we felt sympathetic, but we were relieved when he was killed, which happened often in the numerous movies in which he appeared in the 30s.  The Wolf Man, on the other hand, has always been a victim of circumstances.  Often, or even perhaps typically, a nice guy who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  In the case of Lon Chaney's Wolf Man, he was helping someone when he was bitten.Bela Lugosi plays Bela, a bit of original name creation if there ever was one, who also happens to be a werewolf.  Lugosi's part in this film is short, providing some background appearances and a small handful of lines before succumbing to Lon Chaney's silver-handled cane.  While his presence is brief, it is ominous.Maria Ouspenskaya is another standard setter as the stereotypical ""old Gypsy"" Maleva who tells fortunes that lead to people becoming werewolves or dying.  She gets to utter the poem that explains even nice people can become wolves when the wolf bane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.  Though there is no mention of a full moon, the implication is that the moon must be pretty close to full.  I also found the reference to autumn unusual, as later werewolf movies generally allowed the werewolf to transform during any time of year.The makeup transitions are marvelous.  We only see Lon Chaney's legs for most of the transition to a werewolf, and the transition seems to take forever; actually its only seconds but who wants to look at a Lon Chaney's legs that long?  The transition back to human from a werewolf is much better as we get to see Chaney's face throughout.These early horror movies were well done because they leveraged minimal special effects with a spooky atmosphere and chiller music as opposed to lots of entrails and blood.  Or course, in the early 30s color films had yet to be produced commercially so blood often had to be identified in the dialogue in any case.  Everything about this movie from the music to the foggy moor and the ominous Gypsy woman all contribute to the air of doom surrounding the story, ultimately focusing on Lon Chaney.Also watch for Claude Rains playing Lon Chaney's father, though the two are physically very different people, and a very young Ralph Bellamy whose presence is generally kept to standing in pensive poses with a pipe in his mouth.Horror movies about creatures have a long history, and this movie is one of the best.  The Wolf Man series continued to deteriorate over a lengthy period until reinvigorated by more recent movies such as ""An American Werewolf in London"" and ""Wolf"" with Jack Nicholson.  However, the central character in each of these owes a debt to the portrayal of Lon Chaney.",N/A

706463,"At this stage of the series I have to acknowledge that I am totally hooked. After finishing the third disc, I could not wait to watch the next one. In the episodes contained in this installment we see some of the main characters examine their motivations for participating in Griffith's quest. Especially Guts, who will have trouble finding a reason to keep going after what happens in the first episode in the disc (Noble Man).When Griffith, the leader of the Band of Hawks, discovered that Yuruis was the mastermind behind his assassination attempt, he decided to send Guts to kill the king's brother. Guts mission was supposed to be carried out with secrecy, but things did not go as flawlessly as planned. As a result, Guts becomes considerably distraught by the events that developed during his mission, and to make matters worse he overhears a conversation between Griffith and the princess that adds more doubts to his mind. From this point on, Guts is chased in dreams by memories of his childhood with Gambino and by Zodd the Immortal, the monster he faced previously.Also, Caska finds herself having trouble coping with the relationship that is developing between Griffith and Princess Charlotte. Griffith is rising in court and the political games continue, but his attention focuses on the war and the princess. As a result of this, Caska opens up a little in his attitude towards Guts, and shares some astonishing revelations about Griffith's past!What I found most satisfying in this set of episodes was the profound view we get of the emotions and thoughts of the characters. Although I enjoy the action packed episodes, and the ones here have their fare share, I was marveled by the deeper aspects of the story. At this point I can say without fear of making a mistake that this series is truly amazing.",N/A

764376,"Christopher Guest first came to prominence in 1984, as an assistant and star in Rob Reiner's hilarious &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;.Guest learned at the hands of the master, and the last 20 years of his career have been spent on mockumentary efforts (""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"", and, in 2002, ""A Mighty Wind"", where he decided to satirize the 60's folk music movement, something he and his fellow Spinal-Tappers had once done as a skit on Saturday Night Live).  There are hallmarks in Guest's work.  He utilizes a co-writer, the newly popular Eugene Levy (the best part of Steve Martin's recent ""Bringing Down the House""), he has a regular cast of character actors that ad-lib their way through zany and satirical situations in all three films, and he conquers the art form of teasing fans and popular culture icons with gentle spoofing, double entendres, hidden meanings, and really great filmmaking.Although I enjoyed the film in the theater, it really came into its own when I was able to watch the DVD where I could marvel at the details and depths of Guest and Levy's imagination, and the brilliance of their comedy.  It's strewn throughout the film, but a lot is captured and hightlighed in the DVD's special features.The premise of the film is simple:Irving Steinbloom, aged icon of the 50's and 60's folk music scene, has died in New York.  His son, who followed him in managing folk music acts, Jonathon (Bob Balaban)endeavors to create a ""PBN"" concert in his dad's memory, bringing together three of dad's oldest and most famous acts.  We get to see the faded stars in their lives today, deciding to do the show, then practicing, traveling to the Big Apple and enduring some mild hoopla and memories.  Finally, we see the big event.It was easy to pick out the most outstanding performance of the film, it belonged to co-writer Levy (as Mitch), who completely convinces you, iron gray wig and all, that he is an unhinged,  deer-in-the-headlights folk icon, with much of his early musical promise deadened by the cornucopia of meds he's taken over the last three decades, to try to capture some mental stability.  To fully appreciate his performance, and the droll wit that drives Levy, see his ad-lib in the Special Features press conference, where Mitch does a completely credible and incredible speech, comparing Rap music to folk music.  You gotta see it to believe it!Strolling through the DVD also brought out the idiosyncrasies in the film and let me marvel at the comedic turns of the delightful Jennifer Coolidge (as Amber Cole, eastern European escapee and PR agent) and John Michael Higgins (as Terry Bohner. Leader of the ""New Main Street Singers"").  Both were completely over the top in ""Best of Show"", and even more laughable here.  Both are amazing scene stealers, but you have to think back over the scene to realize it.In the Special Features, you're really crushed to find deleted scenes that should have survived the film's editing (particularly Coolidge in a deadpan ""piccolo"" joke), memorable songs (""The Good Book"", by the New Main Street Singers, is hilarious) and the unmatched wry and acerbic humor of commentators Guest and Levy.  Guest, with amazing attention to detail, even filmed the concert portion of ""A Mighty Wind"" with TV cameras to be able to recreate the concert as it might have appeared on PBS or public access.""AMW"" is not for everyone.  Those who won't want to probe for the humor or the double entendre or can't reminisce about the golden age and the innocence of folk music will probably think it dull, dull, dull.  I've rated it four stars, because it pales in comparison to Guffman and Best in Show, but I must say, I really enjoyed the film.Guest is a genius at understated, satirical comedy and at making gentle, loving jibes at pop culture stereotypes.  Although ""AMW"" may be the lesser of his three films, it still proves that he is truly the king of film comedy.  Can't wait for his next one!",N/A

It sincerely adds to a watcher's viewing pleasure.The quality of each DVD is remarkable; with stunning clarity and audio.

Ginter (""Rock and a Hard Place""/PEARL HARBOR, S.W.A.T.) and - last but not least - the late-great  Kevin Smith who played Ares, God of War, in both HERCULES - in this season for the first time - and XENA, WARRIOR PRINCESS. It was especially touching, while Kevin Sorbo and Wayne Rose were doing their audio commentary for ""Encounter"", that they acknowledged Kevin Smith and how much he is missed.By the way, we also get to see some other familiar faces, including Alexandra Tydings (Aphrodite), the ever popular Bruce Campbell (Autolycus), Lucy Lawless (Xena) and Renee O'Connor (Gabrielle) again!Included in the set I purchased was an extra special CD-Rom disc with chronicles, trivia, bios and mythology.

His performance is terrific, as usual.  The show is ""greatest hits"" set, but with so many hits over the years, there's so much uncovered and this release will only leave a fan wanting more.This is an interesting release, presenting both the TV version and un-cut ""portions"" of the show (presented in its original full screen aspect ratio and with an option for 5.1 sound that mostly just brings in surrounding crowd noise).  It's fascinating to see all the in-between instructions and chatter (turn up your volume high to hear Barry given an inspirational ""break a leg"" [not in those exact words] and Barry's response right before the show begins).I only find it odd that the supplied Concert List on the DVD indicates that even more songs were performed that night.  Was it already decided not to tape those songs?  If they were taped, then this un-cut version isn't really complete.  It's also nice hearing Barry talk on the commentary, but for a 2-disc set, I expected more, though the price is very good.I recommend this, and what Manilow fan will hesitate to buy, but I just hope someone really puts together a retrospective DVD set of the performer (TV special bits, promotional videos, concert clips, documentary footage).

The second reason was because you just did not get a chance to know the characters.  They all had very brief introductions.  You never knew who Cruise worked for or who worked for him. Foxx's character had the most involvement of the major characters. Yet you barely knew him.  they should have used more time to get you involved with each of the character's lives.

791669,"This is one of the hardest reviews I have written,because I really don't comprehend why Matchstick Men made me feel the way it did.The plot was simple,the movie was simple (especially for someone like Scott) and the story twists were not incredibly surprising.But the movie made me think about it for days after I saw it,and that is usually a good sign.This is the story of Roy (Cage),a con man with an obsessive compulsive disorder and many other problems.He has been divorced for more than ten years and does not have anyone but his younger partner in crime Frank (Rockwell).However,it is when he find out about his 14 year old daughter,whom he did not even know existed,that things start to get both better and complicated for Roy.Let me begin by saying that I fell in love from the start with Cage's portrayal of Roy.This was the best I have seen him in years.He makes you really feel sympathy for Roy,care about him and believe in him.Alison Lohman was ok too,though I find her a bit disturbing,I don't know why.Rockwell had limited screen time,but made me wish for more.Ridley Scott's directing was felt all the time,made every frame of the movie a picture you can hang on your wall.The color and light usage impressed me especially.For me,matchstick men was going fine until the last quarter,where I'm not sure things went exactly the way I was hoping they would.The cons were not extremely incredible or complicated,the story did not have huge ups and downs and I sat down and enjoyed Cage's performance. Although the ending was satisfactory logically,there was a hollow feeling in my stomach which I can not get rid of whenever I think about this film.The story twist that almost everybody mentioned, is not so unpredictable,but it is better not to try predicting anything if you want to enjoy the movie.If not for anything,the movie is worth seen for the acting and directing,although I'm not sure many people would want to see this movie twice.I give it 5 stars for very subjective reasons,and I will definitely watch it many more times,but you may want to catch this one on tv.",N/A

122567,"It seems almost redundant to talk about how amazing a film Sergio Leone's masterpiece, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is. So much has already been said about it by the many filmmakers, scholars, and film lovers whom it affected deeply. The film transcends the negative `Spaghetti Western' label so hastily slapped on the many Euro-Westerns that appeared in the late 1960. Yes, many of these movies were trashy and low-quality, but there were also many great films, and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" reigns supreme amongst them. In it, Leone, who had previously helmed the ""Dollars"" trilogy with Clint Eastwood, achieves a sublime level of mythic poetry, reaching into the realms of the Western as fantasy fairy-tale. He touches on the themes of almost all Westerns that came before it, references many classic American Westerns, and crafts it all into a tale of the men and women who built the open West and who then watched its demise under the new forces of civilization. Leone's film is almost choreographed, like a dance of death between the four fascinating main characters: Jill, prostitute-turned-homemaker (Claudia Cardinale); Frank, the ruthless killer hired by the railroads `to remove small objects from the track' (Henry Fonda, in the surprise role of his career); Cheyenne, the rough and comic outlaw (Jason Robards); and the mysterious, implacable gunman known to everyone only as `Harmonica,' (Charles Bronson) who's lonesome wail on the instrument is the eerie signature sound of the film. The lives of these four collide in the Arizona desert (filmed alternately in Spain and Monument Valley, Utah), against the backdrop of the arrival of the railroad, and slowly work out their destinies in the dying West.This DVD was a long time coming. MGM quickly released the three Leone-Eastwood films to DVD, but Paramount took its time getting around to the director's greatest work. However, the special edition was worth the wait. The two-disc set is loaded with fantastic extras. The transfer in widescreen is glorious (and to think for years we had to watch it cropped for TV!), the new 5.1 sound mix showcases Leone's brilliant use of sound effects and propels Ennio Morricone's legendary score to the operatic height it deserves. The audio commentary track splits between numerous individuals. Much of the talking is done by Leone experts Sir Christopher Frayling and Dr. Sheldon Hall. Their comments sometimes fall into play-by-play, over-explaining the actions on the screen, but they do provide many fascinating facts about the making of the movie (filming locations, set design, the actors), mentions of the many other Westerns that the film quotes, and observations on Sergio Leone's unique style. There are also brief interruptions from directors who are Leone fans or who knew him personally, such as John Milius, John Carpenter, Alex Cox, and Bernardo Bertolucci (who wrote the screen story of the film along with Dario Argento). All have interesting stories to tell (Carpenter is pretty funny, since he admits he hasn't seen the film in a while, and is quite amused by what he sees). Cardinale pops in very briefly to talk about the love scene between her and Henry Fonda.The second disc contains a lengthy documentary, which goes into great depth on the making of the film. All the speakers from the commentary take part in the interviews, and they are joined by actor Gabriele Ferzetti (who plays Mr. Morton in the film), composer Ennio Morricone, and archival interviews with Henry Fonda and Sergio Leone himself. The only problem with the documentary is the artificial separation of it into three sections. Another documentary provides historical background on the coming of the railroad, and adds extra perspective on the film's story. There's also a feature that allows you to compare the filming locations in Monument Valley to what they look like today, the original U.S. trailer, and a stills gallery. All around, great bonus material for a film that deserves them.For those of you who have never seen ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" I envy your first experience with it. It moves slowly, deliberately, with time and suspense stretched out and distended to their limits, but even if you think you have a short attention span, it's impossible not to fall under Leone's spell of Western ritual, close-ups, wide-spanning landscape shots, sudden explosions of violence, and his ability to inject doses of mythic wonder into every single shot. And if you've already a fan of this film, this DVD set is a dream come true. Buy it, invite all your friends over, and introduce them to the best Euro-Western ever produced.",N/A

619160,"***1/2 One of the marks of a truly great performer is the ability to appear alone on screen for long periods of time - without the aid of other actors or even dialogue - and still create a fully-rounded, easily recognizable character, using nothing more than gestures, body language and facial expressions.  Charlotte Rampling achieves just that sort of magic in ""Swimming Pool,"" an odd little psychological thriller that makes ""Adaptation"" look like a model of clarity, coherence and comprehensibility in comparison.  For the first twenty minutes or so, Rampling has the screen virtually all to herself and she definitely makes the most of the occasion.  She plays Sarah Morton, a successful author of murder mysteries who's become bored with the restraints of her genre and now feels the need to branch out and try her hand at different and more rewarding types of writing.  When her publisher offers her his villa in France as a place to get away and do some writing, Sarah jumps at the opportunity.  Unfortunately, after only a few days there, Sarah finds her peace and solitude shattered by the unexpected arrival of her publisher's nymphomaniac daughter, Julie.  Although there is initially a great deal of tension between the two women, a bizarre symbiotic relationship eventually develops, with Sarah secretly using Julie as the subject for her newest book and Julie feeding Sarah's morbid fantasies, first unconsciously, then consciously.For about two thirds of the film, writer/director Francois Ozon presents us with the classic - one might almost say stereotypical - conflict between a moralistic, sexually repressed, almost ""frigid"" British woman and a beautiful, uninhibited and sensual Continental nymphet.  But, as the story progresses, a certain personality transference begins to take place, with Sarah taking on some of the traits of the girl she professes to despise and Julie finding a way to ""help"" Sarah complete her novel.  I can't say that I completely understand the last half hour or so of the film, although I do suspect that the answer lies somewhere along the line of last year's ""Adaptation,"" which also dealt with the art of writing and the strange blending of the real and the surreal, of truth and fantasy that often accompanies the act.  Suffice it to say that you will either go with the film all the way to the end or tune out at about the 70-minute point.In addition to Rampling's amazing performance as the uptight middle-aged woman (one recalls, with a certain wistful amusement, that, in 1966's ""Georgy Girl,"" it was SHE who played the promiscuous femme fatale), the film offers us the beautiful and talented Ludivine Sagnier as Julie, a street smart kid who knows how to exploit her sex appeal for all its worth yet who occasionally displays moments of childlike tenderness and vulnerability beneath the hardened surface.You may end up scratching your head at the end of ""Swimming Pool,"" but I guarantee it will get you thinking.",Swimming Pool

575778,"I had worked previously with Steve Murray's Reiki healing video and found it to be marvelously effective with significant results in the form of relief from much of the persistant pain from my fibromyalgia. Convinced by the efficacy of Reiki from Steve's presentation and my own past experiences with in-person Reiki practitioners, I decided to purchase this DVD, as there was no one in my area who was qualified to train me in Reiki I and II.Why does it work? Well...from a metaphysical point of view, all spaces are HERE and all time is NOW--there's no reason you and Steve can't connect in the HERE AND NOW. The crystal in the video is merely a focal point to keep the mind and attention centered...and yes, it is not uncommon to see quite a bit of phenomena on screen; for some viewers the crystal may change color, become cloudy or clearer, see moving images, etc. I know I saw it change. But that's beside the point--it's just a bridge to help you and Steve connect...and you will.I felt a strong rush of heat during the Attunement, and at one point felt a powerful rise of emotion, rather like a barrier breaking down, causing a few tears to slip down my face, followed by a great sense of calm and resolution, as if something half healed in me was finally made whole.And yes--after the Attunement there was no question that the Reiki energy flowed effortlessly from both hands, rather like a gentle current of strong warmth. (After my Reiki II Attunement, it it became greatly intensified once I began using the Usui Reiki symbols, more like a deep pulsing sensation that tends to linger for hours after I give Reiki).I also recommend Steve's new book on Reiki, which will answer a lot of your questions, and Steve also recommends to continue seeking out information, resources and discovering new ways to channel this beneficial healing energy.Reiki works.

477444,"I have not seen another movie by this director-so I can not compare this DVD to his documentaries-but this movie is a small, heartbreaking, and hard to forget exploitation film.  The seductive cinematography allow us to see the Prague through the (mostly) sympathetic eyes of a 16 year old hustler (Merek) who happens to be gay (he seems to be one of the few male prostitutes in this film who is).  The travelogue-style opening shots of Czechoslovakia suck us in to the bleak nihilistic underbelly of post communist Czechoslovakian society populated by people who dwell on the fringe, surviving any way they can from one day to the next.  Apparently, when the fog of communism lifted from this part of the Eastern Block, fascism replaced it with its trademark culture of violence-in a post AIDS world.  But this becomes incidental.This motion picture is more like The Passion of Christ than My Own Private Idaho.  However, unlike Mel Gibson, this director mercifully spares us from many of the details of the violence inflicted, but the effects of that violence stay with us.  Intense, unflinching and gritty-at times difficult to watch, like an automobile accident in slow motion-the combined homoerotic and homophobic content (the inherent contradiction in this type of filmmaking) exploits the eroticism it condemns.  Not one of the cardboard characters who impacts Merek's downward spiral has many (or any) redeemable qualities-most are manipulative, self-centered and cruel.  Merek's youthful good looks and unsinkable innocence keep us watching, while his father's search for his prodigal son gives us hope.  One wonders why a filmmaker would become obsessed with the world of young male hustlers and wicked male predators.  Is this one self-loathing homosexual's effort to paint a picture of modern Babylon through an exploration of his own desires?  Or greed?  (Or both?)

320802,"LIMELIGHT must serve as the ultimate ""love it or hate it"" film.  If you fit into the ""hate it"" category, then you'll find this a silly, self-serving, self-indulgent, over-long piece of megalomania.  You may think of it as overly sentimental and possibly emotionally manipulative, with Chaplin pitying himself at every turn and pitching all his neuroses onto the big screen.  On the other hand, I absolutely adore it.  Sure, it's melodrama, but it's the purest and best form of melodrama.  It comes straight from Chaplin's heart and the autobiographical feel gives the sad moments just that much more of a kick.Set in London in 1914, the story and its characters are very simple.  An old music hall clown at the end of his career turns to alcoholism and a young ballerina loses her confidence and attempts suicide.  If that sounds depressing, you're right; and that's only the film's opening sequence.  The movie isn't an out and out downer though; it has its emotional highs and lows as the pair pursues the only thing that brings meaning to their lives -- the stage.  It's interesting to note that during the dream sequence where Calvero (Chaplin) performs alone, the audience disappears; when his dream places Terry (Claire Bloom) alongside him, the applause echoes.  And, of course, without Calvero to encourage her, the ballerina cannot perform.Odd to say this about a Chaplin film, but the dialog is marvelous.  It shouts out to be quoted, with Chaplin's character opining on everything up to and including the meaning of life.  Sure, it isn't realistic, but the speeches are great and fit in with the movie's bombastic attitude.It's the relationship between the young ballerina and the old clown that brings me back to this film.  The documentary touches on this briefly and raises the right questions.  Are they in love?  Can they be?  Are they fooling themselves as well as each other?  They both clearly need each other, but how self-destructive is the relationship?  Calvero tries to teach Terry to be optimistic while standing on the cliff of depression himself and Terry praises Calvero's abilities while unable to come to terms with her own.  The questions and contradictions make for a very thought-provoking experience.Much has been made about Buster Keaton's extended cameo near the film's conclusion.  I've read that during the filming Keaton was much funnier in their comedy scene together and Chaplin (being director) edited the result in such a way as to throw the spotlight back on himself.  I've also read denials that this ever happened, and I've even read that even if this were true, it makes sense in the context of how the film is progressing (Calvero being upstaged at this moment would have wrecked the whole point of the scene).  I honestly don't know what's true, but Keaton's presence is more than welcome, serving as a grumpy counterpoint, anchoring the film before it floats away in schmaltz.  It seems oddly fitting that he is present in the background as a witness to Calvero/Chaplin's farewell.The DVD extras work well, with a whole second disc devoted purely to features.  The ""Chaplin Today"" mini-documentaries have been the highlights of these Chaplin DVDs and the one on here continues that tradition, a nice balance being struck between contemporary analysis and interviews with the surviving cast.  In addition, included is all that exists of a short film from 1919 in which Chaplin plays the headman in a flea circus, a gag which he would eventually use in LIMELIGHT.The film's Oscar winning soundtrack is also available on the second disc, though one can only select tracks and cannot rewind or fast forward through individual selections.  Also included are two homemade movies from the Chaplin estate, the first being the family running around enjoying themselves in the US in 1950, while the second documents Chaplin returning to his childhood London neighborhood in 1959.  They're about as dull as one would expect watching someone's vacation films to be.  The selections are silent (the only noise is the gentle whirring of the projector) and the second piece could really have used some narration to explain what we are looking at.LIMELIGHT works on so many different levels.  It's the story of two fictional characters.  But it's also the story of the end of the music halls.  And it's also clearly autobiographical, with Chaplin sensing the end of his career and his life.  And, ultimately, it's a comment on humanity, the old fading away and their place being taken by the young.  It's a bittersweet movie, with even the final tragedy somehow giving us hope for the future.  An excellent film if you allow yourself to become caught up in it.",N/A

615656,"I guess it was inevitable: now that Alfonso Cuaron's adaptation of ""Prisoner"" is finally out, diehard Harry Potter fans are attacking the film. They're complaning about all the stuff that got left out. (No Quidditch final! No Sneakoscope!) They're grousing about how different Hogwarts castle and grounds look, and how drab the colors are, and how the Dementors aren't supposed to fly, and, and, and...Lighten up, people!""Prisoner"" is definitely the best HP film so far. Cuaron knows that this is where the series really takes a darker, more mature turn, and directs accordingly. I loved his use of atmospheric tension and cool scenery. In every film, Hogwarts seems to have evolved into a different edifice; much of the action here takes place in a part of the castle we haven't seen before: a courtyard with a fountain, steep steps leading to a circle of standing stones and then to Hagrid's cabin, a massive iron clock with a pendulum that swings back and forth before the entryway...this stuff is GOOD!The special effects are all superb. The Dementors, drifting around in their torn robes (or is that skin?) and sucking the life out of everything in sight, are creepy as heck. Buckbeak the hippogriff is gorgeous, and the scene where Harry rides him across the lake is one to cheer at. The inflation of Aunt Marge and the Knight Bus are hilarious, the brief Quiddith scene is gripping, and ""Prisoner"" may be the first-ever movie to take a scientific view of what a werewolf would look like (something half-human, half-wolf has gotta be unnatural, and also kind of sad). The Whomping Willow has also evolved; in addition to the big pounding limbs from ""Chamber of Secrets,"" it now has several thin, whippy branches that it uses to knock people off their feet. Hey, I liked it. And the time-travel sequence, with its subliminal ticking clock on the soundtrack, was -- in Ron's words -- brilliant.The acting hits all the right notes. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all matured quite a bit, in their acting as well as their bodies. Radcliffe has presence on screen; the scene where he learns that Sirius Black was his parents' friend who betrayed them to Voldemort has real pathos. All the old adult actors do their shtick again, and we've got plenty of new faces as well. David Thewlis projects weary kindness as Lupin, Emma Thompson is wonderfully spacey as Trelawny, Gary Oldman balances calmness and dementia as Black, Michael Gambon does a nice job showing us that, in the books, Dumbledore is actually a little unhinged, Pam Ferris makes a perfectly detestable Aunt Marge, and Timothy Spall plays Peter ""Wormtail"" Pettigrew as if he really was part rat. Props all around!Okay, the film wasn't perfect. I missed the Quidditch and thought that Crookshanks the cat got ripped off (featured prominently in the book; hardly there in the movie). I was annoyed that they didn't really explain the relationship between Lupin, Black, Pettigrew, and Harry's father, and what they did for each other. Without that context, the apperance of the silver stag at the climax makes no sense to anyone who hasn't read the books. I missed Sir Cadogen, the mad knight, although I loved what they did with the moving paintings otherwise (watch for the giraffe). And, as always, I wish the movie could have lingered a bit more instead of marching doggedly from important plot point to important plot point. ""Prisoner"" is actually shorter than the first two films, even though the book's longer....would it have killed them to take the extra three minutes to explain who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were?Apart from these minor qualms, I really loved ""Prisoner."" But I don't think anyone should let themselves be influenced by the pro-movie and anti-movie camps.

276865,"I first saw Dan Curtis's creepy haunted house story back in 1976, in a movie theater when I was a kid, and both the chauffeur and the end scene haunted me for the longest time afterward.  VERY chilling.The Rolf family -- mother Marion (Karen Black), father Ben (Oliver Reed), son David (Lee H. Montgomery), and lively-as-heck 75-year-old Aunt Elizabeth (Bette Davis) -- decide to leave the city behind for a peaceful, quiet summer in the country (HAH! Not in a Dan Curtis film!).  Marion and Ben find a wonderful, rundown old mansion owned by the Allardyces -- brother Arnold (Burgess Meredith) and his sister Roz (Eileen Heckart).  You can tell from word one that the Allardyce siblings are not playing with a full deck, and that something VERY creepy is going on with this house, but of course the unsuspecting Rolfs don't notice -- especially when they find out they can rent the place for $900 ... not per month, but for the WHOLE SUMMER!  Ben is still skeptical, especially when they learn the deal comes with taking care of the Allardyce's 85-year-old mother, who has the attic room but is never seen (well, ALMOST never).  Marion, however, falls in love with the rambling old mansion, talking Ben into taking it, and swearing the old woman upstairs will be entirely her responsibility.The family moves in, but right away weirdness ensues: Ben starts dreaming a nightmare he hasn't had since his childhood, about his mother's funeral, a nightmare that includes maybe the creepiest chauffeur ever seen; the vibrant Aunt Elizabeth starts to get weak, wanting to sleep all the time, as if the very life force is slowly being drained from her body; Marion becomes obsessed with the house, cleaning and taking care of it, and with the old lady upstairs -- even Marion's manner, speech, and style of dress and hair change; Ben, in the middle of playing with David in the pool, suddenly tries to drown the boy -- and tells Marion later that he meant to drown him, for a moment lost control of himself and was trying to kill him.The weirdness escalates to the conclusion, which is not entirely surprising but very satisfying.  Anyone who sees this film and knows Dan &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; Curtis's style will not be disappointed; the movie is atmospheric, well-acted, and has moments that genuinely get under your skin.  The ending is a little hokey, but again -- if you know Dan Curtis's style -- it's also perfectly acceptable.For new viewers who are more accustomed to what horror movies have become in the last 20 years or so, this movie may be a real bore; it plays more with the mind than with the eyes, and blood, gore, and special effects are kept to a minimum or are non-existent.  And that is exactly what makes it a good film; it relies on the viewer to insert his own creepiness via the &quot;gauzy&quot; visual look of the film, the performances (especially by Black, Davis, and Reed), and by watching these &quot;burnt offerings&quot; (a practice in some cultures of burning animals alive as sacrifices to the Gods) being lined up, unknowingly, for a house rooted in evil.What I don't understand are the complaints about the DVD quality -- mine is find.  Granted, I am more about the picture quality than the sound, but I had no problem hearing the dialogue throughout the film, and the music was never too loud or a distraction.  The picture quality was EXACTLY how it looked when I saw it on the movie theater screen 28 years ago -- that gauzy-white &quot;burned&quot; bright sort of look (burned - &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;? Hmmm) is indeed how the film is SUPPOSED to look!  So I don't know if I got lucky, or what, but my DVD is fine.  I've watched it several times since buying it, and the film remains chilling to this day.  Buy it, but don't look for Freddy or Jason or even Michael Meyers-type horror; this is much more of a game of the mind.",N/A
320392,"Contains music and sound effects.I didn't fully appreciate Charlie Chaplin until I became a mature adult and had learned what respectible work he had done.  I once got into City Limits (1931).  Chaplin was a short funny man.  It wasn't until I saw him as an older gentleman in a clip on the Academy Awards program that aired April 10, 1972, when he was being honored that I realized him.  It was his first trip back in America in years and he said to the audience, ""you dear people"", with tears in his eyes.  He was so humble.Turner Classic Movies recently ran a 24-hour marathon of Chaplin films in August 2004.  He did do films that were speaking roles.  He was so brilliant in A King In New York (1957).  Modern Times (1936) is Chaplin at his best.  The first 18 minutes with Chaplin as a factory worker is hilarious.  I was shocked to see the muscled-man factory worker ""Section Five"" with his shirt always off here in this 1936 film.Chaplin is a factory worker and possibly the best, but he gets no respect.  Not even enough time to use the bathroom.  The boss even tries a new invention on getting the employees to eat faster.  Chaplin goes insane, or rather, has a nervous breakdown, and is sent to jail for disturbing and damaging the factory.  Now out of jail and the factory closed down, Chaplin just walks the street.  he finds a dropped flag from a truck and he picks it up.  Suddenly, a stampede of angry Union Workers come from behind him.  He innocently gets mixed in with the crowd and the police see the flag he is holding and he is sent to jail again.  That is just the beginning of the story.There are hundreds of funny bits in thi film, but what is disturbing to me is when the little guy mistakenly is sent to jail all over again.  But when he gets out, he does find love in a woman (Paulette Goodard, who later became Chaplin's real wife).Gloria DeHaven is one of the young orphans.  She was the daughter of Chaplin's assistant director.Last ""silent"" film for Charlie Chaplin.  He continued in films with speaking roles until 1967.",N/A

What he has released is a very different film, with a much different feel.  Gone is the clastrophobic feeling of the movie.  This is Star Wars rewriting all over again.  Can't say I'm suprised by this.  Lucas seems to be the only director out there that forces only one edition on us, while basically acting like the old versions don't exist anymore.  Lucas doesnt realize that he is already hated by most of his original fans for what he has done with Star Wars and now THX too.My personal opinion based only on my impressions of Lucas's rather narrow-focused mind, is that Howard the Duck, both loved and hated, will never make its way onto DVD only because Lucas doesn't want to associate himself with it anymore.Lucas may be a wealthy man, but he's no Jedi Master.",N/A

110714,"""Falling Down"" is a sly combination of a social commentary, a conventional action movie, and a sad character study. It's an odd and sometimes unsettling mix - sometimes the horror of what we're watching is undermined by the catchphrase-laden dialogue of our anti-hero - but it's a compelling, reasonably gutsy movie that raises a lot of questions.Michael Douglas, mostly known as D-FENS, has snapped. He leaves his car on a blistering day in LA and goes for a walk, only to face a series of annoyances that Larry David woulda loved - irritating convenience-store policies, fast-food fascism, gang-bangers, even a neo-nazi. Instead of cracking wise, however, D-FENS responds with violence and vandalism.Meanwhile, back at the LAPD, Robert Duvall is a low-impact cop on his last day of the job. He's not well-liked, even though he seems to be a perfectly nice guy. He starts tracking these strange reports of a white nerd on a rampage, and ultimately gets involved with the case.The movie seems designed to generate controversy, with its casual xenophobia and the sometimes pandering actions of the Michael Douglas character. Look deeper, though, and you'll note that Duvall's cop is basically a well-adjusted version of D-FENS. Both men feel utterly insignificant, only Duvall has learned how to laugh and get through life, while Douglas is bewildered and disillusioned - and deeply sad.Things get even more confused when we learn Douglas has shown violence toward his family in the past, and may have a sinister goal in mind. This is probably unsettling to those who have been cheering him on, but who can blame them? Douglas is given pithy dialogue and exit lines for each of his encounters, as if we're supposed to applaud when he destroys, say, a Korean man's business. If Schumacher had downplayed the mayhem, or showed the violence as the actions of a desperate, sadly warped man (instead of a spokesman for the overlooked white man), the movie would have more power. But would anyone want to see it? The movie's ambivalence about the actions of D-FENS is fascinating and refreshingly non-judgmental.""Falling Down"" is just as haunting for its flaws as its virtues. If it's meant to be a commentary, it undercuts itself with its action sequences. As an action drama, however, it's pretty deep and fearless in presenting men of quiet desperation - and two different methods for conquering it.",N/A
890342,"Joel Schumacher's film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most famous musical, Phantom Of The Opera, is in theatres now and deserves Oscar recognition. It is without a doubt an incredibly powerful movie. It packs a visual splendor, beautiful musical score and emotional ride that so few films do. To many, mistakingly, this film is only a ""movie musical"" or overdone, lavish nonsense. It's not. I have seen this movie several times and each time, there is magic  to be noted in every detail. First of all, one must seperate themselves entirely from the Lloyd Webber stage musical, which first appeared on Broadway back in 1986. Sarah Brightman starred as Christine and Michael Crawford as the Phantom. THIS IS NOT THAT VERSION. While to many that is the ultimate and musically, it is superior, this one, starring Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler, is a glorious modern, youth-oriented ""movement"" towards the performing arts as cinema.It uses the latest in visual effects and sound to make a musical much more than a musical. It becomes a powerful, striking emotional romantic tragedy with theatrical roots.Seeing this film has made me appreciate the musical as well as the cinema with historical/musical background. Lloyd Webber has already used cinema to promote his staged Broadway shows- the first being 1974's Jesus Christ Superstar. Schumacher captures the real Phantom of the Opera in its essence. There are things that movies can do that staged plays or musicals, operas, can never do. Subtle things reveal powerful symbols or emotions. In this movie, it's a portrait of a tragic figure- the Phantom. Born a freak, showcased shamelessly in a circus which results in his father's suicide, the Phantom is rescued by the kind-hearted Madame Giry, the ballet instructor, who hides him under the Paris Opera house. He lives isolated in the deep caverns by the lake under the theatre, listening to opera and music his whole life. He develops creative talent for composing music himself. Anonymously, he trains Christine to sing his music. Eventually, when Christine is a star, he falls in love with her, though there is a teacher-student relationship in the center of it. Through Christine, he is a better man and less a monster. She makes him feel love and the warmth of human kindness. Through her singing, the world hears his soul, which is both passionate, intense, painful, romantic, sensitive and bitter. Christine is in love with Raol, a young aristocrat who was a childhood friend. The fact that at the end, even after a scary attempt of keeping her for himself, the Phantom releases Christine and allows her to marry Raol, shows how much his love for her has changed him. This is one of the most moving romances I have ever seen, though it shares in that same theme with another French novel, Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and even slight elements of Beauty and the Beast.Visually, this movie is unsurpassed. It's likely it will win Oscars for Best Costumes or Best Song (Minni Driver's own song ""Learn To Be Lonely""). The use of computer graphics and original sets to imitate the Garnier Paris Opera is exquisite. The chandelier, the rose, the Phantom's mask, the toy monkey, are all powerful romantic symbols. The acting is top-notch. We have here Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, totally devoting herself to the role. Gerard Butler's Phantom carries most of the weight. He is as powerful and frightening as he is tender and vulnerable. We see through his ""shrine to Christine"" that he is obscessed with her. We see through Christine's facial expressions that she is probably more in love with the Phantom than with Raol, but being a public figure, or wanting children (she becomes a mother) she cannot live a happy, normal life with an ostracized figure like the Phantom. The cinematic treatment of using black and white as the present day for the older Phantom who has outlived Christine and is remembering in full color memory all the events of the story is wonderful.Emmy Rossum as Christine is a treat. Her light voice pales in comparison to the more dramatic-lyric, bigger voice of Sarah Brightman, but Rossum holds her own. She was educated in opera at the Metoropolitan Opera Chorus in New York City with Eleanor Doria, who still instructs young children and young adults in the world of opera. Though she is essentially a lyric coloratura, she can deliver a powerful performance charged with raw emotion. Minnie Driver as the stereotypical bitchy, arrogant and bossy diva Carlotta is a riot. She gets a lot of laughs. Her voice is dubbed by a different singer whose own dramatic, Maria Callas type voice is used for comic effect. This movie has everything. It's both light and dark, funny and tragic, powerful in its melancholy beauty and will haunt you years afterward, casting a spell of enchantment that so many few films do today.",N/A
532901,"First of all let me say that I have never played the Dungeons & Dragons game before.  I'm familiar with only the Saturday morning cartoon and a couple of the books.  Being a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I was always aware of D&D;, but never pursued any interest any it.  Having said that, I was surprised at how decent this movie really was.  Granted, there are a ton of films that are a lot better than this fantasy flick, but it was a nice way to kill a little time on a Saturday morning.  There were some good and some bad things about this film.  Here's a look at all of them.First of all, the guts of this story were very good.  The tale of two thieves and their cohorts seeking out a powerful sceptor has been told before, but it is played out very well in this movie.  It's plays out at a rather quick pace and never gets boring.  Justin Whalin, Marlon Wayans, and their group are all excellent in this film.  Bruce Payne was also a perfect foil to their plans.  I actually felt a little sorry for his character.The special effects were okay considering the massive amount used in this picture.  They don't take away from the story at all.  The battle of the dragons was done pretty good, though I wish we would have been given a larger dose of the action.It was very nice to see Tom Baker on the screen.  Fans of the BBC series ""Doctor Who"" will remember him as the beloved fourth Doctor.  I'll be honest and say that I didn't recognize him initially, but when I realized who he was, it felt good to see him once again.The movie gets pretty ugly when, unfortunately, Jeremy Irons or Thora Birch enters the frame.  Irons seems to be overacting in an attempt to be the dreaded nemesis he is supposed to be.  It's funny how sometimes Irons can be such a brilliant bad guy, and then stumble his way through a film such as this or ""The Time Machine.""  Birch is completely out of character in this movie.  She is such a good actress in her other films(American Beauty, Ghost World, etc.), but she doesn't seem to be able to grasp the character she is playing.  I would think that such a radical character would have been played with more emotion, or at least some emotion.  The ending is abrupt and uneventful.  Sure, the bad guy gets his in the end, but the ending only serves as a point to quickly shut the movie down.Once again, the real story, the better story, is between Whalin, his friends, and the character portrayed by Bruce Payne.  Had they been the entire focus of the film, it probably would have been much better.Recommended to folks who enjoy fantasy but don't take it too seriously.  In other words, if you play dress-up on days not associated with Halloween or a Renaissance festival, you probably won't like this.",Dungeons & Dragons

825833,"This movie misses part of the importance of the original.  Some of the cast is good, but one or two play bad teeny-boppers with 2-dimensional minds.  Yes, this movie is gory, especially this unrated version which is all I've seen.  Yet, it doesn't really compare to the things that made the original Romero film great.  Lately, the movie industry seems to turn out a lot of ""highly fueled, action-packed"" remakes of great films, and I don't know why.  Admittedly, this movie isn't very bad, but I was disappointed this movie was remade at all.  The best part of this remake might have been getting sickened watching a guy with a chainsaw accidentally falling on a girl and cutting her in half when the driver overturns the van in a get-away scene.  I don't see a point here.The original Romero flick had a point.  It was nightmarish and a statement about American consumerism, and a black comedy towards our society.  It also has superb editing, like that of a Sam Peckinpah film.  The zombies in the original don't run around like an action film, they walk like entranced mall shoppers; which is the way we ""zombified"" people look when we're at the mall ourselves.  It doesn't matter if it looked SILLY or even dated.  The horror partly derives out of that.  It makes little sense to hype it.Why REmake a great film??  Can anybody explain this so other people understand?  The ONLY great thing ""remakes"" (of great films) do is come to home video, so the original good movie gets released to DVD (or re-released with a new authoritative DVD as in this case), and then I can go BUY THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC!  The only time movie people should ever remake a film is if the original wasn't very good, but has potential.  Hitchcock remade his own film, as did Cecil B. DeMille, which is more like correcting an error.  ""Dawn"" did not need to be remade!  Romero did fine!  The Romero Exception is ""Night Of the Living Dead"" because Romero's SFX makeup/prothetics man, Tom Savini who worked on all three Romero classics, directed the new one and it is an interesting change from the classic that stood on its own.Maybe I'm being a little harsh.  Some of it was memorable.  But, I'm not grateful.Romero is a competent filmmaker with some ability.  Why can't he get the budget he wants?  Why didn't those idiots who produced those terrible Resident Evil films let Romero direct their project?  Maybe making money is something I shouldn't sneer at, but unless I'm a lain-brain twit, I should want some return on the money I spend.  I can go see any slam-bang action film any day of the week, but I can't always find a film with intellectual stimulation and presence.  They should have given Resident Evil to Romero and begged him to stay rather than cave to the politics of the franchise ownership who know nothing of making movies.  The reason to get Romero is not because he will do what they say, but because you can trust him to follow his conscience.  When you get Romero, you have an interesting movie.  I point to the latest Resident Evil Apocalypse and rest my case.",Dawn of the Dead

Before Hammond(Richard Attenborough) can open his park he must get it sponsored by the tops in the dinosaur and science fields.

I can remember being nine years old and just being awe inspired by this movie. The Dinosaurs look fantastic. Industrial Light and Magic did a great job creating the prehistoric creatures. They really are breat defeying throughout the movie. The movie is shot so well. Spielberg is a master story teller and he sets everything up well. The movie uses so many things to make it good. There is action, suspense, comedey, and just enough seriousness to make you think.Jeff Goldblum as Ian Macolm to me had the best performance of all the actors in the film. Very few people in Hollywood can reach the level of weirdness that Goldblum can achieve on screen and he has another one of a kind performance in Jurrassic Park.All the other actors are solid all the way across. It'a a fantastic cast. It's solid all the way around with stars like Neil, Dern, Samuel L. Jackson, and Goldblum. Goldblum has the best performance, but the others don't disappoint.The music is great in Jurrasic Park. Once again John Williams has shown us why he's the man in one of the best movies ever scored. If you like to see why Williams is the best just watch the movie and see how his score makes the movie so much better.This is a fantastic movie. At one time it was the most successful movie in box office history and it's easy to see why. It's a fun movie. It doesn't insult the hit book it was made from. It raises questions on whether cloning should be legal. It's a cinematic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all.",N/A

Watching it again, it's actually pretty bad. The space alien plot is goofy at best, the dialogue is ridiculous, and the characters are uninteresting. Still, there's plenty of rubber suited monster action in the last third to keep fans interested. (Some fans, by the way, are bothered by the scene where a Godzilla prototype attacks American troupes in the second world war).&quot;Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth&quot; is also a pretty stupid movie (with unineteresting characters, unrealistic sets, and goofy dialogue), but I found it to be the more fun of the two. There are some pretty good monster fights between Mothra, Godzilla, and 'Battra' near the end, and the Mothra lullaby song sung by the two 'cosmos' (from the original 1960s &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;) has still not come out of my head.The DVD is unfortunately, not in widescreen (unlike the companian double feature, &quot;Godzilla vs. Spacegodzilla&quot;/&quot;Godzilla vs. Destroyah&quot;). The 1.33:1 image looks similar to a video tape (especially in the opening shots of &quot;King Ghidorah&quot;), but it's acceptable enough. The only audio is the english dub (apparently at the request of Toho studios), but it really doesn't matter in movies like these.

Paramount tried to play it off as another ""Armageddon"", and so people looking for mindless, testosterone-laden entertainment were completely put off by the profound, philosophical nature of Deep Impact's story line.  The title of the film itself seems to indicate that the film is a deep emotional analysis of how people react when they know they are about to die, as opposed to a film about blowing up a chunk of ice hurtling towards the Earth.  Granted, there are liberties taken in the scientific accuracy department, but that doesn't detract from the story unless you are really uptight about such things.  If you go to every movie hoping they will be completely scientifically accurate, then you will be disappointed all the time.So, when you watch this film, don't look at it as being a high-adrenaline action film - look at it as a film about sacrifice, making peace before one dies, and the triumph of the human spirit.",Deep Impact VHS

It stars matinee idol, Joel McCrea as Johnny Jones, a New York reporter dispatched to Europe who inadvertently stumbles upon a troupe of fascists preparing to take over the world.  After witnessing an assassination, Jones becomes embroiled in the harrowing plot of secret government codes falling into the wrong hands. Along the way, he encounters Carol Fisher (Laraine Day) whose father, Stephan (Herbert Marshall) may or may not be the lynch pin in all the espionage. Both the mood and charm of many of the film's set pieces speaks to Hitchcock's flair for European cinema.

It has most of its elements, indeed, still director Gus Van Sant is able to make it work without falling into some easy traps and melodramatic common-places.Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, apparently a young loser who hasn`t a bright future ahead of him. Yet, as he soon discovers, Will is in fact a bright, highly gifted youngster with an uncommon talent to maths. The plot is rich enough to showcase his growing process and further development, even if occasional predictable scenes unfold.Van Sant suceeds in delivering an enticing and poignant story about self-discovery, isolation, friendship and communication, yet it seems to gets dangerously close to Hollywood fluff in a couple of moments (just close, as it never becomes truly cutesy or embarassing).The acting also helps a little to make the effort work, since besides Damon it includes convincing performances from Robbin Williams, Minnie Driver and Ben and Casey Affleck. The soundtrack is a plus, too, including Danny Elfman and indie talents like Elliot Smith, the Dandy Warhols or Luscious Jackson.&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; is a solid, consistent movie worth watching, yet it is far from being a milestone or a work of genius.

Films--and art in general--are nothing more than manipulation in order to achieve a desired effect, whether to scare us, make us cry, or make us laugh. It's all about manipulation. I read Billy Hayes original book accounting his true life experiences in Turkey; overall, the film holds true to the autobiography, although it shies away from Hayes's own self-professed positive homosexual experiences while in prison. I suppose audiences in 1978 wouldn't be able to handle that. In the film, Hayes is shown as rejecting any kind of homosexual advance, although he does so kindly. Regardless, the film is powerful and has visually stunning cinematography, something that is lacking in today's films. This is one of those films you show friends who have never seen it or heard of it. Almost all will come away awestruck. It is a remarkable film achievement.

There are 18 of them here, ranging from 1939 to 1953.  In many of them, Mickey plays a supporting role, usually to Pluto.  He still gets chances to shine in such shorts as ""Mickey's Delayed Date"" and ""Mickey and the Seal.""  I especially enjoyed ""Tugboat Mickey,"" although here Donald and Goofy get to shine more then Mickey does.

I was hoping it would be the one I grew up watching on TV, but it makes sense it wouldn't be.  There's also a fun Easter Egg to find.Disc Two brings us Mickey's comeback of the 80's and 90's.  Here we get three cartoons, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol,"" ""The Prince and the Pauper,"" and ""Runaway Brain.""  Personally, I'm thrilled to have the first on DVD since I watching it every Christmas.  The second is a fun reworking of Mark Twain's classic.  I remember not being impressed with the final one when I saw it in the theater, and my impression still holds up today.  All three are presented in wide screen since, being more modern, that's their original aspect ratio.The second disc is where you'll find the majority of the bonus features.  These include interviews with current animators who have worked on Mickey and an interesting interview with the current voices for Mickey and Minnie.  Other highlights include Mickey's appearances on ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" opening, two ""Tricks of our Trade"" episodes of Disneyland, and a special from the 80's on the making of ""Mickey's Christmas Carol.""For those looking for more Mickey Mouse shorts on DVD, this will certainly fit the bill.

778802,"I got really excited when first hearing about this movie.  It's not every day one stumbles across an odd pairing of two of their favorite pastimes, in my case horror films and snowboarding.  Upon examining the DVD box at the rental store however my enthusiasm dimmed somewhat as it become obvious to me just what kind of horror film this was going to be: a straight-to-vid dime-a-dozen self-referential cookie cutter slasher film.  The sort of horror film that's pumped out by studios such as Fox Home Entertainment and Artisan Entertainment with inhuman regularity and readily available at your local chain video store since it contains very little amounts of graphic gore and lots of pretty faces who unfortunately can't act their way out of paper bags.The ""Rocky Summit"" was a popular family-owned ski resort that has been closed for many years now due to an ugly incident where three drunk snowboarders inadvertently led a young girl to her death by making her ski straight into a tree.  The ski resort went bankrupt but the property was bought by a rich investor, Mr. Van Arts.  His daughter Kimberly decides to round up a few of her friends and head out to the abandoned resort for a weekend of partying and ""Shredding"", as the young daredevils like to put it.  Unbeknownst to them a maniac is on the loose in the resort, someone who despises snowboarders and hasn't forgotten about the murder of the little girl several years ago.Anyone considering renting this film strictly for snowboarding elements should definitely reconsider as the film has next to no snowboarding maneuvers, just a gang of teenagers lazily cruising down the slopes.  There is one member of the gang named Kurk who apparently won a high-profile local context and who is a runner-up to qualify for the next Olympics.  Curious then that in a two-minute demo the only tricks he is able to pull are a couple of 540's and a bunch of uninspired tail grabs.  Obviously the filmmakers didn't spend too much money on trying to attract quality stunt doubles.  Besides the lack of tricks there are stereotypes about the sport in this movie that will make any experienced rider cringe and grit their teeth such as juvenile pop-punk music playing throughout, a horde of product plugs(everyone in the movie wears ""Dragon"" snowboard goggles even the killer who supposedly hates everything associated with the sport) and of course the requisite hyperactive tweenie geek who keeps uttering outdated lingo like ""gnarly"", ""rad"" and can't finish a sentence without uttering the word ""dude"" whether he is speaking to someone male or female.There are a couple of positives that I must point out however.  Shot on location in Kellogg, Idaho, the viewer is treated to stunning mountain locales.  When the snow falls, we know that it's real.  And of course there's also plenty of eye-candy although the film's quite conservative in the nudity department.  Amazingly, Shredder starts off quite promisingly.  We are treated to a high-speed chase down the slopes, a snowboarder on the run from the maniac killer.  The snowboarder dies a gruesome and gory death in very creative fashion.  Then the opening credits roll and that's the end of the gore, really.  Many of the murders are off screen and very little blood is shown, even when someone's head is chopped right off their neck.  Some of the scenes are cheesy beyond belief, especially since the tone of the film is serious.  It's too bad because I liked the concept but Shredder managed to disappoint both the snowboard and slasher fan in me.",N/A
243396,"I saw this movie on sale for only $3 so I got it. Hey, what do I have to lose? Well, I lost $3. Even for a measley $3 I feel ripped off. There is no redeeming quality in this movie, it drags and drags with no substance, not a single scary or enlightening moment. Just a really bad 70's film. It had Poor film quality, corny dialouge, ridiculous zombies (were they even trying to make them look liek zombies), boring music scores. The basis of the stroy was some guy's brother gets the electric chair. And before his brother died, he made a promise to find the real killer of his sister in law. Turns out there was some stupid plot about a zombie master. The story on the back of the box made it sound like a big epic apocalyptic movie because the &quot;Zombie Master&quot; (who's just some old ugly guy) tries to take over the world with zombies (which are just people that give you blank stares, oh yeah and there was only one zombie) Throughout the whole film I was so bored that I actually wished I was in math class! By all means avoid at all costs and if you haven't seen this pathetic excuse of a movie yet, count your blessings. The title makes it soudns like one of those artsy italian zombie films but it's not. The movie has no effect on the viewers at all. You'll just see fuzzy people talking about silly things and giving poor performances over a story that doesn't make sense.

785039,"Underworld is a great looking movie that has a similar look and feel to it as films like the Matrix and the Crow. The way Kate Beckinsale (Pearl Harbor) is dressed in all leather sis even sort of a rip-off of Trinity in the Matrix. Hey though she looks great so I'm not going to complain lol. The movie is hard to follow somtimes though. It throws too much at you in one movie and it becomes to complexed to follow. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman (Felicity) don't really have great chemestry either eventhough they are good in their roles.I mean we know why he likes her, I mean mmmm lol. We don't know why she is willing to risk everything for him though when she hardly even knows him. Still though Kate Beckinsale surprisingly is in strong heroine form and it's impressive since she's been in basically only romance movies before this. She handles the role well even if she comes off as more of a super model with attitude than a vampire. Anyway I always wanted to see a vampires vs werewolves movie and we get that with Underworld. There's not really enough action with them verse each other though. Yes they shoot at each other but I'd rather see more of them actually fighting. It's still pretty cool though. I think the werewolves look better than most werewolves have looked. Underworld is a fun movie that you'll enjoy more if you just sit back and let the action wash over you.",N/A

The vocals on ""Long Train Running"" and the music/sound mix on ""South City Midnight Lady"" were not 5 stars worthy.

If Duvall were a one-man show for this one it would be worth buying and watching again and again and again.Resurrecting the magic he created as Gus in LONESOME DOVE, Duvall is sensational as Boss Spearman, a straight talking, straight shooting, no nonsense cowman who wants his freedom and an open range to roam in. Costner does well as Spearman's partner, Charley Waite, a man who is hiding from a sordid past and wants nothing more than to be left alone. Annette Bening effortlessly steps into the role of Kate Barlow, a tough frontier ""nurse"" who finds that Charley has a heart and determines to make it hers.When a ruthless rancher kills a friend, wounds another and threatens to take their herd Waite and Spearman are forced to take action.

799205,"The Matrix: Revolutions picks up right where The Matrix: Reloaded left off, so everyone is trying to figure out what happened to Neo (Keanu Reeves) and how to save him.  But when Neo finally gets out of the Matrix, he comes back changed and he has discovered some disturbing information that will force him to make some difficult decisions.  Neo finds that he can't even confide in Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and that, although he is still The One, he doesn't quite believe that he can make a difference anymore.  After spending a lot of time alone, Neo comes to the conclusion that he must go up to the surface and fight the machines on the old battleground, not just through the matrix.  His other teammates try and dissuade him, but with Trinity by his side, Neo heads for the surface.  Little does he know that Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has a few surprises in store for him along the way...Meanwhile, the rest of the crew heads back to Zion, all too aware that the fate of humankind may rest on their shoulders.  For while they are trying to avoid the machines on their way home, the machines are attacking Zion and are programmed to destroy every living thing that remains.  The inhabitants of Zion are not about to let their city go without a fight, however, and they use all of their old machinery and ammunition to try and keep the machines at bay.  The Council will do just about anything to buy Neo more time, because in these last desperate hours all they have is hope...I thought that this movie was wonderful in some ways and a disappointment in others.  First off, I have to admit that I hated the ending.  I can't quite figure out if the directors were trying to leave the Matrix open for future sequels or if they just wanted to stay all mystical and let people draw their own conclusions.  I disagree with others, however, in that they say that the directors never answered any of their questions - the directors never made any plans to answer questions and from the outset it was obvious that the Matrix was always going to be a kind of shadowland that kept its own secrets.  Most of the special effects were still amazing, but I expected this and almost expected them to be even better because this was the third and final movie in the trilogy and it should have just knocked my socks off.  If anyone else had done the special effects, I probably would have been a lot more impressed, but the directors raised the bar so high with the first film that they were their own worst enemies.  I was also a bit disappointed that they relied so heavily on CGI instead of on stunt work because that was what made all of the fight scenes so cool.  This movie was also quite a bit drabber than the others because there was hardly any time spent in the Matrix and I have to admit that I missed all of the sweet outfits they used to wear there.  On the positive side, there were some great scenes in Zion as individuals fought hard to withstand the machines and one of my favorite characters was the Kid (Clayton Watson) who worshipped Neo and turned out to be a hero.  There were some touching moments between Link and his wife and Hugo Weaving, playing Agent Smith, was a great villain.  The sets were still incredibly imaginative and there were some fun one-liners as well, so there are some good parts to the movie.  All in all, I must admit that I enjoyed myself in the theatre and felt that it was money well spent, but it wasn't the spectacular finish that I had envisioned...",N/A

Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey have great chemistry as two people who are attempting to use each other to advance their own careers:  Andie (Hudson) is a journalist attempting to write a feature article on things women do to drive men away (hence the title ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days""), and McConaughey plays an advertising executive who makes a bet with his coworkers that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days, and if he wins the bet, he'll land a major account with his firm.  The plot isn't exactly relaistic, but there are some hilarious scenes in this movie.  Hudson's psychotic episodes are hysterical, and I gained a whole new respect for her as an actress after seeing her in this role.  The pace kind of slows down in the last third of the film, and the ending is kind of predictable and could have been a lot funnier, in my opinion.

705878,"Knowing some of the people involved with this true story and having met General Harold Moore and Joe Galloway a few years ago I felt a necessity to see the film as soon as possible (ASAP). I had read their co-authored book We Were Soldiers Once and Young so I already knew what to expect of the film. I knew that neither he nor Joe wanted just any Hollywood company to turn their book into a fiasco. They wanted the truth told and shown so Americans could learn about one particular unit and the major battle they fought in 1965.I knew that Mel Gibson was at Fort Benning, Georgia (GA) preparing to make the film. I also knew that they moved the film crew out to Fort Hunter-Liggett in California for the actual battle scenes. I was aware that the producer, director, screenplay writer and company involved with making the movie had also done &quot;Braveheart&quot; which won five Academy Awards a few years ago. I felt they would stick to reality rather than sugar coating the true story. While some things were changed to make the movie from the book most of it was as real as possible.The movie began by showing French soldiers being massacred in June 1954 in the IaDrang Valley by the North Vietnamese. This valley became known as the Valley of Death and was often compared to GEN Custer's battle at the Little Big Horn. This was the first intense battle scene of the film but it was far from being the last.Although this film was about the IaDrang Valley battle of November 1965 it also showed the public much more. It gave you the opportunity to meet certain characters up close and personal. It shows the wives, families, how they were affected and how these women helped each other during this time in history as well as their spouses and children.On Sunday 14 November 1965 the 1/7, made up of about 400 US soldiers, arrived at Landing Zone (LZ) Xray and soon found themselves up against more than 2000 North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldiers. For the next three days the soldiers battled the enemy. Precise times and locations were scrolled across the bottom of the screen. This entire part of the film is very intense. There were firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and bombing missions, which were so close to our own men that there were friendly fire casualties.As darkness engulfed the battalion things got worse. LTC Moore walked among his soldiers reassuring them and telling them they did well to that point and to continue. Casualties were mounting. Moore was seen several times praying over the dead and wounded members of his battalion. This showed his compassion even more for his men.As word was spreading back home of casualties the wives soon found out that the Army was not prepared for this. Taxicab drivers were delivering those dreaded telegrams. For whatever reason it showed that there were no chaplains or counselors there to handle this process. I don't recall that ever really happening so I'm hoping that was just a little bit of the Hollywood effect put on the film. Whatever the case was, in this movie Julie Moore took it upon herself to deliver all the messages to the spouses of her husband's soldiers.Meanwhile Joe Galloway knew that there was heavy fighting going on and he jumped onboard a chopper to go see for himself. Armed only with several cameras he goes into the heat of the battle. When asked why he was there Galloway said to help the people home understand the war by shooting pictures not a rifle. More air strikes are called in and one of the men Joe came to know briefly was badly burned. He carried him to a waiting chopper. This was a rather gruesome scene.The second and third days of battle weren't any better. The NVA kept bringing in fresh troops as our soldiers were trying to continue the battle themselves. LTC Moore asked for a head count of his men and when he found two were missing he went out himself looking for them.As Joe Galloway continued shooting pictures Moore said &quot;I'll never forgive myself that my men died and I didn't.&quot; Joe commented, &quot;I don't know how to tell this story.&quot; And Moore's response was &quot;You got to Joe. Tell them how my troopers died.&quot;LTC Moore refused to leave the IaDrang till all his men living or dead were taken off the field of battle. He kept his promise although 234 of his troopers died. LTC Moore wrote personal letters to each deceased soldier's family. His compassion continued throughout the next 235 days his battalion was in Vietnam and to this day.Before the credits rolled there was a brief narration about how our soldiers returned home with no bands, flags, or welcomes. The soldiers knew they fought for each other. The final scene was one of two soldiers, one in a wheelchair, going down what appeared to be an airport hallway. A woman with her children approached them and she pulled the children away from the soldiers as if they were diseased or something.The names of the fallen soldiers of the 1/7 are listed on Panel 3 East of The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Moore and Galloway told their story well. Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson portrayed it excellently.Though graphic in nature this is a MUST SEE movie. Be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions. I believe the film has shown what the IaDrang Valley battle was really like. Those people who may be squeamish about blood, burns, broken burns, etc might want to stay home. BUT if you are a true fan and prefer seeing war movies-this is the one to go to! You not only see the battle scenes but also learn some of the relationship between the men, their wives, and families.",N/A

You have a bunch of children who don't want to move, leave their school and friends, getting used to new schools, and playing major pranks on each other and on a boyfriend.  You have one child who feels like an outsider, but the other siblings do really love him.

She is dating her boyfriend who is an actor her siblings don't like.The scene that is so funny and I kept watching over and over and over again was the scene when the dog attacks the boyfriend whose shorts were soaked in meat.  He is grabbing the floor and his screams reach a falsetto that just had me laughing and crying so hard.  I love that scene!!!!  Then he leaves the house and is chased by more dogs and has to jump in his car.  What a riot!!!!The story is ultimately about finding a happy medium, and deciding what is more important.

793234,"Based on the John Grisham book, Runaway Jury is a fine court thriller in the same vein as The Pelican Brief and The Firm. However, as oppossed to those films, it's much more predictable, and that takes a lot out of the movie - how much can you be thrilled if you *know* what's gonna happen?A big guns manufacturing firm is taken to court by the widow of a stock broker killed by a deranged co-worker using an automatic weapon built by said firm. As you would expect, it's the biggest trial to come along in some time as there are large interests in its results. The victims want some retribution for their loss, but if the gun companies lose it will set a precedent from which many future cases can also be lost. Both sides bring in the big guns (pun intended) not only hiring top lawyers to handle the case (Hoffman and Davison), but also hiring jury selection firms to watch over the pciking of who's gonna be one of the twelve jurors. Enter Rankin Fitch (Hackman), an expert in manipulating mury selection. He uses leading edge technology and a large team of people to figure out any and everything there is to know about the jurors, and if necessary, put enough pressure in them to guarantee a winning decision.One of the would-be jurors is Nick Easter (Cusack), a part owner of an electronics store, who seems to have his own reasons to be part of the jury. Once the selection starts and both sides do their best to include jurors who they think will favor them, or to exclude those who would vote against their clients. However, they don't realize at first that Nick is doing some manipulation himself. With the help of his girlfriend, Marlee (Weisz), Nick manages to be chosen as juror #9, and once he's in, him and Marlee start threatening both sides - they can make the decision swing to either side, whoever pays them more will be on the winning end. From then on, most of the movie reveals Nick's and Marlee's plan as well as how the lawyers react, trying to stop them.There is a somewhat decent twist ending, although as I said before, it's quite predictable and that's the real weakness of the film. I had already read the book, but by wife, who hasn't, also saw the ending coming a mile away.The big plus in this film is the acting. The four leading characters are portrayed by two Hollywood legends with four Oscars between them and two great actors of a younger generation. Cusack is argueably the lead, as he has the most screen time. His character drives the story - he's the one on the inside, moving and shaking things in order to control the outcome. He does a real good job. Weisz has probably the least screen time of the foursome, and she does very well with a limited character (she is, however, quite hot!). Hoffman does a fine job as Wendell Rohr, the plaintiff's lawyer, who wants to win this case to change gun control laws and to stick it to the large gun companies. But the movie belongs to Hackman. He is the villain of the film, he's the bad guy in the story, and as with most movies, he gets the best dialogues and the best scenes. He's a canniving, heartless man who knows that in order to control people you have to learn their deepest, darkest secrets and then use them against them. He doesn't care about the victims or the people involved in the trial, he only wants to win and he shows it when he says &quot;someone always loses in court. Only not me&quot;.If you're a Grisham fan (either his books or the movies based on them) you shouldn't miss this film. If you like court room dramas, you'll enjoy this movie. Just don't expect to be blown away by it.On a final note, has anyone else noticed that this is Hackman's third Grisham-based movie? He was in The Firm, The Chamber and now this. Odd.",N/A
1354,"The Passion of the Christ is fairly faithful to the bible it was based on.  Because it's only based on one section of the New Testament, it does feel like watching a film adaptation of the end of a book.  I am well-versed in the Bible, so this wasn't a problem for me, but I feel it was a bit exclusionary to not include some backstory (even though the title clearly reveals that it's a cinematic passion play).Mel Gibson's directing and Caleb Deschanel's cinematography bring the film to vivid life.  This is the second time in a year that I've praised Deschanel's camera work in a film.  The man is becoming a force to be reckoned with.The film is far from perfect, but it's worth a viewing.  The DVD itself has a clean and pristine picture that really brings out the blues used during the nighttime scenes.

502872,"right-- so the first time i saw this i didn't think it was funny. i didn't even like it!  i didn't even know it was supposed to be a comedy.  i was young then.  i watched it again recently and i see now that it's hilarious!  it's one of the funniest movies i have ever seen.  it's a twisted kind of funny, but that's the best.  once you get over the child molesting and drugging and graphic sexual language it is really funny.  the acting is really really good in this movie.  i think that gets overlooked because the story is so bent.  but i think people can relate to some of the monsters in this movie.  you don't have to molest your son's friend or kill your doorman to understand these people's motivations.  they only do what they do out of desperation.  the stories told in this movie aren't the ones you usually hear so i think people are repelled. but honestly i think it's great that a filmmaker dared to make a comedy about monsters.  the movie doesn't try to make you feel bad for these monsters but it helps you understand why they do these odd, unspeakable things.  i like watching other people watch this movie and seeing the look on their faces at certain parts.  if you don't like this movie and consider it an abuse of art and that it goes too far, i understand.  i felt the same way when i first saw it too.  i recommend a second viewing and look closer this time.",N/A

SEUSS for crying out loud!  I must admit, I have never been a real fan of CAT IN THE HAT....even in book form.  Even though I didn't like it, I decided to try the movie out based upon word of mouth...and it wasn't all that bad. Alec Baldwin didn't really fit in this movie....I just couldn't see him being in something family-oriented.  Other than that, it was pretty funny....and better than people give it credit for being.  The highlights of the film have to be S.L.O.W. and the awesome rave club scene!If you just can't part with $20, then go ahead and spend $4 and rent this one.  It probably could have been a lot better....but don't dismiss it because of the negative things you have heard about it...you'll be missing out on a cute little movie.",Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat
505690,"If ever the statement that the movie is not as good as the book is true, it applies to Kubrick's ""Lolita"".  I really like the movie on its own, but it bears little resemblance to the novel (my favorite) other than young girl/old man, the names, and the broadest structure of the story.Problem areas:1. Age - by Humbert's definition, a nymphet is between 9 and 14 years old. Sue Lyon was too old, and looked even older. Mason was about 10 years too old as well, and not really the ""glamour man"" Lo would be attracted to (as in the book).2. Disregard for the content of the novel - by ignoring the screenplay written by the original author and making up other scenes that were not part of the book, it makes one wonder what story was being told.3. Location - in the novel, Humbert and Lolita travel 27,000 miles in the course of a couple years, and geography plays a substantial part in the book. Filming in England provides little geography and motel-hopping lifestyle that was so prevalent in the novel.4. The same three things in both versions of the movie bother me, as I feel it robs Humbert of some nuance to his character:A. No mention of his pre-Lolita first wife, Valeria. He was not always just into nymphets.B. No mention of his post-Lolita second wife, Rita, (and taping a goodbye note to her navel so she would find it as he goes off to track down Lo).C. The last page-and-a-half from the book was left out. This is possibly the most moving passage of the novel - when Humbert offers his apology for all his nastiness, and his admonition to Lolita, and the revelation that neither Lolita nor Humbert are alive as we read the book, and his pathetic summation...""I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita."" It ties everything together and completes the circle.Strengths:1. Acting - this was good by the 4 prime characters - Lolita (Sue Lyon), Humbert (James Mason), Charlotte (Shelley Winters)  and Quilty (Peter Sellers).2. Cinematography - nicely filmed, in black-and-white.This is a good movie - but it certainly is not Nabokov's ""Lolita"".",N/A
867162,"Angel, as a show, pretty much lost me in season four (see my less than enthusiastic review of that one for details.)  Season 5, however, won back my heart.The introduction of Spike was done so well that it shouldn't be considered ""jumping the shark.""  All the hows & whys of his post-post mortem reappearance were answered in such a way that it actually strengthened the season-long arc.  They could have very easily just said ""oooh, it was magic"" but they didn't.  The writers carefully wrote a back story and even brought back Mr. Urban Cowboy himself (Lindsey) and even suggested that W&H; wanted Angel (not Spike) to die in the hellmouth and then be connected to W&H...but; Buffy unwittingly threw a monkey wrench in those plans.The first part of the season mainly deals with creatrues-of-the-week, most of whom are W&H; clients, and the Angel Gang's transistion from their previous roles to their new one, that of working for good inside the belly of the beast.  The Angel/Spike rivalry is also explored in more depth, with ""Destiny"" being one of the best episodes in the history of the Buffyverse.  Another episode, ""Damage,"" explores the consequences of Buffy's actions at the end of that series in a tasteful yet disturbing manner.The season, and the show, really turned a corner with the 100th episode ""You're Welcome"" where Cordelia made a triumphant but brief return.  She was the true Cordy from season 3, not the vacuous and superficial teenager from Buffy nor the pawn of evil from Angel Season 4.  Her one appearance really helped direct the rest of the season towards its final conclusion, and the ending scene brought tears to my (usually unemotional) eyes.After that point, there is a little comic element, including a flashback to WWII with spike wearing a Nazi jacket (he wasn't a Nazi, he'd just eaten one and liked the jacket) and one of the most darkly humorous episodes in the history of television, ""Smile Time"" where Angel gets turned into a puppet.  The scenes where Nina the Werewolf attacks puppet Angel was absolutely hilarious and the one where puppet-Angel vamps out during a fight scene had me in stitches.After the humor comes turmoil, as we must bid farewell to Fred.  I don't know of any fan of the series who did not love Fred, and her death and subsequent metamorphosis into Illyria caused as much anguish amongst fans as it did amongst the characters.  Her death seemed to simultaneously eliminate the hope of a happy ending, while at the same time emphasize that the fight must go on.Towards the end of the season, the weekly plotlines are supplemented by subtle yet powerful indications that something big is about to go down.  Angel appears to become desensitized to evil (at least) or becoming a part of evil (at worst.)  The characters must come to terms with their actions and decisions over the past few years.In the midst of this, Connor returns.  Only he's not the annoying brat from a hell dimension he once was.  Now he's a normal, intelligent young man who still can't escape his destiny.  This year's Connor was actually more likable and quite a bit more attractive) when compared to the previous years.Probably the only non-great episode is the third to last, ""The Girl In Question"" when Angel & Spike go to Rome to save Buffy from and old enemy of theirs.  It just didn't work well, but the secondary plot with Illyria reverting to ""the Burkle persona"" was dark & disturbing.  What saves the episode are the flashback scenes, particularly when Drusilla & Darla go to take a bath together and Drusilla says ""is it time for another pony ride?""Character development was great in season 5.  Not a single member of the group remained unchanged (in the case of Fred, quite literally) but yet they stayed true to their core values and to fighting the good fight.The last two episodes were quite simply orgasmic.  Enough said.Favorite episodes: Destiny, Damage, You're Welcome, Smile Time, Not Fade Away.Most emotional: Destiny, A Hole in the World, Shells.Funniest episodes: Smile Time, The Girl in Question.",N/A
351920,"Sam Masterson left Iverstown with a traveling circus as a boy in 1928. 18 years later, having been everywhere and done his share of everything, including being a decorated war veteran, Sam (Van Heflin) finds himself back in Iverstown when he has car trouble as he is heading out West. He intends only to stay a day, and has the fortune to meet a young woman named Toni (Lizabeth Scott) whom he likes very much en route to his hotel. But when the town's first lady, Martha Ivers (Barbara Stanwyck) and her District Attorney husband, Walter (Kirk Douglas), who were childhood friends of Sam's, find out he is in town, they are immediately suspicious. Jealous over Martha's past affection for Sam and paranoid about his own political career, Walter assumes that Sam has come to stir up trouble concerning the untimely death of Martha's Aunt 18 years before. And Walter starts plotting against him.The film's title very nearly says it all. &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; is about just that: the nature of the affection that Martha has had for Sam since she was a girl and how it  influences her actions when she sees him again. The film was directed by Lewis Milestone on what looks like a substantial budget. &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; is a slicker production than is often associated with film noir. It was written by Robert Rossen, who adapted the screenplay from John Patrick's short story &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot;, as yet unpublished at the time the film was made. The incomparable Barbara Stanwyck once again proves herself to be the queen of noir. Martha Ivers is a complex, inscrutable, and ruthless character, whom Stanwyck plays to perfection. This is Kirk Douglas' first film role and one of his most memorable. Walter is alcoholic, racked with guilt, manipulative, ruthless, but very much in love with his domineering wife. Douglas' performance reveals Walter in all of his pathetic intricacy. Van Heflin is wonderful as the film's &quot;everyman&quot; fighting to survive in circumstances beyond his control. Sam reminds me of the protagonist in another wonderful classic film noir, &quot;D.O.A.&quot;. Both characters are victims of circumstance. But in this case, the situation is beyond Sam's control because he isn't aware that there is a situation. It 's the things you don't know that hurt you. I found &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; complex, sinister characters fascinating. It has just the right amount of gleeful cynicism. And I thoroughly enjoyed the film's unpredictability. It has become one of my favorite classic noirs, due in large part to its well-drawn villainous duo. I encourage fans of the genre to give it a try.The DVD (This refers to the Parade DVD only): Includes written bios of the cast, screenwriter, director, and composer of the film's score.

441293,"Even though the actors have cheesy 70's style clothes and hairdos the movies (especially The Night Strangler) don't seem too dated today. I admit they are brilliant films but equally so was the The Night Stalker series that followed. There is consistency between the two films and the tv series as Kolchak has self-describably gone from Las Vegas to Seattle to Chicago (where the tv show's set). Conrtrived that Tony Vincenzo (his editor) follows him in all three shows but why quibble over that flaw? But I wish in the tv show Kolchak's editor was, say, Sam Vincenzo, Tony's twin brother. Sorry, but I have to have to propose an alternate theory whenever I find fault with something.",The Night Strangler VHS
188713,"For those of us who grew up with him, watching John Denver so suddenly emerge onto the national stage as the huge talent he was is a memory savored and protected in these harsher times. I remember driving to graduate classes and hearing ""Annie's Song"" for the first time. it was quite an experience. I remember listening to ""Rocky Mountain High"" and how it affected me in terms of my growing appreciation for wild nature and the need for conservation. More than anything else, for me John still symbolizes that better part of our common human nature that those of us ragged,and hopefully ""gracefully aging"" counterculturists still associate with what personal enlightment and true education can do to transform this into a finer and more sustainable planet. Thus, this wonderful set of DVD (and also available CD recordings) that comprise the entire ""Wildlife Concert"" offering is a wonderous gift that reminds of of the immense range of talents and sensitivities he shared with us in his brief time on earth.Of course, you can rest assured that all of his famous songs are here, as well as a number of newer and less well known works, which are included as well. In the end, one is simply amazed at the freshness and novelty he is able to bring to bear in his presentation of many of the offerings here, in the wonderful way in which he performs some of these songs, singing lyrics he had sung thousands of times but seeming just as fresh and new as the first times he performed them. Like many artists, he doesn't necessarily stick to the familiar sound of the recorded version, and while that might annoy a few patrons who prefer the overly-familiar stamped-out record version, for me it is an indication of his great artistic prowess to able to do so this convincingly after all this time, and to do so with such aplomb, enthusiasm, and flavor. The comforting thing to understand is that at the time he had the concert, close to the time he died in the tragic airplane accident that abruptly ended his life, he seemed at the top of his form, regaining lost popularity, and ready to record new works in progress. This is a wonderful DVD, and one I recommend to all John Denver fans. Enjoy!",The Wildlife Concert

723981,"We now have our second 'The Twilight Zone - Collection' and we enjoyed it with the same anticipation and viewing as we did 'Collection 1.'One of the great aspects of viewing each collection, you never know which episodes will be paired. So part of the enjoyment is the 'I wonder what's next?'This collection includes two of the sixty minute episodes. They're like a mini-movie in their quality and production. Even the thirty mintue episodes have that quality. Serling never skimped on making these high quality productions and performances. As I said about 'Collection 1,' the actors Serling used became household names, actors who saw a quality part, and knew a good opportunity when they saw it.We're going to continue collecting these dvd's. From the packaging to the product itself, this is first rate film/television viewing. Serling deserves great credit in providing a product with such entertainment value and social significance.One of Serling's feature films, 'Patterns' follows in the footsteps of Twilight Zone. It's not on dvd as of yet, but I highly recommend it when it is made available. It's everything TZ was and more.",N/A
