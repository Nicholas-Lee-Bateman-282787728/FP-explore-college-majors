1180647,"The Hulk is more visceral that any other Comic character made onto the silver screen. His alter ego is played by the vulnerable Edward Norton, an excellent choice. The special effects are at times magnificent, convincingly in harmony with the real life cinematography. Liv Tyler plays a sensual, sympathetic girl friend and John Hurt delivers cold determination with the prophecy of redemption in his caring eyes. Some parts of this well filmed movie take place in beautiful Brazil. Overall, a good film.It is a film that unexpectedly turns its cultural attention, for a time, away from our shores, and to South America. I enjoyed the attempts at expanding its borders and giving a scale larger than its predecessors, and perhaps its comics. The boost is needed for a film that really, perhaps, shouldn't have been given another chance considering the hushed hype that this franchise has. Its fans, are no doubt, no less enthusiastic than say, Spider mans, but the numbers are surely lesser.But the Hulk, is a change in what we know to be superhero's. He is unstable, and unpredictable, and can you say that the green monster really is a good guy all the time? He is a beast, with mega strength, and an anger problem that is dangerous, and like a loaded gun, only needs to be pointed in a direction. If you happen to be standing in the way, you are in trouble. And for me, there isn't a classic nemesis to battle with the Hulk that has yet to catch our nations attention. We don't have, say, supermans Lex Luther. We have mutated poodles? That is lame.Hulk is presented in sometimes good CGI, but it never amazes as the title would lead you to think. It's editing is more impoved over Ang Lee's version, which did not stick to a winning formula. Here, the pull back a bit on the Comic page edits, and for a time tried to be more serious, like Christopher Nolans Batmans serious, but don't get me wrong, it never operates on the classic level of Nolan's Batman series.",N/A
977199,this is just like an extream when a stranger calls (much much better movie). the idea is really good but its low budget and not suspensful. i thought about turning this movie off twice. once in the very begining when you osee two little kids get stabbed and tied together (disturbing and sad) and in the end. people keep saying that its great to see the star get nude but you see her chest because she's tied up and seeing her friends get killed and the killer walkes over and opens her shirt and forces her boyfriend to basicaly assult her. the acting was really not good. the most i can give this not very suspensul and deffinatly not scary movie is two stars.,N/A

I only went ahead and bought this it while taking advantage of a great Amazon sale a few weeks ago in which I paid a very reasonable price for it. Fact is the episodes on this show are really flattened by the substraction of the classic music. The main title is specially ridiculous as the Happy Days theme has taken over ""Rock around the clock"" with the action cleary not matching the music. I wish the soundtrack hadn't been such a big part of the success of this show but by doing this Paramount has made that very clear.  The result is average at best.

630820,"Around the late 1950's and early `60's, Rock Hudson co-starred in a series of romantic comedies with Doris Day. ""McMillian and Wife"" is like those movies except for the crime solving element and with Susan Saint James in place of Doris Day. That would make Sargeant Enright (John Schuck) the Tony Randall in Rock's debut TV series. My reason for making my purchase is that ""McMillian and Wife"" has two things in it I really like to watch in a mystery series. One is humor with such things as congested traffic, a coffee machine and a water fountain. The other is being that since this show was made in the pre-CSI era, the violence is suggested. The idea someone has been murdered comes across without graphic details. This DVD set contains the pilot, ""Once Upon a Dead Man"" and the seven episodes of Season One that rotated with ""McCloud"" and ""Columbo"" on the ""NBC Sunday Mystery Movie"" in the 1970's.",McMillan & Wife: Season One
1174871,"Creating a magnificently filmed biographical epic of the rise of the great Genghis Khan is a daring adventure in film history. Although the film has the look of success, bringing the Khan to life is only partially realized. Part myth, part history, Genghis Kahn steadily rises to power, making bold battle decisions and faltering rarely. What is missing from this solid film is a core of passion. Too many scenes drag.Director Shinichiro Sawai wanted to be circumspect in telling the story of Temujin, who finally unites the Mongols to claim the title Genghis Khan. But in presenting Temujin as a man growing into leadership, Sawai has to evade some truths. The Temujin of this film, played by Takashi Sorimachi, is thoughtful and honorable, almost to a fault, a reputation at odds with the one of history.Toward the end of the film, Khan tells Kulan, his female soldier, that blood must be spilled to open borders, a seeming contradiction that is sensible to him. Indeed, having a whole world without borders is perhaps a euphemism for total world domination. Another omission from history is that the Khan left his DNA all over Asia and Europe yet none of this is part of the story. In fact, the movie implies that Temujin is faithful to the one wife. It's little telling points like these that make the film less effective. Having a hero without warts is terribly unrealistic and unreasonable.The film is episodic in nature, presenting key moments in Temujin's life, showing what manner of man he is all along his life's journey. Unusually kind and considerate toward his women, Temujin, in fact, reveals a major life issue: whether he is truly a child of his father and the great blue wolf or if he is blood issue from a warring tribe, of which one member took his mother to wife for a while.History repeats itself when his own wife is abducted and recaptured by Temujin, only to discover she is pregnant. Is this baby his or the child of the enemy? When he captures the girl soldier, she insists on death rather than be taken as a spoil of war. Temujin shows his magnaminity by allowing her to become one of his soldiers, then later she invites him to take her as concubine. The director chooses to depict Temujin as an equal rights proponent when history would most likely dispute this.His loyalty to his childhood friend is the most telling episode of Temujin's character. The final scene between them is painfully slow, again to reveal the inner turmoil that Temujin feels.The longest drawn out scene is the naming of Temujin as the great Genghis Khan, a scene that went on and on and on. In contrast, the final scene is the impending attack upon the Great Wall of China and the Jin Dynasty with the suggestion of extending the kingdom to the ends of the Earth and Sea.Even with the film's omissions and perhaps slight shifting of truth, ""Genghis Kan: To the ends of the Earth and Sea"" is a rewarding movie experience. The vistas of Mongolia alone are enough to see this epic film.",N/A
1100972,"Volume three of Gomer Pyle is certainly a delight and it never fails to disappoint.This season shows the series at its height.The team of Sutton and Nabors was a match made in heaven which improved as the series progressed.Sutton with his military but not always too bright demeanor, going against the thorn in his side the accident prone but all around good guy Gomer.Suttons' reactions to Gomers' faux pauxs(real or imagined) are priceless pieces of TV comedy and never fail to garner some good belly laughs.I have read others' complaints about the music being cut from the second season but I had not noticed any real time difference in any of those eps as they always were around the same time in length.But I must admit before season three came out(and he did some singing then,which is included)I thought that Nabors HAD done some singing in Season Two(maybe I was mistaken?).It is not understating it when I DO recall however,what a sensation this was for fans of the show back in the 60s.Indeed it brought to the attention of the country just what a singing talent Jim Nabors was,the total opposite of his character.And it launched for him a VERY successful second career.Much the same way Frank Fontaine had been launched into his successful singing career after playing Crazy Googenheim on the Jackie Gleason Show.Same situation,with Frank playing a goofy,drunk patron then stepping totally out of character to belt out a beautiful song with those magnificent pipes.Whatever the status of these eps as far as cutting goes,these third season eps are sure to please all fans of the series.All the same supporting players are back and with Gomer still running afowl of Sgt.Carters'""good graces"",with often hilarious results.All eps are transferred nicely in colour and are generally crisp and clean looking.This is Gomer Pyle at the height of its' game and the writing is still top notch.The main negative would be the lack of any special features in the set.Looking for a good,funny show the entire FAMILY can watch? This is for you.Grab it.Move it...move it...move it!",N/A

It is wonderful to own the series. What a fabulous show. They don't make that stuff anymore!",Frasier: Season 3
1042017,"Batgirl, that's what.I really did like the first season and I loved the second. So, I was really excited to see the third. I've never been a big fan of batman having a sidekick, but I did like the fact that they were bringing in Batgirl before Robin. That is something that's never been done before. The good stories are still there but the impact isn't. There are some very great episodes in this season too, probably better than any on the second, but there are also some that are just downright bad. Batgirl really did bring the show downhill, to me that is. Her dialogue is horrible, I know she is a kid, but it's almost like they keep trying to remind you with making her talk constantly. I will admit, about halfway through (The Laughing Cats), she did start to grow on me a little. She was starting to feel like she belonged. I guess the series just couldn't think of a better way to bring her in.I am also very very very tired of (I hate to say this) the Joker. His crimes in this season were horrible. I'm a huge Joker fan and loved the episodes he was in last season, but this time it seemed like they were just using him because he is the joker. The episode ""Brawn"" just seemed like it could have been a lot better if they would have just used Bane. We do need more of Bane, and I hope to see him later in the series. I was glad to see that they cut down on Penguin a little. Didn't like the first episode with him (A Knight to Remember) but I did like The Icy Depths a lot.I also liked the build up to Hugo Strange, and was very happy to finally see his character come out. I also did like the idea of someone going after Bruce Wayne.My Top 5 episodes were1. Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind- D.A.V.E was a great idea for a villain and to put Hugo behind it was even a better one2. A Fistful of Felt- A classic Ventriloquist story, with Strange pulling the strings.3. Thunder- The one episode that I did not mind Batgirl at all. Everything about this one just seemed right.4. RPM- A good story to introduce a new batmobile5. The Icy Depths- Even though I do not like this version of Freeze that much, he is in some pretty good episodes.So maybe after I watch this again, I might start to appreciate it more but at the time being this is how I feel about this season. Also please remember, these are my opinions and you may feel different. I would still recommend it for what good there is.",N/A

138290,"""City Slickers"" is a character-driven story, told with extreme charisma and truly funny, yet deep characters. It tells the tale of a man going through a mid-life crisis and how he deals with himself.  Billy Crystal is Mitch, the guy going through a depressing point in his life. Daniel Stern is his best buddy Phil, a worrywart who is owned by his wife. And Bruno Kirby is Ed, his other best friend who has a lust for younger women, and a lust for outrageous and crazy adventures. Such as the bull run in the beginning of the film, or his idea for a skydive.  Mitch starts to suffer greatly with his newfound mid-life crisis. Phil is caught having an affair with a grocery store clerk by his wife. Ed is...well...Ed. So on Mitch's 39th birthday, Ed and Phil reveal that they have bought Mitch a spot on a cattle run, and they're coming along, too. They'll be driving cattle just like real cowboys.  Mitch is unimpressed, but his wife insists he go to relieve stress. Mitch tries to get out of it by reminding her of his promise. ""I told you I was going to stay with your parents,"" he says. ""You hate my parents,"" she says.  So off Mitch, Phil and Ed go, out to a cattle ranch where they meet Curly (Jack Palance), a homicidal cowboy who freaks Mitch out. Laughter ensues. And after that, more laughter.  The cattle drive begins, and eventually things go hay-wire. Curly dies. The two other drunk leaders flee for their lives. Mitch, Phil and Ed are left with two fat ice cream inventors (a la Ben & Jerry), and an attractive woman who Mitch cannot get near because he is married. She says hello to him. ""I'm married,"" he replies.  I watched some of ""City Slickers"" about four years ago and wasn't too impressed. Perhaps it was because the TV version cut everything out. This time around I absolutely adored it, it is truly one of the best comedies of the last ten (now fifteen) years.  Billy Crystal is perfect as Mitch. I love his demeanor towards life, his grim outlook on things. Like the speech he gives to children in a kindergarten class. Priceless.  The entire cast is excellent, and only the last ten minutes of the film fell apart a bit, in which you get a quite typical ""I'm over it, I'm a hero"" moment where Mitch comes to terms with himself and almost drowns saving a calf, which makes him look more like a suicidal idiot rather than someone coming to terms with himself.  But the rest of the film is 100% excellent; funny is an understatement. The characters seem very real, something rare for a comedy these days. ""City Slickers"" is definitely one to see. If you still don't want to, I can only say one thing: ""Helloooooo?!""",N/A

1154951,"Brendan Fraser in ""Journey"" and in ""The Mummy"" is perfecting the role of the hero who is smart-dumb with a kind of a dizzy, dazed, sexy look. He's in action movies that have a light, bantering tone, but yet the stories have incredible creatures, scary chases, wild special effects, but a ""Look folks, no hands, only kidding"" kind of approach. This handsome, still boyish looking actor, manages to look terrified and can scream his head off in the face of danger. The character is bright, but you suspect there's a dumb streak lurking below the surface.He, a science prof, and his nephew, Josh Hutcheson playing Sean, go to Iceland where they join up with pretty Hannah, go climbing and end up falling to the center of the earth where there is a huge amount of space, plenty of light, a horizon, and apparently plenty of oxygen.Scary highlights: 1. Sean has to cross a deep chasm by jumping from one magnetic floating rock to another with one rock orbiting while he's clinging aboard. 2. Man-eating very toothy fish with real overbites attack the three on an elaborate raft that they were apparently to build in about a day without tools. 3. Prehistoric drooling monsters like raptors chase the uncle and nephew and almost gobble them up. 4. Huge, very hungry carnivorous plants attack Fraser and Hannah. Watch Fraser take care of the last plant, and you'll know why this is part braggadocio spoof.This is good escapist stuff that will entrance you as long as you don't start asking too many dumb questions. It's a thrilling adventure, scary and fun. Fraser is a winning action hero.",N/A
549504,"Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Decalogue"" is a series of ten short films set in a block of towering flats in modern Warsaw. Co-written by Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz for Polish television in the late 1980s, the ten one-hour-long episodes explore each of the Ten Commandments, although many of the Commandments actually overlap one another.The series is profoundly meditative, without being boring. The actors are remarkably believable, especially when Kieslowski relies on close-ups of the face; the soul of their character is practically laid bare. Very intimate. I was particularly struck by the guardian angel or witness - a young man (Artur Barcis) - who appears in eight of the episodes, just before a Commandment is broken.It's hard to say which episodes are the best. Each one projects a powerful moral message, forcing you to consider both sides of the issue and to realise these time-honoured laws have many ramifications in our daily lives, even today. My personal favourites include episodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10.Roger Ebert's commentary at the beginning is an excellent primer to those unfamiliar with Kieslowski and the synopsis behind ""Decalogue"", and I would recommend viewing it before the series.Lastly, one need not understand the Polish language or culture to appreciate ""Decalogue"". For that matter one need not come from a Judeo-Christian background. ""Decalogue"" is a film full of emotion and intelligence that can be universally understood and appreciated by all. Absolutely beautiful!!!I would also recommend Kieslowski'sThree Colors Trilogy (Blue / White / Red).",N/A

And I am surprised and pleased at the tribute to healthy values such as waiting, and not compromising with truth. On the other hand, the powers that be aren't above putting Teri in some skimpy and tight outfits.The recurring theme of season three is the continued struggle to have a normal relationship. Sometimes it seems that the supervillians are more set on destroying Lois and Clark's relationship than they are on stopping Superman.The series as a whole is definitely a different take on the old comic book story, but in a completely different way than Smallville.

1204441,"This show, which centers around an unexpected teen pregnancy, has some poignant moments that show the strength of friendship and family ties.  However, all-too-often, the secondary characters come off as cartoonish because of exaggerated behavior or responses, rather than as real people.  Molly Ringwald steps in the Mom's role but the writing for her character is flat and creates a somewhat whiny role for her. The biggest problems however, are the handling of the central issue of the pregnancy and the prevalence of teen sex.  The age group depicted (15 year olds) is unlikely the age group watching (pre-teens are probably the must see audience).  I'd hoped to find family viewing but all too often, even my teens and pre-teens were amazed at the over-the-top writing and situations.  So why three stars?  Mainly because my kids find the actress who plays the main character quite engaging and the most realistic character of the bunch and they love the bond that she shares with her sister.

I bought this Broadway version DVD several years ago and loved it. When the movie came out with Johnny Depp I went to see it immediately, hoping I would not be disappointed. I wasn't. The movie is so totally true to the show, it's wonderful. The music and lyrics keep playing through your head, and the dark humor stays with you for days. But the enticing thing is that the Broadway production manages to do it all on one stage with just minimal scenery being pulled and pushed about, where the movie had so many changes of scenery. Also, there is some additional music/singing that is in the Broadway production that isn't in the movie (which is totally understandable once you've seen both versions).

746851,"Wesley Willis: The Daddy of Rock 'n Roll (Daniel Bitton, 2003)Whatever you may think of the late Wesley Willis, the towering schizophrenic rock and roll disciple whose music evokes hero-worship among the few and looks of utter confusion among the many, there is one unarguable fact about him: never in the history of rock and roll has there been a less likely rock star than Wesley Willis. Here's a guy who stands six foot six, weighs well over three hundred pounds, and dresses in neon green sweat pants; if there is a defined rock-star look, that is certainly not it. And yet Wesley Willis' music embodies both everything good and everything bad about rock at the same time; it's simplistic to the point of brainlessness, it's repetitive, it's scurrilous and obscene and deeply, deeply funny. It points, at the same time, to the pioneers who have carved out niches in rock over the years and the brainlessness of the overprocessed radio-friendly crap that dominates the airwaves today. Despite this, Wesley Willis created music for which the term ""original"" would be an understatement. What better subject for a musical documentary?Filmmaker Daniel Bitton's hour-long Wesley Willis special is a ""day in the life"" kind of thing, following Willis around and staying out of the way, letting the man's words and actions speak for themselves. Willis is, in many ways, like any of us; he goes to Kinko's to use the computer to type out lyrics, much to the consternation of the other patrons (having a huge black guy suddenly say ""suck a baboon's dick with Heinz Ketchup!"" next to you is probably not the most reassuring thing that will happen to you on any given day), he goes to the studio and records a few tracks, he noodles with a synthesizer at home, he rides the bus, he talks to people, he sees his friends, he performs a concert, he goes to sleep. So, okay, that's probably not like most of us. And even for those of us it is like, you don't have friends like Steve Albini doing your engineering at the studio. But still, there's a comforting tranquility to all this. Here's a guy who's sold more albums than you ever will, and he's gotta use a bus pass just like everyone else.It should be obvious form the get-go that whether you like this movie or not will be inextricably tied to whether you like Wesley Willis or not. That said, I've seen some music documentaries that I've hated even when I love the band(s) in question. This is not one of those documentaries; if you like Wesley Willis, you'll like The Daddy of Rock 'n Roll. Rock over London. Rock on, Chicago. *** ",N/A

826791,"Unforgiven was pretty much an above average ppv. Most of the matches were as expected and they did a good job to put on a good performance for the show.1. Ric Flair & Batista vs. Chris Benoit & William RegalThis was a very good choice for an opener. I'd have to say this was way better than the tag team titles match that happened later on in the ppv. Batista was showing his unstoppable force he posesses. Flairs style & regal's meshed in pretty well with each other and so along did Benoit's. There were some hard knifehead chops delivered to Flair in this one. The ending was pulled off very nicely and it worked in well. A very solid opener. 4/52. Women's TitleTrish Stratus w/ Tomko vs. VictoriaThese two have had way better matches in the past but this was a decent women's match for the title. Tomko interfered at certain points in the match for trish. The ending felt a little off and uncalled for to me. Decent match between the divas. 3.25/5After the match, Tomko had a little miss up with a Mystery woman who turned out to be Stevie Richards. This little brawled shouldn't have lasted more than 5 minutes but this was totally a waste of time which lasted around 10 minutes or so. This could have been saved for Raw.3. Ladder Match for the Vacant Intercontinental TitleChris Jericho vs. ChristianJericho & Christian out did themselves in this ladder match. They showed us some pure athleticism and poise to everyone. It started out pretty slow and the ladders didn't come into play right away. It got better as the match went on. Both men took some nasty falls off the ladder and shots into the ladder. This is one ladder match that you won't forget after you see it. Another thing, this ladder match reminded me of the one from Wrestlemania X between HBK & Razor. A darn good ladder match. 5/54. No DisqualificationKane w/ Lita vs. Shawn MichaelsThis was a pretty good return match for HBK. Kane and HBK blended in pretty well. Kane took advantage of the no dq rule from time to time. Using the steel steps to open up HBK and suplexing him through the announce table. Michaels pulled some good counters to Kane. The ending was good as well and pulled off very cleanly. A good match. 4.5/55. World Tag Team TitlesRhyno & Tajiri vs. La ResistanceThis match really didn't get my attention at all that much. I felt it could have been better and there wasn't much leading up to the match for the fans to care about it. A decent match at best with a few good spots. 3/56. World Heavyweight TitleRandy Orton vs. Triple HThis was a good match for Orton to lose his title in. But of course Randy was only put as champion to erase Brock Lesnar for being the youngest champion in history. I enjoyed Randy as champion at this time, him and HHH had a great feud going on.The match was wrestled very strategically. HHH and Randy tryed to work on the leg of each other. Orton was more of the aggressor and not backing down from the game. I felt a lot of the interference took a great deal away from the match itself and many of it was uncalled for (such as the Coach coming out as the referee). It did had a couple of good spots like when HHH pedigreed orton into a steel chair. But the whole interference from Evolution really wasn't needed to be there. Still a solid, wrestled main event. 4.75/5Unforgiven is one to pick up from 2004. Probably the ladder match and the main event are the biggest reasons to get this.",WWE Unforgiven 2004

508675,"Psycho 3 was lousy and I agree that Psycho III was the weakest Psycho installment of them all and that Psycho II seemed to be where the Psycho installments stopped being good.As a matter of fact, PSYCHO III seemed to be somewhat like a repeat or a reliving of how the original Psycho was since Norman Bates(Tony Perkins) was just simply reliving his days as a schizophrenic posing as both himself and his dead mother killing customers at the Bates Motel again like he did in the original Psycho, except Psycho III was a lot less heart-pounding, a lot less suspenseful, a lot less mysterious, and a lot less genuine, which is what made PSYCHO 3 lag big time, but this movies predecessors(PSYCHO I and PSYCHO II) were a lot more superb and Anthony Perkins did a much better job at playing Norman Bates in PSYCHO's I and II, but didn't do so hot in PSYCHO 3.Therefore, the PSYCHO sequels seemed to have started losing their touch when it hit Psycho III, since it wasn't as mysterious or as blood curdling as the first two Psycho installations.  So the film makers should've done a better job at making PSYCHO III, because it's not worth the buy, unlike the original PSYCHO and PSYCHO II.In addition to that, PSYCHO 3 was obviously not the most shocking of them all, even though it quoted ""The Most Shocking Of Them All"" on the advertisements. it was Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho I that was the most shocking of them all as well as the original and still the best to this very day, even though I liked Psycho 2 the best out of the whole Psycho series.I also suspect that Psycho 3's reason for not being that great and for not being as genuine or a significant as the first 2 was perhaps due to the fact that Tony Perkins had directed Psycho III as well as being the main character in this movie, but I honestly don't think that Tony Perkins did nearly as much of a good job at directing this movie as opposed to directors Richard Franklin(Psycho 2) and Alfred Hitchcock(Psycho I).In addition to why Psycho 3 wasn't as good as the first 2 Psycho's; the music score done by Carter Burwell wasn't as good nor as creepy nor as intriguing as the music scoring done by Jerry Goldsmith in Psycho II and the music scoring done in Psycho I, although Carter Burwell's music scoring isn't too shabby in general, but Jerry Goldsmith is one of my favorite music composers when it comes to movies.",Psycho 3
1113731,"The first time I watched this film I didn't like it very much. It held my interest, but I didn't care for the wafer-thin plot. And those are diet wafers. But I watched it again with the audio commentary by writer/director Michael Davis. He pointed out some of the elements that I had missed, and my interest picked up.The jerry-rigged plot has Mr. Smith (ably portrayed by Clive Owen) injecting himself into a conspiracy to murder a very pregnant woman. Hordes of heavily armed bad guys are hunting her. Smith ends up caring for her newborn child. The movie becomes a series of gunfights in which some 130 (according to the commentary) bad guys fall to Smith's super-sharp shooting. The gun battles contain elements drawn from James Bond, Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, and the countless other flicks that feature a good guy who can shoot taking on legions of bad guys who can't. On top of this, Davis makes it all surreal by developing fantastic scenarios with a Rube Goldberg twist.The stunning Monica Bellucci adds a certain ... warmth as she plays a lactating prostitute who really cares. She proves with Mr.Smith that people can attain a satisfying climax under the most trying conditions. Paul Giamatti is the heavy (Hertz) who reminds me of Orson Welles gone to seed.There are some disgusting elements like a graphic depiction of what could happen when a gun falls into a filthy toilet and Hertz's ""interaction"" with a corpse.In my opinion, if you take away a few disgusting scenes and tighten up the plot, this becomes a great movie.",N/A

The movie is not only degrading to fat women but it also makes fun of just about anyone else. That wouldn't be problematic if it was done well, but unfortunately it is not.

His imaginative methods are revealed and discussed, as well as his impact on former students.I watched this DVD with a family circle of psychologists, all of whom were ravished by the ""developmental"" approach of the subject, Albert Collum. It was an enjoyable hour of watching, and an even more enjoyable discussion that the film provoked.I have serious doubts that Mr Collum's methods are exportable. As another reviewer with teaching experience has pointed out, Mr Collum was fortunately placed in a ""functional"" community. Here's my rap: good teaching results from good students, and good students result from good communities. I got confirmation of that opinion not long ago from Frank McCourt's book Teacher Man. McCourt was by his own account a lousy and unsuccessful teacher in challenged communities, but then became a creative comet in a privileged community.But hey, although I grew up entirely in challenged communities, I know I would have responded with joy to Collum's teaching. I wish I'd had the opportunity.I also have doubts whether Mr. Collum's methods of classroom management are reproduceable by anyone without his earnest charisma.

Until such time as good teachers can be cloned, I suspect to would be wise to treat them well, pay them well, and keep them in the classroom.",N/A
140871,"When rating a book or movie reviewers use many criteria, some of which aren't quite fair.  Personally I think books/movies should be rated on the basis of their intrinsic quality not as to how they are formatted or the quality of packaging.  That said, I'm about to disobey my own rule...slightly.'The Great Escape' is a great adventure tale and, on that basis deserves 5 stars.  I've rated it 4 stars, though, because the writers/producers/directors have altered the genuine tale to appeal to American viewers.  Yes, there was a real-life 'Great Escape' but there were no American participants.  The Stalag contained a mixture of Americans and Brits who planned the escape and prepared false papers,clothes, uniforms etc.  Unfortunately...or fortunately, depending on your point of view...the Americans were all transferred from the camp prior to the actual escape.  The escapees were Brits.  In most other details the story is correct.  Most of the prisoners were recaptured and some, without the knowledge of the prison commandant, were shot by the Gestapo.I heard some actual British survivors complaining about the movie in that it downplayed their own role.  They are perfectly correct...to put the Americans in the forefront, despite the fact that they didn't participate and no Americans were executed, is an affront to the brave Brits who actually attempted the escape.This is an issue for me, personally.  Do Americans 'require' stories written about themselves?  I took a chance and wrote two novels on the Conquest of Mexico--obviously there are no Americans.  The question is will English-speaking Americans be interested in this very Spanish and Aztec tale?Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",N/A

The story was originally supposed to follow Alan's personal struggle with becoming the thing he most hated, and Edgar's pain in losing his partner/brother. That was scrapped and thus all Alan's scenes were cut last minute.Luckily, there is a 4 piece comic out called 'The Reign of Frogs' which covers what plot elements occured between the two films.

1031126,"CrankThis film dared to answer the question of whether or not an action film would work if it only had action. This movie doesn't have much dialogue and a very simplistic story. Instead it focuses on delivering literally non-stop action through the entire movie with almost no stopping.The movie starts with Chev Chelios, your main character, watching a videotape revealing that he has been with injected with something and is going to die. In a fit of rage he begins his reign of terror. From that point on he begins his search for the men who poisoned him with what would become know through the movie as the Chinese ****. After a call to his doctor, Chev learns that the only way to slow his death is to keep his adrenaline flowing. If he slows down for anything he will begin to get dizzy and his vision will become distorted.The movie is amazing to watch. There are tons of gunfights, fighting, and car chases in this movie. When I say it's non-stop action, it really is. The movie stays different enough to keep it entertaining. You won't be watching fight scene after fight scene. Maybe you'll see him snort drugs off of the floor or have sex with his girlfriend on the side of the street. Anything he can do to keep his adrenaline up will work for him.The movie has a pretty simple story. There aren't many twists and turns. The way the story is done is well done with the combination of action and the fact that Chev is crazy and it is very humorous. I loved the way the ending was done.The extras are done in a very interesting way. It's called Cranked Out mode. You play through the movie with commentary and the movie will stop to show extras. This is a cool idea and keeps up the fast-paced idea of the movie.If you are a fan of action films then you have to pick this one up. Even if you aren't a fan of these films, you need to pick this one up. I can't give it five stars for being a bit too simplistic, but this is the closest to five stars as you can get.",N/A

The President of the USA, with his Secretary to Mutant Affairs who is not even informed, let alone associated, to the President's decisions on such a matter, has paid for the invention or devising of a special genetic vaccine to ""cure"" the mutants of their mutant-ness. This gives the opportunity to the bad mutants to gather some groups and even crowds and to start some terrorist action against this cure in the name that mutant-ness is not a disease. The final battle in order to destroy the research center that devised the ""cure"" and the scientist who is behind the discovery is spectacular with a bridge rotated in order to tie up San Francisco to Alcatraz by way of the Golden Gate Bridge. This time the battle will bring the bad mutants down once and for all.

If you haven't purchased it yet, avoid it like a petrified fruitcake.  I saw this film in 3D Imax and was so enchanted with the 3D effects that I couldn't wait for a 3D release of the DVD.  I was disappointed to see on the packaging that the 3D used the red/blue method which generally eliminates the color scheme of the movie right off the bat.  (I noticed that the 3D version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" which was released the same day came with the more modern polarized glasses with the neutral color.  I haven't seen that yet and can't comment on the success of that process with that particular DVD)What makes this presentation of the Polar Express in 3D such a failure is that THE GLASSES DON'T JOIN THE RED AND BLUE CHANNELS INTO ONE IMAGE.  Everything in the mid to foreground is seen in double vision which is extremely annoying.  We switched to the 2D version less than 5 minutes into the film because it was too disconcerting to see 2 chins...4 arms...etc.  Whoever made the decision to present the film in this manner should be fired for incompetence.The bottom line is that THE 3D EFFECT IS SO INCREDIBLY SLIGHT that it can't outweigh the major problems with the faulty technique.

948651,"After spending some time watching Dolph Lundgren movies and Jean-Claude Van Damme titles, it was nice returning to a Steven Seagal film - ""nice"" meaning, I could pop the ""Black Dawn"" DVD into my player and enjoy the film whilst dividing my attention with ironing laundry, because there's little chance that Steven was going to do or say anything to surprise me. Fans of his have generally accepted this, since the man has proven himself a guy of repetitious plots and characters. However, it wasn't before long I looked up from my towels to become aware of a couple of things regarding the movie: first of all, it's one of Seagal's prettiest DTV releases I've ever seen, and secondly, there's almost nothing going on in it.In a sequel to Seagal's maligned DTV-emerging flickThe Foreigner(proving that it's possible to expand the franchise of absolutely anything, no matter how bad it starts), he returns as ex-CIA mercenary Jonathan Cold, who is hired by British arms-dealers to help sell parts of a nuclear bomb to a group of Chechen terrorist-martyrs planning to blow up Los Angeles. But after plans go awry and CIA agent/former prot&eacute;g&eacute; Amanda Stuart (Tamara Davies,Scorcher) gets involved, Seagal must both flee assassination and stop the plot to destroy L.A.As said before, ""Black Dawn"" actually looks very good: award-winning lifetime cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski (Tremors) directs the movie with a decent flair for lighting and camera angles, so (with the exception of a couple of atrocious CGI-involving shots) the film manages to look like more than an $8 million production. Also in its favour is the cast, which is one of the better assemblies to be seen in a Seagal film: Tamara Davies and baddies John Pyper-Ferguson (Drive), Julian Stone (Loser), and Nicholas Davidoff play their roles convincingly, and the rest of the cast is clearly making an effort as well.I just wish that at some point, somebody had gone up to either Seagal or the director and reminded them that they were, in fact, supposed to be making an action movie. Much likeThe Patriot, ""Black Dawn"" offers little satisfaction for action-lovers. The cover of the movie is deceiving: next to no martial arts are displayed (and when the single scene does come, it features the worst-disguised body double Steven's ever had), and about two of the three gunfights featured last less than thirty seconds. A decent car chase involving a big rig is the adrenaline highlight, but without any other intriguing life-ending antics, this otherwise-pretty film feels inexcusably bare for a Seagal-starring feature. The plot lacks the intensity to qualify as a thriller and therefore, the movie is left both pretty and useless; no wonder writer Martin Wheeler has had trouble finding work.This non-action aspect slays the film as a whole: a Steven Seagal movie without action is like a hamburger without the beef pattie, and no amount of decent acting or cinematography can make up for it in the end. In this sense, ""Black Dawn"" is the most disappointing of Seagal's recent offerings, because it had so many things going for it that his other flicks didn't, but these were apparently traded for Seagal's bread-and-butter, leaving this otherwise-promising flick duly emaciated. For devoted fans, only.",Black Dawn
1124403,"If there has ever been an epic, There Will Be Blood is truly within the genre.  A sprawling tale about greed, it redefines the term 'drama.'  Daniel Day-LewisMy Left Foot (Special Edition)is simply brilliant as Daniel Plainview.  Plainview is a down and out silver miner who happens to strike oil in the turn of the century west.  With this new found fortune, he's able to buy up numerous ranches and farmland so he can continue drilling.  Along comes Paul (the underrated Paul Dano,Girl Next Door) a young man who tells Plainview (for a fee) of a place not so far away which has an ocean of oil beneath it.  When Plainview goes to research the land he meets Paul's twin Eli.  Eli helps to negotiate a fair price for his fathers land.  However, he asks the atheistic Plainview for a donation to help his church.  This is where the vengeance comes in.  Plainview is a stubborn man who won't take no for an answer.  He firmly believes that everyone and everything has its price.There Will Be Blood is a stunning piece of work.  P.T. AndersonMagnoliahas a true knack for creating fascinating stories with even more fascinating characters.  Throughout watching, I couldn't help but mentally compare it to one of many Stanley KubrickStanley Kubrick - Warner Home Video Directors Seriesfilms.  The music is haunting.  The scenery is breathtaking.  Plus the pacing is a simple work of art.  It's not the normal flick wherein a scene or shot lasts a mere thirty seconds.  Instead, each scene is a story within the entire story.  It's not made at a brisk, action-packed pace, but it certainly holds the interest of the audience.  To top it off, it has one of the greatest all time lines which is unexpected in an ""Oil Tycoon"" film. ""I drink your milkshake.""  Now I'm thirsty for milk and ice cream.",There Will Be Blood

521834,"After the success of the first Godfather picture, Francis Ford Coppola could do anything he wanted.  He chose a very loose adaptation from the leading character and basic scenario of Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-up, to create this both exciting and provocative thriller about a surveillance specialist who finds himself involved in a murder plot.In Blow-up, a fashion photographer takes a picture in the park and comes to believe that he may have evidence of a murder.  The difficulty is that the visual evidence is not conclusive -- it demands interpretation and no amount of manipulation can overcome the ambiguity of the image.  Here, Harry Caul uses elaborate techniques to record and collect fragments from what seems to be an innocuous conversation, but that he begins to suspect will be used in a murder plot.Just as Blow-up became not only a film about a photographer and a murderer but also a meditation on vision and on the cinema -- so The Conversation is a rich and sophisticated film about the nature of sound and the interpretation of sound and in particular about the way in which sound is captured for film.  Apart from having an excellent jazz soundtrack, the film is very subtle in its sound editing.It opens on a crowded park, and we immediately become aware that the sound of the crowds and the music and the individual people and the cars is recorded sound.  We hear the subtle distortions that come from blowing up sound recorded from a distance, and that in a finished soundtrack would be removed.  It turns out we are both watching the crowd and watching and listening in as a couple in the crowd is being recorded through a number of highly specialized surveillance techniques.  Later in the film, we are reminded at several points and in several ways that the sound in a film is an artificial construction and that it is independent of the visuals.  Some scenes that initially seem like they are part of the normal exegesis of the film, turn out to be reconstructions based on how certain characters heard and interpreted recorded sound; in other scenes the aural artifacts we have become familiar with show up to indicate that we can never be sure whether the sound is just part of the film or whether it is being recorded by a third party.This is an excellent film on a number of levels, as a political thriller, as a portrait of a paranoid individual, but also as a meditation on the nature of sound in film.  Definitely one to watch ... and listen to.",The Conversation

291934,I have never seen Metropolis before but this genre of old classic films really intrigue me especially the silent films.  I saw all the reviews of Metropolis and figured it might be worth a see.  This company Kino always deliveries quality in their movies and as I watched this one I was happy to see a nice picture without a bunch of distortion or fuzz.  The audio is 5.1 surround sound and it sounds great.  The music is very good and it really captures the mood of whats going on.I don't know what the original was like but I am very happy with what I saw and heard.  Like I said this is my 1st time seeing this so I don't know whats missing or what versions are available or whatever.  Most movies from the silent era never really grab me as much as this film did.  What is going on onscreen really captivated me and I was amazed at the time it came out and what it had accomplished.  For being such an old movie it was still enjoyable for me to watch today so I know it will be a classic favorite in my collection.  The subtitles when active give a somewhat glimpse of whats trying to be conveyed and some stuff I would never of thought of like seeing doors shut behind people as a relevance to something.  The subtitles are very helpful if you have no idea of what you are watching or even if you do the insights are still a very nice extra.Though the special features are a little light it does give a little insight into the restoring process.  There is also a documentary that goes into the German film industry at that time and scenes that were left out.  These extra features though kind of short but still were interesting to watch.Odds are if you don't like silent films or films that require a open mind to whats going on or even a respect for the time period you probably won't like it at all.  There is a lot of weird imagery going on so you kind of have to think sometimes about what is happening and if it has some other meaning.  I found the subtitles to help in this regard.  Overall I know some people would not have patience for a silent movie nor care for them but I have a great respect for older films and when I find one that I enjoy I know its worth my five star rating.  Everyone should see it at least once either for love or hate.,Metropolis Moroder version  VHS

1128571,"""Gone Baby Gone"" is a well-crafted piece of cinema which does credit to the directorial talent of Ben Affleck.  I will be the first to say I was surprised at the deftness with which he orchestrated the entire cast.I was, however, unable to make out what Casey Affleck, Ben's brother in the lead role of Patrick Kenzie, was saying 80% of the time.  I had to give up and use the subtitles after the first twenty minutes passed.  His massacred vocal intonations sounded like they were coming from underwater--and from an oral cavity stuffed with several dozen ball bearings.Still, despite his inconveniently inarticulate manner of talking, Kenzie's character was well-drawn overall.  One could easily believe this ""old soul"" in a young body was actually committed to behaving honorably and nobly in a plotline jammed with deceitful and dishonest individuals.  However, I am certain that in ""real"" life he would have been stabbed, shot, pushed into a quarry gorge, run over, and/or (at the very least) pistol-whipped by any number of the low-lifes Kenzie encountered in the course of the plot.  But the canny Mr. Kenzie slips past them all with only a brief interlude of actual mano-a-mano action (and of course he strides away from it, utterly unscathed and gloriously vindicated).Michelle Monaghan's Angie Gennaro was banal and insipid.  Whining early on that she ""didn't want to find a dead little girl's body"" struck a particularly incongruous note--she and her boyfriend/business partner were investigating A KIDNAPPING.  It would have been highly unlikely they were going to locate Amanda hosting a covert tea party in a local park with several of her favorite dolls.  And the very end of the film--when Patrick has to make what can only be described as a monstrously difficult moral decision--her words of ""support"" are ""If you do this I will hate you"".Fun.  Her entire presence in this movie was completely unnecessary.  Or perhaps if an actress with more potential had played the role, she wouldn't have come across as so completely unlikeable and bothersome.  And what was up with the feathered Farrah Fawcett hair Angie was sporting?  This wasn't a period piece set in 1982...The REAL breakaway talent of ""Gone"" was Amy Ryan, who took on the role of Helene McCready, mother of the missing girl. Helene is a trashy, self-centered, drug-addled disaster, and Amy plays the role with a brilliant honesty which has the viewer alternately loathing her severe deficiencies as a mother and a human being in general and simply pitying her self-destructive lifestyle.  Her performance is nothing short of Oscar-worthy!",N/A

A high caliber cast of actors served to entice me to watch this DVD.When we bred flesh eating monsters in our own backyard what can we expect? This is so unreal.

56092,"We see Carlito's traumatic fate at the very beginning of the film, but how does one who so ambitiously wants to leave the former gangster life in the past and move on with himself still manage to end up here.  This is the tale, and what a story it is.  Al Pacino gives a memorable performance, and Sean Penn is right there behind him.  Carlito (Pacino) is released after 5 years for a 30 year sentence from the help of his lawyer and best friend (Penn).  Carlito has been given the opportunity to own a piece of a nightclub, where he can progressively earn enough money to get the amount he needs to get away to the Bahamas, once and for all, where there he can live out a simple dream and leave the past behind.  From the near get-go, the kind heart of Carlito can't say no to his young cousin when he is asked to stay by his side during a deal.  The deal goes wrong and Carlito is already finding himself back in old times, but refuses to keep his dreams from not succeeding.  One after another, old pals re-apear, but it's the story behind the Sean Penn character that gets things really going, and when Carlito is reunited with his old flame (Penelope Ann Miller) the story becomes intense, suspensful, engaging and never ever lets up.  For the first hour, the movie is at its slowest (though never boring) and then shoots into high gear then on out.  Thankfully, the fire never loses its fuel, as this is one of those films that happily gets better and better until a very exciting, very suspenseful chase scene climax.  Just when you think the height of the excitement and story has been reached, there's still more on it's way.  Carlito's Way is a fantastic film that is sad in a sense, but states a sad truth.

First, I have not followed the 10 hints in the DVD cover, if indeed the 10 hints are anything but another Lynch spoof. The film must be approached via what Theodor Reik called 'listening with the third ear' (or seeing with the third eye), registering first impressions. Logic won't work, this is more like looking for clues for a rare disease, or trying to discover whether a painting is a fake. The first impression was that I was reminded of 'Persona'. The second thing, represented by the garbage can event, is that dreams are reality here. But what about the older cracked pair at the airport, who were they? Did Dianne use her aunt's money to pay the old guy in the wheelchair to make sure that she was in the film? The 3rd thing is the message of 'Silencio', that the tape/dream keeps running even if the person performing quits playing. So I think Camilla 'dreamed' the whole affair up until she opened the box, at which point 'Betty' disappeared and the tape quit, especially since they both saw 'Betty' as Dianne dead in bed earlier.

1004969,"Sharpe's Challenge Worthy ReturnBy Kristin BattestellaAfter a ten year break, the BBC returned to its Napoleonic series Sharpe in 2006 with Sharpe's Challenge. Based on the novels by Bernard Cornwell, this special two part episode is slim on premise but big on action and exotic locales.Five years after Waterloo, Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean) is now alone on his farm in Normandy after his French lover's death. He is suddenly summoned to England by Lord Wellington (Hugh Fraser), and at first declines the chance to put down an uprising in India. Wellington's first agent in India, horse trader Patrick Harper (Daragh O'Malley), however, has gone missing. Sharpe finds Harper once he reaches India, and together they must rescue damsels in distress and overthrow corrupt Indian warlords.Sharpe's Challenge is an awkward tale to summarize. On one hand its moving forward, taking place after Waterloo, but it is a composite of Cornwall's early Sharpe novels Tiger, Triumph, and Fortress. This mix of the two time periods automatically sets Challenge up for conflicting story points and even anger from die hard fans. If Sharpe's lover Lucille is dead, long time writer Russell Lewis and director Tom Clegg have erased two of Sharpe's children. Oops. Now that I've gone back to read Sharpe's Tiger I can see where pieces have appeared in Challenge. Its strange to read about Private Sharpe under Sergeant Hakeswill in Tiger when Challenge merely gives us a briefly red coated and pony tailed Bean. Could the powers that be have made a full length trilogy with some new young folk as Sharpe? Bean is no spring chicken, but in this day of reimagings and remakes I'm glad the production has stuck with its fans.Challenge brings back all of our old Sharpe favorites. It's great that everyone was willing to come back and storylines were made to accommodate Wellington, the decrepit Simmerson (Michael Cochrane), even Ramona. There's a few snafus regarding characters who were killed earlier in the series that are somehow alive and well here, and Sergeant Bickerstaff is clearly a poor man's Hakeswill. Sean Bean however, is on form, and the reunion with Daragh O'Malley makes Challenge. The guest stars for Sharpe's Challenge seem more high end than the series of old. Padme Lakshmi (Now of Top Chef who I knew from her dreadful guest spot on Enterprise) is perfectly cast as the icy and exotic Madhuvanthi. I did however expect more from Toby Stephens (Robin Hood, Die Another Day) He just grimaces and pursues his lips a lot and says kinky things. I imagine some British gals find this very pretty, but we've seen better, uglier and nastier villains in Sharpe.Challenge does give us something we haven't seen in Sharpe before: India. Despite the story's confusions, India was by far the best move for Challenge and future Sharpe productions. Some of the battles seem dusty and small scale, almost like the first film Sharpe's Rifles where the logistics were still being figured out. On the whole, however, the cultural changes, use of native scenery, historical sites, and local extras give Challenge an extra flair. I'm not sure how accurate the ladies' costumes are to the period, but they are very bright in what has been a somewhat dark and drab series. And they show some skin, always important for male viewers! At last it seems that technology has finally caught up to the fun stories and action Sharpe has told. Challenge looks so big, bright, and epic. I'm glad this episode is longer than the previous ninety minute installments. The look and excitement of Challenge tell us there's still fuel left in Sharpe's engine.And shocker of shockers what does my Sharpe's Challenge DVD have? Extras, by golly I kid you not! Although the behind the scenes feature has a silly, aloof focus on an Indian extra's quest to meet Sean Bean, these long awaited insights into the Sharpe series are more than welcome. Fight choreography, interviews with Cornwell and the cast, humorous on set moments. Not all of it is stellar material, but after fourteen Sharpe movies with no extras, I'll take it! What else am I loving on my Sharpe's Challenge DVD? The bloopers? The photo gallery? No, the subtitles!Sharpe's Challenge is a must for Sean Bean fans and Sharpe collectors. You're complete collection is now incomplete without it. Challenge may not be perfect, but the spirit of Sharpe is alive and well here. A new telefilm, Sharpe's Peril, is airing across the pond soon. Is Sharpe's Challenge the introductory film to a new Sharpe series? I hope so!",Sharpe's Challenge

Both films use subtle sound cues (as well as sound cues that hit you right over the head!) and both Hilligoss and Corinne Marchand play musicians (Michel Legrand's churning, relentless score is all over the place, Marchand mouthing several numbers).  As Cleo traipses through the boulevards, she comes across some pretty freakish sights that have been little commented on when people speak of Cleo's ""charm"" and ""wit,"" as if to prove that flaneurs don't necessarily enjoy a Maurice Chevalier experience of life, not when they're delirious and that elegant b/w photography goes all Weegee on a person.  Cleo's trying to keep it together when she sees the man who swallows frogs--big live frogs, one after the other, as the camera stares at him, hypnotized as she is.  He's shown as the peasant type, the guy from the countryside whose class is so low he has made himself into a freak for public consumption.  You wonder how he gets so many of those frogs down, it's totally disgusting.  Then he performs the money shot: tipping slightly at the waist, he evacuates them all in a solid spray of projectile vomit, white and greenish like the cold waves lapping at the fishermen's boots in Victor Hugo's TOILERS OF THE SEA.  Cleo puts a fist over her own mouth and her eyelids flutter close.  I haven't seen anything as freakish since season one of 30 Rock, the episode where Tracy Jordan is impersonating Star Jones on TGS with Tracy Jordan, stuffing his/her face with a thousand forbidden treats then throwing them all up like a vertical geyser across the studio kitchen, while Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin look on in what I now understand to be a subtle homage to Varda's nightmarish vision.The other disturbing scene in CLEO occurs in a different neighborhood a few reels later, but Cleo's still reeling herself!  There's a man running up to her proffering his bare forearm, through which he's worked what looks like two or three yards of waxed fishing line, which he pulls in and out of the suppurating flesh.  It's like a burst of grand guignol still extant in the pop 1960s Cleo lives in, and again, she freaks out, -- anybody would.  It's bad enough when you're walking around Paris and a flasher opens his raincoat, but these men are anticipating the body modification movement of the 1980s and it's uncanny.",N/A
657473,"Although I'm a fan of Richard Matheson's work, I have yet to read his novel, I AM LEGEND.I also haven't seen the first movie version with Vincent Price called THE LAST MAN ON EARTH.  I saw the cult favorite THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston years and years ago but I think I'll read the book and then watch that one again.  And maybe this one again.This third version, thankfully keeping Matheson's great title, is well-made and entertaining but I thought the first half was stronger than the second half.  I liked Will Smith in I, ROBOT and he does a great job here as well, playing a dogged scientist hunting in an eerily empty New York City by day and searching for a cure to the plague virus by night.  (Years ago it had been announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would play in this--imagine Dr. Arnold as a gov't scientist!)The zombie/vampires were creepy enough but they were obviously computer generated.  I wished there had been more personality given to them and more personal conflict between Smith and the monsters (a relationship between the lead monster and a female monster Smith abducts to experiment on is hinted at but never developed any further).Still, some great shots of NYC standing empty, overrun by weeds and deer.(Now I'll have to read the novel.  Without knowing the original story, I liked this movie version).",I Am Legend

On cardio day, I'd do the Speed Interval training on my rebounder so it would be easier on my knees and on strength training day, I'd do the Advanced Abs followed by the Muscle Toning routine. I use the warm up portion from this DVD and I just add a little more stretching on my own at the end. The Muscle Toning part where you'd have your arms above your head while doing squats for 90 seconds was VERY challenging. During the first round, I had 5 lb dumbbells on each hand and I almost didn't finish it so the second time around, I used 3 lb dumbbells and I was breathing hard after 90 seconds. I'd be sore the next day or 2 after doing this routine...Highly recommend this DVD. It's short but very effective in my opinion.",The Abs Diet Workout 2
93484,"David Fincher is probably one of the greatest directors we have working today.  He has a distinct style and presence with each of his films that goes unmatched by anyone else in the business.  Even his weaker fare like `Panic Room' still has such sharp and masterful texture to it; you can't help but admire his talent.  `Se7en' most definitely is his finest film; a true testament to his marvelous gift.  Hailed as the greatest crime thriller since `The Silence of the Lamb', `Se7en' may very well be the greatest crime thriller period.  Fincher touch elevates this gritty and quite disturbing picture even past the likes of `...Silence...' and creates something never before seen or experienced.  `Se7en' digs deep beneath the skin and festers.In `Se7en' Fincher takes us into the heart of sin; deadly sin for that matter.  The film focuses on two detectives, Mills and Somerset, as they track down a serial killer stalking their city.  Somerset is about to retire while Mills is going to be his replacement.  The two of them don't necessarily see eye-to-eye on the outset, but their involvement in the case brings them closer together.  The killer, who for the most part remains out of sight, strings along these detectives in an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse, leading up to the most shocking of conclusions in cinematic history (yes, the ending is a real mind-blower).As the films title would suggest, this `killer' strikes those involved in one of the seven deadly sins, namely gluttony, greed, lust, envy, sloth, wrath and vanity.  This premise leads for some extremely creative, not to mention spine chilling, crime scenes put on film.The benefit to such an intricate and perverse premise is that it allows morality to have a role in the growth of the film.  As the killer strikes time and time again we see the filth of society being victimized; the same type of individuals that do their fare share of victimizing.  The motives and views of the killer are made to take front and center as he expresses his `faith' in savage ways.  `Se7en' is smart enough to give the audience a reason to be truly scared.  Rather than having a lunatic randomly stalking and murdering hot young girls, Fincher and crew have created a killer who has a distinct target, a target that incorporates each and every living breathing human.We all sin; don't we?One thing that impressed me from the very beginning was the creativity and originality that went into the script.  The film is very fresh, especially when you consider the recycled garbage that gets passed around in this particular film genre these days.  It seems that each and every `horror' director out there wants to use the same clich&eacute;d sequences within their films to try and elicit some sort of fearful reaction from the audience.  Not so with `Se7en'.  Fincher has masterfully crafted a film that uses its head; that creates a mood and seeps slowly yet savagely into the viewers mind and starts to pick away at their sanity from the inside out.That mood is perfectly matched by the brilliant performances captured on screen.  Morgan Freeman delivers a very controlled and mannered performance as the wise Detective Somerset.  His performance is complemented beautifully by Brad Pitt's effortless portrayal of the gruff Detective Mills.  Pitt, who is often considered a pretty boy, really digs down and draws out perfection from this character.  Pitt, like DiCaprio, is one of those actors cursed by the pretty stick, but he has equally proven himself a dedicated and talented actor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as Mill's doting wife Tracy; but it is one other man who really steals the show.  Kevin Spacey has never been better in my humble opinion.  As `John Doe' he fleshes out pure terror.  His final frames are those `hold your breath' frames, where time stops and blood runs cold and everything around you begins to crush inward.`Se7en', as you can tell, is one of my favorite films.  The quote-unquote `horror' genre all too often suffers from unoriginality and a total lack of imagination.  `Se7en' is the supreme antidote.  It is gritty, disturbing and haunting to the core.  Quote honestly, if you are looking for an effective crime thriller then there is no better place to go.",Seven
1118074,"I don't give five stars very often, but this movie deserves every one. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are top-notch in this film, as are the other actors, the directing, the cinematography, and the incredibly excellent script.The basic story: Two men meet in a hospital room as they are being treated for cancer. They both find out the same day that they only have six months to a year to live. They make a list of things they want to do before they die, and set out to do them. In the process, the true gold in this film is illuminated. It isn't in the things the two men do, but is in the developing relationship between the two men, and especially what happens with Jack Nicholson's character. There is even a touch of the mystical that sneaks up on you at the end.I won't say any more, because I don't want to spoil anything. Just see the movie. Though it isn't one you can get up and walk away from to get a snack. Everything is needed in this film to tell the story. And again, I cannot state strongly enough how incredibly excellent the script is. The dialog is wonderful without ever striking a false note. The story is completely believable, and never once do you think that something isn't plausible, or that something doesn't sit right.I was a bit worried that this movie would be maudlin and/or depressing and/or incredibly sad, but it isn't. This movie is instead an affirmation of life.There are laugh-out-loud moments (again, fabulously excellent dialog!), and there are some moments when I cried--sometimes not because something bad happened, but because something wonderful did. I am very happy I saw this movie, and hope you will be too.",The Bucket List
1098579,"I had been hearing about Fido now for a year, the theatre in our town didn't carry this movie, so I have had to wait. Just hearing the premise: Stardust makes the dead walk and a zombie war happens, a scientist (who is rumored to have had his wife turn zombie) invents a collar that enslaves the undead and the world is right again, years later the Robinson family buys its very own zombie (Fido) and it kills the mean next door neighbor, can the boy save Fido from true death? I mean how can a zombie lover resist that?First of all it's a beautifully shot film, Gorgeous in Technicolor, you can really tell that the producers, directors, make up artists and especially set decorators thought every single detail out. The child, Timmy, even has a ""zombie"" war themed room complete with sheets and curtains. The zombies aren't too gross, because what family wants a rotting slimy zombie serving them martini's and washing their cars? They are scary enough though, to invoke that inner feeling of ""any minute they are going to bite someone."" Zomcom is the company that makes the collars, and they patrol the towns to make sure no ""rogue"" zombie infiltrates the nice 50's style neighborhoods. I guess that there isn't many rules as to what you can do with or to your zombie, because Timmy's neighbor and his ""Tammy"" are really, really, close. I love how he explains that he was in the grocery store when she had a brain aneurism and they had a collar on her ""before she hit the floor"" so she is ""barely decomposed"".Fido is played by Billy Connelly, who I have known from White Oleander and Lemony Snickets, and although he has NO speaking parts the man steals this whole movie with just his facial expressions. No zombie has enraptured and endeared me like this since Bub in Day of the Dead. The story is a classic one, a boy and his ""dog"", growing up in a society where you don't understand why some people have more advantages than other. It's also a story of how a dead man has more emotional depth and becomes more of a father and husband, than a real live one. It's about society's obsession with death, and how you can lose your family if you hang on to the ghosts of the past.This movie is the best I have seen in awhile, it won so many awards (in Canada) and got barely an article here in the states and that is a shame. Yes it's a zombie movie, but it's a beautiful, well written, superbly acted film that I could not recommend enough.",Fido

722527,"Due South, the only Canadian TV show that aired on U.S. PrimeTime television, came and went without most of us knowing about it.  But this quirky series not only provided a cop show with interesting plot lines, it fed us characters that were likable and wonderful to watch interacting.  Fraser, the RCMP Mounty, is an invariably polite, unfailingly non-violent (to the extent possible) liason to the Chicago police department's wise-cracking bad attitude italian cop Ray.  What makes it truly intriguing is that most of the time, Ray gets himself into difficulty with his bad attitude and matching verbal banter, while Fraser's open, friendly politeness succeeds in getting the desired results.  A really good family show that teaches younger members of the family (for example, our ten-year-old grandson) the benefits of being nice and polite instead of violent and angry.  Fraser's deaf but lip-reading dog, Diefenbaker, gives you some idea of how seriously the show takes itself.  I enjoyed every minute.",Due South : Season 1

The animation style is unique, but there are many glitches and often the animation quality dips when the view is farther away.The ending is the worst of the show, without giving anything away, watch Wolf's Rain or Ergo Proxy, the endings are similar but MUCH better.  The writing bogs down in many areas.I was intrigued after the first few episodes but the story just falls apart from the second disc onward.  We see a bunch of angst ridden children attempting to discover their heritage.  More often, the children sit around fuming.

The problem is that there's forty minutes or so in the middle that is sorta draggy. It isn't wasted time or anything, but maybe shoul have been paced better.Still, 'Billy' is genuinely scary.

1147026,"After a  shaky Season Five, the magic is back on track for a delightful  and enchanting Season Six of ""Bewitched."" Dick York was in terrible physical pain throughout his five year run; and he just couldn't continue on the show anymore. It is sad, but it is a fact, people. I wish ""fans"" would show Dick Sargent more respect. Dick Sargent did a wonderful job as well; and the show DID NOT ""jump the broomstick"" when Sargent took over the role of Darrin.  Does anyone else notice how ATTRACTIVE Dick Sargent is? He and Elizabeth Montgomery developed their own special chemistry and formed a wonderful friendship that lasted until Sargent's death in 1994. Sadly, Elizabeth Montgomery died in 1995.I'm not going  to get into the ""Dick York Vs. Dick Sargent"" debate; which  I've always regarded as pointless and stupid. I'll just say that Dick York as Darrin always seemed to me to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown because of Samantha's witchcraft, while Dick Sargent was exasperated by it. The transition between the two actors was handeled so subtly and smoothly as to be almost inperceptible.  The series picks up exactly where it was. Towards the end of Season 5, Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery)  tells an absent Darrin over the phone that she is pregnant in ""Samantha's Good News."" At the beginning of the Season Six Opener, ""Samantha & The Beanstalk,"" Samantha is painting a crib, asking Darrin what they should name the new baby. Feeling unwanted, Tabitha (Erin Murphy) switches places with fairy tale's Jack (""Family Affair's Johnny Whittaker) and Samantha climbs up the beanstalk after her.Although a few plots are ""recycled"" ideas, that is actually a common practice on any long-running Series, and few shows remain as endearing or enduring as ""Bewitched."" (the 30 episodes of Season Six are Episodes #171-#200 in the Series). The excellent ""Bewitched"" writers deserve kudos and praise for keeping the basic premise so fresh and fun throughout numerous and varied production changes. The  Series quality and creativity remained high throughout Season Seven.  As another reviewer so astutely pointed out, boredom  DID NOT set in until Season Eight, the final season. But there is  no need to jump ahead or despair here.Season Six is especially busy and fun. Alice Ghostley (who guest-starred as maid Naomi in ""Maid To Order"" in Season Two) joins the cast as maid Esmeralda, a shy, slightly neurotic witch who keeps fading in and out. Marion Lorne, who portrayed the beloved Aunt Clara, died at the end of Season Four. Producers wanted a new character who would also ""mess up the magic"" as Clara had done-- hence, Esmeralda was created. In ""Samantha's Curious Cravings"", a very pregnant Samantha magically receives any food she thinks about. When Dr. Bombay (Bernard Fox) attempts to remedy the situation, Samantha disappears whenever she thinks about food, and ""pops over"" to wherever the food is. In a related episode, the outstanding and hilarious ""Samantha's Lost Weekend,"" Samantha accidentally drinks a glass of ""magic"" milk, and can't stop eating! I always wondered if Elizabeth Montgomery had fun filming this particular episode-- because it certainly is great fun to watch! Baby Adam is born, leading to more feelings of rejection by Tabitha; which is the plot of another memorable episode titled ""Tabitha's Very Own Samantha.""Besides Jack & The Beanstalk, other ""house guests"" in Season Six include Julius Ceasar, The Artful Dodger, Mother Goose, and Santa Claus! After two previous visits to the North Pole, Santa (Ronald Long) and all of his Elves are stranded at Samantha and Darrin's house! Henry Gibson makes a memorable guest appearance as a mischievous leprechaun sent by Endora (Agnes Moorehead) to wreck havoc in the episode ""If The Shoe Pinches."" Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde), Daddy Maurice (Maurice Evans) and wild Cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery's other delicious Series role) also add to the fun and merriment of Season Six. After all these decades, from child to adult, ""Bewitched"" ALWAYS brings a smile to my face.",Bewitched: Season 6
1031703,"Pairing Salma Hayek and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz in a campy, comic buddy western turns out to be a mildly amusing ploy, but I just wish this 2006 film had more true grit and a sharper sense of the characters than the screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen exhibits. As vividly beautiful as the two actresses are, together they are physically and temperamentally too similar to be credible opposites. They are both compelling enough presences onscreen, especially playing such self-sufficient women, but the lack of contrast makes it hard to think they are little more than two halves of the same character. They are guided by first-time filmmakers Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg, which may account for the lack of visual flair that Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Tarantino could have brought to the story. Regardless, the pacing is lightning-quick, and the cartoonish touches provide the requisite popcorn entertainment.Set in turn-of-the-last-century Mexico, two women are leading separate lives - Sara Sandoval is the pampered, worldly daughter of a wealthy landowner, and Maria Alvarez is the dirt-poor farm girl who has relied on her horse sense and keen marksmanship. Their paths cross when seedy, bloodthirsty robber baron Tyler Jackson steals from their respective fathers and kills them both. Naturally, Sara and Maria seek revenge but must settle their own class-conflict squabbling first (via the inevitable cat-fighting scene). With the help of grizzled former bank robber Bill Buck, Sara and Maria become ""Las Bandidas"", Mexico's version of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Things get complicated when Jackson hires New York criminologist Quentin Cooke to track down the women, but you can probably guess that Quentin succumbs to their ample charms. The script throws in some interesting economic theory discussions, but mostly flimsy excuses are made to insert some silly scenes like having the women dress as saloon prostitutes out of the Moulin Rouge to seduce Quentin.Other than the mandatory gunplay, the elaborate stunts include a Tarzan-like use of a swinging chain, the creative use of ice skates during a heist, a slo-mo action scene that feels stolen fromThe Matrix, and a paean to the famous river-jumping scene inButch Cassidy. There is no doubt that Cruz and Hayek are having a good time, though they are hardly stretched here. Even though they bond in a predicable way, it would have been more interesting to insert some ambiguity along the lines ofThelma & Louise. With his bedraggled Marilyn Manson-like hair bested only by Javier Bardem's pageboy inNo Country for Old Men, Dwight Yoakam is not quite as menacing a presence as Walker. Steve Zahn also seems comparatively passive as Quentin, even though he looks appropriately dazed in the seduction scene. Sam Shepard is barely in the film as Buck, but he makes his brief sequence count with reliable authority. The extras on the 2007 DVD are sparse - a superficial four-minute making-of featurette, the original theatrical trailer, and a commentary track by Hayek and Cruz, has entertainment value but not too much insight into the production itself.",Bandidas
456127,"1966's Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, ""A Man for All Seasons"" is the story of Sir Thomas Moore, counselor to King Henry VIII of England but a devout man of God first.  This ordering of priorities places an dreadful air of inevitability over Director Fred Zinneman's austere but moving production, which features a talented cast and the superb dialogue from the play of the same name.Henry VIII (played with egotistical gusto by Robert Shaw) wishes to divorce Catherine of Aragon, who had been unable to bear him a son and heir.  The Catholic Church declines to grant him a divorce.  The King demands the support of Sir Thomas More (Paul Schofield), his Chancellor since the death of Cardinal Woolsey (Orson Welles).  Moore, a devout and relentlessly honest man, resists the King's demand.  Henry will tolerate no resistance on this matter, and Moore's enemies, including the schemer Cromwell (Leo McKern) and an ambitious young man (John Hurt) will frame him, leading to his trial and death for treason.""A Man for All Seasons"" poses a number of provocative moral challenges, not least the sagacity of Moore's refusal to bend to the King, at the cost of his life and his family's welfare.  A question not pursued by the movie is why Moore, an experienced man of government, would not take reasonable measures to defend himself against betrayal in a time of rough and tumble court politics, where the price of failure might be death.  This refusal makes for a cleaner but less historically accurate story lineThis movie is very highly reocmmended as a superbly done drama, still worth watching all these many years later.",N/A
286506,"This film exhibits a curious blend of meticulous attention to detail in presenting historical accuracy and gross historical inaccuracies and anachronisms. According to the director commentory on my DVD, the Viking ships were constructed as authentically as possible.  The horses were genuine fjordland horses, distinctively small to survive in that habitat.The Viking village was built according to our information. The bounding from oar to oar as the ship entered home port was said to be a real Viking tradition.Perhaps the most glaring anachronism to the casual viewer is that Norman-style castles, such as the restored fort La Latte, where the action takes place late in the film, didn't exist in Britain until after the Norman invasion, several centuries after this story takes place. No doubt, this anachronism was ignored because this Norman castle provided a visually much more dramatic structure and setting for the final confrontations than anything actually in Britian in this historical time frame.The historical Vikings this story is based upon were from Denmark, not Norway. No doubt Norway was chosen because of the dramatic fjord scenery and because Americans  tend to associate Vikings with Norway, ancestral home of Eric the Red and kin.When Tony Curtis(Eric) was staked at the ocean shore to drown at high tide, he should have died of hypothermia long before drowning. A striking brunette, such as Elizabeth Taylor, would seem a more attractive prize princess than the blond Janet Leigh, to these Vikings, surrounded by blonds.  The dramatic, if misogynistic, incident where Prince Einar cuts off, with thrown axes, the pigtails of a wife accused of adultery is (of course) pure historical hokum, if entertaining(especially since the audience knows that the womanizing Einar has been bedding this comely woman). The victorius Vikings  are portrayed as spending most of their spare time in drunken orgies, in competition with some of the classic pirate films and  the Roman orgies in some of the historical spectacles  of this period. Nothing is shown of the farming, animal tending, fishing, and weapons and clothing making that occupied most Vikings when not on raids.There is the question of why Einar held off killing Eric when Eric's sword broke during their duel. Only Einar knows for sure, but the obvious possibilites include 1)He was not clear if Eric was his half brother 2)He decided a hateful queen Morgana(Janet Leigh) was not worth  killing Eric for 3)He was afraid of the sorceress's prophesy that he who killed Eric would be cursed. Perhaps a blend of  all these considerations caused Einar's fatal hesitation.The script would appear to have pretentions of Shakesperian greatness, with one(Eric) of 3 rivals for the hand of Princess Morgana being a mere Viking slave, but unknowingly by birth, having a claim to the thrones of both the English principality of Northumbria and the Viking settlements ruled by Einar, after his father's death. The former rulers of each kingdom vanquished and his true heritage revealed, Eric now represents the potential amalgam between the various prior settlers of the British Isles and the encroaching Vikings, who not only loot the English, but also establish settlements and petty kingdoms, culminating in the Norman invasion of 1066.  As I see it, the greatest failing of this film as an epic story is the failure to exploit this symbolism after the funerary rites for Einar. In the parting scene, Morgana appears to be wearing the same crown that the previous queen wore, suggesting she is queen and presumably Eric is king of Northumbria. If so, this change is status  happened unbelievably quickly, before Einar's funeral! It would have been much more definitive if we had observed Eric's successful campaign to convince the powers that he was the rightful king of Northrumbria, if not also the Viking settlement he was a former slave in, and to witness his conversion to Christianity(if he was not already a Christian) to fit in better with his queen and English subjects and to symbolize the potential union of northmen and English. In the absence of this extension, this film is merely an elaborate swashbuckler tale.",N/A
1119308,"Of all the Horrorfest films for 2007, this one caught my eye from the trailer so it was the first I watched on DVD.  Others have reviewed the basic plot but to make a long story short... Ian Stone keeps getting killed in bizarre situations and wakes up in another life.  One day he's a hockey player, then an office worker, then a taxi driver.  But every time he wakes up, he brings elements of that former life with him.  Mostly his girlfriend and the demonic creatures that are murdering him.  Ian must figure out why these things keep killing him to save himself and the girl. (There.  Basic story with little spoilers)  This movie works because you know as little as Ian does and the fun comes in the solving of the mystery.  I don't think this should have been included in a ""Horror"" set because it is more sci-fi fantasy than classic horror.  (Although, if you would classify the tv version of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as horror, then this qualifies)  I would put this right up there with tv's ""Buffy"" because it has a lot of the same elements.  In fact, I wish this were a backdoor pilot because the end leaves it open for more storytelling and I would definitely watch.  So, don't go into this expecting ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".  Go in with an open mind and you will find a little gem that is worth multiple viewings.",N/A

822141,"It's hard to figure the film audiences of today. That this slick political thriller would go pear shaped at the box office seems more than a little unfair, considering that far less accomplished films have cut better figures.Sure, the setting may seem a little musty with all the big tykes from the FBI, the Secret Service, Special Ops and the CIA making an appearance in a criss-cross of motives (kidnap of the President's daughter). But there are still con-tricks and plot twists aplenty, all punctuated by Mamet's signature dialogue, which is as clipped as the mannerisms of the actors. The plot twists are not the usual cerebral kind that we have come to expect from him. They're more action oriented.Spartan almost plays in real-time, with us, the audience unraveling the meandering plot along with the characters in the film. It whisks us in a dizzy rush of events. We are not given time to think, we are not supposed to think; this is not a reflective film. There is nothing beneath the surface, nothing new. Stop and think, and all sorts of huge implausibilities immediately become apparent.But to its credit it chugs along with commendable pace and purpose. If I were to be particularly fastidious, I'd say that in the last half an hour Mamet appears to have given in to pandering his audience with what they want in a spy thriller: excitement and melodrama.Fortunately, Spartan stays clear of the scatter-shot editing and wall-to-wall pounding musical scores that plague most modern action thrillers. Val Kilmer is more than adequate as the effaced warrior. Baby-face Kristen Bell's guest appearance hangs in one's memory.It's a well-crafted and satisfying film, undeserving of its low rating, and certainly a very worthy rental at the very least.",N/A

(The original series is about 500 times better than the mediocre big-screen Brian De Palma 1980s film with the colorless Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness. The second 1990s TV series was also better than the movie, but this original series is the best.) It was, hands down, the most violent television series up to that time, and remains pretty strong even by modern standards. The first episode of season two features a young, pre-""Bewitched"" Elizabeth Montgomery in an unforgettable performance as a moll named ""Rusty Heller"", who gets the hots for Robert Stack.",N/A
1098524,"Captivity starts with a grisly murder, a scene reminiscent of each of the worst scenes in any of the Saw movies.  A hooded, disguised killer has a victim strapped to a chair, with a tube in his mouth.  The tube is connected to some sort of toxic chemical, and there is no way for the tube to be removed.  It's clear that the victim is horrified, and completely aware of the impending doom.  It's creepy, ominous, and sets a great tone for the remainder of the movie.Elisha Cuthbert is stunning as she plays Jennifer Tree, a hyper-busy, some what conceited covergirl/model, constantly doing interviews, and appearing on TV.  She lives life beyond the means of most, going so far as buying gourmet food for her dog!  This attention, however, draws some unwanted attention that eventually causes problems.Shortly into the film, it becomes clear that Jennifer is being stalked and filmed, establishing very clear foreshadowing, and causing the viewer to connect her potential attacker and the previous murder.  Sure enough, she's drugged, abducted, and the stage is set for the rest of the movie.It's really a cross between the riddles of Saw and Se7en, the imprisonment of Kiss the Girls, and the torture aspect of Hostel.If viewers can get past the borderline plot plagiarism, the suspense is actually somewhat enticing, the acting fairly believable, and the scenarios quite ingenius and terrifying.  Elisha Cuthbert is mesmerizing, absolutely stealing every scene; she's an absolute star whose beauty is truly worth the price of admission.  Although, it's hard to watch a single scene without thinking of a myriad other horror movies from which ""Captivity"" borrowed various concepts.It's mindless gore, suspense, and screams for the not-so-faint-hearted.  It's exactly what one would expect, and an overall thrilling ride.",N/A

The movie starts badly, like a black comedy that is not funny.Then it turns into an interesting story. We learn that Jackson's character is a widower with a teenage daughter. The wife got killed by a burgler and then the burgler got killed by somebody while in prison. His best pal in the force was Ed Harris, who was somehow involved in everything. Jackson doesn't handle his single parenthood too well.One day he gets a job order, seemingly from the police, to clean up a murder scene. He does, and then finds out he was trapped: he has helped hide an actual murder case and now is on the police's suspect list.Mendes is the not-yet-confirmed widow.

516263,"When ""Lake Placid"" was first released, I just assumed that it was yet another ""Jaws"" rip-off and consequently avoided it. It was only later, when I discovered that it was written by David E. Kelley (creator of ""The Practice"", ""Ally McBeal"" and ""Boston Legal""), that I decided to give it a try. Although it is true that, in principle, ""Lake Placid"" is a ""Jaws"" rip-off (substituting a 30 foot crocodile for a shark), to describe it that way is extremely misleading. In fact, ""Lake Placid"" is a sarcastic comedy that's purpose seems to be to point out just how weird the residents of Maine really are (just in case Stephen King novels haven't already convinced you of this), rather than to provide any actual scares.Top billing in this film is given to Bill Pullman (as a Fishing and Game representative) and Bridget Fonda (as a palaeontologist), but really this film belongs to Oliver Platt (as an eccentric university professor who believes that crocodiles are god-like and who likes to swim with them). Pullman just spends the film looking sarcastic or bemused and every time Fonda appears, she falls into the lake, but Platt gets all the good lines and really carries the film. In fact, I think he has more screen time and lines of dialogue than the two supposed stars. Mention should also be made of Betty White (that sweet old lady from ""The Golden Girls"") who appears in a supporting role as a ""sweet little old lady"" who isn't as sweet as she first appears. If you have seen Betty White in ""Boston Legal"", and liked her character there, you will really love her in ""Lake Placid"". She steals the show every time she appears. And finally, the crocodile. Yes, there are one or two gory moments in this film (a diver gets bitten in half and a deputy gets his head bitten off), but these moments are few and far between. For the most part, my family just found the crocodile to be cute and found ourselves to be cheering him on.This is the best ""natural predator"" film that I have ever seen and it thoroughly deserves to become a cult classic.",N/A

1117883,"National Treasure 2 is one of the rare sequels that improves on the original, which I liked a lot. It seems these days the movie franchises come in threes: Bourne series, Matix, Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Oceans 11-13. In pretty much every case, the second outting is inferior to the first, but the series redeems inself with the third installment. NT2 on the other hand, took virtually the same story arc, plot devices and kept it interesting. I'm eager for the third installment. The star of NT2, Nicolas Cage, is one of those actors who I've had to develop a taste for, but lately I must say that he's come into his own. Even in his less successful movies (of late) like ""Next"" and ""Lord of War"" he's quite watchable. And though NT2 is a bit of an ensemble movie where the secondary roles are both well cast and well acted, Cage is the heart of the movie and rightly so. I also appreciated this movie for it's respectful treatment of the President - clearly meant to be George Bush II - something quite unusual for Hollywood.",N/A

606632,"This is not a slasher flick, gore movie, or anything typical, really. It's best classified as psychological horror. There are no monsters, things that jump out at you, or any cliched horror movie staples. Rather, the horror comes from the subtle yet disturbing imagery throughout the film, especially on the Tape. This is a thinking person's horror movie, and tells its story through hints, both visual and in the screenplay.As you know by now, the plot revolves around a mysterious videotape that somehow results in your demise exactly 7 days after being seen. The central character is a reporter, excellently portrayed by Naomi Watts, who investigates the source of this killer tape after her niece becomes a victim. Naomi follows the clues on the tape like a modern day Nancy Drew and is led to a spooky island that is obviously the one shown on the tape. From there, she meets a strange family with a bunch of sinister secrets that are revealed to us one by one. The mystery element is very effective, and keeps you involved in the story. The conclusion clearly leaves room for a sequel, which has obviously already been made.The acting is excellent, as is the writing. The story is set in the Pacific northwest, and I'm not sure if it was filmed there, but wherever it was filmed is gloomy, rainy, and adds perfectly to the atmosphere of the movie.In short, very well-done, engaging, enjoyable, and also disturbing.",N/A

1172568,"Here's the deal on the ""official"" second season release.  Paramount owns the distribution rights to the entire ""Beverly Hillbillies"" series. It holds control over the 35mm network prints of the series that were used in the 1960's.  Hillbillies creator Paul Henning also legally owned the rights to the first 55 episodes of the series.  That's all of season one and most of season two.  About two years ago, his estate released those 55 episodes in two volumes. Unfortunately, because Paramount owns the negatives and master prints, MPI video(which distributed the Henning sets) only had access to film prints which were struck decades ago. These episodes contained original network sponsor sketches, etc, but they were grainy and barely watchable. Paramount apparently figured that most fans who purchased volume one of the Henning series, wouldn't be motivated to purchase it again.  So they began with the ""official"" second season, with intentions of re-releasing season one at a later date (like they did with I Love Lucy). So, what are you getting by purchasing this ""official"" season?  First, you'll get *all* the season two episodes, remastered from the original film prints. That means no scratches, lines, debris or picture shifting.  Paramount is excellent in restoring picture quality.  However, it remains to be seen whether Paramount will use all the original music.  Much of it was composed by Paul Henning, & there may have been some royalty issues. Paramount has been hesitant to use incidental music that it doesn't hold legal right to in its DVD releases.  Also, the artwork on season two is horrendous.Season two spanned 1963-64. The cover photo is from a 1969 episode (Jethro has sideburns for cying out loud!).

1180730,"I never had issues with Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" besides some minor ones with the silly dad-made-him story and the goofy looking flashbacks that seem to belong in an Oliver Stone film. More-or-less though, I liked it.The one problem, no sequel. After all, the point of the ""origin"" film is to set up at least two sequels, so you accept the slow pacing and the emphasis on how and why knowing that the set-up will pay off in the second film. But, what if there's not a second film?Now the ""Hulk"" is ""Incredible"" and they're correct, I don't quite believe it. I've read that Norton envisioned a longer, more emotionally complex film and the studios, in typical studio fashion, slashed and burned it. So what is left?While the new Hulk still looks a little too waxy on the skin to be alive (why is it only George Lucas can make completely CGI characters that truly blend?) his emotions come through better thanks to Norton acting out all the scenes for the animators (including a new, hi-def 3-D motion capture for facial expressions) and the result is a more engrossing Hulk character. Unfortunately he has little to do.The film is a simple, long chase. The only twist is that the person doing the chasing is an aging commando who wants a ""gamma"" induced boost, which he eventually OD's on and becomes a monster. The result is the obligatory clash of the titans, a destroyed NY city and a finale, almost. The films doesn't want to explain or tie up anything and that's a problem. Once again, there's no end, and no planed sequel.The film shows a third possible mutation / nemesis for Hulk, but only for a second and never returns. Meanwhile the big, bad second hulk monster is not killed, and doesn't return to human form, and is simply unconscious when last we see it. So the movie is supposed to be about Bruce Banner finding a cure, he doesn't and the Hulk defeating the bad guy, he doesn't, and a love story, unresolved, and a chase thriller, that stops chasing, then stalls.The movie lacked the depth needed to carry such an open ending, and with no sequel in site (the movie made scarcely more than Ang Lees but was far more expensive) all that's left is a second origin film and no end in site.",N/A

1074066,"The Fugitive had, for the most part, great scripts and directors who contributed mightily to the show's quality (the show slipped somewhat in it's last season due to the departure of producer Alan Armer). However, what really made this show special was the presence of David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble. At the same time actors like Adam West and William Shatner were over-emoting and hamming their way into infamy, Janssen conveyed his emotions and feelings with subtle facial expressions and through his eyes. This technique played perfectly into the nature of the character -- a person who had to be guarded and cautious 24 hours a day so as not to give away his true indentity. Janssen was the only acting constant on The Fugitive (Barry Morse appeared in less than half of the episodes and Bill Raisch -- the one armed man -- barely appeared at all before he presence was increased for the fourth and final season) and was in almost every scene of every episode. It's no wonder Janssen was relieved when the series ended in 1967.David Janssen never really reached the heights he achieved during the run of The Fugitive. He was never out of demand, to be sure. He starred in other TV series (O'Hara, US Treasury, Harry O) and made many theatrical and TV movies (the underrated Warning Shot, The Green Berets, Marooned, Two Minute Warning, etc.). However, The Fugitive was (and will always be) the crowning achievement of his career. It's sad that Janssen died so young -- he was such a good actor that it's likely that he could have been cast in a role that would have given him the recognition he deserved. Along with Roy Huggins and Alan Armer, David Janssen made The Fugitive one of the finest dramatic series in televison history.","The Fugitive: Season 1, Vol. 1"

Their ""evil plots"" brought forth humor and creativity with excellent word plays. The acting of the 3 nerds added realistic element, I have known several people like Andrew (creative, wishy washy, approval seeking) and Warren (smooth talker, manipulitive, ego centric) and of course everyone knows a Jonathan, (intelligent, wanting to be taken seriously but only tolerated by the in crowd so his talents could be used.) The ""Big Bad"" though was the main attraction this season.Until Season Six I never paid much attention to Spike, what with the undeniable chemistry between Buffy & Angel. I had actually stopped watching Buffy after the fourth season because why bother when the heavy hitters were gone (Angel and Faith) I only recently watched seasons 5 through 7. Spikes character grew and changed so interestingly I rented all the episodes of Angel that featured him in it so I could follow his character to the end (and had the excellent suprise of seeing Andrews character morph into a really interesting personna).James Marsters ability to convey an emotion with just a widening of his eye and a hint of a smile or a tear is fantastic. I was deeply moved by his reaction to Buffys resurrection and how subtly he played it.Of the episodes that were tops in this season, ONCE MORE WITH FEELING tops the list (the music was so stuck in my head I had to buy the sountrack CD!) SMASHED, the episode that everyone considers so controversial is saved by Marsters acting, again the fluidity and depth of expression with subtle facial changes is what drew me in. The allegory of the house crumbling was beautiful, poetic. The most useless episode, that still managed to have some meaning (again thanks to Marsters, he gave a brief speech to Buffy worth hearing) was DOUBLE MEAT PALACE.I loved the tie up of the loose end concerning Riley in AS YOU WERE. Normal Again was an excellent episode about choices.All together there were so many plots and subplots that engaged me I bought seasons 4, 5, and 7 (mainly so I could trace the evolving character of Spike).

555433,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child. I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.Having said that, I am unhappy with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and implying that this will make babies smarter!! These videos may be fun for older kids, but tv/videos are generally are NOT good for babies' brains!After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%, and 3) consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems. Interestingly, there is even some odds increase for bullying later on, for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2 and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2. Of course, I realize that this is probably not realistic for most people. There are studies that recommend preferably sitting with your child and watching t.v. together rather than just propping them in front of the tv by themselves, to make the experience more enriching and interactive (within limits of course - I doubt too much for babies and not more than the 2 hours per day recommended). But I wanted to put this information out so that other parents and caregivers could make better informed parenting decisions. Maybe it will encourage some to limit television usage for babies and children and look for other outlets when possible.For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time! Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance. Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",N/A

You really do not need to be a fan of Stern to appreciate this funny and informative movie. And let's get real; when Stern was on free radio, a lot of those that hated him listened to him even more than those that liked him. As they put it in the movie, haters also wanted to know what he was going to say next!I was really surprised to see how good a job Howard did with his acting, and Robin Quivers and Fred Norris, who  also play their real personas in the film, did not lag behind at all. This trio delivers laughs-a-plenty, and shows why so many people love them. The bit in which they use the fill-in the blank competition is priceless, and will have you rolling on the floor laughing. Especially when you see Kenny (pig vomit), the program director at NBC, go berserk over what he was hearing on air. I have to stop here and comment on how Giamatti, who played the role of ""pig vomit"", shows his great skills for acting, and you can see that he had those skills way before his success with ""Sideways"".The film portrays Stern's wife, Allison, as his muse and object of desire. Everything he does is for her. Too bad they got divorced following this production, but this does not spoil any of the fun.

While not as polished looking as Suspiria or Inferno, or technically advanced, I find it still holds up with time.The story of a young girl who can communicate with insects, and her stay at a creepy Swiss boarding school, complete with slasher killer, this one is for horror fans everywhere.May I add, the Anchor Bay edition is the best looking transfer still, without those annoying Italian language shifts mid-conversation, and with the gore complete.",N/A
794012,"As someone who's had prior exposure to Kundalini yoga through hands-on classes, and has been studying/working with chakra energy for years, I can safely say this DVD will leave a beginner clueless. The exercises are basic hodge podge movements with no explanation of their origins. I've learned more off of YouTube than viewing this DVD.Things lacking:a) Lack of Kundalini instruction and explanation. Not even a simple mention of serpent-coiled energy.b) Lack of clear instruction of our chakras and their purpose. Just mentions ""clearing your brain,"" or letting out ""bottled energy."" No mention of specific chakras, their effects on the body, associations, etc.c) Terrible video editing - really funny they show you a snazzy cover with Gurutej on the beach, but in reality you're in the corner of somebody's house, and you can see the cars whizzing by outside. The entire video looks like a high school project.I like Joan Price's review that states, ""Then, chakra by chakra, she explains and demonstrates."" Where? Did Joan even watch the DVD? Maybe she watched a different one than I did.Bottomline: Looking to be a serious student of Kundalini and chakra energy work? Look elsewhere. Looking to spend an hour doing feel good exercises.

410898,"It's hard to believe I never saw this as a kid. I saw just about every horror/sci-fi movie ever put on TV back then.......somehow I missed this one. I watched this film on a HD channel and it probably looked better than it ever has. I am aware of the book 'I Am Legend' which this and 'The Omega Man' were taken from but, I have never read it. I know this film follows the book closer than 'The Omega Man' but, I think that film edges this one out. The biggest problem with this film is the Vampire/Zombies are so slow and weak they pose no threat to anyone. In one scene Price is covered with these creatures and he pushes them off of himself like they were a bunch of blankets. I know, I know, in the old days ""zombies were slow"" but, in this film it is truly ridiculous and hurts the overall tension.  Another problem is Price is held up in his house which couldn't keep a gaggle of geese out let alone a horde of zombies who's only motivation is to kill him! ....all they would have to do is drop a match and this little chicken coup would have been a blaze. On the plus side, Price is terrific as usual and the film does have some atmosphere. I don't know how the DVD transfer is on this edition but, I have this film on another release with 'Panic In The Year Zero' and the transfer in very good. I'm sure part of the reason I like 'The Omega Man' over this film is that I saw it in theaters as a kid age 9 and it was just too cool to believe in those days.",Last Man on Earth VHS

I get that their are people who get a little queasy or apprehensive because someone cusses or shows their genitals, my advice: this movie isn't for you because you will see penis and breasts, and will hear plenty of cussing. Everyone else: this is a hilarious movie about a love triangle or square, possibly. Apatow and friends have a knack for taking very specific moments from most people's lives and turning them into a funny movie with a lot of heart i.e. teenage angst/ going to college in Superbad, losing one's virginity in 40-year old Virgin, becoming a new parent in Knocked up, and getting broken up with in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

People crash land in a country where humans and dinosaurs live together in peace&harmony.; It's an interesting series, with some potentially good ideas, with a pre-Prison Break Wentworth Miller and David Thewlis as a surprisingly sympathetic villain.In ""Dinotopia"", Miller and Tyron Leitso star as a pair of half-brothers who crash land in Dinotopia. (To make this movie family-friendly, they describe their late father as ""socially active"") They are greeted by the presiding matriarch, Alice Krige. Since they are in a worker's paradise, they can't choose their own jobs. She also has them listening to dinosaurs pound their feet, getting them into polytheistic/pantheistic meditation. Furthermore, the half-brothers must abide by Dinotopia's laws. They must be vegetarian-and the kicker- they can't fight in self-defense if carnivorous dinosaurs attack. In the meantime, the half-brothers end up smitten with the mayor of Waterfall City's daughter. (In a not-so-family friendly twist, she skinny dips with one of them,but nothing results from the love triangle) They also encounter the free-thinking villain, David Thewlis. He wants the people of Dinotopia to have freedom of thought and freedom of motion,as well as the freedom to defend themselves- but he's stigmatized.The sunstones that are defending Dinotopia from carnivorous dinosaurs are failing. The half-brothers embark on a quest to restore them. As for the love triangle, it's left unresolved.""Dinotopia"" has some good special effects and great acting.

1082644,"Automaton Transfusion is an ultra low budget, gore-fest, zombie bash that has been made my some obvious zombie flick fanatics, but sadly any potential that it has gets squandered.  The story, for lack of a better word, revolves around a group of high school seniors that get caught in the middle of a zombie epidemic, and try to get out of town.  While story isn't really all that important in a pure zombie flick, it would be nice if we at least cared a little bit about the characters here.  We don't, at all, and instead just pray for their bloody demise.  It should also be noted that these zombies are of the running variety, which would mean that the action and scares would be aplenty.  Well, they aren't either, and the film as a whole just comes off as boring.  There are loads of gore effects, where most of Automaton Transfusion's budget seemed to go.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, as the gore effects are quite well done for a low budget flick, and are every bit as disgusting as any gorehound could hope for (one scene in particular will leave your jaw on the floor, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about), and are reason enough to check out this flick.  Other than that though, there really isn't much else to Automaton Transfusion.  Maybe that's all fine and good for you, and if so then by all means check this out.  If you're looking for something that has a little bit of depth to it however (and doesn't have a grainy picture either), then Automaton Transfusion is definitely not for you.",Automaton Transfusion

121426,"I had pretty low expectations going into this film (the reviews have been generally negative), but I was surprised how much I liked it, and surprised by its tone.  It has a reputation of being the 6th Dirty Harry movie in disguise, which is not true.  Sure, Clint's character, Nick, has many similar qualities to that of Dirty Harry, but this film is a lot different than the Dirty Harry films.The film is rather dark, both literally and figuratively.  The film takes place mostly at night in dark interiors, and aside from a few one liners from Eastwood, Sheen, Julia, and a few select cops, it's a mostly serious film.  It's also pretty violent, and not really in a cartoonish way.  There's a scene in a bar where Charlie, looking for information about Clint (who has been taken hostage), spits a fireball in a bartender's face, beats up several patrons, beats up one guard dog and shoots another (even though we don't see the bullet hit the dog), and burns the place down.  Sheen's girlfriend in the film (played by Lara Flynn Boyle) is nearly strangled in a pretty savage scene.  It does have a light ending, but overall, it's pretty brutal.  If it does have to be compared to any Dirty Harry film, it can be compared to Sudden Impact, the fourth Dirty Harry film and the only one directed by Eastwood himself.  That's the darkest of the Dirty Harry films, both aesthetically and literally.Many thought the film was overlong (running 121 minutes), but it wasn't.  There aren't any superfluous scenes in it.  They're needed to give background information on Sheen and his character.  It has some great action scenes in it, especially the first chase scene (also shot at night).  The film does have a few problems, though.  Julia's accent flucuates a bit (even though it's not an awful accent), some of the dialogue is silly, and some of the minor performances (particularly that of the Lieutentant) are overdone.  If you like Eastwood (as I do), this is worth checking out at least once, maybe twice.  If not, you can skip it.",N/A
719540,"Quite possibility the best werewolf film made since An American Werewolf in London.In Dog Soldiers, a group of British squaddies, out on a training exercise in the vast wilderness of the Scottish Highlands, come up against a `troop' of werewolves.Having dispatched a group of superior British SAS special forces, surely the regular British troops won't be much of a problem for the 7ft hairy howlers. Wrong; through their toughness, training and the little incentive of staying alive, the squaddies put a brave determined fight, fuelled with typical gallows humour (`I hope I give you the sh***' says one of the squaddies before he becomes `dinner').Whilst it takes bits from Aliens and Night of the Living Dead, you have to remember that these films in turn take inspiration from earlier films, Aliens, for example, is a sort of futuristic `Zulu' and the siege of Rourke's Drift in Natal. There is also the look up to Predator, though instead of muscle bound men we have a sort of mismatch of determined, dogged, (`scuse the pun) and well trained group of terriers (oh dear), the sort of blokes that make up the British Army (or 'the scum of the earth' as Wellington famously called his own troops)..This is a unique modern horror movie, in that it throws out the CGI possibilities. CGI never ever works in horror movies. The digital animation, no matter how realistic, severs the link between the viewers' expectations that the `monster' and the `victim' share the same `stage' (ground, etc). Whilst CGI brings wonders to fantasy films, such as Lord of the Rings and Jurassic Park, it seems too false and detached to exactly what is going on, on the screen. And that is what is great about Dog Soldiers, the wolves are on screen and you never have the irritated inkling that the victims are not staring death in the face, but are merely looking into a blue screen. American Werewolf in Paris, in particular, suffers greatly from this problem (among other things as well, to be fair).The cast includes fairly unknowns; however Kevin McKidd is most famous for his role in Trainspotting and Rome. Sean Pertwee has been in a few movies, including Event Horizon and coincidentally played Caesar in a series about Roman Emperors around the time McKidd was in Rome. Both Roman series where made and shown by the BBC (and HBO).I guess you will have to watch it to found out who lives and who doesn't, but I assure you it is worth it. It wasn't a huge success, but I believe it has enjoyed a second wave of success through word of mouth and has got itself a small cult following. There is a belated sequel planned, which is rumoured to be a bigger budget film than this one and aimed more at the US market. If so, then this film may get searched out again by a new wave of curious horror film addicts.Dog Soldiers is a perfect film for a night in while the rain crashes down outside and howls pierce the cold night air! And, it all ends with a poke at the English tabloids, and a shock victory against the `old enemy' (Germany) in a little game of football being played hundreds of miles away from the horror of the Scottish wilderness.4 Stars.",N/A

It's as much theater as rock band, but then what great band isn't as much theater as rock?This DVD shows a concert tour the group did, rather than a Las Vegas show.

As such, it's a lot of fun to watch and listen to, and is not likely to grow old with repeated watching.I'm not going to dwell on each song or particular aspects of the show, other than to say that their performance of Baba O'Reilly is one of the best rock performances recorded, ever, by anyone.

WALL-E (voiced by beeps and Ben Burtt), our hero, is a glorified trash compactor who has made the mountains.  As we follow him across the vast landscape, we learn that he is the last of his kind and that he is indeed on earth.  Humans fled years ago because they bought into the commercialism of the Buy-n-Large stores that ruled the earth.  The resulting garbage overran the planet.But WALL-E is not a mindless robot.  He is curious and collects bits and pieces of things that are still intact.  At night, he takes these to his bunker where they are on display a la Ariel.  His only companions are a cockroach and a video tape of Hello Dolly.Into this world comes Eve (voiced by beeps and Elissa Knight).  Eve is another robot but much more high tech.  She is on a classified mission.  WALL-E immediately falls for her.  So much so, in fact, that when the spaceship returns to collect Eve, WALL-E tags along.  Suddenly, the two find themselves caught up in an adventure with the future of mankind at stake.  Can they save humanity?This isn't quite Pixar's best, but it is very good.  I mean, we've got robots who hardly speak as our main characters, yet we are completely rooting for them.  And even though the dialogue is limited, these robots have personality.  But it was the limited dialogue that got to me.  I got tire of long stretches where the only words we heard were Wall-E and EVE calling each others' names, especially during the climax.There are few characters here.  Frankly, that makes sense due to the extra effort it takes to develop character and story without dialogue.

Be sure to examine each disc in good light before your return period is up.The picture quality (4:3 format by the way) is marginal...how did they recorded this stuff anyway?

332878,"For my money, The Deadly Mantis is one of the better American monster movies of the 1950s.  I really don't know why it is overshadowed even by the clearly inferior likes ofAttack of the Giant Leeches,The Killer Shrews, andGiant Gila Monster (B&W;).  The Deadly Mantis follows the standard script, but it held off from showing the monster for over half an hour, allowing the military brains and scientists ample time to come up with a theory as to just what they were facing.  Perhaps more importantly, the giant praying mantis looks pretty impressive - I'm not saying that people left the theatre believing that a giant mantis might pop up at any minute, but he's about one hundred times more realistic than the likes of the giant grasshoppers fromBeginning of the End (Special Edition), even when he's climbing a national monument.I'm not sure how the science of this works, but a volcanic eruption in the South Pacific somehow triggers a warming ""reaction"" in a section of the Arctic Ocean, which in turns serves to thaw out this monstrous creature that no one ever knew existed.  I'm not sure what a praying mantis was ever doing up in the Arctic Circle, which was never all that tropical in any ancient era, but I certainly wasn't surprised to see him head south soon after awakening.  Not only is it colder than a witch's - well, you know - there's also pretty slim pickings in the old food department up there.  Fortunately for our monster, the American military has supplied a few tasty snacks in easily-destroyed radar installations along his way.  Now you would think a humongous praying mantis that makes a military transport plane look like a child's toy would be easy to find, be it on the ground or in the air, but the military has so much trouble tracking the thing that they actually call upon civilians to help them zero in on it.The acting in this one isn't bad at all.  William Hopper sort of has a little Peter Graves thing going, Craig Stevens certainly looks the part of a hero, and Donald Randolph makes things a little more interesting by sounding like Vincent Price every so often.  Alix Talton nails her big scream scene, but I must admit I really couldn't get into watching a bunch of soldier boys (some of whom were young enough to be her son) go gaga over her.One of the few drawbacks of the film is the fact that you only see a limited amount of destruction and fighting.  Wiping out an Eskimo village just doesn't compare to Godzilla stomping Tokyo flat for the umpteenth time (and, actually, the scene with all the villagers grabbing boats and paddling for their lives is taken from the filmS.O.S. Eisberg), but I have a feeling the giant mantis would not have been very impressive in any serious action scenes.  I was also disappointed by the romantic element of the plot - not because it was totally irrelevant (which it was) but because it got slipped in there at the end, just when I thought I had finally found an old American monster movie free of any needless love story.",N/A

1130132,"I honestly don't want to waste my time with this but I too have watched this film. I do enjoy George Romero zombie flicks and after watching this I thought this was a joke. More disappointed actually cause all I got was some rookie director coming up with a 'remake' of one of the master's well known title and jacking it all up. A rookie in the sense of trying to capture the dark, gritty, viciousness of the zombie epidemic as envisioned by Romero in his earlier films. Steve Miner has directed episodes of Dawson's Creek, (which explains some of this film's truly boring dialog and Ken and Barbie type characters) and Smallville (which has effectively turned Superman into a soap opera).What Miner has done here is show us that he can capture all of the plot lines, and zombie behavior previously shown in a dozen zombie flicks, put Mena Suvari (of American Beauty) in the lead and make a horrible horror movie.While this film might appeal to young folks who don't understand the art as developed by Romero, those who do will undoubtedly turn away from this one after the first half hour. It only takes that long to get an idea of the poor characters. Suvari plays an army Corporal (who carries a gun with no bullets. Why even pull it out?) Ving Rhames has a small part, perhaps wise enough to not stick around. Suvari's character is remarkably calm in the face of danger despite her seemingly bad decision making. The rest of the cast are like refugees from a Dawson's Creek episode. Nick Cannon (Mariah Cary's husband) plays the part of the bad a.., machismo Army Private, and while not giving a particularly good performance, due in part to the horrible script, Cannon does manage to bring some charisma and toughness to the character.The zombies seem to do extraordinary things one moment (like crawl on ceilings and run real fast-like the Dawn of the Dead remake), but when it comes to attacking the lead actors they seem inept. This picture doesn't do any justice to the zombie film genre. It ranks down there with the very low budget. The title was used to possibly draw attention to it's existence, nothing more.",N/A

He seems to feel comfortable in the role, and it seems like he and the other cast members had a great time filming it.Even the special effects were surprisingly good for such a relatively low-budget movie (even great at times; pretty bad at other times, but we're forgiving), and most important of all, the *story* felt like a good follow-up to the first movie, which was not the case with SST2.Also, I loved the marauder suits, even though they have relatively minor screen time.

1095007,"...is the setting for this rare production by the often innovative Zurich Opera House. The stage is Schubert's own music room, with Schubert himself in the throes of composing an opera, Fierrabras to be, on a story he has hardly begun to resolve himself. Schubert speaks occasionally but never sings, jots notes to himself, escorts his characters on and off stage through the innumerable doors of his imagination, and hovers anxiously as they sing his impassioned music. The story concerns a Frankish king, a Moorish prince, and a triangle of lovers from both camps. In many ways, the libretto is leftover Baroque, not quite coherent but open-ended enough to allow poetic outbursts of sentiment to be rendered as Lieder. The music is pure German romanticism, equipoised between Beethoven and Wagner. The juxtaposition is sketchy at best, although if one saw enough productions one might begin to suspend disbelief. After all, the story is no more absurd than most of Handel's. The clever folk at the Zurich Opera House have done well to stage Fierrabras 'psychologically' and symbolically, rather than as a gaudy chivalric pageant. The tentative presence of poor love-stricken Schubert - literally stricken, soon to die of syphilis - aptly corresponds to the tentative nature of the opera, the composer's effort to invent a genre to satisfy his romantic inklings. The same opera company, with conductor Franz Welser-M&ouml;st, has produced one of the most intelligent and satisfying DVDs of Mozart's Magic Flute - the only production I've seen that realizes Mozart's philosophical intent.Of course it's the music that justifies producing Fierrabras at all. Commissioned in 1823, it was never staged and Schubert was never paid for it. The first production ever was in Vienna in 1988. Oblivion was the fate of a whole generation of German opera, utterly overshadowed by Rossini and Donizetti. In this strange production from Zurich, it's the singing that wins my five-star approval. Tenor Cristoph Strehl, baritone Michael Volle, and soprano Juliane Banse deliver their arias in the rich vocal style of Schubert Lieder...which of course they are! The choruses of women and men that pop in and out of Schubert's mental doors are stirring, and the orchestral ruminations that underscore the spoken dialogue of the libretto are full of forebodings and interior meanings. The only weak performance is that of Twyla Robinson as the Moorish princess in love with Roland; both her singing and her acting are discordant, more appropriate to a 'can belto' Valkyrie than to this fragile self-referential psychodrama. Musically, perhaps the most impressive moments in the opera are the slightly chaotic ensembles, where each character seems to sing her/his thoughts to his/her own melody.It would be hard to deny that Rossini was more entertaining and Donizetti more theatrical, and that Schubert had little chance of holding the stage against them. But in our multifarious era, when all the music of history can be heard in our own salons, an opera like Fierrabras is a worthy addition to the DVD repertoire. I enjoyed it. You might also.",N/A
443555,"Kundun is a extraordinary story filled with colorful details of the Dalai Lama's life that were not apparent to me before I watched this movie. The message is deep, powerful, but the direction is not; this movie could have been made so much better if it was directed well.The story starts off with Lamo, a arrogant little boy, who goes on to become the humble Dalai Lama. He is said to have been born in sight of two crows, a sign which was apparent for all the incarnations of the Buddha, he himself is the 14th. His destiny takes him to the heart of Tibet, Lhasa, at a young age. His family follows, but their paths still separated from his. Lamo spends his time in the shadow of monks, learning vigorously the tasks, and teachings of Buddhism. As he grows older he becomes more and more involved with videos and documentaries that were gifted to Tibet by the United States, he begins to educated himself more and more about international relations. Meanwhile, the Chinese threaten to attack his country, in a desperate attempt he writes to the president of the United States, the United Nations, and etc for help. Bound by religion and strict ethics, he chooses not to fight back, instead watch the destruction of his land and people under the communist regime of Mao. He is haunted by images of blood and bodies of monks spread out on the street. He travels to China, hoping to settle things down, but is unable to. After his return, the Chinese threaten to kill him, knowing that his death would mean the death of hope in Tibet he chooses to flee to India.This story has a lot of Buddhist ideologies. One which stood out strongly to me was the concept of reincarnation, as Lamo was the 14th incarnation of the Dalai Lama, the compassionate Buddha. Another point which astounds me is that when attacked by the Chinese he chose not to fight back, even though he had an army, he followed the ideology of Buddhism which enforces peace and non-violence. He is also taught the concepts of Dharma by the monks, as well as taught how to meditate on a daily basis, the book of world religions teaches these basic fundamentals in the Buddhism chapter.",Kundun VHS
1142141,"Four American tourists, somewhere South of the border, on their last day of vacation and open for diversions, allow themselves to be talked into going to view a remote Mayan ruin with a European tourist they meet at the hotel. He is connected to a group who are executing an archeological dig at the ruin and he hasn't heard from them in a few days. So off the tourists all go, without a worry in the world.Their first clue should have been the hostile reception they get from the native people who live nearby the ruin, who leave no doubt about where they stand on visitors...but by then it's too late to turn back. The group ascends the pyramid to try to find out the fate of the archeological team and to wait for rescue from anyone who might notice they are missing, and things rapidly go south from there.This is my annual obligatory horror movie, and I have to say it held my interest. Definitely not for the squeamish...but if you're into horror movies, I doubt it will keep you up nights, although there is blood in plenty, some pretty nasty offings, and in a neat twist in the monster end of horror flicks, carnivourous plants that make the one in Little Shop of Horrors look like a well-mannered Pekinese. Well-acted for the genre, it was worth the time, and will leave you with the notion that the water isn't all you should be careful about in that region.",The Ruins
1117612,"This movie has more product placements and commercials than you would see in an evening of watching TV.  Many of these seem forced, out of place, and have a sour note quality.  However, this movie is being touted as the best movie of the year and in my opinion it deserves all of the praise and hype it is getting.  It is so good that it is hard to start describing why it is so good.The screen play and plot are relatively simple and uncomplicated and there are some scenes that could be improved but any weakness in the screenplay is more than offset by some of the scenes and lines that are some of the best I have seen in any movie in a long time.  Near the beginning we see the boys running track and we hear Juno comment that she loves watching their ""things flop up and down"" and ""all she can think of are all of those ""pork swords"".  We see the boys running throughout the rest of the movie and it is hard to erase this from your mind.  Then we have the fight over the senior prom.  Michael Cera's performance here as the wounded dad and exboyfriend is superb, of course Ellen Page does an outstanding job throughout the entire movie.  Another great scene is with J K Simmons (her dad) when she asks him if true and enduring love is possible.  Speaking from the perspective of a 40 year marriage his response was spot on -- a short but well done scene.Then we have the couple who are slated to adopt the child.  Jason Bateman as the prospective dad does an incredible job of showing his immaturity and self-centeredness.  His reaction when Juno calls him old and rejects him is truly excellent since so much of it is in his expression and body language.  Every single actor in this film did an outstanding job and Ellen Page and Michael Cera were the best I have seen in any movie this year.The camera work was excellent as was the direction.  The scene with the freight train was very symbolic and beautifully done just as the scene where Bateman bolts down the stairs to see Juno.  No words were needed -- great direction.I loved this movie but much of it hit too close to my youth and it left me sort of depressed even though it has a semi-happy ending.  I don't think this is a movie suitable for young children but I think it is wonderful for teens.  This is a great movie and should be a candidate for best movie.  I gave it 5 stars and it deserves every one of them.",Juno

Darren McGavin played the older brother type Martin character. Whereas Lewis hammed it up as the Delinquent who turned into a rookie cop.The Nutty Professor-Lewis comedic retelling of Dr Jekyll and Me Hyde. Dr Kelp was trying to create a youth formula, he created Buddy Love (a send up of Martin). Stella Steven as Miss Purdy is great in this role.Directed by Lewis, this film is a classic. Listen to the commentary track where Lewis and his friend Steve Lawrence banter about what this film wasThe Family Jewels-Lewis directed this film with a script by Bill Richmond and Jerry. A rich young girl's father died. The court asks her to pick who she wants to live with from her six uncles. Lewis plays all six uncles and the child's body guard.  I love the commentary track of this DVD. You can hear the insights as writer and director Lewis explain himselfCinderfella-A male version of the Cinderella story with Lewis playing the Cinderfella role. One of the high lights is Ed Wynn as his fairy godfather. Written and directed by Ex-Warner Brother animator Frank Tashlin, Fella (Lewis) is more fleshed out as a character than most of Lewis other characters.The Bellboy--The story behind the Bellboy according to the audio commentary was the director needed more time for Cinderfella. He told the studio give him 30 days. He was working doing his night club act in miami beach at the Fontainebleu. He wrote short visual gags with a silent Stanley the bellboy. There is also a running gag with writer/actor Bill Richmond playing a Stan Laurel character. There is no plot in the bellboy, but you will be entertained/ Also this is a Milton Berle cameo that is funny.Most of these films have Lewis and actor/singer Steve Lawrence commentraies. Then Banter like two old friends talking about movies and you are just sitting at the table with them. When watch this over the film, the commentary give you better insight into what Lewis the filmmaker is all about. You can take film school or you will listen to these commentaries track and you will learn just the same.There is a lot of archive materials on these DVD. Everything from trailers to outtakes, it is worth it for any film buffsWith these films, You can see why the French consider Lewis a comedy legend.

A well done ""kids movie"" can be ""ageless.""  That being said, the producers of ""Quest for Camelot"" didn't have a clear idea of the target audience: going from ridiculously extreme childishness in some parts, to other parts in which the humor is likely only going to be appreciated by adults familiar with old-time R-rated movies.  Now, that may be forgivable, but...Using five-star ""Mulan"" as the standard, ""Quest for Camelot"" lacks quality in so many areas.  The animation itself is poorer, the story rather less uplifting, the soundtrack more raw.

1137388,"I didn't feel that Crusoe (the waterhorse) was the main character of this movie.  He felt very incidental through a lot of it.  Like he was there just to play a bit part so the real main characters could have epiphanies.  Which is sad, because he and Churchill (the dog) had more personality than most of the human cast!I will say that this movie was far sadder and more depressing than I would have imagined.  Those looking for feel-good Disney fluff should turn away now.  There's not a whole lot of happy in this movie.  It has a very dark, depressing feel to it despite some of the more lighthearted moments (mostly starring Crusoe and Churchill).  The ending was oh so predictable, leaving me with a 'why did I bother' sort of feeling.  In fact, the movie as a whole left me flat.

750146,"Whenever I think of MASH, I think of this season, mostly because it went in directions that changed the show forever. The Hot Lips/Burns relationship went away, as did the character of Burns. It produced some great moments but it never felt quite right. Larry Linville (may he rest in peace) played Frank Burns brilliantly and it was always great to have him and Hot Lips on the same team. And Hot Lips was no longer Hot Lips. She went from the funny army clown to the unfunny serious army nurse. She became boring, as did a lot of the others on the show.To me, the show lost a lot of its comedy after season three, but it was still very good. After Larry Linville left, it really departed quite a bit from the show it had been. It became very preachy and more of a drama than a comedy. In fact, the laughs were very hard to come by after this season.I like Season Five and I do recommend it but I think the show suffered from the events that took place and it never regained the form it had early on.",N/A
760938,"Boogeyman 2 is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original film. Granted, that's not saying much. The original Boogeyman was a rather bland spook-fest about a supernatural Boogeyman that lived in children's closets. Boogeyman 2 is as different from the original as Halloween 3: Season of the Witch was different from the other entries in that series. Now I'm going to do something that I've never done before in one of my DVD reviews and give readers a spoiler alert. I'm doing so because I think it's necessary to totally separate Boogeyman 2 from its predecessor.Two children, Henry and younger sister Laura, are traumatized when they see their parents murdered. Ten years later, Henry is leaving a mental hospital, apparently cured of his phobia of the dark and ready to move on with his life. However, his sister is still terrified of the Boogeyman and decides to voluntarily check into the same facility that treated her brother. There she meets a group of patients, all coping with various phobias such as bulimic Nicky who fears gaining weight, germophobe Paul, agoraphobic Darren, and Alison whose condition causes her to cut herself. The group is all under the care of Dr. Allen, played by Saw veteran Tobin Bell, and his assistant Dr. Jessica Ryan. Ryan is played by Renee O' Connor who is best known for her role As Gabrielle in Xena: Warrior Princess.Soon after Laura arrives, patients start to die. Laura is convinced that the Boogeyman has followed her to the hospital but Dr. Allen insists it's there is no Boogeyman and it's just her fear that she has to face. Boogeyman 2 has only the most tenuous tie to the first film as we learn that the main character was also treated by Dr. Allen. Now, here's the little spoiler alert and I think astute horror fans will figure this out very early on...This is not a supernatural tale like the first one but a good ol' fashioned slasher that is far more effective in its execution than the recent, over-hyped Hatchet.  Director Jeff Betancourt has succeeded in giving fans an 80's-style slasher film with a young, good looking cast, trapped in a creepy hospital, and stalked by a killer. The kills are gory, yet stylishly conceived and original. Each of the patients meets their end in a way that befits their particular fears.Danielle Savre is quite good in her performance as Laura. She's the requisite horror film heroine, terrified yet resourceful enough to stay alive. Tobin Bell only seems to have one expression no matter what role he's playing but he does bring a certain sinister quality to the film.The effects and gore are very well done, far better than one would expect from a direct-to-DVD sequel. While his was Betancourt's first directorial effort, he's not stranger to horror films, having worked as editor on The Grudge, The Grudge 2, When a Stranger Calls, and The Exorcism of Emily Rose.  He's learned his craft well. The scenery was dark, but not so dark that you could not see what was happening onscreen.Now, it's not all perfect. The film stretches the limits of logic quite a bit. We are to believe that this large facility is staffed by only two doctors and one nurse. There's no security, no maintenance, and the only orderly is fired near the beginning of the film. The doors are controlled through the phone system and when the phones go down, everyone is trapped inside. Somehow I'm thinking that a lack of emergency exits would not be up to building and fire safety codes. So yes, the film does ask the viewer to suspend a bit of belief. If you can do that, this turns out to be one gem of a slasher!",N/A

The visuals are spectacular, the suspense builds and you jump in your seat a few times too. Just the right number of people die so as it doesn't add up to a predictable fantasy where everyone is saved in the end. The only problem was the ending with the learning to surf scene. After all the panic and trauma on the plane, it seemed cheesy, falsely-sentimental and gooey and as if the whole snake drama had never happened. Also they leave a lot of questions unanswered which is kind of annoying.If you love plane drama movies then this is surely for you.

89005,"It's difficult to look back on a film ""classic"" and try to review it through today's eyes...35 years later.  It's always tempting to say, ""Those effects were great...for 1973"" or ""imagine how that affected an audience...three decades ago.""  You almost feel like you have to make excuses for the film.But I am happy to report that in a very recent, pre-Halloween viewing, THE EXORCIST has withstood the test of time nearly unscathed.  Yes, some of the effects (there are actually fewer than you would expect) are not up to the standards of today.  The clothing is often hilariously tacky.  Technology is primitive.Yet William Friedkin's classically styled direction of William Peter Blatty's effectively unsettling novel still has the uncanny ability to give us the creeps today.  Often (VERY often) imitated, but not yet equaled, THE EXORCIST is simply brilliant.If you don't know the story:  young Regan (Linda Blair, before she was the punchline to a lot of cheap jokes) lives in a lovely Washington DC home with her recently divorced movie-actress mother (Ellen Burstyn).  They are a well-to-do little family, with a housekeeper, cook & nanny.  But they are presented as a loving pair.Soon, though, Regan begins to exhibit strange behavior, including rather vivid tales of her talks with ""imaginary"" friends she clearly believes are real.  Her mother begins taking her to doctors and specialists, who at first assume it's just adolescence.  Then Regan's behavior starts getting worse, and frankly, a bit hard to explain.  It's when she starts talking in strange voices and levitating from her bed that all rational explanations begin to go out the window.I describe this, I admit, in a fairly flippant way.  But it does NOT come across as cheesy or ironic or with a wink.  It's played dead straight, and is presented almost like a medical procedural story.  Something you'd see on a much calmer episode of HOUSE.  Rational people, trying to come up with reasonable explanations, until, chillingly, they are all forced to throw up their hands in despair.  And no one is despairing more than Burstyn, who has seen her daughter cursing in a deep voice, levitating herself and her bed, thrashing in violent seizures, with cuts developing on her face.  Regan also, quite disturbingly, abuses herself with a cross.  Yes, that scene has been made fun of MANY times over the years...but seeing it proves that the original has lost none of its impact.  It is a queasy and startling moment.Meanwhile, some strange things have been doing on in the local Catholic Churches, and priest/psychologist Father Karras (Jason Miller) is trying explain these happenings, while also dealing with guilt over his elderly (soon to be dead) mother AND his loss of faith.  These scenes also have a matter-of-fact, non-exploitative feeling...as though we're watching a ""normal"" drama about a religious man floundering in his duties.Eventually, mother Burstyn turns to Father Karras for help.  She's convinced her daughter needs an exorcism.  Karras, who not only personally doesn't believe in exorcism but also knows the church is HIGHLY skeptical of them too, agrees reluctantly to visit Regan.  He is horrified by what he sees, but for awhile, he searches for rational explanations too.  Yet, eventually, he must turn to ""legendary"" Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), a priest who has actually performed such a ritual.ALSO, there has been a mysterious death of a friend of Burstyn's and Detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating, giving the movie the feel of an old-fashioned detective story.I've rehashed a lot of the plot, first to remind you of its intricacies (but hopefully not spoiling much) but also to emphasize how much this movie is NOT presented as a horror film.  It is shown as anything but, frankly, for much of its running time.  This serves only to make the horror more effective because it seems so incredibly PLAUSIBLE.  When it's all done, we can look back and realize that the basic sketch of the horrible things that happen isn't too original.  It's the CONTEXT in which they play out that works so well.In many ways, we come to ""believe"" Regan is possessed just as Father Karras does.  He's a doubter who is FORCED to believe, because no other explanation will serve.  The movie is a ""horror-procedural"" or a ""demonic detective story.""  It is creepy as hell, too!By the time this stately paced film reaches its final 20 minute or so, we are pretty much wrung out.  Regan's room has become an ice-cold bastion of evil.  The fear and the chill are palpable to the viewer.  And even though I knew the outcome, I was riveted to the film...stunned that I was still able to be creeped out even on my 4th viewing.  The film is constructed so well and with no hint of irony.  It is dead serious.  Friedkin took, frankly, the exactly correct approach to the material, and it paid off.  The script is first-rate, as well.Best of all, we've got a cast of fantastic actors playing their juicy roles completely seriously.  Ellen Burstyn occasionally drifts to the hammy side towards the end (as she so often does) but only slightly.  Linda Blair is fearsome effective...even with the help of makeup and the voice of Mercedes McCambridge, she is a striking figure.  Lee J. Cobb was a fantastic actor (the original Willy Loman) and has been sadly missed for many years.  His Det. Kinderman is a small role, but he brings a touch to it that gives the film a whiff of humor.  Max Von Sydow is an imposing figure...he's done many, many great performances since...but his work here is what he'll be most remembered for (at least by American audiences).  Finally, Jason Miller is dead perfect as Father Karras, who to me is the true heart-and-soul of this film.  It is HIS personal journey that most gives this film gravitas.  Miller was a very talented actor and writer.  His performance ranks right up there with other greats of that era of the `70s when Method actors like Pacino and deNiro were making their big marks.  I suspect that had he not been so reluctant to do film work,  he could have been one of the greats as well.By all means, see THE EXORCIST again.  I believe you'll be as pleasantly surprised as me.  And if by some chance you have NOT seen it...do yourself a favor.  There's a reason this film is deemed a classic...and it is not a ""stuffy old"" film that doesn't  hold up today.I saw the DVD that comes with some restored scenes.  Most of the scenes were not needed (a lot more stuff with Father Merrin wandering around the middle east)...but there were a few brief moments with Von Sydow and Burstyn near the end that were quite good...plus a VERY brief but unforgettable shot of Regan coming down some stairs in a very unconventional way.",N/A
1129378,"A unique and special part of silent cinema was the German Expressionist style of the 1920s which is characterized by the emphasis on emotions conveyed by atmospheric lighting and expressive acting, as opposed to what we might call `realism'.  Although ""The Hands of Orlac"" is technically an Austrian production, the country is so closely related to Germany that it features a mainly German cast and crew, and all the typical characteristics of the classic German Expressionist style.  Scenes have strong shadows or lighting to emphasize moods, and are usually drawn out to allow the actors to fully express emotions, but there are also moments of realism such as a very convincing train wreck site, as well as the fast-moving climax which brings everything back down to earth.  Throughout most of this nearly 2-hour-length film, an eerie modern orchestral score contributes to the somewhat other-worldly feeling of the whole story, which revolves around the concept of transplanted hands taking over their new host with characteristics of the hands' original owner.  This fascinating idea comes from a French writer of the early 1900s when such Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror stories captured the imagination of many Europeans, and with the advent of moving pictures, they became perfect material for the German Expressionist style, of which ""Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" and ""Nosferatu"" are just some of the most famous examples.Besides the artistic element of using light and shadow, the highlight for me personally is Conrad Veidt's magnificent performance as Orlac, the concert pianist who receives the hands of a convicted murderer after being injured in a train wreck.  This role is by far the most intensely expressive and emotion-packed performance I've seen by Veidt, and he carries the suspenseful energy of the story right through the entire film.  More than just artistic expression however, ""The Hands of Orlac"" has a clever murder mystery theme running through it as well which deserves a little careful attention to fully appreciate.  With excellent picture quality and very suitable music, this DVD is further enhanced with some bonus features including detailed notes with background information on the film and its cast and crew, as well as a trailer for its equally gripping 1935 sound remake ""Mad Love"" with Peter Lorre.  Needless to say, ""The Hands of Orlac"" deserves its place alongside the best-known German silent classics, and it has been worth the wait to see the full length restored version released by Kino Video.",The Hands of Orlac
907842,"They Are Among Us (Jeffrey Obrow, 2004)Oh, yes, it's true-- they are among us. What are ""they"", you ask? They are bad filmmakers. And the Sci-Fi Channel snatches them up and gives them an outlet for their terrible, terrible offerings. I had some hope for this one, which has a pretty solid stable of B-movie and TV staples (Nana Visitor, Corbin Bernsen, Alison Eastwood, Bruce Boxleitner, Hunter Tylo-- yes, Hunter Tylo!), but let's face it-- this is godawful in every sense.The story: a small town in Anywhere, America is hiding a host of aliens. Some of the town's kids find out about it. Of course, the alien invasion must be stopped! Except that, well, you know, they're already here.The script had some great ideas; unfortunately, it does as little as possible with them. (Who thinks up a colony of aliens having a plastic surgeon on retainer? That's brilliant.) Worse, it seems to be trying to be as confusing as possible for the first hour; worse still, once the confusion is (somewhat) alleviated by Obrow tying the threads together, things get only marginally less confusing. The question is, though, do you want to understand what's going on by this point in the movie? You're probably better off staying confused. *",They Are Among Us
218134,"My wife and I saw this wonderful movie on DVD last night for the very first time, eventhough we are both old enough to have seen it in a movie theater in the 50s. The storyline has been explained many times here, so I'll not go into it again. Audrey Hepburn was simply beautiful and played the role perfectly of a princess wanting to live a ""normal"" life and do all of the things she wanted to do, dreamed of doing, for just one entire day. Peck was typically restrained as the man who wanted that one BIG SCOOP to further his career as a newspaperman and land himself his dream of working in New York City. Her dreams come true and is surprised to find love among them, if only for twenty-four hours, he sacrifices his dream of being a star reporter for love of her.This was the perfect movie for two romantics who are generally unimpressed with today's lifeless actors, four-letter-word infused dialog, and plotless movies. Highly recommended.",N/A
649765,"Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return once again in this third installment of the Spiderman series.Maguire revives his role as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  Peter's life is going very well; he's doing well in school and his relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) couldn't be better.  Plus, he's just saved the police chief's daughter from certain death.  Now, he's being awarded the key to the city.  Life couldn't be much better, right?  Wrong!Harry Osborne (Franco) still blames Spiderman for the death of his father.  So, Harry's taken on a persona of his own as the New Goblin.  He and Spiderman fight it out over New York, but Spiderman managed to knock Harry off of his futuristic surfboard.  Harry ends up in the hospital with a loss of memory.  For the moment, Harry doesn't remember anything of his encounter with Spiderman, and he and Peter become friends again (or so it seems).Peter learns more about the death of his uncle.  He finds out that the man who was arrested for the killing was not the killer at all.  The real killer turns out to be Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church).  He escapes from prison and flees from the police, but something happens to him as he's fleeing.  He runs into some sort of physics lab where his bodily chemistry is altered.  He can now assume shapes in the sand and turns once again to crime.  He and Spiderman have several run-ins, and he's given the name Sandman.Peter is also going through changes of his own.  Some symbiotic being has attached itself to Peter's Spiderman suit.  It gives him a new sense of strength and power, but it also takes its toll on Peter mentally.  He's become stronger, but he's also become more abrasive and brash.  Mary Jane has noticed the change in Peter, and she's feeling more distanced from him.  Mary Jane decides to visit Harry, and they share a kiss.  Mary Jane runs from the house, but the kiss has triggered Harry's memory.  He again goes searching for Spiderman.  The two fight it out, and Spiderman leaves Harry for dead.Another enemy for Spiderman emerges in this film.  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is a new reporter selling pictures to Peter's newspaper.  J.J. Jameson likes Eddie's pictures better than Peter's and tells Eddie if he can find a picture of Spiderman ""with his hands in the cookie jar"", he'll get the open reporter position on the paper.  Eddie submits a picture to J.J. of Spiderman holding a bag of money in front of a bank, and J.J. gives him the job.  Peter finds out and claims that the picture is a fake.  The paper finds out that the picture is indeed a fake, and Eddie is fired.  He vows revenge against Peter.  Eddie goes to church and hears noises from the bell tower.  The noise is Peter trying to rid himself of the symbiote.  The symbiote falls on Eddie and soon, he has transformed into Venom; a villian intent on destroying Spiderman.Soon, Sandman and Venom have teamed up in an effort to destroy Spiderman.  Eddie has captured Mary Jane and placed her 80 stories above the ground inside a taxi cab.  Peter sees the events unfolding on television and goes to help.  He first stops at Harry's house to ask for his help, but Harry doesn't give in (by this time, Harry's butler has told him the truth about his father's death).  So, Spiderman goes off to fight the two  villains alone.  Will Mary Jane survive?  Will Harry come to help Spiderman?I thought this was the best of the Spiderman movies so far.  The acting is great and its always nice to have the same actors continue with their roles in sequels.  There is a lot of action and characters to keep track of in this movie, but everything is tied up at the end.  The ending leaves the door wide open for a fourth installment, which I'm sure will be coming soon.I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and see if Spiderman can defeat the new villians as well as the enemy within himself.",Spider-Man 3

782190,"I've known about this film for quite some time now , it has garnered an infamous place in zombie movie lore partially  because of the appearance of Bill Hinzman , Zombie number 1 in the original Notld .He not only plays the lead zombie in this film , but he manages to wear three other hats for this production , that of producer , director and editor .At first , this venture reeks of someone trying to capitalize on their cult classic stature and of someone ripping off a genuine classic . Although i admit that it borrows heavily from the original Night , it has a mind and an enthusiasm for the genre all it's own .The blood flows freely in this , they didn't seem to hold back when it came to the grue that fans of these films enjoy , it's in abundance here and most of it is excellent . There are some moments when the budget with regards to the makeup fx becomes obvious , but overall , kudos to the makeup crew , more of the "" gags "" work than don't . And for them to fashion such effective fx on an obviously small budget is more of a revelation . We have death by pitchfork , numerous headshots , noses being bitten off , a hook in a leg , burnt bodies , it's all here , and for people who love z grade horror films and exploitation , you'll enjoy yourself immensely with this .I was surprised at the amount of zombies that were in this film , because i've read some reviews about how there is hardly any to speak of , let me put your apprehension to rest , there are plenty to go around , especially in the bravura final 30 minutes . Now , granted , the zombie makeup is admittedly sub par , but the excellent gore fx and the amount of zombie action more than make up for it , it's a minor deficiency that didn't bother me at all .Then for you cheap Italian exploitation film fans , there is gratuitous nudity . yes this is an American production , but with the amount of skin on display , you would think you were watching a Fulci film , if anything this has more flesh on display than some of those films .If that isn't enough , the acting is overall atrocious , overacting , underacting , non acting , it's all here , and the film is dubbed for some reason , adding to that cheap Italian horror movie atmosphere even more . Some the dialog is classic , and i wouldn't doubt if the makers of Shaun of the Dead stole a scene right out of this film . Oh boy , there are some groan inducing lines spouted in this film , but i loved it all the more because of it , it was endearing .I have to mention that there is just about one musical track that plays for almost the entire film , and it's too good for a film such as this , but i'm glad it's here , it makes everything seem more menacing , it creates an appropriately suspenseful tone even in light of all of the silliness .I highly recommend this hidden gem , it delivers on all fronts in the zombie genre . It may be somewhat derivative , but it does what it set out to do , and that was entertain like only a z grade zombie movie can when done "" right "" . BH has made his own little legend , because this thing is a classic now in my opinion .I wouldn't buy the single disc though , it's a bit expensive , i would buy the zombie pack 2 , it will only work out to about 6 dollars or so and you'll get two other films in the package .

I judge movies on whether I'll ever want to watch them again, and I would see 27 Dresses a few more times. Katherine Heigl is good at playing her title role, and James Marsden does light up the screen as the love interest, but... there is some heart missing.

2938,"""Up yours with a splintered fiddle!""The Car is the Quintessential mid 70's monster movie, it's man verses thing done in such a way that it could only have come out in that tiny window of great transition in American cinema. Finally dead was the last golden era of Hollywood where the directors had free reign, killed by a social culture that no longer wanted to do much more then cheer for a winner. The shame of Watergate, and Vietnam had caused the thinking persons film to become little more then an afterthought while a world of escapist fantasy took over the pulse of American movie going culture. The three nails in the coffin were Rocky, Jaws, and then finally Star Wars as a coup de grass. The car rose out of these ashes not so much as a phoenix, but more as a mocking bird emulating the staggeringly successful plot points of Jaws tooth and nail, up to and including a climatic finish in which a giant fire devil envelopes the sky when the car explodes at the ending. The big problem of course is that the fear of sharks is a very universal primal fear shared by all of man kind across the globe, whereas demonic driverless cars is probably a fear shared by a mere handful of souls on Earth, and even these people would be mentally fragile to say the least. Nonetheless, The Car has just enough atmosphere and quirky charm that it remains til this day, a highly entertaining film to watch. Now in rating a film like this one, it is best to realise exactly what it is going in. You should not rate it along side cinematic masterpieces like Ben Herr, The Godfather, or Gandhi. The Car is a pure straight line horror film in which the monster is the main character, and outside of the obvious heroic alpha male lead, we get to sit back and watch all the other side characters get taken out one by one. It is therefor a film that unpretentiously aspires to be nothing beyond pure bubble-gum, and as such, the taunt 92 minutes is peppered with 13 deaths, giving the viewer the enjoyment of watching an average of one person get ran down every seven minutes. Along with all this fast paced action, there is some painfully funnly looking sped up Laurel and Hardy like car chase footage, kooky characters with silly dialog, really aweful looking high waist polyester pants, and a Marshall drumming saturated soundtrack which barrows its main melody from Hector Berlioz Symphony Fantastic. ( Just like with The Shining ) The main things going for this movie are the great New Mexico desert location, the use of great character actors like R.G. Armstrong, and Ronny Cox, but mostly, the coolest looking car ever put on film. The Car itself uses the body of a black 60's Lincoln Continental with a cropped and lowered roof, dingy orange tinted windows, and a rounded two fanged bumper that looks like it was lifted off of a 1930's pick-up truck. Unfortunately the US version of The Car is quit pricey, that is why I suggest getting a zone-free DVD player and buying the British copy of the film which plays on PAL 2,4,&5 signals. I own this British copy myself and can testify that the picture quality looks great. Since films like The Car, The Stepfather, Hardware, Innocence, Last House on Dead Ends Street, Santa Sangre etc. either cost too much to own an American copy of, or flat out do not exist in NTSC, owning a region-free DVD player is a must for any discerning film lover. Finally I suggest watching The Car with Race With The Devil as a double bill, or to play The Car at any gathering including as background footage at a party.P.S. Is it just me or does The Car's silliest acting performer, Kathleen Lloyd, have a rather uncanny resemblance to Sarah Silverman?",N/A
821215,"Having praised the first season, I must say, that while the show is still very good, the second season is not as good as the first season.  My overall sense is that the powers that be unfortunately saw only one thing in their very powerful show: the ""chemistry"" between Peta Wilson (Nikita) and Roy Dupuis (Michael).  In many respects season two is a repeat of season one, only with the focus on Roy's character, Michael.  Yes, the stories are different, but the themes and statements about relationships are the same.  As openly stated in the commentaries, they producers/staff were focusing on the ""sexual tension"" that Roy and Peta engendered in their performances--a huge mistake, from my perspective, that nearly stalled the show.  Again, I feel that the best attribute of season one was that the show took a ""hard look at the realities of relationships mirrored by the microscopic world of Nikita."" Sadly, the second season failed to fully build on that foundation, and instead focused on ""teasing"" viewers with the never ending ""sexual tension.""  I personally did not care for the character reversals of Michael and Nikita; indeed, I often felt I was watching ""Le Femme Michael"" instead of Le Femme Nikita.  On the other hand, the second season did incorporate what I believe is referred to as a ""B story line;"" that is, the development of other characters in the Nikita environment: Operations, Madeline, Walter, and Birkoff.  In doing so, they introduced more varied forms of relationships that ultimately--and thankfully--saved the show.  In spite of my stated ""problems"" with the second season, overall the second season still provided outstanding performances, and many of my comments about the first season hold true for the second season.Please keep in mind that I never saw the show on television, and, therefore, my observations are based upon viewing the episodes from the DVD box set.  As for ""missing"" extras or other ""problems"" other reviewers have found with the quality of the DVDs, I again must state that this is a late 1990s show made on a small budget and packaging/description errors do happen.  Conversely, I would agree that it would be nice to hear a commentary or two by Peta Wilson; but, in the final analysis, it is the opportunity to watch an outstanding television show--sans ads--that is most important.",La Femme Nikita: The Complete Second Season

303956,"It is impossible to defend everything Thelma and Louise did as events unraveled.  Never mind illegalities; some of their misdeeds were deliberate and just plain wrong.However, I consistently wanted them to make it.  If Louise was not going to turn her back on Thelma, then neither was I.  Louise was the brains behind the outfit.  Thelma was naive and less-than-intelligent, and she cost Louise dearly many times.  No one could have blamed Louise for letting Thelma go in hopes that she (Lousie) could still make it.Louise's love and friendship for Thelma turned out to be more fierce than her instinct for survival.  Who wouldn't want to be on their team?Another compelling thing about this film is the go-for-broke mentality.  As their situations deteriorate, they start pushing boundaries and limits in ways that most of us never will.  It becomes impossible to look away.If you have only ever watched this on cable, you should rent this film at least once to see the missing scene between the stranded desert cop and the Rastafarian.  It offers comic relief in a tale laced with desperation.  By the way, the cop was played by the actor that portrayed Demi Moore's boyfriend in GI Jane.Michael Madsen (Virginia's brother) would have been tempting for a lot of us girls.

1169000,"I own several yoga DVDs and greatly appreciate the benefits yoga brings - better sense of balance, improved flexibility, ability to handle stress and to relax more. Yoga is something that every human could draw from, if they could only find a half hour each day to dedicate to its practice.Yoga AM PM gives you that ability. You get two quick routines - one for the morning, one for the evening, and neither one is a high challenge. Both are routines that the most basic of people could give a try and find success with. The instructor does a great job of offering options. If you can't touch your toes, reach for your thighs instead. If you can't fold flat, fold partially. She is always instructing you to take your time, to be patient, to go at your own pace. Yoga is not a competition. It is about stretching your own personal horizons.The landscape is beautiful - flowers, ocean - but really, after the first watch or two you aren't looking at the TV at all. You are immersed in your own practice, listening to her voice, going through the moves in your own space. I greatly appreciate that they filmed it in a ""pretty place"" but in the overall scheme of things that isn't as important as the vocal quality. They did an awesome job in both areas so I think people with either type of orientation will be happy.I do wish there was more here. Most DVDs I own have multiple tracks, with a wide variety of routines to work through. Here you only have two. AM. PM. That's it. I really think for a DVD they should have had more information. If nothing else, as this is for beginners, they should have had some sort of an ""intro track"" that explained what downward facing dog, child's pose, etc. really were all about. I have done yoga for a while so when the instructor says ""go up into downward facing dog"" I don't think about it, I simply do it. If someone really was a true beginner and grabbed this DVD to get started, they would have no idea what was being asked of them. I definitely do thing a track of ""intro to yoga"" and then another track of ""the basic moves and information about each one"" would be quite warranted here.So that is my caveat. If you really are a beginner, sit and watch the DVD a few times without actually trying it, to see what she is doing and get an understanding for the poses. Once you understand what she is asking you to do, then give it a shot in time with her and start doing the practice. I do very much like the routines she does, and like the background and soundtrack. I just wish they used the ample space available on the DVD to provide more information to those seeking it.",Element: AM & PM Yoga for Beginners

Sounds like someone is trying to cash in on a name to me. But for some reason, I still pre-ordered it, for $10 mind you. Then the early reviews starting rolling in, and they basically called it a disaster. My expectations went from low to nonexistent in a heartbeat. So it comes in the mail and I watch it, here's the formula: Take the original Lost Boys, keep this one pretty much the same, but add more gore and sex. Next, take out the really cool soundtrack and replace it with a really bad one. Then replace the cool vampires with really lame Buffy vampires who play too many video games and emulate Jackass. Sprinkle in some bad acting and a borderline annoying female lead, and you have Lost Boys: The Tribe. All that being said, it really wasn't that bad, calling it an average movie is being a little generous but I will leave it as such. It's insulting to have this movie bear the Lost Boys name, because it does not have nearly the same heart or atmosphere. But as a vampire movie, you're looking at a mediocre horror version of Laguna Beach, or the OC or some other equally horrible show. I can not solidly recommend it, but I can say that it does have some nice gore and Corey Feldman does a nice job as Edgar Frog. Remember how he was in the original? Cheesy and fun? Same thing here, good job Corey. And revealing anything else would be a spoiler.

1056397,"Jacob Bronowski, unusually for an academic, performs admirably as a television presenter.  He is charming, persuasive, and intimate as he conveys the gradual forward-march of scientific understanding from pre-history through to his own period at the end of the sixth decade of the twentieth century.  He handles complex subjects and trains of events by reducing them to their essentials without undue simplification, and he shows how social factors have so often influenced the development (or conversely the stultification) of science.  He conjures up moments in time, important personages, and vital ideas with a few well-chosen words and he is gently passionate in his art of persuasion.  For anyone wanting an encapsulation of scientific thought since Euclid, this series is worth every penny for that alone.Yet it is more.  Bronowski is above all else a humanist, deeply concerned about the way in which knowledge liberates mankind from suspicion, error, and confusion.  In his personal view, the ascent of man is an ascent from ignorance towards understanding, and from actions ruled by dogma and fear to actions guided by reason and tolerance.  This is an idealist's series of programs aimed above all else at encouraging the viewer to consider life more carefully and in consequence act more thoughtfully.As such, of course, it can aspire but perhaps not succeed.  One of the most revealing moments in the series is when Bronowski talks about evolutionary theory being completely accepted and no longer argued over.  He could make that statement in 1971 but in 2008 it is untrue.  In the opening of the 1970s Bronowski was worried about the post-hippy tendency towards vague mysticism and escapist fantasy.  Some forty years on, the world is a much worse place for humanists than he could ever have imagined.  The intellectual life of the USA has been addled by bigoted mythologists and Islam has become a pejorative term through association with barbaric terrorism.  Academic discourse in the west has long since been hijacked by irrelevant idealogues preaching illiterate nonsense and the rest of the world lacks almost entirely any domain in which thought may run free.  Clearly the ascent of man is far from being a linear process and it is entirely possible that our dazzling inventions will ultimately be the cause of our demise as a species.  We have mastered the art of fire, but we have not acquired the cast of mind necessary to use it wisely.From a technical perspective there are several irritations: far too many sequences of pictures with awful music, really bad artwork and worse ties, poor sound quality and grainy video quality.  But ultimately none of that matters.  We do not disparage Thucydides' writings on the Peloponnesian War because the parchments on which they were transmitted are now yellowed and cracked with age.  We do not dicount Newton's masterful account of a clockwork universe because his handwriting was awkward and his terminology somewhat obscure.  And so the technical imperfections and stylistic infelicities of this series should not interpose themselves between us and our deep appreciation of this unique work.  It is sadly quite unimaginable that any equivalent set of programs could be made today.  Our age is darker than Bronowski's time and so we shall not see its successor.",N/A
1134776,"B&eacute;atrice Dalle of ""Betty Blue"" fame (she gouged out an eye in that psycho-naturel masterpiece) goes deep red in this film. At first, she is a creepy apparition. Then she is a roaming intruder who looks like the Grim Reaper's twisted sister. Finally, she is a one-woman gore fest. Neither stock suspenser nor senseless slasher flick nor gratuitous torture porn, ""A l'int&eacute;rieur"" (""Inside"" - neither the French title nor its perfect English translation is very effective, however accurate) incorporates all of these basic elements of the horror genre in a fresh and very disturbing way. If you like your horror intense, this film will not disappoint. It builds up to a riveting climax, avoids the anti-climax like the plague, and closes quickly in a very satisfying and brutally honest way, with just a dash of ironic and totally unexpected pathos for the killer, who has blessed us with never a Dalle moment!",Inside
234711,"Any film starring the great Kirk Douglas is usually good and often great.  YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN is no exception.  Douglas does an o.k. job portraying the pseudo Bix Beiderbecke character, Rick Martin, but he just can't mimic a trumpet player that well (lip positions,breathing, [...] etc.)  The film follows a typical Hollywood mellodrama style, a guy struggling, succeeding, descending into personal demons and then rescue by a gal or a self realiztion.  The real star of this film is the brilliant soundtrack by the incomparable Harry James with the equally brilliant Doris Day handling the vocals.  I am now waiting for a good biofilm of Harry James as his life covered all the aspects of a rags to riches drama in addition to some of the best music ever recorded.",Young Man With a Horn VHS

Robert Downey Jr. lays down a great performance that easily ranks as one of the best ever in this genre of film. He is funny, smart, cool and just a unique individual. The supporting cast from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeff Bridges are in fine form as well. The main reason I loved this movie so much was the fact that the cheese factor was very low (more like Batman than the cheese heavy Spiderman), not to mention all the cool tech gadgets. The CGI is only used when needed and looks realistic.My entire sold out theater went crazy throughout the movie and I must admit I even did at times.

1160381,"When I bought this movie, I didn't quite know what to expect.  MISS PETTIGREW is one of those movies that if it did come to the theaters in rural Alabama, I probably would not have gone to see it because the theaters are reserved for ""blockbusters.""  A look at the box shows no comment from a critic that I have grown to know and respect, I was curious about how Amy Adams and Frances McDormand would interact, and I found a perfectly delightful movie.This is the type of movie that when one writes about it, it is difficult not to give away ""spoilers,"" but on the other side of the coin, it is fairly predictable in that you ""know"" in your heart where it should probably go, but you are somewhat surprised by two things that happen along the way:1)  The performances.  Wonderful!  There was an indication or two that Frances McDormand, as Miss Pettigrew, was fighting an urge within herself on just how much to show of an emotion, a difficulty that some actors, have when they are both competent on the stage and screen, but that could, also, be a problem that was more the director's fault. Of all of the performances, only Shirley Henderson playing Edythe Dubarry was quite annoying, which grated me; however, her character was supposed to be annoying, which given some of her previous roles, ""Moaning Myrtle"" in the Harry Potter movies, is perhaps a type-casting she should be concerned about receiving.2)  The characters.  The writing was so skillful that you knew the characters, the good and the bad, before you met them.  The ""over-the-top"" performance of Amy Adams as Delysia Lafosse (""Enchanted"") and ""low-keyed"" performance of Ms. McDormand were as balanced as the Ying and Yang symbols on an Asian scarf, designed by Joe Blumfield, nonetheless.  Seldom do you see a movie where the characters ""fit"" the acting, or is that vise-versa and the acting ""fit"" the characters.  Whatever the case, the characters are well developed.So, why 5-Stars?  I mean is this ""Casablanca,"" one of the few movies that I have ever given a 5-Star rating?  No, but MISS PETTIGREW is one of those movies that is fun, enjoyable to watch over-and-over for ""things"" one missed the first time, and at the same time, it provides several life lessons.  I would probably have given this a 4.5-Stars, but there is no such animal, at least here, and giving it 5-Stars, maybe, just maybe, someone out there, who really likes movies, and really enjoys very good performances will see the ""5-Stars"" and take a chance and have a nice one hour and thirty-two minutes watching this delightful movie.",N/A
1041548,"This is a gem, an early '90s series with episodes based on true events.  The ""true events"" are often questionable urban myths, or off the mark representations of non-mainstream religions, but there is no question that this series is worth watching.  The acting stands up to the test of time, with writing that fits a complete storyline into each episode.  Season one is 22 episodes, which harkens back to a time when no one would call 12 episodes of a show a ""season"".  Shari Belafonte and Carl Marotte do a great job portraying the main characters: Laura Wingate a parapsychologist; and J. J. Stillman, a clinical psychologist; as a university's Parapsychology department.  Their characters mesh well, and balance each other while pursuing the validity and cause of each episode's supernatural focus.  Nicole deBoer joins the cast later in the season.Some of the clothing - and a lot of the technology - screams late 80s to the early '90s.  Still, the portrayals of everyday folks seeking help in dealing with unusual events in their lives make for interesting viewing. Rather than using a narrator voicing the story in a somber voice, as is often done with more recent shows depicting the paranormal, Beyond Reality used talented actors to convey the eeriness of having day to day life disrupted by a supernatural event.  And did a very good job of it.  I'm looking forward to the next season of Beyond Reality being released on DVD.",Beyond Reality: Season 1

244271,"I'm not going into full detail about the movie. By now everyone knows it depicts the life of the last emperor of China during the 1900's. A century full of many evolutionary changes in society. One that says hello to the future and goodbye to old traditional ways. Of course the last emperor of China was a foolish ugly man with no actual control at all. He was just a puppet in died a lonely tragic life. But towards the end of his life he really did come full circle and was able to appreciate his existence even more during rehabilitation. Certain things in the film aren't mention such as the emperor being impotent. He shots blanks so there's no way he could have gotten his wife pregnant. Of course we know in the film that it's the driver who gets her pregnant. But it still should have been revealed that the emperor was impotent and incapable of having a child. I remember watching this movie on HBO way back in the 80's when i was a little kid and always felt a connection with the film. Every time it was on i just had to sit there and watch it in all its 3 hour plus glory. As i've gotten older i have only found even more appreciation for the film as i can understand certain parts better now that i am older. The ironic thing was that during the 80's when the film was released the emperor's real life brother was still alive and still might be alive today. One of my favorite parts of the film is that it was actually shot in the Forbidden City and isn't some fake sound stage. The costumes, music, and acting are beyond lush and on point. Even though I think John Lone who plays the emperor is gay in real life, but I digress. It shows the Chinese culture in a way that perhaps many Americans didn't know existed. This truly is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time and with each growing decade it will attract many new legions of fans. Of course this masterpiece was directed by a wonderful phenomenal director who i just adore and also have respect for a lot of his work. But this one is the one film that stands out the most on his resume of impressive films. Bernardo just pushes the envelope like no other director and is ok with racy topics. I am not a huge fan of drama films as they tend to be very dark and hard to watch. But as I mentioned this one is sooo different and really stands out from the crowd.

661412,"BLOOD: THE LAST VAMPIRE tells of the horrific events which took place in a U.S. military base in Japan, just before the Vietnam War. It seems that the populace of Yokota Air Base is unknowingly suffering from a series of vampire attacks. Unknowingly, because the victims then show up as suicide casualties. So in comes the mysterious Saya, who works in concert with a covert government agency in hunting down these vampires, which are actually blood-sucking demons called the Chiropterans. Posing as a high school girl, Saya begins to nose around the base's high school, even as everyone else prepares for the big Halloween bash. More the lethal slayer type than a detective, it still doesn't take too long before she and her samurai sword stumble into something...BLOOD: THE LAST VAMPIRE is a wicked cool anime, running at 48 minutes, which I like to pop in the player whenever I've got a dull hour to kill. This film, which came out in 2000, has a couple of things going for it. First off, the film looks amazing. The animation is absolutely state-of-the-art and about as seamless a marriage I have seen of 2D and 3D graphics. The film right away establishes an ominous mood, which it then refuses to relinquish, much credit to the brooding soundtrack. The action sequences are dynamite stuff, excitingly presented. From the moment the lights dimmed on the subway train and Saya exploded into action, I was friggin' wowwed. The shaky cam technique used at times during these action sequences is pretty effective. It doesn't hurt that the Chiropterans are imposing, scary looking things. To see a tiny high school looking girl tackle these beasties (and then relentlessly dispose of them) simply adds to the cool factor.Her handler claims that Saya is the ""only remaining original,"" and I guess he means she's the last vampire. But then the story doesn't delve into that very intriguing tidbit. I guess there just wasn't time for the film to drop some background 411 on Saya. What we do learn is that she's sullen and stoic and very determined. She's aggresively anti-religious. She's disdainful of people. But she carries out her missions with a grim relentlessness and a no-nonsense air. And, when she springs into action, she makes you forget that her character is pretty one-dimensional.There's really not much of a set-up. The film plants the viewer smack dab in the thick of the plot, which I kind of like since it lends a more pronounced sense of immediacy. The movie being only 48 minutes long doesn't really bother me, although, yes, that doesn't really give the movie a chance to develop the story or its characters, who do come off as shallow. The main characters seem to be Saya, the agent David, and a plump, good-hearted school nurse in peril. It's kind of refreshing that our surly heroine refuses to be solicitous of the very frightened nurse; instead, Saya gets extremely annoyed with her. That's our Saya!The brevity of the running time makes it seem more of an expanded episode to a series than an actual film. Then there are the unaswered questions. Just what exactly is the deal with Saya? We are clueless regarding her motivations, how she hooked up with the agency, why she can't kill humans...When she offs the last demon at the airfield, what was up with what she did afterwards? An old photograph near the end does flesh out her background some...And I don't really understand the relevance of the pre-Vietnam War backdrop (is it some kind of metaphor?). Not having all these questions answered doesn't bug me too much, but I can dig that it frustrates folks.There's a decent amount of gore and blood splatter here, a tiny lacing of profanity, and even a brief nude shot of a suicide victim in a bathtub. So, no, this isn't for the really young 'uns. Concerning special features, the 21-minute-long ""Making Of"" segment is pretty dry, because it's so technically driven, focusing as it does on the CG effects. But, hey, if you're a CG freak, this might be right up your alley. There's also the theatrical trailer and a photo gallery.Meeting Saya in BLOOD: THE LAST VAMPIRE is like briefly spending time with a stranger. You learn some stuff about the person, but not too much. You're made privy to the surface gloss, the public face, but that's all. For a span of forty-eight minutes, Saya lets us into her chaotic, violent life. But then she goes away, leaving us with the same impression we had when we first saw her - that of a sword-slinging enigma. In a weird way, that's kind of neat.",N/A

888087,"David Gordon Green, the writer and director of Undertow, has actually directed three films between Undertow and his exceptional debut film, George Washington. Nevertheless, Undertow marks his first highly praised film since that debut, and as I see it, reflects his true sophomore film in his precocious directorial career thus far.Sadly, Undertow borrows a bit too much from Terrence Malick. Gordon Green has admittingly stated that he is a Malick disciple (see the Charlie Rose interview for details), but he seems more set upon making a film from that realm of creativity than he actually does from his own. In Undertow, the Malickean borrowing process is at times incredibly annoying, and Gordon Green seems unable to give us a thorough plot with characters we actually give a flip about. I cared for those characters in George Washington, but the characters here in Undertow seem to be sidestepping any type of developmental elements whatsoever, and by the time the film is over, I was actually feeling sorrow for Gordon Green because I knew he was capable of doing much better.PLOT:Two boys living in Georgia with their impoverished father become intrigued by the sudden arrival of their uncle (Josh Lucas) who arrives without warning and with something maniacal brewing in his eyes. Soon, the boys are horrified to learn of what his true intentions are and the stage is set for a great hunt across the hot, summer landscapes of Georgia as they flee their uncle's malevolent pursuit. In the process, they come across a wide-range of tramps and do-gooders, some of whom will help them while others will seek to exploit them.3.5 out of 5",Undertow

1184017,"American cities of the northeast are plagued by an apparent terrorist attack in which people become confused then suicidal - leaping off skyscrapers, shooting themselves, impaling themselves with hairpins. As high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his unhappy wife and colleague flee to the country, it becomes evident the threat is more likely environmental. Nature is fighting back, with plants releasing some kind of toxin to defend themselves against the human industrial onslaught...M. Night Shyamalan executes on this charming premise with a deliberate eye to the sci-fi B-movie, both in style and theme, with lashings of gore, a cheesy score, and expository dialogue that at times sounds more like a textbook. Sadly, however, it doesn't entirely work. Shyamalan's no fool. He wouldn't make a B-movie without a specific intention. So what's going on here? Is the substance connected to the style? Does Shyamalan want us to go back to the 1950s? Is he trying to tell us that cities are bad? Is he echoing E. F. Schumacher's cry that ""small is beautiful""? Or is this a response to misplaced moral hysteria around 9/11? Falling bodies around 9.00am on a New York Tuesday certainly stir the echoes. Is he saying there are bigger threats to worry about than a few ideologues in planes; that 9/11, though a tragic event for those involved, is ultimately a miniscule blip compared to our disastrous global environmental trajectory? Or is it simply a musing on the fragility of humankind and the paucity of our knowledge? He'd be right on all counts, of course. But his intention is never clear.As an argument the film isn't very convincing, and as a piece of entertainment it's worse. Shyamalan's core skills as a writer-director seem to have deserted him - there is no suspense, no real drama, no trademark twist, not even any really nice shots (except the chilling iconic beauty of the falling workmen). It offers just a vague kind of discomfort that's regularly undermined by the near-comic suicide scenes. Shyamalan seems creatively paralysed himself. Still, the film's not entirely without merit. Its difference to standard summer fare makes it reasonably engaging for much of its short duration, and the wheels only really fall off when Moore and family let the power of love trump the power of self-preservation with a very convenient outcome.I think Shyamalan's also a victim of his own success - expectations are incredibly high for anything he does. From a young, first-time writer-director, this might be seen as competent Hollywood fare with an eye to tradition. From Shyamalan, it's well below par. Wahlberg is probably the strongest element here. He's regularly undermined by appalling dialogue, but his earnestness is endearing. Knowing where he's come from, as an actor and a person, to see him playing this kind of character in this kind of movie is nice.",N/A
1033137,"Guy Ritchie's previous British crime thrillers have their detractors, but they also have an amiable charm and cocky intelligence that are hard to resist.This new one, however, is not like the others.This is a movie that's so wound up, so pumped full of macho barium, that it eventually becomes an excruciating experience.Ritchie stretches out this time -- both in terms of plot and ambition -- and loads the movie with more style than all his previous movies combined. Wild sets and characters? Yes. Grandiosity that approaches Greenaway? Yes. Operatic in sound and scale and peppered with an occasionally cool shoot-out? Sure.But it's all shot through with a plot so intentionally convoluted, and Luc Besson production style so brassy and arranged, that watching ""Revolver"" quickly becomes like flipping through the ads in Vanity Fair with a 105-degree fever.  And not in a good way, either.In his commentary, Ritchie admits he's playing with the idea of ego and the notion that enemies and competition are all simply a product of the individual's interior desires.  That's a great concept on which to base a crime thriller but the movie is overloaded with too-obvious twists, faux-""Fight Club"" camera tricks and a ridiculously overblown sense of drama. Some scenes that inexplicably involve animation don't help either -- they don't make sense within the story and only serve to draw more comparisons to Tarantino, who did all this first and better within ""Kill Bill.""You know you're in trouble when you're watching a movie and you realize everybody in the film cares way, way more about the situations at hand than you do. In the case of ""Revolver,"" I'm pretty sure the main characters were 210% more concerned with the goings on of the story than I was.Meanwhile, a tangerine-tan Ray Liotta -- as, ostensibly, ""the bad guy"" -- spends most of the movie threatening his underlings and colorfully demanding they kill his enemies. Andre 3000 is joltingly self-conscious as a mysterious loan shark. And lead Jason Statham wanders through it all knowing his character is being played by some kind of scam, but submitting anyway. We know this because he spends the bulk of a seemingly endless voiceover reiterating what's already painfully obvious to the viewer.The most interesting part of the film is actually the end credits. That's when Ritchie rolls out interviews with experts and pundits talking about the concept of the ego. The fiction pushed me away, but the facts (or the search for facts) actually pulled me back.",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)

My stomach was so tight that I had lost any interest in eating after the film. Or maybe that was the extreme ""video-verite"" shaky camera handling.""Cloverfield"" follows a group of successful 20-something New Yorkers, whose celebration of the imminent departure of one of their number is interrupted by the arrival of a horrific, building-bashing monster. The conceit of the film is that is was recorded by a group of five people who split off from the party. Following some Gen-Y (""Y"" for YouTube) impulse to record everything, they drag their camera along through military counterattack, destroyed buildings and over-the-top mayhem. The medium gives the film a gritty man-in-the-street feel, and also gives the filmmakers a perfect rationale for not telling us where the monster comes from and what it wants -- we know only as much as the film's participants can see.But the film also has other strands and layers, which take it a notch above other monster films. The film is imagined in layers - we are movie viewers in a theater, watching a film located and studied by the military, which was shot by a group of New Yorkers, which itself was recorded over another (and important) piece of tape. The filmmakers carefully attended to the complicated layers of human relationships, which in a few visual strokes early on, built up a surprising amount of emotional complexity. Smart, serious, hunky Rob is crazy for gentle, gorgeous Beth, but is distraught that she attends the party with a new beau. Goofy, loyal Hud is nutty about snide/reclusive Marlene, who gives him as much attention as she would a 6-foot tall cockroach. Rob's bro Jason is madly in love with Lily. Each is played by a newcomer, so there's no star power to distract from the thesis that Bad Things Will Happen To Ordinary Well-off Young People. The whole going-away party episode may seem stuck on to some, but it is integral to the relationships that develop between the characters throughout the film.The film's effects were eye popping and very in-your-face: buildings collapse, bridges are wrecked and cars are stomped aplenty. The army has its hands full, and more. The monster, especially in the film's first half, is seen only in snippets. As with any monster movie, the less seen of the beast the better, and when we do get a fuller view, it's a bit of a letdown. But through all the carnage and devastation (Manhattan gets TRASHED!) the characters' initial (and realistic) shock and confusion gives way to a simple, logical yet foolhardy rescue attempt.Maybe because of their anonymity, the actors were able to meld into a realistic group, rather than fighting for star standing. And thanks to the excellent writing and directing, the characters were recognizable types. Though I hardly knew the characters, I nearly wept when one lost his life. And I laughed as Hud, Rob's boisterous and randy best friend, spent time running at the mouth or (between horrifying escapes from the monster) hitting on hard-to-get Marlene. These touches gave the viewer a delicious sense of the complexities brewing even in the most terrified of brains.The 9/11 links were understated, but omnipresent. So much so that some viewers might wonder if ""Cloverfield"" was a subtle allegory of that attack and the military response to it. Nevertheless, the parallels were sometimes unnerving -- an unexpected danger shocks an unprepared city; paper floats from damaged buildings; a skyscraper collapses and sends dust clouds into the street; evacuees clog bridges; the city canyon's walls echo the wailing sirens of emergency vehicles. If they meant nothing by the parallel, the filmmakers at least mined the store of commonly-held images of that day.""Cloverfield"" had a few plot holes and implausibilities--horrific injuries do little to slow down important characters?. But the film maintained its consistency throughout, and never found really stupid reasons to keep the camera rolling. For a great film about the way a group of unprepared, ordinary people react to a vicious and implacable threat, ""Cloverfield"" has few equals. A great time and a smartly-done film.",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
440580,"""Passenger 57"" has to be my very favorite Wesley Snipes movie and one of my very favorite action movies ever! I have been a huge fan of this movie ever since I first saw the trailer for it when I went to seeUnder Siege(another awesome movie.) At the height of this movie's popularity producers capitalized on Wesley's image as a strong leading man with the catchphrase: always bet on black. And that totally describes his role and this movie.Wesley plays John Cutter, a security expert who quit his job as a cop after his girlfriend was shot. And, Bruce Payne portrays Charles Rane the master-terrorist. Although, I thought Charles Rane was more funny than scary. Whose big idea was it to make the British dude with long blonde hair the villain  who tries to go up against Wesley Snipes?The film also includes some very impressive supporting roles. I especially enjoyed Alex Datcher (doesn't she look just like Halle Berry?) as Marti the tough-talking stewardess. And Elizabeth Hurley was in a somewhat smaller role as Sabrina Ritchie. I loved the part in the beginning when Sabrina says to Marti that she doesn't like her name because ""it makes me sound cold and heartless.""IMHO the early to mid-90's were the Golden Age of Suspense/Mystery-Action/Thrillers. There were so many great movies in this genre, during this time. Besides ""Passenger 57,"" I highly recommend these pictures:Single White Female,The Good Son,The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,Unlawful Entry,The Crush,The Client,Under Siege,Poison IvyandThe Fugitive.""Passenger 57"" is just the perfect showcase for Wesley Snipes because he does it all. He does a little fighting, he jumps off a plane, he does a little shooting and the man's even mistaken for Arsenio!!",N/A
266300,"This is 3rd and finale in the series with Michael J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd in the old west - the year 1885. So, this time its an action adventure in the old west with trains,horses,romance and that Western atmosphere. Fox as Marty McFly has to save Blacksmith Brown from being killed by Beauford Tanner (Thomas J. Wilson). Dr. Brown(Lloyd) falls in love this time with Mary Steenburgen which is something Marty McFly brought to the West with him - Dr Browns future and demise. Because Dr. Brown is in love it affects the return to his time since he doesnt want to leave her behind. A tough choice for him. There were some great high points in this,just like the others. It has the same formula/chemistry as the first 2. I loved the ending where the train has to push the Time Machine car to 88mph to go back from 1885 to 1985. I think it has the charm,fun and energy of the first 2. Some say it was flatter,while others love it. I thoroughly enjoyed the series, the chemistry of the acting with Lloyd & Fox is there,despite a slightly weaker story compared to the first 2. How often are sequels better than the first films ? Not too often but some are just as good, and the whole Back to the Future Trilogy is just fantastic fun and entertaining. Part 3 is a satisfying conclusion to the series.",Back to the Future Part III VHS
954132,"I have been a big fan of Leonard Nimoy for many years, and this wonderful DVD of his one-man play VINCENT has led me to admire him even more. Nimoy gives a very sincere and dramatic performance, and the story is true since it's all based on letters between Vincent Van Gogh and his brother Theo. The day after I watched the play, I ran it again but this time listening to the commentary track, and was again enthralled as Nimoy told fascinating background stories that showed his dedication to this project. For instance, he noted that many of Van Gogh's paintings have often been reproduced poorly in books, so Nimoy personally re-photographed many of them and offered his photos to museums and book publishers. This example illustrates Nimoy's passion about the art and life of Vincent Van Gogh that shines through in the play. Another bonus on the disc is an enjoyable slide show of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings. As you might guess, I highly recommend this DVD!!",N/A
269704,"Fox continues to release the Temple films without any real extras; this one appears to be no exception. Since it was also part of a John Ford boxed set, it underwent an extensive overhaul (about 77 hours according to the background information on the DVD). Original elements at Fox were unusable for ""Winkie,"" but the final result is very good. There is NO colorized version to choose from here, but rather a sepia-tone version, just as the film was originally released. For film buffs, this is a plus!""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) VERY loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's popular story. Taken by her mother (June Lang) to live in India, a young girl (Temple) gradually wins the heart of her feisty grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith), a colonel at a British army outpost. Before long, she captures the hearts of his entire regiment as well as his chief enemy (Cesar Romero), using her charms to prevent a full-scale war. Directed by John Ford; definitely one of Temple's best films, thanks to the chemistry between Temple & Romero, and Temple & Victor McLaglen (get the hankies out for one of their scenes). Presented as a flipper disc featuring a tinted version of the film (in a very pleasing sepia tone) that was based on original notes and research to make the film look as it was first released as well as the black and white original, both in their original full-screen theatrical aspect ratio. With English Stereo plus English and Spanish Mono, the feature also includes English, French and Spanish subtitles. 100 minutes. Bonus feature: Restoration Comparison which describes in detail what was done.This film is also available as part of the John Ford collection AND as part of Volume 6 in Fox's Shirley Temple Collection.",Shirley Temple: Wee Willie Winkie VHS

1129111,"Directed by the great Sidney Lumet (Serpico,Dog Day Afternoon,12 Angry Men), this is a dark heist drama about terribly corrupt people.  Fairly ordinary in its theme these days but Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is remarkably deep in engaging and underrated performances.  The cast includes Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, Brian O'Byrne, Amy Ryan, and of course the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman in a role worthy of incredibly high praise, especially considering how unique the role is for Hoffman, who normally plays characters with a small fraction of the presence and confidence he has here.  He is actually intimidating in some scenes which is a far cry from his equally engaging performances inCapoteorLove Liza.Hoffman is Andy Hanson, an executive of seemingly solid repute, who has embezzled from his employer and is about to be audited.  He needs money to make up for the losses due to his theft.  Either that or he needs money to run far away from the law.  He convinces his brother Hank (Hawke), who is also in need of money for his own reasons, to plan an armed robbery on a jewelry store.  The moral dilemma here is that the jewelry store belongs to and is run by their parents.  The plan fails in ways I won't reveal and eventually leads to various forms of further descent for the two characters.  Albert Finney plays the father of Andy and Hank.Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is shot on high definition video and it is one of the first times I've seen the format used this effectively for a fairly low-budget feature length film.  I guess even at 83 years old, Lumet is still evolving as a filmmaker, albeit the subject matter is still pretty consistent.  He understands the technical end and he has always known how to tell a good story on film.  The quick release on Blu-Ray was also welcome and of course consistent with the move to film on high definition.The story is told in various segments that bounce back and forth in time surrounding and during the events mentioned in the brief summary above.  This was probably done to show the various character's perspectives on the events and was pretty effective for that.  The movie was made on Lumet's own terms and that is something I can respect, but what made it surprising to me was the power of the characters and the performances of the actors in their roles.  It really is a highlight on the resumes of all the actors involved and that is saying something for the likes of Finney, Hawke, and Hoffman. It is dark and has its own pace but I definitely recommend seeing Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.",N/A
139823,"Leaving Las Vegas is an Oscar winning movie that takes what should be repulsive material and spins it into gold. The story is about an alcoholic who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death, and while there he forges a strong relationship with a prostitute. Nicolas Cage won the Oscar for this role, and he really deserved it. Sometimes he makes you laugh with his drunken antics, but often times you absolutely cringe. His drunken attempts at picking up women in bars are really pathetic. The woman reel away from the stench of his breath, and you can almost smell it yourself.Ben Sanderson: I don't know if my wife left me because of my drinking or I started drinking 'cause my wife left me.Elisabeth Shue also turns in the role of a lifetime. She has her own esteem issues, to be sure. At one point, she admits that she is only using him. Ben and Sera have an intense relationship where the only rules are, no matter what, Sera can't ask Ben to stop drinking. She knows he is trying to kill himself, but she has to accept that. She buys him clothes and lets him move in with her. She tries to feed him plain rice, but throughout the film, he never eats anything. Apparently a symptom of acute alcoholism, in the advance stages they can't keep any food down. When she prepares him plain rice, a bland dish that she hopes he can handle, he only eats an ice cube with his chopsticks.Sera: Don't you like me, Ben?Ben Sanderson: Sera... what you don't understand is - no, see, no. You can never, never ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?Sera: I do. I really do.Cage doesn't hold back one bit, and takes his character over the edge of the abyss. At one point he watches a stripper and chugs a pint of liquor. The raunchy jazz on the soundtrack seems to imply that he is playing a strange reverse solo on his bottle. The shock of so much alcohol to his system makes the sound drop away. He is in his own world, like a near death experience where he is crawling towards the light...Sera: How do you feel?Ben Sanderson: Like the kling klang king of the rim ram room.Shue for some reason really impressed me the most when she was embarrassed and shamed by Ben's drunken antics. In one mishap he falls smack down on a glass table while lounging by a pool in a desert motel.Ben Sanderson: Look at me... I'm a prickly pear.When the innkeeper lady comes out to sweep up the glass she thinks she can charm her way out of it, but is told to go to her room, and in the morning, to check out and never return. Not quite as drunk as Ben, she is still capable of shame. She can also be hurt by him, as when she goes out working, and Ben gambles and takes a hooker back to her room. The look on her face when she returns is so poignant.Sera: What's up?Ben Sanderson: I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you've a boyfriend, or a girlfriend, but I thought maybe we could get some dinner.You have two extremely powerful performances here, Cage and Shue, or rather Ben and Sera, are two messed up people, but this is also a tender love story. There is a lot of great jazz on the soundtrack, like for instance Sting does the ballads Angel Eyes and My One and Only Love. The former was a favorite of Ella Fitzgerald, while the latter was featured on the Coltrane and Johnny Hartman collaboration. The music is at times cheesy, but intentionally so. Perfect for the Las Vegas casino vibe. Other times sophisticated, funky, or even almost angelic in some of the later scenes of transcendence. Director Mike Figgis is a musician, and he also composed the score, as well as playing keyboards and trumpet on it. Not only that, he pulls a Hitchcock with a cameo, playing a mobster who passes Ben in the hallway, perhaps on his way to execute Sera's pimp. He is really a renaissance man, that Mike Figgis. In at least two scenes taxis are shown with an advertisement on the roof hoarding depicting a brand called ""Red Mullet"" - the name of director Mike Figgis's production company and it's his face in the ad.Sera: Is drinking a way of killing yourself?Ben Sanderson: Or, is killing myself a way of drinking?John O'Brien, the writer, perhaps didn't actually do all the things that Ben, the character in his book did, but he did commit suicide about two weeks after the film began production. Director Mike Figgis contemplated abandoning the project, but decided the film would make a good memorial for O'Brien. Did he drink himself to death? Perhaps it is just morbid curiosity on my part, but apart from how much of John O'Brien may or may not be in his character Ben, it is a very compelling narrative. O'Brien's prose has been compared to Charles Bukowski or Larry Brown.Sera: That's nice talk, Ben - keep drinking. Between the 101-proof breath and the occasional bits of drool, some interesting words come out.I haven't read the book, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the book was much better than the film. However, the film was good enough to win several Oscars and nominations, in spite of the ugly subject matter. It told the story very well in cinematic terms. There are lots of beautiful shots; the neon lights of Vegas never looked prettier. There is a shot filmed underwater where Ben drinks from a bottle of beer even though he is submerged. The best shower scenes since Psycho, where Ben and Sera both are trying to cleanse themselves from some gut wrenching scene of defilement. Ben even showers with not one but two bottles of liquor.Sera: So why are you a drunk?Ben Sanderson: Why am I a drunk? Is that really what you wanna ask me?Sera: Yes.Ben Sanderson: Well, then, this is our first date, or our last. Until now I wasn't sure it was either.Does it glorify alcoholism? I don't really think it does that at all. It is really horrendous and the downward spiral a pathetic tragedy. If anything is glorified, it is the spirit and love of the two main characters in spite of some serious character flaws.Ben Sanderson: I came here to drink myself to death.Sera: How long will it take you?Ben Sanderson: I'd say about three to four weeks.SELECTED FILMS AND ROLES OF NICOLAS CAGEGhost Rider (Widescreen Edition)(2007) ....

903856,"At the outset I want to say that prior to getting this dvd collection, I was not a fan of the show.  Due in large part to the media, I did not think this was going to be good.  Quite simply, I thought that the show simply took easy shots at the party in power.  But as the 2008 Presidential campaigning started and I saw this set at a reasonable price on Amazon (I bought it used), I, a fan of comedy, decided to give this a shot.  And I must say that I have rarely been this pleasantly surprised.  Sure, I think that if you look at the show as a whole, they probably do take more shots at the Republicans, but it is nowhere near as skewered as some would have you believe.  And particularly this set of dvds, which pokes even fun at both sides for the 2004 Presidential election.I hope that the powers that be at Comedy Central give us ""Indecision 2008"" on dvd at the end of this year (we all know they have plenty of material already, and we all know this Presidential election is going to give us a lot more comedy between now and November 2008).Sincerely,A Former Non-FanPS - THIS is what the Colbert Report dvd SHOULD have been like!",The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - Indecision 2004

The movie is about a group of campers who go to Ireland to do ""shrooms"" or ""magic mushrooms""(what they were called in my day)in the woods. Having dabbled in many things in my youth, I know this is a bad, BAD idea! The films starts off like so many other horror movies going to unfamiliar surroundings to party and have sex, then tell a scary story to freak everyone out before going to bed. Lots of clich&eacute;'s fill this watch-able but, ultimately forgettable horror film. I did like the ending a little, as it seemed to make this all seem possible.

1129870,"Few films released last year have the quiet sensitivity in writing (Allan Loeb), direction (Susanne Bier), cinematography (Tom Stern), and acting (Berry, Del Toro, Duchovny) as this gem of a movie.  Taking on a subject of grief after a sudden traumatic death and the way it affects family and friends would seem like a tedious subject for a two hour film, but THINGS WE LOST IN THE FIRE proves again that care and devotion in telling a difficult story with restraint and tenderness is far more compelling that many of the 'big' movies that fill the theaters with more superficial topics.Brian Burke (David Duchovny) is a generously warm man to his beautiful wife Audrey (Halle Berry), their son Dory (Micah Berry), and daughterHarper (Alexis Llewellyn) as well as to his longtime, childhood friend Jerry Sunborne (Benecio Del Toro) who is constantly struggling with an addiction to heroin. Brian is suddenly dead as the film opens and the friends are gathered at the Burke home for the funeral.  Audrey is devastated by the abrupt loss and quietly bears her shock in order to be present for her children.  During the reception Audrey suddenly remembers she has not informed Brian's best friend Jerry of his death and sends her brother to fetch him for the services.  We meet the wasted Jerry, the shambles of his heroin-addicted life obvious in his tiny apartment, and yet when Jerry hears the news of Brian's death, he is profoundly shocked: Brian is the only friend he has.  Jerry makes himself presentable and attends the funeral and despite the fact that Audrey had always considered Jerry  a 'weight' on Brian, the two offer each other a zone of connection that cannot be filled by any other.  Slowly Jerry becomes part of the Burke household and his role in offering love to the children and solace and protection to Audry results in changes in Jerry's life that provides one bit of evidence of the redemption that can occur from shared grieving. 'Things', such as those items lost in a fire at the Burke's in the past, are simply 'things': interpersonal connection, hope, and the 'light from within' are what truly matter.Berry and Del Toro give finely nuanced performances in these difficult roles, further establishing their credentials as being two of our finest actors in film.  But the entire cast of this film is pitch-perfect and under the direction of Bier communicates powerfully with the viewer.  The extraordinary camera work concentrates on extreme closeup views of eyes, hands, lips and tears and allows the viewer an intimate relationship with these characters.  Johan S&ouml;derqvist provides a subtle musical score that underlines the story without calling attention to itself.  For this viewer this is hands down one of the finest films of 2007.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, March 08",N/A

1125310,"""As he stood there, unarmed, with his back to me, it came to me suddenly, 'Now or never is your chance. If you don't get him now he'll get you tonight.' Without further thought or a moment's delay I pulled my revolver and leveled it as I sat. He heard the hammer click as I cocked it with my thumb and started to turn as I pulled the trigger. The ball struck him just behind the ear and he fell like a log, dead.""In a letter to Missouri Governor Thomas Crittenden, Robert Ford uses the above excerpt to describe the fashion in which he murdered the infamous Jesse James, an act which is laboriously but nevertheless fantastically depicted in fledgling writer-director Andrew Dominik's ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"".""Assassination..."" is a slow draw, literally and figuratively.  The movie illustrates Robert Ford's childish admiration of the outlaw Jesse James and his desire to become a part of his now disintegrating gang, James looking to retire from a life of crime in the interest of raising his children with an honest living.  Worming his way into their last big heist, Robert (Affleck) and his brother Charley (Rockwell) become enticed by a $10,000 bounty placed on James's head and decide to cash in.  What they don't count on is mutiny on the bound in the form of Wood Hite, James's cousin and a cocky gunslinger whom is wary of Robert from the moment he appears.  Robert is viewed as a stain on the small band and when he and Wood begin to butt heads, a shoot out ensues, leaving Wood in need of a coffin.  Now out on the lam for a murder, Robert makes a deal with Missouri Governor Thomas T. Crittenden to be pardoned in exchange for the death of Jesse James.  Robert is only happy to do so, his reward not only monetary but his role as executioner of a well-known criminal paving the way for self-generated celebrity.  Oddly enough, once the deed is done, a reversal of roles takes place and Jesse, despite his nefarious reputation, is revered while Robert is scorned for his ultimate betrayal of a legendary figure.The film's lengthy title appropriately serves to represent its extensive duration.  At 2 hours and 40 minutes (the original cut was almost four hours - YIKES), half of who sit down to view it will be squirming in their seats and repeatedly checking their watches (or the counter on their DVD player).  Things do not happen quickly in this film and if it weren't for the performances from Affleck, Pitt and Rockwell and an excellent screenplay from director Andrew Dominik, it would be lost on most people (not to mention the inevitable incomplete viewings because someone fell asleep or just flat out turned it off because they became wearied by it all).  I am of the opinion that it could've used some serious offerings for the cutting room floor; as it is, some scenes are inexplicably long and there are so many pregnant pauses between bits of dialogue that you wish the producer(s) and/or editor(s) would've just cut to the chase instead of letting their actors linger, staring off into space as if they needed a cue.  This is by far the most bothersome feature when one views ""Assassination..."" and should be considered a warning to anyone who prefers movies that roll along at a productive pace.Other than the above complaints, there is a lot to be enjoyed and appreciated about ""Assassination..."", starting with Casey Affleck.  Affleck has found another interesting role this year, the first of which was a commendable performance in ""Gone Baby Gone"".  His portrayal of Robert's fear as well as inferiority to those around him are palpable; when confronted with the moment his ruse has been exposed to Jesse, his body literally sinks into a chair, face glistening from sweat and fighting off tears as he waits with a blanched face and his heart in his throat for his imminent execution.  It's that palpability that had him nearly winning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this year (he lost to Javier Bardem for ""No Country For Old Men"", indisputably deserved).  If he keeps playing his cards right, he'll become a better actor than his brother Ben will ever be (personally, I think he has already surpassed Ben in that department).  Perhaps it was meant to be that the elder of the Afflecks made the transition to the director's chair whilst Casey remains burned in the effigy of film, ergo the minds of audiences nationwide.Pitt has always been an iffy actor but the role of Jesse James seems to suit him and he plays the part well of a man torn by his conviction to protect his own best interests and a man whom is trying to make amends with the past.  There is also the implication that James is mentally disquieted, the victim of what could appear to some people to be frightening episodes of bipolar disorder.  James even so much as admits this to himself when he says, ""I haven't been acting correctly. I can't hardly recognize myself sometimes when I'm greased. I go on journeys out of my body and look at my red hands and my mean face and I wonder about that man who's gone so wrong. I've been becoming a problem to myself."" One minute he is maniacally laughing, the next he is staring off into the distance with glazed and melancholy eyes.  Pitt is spell-binding in a scene where James goes off the deep end, cackling wildly whilst quietly ruminating his inability to trust Ford - when he suddenly whips out a blade in a blind rage ready to slit Ford's throat, we see just how unpredictable and unstable James has become.  This scene only serves to validate his gang's growing fear and/or uncertainty of him and sheds light on the reason why his brother Frank (Shepard) parted ways with him.  In a time when mental disorders were little understood, this only serves to explain why James may have been the way he was and why he had become so dangerous to those who knew him.Sam Rockwell is a memorable supporting role as Charley Ford and despite his happy-go-lucky demeanor he is well aware of Jesse's savage temperament.  In the end, out of guilt and self-loathing, he spares himself of the disdain to which his brother Robert is subjected in the only manner he thinks is dignified and just.Shot largely in different parts of Canada, ""Assassination..."" was also well deserved of its Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography (cinematographer Robert Elswit won this for ""There Will Be Blood""), Roger Deakins capturing the simplistic beauty of Alberta's sprawling hills, fields and forests as well as its brutal but spellbinding winters.Bottom line: ""Assassination..."" really requires some patience on a viewer's part.  This virtue of virtues will be well rewarded by rich, complex performances by the film's leads and the whole of its supporting cast.",N/A

820146,"The 1950s were the Golden Age of schlock sci fi films- ranging from films so bad they've become classics- Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Robot Monster, to some better than expected films like The Brain From Planet Arous, and Them. It's the first set of films that is taken aim at by the film The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra- replete with actors playing bad actors, who recite intentionally bad dialogue, that's repeated ad nauseam, as well as bad special effects and a determined `humanitarian message'. This spoof of such films was written, directed, and starred in by Larry Blamire.The best part of this film is that, to enjoy it, one need not be drenched in the films it spoofs- it plays as both a `straight' schlock film, and a satire. Blamire plays Dr. Paul Armstrong, a heroic scientist, in love with science, even as he notes scientists believe in nothing, out to retrieve a meteorite containing `atmosphereum'. Fay Masterson is devoted wife, Betty. Susan McConnell and Andrew Parks are aliens named Lattis and Kro-Bar- descendants not only of nineteen-fifties alien stolidity, but the old Saturday Night Live Coneheads couple, in their forced imitations of human customs. Brian Howe and Jennifer Blaire (Blamire's real life wife) are mad scientist Dr. Roger Fleming and his woman-beast Animala- created using the alien's ray gun- a direct knock off of Plan 9's Vampira....  The schmaltziness, choppy editing, black and white, stock 1950s sci fi score, stock nature film footage of the animals Animala's created from, bad special effects- a miniature rocket ship, bad Geiger counter-like devices, and a cheesy inside to the aliens' rocketship, plus typically inappropriate Cold War-era morality playing, make the film an unexpected delight. Some critics think that camp can only occur unwittingly- such as in the cases of Ed Wood, or the worst of the Roger Corman films- and they may be right. But, The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra isn't camp- it's satire, and there's a difference- self-awareness. Viewed seriously Plan 9 From Out Of Space may well be `the worst movie ever made'- with classic lines as `You humans are stupid, stupid, stupid!' meant to be social commentary. Fortunately, its unintended camp quotient, and myriad laughs, make it far more enjoyable than many sober, and somber films that reek. The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra does not have that problem, for it's knowingly being bad. While you may not think a scene or line funny, there's an `insider'-type meta-quality to the film that practically insulates it from any criticism. If you loathe `good' bad films along with `bad' bad films you'll never get this film on any level. If you can discern the difference you cannot help but, at least, love- if not revel in the film. It was even shot in Bronson Canyon, outside Los Angeles, where films like Robot Monster, and many others, were shot.",The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra
1091725,"I've always adored Earl Wild. After going through this extraordinary compendium of sight and sound, I love him a hundred times more. Yes, he deserved a far better piano for the historic 1986 recitals at England's Wynyard Park. The DVD booklet warns that the piano, shipped in from London, was not ideally adjusted. The documentary proves that the piano was at least tuned, although it didn't seem to hold the tuning very well in the late-July heat. I get the sense that Wild often had to fight the instrument to get something half decent out of it (what a shame that he could not have picked out an instrument in London before it arrived up north). As a result, Wild's playing sometimes goes uncharacteristically choppy. I'm sure that quite a few of the wrong notes can be blamed on the recalcitrant keyboard (like all great musicians, Wild plays his wrong notes the right way, without the slightest perturbation). As the recitals proceed, Wild progressively tames the beast a bit, I think.Be all that as it may, we are surely much the richer because Tony Gaw (a friend of Lord Londonderry, owner of Wynyard) thoughtfully preserved this great occasion for us (the final July 30 recital began on the evening before the centennial of Liszt's passing; indeed, in the accompanying documentary Londonderry muses that the recital might even end close to the time of Liszt's death, which therefore must have come not long after midnight on July 31, 1886). I was fortunate to hear this same three-recital sequence (with the addition of the third *Liebestraum* as the opening of ""Liszt the Poet"") when Wild presented it in Cambridge,  Mass., in April and May 1986, so I am thrilled to see that nearly all of it has been preserved.Many thanks to ""South Carolina"" for the program details (why did Ivory fail to supply them in the booklet? By the way, the first two recitals, on DVD 1, are properly broken down into individual chapters. The final recital, on DVD 2, is one annoyingly continuous chapter). South Carolina's program for the third recital is incomplete, however. After *Gnomenreigen*, we hear:- Four of the *Douze &eacute;tudes d'ex&eacute;cution transcendante* (12 Transcendental Etudes): 3, 2, 9 & 10- Three Hungarian Rhapsodies: 12, 4 & 2- Eug&egrave;ne d'Albert's Scherzo in F#, Op. 16/2 (encore)Also worth noting: the 1974 BBC interview with Robin Ray contains five complete live performances in studio (on a vastly more responsive and better-recorded B&ouml;sendorfer, thank goodness):- Liszt's *Gnomenreigen*, Sonetto del Petrarca 104, and  *La campanella*- d'Albert's Scherzo in F#- Chopin's *Grande polonaise* in E-flat, Op. 22Here and elsewhere, Wild makes a persuasive case for transposing many 19th-century works down by up to a third (in Beethoven's case; more often, by a whole tone) to correct for the relentless rise in concert pitch. He demonstrates his point with Chopin's Op. 25/1 (the ""Aeolian Harp"" &eacute;tude) and Op. 25/12 (the ""Ocean"" &eacute;tude), playing the opening passages in their ""correct"" keys before transposing them down a full tone.Perhaps the set's biggest ""Easter egg"" pops up in the middle of Wild's 1982 Philadelphia radio interview: a performance of Copland's Piano Concerto, with Copland leading The Symphony of the Air (whose presence necessarily dates the recording to somewhere between 1954 and 1963).The other video extras feature Wild at the keyboard, but only in snippets. The audio interviews are just as delightful as their video counterparts. Among the many revelations from these extras: Wild began playing Scharwenka's First Piano Concerto when he was 14, so he was more than ready when Erich Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony needed a soloist for their classic 1969 recording. Throughout, Wild is unpretentiously charming and often howlingly funny as he reflects on his extraordinary life (Wild tells several illuminating Toscanini anecdotes and provides direct evidence about Debussy's youthful visit to Spain from Debussy's traveling companion Henry Hornbostel, the principal architect for Carnegie Mellon University, whom Wild met as a 19-year-old student). Lastly, there is a voluminous photo gallery filled with historic and contemporary images about Wynyard Park (you'll need to hit the pause button to take in big texts like those from old newspaper articles).All in all, this set exploits just about everything a DVD can do with image and sound. It's a fabulous romp and a reference for the ages. I pray that Wild makes it to 100 and beyond with all his wits. What a sorry world we will have when his exuberant spirit takes flight.",N/A
130311,"1999's ""The General's Daughter"" takes place at and around a coastal Georgia military base. John Travolta plays an Army investigator who teams up with Madeleine Stowe, a woman he once had an affair with (yeah right), to solve the ugly murder of the daughter of the commanding officer, herself a captain.Whether you like Travolta or not, there's no denying his star power. He easily carries this film as the protagonist from beginning to end. The real cast highlight for me, however, is the stunning Madeleine Stowe (remember her from 1992's excellent ""Last of the Mohicans""?). Throughout most of the film Madeleine wears a white sleeveless shirt and form-fitting tan-ish slacks; she's just spellbinding.The film is rated R and for good reason. There are numerous scenes of a naked woman staked out spread-eagled, both alive and dead. Besides murder, the picture features overt elements of S & M and gang rape. This may turn some potential viewers away, but the film is worth sticking with if you can brace yourself for the sordid aspects. How so? Because ""The General's Daughter"" powerfully shows that sexual abuse must be addressed and not shoved under the rug. Inner wounds must be properly bound and healed, not dismissed with a casual shrug.My wife and I recently saw a fascinating documentary on prostitutes. I never could understand how a woman could have sexual relations (especially oral sex) with some dirty, smelly sleazebag for money. It's gag-inducing to me. With one exception every prostitute interviewed confessed to being sexually abused while growing up. The abuse was never properly addressed and, consequently, no real inner-healing could take place. The abuse literally damned the women to a sordid life of self-loathing and self-destruction. My heart goes out to them!The sleazy sexual elements are so in-your-face in ""The General's Daughter"" that it's hard to look past it to the meat of the story. The unaddressed sexual abuse of the General's daughter leads to an ultra-promiscuous and deviant lifestyle, resulting -- of course -- in misery and (ultimately) destruction.Travolta's character briefly knew the general's daughter before her murder. What compels him to solve the murder and enact justice & vengeance on the direct and indirect perpetrators (aside from the fact that it's his job) is that he clearly saw a genuine gleam of beauty and life in her. Amazon reviewer Steven Quan understandably objects that, if she was as horribly abused as depicted in the story, she wouldn't be so vibrant and perky. But, nevertheless, this vibrancy and inner beauty is authentic. Travolta knows it because he experienced it. It's a glimpse of who she really was or could be, a glimmer of her potential as a woman and a human being. True, most of it may merely be a public veneer, an act she hides behind, but the flimsy root is REAL. Unfortunately it's overshadowed by her raw torment within, inner pain so great that it compels her to ridiculously radical actions.When Travolta finally figures out what and who destroyed the inner beauty and potential of this young woman his righteous anger is potent and palpable.I heard the story was loosely based on real-life events, but can't verify it.The picture was filmed on location in coastal Georgia, around Savannah. There's also a breathtaking shot of West Point, NY, where a small portion of the story takes place.CONCLUSION: ""The General's Daughter"" is more than just a meaningless detective mystery/thriller. It's thought-provoking and delivers a powerful message. Some won't get it. Some are unable to get it. Others can't get past the sleazy elements. For the rest of us it's a worthwhile, heavy and potent piece of filmmaking. Travolta is at his charismatic best and Madeleine Stowe is spellbinding. I'd give it a higher rating, but the implausible Hollywoodisms stack-up toward the end and the revelation of the murderer and aftermath is weak.GRADE: B+",N/A

177619,"Who Killed the Electric Car? (Chris Paine, 2006)I should start this review off by saying that I'm probably the least environmentally-conscious person you'd ever want to meet; if no one had already started the Pave the Earth society, I'd have to. In other words, I am not the person Chris Paine had in mind when he set out to make this movie.All that said, I've always been fascinated by the idea of the electric car. Not just for the coolness factor (and the coolness factor is undeniable), but for simple pragmatic reasons-- why spend three bucks a gallon on gas if you can spend sixty cents a ""gallon"" on electricity? (That number is actually quoted in the film, by the by.) The environmental factor doesn't get me, but you appeal to my wallet and I'm all ears.Those of us outside California have never heard the whole story. California was the first state to adopt electric cars on a macro level (and at this writing, they are still the only state to have done so). How many of them were there out there? I don't know the exact number-- Paine and his interviewees never mention it-- but it was a lot more than I thought. I always thought the electric car was something that hobbyists built from kits. That major car companies had produced purely electric vehicles? Nope. No idea. And people were driving them. And liking them. (I take all the protest stuff with a grain of salt. People will protest anything. But the liking them, that means something.) And then, suddenly, they were all recalled. The bulk of the movie is Paine looking at various aspects of where the blame might be placeable. It should be no surprise that most of them deserve it.The question you have to ask yourself is how much of it is straight reporting and how much is conspiracy theory. A lot of it does come off as straight out of the tin hat society, but what separates it from the usual conspiracy babble is that Paine, at least, trusts the viewers to draw their own conclusions. A real wacko won't do that-- they have to spell everything out. Paine just lays it all out and effectively says ""you decide."" Big mark in his favor. Granted, a lot of what he lays out is there for emotional button-pushing, but haven't we all seen enough Hollywood weepies to separate the scenes of people crying at the Electric Car Funeral from the numbers? There's something very disturbing going on here, no matter how slanted the picture that presents it, and it deserves a great deal more research and exposure. Paine has done a very important thing, I think, in bringing this story to a much wider audience than it has previously seen, and I hope it gets some sort of ball rolling. *** ",N/A
1022875,"We all know the boss.  The man/woman who knows it all and tramples on everyone.  I've worked for her; you probably have too.""The Devil Wears Prada"" is the ""simple"" story of a young college graduate, Andy (Anne Hathaway), trying to find a job.  She looks at a fashion magazine, Runway, whose editor-in-chief, Miranda (Meryl Streep), is so harsh that girls who last one year as her assistant are granted ""any job they set their heart on"".  The problem?  Andy is so not into fashion, it's not funny.  And Miranda is, well...""difficult"".I was unsure if I would actually enjoy the film.  I had heard mixed reviews.  But after finally seeing it for myself, I realized that on the whole, I enjoyed it.  Anne Hathaway has the ""My Fair Lady"" role down-pat.  Emily Blunt is very appealing as Emily, the desperate assistant.  Even the actor who plays Nigel is charming.  But Meryl Streep as Miranda is the star of the show.  She steals the screen every time she appears, with enormous presence, a cool gaze, and her quiet, demanding voice.The other characters are weak.  We as the audience are supposed to be rooting for Andy to spend more time with her friends, but when her boyfriend, Nate, acts like a baby when she has to work on his birthday, you can't help but dislike them (I mean, come on, how many adults REALLY celebrate their birthday on their actual birth date?).  When Nate says it would be better for her to be a pole stripper with integrity (what the...?!) than what she is, you want to kick him where the sun don't shine.The plot is not complicated, well done, but the big ""turning points"" can be seen a mile away (such as Andy's conversion to fashion, her being chosen to go to Paris, and her eventual quitting).  The clothes are beautiful (well, some of them are odd, but that's coming from a Wal-Mart girl :) ), the pacing perfect, and the scenery (particularly Paris) beautiful.  There is some foul language, a scene where a woman gets hit by a car, some allusions to eating disorders, the overall impression that clothes size does matter (Andy ends the film as a ""satisfied"" size 4 after being a ""fat"" size 6) and some sexual situations, but nothing particularly glaring.Overall, I liked the film.  It is a great story of a young woman trying to justify her job with her morals.  While I did not like how her friends (particularly her boyfriend) did not understand that sometimes you have to do things you don't like (aka your job) to pay the rent (and get the expensive purses that your friend rather enjoys) and that fun things will have to come later, it is a really good movie that showcases Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway's talents.NOTE (Sep. 10, 2009): Another irk I had with the movie was the terrible job interviews.  No one with half a brain will go into a job interview and admit that the only reason they are there is because it was their last resort.  I can pretty much tell you they will be leaving unemployed.  Secondly, people who are interviewing for jobs ought to check out the place they are interviewing.  That is just basic interviewing common sense.  Lastly, using slang like ""screwing up"" and admitting you made mistakes is, contrary to what the film shows, not going to endear you to your future employer.  Always use proper formal language and never try to sell yourself short.  You admit failures; you are basically saying that you aren't worth hiring.Brought to you by*C.S. Light*",N/A

846752,"I bought this on video from the pound shop, I wasn't expecting much but last night I watched it and I was blow away, what a brilliant film, even better than Pitch Black which frightened the life out of me.Vin Diesel is brilliant as the brutal yet tender convict Riddick who finds himself once more on the run across the Galaxy, this time with a bigger price on his head than before.Enter an old friend from Pitch Black who has settled down with his young family, a planet about to be subjugated by the brutal Necromancers, an elemental race who predict probabilities based on cause an effect, Judi Dench is wonderful in this cameo role, elegant, stylish and full of secrets, she alone knows WHAT Riddick is and why the Lord Marshal fears him so much.Karl Urban as the fanatical Lord Vakko of the Necromancers pushes all the right buttons to enrage Riddick and Thandie Newton as his scheming ambitious wife is a delight to behold along with a troubled Necromancer Commander, Linus Roache, an understated actor by the way, with secrets of his own along with an agenda that could the herald the end of the reign of the Lord Marshal. And then there is Kyra, the girl that Riddick loves but will never admit to loving, a girl he will go half way across the galaxy to find and save even if it means his own demise.This is an action packed movie from beginning to end, with state of the art special effects, some fantastic fight sequences, some hilarious moments that make you laugh out loud, some briefly gross out moments and some eye popping stunts that have you on the edge of your seat, oh and the monster dogs on the prison planet are fantastic!This is a great movie, get the Director's cut though, it rocks!",N/A

They rob banks during the depression, and they're joined by Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman), Buck's wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and a young gas station attendant (Michael J.

Clyde in particular is almost innocently childlike in his self-centeredness and lack of consideration of the consequences of his actions, not to mention his ambiguous sexuality. I'm not that well-versed in evaluating acting performances, but I believed all these characters.Which is not to say that I believe Beatty and Dunaway were just like the actual Barrow and Parker.

958419,"""Bleak House"" is my favorite Dickens novel.  I've read it 3 or 4 times.(This is saying a lot.  It's tremendously long and complex.)So I looked forward to seeing a good video adaptation.The 1991 Diana Rigg version was a disappointment.  Far too dark.  Far too muddled in handling the many interweaving plots.But this ""Bleak House""--the Gillian Anderson version--is superb.First, it doesn't simplify.  It retains almost all the many, many characters, even though some period satire is lost.  (Mr. Chadband, for example.)  This conveys the huge sprawling complexity of Dickens's world.Second, it is both bright and dark visually--moving from glorious pastoral and rustic scenery to the dark typhoid misery and mud of Tom All Alone's.  This is thematically important, because the book is both very optimistic and darkly hopeless.Third, it knows which characters are key.  This version makes much of Mr. Tulkinghorn.  He becomes the evil lynchpin of all the many plots.  He is played wonderfully well by Charles Dance.It also does an excellent job with Esther Summerson--a hard character to make real, but absolutely pivotal to the plot and the theme of judging by character rather than class (and also the theme of the inevitable links between class).Likewise with the smooth faux-childish Harold Skimpole.Fourth, it moves the big and clumsy action along rippingly.  Quick jump-cuts, rapid changes, and unusual camera angles zoom the plots along at a rapid clip.This is the brilliant version of ""Bleak House"" I have been waiting for.

328387,"If you're of a certain age, you'll recall duck-and-cover drills when your teachers told you to slide under your desk, face away from the windows, and cover your head.  These exercises were practice, just in case the Soviet Union decided to drop an atomic bomb or two while you were learning your times tables.  This was the 1950's, a time of nationwide paranoia about the Bomb.""The Atomic Cafe"" is a wonderfully nostalgic, often hilarious documentary about those days when the government produced instructional films about how to survive a nuclear attack, with announcers in stentorian tones assuring Americans that anyone can withstand a nuclear attack if simple rules were followed.  Director Kevin Rafferty has assembled in this 1982 film vintage clips, music from military training films, campy advertisements, presidential speeches, and pop songs that revolve around the apprehension surrounding the relatively new atomic bomb.What makes the movie a hoot today is the propaganda and lopsided optimism of the Fabulous Fifties.  The editing creates much of the film's irony, such as footage of a totally leveled Hiroshima braided into suburban duck-and-cover routines with actors who look like June and Ward Cleaver's next-door neighbors.  However, the film also illustrates how pervasive America's obsession with the new bomb was and how advertisers latched onto the word ""atomic"" the way they later embraced the phrase ""new and improved.""""The Atomic Cafe"" has more than its share of jaw-dropping moments.  Average folks compare a nuclear holocaust to a tornado that rages for a few seconds and then quickly calms down.  A California man proudly states that after most of his neighbors die in an attack by the Soviets, extra food will be available for prepared families like his.  A happy, middle-class American family heads for their bomb shelter, equipped with a periscope.  Two school girls display twelve Mason jars filled with bomb shelter provisions they made in their home economics class.  The sense one gets is that nuclear war was sold to the American people as a bearable inconvenience, not unlike a two-hour power outage.The icing on the cake in this two-disc Collector's Edition is eight complete government propaganda films, including ""Self Preservation in an Atomic Attack"" (1950), ""Duck and Cover"" (1951), and ""Our Cities Must Fight"" (1951).  These black-and-white movies are both funny and creepy in that they were shown all over America and peddled distorted ideas about the potency not only of the atomic bomb itself, but of the devastating effects of radiation poisoning.",The Atomic Cafe VHS

260464,"In the wake of Charlton Heston's death, I decided to have a marathon viewing of his films. I rewatched many of my favorites and sought out some of those I had never seen.""Planet of the Apes"" is an iconic film and one of my longtime favorites. Heston stars as Taylor, an astronaut who crashes on a planet ruled by talking apes. Here humans are mute and primitive, treated like animals. Taylor is an anomaly that perplexes and frightens the apes (imagine us discovering an intelligent ape who could speak). The scientists want to study him, the superstitious leaders want to destroy him.Although it may seem like a mindless sci-fi movie on the surface, ""Apes"" deals with heavy themes like prejudice, social class, and the nuclear threat. With one exception (see next paragraph), it is well written, beautifully shot, and artfully directed. The film is full of great scenes: the astronauts' journey across the hauntingly bleak landscape, the chilling ""hunting party"" attack, and of course the famous twist ending. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is discordant and clangy, but it creates the perfect mood of otherworldly menace. Heston turns in one of his best performances (""Get your stinking hands off me . . ."").However, for such an intelligent film, there is one ludicrous plot hole: though he believes he is on a planet far from earth, Taylor never once questions why the apes speak perfect English! It is inconceivable that he wouldn't wonder how this ""alien"" society speaks his language or uses remarkably familiar weapons like rifles.If you can overlook this error, ""Apes"" is really an enjoyable film, certainly much better than the misguided 2003 remake. It is a classic of science fiction and a must-see for any Heston fan.",Planet of the Apes VHS

446425,"I have loved this series ever since I was a young boy who saw the original movie on TV.  When the TV series came out, I was glued to the set for every episode, and then the cartoon series became a part of my regular Saturday morning viewing.  This is one of the few movie franchises that I loved growing up that has not lost any of its charm with me now as an adult.  I first bought the Limited Edition Evolution collection on DVD a few years ago, and followed up with my purchase of the Ultimate Collection that came enclosed in a bust of Caesar.  When I first heard of the arrival of this series on Blu-ray, I thought they would simply transport the DVD versions I already owned onto a Blu-ray platter.  BOY was I wrong!!!!!I will not go into the details of the story line for this series, since so many have already done a great job at that.  What I will focus on is the Blu-ray 40th Anniversary Collection.I had seen pictures of the collection, and was very excited to get my own copy, but I had never actually seen a copy of it in the stores.  Because of that, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with regarding the quality of the set.  I had just recently been MAJORLY disappointed with Fox's horrible Blu-ray box set of the Omen series (another favorite of mine).  The packaging for that set was one of the worst I have ever seen on any format.  But I digress....this is not a review of the Omen set.  Let's start with the outer box.  It is of very sturdy construction with the spaceship on the cover in textured relief.  The box serves what appears to be a hard bound book.  You slide that out of the cover, and it opens to reveal a detailed timeline of the entire Ape film series.  Each gatefold of the timeline then opens to reveal the discs which are attached to the backboard with these clear rubber hubs.  I will admit that the hubs proved to be frustrating at first, because I could not get the discs back onto the hubs to secure them before closing the package.  While this is my only complaint about the entire set, I found that instead of trying to force the discs straight down onto the hubs, it works MUCH better to place the disc on the hub and then give it a gentle twist which easily secures it.  While I have some reservations about the choice to use these rubber hubs to hold the discs, I have to admit that it really does look great when the package is all together.  The only other thing included in the package is a book that chronicles the entire film series.  But wait....this is no typical listing of special features with a brief synopsis of each film.  This book is a substantial 200 page overview of this timeless series.  The production value of this book is top notch!!!  It is the best I have ever seen in a movie set.  What makes this book truly special, is that it was produced exclusively for this Blu-ray collection.  You may browse the book with it still attached to the package, or you can easily slide it out to look at it on its own.  All of the packaging for this set is constructed from very sturdy cardboard and it all works together to serve as an excellent means of presenting the true star of the set, the 5 Blu-ray discs that comprise the film series.If you have ever had doubts about jumping into the Blu-ray high def pool, this set serves as an example for what this format is capable of.  The wealth of information on the first disc alone is truly staggering!!!  Not only does it include all of the special features that were included on the 2-disc DVD, it also adds some fantastic special features that are unique to the Blu-ray format.  One of those features is the ability to watch the feature long documentary as it was originally presented or you may choose to watch it in Interactive Mode where you are presented with extra text and video features.  You also get the Science of the Apes Bonusview which is a picture-in-picture feature that can be viewed while watching the first film.  One of the other cool features was the ability to actually read newspapers which served as props in the original movie.  You first get to see the paper as seen in the movie, then you use your remote to choose which article you would like to read.  Finally the entire text of the article is presented in an easy to read text format.  This may not be for everyone, but as a longtime fan, I enjoyed it.  I could go on and on with all the special features of the 1st disc, but you can get that information elsewhere.  While the first film does deservedly get the royal treatment with special features, Fox did not simply slap the previous DVD version of the other 4 films on a new format, and throw them together.  It is amazing that Fox took the time to present these other 4 Ape films in what I consider the best video and audio I've ever experienced them in.  Each film also gets its own documentary, while not as extensive as the original, each one is more than just a puff piece of each film.  As a longtime fan, I have been dying to see some nice extra features for the other films in the franchise.  In addition to some nice extra features, you also get the opportunity to watch ""Conquest"" and ""Battle"" in either the original theatrical version, or an expanded version.  While there was an extended version of ""Conquest"" in the Ultimate Collection DVD set, this is the first time we have been given the opportunity to see the extended version of ""Battle"".  It has been mentioned in previous releases, but it was thrilling for me to finally get to see it.BOTTOM LINE:  I will concede that the sound on these discs cannot compare to those of such blockbusters as Transformers or Iron Man, but if you are an Ape fan and have been looking for a definitive collection of the franchise, then I wholeheartedly recommend that you get this collection on Blu-ray.  These films have never looked and sounded better, and I am thrilled with all of the extra features that are available for each film.  This is hands down the greatest Blu-ray collection yet created, and I think it will stand the test of time as other studios follow suit.  Even with the little complaint about the rubber hubs holding the discs, I have no reservations in recommending this to any Ape fan who has recently jumped into the Blu-ray pool of high definition movie viewing.",Planet of the Apes Collection VHS

1093784,"The Film Crew consists of three alumni of the great movie-mocking TV show, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. The premise for this project is not that Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett are trapped in an orbiting satellite; instead, they're three lowly employees at a DVD distributor, charged by their boss to create a commentary track for every movie they release, no matter how obscure or painful.This is the fourth (and -- so far -- final) release from The Film Crew.  When the list of four films was initially announced, this was the one I was most looking forward to as it was the only movie I had actually seen in its original form.THE GIANT OF MARATHONisn't a completely awful film.  I think the worst thing that could be is that it's simply dull in the non-battle sequences.Steve Reeves stars in this sword and sandal movie.  While Reeves had played Hercules in two other films, here he is portraying Philippides -- the Greek soldier who is said to have run the entire 26.2 miles from the Battle of Marathon to Athens to deliver the news of victory.  However, you won't have to tax your mind too much with the difference; the character of Philippides is virtually identical to the Hercules character from earlier films.I had been anticipating this DVD and I ultimately was not disappointed.  The Film Crew's jokes at the expense of the production are very funny.  I'd say that this disc andKILLERS FROM SPACEwere the strongest two of the four in terms of quality comedy.I'd like to see more of these straight-to-DVD releases from The Film Crew, although from what I've read on the Internet that doesn't seem likely.  Just getting these four discs released seems to have been a hassle with the distribution rights bouncing away from Rhino Entertainment and (eventually) into the ownership of Shout Factory (note that whenever the characters mention the name of their boss, the dubbing says ""Bob Honcho"" while their lips say ""Bob Rhino"").  With these three ex-MST3k members now seemingly wrapped up in their work with RiffTrax, GIANT OF MARATHON may be the last outing we see in this incarnation of movie mocking.

The acting too, is not bad, and for the first fifteen minutes I watched in happy anticipation. Then the rot set in. The storyline took a tremendous dip, from which it never recovered.  Suffice to say there's nothing uplifting about this story, and the only characters in it who enjoyed the least success and attainment of life's goals were the ones who least deserved it. I'm really not a great fan of bait and switch ads in movies, where a movie purports to be one thing, and when you come to see it, it's quite another. Obviously they didn't feel they could sell the story as it was.  I also couldn't believe the premise of the story, that it required at least two people to be so completely without conscience, not just for a moment, but through horrendous consequences, and that Cee was so ineffectual that she couldn't have explained the situation or got at at least one of the accusers to get to the truth.  Even the end of the movie has a twisting deception as to the outcome laid out in the middle, so to speak, so it's not just the previews that were misleading. On the whole, if you like movies that both deceive and concern deceivers, this is the movie for you. If you're looking for something more positive, stay away.",N/A
1171884,"Sure I get knocked for my liking of Sean Bean, but he wasn't the only reason for my purchase of Far North.  This beautiful, yet creepy and tragic 2007 film based on a story from Sara Maitland's collection Far North and Other Dark Tales will have you awing and grimacing at the screen.Saiva (Michelle Yeoh) was cursed as a child and cast from her village. Once she finds happiness with a neighboring tribe, tragedy follows her again. She rescues Anja (Michelle Krusiec) and raises her into the ravages of the artic, away from society and all its evils. One day, however, Saiva helps Loki (Sean Bean), a freezing soldier lost in the artic wilderness. Saiva warns Anja not to be charmed by the first man she's met. Both women, however, fall for Loki, and disaster follows.Folks who've read my reviews know I don't like to spoil a film experience, but where Far North is concerned, I really can't tell you anything else about the story. My husband thought the obvious of oft villain Sean Bean (Patriot Games, Goldeneye), ""He kills them, right?"" I countered with, ""No, they have threeways."" Both are plausible scenarios to the modern viewer, but the things you expect most in Far North aren't the things that happen. BAFTA winning director Asif Kapadia (The Return) and co screenwriter Tim Miller (The Warrior) have taken Maitland's tiny story and stretched into a philosophical and disturbing little statement. The film rises and falls upon Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Tomorrow Never Dies) and she is up to the task as the tormented Saiva. Some of the flashbacks trying to make her look younger seem out of place, but Yeoh's silent looks and stilted dialogue are perfection. It's a shame most Americans don't get to see most of her work; I've enjoyed every film in which I've seen Yeoh. She can act. We believe Saiva is a tough woman who can brave this horrid landscape, and yet we know she is capable of compassion. There isn't a lot of dialogue among the three leads, Far North feels more like a play. Camera angles and expressions sell the story, and when words are spoken, they are forceful and take on more than face value meanings. Newcomer Michelle Krusiec (Dirty Sexy Money) steps up to the plate as Anja. She's young, disenchanted with this rugged lifestyle. Anja's been aged by the artic yet is still very young and juvenile in comparison with the outside word. And of course there's Sean Bean. I often wish he had more to do in some of his smaller roles, (NBC's recent Crusoe especially) but here, Sean Bean gives us just enough to like Loki, wonder about him, and question his feelings towards both ladies.Despite fine performances all around, the incredible artic location is what makes Far North. The ice, cold water, white snow; Norway is the picture of beauty and the face of danger. Hypothermia, jagged rock cliffs, falling ice; Any number of natural disasters-or the viles of people-could harm you and there's no escape, no help for hundred of miles. I wouldn't say it is as exceptional as Platoon, but Far North reminds me of Oliver Stone's Oscar winning Vietnam Epic. It's so visually horrifying and disturbing that you don't really want to watch it again, but you can't look away either. Folks who are sensitive to animal plights might want to skip a few scenes in Far North. Seeing women kill dogs and seals is very upsetting to a lot of people, but we must remember in the arctic, this is a way of life.As realistic as Far North's unforgiving locations are-and the behind the scenes documentary on the DVD tells us exactly how difficult it was for the cast and crew-there's also something very ambiguous about the story. It's only ninety minutes, but it seems longer, and has a very questionable but not unsatisfying ending. Far North reads like a fable; a tale told to children warning of consequences and humanity. Loki is the Norse God of mischief. Is he even real? In this far away place at the edge of the world, has Saiva somehow crossed to another realm? One is not even sure when Far North actually takes place. Russian soldiers are persecuting native tribes, but is their presence meant to be taken as an historical marker or are they representative of the evils of society?Not that he is a particularly glamorous actor, but Sean Bean plays perhaps his least pretty role here. He's hypothermic and bundled up for most of the film, and when he strips down, it's not his usual action hero form. Sharpe fans and Sean Bean Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ladies will joke that it's that because Sean Bean has entered these women's lives that causes all the trouble. But it's more than that. It's the mere fact that a man, such a mysterious man, any man really could cause such catastrophe for these two women. Even if you don't know about the shape shifting promiscuous Norse Loki, Far North doesn't give easy answers. On my first viewing, I was so horrified by Far North, I didn't even realize Sean Bean was in the buff. In the Artic? I was too busy screaming at the television screen. It's not something I normally do, and after my father heard me, I sent him into a viewing of Far North cold turkey. His verdict? ""Horrible film. I liked it!""Unfortunately, not a lot of people have seen Far North. It's done well in the festival circuit, and even the making of documentary had garnered accolades, but Far North has yet to see even a limited release or theater distribution. The DVD is available online, and Far North even opened the first annual Philadelphia Asian-American Film Festival. Far North is not exclusively an ethnic film, nor am I certain it is merely an art house picture as its history would seem. Is Far North a horror movie? Quite possibly. It definitely gave me the chills and had me screaming. When was the last time a real horror film did that?",Far North
1095045,"I enjoyed the first Hostel movie due to it's entertainment/shock value.  It was actually pretty funny, but at the same time it had very ominous undertones.  Hostel 2 however, is a much better movie in my opinion.  Director/Writer Eli Roth really put a lot into this movie.  This movie had smarter characters, smarter plot points, and it was executed better.  Roth made the smartest decision of all when he decided to continue the storyline started in the first Hostel.  Too many movies have attempted to do too much with sequals, instead of sticking to what the movie is supposed to be.  Lets face it, everyone that watches Hostel 2 knows exactly what to expect.  It wouldn't be Hostel if the characters don't end up being tortured by the Elite Hunting Club.  Friday the 13th has to have Jason Voorhees chopping up horny camp counselors.  The point is that Eli Roth was smart not to try to ""one up"" himself.  He stuck to the story, and added to it.  Yes we get torture in the movie.  Yes that is no surprise.  However we also get a few other aspects of the Hostel world.  We get an Elite Hunting Club leader added to the story.  We get an upgraded Elite Hunting Club security since the first protagonist took advantage of their weak security.  We get a group of girls being lured this time.  This means that promises of sex will not cut it.  Eli Roth wrote these girls so well.  I truly believed these characters, and what drove them to the ultimate goal.  The best addition to Hostel 2 was the two American business men going on their maiden voyage to the factory of torture.  These guys were so fun to watch.  You could truly see what would drive guys like this to commit the ultimate sin.  Also very believable characters.  The acting was superb from the whole cast.  The girls that do end up getting the nastiness in the factory make these scenes work.  It was thier acting ability that made the scenes real.  Eli Roth used so much symbolism throughout the movie to foreshadow what was coming.  The thing I am most impressed with about Hostel 2 is the underlying themes of Capitalism.  This movie shows that money makes the world go around and those who have the money have the power.  Brilliant.",N/A

The way they do it should be determined by the times...and the times have changed.Transformers was put into the capable hands of Michael Bay sometime in 2005.  From that point, when he finally agreed to do it (which might have been right after he watched his last movie `The Island' fall flat on it's face) he ran with it whole heartedly.  The best part is, he listened to many fans about the old series and characters and integrated some things into the movie.  However, the one thing he DID NOT listen to (and I'm glad he didn't) was the transformation of the robots.  This movie shows it happening realistically.  I mean, you really get to see the pieces and parts moving around and reforming to the point where you wonder if they just melded the CGI parts together and made it look good without function.  I'm telling you now, that is not the case.  Everything had a place to go...watching the special features on the DVD you see the animators creating CAD (that Computer Aided Drafting, boys and girls) drawings showing where all parts of the characters went.  It's truly amazing!Now, on to the flick itself.  In one word, it really is awesome.  I have watched it a few times now and it actually gets better each time.  Let me clarify off the bat that this is a popcorn movie.  Not to be taken too seriously but the movie itself doesn't take itself seriously most of the time either.  So it all works out.  The plot follows Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a somewhat gawky but still kinda cool geek who's got a plan...buy a car, impress the girl.  In this case, the girl is Mikaela Banes (played by ultra hot Megan Fox).  When buying his car he is nudged into buying a beat up 77 Camaro Hot Rod, little knowing that it hides a secret.  Eventually the car reveals itself to be Bumblebee, a scout soldier for the Autobots; one half of an alien species from a planet called Cybertron that is extremely high tech.  The other half are the Decepticons, who are devoted to tyranny as opposed to the Autobots who are freedom fighters and defenders of good.  Bumblebee is sent to not only protect Sam but to signal other Autobots once he has found him.A secondary plot follows a Helicoptor and  Scorpion like Decepticons that attack a Military outpost in Katar in the Middle East.  This gets the Military and Secretary of Defense involved as they try to figure out what hacked into their computer systems.  Josh Dumahl leads a small group of soldiers who survived the attack and make it back stateside giving their experience expertise on the aliens.  As the movie moves forward we find that Sam's ancestor actually discovered the first Decepticon on Earth, frozen in the artic.  Sam has a map, etched in the glass of a pair of his ancestors spectacles which will lead them to the `Allspark', an Implement of power which can turn the tide in the war between the two halves.So as the chase starts and the Decepticons track down Sam, he meets Optimus Prime; the leader of the Autobots.  From there they are intercepted by Sector 7, an ultra top secret government organization that has been keeping the existence of the first Decepticon a secret for quite some time.  From there, the story goes to the Hoover Dam where they are shown Megatron, the one found in the Arctic so many years ago.  This is where everything starts to come together and all characters join up complete the common goal.  Get the Allspark and keep it out of Decepitcons hands.  The actions sequences are spectacular and the melding of the CG animation and live action is seamless and truly believable.  The showdown in Mission City at the end is chaotic, kinetic and downright mind blowing.  You cannot deny the intensity and excitement of the battle scenes.Even though most of the performances in this movie are pretty undemanding, everyone seems to be in the spirit and having a great time.  LeBeouf, Fox and Turturro do have some great moments.  Especially LeBeouf, whose comedic wit shines in many places and lightens what could have been a drool, horny caricature of your typical teenager.  Fox does well too playing it straight against his goofiness at times.  She also has what a friend of mine stated was the best special effect in the movie...her body.  I am a great fan of Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg's individual work.  Both like to do things in their own style and are not usually subject to letting others tell them how to make their movies.  So I was very happy to see such spectacular product come from their union.  There are a couple of scenes that scream Spielberg's influence but hey, when you're the Executive Producer and have a couple of Oscars under your belt, you kinda get your way.  But other than that, it's good to see Bay growing even more with his craft.  This is by far his best movie overall.",Transformers
916518,"Prom Night II is not exactly a direct sequel to Prom Night I. However I did not like any of the other Prom Night movies, except for this one, and maybe the 3rd one.As said, it's not a direct sequel, usually when horror movies are a success and they use the name to make another one in hopes the name alone can sell it, they usually get bashed by reviews and dismissed as cheap B-grade movies.Hello Mary-Lou is not that case. This movie is one people can truly say it's a sequel better then the original.The movie is about a woman named Mary Lou who is a tramp. Her boyfriend she goes to the prom with becomes very unhappy when he finds she will not do it with him, but he finds her going all the way with someone else backstage of the prom.Mary-Lou falls victim to a death that pays homage to ""Carrie"". She is burned in a fire and dies. Years later she returns to the school and possesses a young girl to seek revenge on those who killed her, and to finally enjoy her prom queen status, all while the typical things like people finding out and running around after her trying to stop it all.If anyone tells you this movie is a rip off of Carrie and a few other horror movies, they need to know that, this movie is not a rip off. It was paying homage to classic horror films. It was a collection of different horror flicks rolled into one for this story.Looking at it now, it's not the worlds greatest horror movie, but it's cool, it's funny and very enjoyable. Tho I first remember coming home one day when I was very young and my older brother was watching this, and the locker room scene scared the hell out of me as a kid, which is why I wanted to see it again a few years back ... and second time around, it was a great movie, and fun.There is combination available on DVD for Prom Night 2 & 3.

1194425,"""You live into a bubble; don't know how the world is"". These are the last words after an unpleasant discussion between this veteran of Intelligence service and his ex-wife about giving permission his daughter of just seventeen to make a travel for Paris.Written by Luc Besson and directed by a young director, Peter Morel, this thriller is told according the basic rules of this genre. It carves in relief the state of things in which the daughter of a divorced couple plans to make a trip to Paris in company of her friend Amanda (secretly they have decided to follow the musical schedule to U2), but his father who worked into the Intelligence Service is well aware about the dangerous situation.Liam Neeson (an actor of multiple artistic skills who should be more requested) makes a very credible performance acting like the avenger father who will travel to Paris breaking any kind of law to find her, because he just has 80 hours to avoid she was sent to other destinies.Full action, marvelous car chases, brutal violence and bloody scenes make this movie an admirable vehicle of entertainment.Somehow this movie made me remind that psycho thriller of the 80's Frantic directed by Polanski and acted by Harrison Ford, in which his wife is kidnapped, in Paris.",Taken
328653,"The fourth one of the series, though I have taken them the wrong way. This is the first one. Margaret Rutherford was still trying her hand at the part and she apparently liked it and even enjoyed it. The murder is obnoxious. The murderer is unforeseen and absolutely vicious. It is pure greed with a good tinge of lust, the lust of the middle-aging man who wants to get some fresh flesh and cool blood, or is it hot actually? The murderer is of course the outsider who is intruding with the life of the people who are soon going to be his competitors, though by his own choice. So he finds it interesting to eliminate a few. But Margaret or is she Jane is or is it are looking after the business and protecting the innocent. The film is thus well done and well acted. But this one has, like the others, a special and unique knack and that knack comes from Alexander, the teenager. He is a brilliant little gentleman without any face hair yet, aristocratic enough to be funny and cultivated enough to be witty. And he is used wisely and his antics are just fun and fine. That's what I would call the Christie-an touch in that film and the director added a touch of his own in the real setting he worked on in London, the old Victoria Station that has been refurbished and cleaned up so much since then it does not have that quaint charm of 1961. It is true it will never be revolutionized by the Eurostar but it has changed so much already that we will never have it the way it was any more.

648596,"The 2006 film ""We Are Marshall"", directed by McG, is a story based upon a true & tragic event: the November 14, 1970 crash of an airliner resulting in the deaths of nearly the entire football team of Marshall University along with nearly the entire coaching staff and many other victims.  Only a handful of team members were not on board, including Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) and Tom Bogdan (Brian Geraghty).  With the entire town of Huntington, West Virginia in mourning following the crash, Nate organizes the students to rally the school's board to continue the football program rather than suspend it as Paul Griffen (Ian McShane), head of the board, wants to do because his son Chris (Wes Brown) was killed in the crash.  However, Paul Griffen and university president Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn) relent and decide to continue the program.  After many failed attempts at finding a new football coach, Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) of the University of Wooster applies for the job and gets it.  Under his leadership, he and one of the original coaching staff, Red Dawson (Matthew Fox), train a new team comprised of almost all freshmen as the new Marshall University football team.This film, which is a tribute to the football team that died in 1970, the students of Mashall University, Jack Lengyel, Nate Ruffin and the new freshmen football team of 1971, is an emotional, engaging & well-written film.  With wonderful cinematography, a gripping story and moving characters, ""We Are Marshall"" deserves a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  Other memorable characters include Annie Cantrell (Kate Mara), Carole Dawson (January Jones) and surviving team member Reggie Oliver (Arlen Escarpeta).",N/A

Sun Chien doesn't get to throw a single punch or kick, which would be ok if it was an awesome movie like Human Lanters, but in House of Traps it made me really mad.

88564,"Elia Kazan's ""Streetcar Named Desire"" is a wonderful interpretation of William's classic play.  Like many of Tennessee William's plays ""Streetcar"" depicts the moral ruination of the post-civil war South.  Blanche Dubois, in particular, is tragic and represents a ""belle idee"" gone hopelessly wrong.  We learn how she has tried but failed to hold the old family home and honor intact.  As a school teacher in Oriole, Mississippi she has failed in the most terrible way possible.  She has not only prostituted herself but has seduced young school-age boys.  As a consequence, despite her faded aristocracy, she has been run out of town and wound up on the doorstep of her sister, a woman quite content to reach for the gutter.Her Pollack brother-in-law, played by Marlon Brando, is so miserable that he's great.  He takes every opportunity to insult his freeloading sister-in-law and--with his wife in the hospital having a baby--he plumbs the depths of his own depravity and rapes the frightened and increasingly confused Blanche.Blanche, who had a fleeting opportunity to marry the naive Karl Maldon, sees her opportunity torn away from her when Maldon learns the black truth of her Oriole history.  Blanche retreats into madness.  She finally meets her aristocratic savior in the form of an elderly physician who arrives to take her to a mental institution.

830032,"This is an excellent film about the beginnings of Protestantism. It is well acted and respectful of the history involved. It does not sugar coat Luther or the factions involved with his movement.

This is a great historical drama and should be of interest to those who are not particularly religious. From what I can gather, its is quite accurate historically.

667668,"The Fourth Season of the X-Files continues to develop the ""mythology"" plot points of earlier season, while also churning out quality ""stand-alone"" episodes (despite a few more clunkers than usual).  Let's examine the three types of episode formats that the X-Files showcases:1. Mythology: During this season, a Mars rock turns out to be something more than just terrestrial, the Russians begin experimenting with an alien virus, Max Fenig (last seen in Season 1) makes a return appearance, and Mulder again must choose what to believe surrounding the events of his sister's disappearance.  Though the ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"" two-part episode falls a bit flat, the other mythology episodes this season are as strong as ever.  Perhaps the most important mythological developement of this season, however, is Agent Scully's contraction of a deadly disease which may have been given to her by outside forces.2. Stand-Alone: Despite a few clunker episodes that were not present in earlier seasons, this season continued to produce compelling hour-long stories.  ""Unruhe"" focuses on a genuinely terrifying pyschopath, ""Home"" is so scary that it almost wasn't shown at all, and ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"" sheds some light on the shadowy figure's younger years.3. Comedic: While ""Never Again"" is very hit-or-miss depending on who you ask, ""Small Potatoes"" is a hilarious romp that also serves to provide the first hints (however small) of a possible Mulder-Scully romantic relationship.Overall, the Fourth Season of the X-Files continued to give fans what they wanted...more mythology to endlessly debate online, spooky paranormal creates, and a few hearty laughs.  Also, though I am no expert in this department, the show seemed to have been shot on better film starting this season, as the picture is more crisp and the special effects more incredible.",N/A
946319,"Visually beautiful with attractive and believable stars who work well together, this sci-fi action movie blends intelligent concepts with a briskly moving plot to offer viewers a breathtaking view into the not so far off future, now.  Ewan McGregor was excellent as the childlike and curious Lincoln, and also is a convincing supercilious jerk as his owner, in a dual role.  Scarlett Johansson is perfect as the nymph-woman, a role which would take quite a bit of depth to carry off as well as she does, a subtle and understated performance, with her innocence being crucial to the mercenary, played by Djimon Hounsou, in realizing his essential truth.  The mind blowing special effects scenes with the train wheels and the falling sign are seamlessly integrated into real life action, like, how did they do that without someone getting creamed?  Steve Buscemi adds both a lightheartedness and a dark comedy of horrors feel that the movie needed in order to make the transition from the ultra-hygienic, synthetic world to the real, gritty one, believable.

428647,"The famous Victor Hugo story has been filmed so many times since the silent film era (like the 1923 version ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" starring Lon Chaney as Quasimodo, deformed bell ringer of Notre Dame Cathedral). Now you are looking at the 1997 made-for-TV version which I find fairly entertaining even though you can hardly call it a faithful adaptation. But anyway, I didn't like the original story's ending very much.Mandy Patinkin is Quasimodo with special make-up. Salma Hayek is Esmeralda (with several dancing scenes that are downplayed for TV) while Richard Harris is Frollo, archdeacon obsessed with his love, or lust, for Esmeralda. Three major actors are all very good, especially late Richard Harris showing a completely different turn from that of benign Professor Dumbledore, but you may regret the lack of character development in them.Some characters of the book are missing to make room for the story of the major ones and some incidents are drastically changed. A murder is committed, but in an entirely differently way, making the murderer's motive much less convincing. But they managed to put in a goat.The Emmy-nominated production designs are decent, but the streets of Paris sometimes look more like some village in Eastern Europe (where it was actually shot). But maybe that was intentional. Perhaps you may prefer Charles Laughton's Quasimodo, but this version has its moments.",Hunchback VHS

449804,"Gone with the Wind (Victor Fleming, 1939)I have hated Gone with the Wind for decades based on little snatches of it that I've seen here and there over a long period of time. I thought that, perhaps, I might be giving it short shrift, so a few nights ago, I sat down to watch the entire four-hour extravaganza from beginning to end. It somehow doesn't surprise me that I now hate the film in an entirely new, more passionate, more comprehensive way than I did previously.My main bone of contention is not that the film is far, far too long for the skimpy subject matter it explores-- an hour and a half running time might have helped immensely-- but that Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, in the final ninety minutes of the film, break the cardinal rule-- they manage to screw everything up by simply not talking. These are incredibly stupid, shallow people. Why have generations wasted four hours on this twaddle? And why do some do it every year? I've heard many people refer to it as a great romance; maybe this is a good portion of what's wrong with America today. If this is your idea of a great romance, folks, then perhaps you need to go back to the well and think a little more about what constitutes a great romance. I'm pretty sure that philandering, jealousy, all the character depth of a piece of onionskin, and a decided lack of intelligence should not be contributing factors.While the visual spectacle of the thing is inarguable, everything else about it-- the pace, the characterization, the script, all of it-- are just plain awful.

85146,"I really must admit that I'm torn over what I think of this film.  Having missed it in theaters, I managed to catch it a couple of weeks ago at my neighbors' house.  Honestly, other than knowing it had won the Best Picture Oscar, I really didn't have a clue what the movie was about before watching it, other than having something to do with a drug deal gone wrong.  The story grabs the viewer right from the beginning, and slowly you start to piece together what is going on.  I like it when directors allow me to use my brain to figure things out, instead of just spoon feeding me the plot.  As the film progressed, I became more and more involved with the characters and the story.  When we took a popcorn break, we discussed how much we were enjoying the movie, and how surprised we all were that it was this good.  The cinematography is really something to see in this film.  It's not Lawrence of Arabia good, but it is quality work.  The acting is solid from the leads to the supporting cast.  Tommy Lee Jones never disappoints, and Javier Bardem, whom I had never seen before, gives a truly chilling performance.  Bardem's acting prowess was such that I have begun to search out his previous films.  So with all this praise, why do I not give this movie a perfect score???  THAT is my quandary.  While 98% of the movie blew me away, it's the ending.....or lack of one, that leaves me a little disappointed.  Just when things seemed to be headed for a rewarding climax, it ends.  This left me with MANY unanswered questions.  But as time has passed I have asked myself it that was the intention of the creators of the film, because even though we were all not happy with the ending, we have discussed what we thought happened since our viewing.  If I could give it 3.5 stars I would.  It is a great piece of film, but it was just personally disappointing to me because of the ending.

1071858,"Act of Violence (1948):Act of Violence is a film that tries to be more than what it can deliver. It tries to be a significant film, as Hollywood defines ""significant,"" of weakness and obsession, with a bit of irony and, of course, redemption at the end. It fails, in my opinion, because the dramatic core of the movie is as earnest, unlikely and melodramatic as the plots of most $3.98 remainder novels. Fred Zinnemann directed some well-crafted movies such asThe Day of the JackalandHigh Noon (Collector's Edition). He also made a number of highly popular, long and dull movies. What makes Act of Violence interesting is the performances of the two leads, Van Heflin and Robert Ryan. Both were fine actors.Heflin plays Frank Enley, a successful small town businessman with an attractive wife and a small child. He's a nice guy with a secret that leaves him in turmoil. Robert Ryan plays Joe Parkson, Enley's worst nightmare. In a German POW camp Enley betrayed a group of men who were planning to escape. He thought he had a promise that nothing would happen to the men. They were, of course, all shot. Parkson somehow survived. Now, after the war, Parkson has only one purpose in life...to find Frank Enley and make him pay with his life for what he did.If it weren't for Heflin's earnest desperation and furrowed angst, something he did better than most actors, and Ryan's fierce anger and internalized tenseness, something he did better than most, we'd have a long slog until we reach the point where final payment is made and life, we hope, can go on. The movie, for me, seems more and more contrived and trivial as the time goes by.Heflin is probably not thought about much nowadays. He was very good, in my opinion, as the hapless Charles Bovary inMadame Bovary (1949), the hardworking Joe Starrett inShane, and the determined and nervous Dan Evans in3:10 to Yuma (Special Edition). He didn't have the looks, as he pointed out himself (think of an honorable-looking, reasonably handsome J. Edgar Hoover, if that's possible), so he concentrated on his acting. Ryan, on the other hand, is usually recognized as one of film's outstanding lead and character actors. For subtlety and vulnerability, tryOn Dangerous Ground; for nastiness, tryBad Day at Black Rock; for deliberate evil, tryBilly Budd; for tired resignation, tryThe Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition).Mystery Street (1950):When the body is found on the beach, no one knows except us who it is. We know it's a cheap, no-good call girl named Vivian Helton because we watched her, desperate for money, meet the man who owed her, and who shot her. Now she's not only lost her looks, she's lost her flesh. Sand and waves have left nothing but bones. The cop in charge, Lieutenant Pete Morales (Ricardo Montalban), calls on Dr. McAdoo (Bruce Bennett), a forensic scientist at Harvard, to help with identification. In the process of establishing sex, age, height and occupation (possible dancer, not probable call girl), we'll get a lesson in forensics that would do credit to Kay Scarpetta or the Skeleton Detective himself, Gideon Oliver.Then the police learn Vivian Helton was pregnant. Pete Morales, working his first case in Boston, had earlier made up his mind that Vivian was murdered before there was evidence to establish this. Now he's determined to find the murderer. Morales is a good guy...smart, ambitious, cheerful, hard working. But when he decides someone is guilty, he's not about to change his mind. Before he gets things right, he'll get things wrong.Along the way we'll meet Henry Shanway, the poor drunk sap who met Vivian at a bar while he was feeling sorry for himself. He let her move his yellow Ford from a no-parking zone. The next thing he knew they were on the Cape, where she tricked him out of the car so she could drive off and meet the man who will shoot her. We'll meet Henry's wife, too. There's Vivian's eccentric and venal landlady (played by Elsa Lanchester), who thinks she can pick up the blackmailing where Vivian left off. And, of course, there's the killer. Most importantly, perhaps, there's McAdoo. Turns out that with his knowledge of bones, bullet angles and logic, he's a better detective than anyone else.The movie benefits from the moody cinematography of John Alton and the efficient direction of John Sturges, Sturges moved on to direct such successes as Last Train from Gun Hill, The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape and Ice Station Zebra. Mystery Street is a solid entry. It's not an A movie, but it's interesting, unsentimental, well made and shorter.",Act of Violence / Mystery Street
186028,"The time-honored ""man and woman stuck on a desert island"" scenario is served up with a heaping tablespoon of class struggle and an acidic twist of sexual politics in this controversial 1975 film from Italian director Lena Wertmuller. A shrill and haughty bourgeoisie woman (Mariangela Melato) charters a yacht cruise for herself and her equally obnoxious fascist friends, who all seem to delight in belittling their slovenly deck hand (Giancarlo Giannini), who is a card-carrying communist. Fate and circumstance conspire to strand Melato and Giannini together on a small Mediterranean isle, setting the stage for some interesting role reversal games (with definite S&M overtones, I should warn you). This film has a polarizing effect on viewers, which I think can be attributed to its fascinating feminist dilemma: How does one react to an obviously talented and self-assured female director with unmistakably misogynist leanings?

1112540,"The Good: Not much.  The one small glimmer of light in this otherwise black hole of a movie is Michael Cera (Evan).  The guy's just likable in a sweet, dorky way.  While there are some chuckles in the film, they are far overshadowed by the absolute cringe-worthy language and the absolute annoyance of Jonah Hill.The Bad: Where to start?  A young boy obsessed with drawing male genitalia ... what does that have to do with ANYTHING?  I think it was supposed to be funny but it wasn't.  And it was kind of like one of those trademark Family Guy moments where they intentionally overdue something inane ... except I don't think it was intentional here.  The language in this movie is abominable.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a total prude but the f-bomb is used in this movie like I use the article ""the.""  It's beyond gratuitous.  About fifteen to twenty minutes into the movie we considered turning it off but we stuck through to the end, just waiting to see if it ever ""picked up.""  It didn't.The Summary:  So what exactly is the point of this movie?  Well in a nutshell, it's one of those coming of age movies disguised as a gross-out movie, stealthily hiding a warm and fuzzy friendship tale.  As with most movies of this type, the two main teenage characters, Seth and Evan, are desperately trying to get laid.  In pursuit of this, they must bring alcohol to a party they've managed to get invited to despite their obvious dorkiness.  Helping them in this endeavor is dorkiest buddy Fogell, who is the only one with a fake ID ... one that dubs him McLovin.  Okay, now that actually IS funny.  The rest ... not so much.  Hijinks ensue, but again, mostly a snoozer with excessively excessive foul language.  There are drug scenes, some nudity, yada yada ... stuff that seems to be written by a teenage boy for teenage boys.  How Judd Apatow has managed to become so successful is simply a mystery to me.  Having now seen three Apatow movies, I think I've finally learned my lesson.  The mere sight of Jonah Hill or Seth Rogen tells me BAD MOVIE.",N/A
282127,"Since the disasterous failure of Waterworld in the late 90s, Kevin Costner retreated to more modest projects.  Truth be told, I picked this up at the video store the other night and decided to give it a whirl.  It's ten years after Waterworld, and I was a bit disappointed to see that Kevin Costner's acting skills have not changed.  Still, this was a good movie.Kevin Costner is Mr. Brooks, a white collar Oregon businessman who seems to have everything - a successful business, wealth, a wonderful wife, etc.  He is hiding a dark secret, unknown to all.  He is a serial killer known locally as the Thumbprint Killer.  William Hurt is his alter ego, the little devil on his shoulder who is egging him on to give into his urges and invisable to all.  He's resisted temptation (in physical form of Hurt) for two years, but one night he gives into his urges and kills again.It's hard to read into this too deeply, because the story eventually becomes convoluted and a little too hoaky.  Demi Moore is the ambicious policewoman after him, dealing with her own personal issues (the cheating husband she is slugging it out in divorce court with, her boss, her father, etc.).  A man across the street from the house where Mr.Books murders a couple just happens to be taking pictures and attempts to blackmail Mr.Brooks into teaching him how to.  Mr.Brook's daughter returns from college, announcing that she is dropping out and clearly hiding something from her family.  Here Mr.Brooks attempts to play several roles.  He is the father trying to make everything alright for his daughter; but, I guess if your father is a serial killer and you as the child have inherited his need to kill, the only solution is to kill someone else at the college and lead the police investigation someplace else.  When Mr.Smith chooses someone to kill, you know who he chooses is going to somehow interlock with the rest of the story.  And the circumstances about Demi Moore's father issues are just a rip off of Clarice Starling (just like every movie with a female cop has been since).It is a good movie.  It makes some valid points about addiction and how people are willing to do anything and everything to satisfy their wants.  Still, it was a little too complicated and a little too hoaky to be considered very good.",Mr. Brooks
996327,"Voltron Volume 2 is a three-disc DVD set that includes fifteen episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series.  The first two discs contain six episodes, while the third disc contains three episodes and the special features.On this set, there are six items in the ""Special Features"" menu.  The first is labeled, ""Buckethead Music Video.""  This is a music video for ""Viva Voltron,"" a song recorded by Buckethead.  The video includes footage from Voltron, although some of the footage is obscured by superimposed appearances by Buckethead (and the footage of Buckethead has effects overlayed on it).  This is an interesting instrumental track, but I was rather underwhelmed by the video.The second feature is labeled as, ""The Life & Legend.""  This is a 34-minute documentary that talks about how grueling the production schedule for Voltron was, Marc Handler provides some background on the show and its appeal, information about a live event where actors dressed as some of the characters and toured the country, the Voltron Express charity event for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and a brief mention of the live-action film that was just in the works when the documentary was recorded.The next feature is labeled as, ""The Toys.""  In this nine-minute documentary, several people involved with Voltron talked about the toys and various merchandise tie-ins that Voltron had.The fourth feature is labeled as, ""T.V. Ads.""  This feature includes one English toy commercial, four or five Japanese toy commercials, and one commercial for the Lion Force Voltron television show.  When you view the ads, you have no way to select which ones you want to watch.  They all stream as one piece, in the upper corner of the screen (the rest of the screen is a border featuring Voltron toys).  Unfortunately, the quality of the audio and video on the commercials isn't the best.Another feature on the disc is labeled, ""International Voltron.""  This feature talks about how after World Events turned Beast King GoLion into Voltron, how other international markets became interested in Voltron, and would translate the Voltron version of the property into their native language.  The opening and closing of Beast King GoLion is included, as well as some shots and scenes of Voltron in English, French, and Spanish; also, the occasional scene from Beast King GoLion would be included.For fans of Voltron, this set allows you to obtain more episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series for your DVD collection.  Through the documentaries included on the third disc, you can also get some background information on what went on behind-the-scenes for the production of the Voltron series, as well as some background on the toys and merchandise.  This DVD set should really be in the collection of anyone who is a fan of Voltron.",Voltron - Defender of the Universe - Collection One: Blue Lion
1122209,"""The Half Blood Prince"" should be called ""The Half Cocked Film."" Books aside, the film leaps, jumps and bounces about from darkness to glee in artistic, engaging and dramatically potent form, but in the end may leave the viewer scratching their heads.Fans of the books KNOW what's going on, moviegoers may be a bit confused as the why things happen. For one, the film opens with Ginny and Harry madly in unspoken love as Ginny snogs Dean Thomas anyway, and Hermione is suddenly infatuated with Ron - sure, there has been tension between hem since puberty, but jealousy seems a bit of a stretch all of a sudden (in the books it's more of a slow brewing issue.)Without too many spoilers, ask yourself: how and why does Harry know what and for what use a Beazor is and why does his potions master (not Snape now) sit and watch a student die when the solution should be clear to him? Why is there no defenses at the Weasely house if they are in dire danger, why no Order members standing guard, no spells around the property and why do the Death Eaters attack? (hint, it's not in the book at all!!! so there's no answer.) Why does Dumbledore take Harry to the Burrow at the beginning of the film (it makes sense in the book, here, no reason.) Why does Harry take orders from Snape at the end without question? Why does no one challenge four Death Eaters running amok in Hogwarts and setting Hagrid's hut ablaze?The movie is fast, humorous, entertaining and a wonder to watch, both emotionally and visually. I buy the characters, the motivations, the special effects, everything almost... just not the logical flaws that made me scratch my head all the way home.I do hope they shot a lot of scenes that will someday make up an extended DVD /  Blu-Ray version. The film is so close to being the perfect Potter film, but forgets the audience isn't stupid.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1063292,"Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film with loads of five-star reviews on Amazon.  I choose to be the antidote to that.It's a great movie, especially in the characterization, acting and mood departments.  The plot starts out by asking me to accept a coincidence, then at the end rewards my faith by explaining it.So there's nothing wrong with it, except perhaps being a little bit slow-moving, but if you go in expecting it to live up to all the reviews -- I didn't because I hadn't seen the reviews -- you might be disappointed.I do think they should've found a way to film more of India.

870811,"I received my copy of Shark Tale for Christmas, last year, from one of my maternal aunts, and it became my most favorite computer-animated movie! I love this movie for lots of reasons: the all-star cast which includes Will Smith, Renee Zellweger, Martin Scorsese, Jack Black, Robert De Niro, etc., the way that the characters' faces look like the faces of the celebrities who supply the voices, as well as the plot, in which Oscar (Smith), who's a tongue scrubber at the local Whale Wash, tells a lie about killing a great white shark named Frankie, who's voiced by Michael Imperioli, of ""The Sopranos"", and the brother of Lenny (Black), and becomes the famous ""Sharkslayer"", and also that Lenny's a vegetarian, both of which make Lenny's ""Godfather""-type father, Don Lino (De Niro) furious. I also enjoy the really funny parts, such as when Oscar's boss, Sykes (Scorsese) puffs up & his voice rises in pitch, as well as Oscar & Lenny's pretend-fight in which it seems like Oscar's killing Lenny, just as Don Lino's gang of sharks & Lino's ""left-hand, right-hand"" man, who's an octopus, named Luca, voiced by Vincent Pastore, of ""The Sopranos"", arrives. What I'm really impressed with is the way that the creators & animators ""fishified"" the looks of the two worlds, especially the world where Oscar, his friend, Angie (Zellweger) and Sykes reside with the ""Swim, Don't Swim"" traffic signs, the orca police cars, the sperm whale buses and the great product tie-ins, such as ""Coral-Cola"" & ""Fish King"". I also like the soundtrack, but what I really like is that it teaches 2 good lessons: 1. You don't need fame & money to be a somebody"" and 2. You can love people just the way they are""!

659665,"This movie was really good. I didn't like the first batman but this one really made up for what the original was lacking. The biggest improvement was with the addition of the joker and the great job that Heath Ledger did playing the role. Even though I still think Jack Nicholson has a slight edge on him, Heath ledger put up a classic performance. The movie is well written, is packed with action and is enjoyable from beginning to end. I am a big comic fan so I love how the movie stayed true to the relationship between Batman /Joker, and how one can't do without the other in Gotham. Also being a chicago native, I thought it was great to see the many shots of Chi-town as batman fought with his villains.

1180498,"I'm one of the few people who really liked Ang Lee's version of the Hulk, so keep that in mind when I say this revamped version was, meh, OK. Where Lang's film had its heart and basis in the comic books, the new version staring Edward Norton has its heart in the 1970s TV series.The film has some major ""slow"" spots, But the 3 or four main action sequences that are in the film are wll done. And there's a truly wonderful sequence where Edward Norton (non-Hulk mode) does his best Matt Damon impression and has a Jason Bourne-esque chase sequence through the slums of Brazil.Norton does a great job portraying Bruce Banner's desperation, but Jennifer Connely is sorely missed as Banner's paramour. Tim Roth does a decent job as the film's main villain, Abomination as well. Fans are also introduced to two other key Hulk comic book characters throughout the course of the film (I won't mention names here lest I spoil the surprise for Hulk fans).However, I will say the film has a very intriguing end  shot of Edward Norton that shakes up a bit what the traditional Hulk mythos has been. Also there's a ""bonus"" scene a-la the Iron Man movie where Marvel Studios seems set to begin intertwining their film characters.",N/A
1113416,"After watching the season finale of season 6 with the introduction of Bizarro, I was excited believing the CW writers would step-up and transform Clark Kent from the not-so mild-mannered farm boy (that is more in tune with John Byrne's adaptation that Siegel and Shusters) into the caped Man of Steel that we've all been waiting for.  Instead, the writers went on strike.  When they came back, they put-together a mis-match bundle of episodes that made myself and other comic fans and scholars cringe.To myself and others, season six was the pinnacle of the series, especially with the ""Justice League"" episode where the team walks away from the ruble with serious expressions knowing their work has just begun.  THAT was awesome and, to me, it should have been where Clark Kent began to develop into the Man of Steel.  Instead, season seven went in complete reverse and brought the franchise back to it's roots; teen drama.  Granted that is what the WB (Now CW) is known for but the original four seasons were to show Clark Kent's high school years; when that theme ran it's course the producers decided to explore the early transformation of Clark Kent into the Man of Steel but that theme has gone on and on... and on for about three seasons and now season seven retrogresses back into teen drama once again.The teen-drama begins with Kara (AKA Supergirl), Clark's cousin from Krypton.  Now, Supergirl was introduced in the 1950s to entice younger readers with what historian Bradford Wright calls ""silly stories.""  In this regard, the CW sticks true to the comics as Kara's stories right from the start are exactly that starting with a Miss Smallville beauty contest.  The distrust and arguments from Clark to Kara are somewhat true to the comics although their back and forth badgering spanning several episodes got annoying and her character development seemed to be more on her revealing outfits.  It's obvious they didn't hire Laura Vandervort (Kara) for her good acting or bright ideas.  Then again, with the exception of Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor), the same can be said of the entire cast.The next element of annoying teen drama was the back-and-forth love story of Clark and Lana Lang.  Now, anyone remotely familiar with the Superman mythos knows Superman is destined to be with Lois Lane and Lana was more of a childhood crush to help with the back story rather than be a recurring character.  For the sake of the first four Smallville seasons, this meant Lana had to stay and rightfully so.  Problem is, even with Clark Kent ""maturing"" after his graduation from high school, Lana wouldn't leave, the drama intensified, and she actually became a detested character.  Lana's constant trust then mistrust of Clark was more akin to a bad soap opera than intriguing drama.  Thank GOD she's gone!On top of that, without Clark Kent even dreaming of becoming the Man of Steel, he has fought several primary villains from the Superman franchise such as General Zod (which was poorly done), Brainiac, and Bizarro.  Now I hear Clark Kent, not Superman, will face Doomsday in season 7 the villain that ""killed"" Superman in 1993.To compensate for a lack of Superman development, the writers decided to use some creative liberties and introduced a group called ""Veritas,"" a secret society that knows a ""secret"" on how to control ""the traveler"" AKA Clark Kent.  Now, I loved that they brought Robert Picardo (known as The Doctor on Star Trek: Voyager) as a guest star on an episode or two, but the Veritas conspiracy essentially seemed more of the same trust/mistrust style story that just had a Latin name.To me, however, the largest complaints of the series is the horrible insertions of commercial advertisements into the show.  The episode ""Hero"" was nothing but a 42-minute long advertisement for Stride Gum under the guise of bringing back the 'beloved' character Pete Ross.  Ross even goes as far as to hold up a container of Stride Gum with a smile on his face.  Last time I saw something that blatant was a parody of advertising in Wayne's World.  The show also inserted numerous Toyota references, especially to the Yaris.  Granted in one episode in season six Chloe gives Clark her keys and says, ""Take the Yaris,"" not realizing the head space in one of those cars would not be sufficient to allow actor Thomas Welling (who is easily over six feet tall) to drive comfortably.  Believe me, I've sat in one and I'm 6'5.Now, despite all my criticisms I do have some compliments on season seven and these pluses will push me to purchase the series!The episode ""Apocalypse"" where Clark witnesses a world without him, while being an obvious rip-off of It's a Wonderful Life, has an interesting yet subtle message embedded into it.  It shows Clark Kent trying to blend in by being bumbly, wearing a traditional dark suit with thick glasses, and showing affection for Lois.  To me, this shows what Smallville would look like if they went from what they are to what many critics are demanding they become and I gotta tell ya, aside from the nuclear missiles I liked what I saw.  This was Thomas Welling's debut as a director and I thought he did an excellent job portraying himself as what Clark Kent SHOULD be.  I think the CW writers should move towards this mindset minus the nuclear Armageddon.The next episode I really liked was ""Action"" where an action film purposefully made to look like the Superman franchise is being filmed in Smallville.  This episode was made in response to various fans, such as myself, criticizing Lana Lang's character as antiquated and unnecessary demanding that she be booted off the show.  While this episode makes a strong reference to the disaster on the set of The Crow, it still takes an almost humorous jab at it's critics, so kudos to the writers for that episode.After all is said and done, I can barely recommend this season to Smallville fans; it retrogresses back to teen drama and bores the audience with back and forth drama that resembles a cheesy soap opera than a comic-based show.  However, it does have some quality points that fairly redeem it in my eyes and I hope the writers, now back from the strike, will shape up or ship out as I will watch season eight with a heightened sense of scrutiny.",N/A
231913,"Who would have thought that the gal who played the ultimate cheesecake role as outer space babe, Barbarella, a few years earlier would be capable of such a magnificent performance as her in the role of alienated prostitute Bree in Klute?

Visually and compositionally ""smart"" and sensible, and interesting, never over the top, never draws attention to itself stylistically. Noir-like in its use of natural lighting and locations.  Subdued but effective musical score. No, this film isn't a, ""... it was Colonel Mustard in the library with the rope"" whodunit. You know, pretty much, who the killer is fairly early on.  It's an excellent, well-written, impeccably photographed and directed character study with some potent performances.

1228009,"Australia is the followup to Moulin Rouge but bigger antecedecents lie behind it, Gone with the Wind, Titanic, Doctor Zhivago, Reds, big pictures told on a national scale.  In fact I wonder what Australians make of Australia, which seems to involve just one patch of the continent (the Northern Territory), when you would think it would be possible to involve all the Australian states?  Anyhow the story is pretty vast as is, and basically it's held together by a pretty tough racialized storyline involving the ""stolen generations,"" aboriginal children claimed by the state and brought up in orphanages away from their families.The story is told largely from the point of view of Nullah, son of an Aboriginal mother and a white dad, and therefore left feeling that he belongs nowhere.  Watched over from afar by his grandfather, little Nullah has a vague, pagan sense of cause and effect; for an American speaker his imagery of singing and fate and a violent liberty seems intoxicatingly difficult and offkilter, and maybe this soupcon of the unknown (even the ""exotic"" if you will) gives the otherwise stock romantic plot between Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman a new dimension.  After all, one can no longer believe that the romantic trials of a drover and an aristocratic Mrs. Boss should take central stage when so much else is going on in the world--so much injustice and so much bigoted cruelty.Kidman's character arc as Lady Sarah Ashley is like something out of an 80s'Goldie Hawn movie--pampered princess learns about life as it's lived in the dirt--but I suppose it was Scarlett O'Hara's too, tearing into the earth for a single turnip and swearing never to go hungry again.  Meanwhile a parade of Australia's top actors, including Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown, David Wenham, and even David Gulpilil (from Walkabout, The Last Wave, Rabbit-Proof Fence and Crocodile Dundee) take minor and major roles, so the movie also has some of the fun factor of George Stevens' Greatest Story Ever Told, with John Wayne as the Centurion.  There isn't one thing about Australia I didn't love--except for the horrid Elton John song that plays over the final credits.  Why, Baz, why, was this some secret gay tradeoff?  Outside of that gaffe, I spent the last hour and a half of the movie in tears, it was like the heavens opened and rained on my face, and I can barely remember a time when I did not live in Darwin and squadrons of highly trained Japanese pilots were not pouring down colorful bombs and destroying every evil person in town and breaking the prisons wide open.There weren't too many people in the theater when I saw Australia and I hope this isn't a sign of the movie not doing well.  It has had some totally unfair reviews.  Then I recall that the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth times I saw Moulin Rouge the theater wasn't all that packed either.Those reviews made me think, going in, that I wouldn't be enjoying the film, and I can report that this was not the case.  It was fantastic and beautiful and wonderfully done.  OK, it's not for everyone.  But for me, it was the movie of the year and I only wish that Elton had just said, no thanks Baz Luhrmann.",N/A

My favorite character was Grigg, probably because I so rarely see this character in movies; he played the part of one of those great guys that we meet, know we should marry, but don't because there isn't any chemistry; well, his character is that guy with the chemistry; kudos to actor Hugh Dancy for being able to pull off this role.All of the cast gave wonderful performances that pulled me in.

The two stars gave phenomenal performances, and the movie even through in its fair share of teeth gritting gore and wince-worthy moments.

658796,"""Cloverfield"" is not only much better than I was expecting, it is, in fact, an extremely clever, well-executed, and scary movie. Kudos to the team that produced this film, as it could have gone wrong in so many ways.Without providing spoilers, I will describe the premise of ""Cloverfield"" as follows: what if a monster movie were real? Now, that may seem like a trivial premise, because any work of fiction attempts to create a sense of reality. But think about it: there are fictional movies about ""real stuff"" (i.e. Howard's End, The Right Stuff, To Kill a Mockingbird, etc.) and there are fictional movies about ""not-real stuff"" (i.e. Godzilla, Star Wars, Fahrenheit 911, etc.) Well, what if there were a monster in a ""real stuff"" movie? The effect would be, and is, quite unsettling, and this is what ""Cloverfield"" attempts, through the device of an unedited home movie that presents, in large part, the mundane material of which most such movies are made.For this reason, ""Cloverfield"" reminds me a bit of Shyamalan's ""Signs"", which I felt attempted to do the very same thing (and which was also very effective). It also reminded me of Stephen King's ""The Mist"" (the novella, not the movies) mostly due to the nightmarish collision of unreality and reality that both share.One thing that impressed me is that the device used in the film could have easily become contrived or gimmicky if not handled with extreme finesse; everything was spot on. I found myself grinning as the film really got going, enjoying what the filmmakers were doing. The grinning soon went away, as the movie is actually pretty scary.""Cloverfield"" leaves you wanting more, and with many questions unanswered. (Although, as with other J.J. Abrams works, some answers are there if you look closely enough...) If you love scary movies, and are not a TOTAL BABY about shaky, hand-held camera footage, you will love ""Cloverfield!""",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
1113505,"Questar released Season Five of this landmark series with chopped up syndicated episodes and even the syndicated opening credits.  It was awful.My hope is that S'More is giving us the complete episodes with the original titles!If so, my five star review will stand.Folks, I got the set today - the review stands.  This is a terrific set.  It is more than expected and leaves a lot of other TV series collections in the dust.  At last this series, which was the bridge between ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" is available as it should be seen for those who loved it then - and for those who will discover it anew.The sad Season Five had edited syndication versions of the show with the syndication titles. This set has the original titles at the beginning of each episode and the episodes are full length.  If you were disappointed in Season Five, don't let that keep you from buying Season Six.  It's a whole new ball game.All of the characters are here along with some stunning guest stars:  Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Dinah Shore, William Demarest, and in a continuing arc, Miss Annette Funicello who also sings and dances.  The episodes look better than they did way back when.  The sound is as crisp and clear as the images.The extras include interviews with Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, and Sid Melton.  They all talk candidly and with a lot of affection for the show, their work, and the star Danny Thomas.  It's great seeing Marjorie and Angela and hearing about their lives after the show.  One extra also has Marjorie (mother of actress Anne Archer) reading from her book ""A Dance and A Hug.""There is a PSA for St. Jude Hospital that opens each DVD, and another PSAis a short extra on one disk.  There is also a ""blooper"" reel that gives you a great backstage feel for how the show was put together.  Annette is featured in a couple of the clips, and Angela Cartwright and a hula hoop figure prominently in another.Easy to navigate - you will enjoy all 32 episodes of ""The Danny Thomas Show"" - aka ""Make Room for Daddy.""  Danny Thomas was a unique performer who could sing, dance, do comedy, and also deliver a serious line when he wanted to.  His mannerisms - sometimes hilariously mimicked by Marjorie, Angela, and Rusty Hamer - are still funny.  The show entertains on a couple of levels:  as a sitcom and as a variety show.Thanks to S'More Entertainment for getting it right.  Buy it.  Tell them Uncle Tanoose sent you.",Make Room for Daddy: Season 6
473581,"""Seven Chances"" (1925) is a fine example of Buster Keaton placing his stylistic imprint on material not specifically tailored for him. In fact, the premise appears ideal for Harold Lloyd: a stockbroker belatedly discovers he will inherit $7 million if he marries by 7 p.m. that evening, yet only has a few hours remaining. What could have been a traditional thrill comedy emerges as a surreal nightmare - featuring one of the great climaxes in movie history, with hundreds of potential brides (and an avalanche of boulders) chasing Buster through the Southern California landscape. The 20-minute sequence is propelled by Keaton's stunning athleticism and a remarkable editing precision. Like many Keaton silents, ""Seven Chances"" seamlessly fuses his deadpan expressiveness with an expert command of the film medium. He transforms a simple farce into a provocative examination of ruthless romance in which deadly boulders are preferable to devouring women.",Seven Chances / Neighbors / The Balloonatic

That being said, I would say I enjoyed the directors commentary of Halloween 5 because it gave the director a chance to defend his choices of why he did what he did. I think it's much better than sitting through the whole movie wondering ""why did they do something stupid like that"". I dont agree with most of his choices but at least I understand his mind set a little better.

339378,"This film turned out much better than I had expected.  It is not one you hear mentioned everyday, but it has it's place here around my hometown in Western N.C.  It is here that some of the film was shot on location, specificaly the breathtaking climactic fight on the rock face mountain (shot at Chimney Rock park, just outside of Asheville.)  The scene, which is my original means for seeing this movie, was shot better than I could have imagined, and I have been to the park on numerous occasions.  The music, the charcaters, the story - it all came together in this climactic finish.  But enough about that, the entire film turned out to be astonishing and I enjoyed nearly every moment of it.The cinematography of the lush forests, pouring waterfalls, and glazing mountain ranges are almost guranteed to draw you into this epic, along with an incredible score that screams epic and beauty, which is so good it's worth buying on cd.  The story is well told and holds a good deal of interest, with points of view told from multiple angles - the English, French, Indians, and the Mohicans - 3 men, playing our main characters who remain neutral to the surrounding conflicts.  One is an Indian father, the other two his sons, one Indian and the other an adopted white - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis)  The story of these men is wondeful, showing us it is possible to stay neutral for only so long surrounded by such events.  Hawkeye falls in love with an English colonel's daughter, and from there on it gets complicated, though rewarding with love and romance.Speaking of romance, this is what the film comes down to.  In the end its really about love, and that sounds cheesy, but this is one of those films that take it so far without ever getting cheesy.  It is one of the best romance films I have seen.  The kiss shared between Hawkeye and Cora isn't your typical hollywood kiss scene.  Something about it shouts passion and love in the most realistic of senses.  And then there is the other love in the film, a shared and secretive love that had an astounding conclusion in the end - both wonderful yet immensly sad and tragic.  I don't want to say who these two were, because it is worth the watch to see this unfold.If you are an action junkie, this isn't really so much the movie for you, but be pleased to know that there is plenty of action throughout.  It may not hold up to scenes in films like Braveheart or The Patriot, but some of the action taking place admidst the beautiful landscapes give it that additional boost to standapart from the other films.  And like most films, there's always a villain, and Wes Studi portray's Magua very well, eventually doing as he said he would, ripping the heart out of the English colonel.Though this film will never compare to the perfection and grandness of say Dances With Wolves, this holds its own and has unique qualities that certainly sets itself apart.  Very underrated and not spoken of enough, this movie is one to be added to everyone's must see list.Acting - 4.5Action - 4Characters - 4.5Story - 4.5Overall - 4.5",N/A

1145050,"Totally awesome show. I don't own the dvd and will explain why shortly. However I have seen every episode aired so far in japan via fansubs online. This show starts out good and stays good throughout.Now is the problem part. This show is almost 400 episodes long so far in japan and shows no signs of slowing down at all. Then Funimation releases this set. I am very happy as many people are that they made these dvds uncut finally, unlike the 4kids version garbage. However this box holds 13 episodes....anyone want to do the math on how many boxes will be required to hold just the current ~400 episodes? Its 30 boxes. for the first 400 episodes, plus at least 100 more episodes probably or more.What I ask for and want, is much larger box sets, use a slim form factor of some kind or other and release box sets with like 50 episodes if possible. Then I would have to buy far fewer boxes and it would take up less shelf space. I know this is mostly just semantics and personal preference, but I'm not the only one who feels this way and for a show this insanely long, more expansive box sets are necessary. Asking for this concession seems more than reasonable to me, if not an outright obvious thing to do.Lastly, How many shows do you know that run 400 episodes plus and stay good the whole time? I know of no other. So if you don't mind the size of this box or have no intention of buying more than the first few seasons, then this box is very worth your while. So go and buy it already. Those of us who plan to buy all 560 episodes of the show or however many it ends up being....all we can do is pray they will wise up and give bigger boxes. Good luck to everyone?

1088533,"I rented this DVD with the quite reasonable expectation that it was a horror genre flick involving insects, along the lines of 'Mimic' or 'Seven'.  After all, it said as much on the box, and was directed by William Friedkin, who brought us 'The Exorcist'.  Be advised that if that kind of movie is what you want to watch, you need to rent or buy something else. Based on a stage play of the same name, 'Bug' takes place almost exclusively in a small and grotty motel room and the even smaller, grottier spaces of the protaganists' minds.  I guess we could call it 'psychological terror', though that seems rather generous.  There are NO bugs in this film except the imaginary ones that exist in a tortured and schizophrenic mind.  Once that is understood, you will be in a position to better evaluate this movie on its merits, such as they are.  Ashley Judd is a luminously talented actress whose role choices tend to skew toward damaged, trashy characters, and I think these same 'victim' roles only serve to keep her talent underrated.  However, Judd mines some really dark places and is willing to go to hell, quite literally, for this material, and her committed, brave performance is one of the few things to recommend this movie.  Harry Connick appears in a brief supporting role as Judd's ex-con ex-husband and steals all of the few scenes he's in.  Judd's character, Aggie, is grieving the abduction loss of her young son, and though this thread is never satisfactorily explored, it does provide an explanation for the emotional vulnerability that leads to her descent into mutual paranoia.  It might have been a cheaper resolution to actually provide the audience with some real bugs, but at least that would have fulfilled our expectations.",N/A

47981,"THE MOVIE:  Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" is superb.  It is also majestic, romantic, thrilling, adventurous, frightening, funny, dramatic, heartbreaking, heartwarming, heroic, and just plain wonderful.Every single actor in the film delivers a phenomenal performance (although Chris Ellis as Deke Slayton isn't given much to work with by the script), and Howard's direction is the best it could possibly be.  I need hardly rehash the information in other reviews about the absolutely authentic recreation of the historical visual elements of the movie, or the use of NASA's KC-135 ""Vomit Comet"" to film most of the scenes set in weightlessness.Some may prefer ""The Right Stuff"" to ""Apollo 13"" as a movie because it's more imaginative, but ""Apollo 13"" is one of the most accurate and faithful docudramas ever made about space exploration.THE DVD:  ""Apollo 13"" has not one but two of the best DVD commentary tracks I have ever heard.  Ron Howard's account of the making of the movie is full of fascinating anecdotes, but even better is the commentary by Jim and Marilyn Lovell, which is simply one of the coolest bonus features ever found on a Digital Video Disc.The Lovells' commentary is the equivalent of hearing Scarlett and Rhett comment on ""Gone With The Wind"", or Frodo and Sam (as distinct from Wood and Astin) discuss Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"".  Because the movie is so faithful to the historical record, Lovell is able to describe his own inner thoughts and feelings over big closeups of Tom Hanks (e.g., when he's watching Neil Armstrong step onto the moon).Among the other special features on the second disc is the condensed IMAX version of the movie, which is in a different aspect ratio (one which fills the whole screen of a widescreen TV, whereas the unedited movie fills the entire width of the screen but has black bars at the top and bottom).  This version is mainly interesting as a demonstration of how an Academy Award-winning director goes about trimming one of his masterpieces.

The show survived this by brining in Paul Playdon as lead writer and Stanley Kallis as Producer.  Season Four began with even more potentially damaging changes as Martin Landau and Barbara Bain also abruptly left the show.  To replace Landau's ""Rollin Hand"" character who wore masks and impersonated other people, Leonard Nimoy was brought in as ""Paris"" (we never learn his first name). Nimoy is not the actor Landau is, and he complained later that he was not given enough challenging roles, but he was adequate.  His best performances were in the episodes ""Gitano"" and ""The Code"" which otherwise were not among the best stories.  Later in the season, lead writer Paul Playdon left the show due to exhaustion, along with Producer Stanley Kallis.  In spite of this, the show continued to make fine entertaining episodes, in spite of the fact that no single leading lady actress was brought in to replace Barbara Bain's ""Cinnamon Carter"" character.In two especially good episodes, ""The Crane"" and ""The Submarine"", the IM Force has to race the clock as intensive police cordons are zeroing in on them while they have to deceive a leader of a police state or break an ""unbreakable"" prisoner.

John Van Eyssen's Jonathan Harker is no longer a lawyer, but here is posing as a librarian to get into Dracula's castle with an ulterior motive - presumably on the grounds that the audience knows going in just what Dracula is so there's no point putting the hero through all that mystery when there's staking to be done. The budget doesn't stretch to the voyage and arrival of the ghost ship Demeter or even a Renfield for that matter, and this Dracula has no social interaction with his intended victims in Whitby or London - in fact, he never even leaves the continent. Nor is the vampire fascinated with Harker's intended - here he simply seeks her out as revenge. Yet the changes work surprisingly well, and even throws in a few good twists like the location of Dracula's hiding place.Although he doesn't have much screen time, Christopher Lee is inspired casting, a feral, vicious creature rather than a Eurotrash smoothie while a very agile Peter Cushing makes a surprisingly physical Van Helsing, the final fight between the good doctor and the evil count surprisingly energetic and violent before the best of the studio's ashes to ashes, dust-to-dust finales. Although rather sedate by today's standards, this film still has a surprising degree of energy and it's easy to see why it made had such a profound impact on the horror genre for decades to come. The first colour version of the tale, it made a big selling point of being able to see the blood in all its vivid hues of red, although it also makes much play on the vampire's female victims being absolutely gagging for it (perhaps not so surprising with Peter Cushing and Michael Gough as the male leads), setting the groundwork for the tits'n'fangs formula that would become the studio's bread and butter over the next couple of decades. A surprisingly cheap picture, thanks to Bernard Robinson's elegant production design and fine direction from Terence Fisher before the drink got to him, it never looks cheap: if anything, it's rather seductively good looking. Unfortunately this is slightly compromised by Warners' widescreen DVD, which feels overcropped at 1.85:1 (the film was intended to be shown in 1.66:1) and there's also a slight wobble at the end of the closing credits.",N/A
1018518,"I loved...how this video was in her home with the same amount of space I had to work with, she was wearing normal workout clothes and no makeup (not all pretend like so many videos), it was just her and not 6 people on a stage, she didn't have loud and outdated music in the background, how we didn't do the grapevine and other stupid dances the whole time, it was just plain variations of squats & lunges. If I made a workout video this is exactly how  I'd do it.Every week I walk & use elliptical twice and do yoga and I felt this video to be a very good workout. I couldn't keep up the first time around (8 months pregnant), but love that it will challenge me the next few weeks until the labor. It is great preparation with all the squatting too.

1039553,"This TV film revolves around the somewhat unwilling reunion of a female musical group that was a teen sensation. It's most famous hit song was ""My Boyfriend's Back""--the title of the film. The film stars Jill Eikenberry of LA Law fame, Sandy Duncan of TV's Hogan Family, and Judith Light--who skyrocketed to fame as closeted prostitute & doctor's wife, Karen Wolek, on the ABC Daytime Drama One Life To Live in the late 70s-mid 80s, and then, found primetime sitcom icon status with ABC's Who's The Boss? and now Ugly Betty. I originally watched this film debut on TV and had enjoyed it very much. When I saw it again on Amazon, I was hit by a wave of nostalgia. It was even better in some respects than I  remembered. I have to say that the major draw for me at the time & still is Judith Light. I have been a fan since her phenomenal days on OLTL and then on WTB. I am so thrilled she is back on primetime again with Ugly Betty.The film touches on some great dramatic issues and all three ladies have great comedic timing. And, it's a chance to hear all three sing, which is worth the time.",N/A
740787,"I really did not know what to expect when I sat down to watch Hellboy.  While there have been some excellent movies based on comic books, I had never even heard of Hellboy until recently, and did not have high hope.  But the trailer for Hellboy 2 was so entertaining, that I figured I needed to give Hellboy a try.What a surprise!  Hellboy is a light-hearted action-horror film (there's a new genre for you!).  It is filled with action and suspense, yet it is also filled with comedy and charm.  This movie does not try to take itself too seriously.  My guess is that it comes pretty close to the comic books, and does not try to be ""more"".Ron Perlman truly shines as Hellboy, bright red skin, horns, and all. The tender scenes between Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) (fire-starter and love interest) are sweet and funny.  Doug Evans is very engaging as Abe Sapien, Hellboy's friend and partner. John Hurt is excellent as Hellboy's ""father.""  Another standout is Jeffery Tambor as Hellboy's boss. He is a real jerk throughout most of the film, and you just plain don't like him.  But near the end, the ""Thank You"" scene between these two actors is dead-pan perfection.Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie about good verses evil, where the (unlikely) superhero makes a difficult choice, and still gets the girl in the end.  As I said before, I had no idea what to expect, and wasn't even sure that I would like it.  But, there is something quite appealing and charming about this film; it almost sneaks up on you.  I highly recommend that you give it a try.",N/A

Jim Hawkins, while polite, is incredibly resilient and thinks very fast on his feet. And Long John Silver is not some evil minion, but a man of honor who believes in democracy, no less!My hats off to the filmmakers for having the courage to re-interpret a classic in such a dramatic fashion.

1100997,"This is one amazing DVD and I am sure many people have never even heard of Private First Class Desmond Doss, U S Army Medical Detachment of the 307th Infantry and then 77th Infantry Division.  And as the subtitle notes: The story of bravery, loyality and faith.I sat spell bound listening to those who served with him, and hearing how so many men in the service mocked him, demeaned him, and tried to get him to give up his Christian faith, even when they knew he didn't have to serve as a medic because of his religious beliefs but wanted to in order to serve others. And he was nothing short of miraculous and unselfish even when he was badly wounded and was being carried to safety and saw another soldier badly hurt, and Doss rolled off the stretcher and went to help the man and asked that they take him to get further help first.And 400 feet up a cliff area he went, and over twelve hours with the rope set up he devised, he lowered one by one, injured men, at the rate of roughly one every 10-15 minutes. This was while he and his unit were in Urasoe Mura, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, April-May 1945. What was so interesting was an Army guy named Cunningham who was in charge of him and ridiculed him and basically called him a coward, ran away when the Japanese were attacking, according to numerous men who served in the same unit and saw the guy run or basically desert.But not once did Doss flinch in any job he was given even when Cunningham and other officers gave him KP duty where his hands were raw from all the cleaning. Or when on Sunday he was made to clean bathrooms.  And he always rested on the sabbath and always had his Bible with him.Some members of his unit even said after he prayed for them, their unit was the only one that didnt loose on man. As the movie shows, those who didnt understand him or disagreed with him at the time, saw a real man once they saw him in action.",N/A

1104204,"On a lovely day in Hampstead Heath, seven couples explore their relationships, find love, break up, and come to a crossroads. Most of the seven stories are not intertwined, except for a few parting glances here or there, and one man who is desperately looking to couple up with a woman for the day.The good: I loved the story between Pete and Sara, who I thought were a lovely as husband and wife, and then realized that they were there to share the joint custody of their child, each clutching their divorce papers in hand. It appears that they still love each other, but something is not...right.I also enjoyed the scenes between Brian and Billy (played by Ewan McGregor) a couple who are grappling with the decision to adopt a child, when Billy is having a hard time growing up.Ludo and Esther also gave good performances. If I hadn't read the blurb on the back of the DVD cover, I would have thought that this duo had been together for years and very happy, but this one had a little shock and surprise at the end.The bad: Eddie and Iris's story had captured me at first. Two old friends meeting 40-50 years later, on the same bench they frequented when they were 17, as they were once in love. Something lost me in the middle when it could have been very romantic.Molly and Jamie were featured in the first story, a happily married unit, whose relaxing day is ruined when Jamie spends a little too much time staring a French girl, whose underwear is showing. He then makes up this convoluted story about how he once read the same book she's reading and tells his wife what it's about, etc. She then sees through the falsehood, then goes to the French girl to catch her husband in a lie. I guess it could have been a good story, but something felt a little too contrived about it.The story with Julia and Gerry starts out well as a couple on a clumsy and awkward blind date. As they misunderstand each other less, and start to like each other more, one silly glance at someone else, sends the other into a flurry. It just didn't seem finished and it was a little too abrupt.The strange: Anna and Noel meet after she's had a fight with her boyfriend, and they break up. What occurs then is a back and forth conversation about what is going to happen next. One of them seems crazy, and the other desperate.As in many movies or books that have several different stories with many characters, you can't always expect to connect with all of them. Unfortunately, the number that I connected with was smaller than those that I did. This would be a good film to watch if you do not need a lot of action, but want to be reminded of the interconnectedness of people, and view all of their idiosyncracies. Also, you can never go wrong with London.",N/A

1152587,"This used to be one of my all time favourite tv shows and I can't wait to see it again.  Jake Styles was so 'smooth' as an investigator working for J.L McCabe who was the District Attorney.  The show started off in LA and later down the track it moves to Hawaii.McCabe was a cigar smoking 'tough' guy who had his dog follow him everywhere (or sit still and do nothing) and Jake was a 'suave' (back then) guy who almost always got the girl.  Each episode was usually a new story and by todays standards, it's very old school but to me, that is some of the appeal.  I loved the chemistry between McCabe and Jake - almost like a father and son relationship.  There was also Derek Mitchell who always tried his best to impress McCabe, but never seemed to do so.  He was a little goofy, especially in Jake's shadow.It's definately worth checking out.  It's much better than Riptide which Joe Penny (Jake) also starred in.  I recommend it if you like the old style of getting the bad guys.",N/A
1038154,"I'll be honest in that I didn't have the chance to see World Class until I got WWE 24/7 a year ago as it wasn't available to me growing up but this is WWE's 4th attempt at telling the story behind another wrestling promotion.  This can either go the way of the ""Rise & Fall Of ECW"" where they go a great job in telling the buildup & downfall of the company along with the legacy it left behind that's still used in wrestling today or the way of the AWA or WCW on the Monday Night Wars DVD where they quickly gloss over the positive influence of the company before spending a majority of time picking apart the negatives of the company from a heavily biased WWE point of view just to put over it's superiority.  Well, I saw this as the ECW route in which WWE did justice to a wrestling company that even I knew changed the way wrestling was presented that still effects us today.The documentry kicks off by talking about the early days of Texas wrestling with comments from Texas legends such as Dusty Rhodes & Dory Funk Jr.  The beginning of Fritz Von Erich, his reputation, and how he moved into becoming a promoter & wrestler is talked about.  The documentry moves on in how the Von Erich boys (David, Kerry, Kevin) came into wrestling along, Fritz retiring as a wrestler leading to a big show at a football stadium in Texas, the backlash towards the kids being pushed in the promotion, and just how over the Von Erich's were over in Texas.  How the TV show expanded into sydication across america & international countries was talked about including how the boys wanted to travel but Fritz didn't want to break the traditional ""territorial"" rules.  All the new elements the promotion brought to wrestling such as personality profiles & features were glossed upon with a funny story about what happened at a water park.  The legacy of the Sportatorium was brought up next before moving onto how the Freebirds came into World Class & what elements they brought to the show in & outside the ring was talked about before moving onto how the big rivarly between them & the Von Erichs got started in the cage match with Kerry & Ric Flair.  The story behind Gary Hart leaving that night & Ken Mantel taking over the booking along with the influx of young stars coming into the company such as Wild Bill Irwin, Iceman Parsons, Jimmy Garvin with Sunshine & eventually his wife Precious, Chris Adams, Kamala, The Missing Link, and Brusier Brody is heavily discussed.  How the Freebirds feuds with the Von Erich's rivarly brought in bigger crowds along with the importance of each member of the group is discussed before moving onto all the events leading up to David's death in Japan along with the aftermath which lead to WCCW's biggest crowd.  The memoral show is discussed with highlights of Fritz coming out of retirement against the Freebirds along with Kerry winning the NWA Champion before revealing why Kerry didn't have a long reign as champion.  Gary Hart's return along with his influence in the Chris Adams heel turn & feud with Kevin was brought up including the ""stiff"" working styles both men had with each other.  The story behind Mike Von Erich's toxic shock syndrome was talked about before going into the negative effect that ""Lance Von Erich"" had on the company (I guess he was the Paul Roma of the group).  The story of Gino Hernandez in how over he was as a heel and various storylines he was in was talked about before moving on to his death via cocane & how much it effected Gary Hart up to that time (he's passed away since this DVD was released).  World Class withdrawing from the NWA & making their own champions was brought up in a negative light with comments from Gary Hart & Kevin in how that was a bad decision despite having wrestlers like Rick Rude & Chris Adams as champion.  The story behind Kerry's motorcycle accident & losing his foot is talked about next before talking about the influence of drugs into the company.  The events leading up to the suicide of Mike Von Erich is next and such a sad story told by Gary Hart before moving on to the heart attack angle they did with Fritz Von Erich.  The SuperClash III PPV with the unification match between AWA Champion Jerry Lawler & WCCW Champion Kerry Von Erich is talked about next with how various parts of match was booked due to certain events before moving on to how WCCW was turned into the USWA.  Kerry moving on to the WWF as the Texas Tornado & winning the Intercontinental Championship was highlighted before Kevin went into why he wanted to leave the business & the suicides of both Chris & Kerry Von Erich with footage from the ""Current Affair"" television show regarding Kerry's death close out the documentry.This DVD comes with 12 bonus matches featuring a 2 out of 3 Falls match with Duke Keomuka vs. Ricky Starr, Fritz' retirement match against King Kong Bundy, the steel cage match between NWA Champion Ric Flair & Kerry Von Erich that started the feud with the Freebirds, Fritz coming out of retirement with Mike & Kevin against the Freebirds, Chris Adams & Sunshine vs. Jimmy Garvin & Precious, Great Kabuki vs. Kamala, Fantastics vs. Midnight Express, Bruiser Brody & The Missing Link vs. One Man Gang & Rick Rude, Bruiser Brody vs. Abdullah the Butcher in a steel cage match, and a Hair match between Iceman Parsons vs. Buddy Roberts.  Kevin Von Erich does alternative commentary with Todd Grisham on two matches with him vs. Chris Adams and with Kevin & Iceman vs. Freebirds.The only negatives I have here is that eventhough as I said that I didn't watch WCCW until around a year ago, I know that more could have been said about King Kong Bundy & Destivation Inc. since even I heard about them when I was young but yet they didn't get anything past a quick one liner throughout this documentry & they would have gotten some words from Steve Austin since he's said it time & time again that he grew up watching WCCW & would drive down every Friday night to see the Von Erich/Freebird feud so his memories as a fan would have been great to hear.  In the end, this DVD reminded me exactly of Jake Roberts' in that when they bring up fun & memorable angles then it's a fun documentry to watch & get a couple of laughts off the stories being told but when they talk about the dark times, it's one that's either really distrubing or really sad to watch.  After watching this, you can see why WWE decided to push this documentry back for months after the Benoit incident last July & Triple H described the sad deaths throughout this promotion best...""A public service announcement saying DON'T DO DRUGS!""  This isn't just a documenty I recommend as a wrestling fan but one I would recommend for parents to show their children as well who are wrestling fans when teaching them the dangers of heavy drug use & the effects negative effects of suicide.",The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Championship Wrestling
1198100,"I've seen the theatrical version of this film twice.  Once when it was in first run, and again now on Blu-ray.  To be blunt, I thought the film was ok when it was in first run, but wasn't impressed enough with it to want to see it again.  It was and is ok in my book, but I felt it lacked somewhat, at least when compared to my memories of the original TV series.Ah, the TV series.  Total camp, but fun at the same time.  Loved by enough viewers that I can see why it would seem to be a target to mine on the bigger screen, especially with someone like Steve Carell in the lead. Carell makes a good Maxwell Smart, and if the story were better, I think this one could have been a genuine 5 star hit.  Unfortunately, as others have said here, it missed it by that much :-(Anne Hathaway is ok in taking over the Barbara Feldon role, and Alan Arkin isn't bad as the chief.  Honestly none of the performances are disappointing to me, it's just that the story itself, at least from the theatrical version isn't as funny as it should be.Which brings me back to the 62% more laughs that are promised in the Blu-ray.  Ah, more laughs from promised bonus scenes actually sounds good and enticed me to give the Blu-ray a try, but ... the presentation is just so disappointing to me that I have got to slam it in this review.Offering up a director's cut or extended cut version of a film is something that I greatly appreciate, but if you are going to do it, by all that is right in the universe please do it in a way that respects the viewer and not as done here.Seamless branching has been around in the DVD format for a while and it's used here, but isn't even close to being seamless.  Far from it, it seems that if you turn on the bonus scene viewing version of the film you get a neat little icon of Maxwell Smart in the phone booth (or at least of the phone booth) to indicate that bonus materials are now being shown.  That's not bad but... the icon is much larger than it needs to be and obliterates part of the screen when it needn't have been so intrustive.  Even looking past that there's a greater annoyance -- when the bonus scenes are accessed there's an annoying pause present, at least when played on my PS3.  Just enough of a pause that you'll find yourself highly annoyed and will probably want to turn off the bonus scene feature asap.Sadly, from a cursory glance at the menus, there doesn't seem to be a way to just play the bonus scenes.  Instead you must access them in place.  I could be missing something obvious there, but then again, if it was obvious I don't think I would have missed it.So, to summarize, there's a disappointing story (at least in the theatrical version) that doesn't get the best from the talent on hand, and an even more disappointing presentation of the bonus scenes that make the experience less satisfying than it should be.  Missed it by that much indeed.",Get Smart

263362,"Lost in the flood of great films in Hollywood's greatest year (1939), Stanley and Livingstone pays more attention to historical fact than most so-called history films of that era.Of especial interest is the footage shot in Kenya by among others, the famous Osa Johnson.  The African landscape and peoples shot by this second unit crew raise S&L; far above the usual Tarzanesque studio back lot scenes that supposedly depict Africa (always jungle in those days, never veldt or mountains).  Supervised by one Captain A. J. Klein, the actions shots involving actual Kenyans easily surpasses the competent and workmanlike Hollywood work of director Henry King.The attack by outraged locals (lots of Samburu and Maasai hired for the occasion, I would guess) on Stanley's expedition, who believe it to be another slaver caravan, is a model of how to build excitement and action.  The score here is perfect, and the long shot showing the unwary expedition in the foreground as a distant line representing the first of thousands of plumed warriors appears on the hilly far horizon is the predecessor of similar shots from Spartacus to The Lord of the Rings.A proper DVD, with historical background and perhaps some of the surviving unused footage from Kenya, would be valuable not only as a cinematic gem, but as a cultural document.",Stanley & Livingstone VHS

It whisks you around the world and records all types of human oddities, aimed merely to shock the viewer.I found this film more interesting than shocking though.  This isn't half as dark and brutal as the filmmakers later offering, the horrendous Africa Addio.  Plus overall we've been possibly desensitized by stuff like Faces of Death and other bracing footage caught on the camcorder.This does show some animal killings, but nothing too offensive.  Some snakes getting cut up, wild boars getting bludgeoned to death.  You've probably seen worse.One scene it showed a tribe where the most beautiful women would constantly eat to fatten up and pop out kids for the chief.

115871,"Love Me or Leave Me is the story of Ruth Etting (Doris Day), a real-life jazz singer from the 1920s who made hits with songs like ""Ten Cents a Dance"" and ""You're the Cream in My Coffee."" Her manager Marty Snyder (James Cagney) is an overbearing older man whose love for Etting causes him to bend over backward to help her career. She appreciates him but does not love him, and this unequal feeling between them causes plenty of problems.Although she is obviously a great talent, the casting of Day as Etting is terrible. Etting had a much more subdued voice, so this movie comes out as a showcase for Day's singing talents instead. The song choices are odd too, especially since ""You're the Cream in My Coffee"" is missing. Cagney is very good, but this role is unlike many of his other films, where he is extremely likable in spite of his toughness. Here it is more difficult to care for him. Overall, the main flaw with this movie is the dull storyline. The ascent to stardom is peppered with musical performances, but the movie is thin on plot. The exciting event at the end is too little too late.If you are a fan of either stars, this movie is worth seeing, but unless you adore Day's vocal performances, you will be bored with Love Me or Leave Me.",N/A

1065263,"THE STORY: Rob Roy MacGregor (Richard Todd) is the leader of the MacGregor Clan of Highlanders in Scotland in 1715, and they are unhappy with the domination by the new English king, George I.  Their answer is to rebel with force.  Rob Roy is declared an outlaw, and must constantly avoid capture by the British.  In between he has time to court Helen Mary (Glynis Johns). Helen asks Roy to surrender as she is certain he will be killed. Rob Roy even captures Inversnaid Fort. Terrific costumes and sets in this period piece, along with high adventure and swordplay. I prefer this version of the classic story, for starters it is not depressing or exceedingly violent and gory. It is very family friendly.BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: This was the 4th in a series of live action films shot in Britain, during a period when the assets of American companies, including the Walt Disney Studio, could not be taken out of that country due to the economic devastation they suffered during the WWII. Walt's solution to this was to set up a semi-permanent movie production team in the United Kingdom from the late 1940's to 1954, who were responsible for producing live action movies including in order ""Treasure Island"",  ""The Story of Robin Hood"", and the ""Sword and the Rose"",  and ""Rob Roy"". Richard Todd was the lead actor in the last 3 of the films, appearing along with many other cast and crew that shared credits on all of the films.  This film was the last produced by this U.K. Disney team, and Walt did not return to film there until 1960, with ""Kidnapped"".  Roby Roy was directed by Harold French, since Ken Annakin was prevented by his contract to work on the film as planned. Screenplay by Lawrence E. Watkin, and Walt Disney studio's marketing campaign at the time stated that is was NOT based on the book by Sir Walter Scott, but other historical documents. The tagline for the movie was, ""Every minute flames with furious action!"" . The matte paintings for special effects were by Peter Ellenshaw, who was hired in England to work on Treasure Island and stayed on with the studio for decades, culminating in his receipt of the Academy Award  for Special Effects for his work on Mary Poppins.  The ""Scottish Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders"" appeared in the film on loan from the Scottish Command of the British War Office, appearing as the British soldiers in the movie. One reviewer here thought this was created as a ""Wonderful World of Disney"" television show two part episode.  But actually it was released to theaters first, on February 4, 1954 in the US in glorious Technicolor. It had already premiered in England on October 26, 1953. Two years later it aired as a two-episode title on ABC television's ""Walt Disney Presents Disneyland"" on October 3 and 10, 1956.  The title ""Wonderful World of Disney"" was not used until 1970. In the second episode Disney had to produce some filler material, so they used scenes from ""The Mickey Mouse Club Newsreel"" of Scottish bagpipers. There is an animated segments on persistence, using scenes cut from ""So Dear to My Heart."" The 85 minute movie edit of the film, not the TV edit, was first released to VHS in 1985. Neither the video or the DVD in current release includes the extras created for the television viewing in 1956.",Rob Roy The Highland Rogue

1176646,"PRICELESS ( Hors de Prix) manages to puff along on its rather slim story line and keep the audience interested primarily due to the presence of Audrey Tautou.  Though the script by Benot Graffin and Pierre Salvador is loaded with good lines and despite the fact that director Pierre Salvadori manages to keep the appearance of the film full of glossy fun, the story thins after the first hour and pleads for some tighter editing.The location is the French Riviera and the action takes place in the elegant Biarritz Hotel where we discover Ir&egrave;ne (Audrey Tautou) as a gold digger whose career focus is finding a man of wealth who can support her expensive tastes. Tautou has never looked more glamorous than she does here and we can understand why the sugar daddies of the world vie for her attention.  While preparing for her birthday celebration, Ir&egrave;ne takes too long dressing and her current paramour falls asleep.  Not wanting to be alone on her special day she goes in all her resplendent glory to the hotel bar.  There she meets Jean (Gad Elmaleh) who happens to be the bartender and hotel employee but who Ir&egrave;ne mistakes for a man of wealth.  Their mutual attraction, despite the mismatch of perceptions, results in a wild night of love - Jean being careful not to allow Ir&egrave;ne to know of his true status as a poor worker.  A year passes and the two meet again under similar circumstances and as the true identities are unveiled Ir&egrave;ne teaches Jean how to be a gigolo, only to have the tables turn in a predictable way.This is a bit of French fluff and goes on far too long, but there is Tautou on the screen, beautiful and buoyant and irresistible - and that makes up for a lot.

494131,"When I saw this movie as a kid, it was billed as a murder mystery, and I recall being so horrified as Rex Harrison planned and executed his fiendish and ghastly perfect crime that I wanted to leave the movie theatre; and then when the entire scenario was turned on its head as Harrison actually put what turned out to be a figment of his musical imagination into action--or made a bungling effort to do so--I was very glad I had not left. My sides ached from tear-splashed laughter then, and they still do every time I watch this gem of a film.Now that I am older, I also appreciate what a brilliantly sophisticated comedy Preston Sturges' ""Unfaithfully Yours"" is. Harrison's wit is (pardon the pun) razor sharp. Linda Darnell is stunningly beautiful both as the faithful wife of reality and the guilty wife of Harrison's imagination. The supporting cast, which includes Rudy Vallee as the pompous twit who stirs up the entire tempest in a teapot, and Barbara Lawrence as his acerbic wife, is excellent. Every character, in fact--from the handsome would-be lover down to the detectives, the tailor and the cymbal percussionist--is finely delineated. Even though Rex Harrison is never at home with the conductor's baton and the music-track is a bit dicey after all these years, the film, the DVD of which includes a commentary and a couple of interesting interviews, nevertheless remains priceless.",Unfaithfully Yours VHS
686166,"This French romantic comedy kept my interest mostly due to the twists of the various relationships and the overall fine performances by the cast.  The plot/story was hard for me to follow until 30-40 minutes into the movie due to 2 factors: (1) the frequent changes between the scenes of the touring play and the off-stage lives of the main characters with the other members of the cast and (2) the very slow pace of the first part of the story.  I found Jeanne Balibar's & Sergio Castellito's performances to be excellent, and that helped me to accept more easily the ambiguity of the story line.  I liked the film so much that when I finished watching it once, I watched the first 30-40 minutes of it again so I could enjoy that part of the film more than I did on my first viewing.  While that worked for me, I consider it to be a shortcoming of the film in general.  I also think that I would have enjoyed the film more if it had been carefully edited to be about 30 minutes shorter.",Va Savoir
661777,"I remember watching this when it aired, and how bitterly disappointed I was in it.  I had a feeling that they were going to try and ""Americanize"" the Doctor, and I was right.It starts off with the Master's trial on Skaro (!).  In Doctor Who folklore, that would never happen.  The Daleks would never have a trial for The Master.  The Daleks would more than likely have a trial for the Doctor, who was their arch enemy.  It goes downhill from there.  Eric Roberts is the Master here, and he doesn't really know how to play a renegade Time Lord.  He can be a good actor with good material, but this TV movie was a bone headed decision from the beginning.There are too many special effects (and violence) in this, making it uncomfortable to watch at times and it has none of the wit and intelligence of vintage Doctor Who.  Despite having low expectations going in, the makers of this still managed to exceed those low expectations.On the plus side, Paul McGann is wonderful as the Doctor, and it's a shame that when they started the series again in the U.K., they didn't put him in it as the Doctor.  And it also stinks that in the series' folklore, McGann counts as a regeneration.  He only played the role once, for crying out loud!

It passes those horrible supposed greatest movies of all time like Gone with the Wind and Wizard of Oz. Those movies were predictable. Best musical I've ever seen!!!!! Lets start off with the music. Though Abba was a great band in the 70's, this movie did not ruin my thoughts towards the music. In fact I liked the cast singing Abba's songs then Abba themselves. This movie did Abba's music Justice!!! The casting for the movie was stupendous. Meryl Streep's voice was breath taking in this movie! The emotion she used in the songs were great. The other stars were great, but not going to mention all and ruin the surprises of the film. Some of the parts in the film were very comedic with a little pizaz.Features some great songs such asMamma MiaLay all your love on meThw winner takes it all(favorite of mine)Money Money MoneyHoney HoneyTake a Chance on Meand many more.....................All in All I give this movie 5 stars...10 out of ten...I'd go higher if I could in rating...But I think you get my point...This 2 disc set is definitly worth the price including some exciting extras and deleted scenes and musical numbers not used in the film...",N/A
360172,"I don't know... I liked watching this movie, but did not fall in love with it, as it appears I should have done based on the majority of other reviews, here.A couple of items in The Wicker Man left me cold. In the first place, I found myself roughly sympathetic to the ""pagan"" islanders throughout the film. Not knowing ahead of time what the conclusion would be, I kept hoping that the police officer would ultimately come to realize that they hadn't done anything wrong at all (nor were planning to) -- that he would be shown to be rude, blustery, and offensive for having barged his way into their lives, and tried to force upon them his own morality. That the ""Christian soldier"" would realize that there are potentially good things to be learned from those outside of his own faith. But no, it turns out he was essentially right all along, and just didn't have the man power to shut down what should have been shut down. The pagans turn out to be as wicked as he'd thought they were. That was disappointing.In the second place, I didn't like how, in the end, the police officer becomes such a vociferous advocate of his faith... it seems to make the film a conflict between Christian and Pagan beliefs, with Christianity (naturally) riding with the morally-pure hero. But the truth is that the majority of the film really has nothing to do with either accepting or rejecting Jesus Christ -- the plot could just as easily have been a Christian group being invaded by a Pagan authority. The islanders weren't villainous because they didn't believe in Christ... they were villainous because they wanted to sacrifice a human being against his will. But, the movie didn't seem to realize that, and seems to ultimately agree with our bigoted hero that being Christian = good, and being other-than-Christian = evil.Finally, (and I know it's probably a mistake to look to closely at this for plot holes, etc., but...) it seems bizarre to me that the police officer could have thwarted the entire plot (and thus ruined their May Day plans, and future harvest), by simply giving in to the sexual advances of the hot, blond Landlord's daughter. That just... doesn't track to me, for whatever reason.Other than those slight philosophical disappointments, The Wicker Man was a decent film to watch. It was well-acted, and there were a few times I felt genuinely uneasy. The town had something of the surrealistic and sinister feel of the Village from The Prisoner. Christopher Lee is magnificent (as usual) as the antagonistic Lord Summerisle. Defying pure category, the movie incorporates aspects of a musical, and does it well. It's pretty to look at, and the finale is appropriately stunning and horrific.Not as thoughtful as I wanted it to be -- it contents itself with pre-packaged, mainstream morality when it had the opportunity to extend slightly beyond such -- but good fare nonetheless. Three and a half stars, rounded up to four.",Wicker Man VHS

It goes on and on and on.Bale is terrible as Batman, if you can even call this interpretation of the character Batman - more like Robo-Bat.  Whenever he's in the costume, he puts on this gravely voice that is so over the top, it totally destroys any scene he has to speak in.  He sounds crazier than Joker most of the time.  And the Batman costume looks like something you would see in a cheapo Godzilla movie.A lot of fuss was made about Ledger's performance - but its nothing special at all - just a combination of E.G. Robinson' Little Ceaser and Carey's the Mask.  If you don't believe me, rent Little Ceaser and you'll also see what a good movie is like at the same time.But the real prize for terrible acting and casting goes to Maggie Gyllenhaal who has absolutely no business being in feature films.  She is terrible in the part, and plain old hard on the eyes.  Who does she know?I've seen all of the Batman movies, but the Dark Knight is far and away the worst entry in the series.

1127298,"I must admit that I was hesitant to watch SciFi Channel's revisioning of ""The Wizard of Oz"" due to the fact that they were heavily promoting it.  I've learned through the years that 95% of all films, television series, and music that is heavily hyped is usually not that great in the end.  I was pleasantly surprised with this excellent story written by Craig Van Sickle and Steven Long Mitchell.  The tale centers around D.G., a young girl who doesn't feel like she fits in her hometown.  Her parents always talk of better times in a town that seems otherworldly.  Little does she know that there is another place in the magical and mystical O.Z.  When she's chased into a tornado, D.G. finds herself in a world where the wicked Azkadellia and her goons (including flying monkeys) are out to retrieve a secret from her that she doesn't even know she has.  Along the way, D.G. meets a group of unlikely heroes like the goofy Glitch, the sensitive Raw, and the standoffish Cain.  What's D.G.'s secret? Who's the Mystic Man?  What destiny awaits D.G. and her friends?  Watch ""Tin Man"" to find out.Directed by Nick Willing, ""Tin Man"" features an excellent cast.  The lovely Zooey Deschanel portrays D.G.  Kathleen Robertson is wickedly fun as Azkadellia.  Alan Cumming shines as Glitch, and steals many scenes in this film.  Raoul Trujillo, who's known to fans of SciFi Channel's ""Frankenfish"" as Ricardo, displays solid emotion as the tortured Raw.  Richard Dreyfuss does an excellent, albeit brief, job as the Mystic Man.  Neal McDonough portrays the title character, and his performance begs the question as to why he hasn't broken out as a legitimate star in his own right.The special effects are very good for a made-for-TV story.  The music is above par as well.  Willing drives the story along at a solid pace, littering it with a nice blend of humor, suspense and action.  Fans of  L. Frank Baum's book and the classic film adaptation will see plenty of nods to both.The DVD's special features are okay, but nothing really stands out except for the interviews of the primary cast.  McDonough and Cumming provide the most interesting interviews.  There's a gag reel that's more of a silly documentary than actual goofs. There is also""On The Set With The Director,"" and ""Beyond The Yellow Brick Road,"" which gives the viewer a look behind the scenes.As a whole, SciFi Channel and co. have outdone themselves with this mini-series.  They acquired a solid cast, good special effects and excellent direction and produced a wonderful new vision of a classic tale.  Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and sci-fi as well as fans of children's fantasy tales.  There is a bit of language and some violence, but parents should feel safe letting their older kids (seven and up) watch this film with them.  Just be ready to ""cough"" when Azkadellia make a remark about D.G. and where she happens to be going.",Tin Man

The film, though dark at times (even in the dark shots you could see clearly what was happening), rolled along beautifully. I felt during many moments..that i was there with the actors.The premise wasn't anything new, but it was done in an original way. There was some blood and guts...but it wasn't important either way, I was drawn in to the film as the tension built, and it showed how vulnerable we are when we live in the city...especially in a cramped tenement.It was good to see a horror film that was obviously done by fans who have love for this genre of film, especially in this present day mega-bucked hollywood film making that is plain garbage.Mulberry street was a throwback joint (a back in the days flick),combined with a modern style of film making.

1129015,"When 30 Day of Night first came out in comic form back in 2002, I was only reading comics casually.  Still, I kept hearing more and more about the series.  The first issue had already escalated ridiculously in value and I didn't read it until it was published in collected format.  My initial thoughts upon finishing the book were that it would make a great movie.  The idea of vampires attacking a town near the Arctic Circle that is shrouded in darkness for a month was quite brilliant and terrifying as well.Barrow is that little, Alaskan town whose population is drastically reduced when the Sun finally sets for thirty days.  Most of the inhabitants head for warmer and brighter areas, leaving only the heartiest folk behind.  Using a lead lackey, the vampires cut the town off from the outside world...destroying cell phones, knocking out power and phone lines, and killing all the sled dogs.  The vampires descend upon the town like death itself, killing every person they can find.  Only a small group of survivors led by Sheriff Eben Oleson (Hartnett) and his wife Stella (George), manage to flee the slaughter but will they survive to see the Sun eventually rise?Great care was taken by director David Slade and his team to maintain the look and feel of the comic book.  Slade refers to the look as a ""metallic coldness"" which is a great description of Ben Templesmith's unusual sketchy art style.  The darkness is overwhelming for the residents of Barrow and their feeling of helplessness is quickly evident.  The vampires are not the alluring, seductive type out of an Ann Rice book...these monsters are pure predators, their mouths gape with rows of razor-sharp teeth.  They don't just bite their victims they gnaw and tear at them.  Humans are only food to these creatures.  Slade went so far as to develop a primeval, guttural language for the vampires, although they speak rarely.  Danny Huston is the head vampire and is simply chilling.  He's almost completely emotionless as he leads the vampires through the town.  Their look, language, and mannerisms almost suggest the vampires are not former humans, but a different race altogether.There is some fascinating camera work in 30 Days of Night.  As humans flee down the street we see the vamps following them from the rooftops, stalking them as if it were a game.  There are also some great aerial views that simply show the vampires attacking anything that moves indiscriminately, and it puts the wholesale slaughter into perspective.  Our survivors move from building to building, trying to stay hidden.  This suspense drives much of the middle of the film as they try and figure out their next move.30 Days of Night is not without its weaknesses.  The opening twenty minutes seemed rushed and almost unbelievable that someone could manage to steal and burn the all the town's cell phones.  I mean, I know I'd miss mine if it were gone for more than 15 minutes.  The same rather implausible ending from the comics was carried over to the film.  This is the one area where I had hoped for something a bit grander.  There's not much character development either.  We know that Eben and Stella a re estranged but that sub-plot is never explored in any detail.As a bit of trivia, Mark Boone Junior who plays Beau, also appeared in John Carpenter's Vampires, another outstanding vampire film.  30 Days isn't flawless, but it's certainly one of the best vampire films to come out in a long time.  Return to Barrow Anyone?Extras30 Days of night comes with a nice set of extra features.  The audio commentary features Hartnett, George, and Producer Rob Tapert.  The commentary is very lively and there are none of those uncomfortable periods of dead silence that you sometimes get in commentary tracks.  Hartnett not only read the graphic novel but was determined that the film be as faithful to the comic as possible, which is very refreshing.  One interesting note that George pointed out is that whenever you can see a person's breath in the film, it was all created by CGI.There is an 8 part documentary about the making of the film that can be watched all together or separately.  The entire set runs just under 60 minutes.Some of the more interesting parts include how the vampire actors were instructed how to walk, scream, and attack.  They all had to practice that move of leaping on their prey and tearing at their throats.  There's a look at the various prosthetics that were created and the make-up, including a look at the gruesome beheading of the little girl vampire.As explained in ""The Look"" segment, the dingy, dark-toned look of the characters wasn't achieved with make-up, but rather through digital enhancements.As an added bonus, the DVD feature the first episode of the hit Anime series Blood+",N/A
1148059,"Adam Carolla's first effort as a filmmaker is at some point going to make him into a bonafide movie star.  Carolla has that rare natural talent to be entertaining and spontaneously creative seemingly without effort.  This movie does not have the look and feel of the typical independent movie.  It has the look of a lot of studio polish; the acting and casting is spot on and the plot and story telling are first rate.  It's a good story, well told - the essence of good writing with a proper beginning, middle, and ending.It's amazing that all the elements came together in his first effort.  It's much like a first novel when you are surprised it turns outs to be good.  I'm looking forward to Carolla's next film.  He's playing himself here and so is playing to his strength.  A wise move.  Whatever script he gets next time needs to accommodate Carolla's ability to come up with clever banter as he does daily in his morning radio show.It would be neat if he got cast as a bad guy in a straight action or drama film just to see if he could act as someone other than himself.  With his talent, I think it's a sure thing.  It's probably an even surer bet that his next film will be a comedy and even better than this one.  We're looking at a franchise actor in Adam Carolla.  His star is about to rise even higher.  Talent like this is appreciated because it is so rare.The Hammer is a sure bet.  The ""R"" rating is one of those quirks of the MPAA system.  Any movie that contains the ""F"" word gets the ""R"" rating automatically.  That word is uttered once and in a very humorous context.  This isn't an offensive film by any reasonable standard.

I'm from NY, but live in RI, and I lost former high school classmates and college classmates from the 1980's. The Sandler character used music (instead of drugs/alcohol) in the film to create the diversion that so many people desire when trying not to remember what happened when discussing loved ones lost in 2001. It's a tragic and painful reality that a lot of folks within the immediate New York area still can't comprehend or face. On same note, I find it difficult to emphasize the pain of Pearl Harbor survivors year after year, as I was born 20 plus years later from December 7, 1941.  What a horrifying reality to have to live with the shock of one traumatic day for the rest of one's life.  The film is fair representation of one man's pain and his coping with love, loss, suffering, and reckoning.  The stages of grief (guilt, anger, etc.) are the traits of Sandler's character.  It's a dfferent role for Sandler, but I found it to be a refreshing change. I recommend this film wholeheartedly as a testament to mankind's ability to go on as best we can.

1172688,"First of all, I am a HUGE Dallas fan first and foremost, and was way too young to watch DYNASTY when it was on the air. I did happen to catch the two-part series finale and was immediately attracted to the show. I have held off on buying Season Two and Season Three. From what I have heard there are not enough people purchasing this series for them to release it as a full season. Hence the release of KNOT'S LANDING season one, which Warner Bros. were so put off buy the lack in sales that they refused to bring out season two, and that was like what, three years ago and still no season two. This is my advice, you can still order  DYNASTY season three part one from Borders Bookstores. I already have mine on order, but instead, I will purchase this package.If people keep complaining and boycotting this show, Paramount will more than likely not release anymore. And for those of you with the episodes on vhs, well good for you, I don't have them at all, and I want this full show on dvd, and the series finale, so don't ruin it for everyone else.Is DYNASTY a great show, yes it is, but the tides of time have come and gone and most of the original fans have moved on to other shows or are probably dead. Come on now, I don't mean to be rude by that comment, but alot of fans were the older generation who remember the three main stars in their prime from the 50's and 60's. Look what happened to BIG VALLEY, people boycotted the first part of season two and the studios wouldn't put it out anymore because they are not making enough profit to manufacture the dvds and put them out. Is it overly expensive, yes and no, because they have to hire a designer for the box, re-vamp the episodes so they don't look like crap, and loop the sound and that costs time and money. People don't do work for free, especially in the world of coporate profits and in the Hollywood Land.So if you love DYNASTY, just struggle through ok.

What makes this movie stand out is that although fiction it shows that dogs can turn on people when abused or abandoned.The leader of a pack a Lab mix really gives a good performance he is scary I'll admit!

58085,"This film about the conflict in Northern Ireland between the British and the Irish is extremely well done with a balance between the lives of the characters and the larger structural historic forces that impact their relationships.Daniel Day Lewis plays the character of Danny Flynn, a 32 year old man who has just spent 14 years in prison for IRA activities. When Danny was 18, and an outstanding promising young boxer, he engaged in IRA activities and took a longer sentence so as to protect his colleagues. He returns from prison, not defeated and soul-dead, but philosophically centered. He finds his old boxing coach, who has become a homeless alcoholic, and together they try to establish a sectarian boxing school that allows both Catholic and Protestant boys the opportunity to learn how to box.He leaves prison at a time when critical strategic negotiations are occurring between the IRA and the Belfast Police. Prior to his imprisonment Danny was in love with young Maggie Hamill. After his incarceration she married another IRA man, whom she never really loved. This man is currently imprisoned. There is an IRA social norm that no one courts or has affairs with women whose husbands are imprisoned for the IRA cause, thus strengthening the social norms around terrorist activities. A man who thought his wife might leave him for another man while he was imprisoned would be less likely to commit acts of violence against the British. Thus the IRA maintains a strong social network to ensure that fighters remain loyal. Entire housing projects have been modified so that hidden passages between apartments have been created to allow IRA member to enter one apartment and exit another. The leader, Joe Hamill, played by Brian Cox, is under constant surveillance and therefore must live and operate in this maze.The film's strength is that it perfectly displays the point in an insurrection whereby the insurrection splits between those that are ready to negotiate and end conflict and those that wish to continue the conflict. Joe Hamill has finally reached a point in the negotiation whereby some progress can be made toward peace. The release of Danny Flynn, who has become a neutral partisan after his long incarceration, who at first be an advantage for Joe Hamill. However, the mounting and increased attraction between Danny, and the daughter of Joe, played very well by Emily Watson, violates the IRA norm against courtship of IRA women with imprisoned husbands. This gives the IRA camp that wishes to increase and continue the conflict the very cards they need to play to undermine Joe Hamill.The film has the viewer moving up and down on emotional roller coasters as you become invested in the relationship between Danny and Emily, in Danny's school for young boxers, in Joe's delicate negotiation process, and in the forces that wish to undermine it all because they are so filled with hatred that they emotionally can never give up the desire for revenge. The ending is tense, surprising, and plausible and I don't want to spoil it for future viewers.In the end the screen writers, film makers and actors have give us an incredible gift. The tragedy that surrounds the situation in Northern Ireland is made more real through the struggles of the characters. The complexities of the political situations are made more real through the plot and subplots that move the film forward. You will finish the film with mixed emotions with hope that one day Ireland will be at peace and yet with real knowledge that peace is only obtainable through the work of human intervention, a process fraught with failability.",N/A

1166102,"I've always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Though none of them are as deranged as Duckman. It's been 11 years since the inception of DVD and I've been waiting impatiently this entire time for this show to get a release. Originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 Duckman lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale.The titular character is a discombobulated, unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world. He's a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill in the blank). You name it, Duckman has done it. But who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world he/we live in is so insane, outrageous and just plain nonsensical?Eric Tiberius Duckman(voiced by the maniacal Jason Alexander) could carry the whole show by himself but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. My favorite has to be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partner's infinity of vices and incompetence.The typical plot will involve some bizarre case he'll inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household, though every now and again Duckman's arch-enemy King Chicken (Tim Curry), a sort of Professor Moriarty in fowl form, hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school.Since I was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever surpass it. There never was, or will be, anything quite like Duckman ever again. The level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp it's deadly and the animation is done in that unique Klasky/Csupo style (anyone who has seen Rugrats will understand). It's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish, 1940s feel.I do hope this DVD set gives us all of the episodes complete and uncut. I cannot wait to get my hands on it and I eagerly await seasons 3 and 4. Plus, for all you other fans, check out theDuckmanvideo game. You can never have too much of this bird!",N/A

Eventually, it is obvious that they are not alone and the inhabitants of the forest are none too happy about their visit either.The first half of the film is filled with dry british humor (think The Office) and is actually quite funny.

587367,"Well. Not a film that I would recommend to anyone except serious film buffs who can stomach some pretty rough material. I barely made it through one scene...however, it's tamer than Solondz's previous films.One can sense that Solondz is merely attacking his critics, and is using satire to do so. He pulls no punches, and as usual, remains as cynical as ever. The performances are great all around. The film is split into two parts, ""Fiction"" and ""Non-fiction"", which seem unrelated at first. It's not until after the film ends, that you can pick up on the subtle connections between the two. Once again, not a film that I would recommend to just anyone, but if you are familiar with Solondz at all, it's worth a shot...however, there are two scenes here that are rough and a bit gratuitous in nature.

The focus is on the main character, as it should be, as well as how the outbreak happened and how he struggles to fix what he started. Millions of ""Virus Outbreak Mutation"" films have been devised over the past few decades, which makes I Am Legend even that much more impressive. It never feels like it belongs in the genre due to the multi-layered nature of the piece, as well as the clever progression and documentary-like feel.Francis Lawrence made an impressive debut with Constantine, and I Am Legend proves that he's on track to becoming one of the defining filmmakers of our generation, just as Spielberg and Scorsese defined their's.",I Am Legend

Life is normally mundane for the Cybercrime division (taking down the normal teenage identity thief) , but all that is about to change with a cat...Untraceable's suspense never lets up , and with quick witty dialog by the characters (and a great performance by Tom Hank's son, Collin Hanks) the movie is over even before it starts.

In fact from the opening of Untraceable you would think this will occur, but Untracacle's director, Gregory Hoblit is extremely skillful and takes his cues from Alfred Hitchcock and just shows enough for our imagination to take over for the rest.From the teenager to the baby boomer Untraceable offers something for everyone, action, suspense, an intelligent story that is relevant to our times, and something to keep everyone entertained during the cold days of winter-- Nathan M Rose (flickdirect.com)",N/A

307182,"This is an amusing comedy about how many neighborhoods use to be in NYC.  Although there are many stereotypes, much of the characters and atmosphere rings true. People seeing this film back in the early 1990s still had many reasons to fear NYC.  Having resided all my life in NYC I know what the movie is trying to show here.  Many neighborhoods in Manhatten, as well as the adjacent boroughs were mostly slums in the 1970s, 80s and well into the early 90s.  A variety of circumstances over the years had placed low income people into cheap housing with repacious landlords.  The end result were horrific ghettos which were virtual war zones to live in.The ironic thing today in watching this film is how we have traded in the urban ghetto for Starbucks!  NYC rents were affordable when there was a bit of a seedy element around.  The buildings shown in this film today would be lauded as a pre-war luxury apartments with Joe Pesci's place going for millions!  NYC may be a safer place to live, but who can afford to live here now!The film shows in a funny way the noises and atmosphere of what ghetto neighborhoods were like.  There were places like Bed Sty, East New York, and the South Bronx etc., that brought shudders to any New Yorker when their names were mentioned in the news!  Having lived through those times, I know the kind of people and circumstances which were involved, and while I would never want NYC to return to those days, at the same time one hates to see their own city become a heaven for the jet-set, wine and cheese crowd! Surely there must be some kind of compromise that could work for NYC in the future.This film provides a rare, vintage look of a time not so long ago in the city's history.  While exaggerated and funny, most of what's shown here is pretty accurate.  Let THE SUPER be an example of what most landlords are in NYC, as well as many other cities.

804262,"The dreamiest and most oblique of Robert Altman's '70s classics (granting that IMAGES and QUINTET cannot plausibly be deemed ""classics""), 3 WOMEN is a compellingly weird bit of self-indulgence from the deepest recesses of Altman's brain.  In fact the director has revealed that the genesis of this movie was an actual dream he had, and it shows in the movie's atmospheric visuals, deliberate pacing and aura of mystery.  Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA also seems to be an influence, as this film encroaches on similar territory of two women living together whose identities seem to merge in ambiguous ways.  The pairing of Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall, two of the most unique and odd female presences in '70s cinema, contributes to the offbeat personality of this ""only-in-the-70s"" American art film.  I wouldn't call it one of Altman's best, but it's a fascinating artifact of a period where such compellingly weird bits of self-indulgence were financed and released by the major Hollywood studios.",3 Women

375588,"Christmas is a time of goodwill, cheer and joy. Barring that, it can also be a time of random violence, phone perverts and flying fruitcakes.Guess which kind of movie ""Mixed Nuts"" is.And while the first half of the movie is a bit slow-moving, this mildly warped Steve Martin comedy tackles the ongoing woes of a bunch of lonely, rather crazy people thrown together on Christmas Eve. While it techically contains a heartwarming message, Nora and Delia Ephron prefer to focus on the increasingly frenetic characters and their escalating problems.Philip (Martin) has just received an eviction notice for his suicide hotline, though he neglects to tell his coworkers, mousy Catherine (Rita Wilson) and sooty Mrs. Munchnik (Madeline Kahn). To make matters worse, Mrs. Munchnik gets stuck in the elevator, and Philip is unceremoniously dumped by his chilly fiancee.As Philip tries to deal with his deteriorating life, the hotline receives some oddball Christmas guests -- insane pregnant Gracie (Juliette Lewis), depressed drag queen Chris (an unrecognizable Liev Schreiber), and some dork with a ukelele (Adam Sadler). And since Gracie gave Catherine a makeover, Philip is starting to see her with new eyes.Unfortunately, Gracie has just dumped her penniless artist boyfriend Felix (Anthony LaPaglia) -- and he runs in with a gun. Several gunshots later, the ""mixed nuts"" find themselves in extremely deep trouble -- their shared Christmas present is a dead body.""Mixed Nuts"" has two things I personally like: a warped holiday spirit, and a bunch of people as pathetic as I am. Admittedly the plot starts rather slowly, with amusing but not hugely funny jokes (including a Madeleine Kahn rapping a plea for help from a stalled elevator) and the impending destruction of the ""Lifesavers"" suicide line.But after the cast is introduced to one another, the subplots and running jokes tighten into a solidly-written little whirlwind, where seemingly random elements turn out to important. And as if the plot weren't wonderfully frenetic enough, the Ephrons sprinkle in some running gags about a fruitcake, a dog-lover, a pair of vengeful rollerbladers, a phone pervert and a kelp-strewing serial killer who is a lot closer than anyone thinks.And Delia and Nora Ephron do a good job weaving in some understated romances (including a rather sweet one between Chris and Ukelele Dork), and switching between heartwarming and mockery of the same (""There is hope in every pothole!""). And it has some truly awful songs from Ukelele Dork (""I like eating cheese, it taste very nice. Everyone likes cheese, especially white mice"").Martin plays a surprisingly restrained role: a good-hearted but socially-inept man whose world is crashing around his ears. Rita Wilson is sweet as his kindly coworker, and Kahn is an absolute riot (""Men would have sex with a tree!""). Schreiber does a brilliant job balancing Chris' loneliness with some gutsplitting comedy -- especially when it's revealed that Chris has a VERY low pain threshold.Additionally, LaPaglia and Lewis both do an excellent job as crazed soulmates who unfortunately have managed to procreate, and Rob Reiner has a fun cameo as a vet who is constantly called upon to minister to human animals. And Adam Sandler is... Adam Sandler. Interpret that as you will.The title of ""Mixed Nuts"" pretty much tells you what the movie is about -- it's a Yuletide comedy that balances out heartwarming romance with warped, mildly sick comedy.

154741,"I see that there is some controversy here over whether the new Criterion transfer is an improvement on the 2002 MGM transfer or not. So I compared the MGM and Criterion DVD editions of this movie (which I love) on my 60-inch Hitachi HDTV today by syncing them up on two different DVD players and swapping the picture back and forth between them. I then switched the discs between the players and repeated the test. Other than a tiny sliver more picture information at the top and left on the Criterion disc, and a sliver more on the bottom of the MGM disc, they appear virtually identical. There is no significant difference that I can see in terms of color balance or saturation, brightness, contrast, shadow/highlight detail, or cleanliness of the prints. Criterion claims to have cleaned up ""thousands"" of instances of speckling and spotting, but the MGM print looks very clean to me, with little or no noticeable dirt or damage. In short, unless you really want the extras, or don't own the MGM edition, there is really no reason to upgrade as far as I can tell. Other than the digital cleanup that was supposedly done I can't understand how Criterion can claim that this version is ""from restored film elements"", other than to con potential buyers into buying a movie that they probably already own. I bought the Criterion release partly for the extras but was expecting a superior transfer based on their pre-release publicity, and now I feel just slightly ripped off considering the premium price they are charging for this set. The extras are nice to have but hardly merit charging double what the MGM DVD retailed for. Of course if you don't have the MGM edition (which is now out of print) then this is a worthy purchase, but as I would expect that most hardcore fans of this movie scooped up on the MGM disc as soon as it was released, this seems a little like double-dipping. At any rate, the bottom line is that anyone trying to tell you that either version is markedly superior in terms of picture quality hasn't done their homework. As anyone who knows anything about computer graphics will tell you, there are so many variables involved in displaying color on a monitor or on the Web that comparisons made by examining screen grabs on the Internet are all but worthless. As long as I'm on the subject, not all of Criterion's transfers are necessarily superior to those available from other DVD manufacturers. For instance, Image Entertainment's transfers of Warhol's Blood for Dracula and Flesh for Frankenstein blow the (out of print) Criterion editions off the map in every possible way. So don't assume that just because it says Criterion on the box you're getting a superior product.All in all, Thief of Bagdad is a personal favorite and one of the greatest adventure fantasies ever filmed. I'm only knocking one star off of what should be a five-star rating because of Criterion implying that you're getting a much improved transfer when you are not.",N/A

1198068,"I think what makes this movie work at all--given a script that is pretty much a mess and acceptable but not laudable direction--is the chemistry of stars Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway, combined with the good-will the original series instills in the viewer.  Carell, who has--thank goodness-- never been as far over the top and annoying as Jim Carrey, plays things fairly realistically. His agent 86 is immensely likable.  Hathaway, while lacking some of the ooomph of Barbara Feldon, is believable as Agent 99 and charming without being sex-potted up.  Dwayne Johnson presents a nice performance and, as usual, the under utilize Alan Arkin and Terence Stamp are admirable for what they bring to the table.  I think if your expectations of this are low, you'll likely end up enjoying far more than you'd think.  If you're expecting something that is a direct copy of the original, you'll likely disappointed.  Still, from the opening credits to the last frame, despite its many flaws, this movie manages to capture the spirit of the original and serves as a decent homage.",Get Smart

So, of course, just like I did with *Fantastic Four*, I had to check out this film.I was actually disappointed in *Iron Man*, giving it a grade of C.Tony Stark heads out to the Middle East to demonstrate his newest weapons.  However, he's kidnapped and ordered to develop a new weapon for the terrorists.  Stark and a fellow prisoner develop a weapon but specifically designed for Stark to escape from the terrorists.After escaping, Stark puts all of his efforts to perfecting his armored suit.  When done, Stark, as Iron Man, returns to the Middle East to tie up loose ends.  However, it's not over for Iron Man as he soon discovers that there's someone within his company that is out to destroy him.*Iron Man* spent too much time on the terrorist angle and on Stark's perfecting work on the armored suit.  So, we get to see little action and abilities of Iron Man.  I do get it that this is the first movie and it takes time to develop the story of how Iron Man came to be.  However, if you spend too much time on the background, you risk losing your viewers' interest.  I went with friends, which we are diehard Marvel fans, but found ourselves fidgeting with boredom within minutes and suffered til the end.Again, was disappointed with *Iron Man*.  Sure do hope that the sequel(s) will be way better as seen in the *Fantastic Four* movies.",N/A

Set in Eastern Europe, shot in Scotland, starring Ray Stevenson and costing a little over 1 million, you might be pleasantly surprised at the quality of this movie. Genuine tension is offset with sparing gore. Great gun battles and some Nazi voodoo technology thrown in for good measure make this micro-budget effort well worth watching. There are some great characters from all over the world dying in some really creative ways and some pretty nasty baddies lurking in a pretty scary environment.Why not bypass the hollywood dross and see how a bunch of enthusiastic Scottish film-makers do things.

1073855,"I loved the Tick when it originally aired, and went on to enjoy the comics as well. Season two contains some of my favorite Tick episodes, and it is great to finally see them on DVD.If you love satire, screwball humor, or hilarious moral messages, you'll love the tick. This show kept spot on faithful to the Tick of the comics and brought him into an animated world that a character like him could really thrive in. This is entertainment great for kids and adults alike. I doubt you will be disappointed with the show itself.The DVD however is another story in itself. Why they keep cutting out episodes is beyond me. The Mole Men episode from season one wasn't too much of a loss, but will hopefully be on an upcoming DVD. This season really lost a great one though. ""Alone Together"" is one of the best Tick episodes that aired, and it is completely missing from this collection. My only hope is that this episode, and possibly the mole man episode make it on to the Season Three DVD. This all is kind of strange to me. The UK seasonal DVD's contained all of the episodes. In fact, there is actually a three disk boxed set you can get on Amazon UK if you can play region 2 DVDs.These DVD's also seem to be lacking any sort of feature. The story of how the Tick came to get published is certainly interesting enough to warrant, at the very least, a five minute featurette. Instead we get ads for unrelated shows.Overall, above-par episodes, sub-par DVD. Let's hope The Tick Vs. Season Three redeems the seasonal DVDs.-Matt",The Tick Vs. Season 2

I really tried to watch this movie but could never finish it both times that I had given it a 2nd chance.  It was so slow and boring and, also irksome was the fact that the traumatized patient of the car accident and the events that followed at times seem absolutely unconnected to the basic plot of the movie.  The delusional scenes are, at least for my taste, far too many and make the film confusing to follow.The main actor was doing a good job, but couldn't rescue the movie.  I really disliked this movie, most of all because of its immensely slow pace. I hate DVDs like that.  At times the movie really felt like it was not just tiresomely dragging on but as if it had actually come to some sort of stand still juncture that didn't seem to end.To make a long store short, skip this one, unless you enjoy being bored.",Trauma
762344,"The love of Lydia is the story of an heiress who grows up amid aristocratic society of the 1920s to 1930s England. Lydia is beautiful and lives life through a self-centered personality that makes men fall passionately in love with her while she simply toys with their emotions, not caring a bit for the pain and suffering she causes to others wherever she goes.The story is filmed with the exquisite care of every detail that PBS Masterpiece Theatre provides. The development of the characters is so magnificent that we found ourselves discussing the exchanges that take place as Lydia demands that all men she meets cater to her wishes. Lydia is selfish, arrogant, and egotistical. Her ways bring up consequences that put an end to the life of one of her suitors and put her own health in jeopardy.If you have teenagers around, this is a great series of episodes to watch and discuss to ensure personal growth and understanding of human nature, choice and the consequences of living life without a care for others.We highly recommend purchasing the set and watching these episodes with your friends if you want the lively discussions that will make this a memorable experience.",Love for Lydia

94028,"It's funny when you look at the old (by old I mean Burton and onward) Batman films in contrast to the recent Nolan masterpieces; they just don't stand up.  `Batman Returns' is probably the better of the previous four, but even still it's apparent that Tim Burton was missing the point.I'm going to say this upfront, as a longstanding fan of Batman in every shape and form he comes in, that Batman is a very serious comic.  The one thing that makes Batman so great is that he is not a superhero in the essence that he has superpowers or superhuman abilities.  He's a superhero in that he is a man trying to avenge a city; just a man, in a suit, kicking butt.  The villains he encounters are not superhuman or mutated or anything of the sort.  For the most part (with some exceptions) they are regular people who are either violently insane or just violent.  The reason I say that Burton misses the point is that he insists on making Batman and the people around him more than what they are.  They become caricatures of their former selves.Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't.I am one of the few who thinks that Jack Nicholson's performance in `Batman' was horrendous (the more I think about it the more I wish I had given the film a C) and especially after watching Heath Ledger's (R.I.P.) marvelous performance in `The Dark Knight' I have grown to detest what Nicholson had done all the more.  That said, Danny DeVito can sit right alongside Jack.  His interpretation of The Penguin is so horrifically altered from what it should have been that I am sick to my stomach when I think about it.  He just went right for the obvious, sort of like Nicholson.The film finds Batman in a bit of a bundle.  Penguin, a crazy man from the sewers, has teamed up with tycoon Max Shreck in an attempt to control the city of Gotham, steal its electricity and destroy Batman's good name.  While he is struggling with this power couple he has to contend with the ravaging Catwoman, a disgruntled employee of Shreck's who has an agenda all her own.Thankfully Burton infuses enough darkness into his newly crafted Gotham to make up for many of his unfortunate misinterpretations, and in the end the film comes off much more rewarding than its predecessor.  This is also thanks in large part to a wonderfully inspired performance by Michele Pfeiffer.  As Catwoman she is obviously having fun with her character's puns but she does so in such a convincing and effortless way.  Where DeVito comes off forced and contrived Pfeiffer comes of elegant and commanding.  Her performance has been rendered as the greatest comic book performance of all time, and that may be correct (although Ledger was utterly flawless on so many levels).In the end I hand the film a B, for its better than the rest of the bunch (pre-Nolan bunch) but it never manages to connect all the dots.  I love Burton's style, but in my opinion he is too cartoonish for Batman.  He may have seemed like a perfect match at the time, but in retrospect he just didn't get it.",N/A

658656,"First and foremost, enter this film knowing that you're not going to get any answers. No brilliant scientist or smart mouthed guy is going to explain what is happening halfway through.  The main characters know about as much as we would know if this was happening to us. That's one of the brilliant touches with Cloverfield, that nothing is spoon fed to us.  I'm a bit bored with movies that over explain everything so Cloverfield's ambiguity and less-is-more attitude is refreshing.Outside of that, this is one of the most original (after giving props to Godzilla and Blair Witch Project) and exciting monster movies I have seen in a long time that exceeds the hype surrounding it. Yes, there's some shaky camera work, yes the character's actions are a bit far fetched and yes it raises more questions than answers (did the soldiers shoot the girl or did she explode?) but I didn't have a problem with that at all.  I was on the edge of my seat, my heart machine gun pounding against my chest, from the first explosion to the last. This is what a movie going experience is all about:  complete immersion in the story from first frame to last.My only beef is Hud. He says Rob's name at least a half million times during the course of the movie which drove me slightly crazy.

There was a test given toKundun to prove his purpose after he succeded they moved him and his family to Lhasa. After the boy was removed from his homeland the monks raised him as the re3incarnation of Budda, the most powerful leader in Tibet. It was interesting to see how a young Kundun, just fourteen was conventially appointed to the throne as the Chinese invasion began. The Chinese had wanted Tibet to become a part of them but the people refused.  The movie contiounes through his growth into adulthood and displays the trials he is faced with alomg the way. The whole story was revolved around Kundun's and the Tibet people before and during the invasion of their country. Eventually the Dalai Lama had to flee to India and live in exile for the rest of his life.I have never watched ""Seven Years in Tibet"" completely through however what I have seen is similar to ""Kundun"" . All in all the movie seem to be a good movie for the whole family. Although there may be some scenes that small children would have a problem with. The way the young child grew and took respondsiblity for his country which had suffering, showed the courage that different culture take.

This film is not interested in politics, nor does it discuss horrific atrocities, nor does it portray great conquest (only brief visits to the sincized Jurchens are shown).

1101837,"A film like Sunshine is among the group of movies that get released every year where critics and moviegoers sing its praises and can look past its faults yet it never gets huge box-office and merely becomes one of those sleeper or cult hits. I was a fan of Danny Boyle's best-known work, Trainspotting and I liked 28 Days Later (although oddly I like its sequel better) but I always looking forward to Sunshine although couldn't see it until recently thanks to a shoddy local theater and after viewing it, I wouldn't say it's my favorite film of last year but it's certainly on the list.It's 2057 and the sun is dying, leaving Earth in freezing weather and winters so a mission is put into action: with the help of the ship, the Icarus I and a bomb the size of Manhattan, the crew intend to put the Sun back to full bloom and prevent the Earth from entering a new ice age. But something goes awry and contact is lost so a second team, the Icarus II, is sent to finish what the other crew didn't. But worries of failure of this mission, the fate of the entire human race resting in the hands of 8 crew members and then there's the reappearance of the Icarus I and the trouble it will take to succeed.Instead of space films like Event Horizon, Alien and the like, Sunshine is more about existential matters and showing awe-inspiring imagery rather than just going for cheap thrills and quick entertainment. With the help of a fantastic score, many scenes in Sunshine go for a more emotional punch than most space movies that are thankfully not as abstract and dense like 2001. And while I don't mind its third act, many people might find an issue with its tonal change and breaking the feel that the entire film was establishing to that point (although I love the scene that introduces this shift).Writing characters are a tricky business since if you give them distinct personas or quirks (often called one-note characters), people find them too cookie cutter and not enough substance whereas if you give everyone gravitas and weight, they don't become distinct and instead just become part of a group rather than singular, unique characters. But like Alien, the crew is very distinct and each do their parts well although some aren't given much to do. One character, for example, is so fascinated with the sun that he likes to watch it from an observation deck at varying brightness (over 4%, it can burn out your retinas) but other than that, it doesn't do much. The more memorable ones are Cillian Murphy, the ship's ""bomb boy"", Chris Evans as the straight-thinking one and uber-cutie Rose Byrne.With a unique visual style not commonly seen in space movies, a beautiful score and some great visual effects, Sunshine is a worthwhile film to check out.",N/A

736087,"The middle segment in this trilogy, written by the director Francis Ford Coppola and his daughter, is--pretty clearly--a thinly disguised portrait of, that's right, the director and his daughter (and wife). The daughter is spoiled rotten and shows that off in just about every scene. Don Novello as her protector/butler puts in some good acting chops, and there's a nifty bit for Chris Elliot as an upscale crook, but otherwise this isn't much.The high points are the first and last segments. As a passionate obsessive ego-maniacal artist, Nick Nolte--in Martin Scorsese's Life Lessons--is absolutely perfect. He dominates this piece, as well he should, frenziedly painting his huge canvases while soaking in 70s rock--especially Procol Harum, Cream, and Bob Dylan. Rosanna Arquette, as his sexy assistant, provides the complementary tension he needs to give this intense piece its powerful momentum. This is a superior short film, one of the best in the last 20 years.Woody Allen's closing piece, Oedipus Wrecks, is a spiffy closer in which the viewer gets to see Larry David (of Curb Your Enthusiasm) circa 1989, and in which the protagonist's (Woody) mother winds up as a floating head in the Manhattan skyline.

It was a totally unepxected surprise to see MC Hammer as Roy Thunder. That was so funny and worth the purchase price right there. Hammer should be in more films because he can really act. In fact, one of the funniest lines in Finishing the Game, is when MC Hammer says, ""I'm always on the lookout for the next Pat Morita.""After Bruce Lee died, several Asian actors tried to make Bruceploitation movies that had such stupid titles as Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave and Re-enter the Dragon. The Hong Kong film industry was in a panic to try to prolouge Bruce Lee's star power as long as they could by hiring look-a-likes and wannabes. Lin wonderfully satirized that with Fists of Fuhrer and he nailed it in the character Breeze Loo.This film is also a look at how Asian actors were treated for a long time by Hollywood in such roles as delivery boys and servants. The real Bruce Lee did a lot to try to change the way Asians are looked at in film. Ironically because of Lee's achievements, now Hollywood is trying to sell Asians as martial arts stars, which means that few Asians are represented as being real. They are mostly reduced to oriental exoticism to sell tickets. Hollywood has yet to make a movie with Asians actors that really show a good well written story that doesn't exploit.This movie is a lot of fun.

549538,"I just recently broke down and ordered two volumes out of this 10 set series of ""Lost Films of laurel and Hardy""(Volumes six-this one-and three):of Laurel and Hardy and Laurel and Hardy-related silent shorts.When I viewed them,I,nearly broke down.What a disappointment.This series has been on the market for about eight years now.I had already purchased quite a number of just the Laurel and Hardy shorts by themselves on VHS(VERY pricey!),which explains why I hesitated so long to buy them again on DVD.But I took the plunge,and definitely regretted it after what I saw.It seems it is getting harder and harder these days to trust ANY kind of marketing relating to any DVD releases,particularly when it comes to older films like these, and these releases just reinforce that distrust.To begin with,absolutely NONE of these films have been remastered in any way whatsoever visually,only a scant few have had part or all of their soundtracks remastered.All sources that have been used in the making of these films have been taken from existing master tapes of various origins from which only the producer Michael Agee knows for sure,but some of which we can be fairly certain of as you will see.About the only ""new"" thing about these films and apparently in reality about THE ONLY good selling point is the added soundtracks taken from the original Vitaphone sound discs.But they even had to push this too far by adding the Vitaphones to every other short in this collection that never had them in the first place!The two best that come closest to complete prints and in pretty decent shape are ""That's My Wife"" and(with a BIG reservation) ""Flying Elephants"".Let's start the ball rolling with the latter.The print of ""Elephants"" as I say is overall pretty darn good BUT except for an annoying square box in the right bottom area of the film....from beginning to the end!! I had to rub my eyes,thinking I was seeing things.And it isn't small,it distracts you constantly throughout the watching of the film. Whoever put it there is obviously hiding something,probably a ""banner"" of some kind on the tape this film was produced from.My guess would be Blackhawk films,but your guess is as good as mine.""Putting Pants on Philip"" is in not too bad of shape but I was disappointed in the film footage gaps that were extant.It's one of my all time favourite Laurel and Hardy shorts too.""Crazy like a Fox"" is a Charly Chase short and in poor shape;not a good print.""The Soilers"" is a Stan Laurel short and in God-awful shape.This short should run around 23 minutes.This truncated version runs a scant 10 and the print looks like something picked out of a garbage can.Lastly there is ""45 Minutes from Hollywood"".If ""The Soilers"" didn't get my goat bad enough this one topped them all.If you didn't believe me when I said these films are taken from existing master tapes THIS is the proof.Less than a minute into the film and continuing throughout the picture are very visible and annoying VIDEO LINES!! Yes that's right,those lovely little annoyances I just recently took the creators of the newly produced ""McHales Navy"",Shout Factory,to task on in their release of that series third season.And we can't forget also the Hallmark Laurel and Hardy DVDs that also have video lines.As I have said before;video lines are absolutely unforgivable.It shows a complete lack of respect for:1)The product,and2)The consumer.Let's move on and look directly at what is printed on every one of these releases.""...their original Vitaphone soundtracks have been restored from vintage 16"" phonograph recordings made in the 1920s"".Sounds great,right? Every silent film buffs dream come true?If you look closely at the notes for the indiviudal releases for each movie they mention the Vitaphone soundtracks included.Some will actually tell you that the Vitaphone disc is specifically from and for that particular movie;for example,""Original Vitaphone music and Effects soundtrack"".Those are the ONLY ones to believe.Any others that say something like "" Vitaphone soundtrack and effects"" or just ""music and effects"" are NOT from or for the movie you are watching;which appears to be the case with the majority of shorts in this series,whether Laurel and Hardy or not.They found some original discs for some films but the majority are lost and have used an amalgam of what discs they do have to provide accompaniment for the rest of the shorts in this series.It does get stale very quickly listening to the same music over and over and over again.""These vintage films have been meticulously digitally restored from the original 35mm negatives,dupe negatives or new safety fine grains"".Another piece of great restoration right?Remember what I said about ""45 Minutes from Hollywood""? That's right,TAPE LINES!! What this tells us is NONE of this material has been remastered...none.It has been digitally transferred;that's it.What movie hasn't in recent years since the advent of digitalization?? Transferred from....?? Master Tapes.""45 Minutes.."" proves that beyond a shadow of doubt.You have to read between the lines here.When they restored from 35 mm negs and dups you have to ask ""When were they restored""? My answer would be many,many years ago for most of this material,if not all, by people not even associated with the current producers of this DVD compilation.Want proof? If the covering up of the logo in ""Flying Elephants"" in this volume isn't enought to convince you,then go to Volume Three of this series.The first film on that DVD is ""Liberty"".A very good print one must admit.However what does one see in the opening credits? The good old Hal Roach plaque!! The same plaque used for all TV releases for the 1950s and onwards!! So the impression they give that these are NEWLY restored films is plain bunk,through and through.You can bet these films were transferred to tape years ago,taken from sources sometimes good(35 mm negs)and very bad(terrible mutli-generational dupes) and thrown together to get as close as they can to complete prints.Sometimes it works nicely,other times you just want to throw the DVD out the window.""These films have never been shown on television and most have never been released for home video"".I think the above example of ""Liberty"" destroys the first point of never having been shown on TV before;completely.Most if not all HAVE been seen on TV since the 1950s(the Laurel and Hardys in particluar) and I personally recall having seen them.Then they say that most have not been released on home video.Technically I suppose the Laurel and Hardy-related films out number the actual Laurel and Hardys so I guess they can claim that ""most"" of the films haven't been on home video( even that is arguable).But if we are speaking of just Laurel and Hardys,Hal Roach themselves released all of them themselves on home video(VHS) before putting them onto DVD!I bought them as did many others.The fact that they just didn't bother to change the package blurbs from VHS to DVD is the culprit here.Some of the releases mention that these DVDs couldn't have been released without the ""assistance of..."",usually film historian and preservationist David Shephard(who has done tremendous work in his field,especially on Chaplin material) and,on this Vol.6 release,by Serge Bromberg of Lobster Films in Paris.I have reviewed two DVD releases by Serge and Lobster films,""Flying Deuces-the Restored Version"" and ""Slapstick Emporium-The Stan Laurel Years,Vol#1 and both are highly recommended.I mention this because I think both David and Serge held back ,kept the good stuff for themselves and gave Michael Agee the leftovers for this release.""The Soilers"" is a good example.As I said above it is an absolute truncated abomination of a print.Want an excellent,full print? Get Serges' Stan Laurel ""Slapstick Emporium"" release where it sits in all its' full(24 minutes) and crisp,glorious splendor for all to see.In conclusion this DVD of ""Lost Films"",which were not lost(ANOTHER misleading statement) is a complete disappointment and an unmitigated failure on the part of the producer Mr.Agee.The liner notes give us false  and misleading statements throughout leading the potential buyers of these products assuming they are getting one thing when they are actually getting something altogether different.Under close scrutiny they just do NOT hold up at all.Let me be clear.As one of the Boys most devoted and biggest fans,there is nothing I'd rather do more than give them a ten star rating(if it was possible) for their great performances in these films;as they deserve nothing less.It is the visual aspect(as opposed to the performing aspect)of these releases that so degrade my appreciation that I can not in good conscience give this release any more than I have.Not only is it an insult,as I have already stated,to the product and the consumer it is the greatest insult to the memories of the greatest screen comedians there have ever been;Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.And in their name I will never accept such shoddy workmanship as the producers of this release,and others that have come before would have us do,as any where near ""acceptable"".....NEVER!The only releases acceptable and worthy of appreciation are the recent MGM and Fox films(see my reviews for those).Avoid these releases altogether.The Laurel and Hardy product in North America AGAIN gets short shrifted.Will it never end?","The Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy: The Complete Collection, Vol. 6"

1132368,"""Enchanted"" (2007) has to be one of my favorite Disney movies in years; it is a return to the type of classic movies that were produced under Walt's supervision, but it also acknowledges the times we live in without being too negative. Right off the bat, I was amazed to be able to watch a film that had no profanity and other than the topic of divorce, hardly any adult situations. Of course, there is some 'wink-wink' adult humor that will go over the head of children, but even that is pretty tame. How refreshing to know that an excellent movie can be made without looking like the 10pm news or a tawdry reality show. PLENTY of fun references to vintage Disney films, and a number of cameos by some Disney favorites.The film begins as a typical classic Disney animated film would; Julie Andrews narrates the story of Prince Edward (James Marsden) from Andalasia, who must find his true love to marry, and his evil stepmother Narissa (Susan Sarandon), who does not want to step down from her throne and will do whatever she can to thwart Edward's search. Enter Giselle (Amy Adams), a maiden of the forest with plenty of animal friends. She too is searching for her true love, and through song and fate, Edward & Giselle meet, fall in love, but are separated by Narissa, who sends Giselle out of the toon world and into the harsh reality of present day New York City. While Edward and Giselle attempt to reunite, a hardened divorce attorney, Robert (Patrick Dempsey) & his daughter attempt to help her along the way. Giselle's positive attitude and belief in true love has a profound effect on Robert, who has apparently been embittered by his own divorce (what actually happened to his first wife is somewhat nebulous, and basically left open for interpretation). Robert is already seeing someone; Nancy (Idina Menzel) is the romantic girl he has been dating for the last five years. No plot spoilers here; you will have to see how it all comes together.This film rests on the able shoulders of Amy Adams; in the role of Princess Giselle, she could have easily done a parody of Snow White, Cinderella, and the other Disney Princesses. However, she brings warmth, charm, humor, and great emotion to her character; she is totally believeable. James Marsden again shows off his tremendous vocal talent, and as a toon Prince, he gives a letter perfect performance. Although he is a little one-dimensional at times, it works perfectly with the plot and how the movie progresses. Dempsey also does a wonderful job in his role, with just the right amount of bitterness; it is very apparent that he underneath he believes in romance but what happened with #1 has forced him to change. The only weak link in the cast is Sarandon, which is a shame. She is one of our finest actresses, and yet her characterization just misses the mark for me; she lacks the power and evil that we expect from a Disney Villain; in the climax of the film, she almost appears to be yawning through her part. It is the power and force of a Disney Villain that makes their ""fall"" so enjoyable; evil must be very evil for the triumph of good to be truly satisfying. Still, it hardly detracts from the overall product. The songs in this film will stay with you after you watch the movie...in a good way. Rarely have I immediately been overcome with the desire to purchase the soundtrack from a film in recent years. Overall, a definite 5 stars for this movie.The DVD is a different story; although there are extras, it does seem like Disney skimped on them. The highlight is the behind-the-scenes look, ""FANTASY COMES TO LIVE,"" at 3 sequences: ""Happy Working Song,"" ""That's How You Know,"" and the Ballroom finale sequence. Seeing the layering of the CGI effects and Amy Adams having to ""act"" to nothing (""Happy Working Song"") gives an even greater appreciation of her talent. You will also learn that one of the dancers from ""Mary Poppins"" has a cameo in the ""That's How You Know"" number. There is also an ""extra,"" PIP'S PREDICAMENT: A POP-UP ADVENTURE, that tells the tale of Pip's alerting Edward that Giselle was no longer in Andalasia. MAYBE very young children will find this amusing, but personally, it was a little on the lame side. There is also a ""Hidden Mickey"" that is basically a promotion for the Bluray version of ""Enchanted."" The deleted scenes are fun to watch, as is the blooper reel. Neither are very long though. The Carrie Underwood music video for ""Ever Ever After"" is also included.I am sure (or at least I hope) there will be a 2-disc special edition in the near future. So, for this 2008 Widescreen edition, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the lack of extras. The movie itself still packs a wallop!",N/A

1136526,"Where do I begin?  For one the summary for this movie is a lie, DMX is not a drug dealer called the dog calling the shots, he is in the movie for about 2 minutes and has no interaction with the characters, he is some odd narrator that say some non sensible quips from time to time.  The acting is perhaps the worst I have ever seen.  The story, where do I begin I could not understand what this movie was about one minute you got guys shooting each other, and then cops getting shot.  Then you got cops talking to the guy who everyone knows shot a cop as if nothing like that happened.  Then it jumps around and then you got preaching about how because these killing are in Black neighborhoods no one cares.  Then you got Lou Diamond Phillips overacting and then he is having an affair and then more people are getting shot and then you got renegade cops and then you got guys that visit their moms (oh how nice)and you got cops cheating on their wives and cops having threesomes and some drug dealer called the dominican and so on and so on. With my rambling run on sentence I probably do more justice to sum up the story than this movie does.  There is also some hypocritical message in the end stating that the New Orleans murder rate is high, then the very next message is something about honoring the fallen soldiers or warriors or something like.  Now I'm assuming that by fallen soldiers or warriors, theyre talking about the degenerates drug dealers and gang members that are getting killed in this violence, now call me reasonable (I know the writer and director would never understand this) but isn't saying the violence is too high and then saying the guys who got killed were heroes even though there they same type of people perpetrating the violence is kind of hypocritic.  I mean the whole movie is about gang members or drug dealer killing each other (I think, I really don't know what the movie was about), but that's okay because theyre warriors, but the killing is bad.",Death Toll

129795,"As the title so prominently mentions, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE was originally intended to be the last of the Indiana Jones film series.  The movie is an origins story and fills in many of the questions that fans had about the character, e.g. where did Indy get his scar, where did he get his whip, why is he afraid of snakes, etc.The extended opening of the film begins in Utah where Indy (played by River Phoenix here) and his Boy Scout troop are out for a day of riding and exploring.  Indy and a fellow Scout separate from the group and stumble upon a group of men who have just discovered the Cross of Coronado.  Indy believes the object belongs in a museum, while the men just want the fortune the find will bring.  Indy steals the cross and the diggers chase after him.  It's a race through the rough terrain that climaxes aboard a circus train.After explaining some of Indy's origins, the film fast forwards to 1938.  Indy (now once again played by Harrison Ford) is hired by a wealthy ""collector of antiquities"" to find the missing pieces of a map that reveal the resting place of the Holy Grail.  He learns that is father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) has already gone missing in the quest.  In order to find his father, Indy takes the quest.  The journey takes Indy from Italy, Austria, and the Middle East.  The Nazis are once again the villains and are intent on adding another spiritual artifact to their growing collection as preparation for their attempt of world domination.Out of all the Indiana Jones films, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is my favorite. The film has some wonderful acting, particularly by River Phoenix in the opening segment and by Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in the rest of the picture.  Ford and Connery have a great rapport between each other and their relationship grounds the picture in reality.  The movie is chock-full of action.  I also like how the film brought back the characters of Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott).  There is some criticism of the character of Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), but the beautiful and conflicted Schneider makes a perfect female foil for Indy in the movie.INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is sometimes criticized for being less realistic in its action sequences than the two previous films and having too much physical comedy.  The movie is lighter in tone than the previous two films in the franchise, but that doesn't make it any less realistic nor does it overshadow the serious journey that Indy, his father, and their companions are on.  Continuing a theme that was hinted at in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is a film that despite the action and humor is really about renewal and redemption.  It's a movie that when the final credits roll at the end a person can sit back and really feel like they have found ""illumination.""",N/A

1060193,"There's so many things I like about this DVD. I like that the instruction is separate, so you can just focus on the workout. To me, that saves a lot of time because you don't have to slow down for each change (and after you've seen a DVD 3 or 4 times, that becomes annoying).The pace is definitely fast. I would rate it at intermediate rather than advanced because it's low-impact. I'm not in the best of shape myself, but I've found that if you need to slow down, you can just step-touch until you're ready to jump back in.The music has an authentic sound (versus the classic canned-and-bland aerobic studio tracks) with a heavy drumbeat that's easy to follow. I like the enthusiasm of Lisa and her dancers, but I'll agree with other reviewers that you have to stay focused and concentrate in order to keep up.If you're in reasonably good aerobic shape, can focus well for longer periods of time (say, 20 minutes versus 10), and can follow dance steps without getting too lost, you'll enjoy this DVD. This is NOT for you if you're very out of shape and haven't exercised in a long while, if you like a mellow workout where you can 'zone out' a bit from time to time, or if you find dancing a bit challenging to begin with.All in all, a new favorite of mine.",Dance with Lisa: 5 Day Latin Dance System
1159103,"Taken from the Tony Award winning play, Ron Howard's adaptation of ""Frost/Nixon"" is a lot better than I thought it would be. First and most importantly, he had the courage to keep the two main actors, Frank Langella as President Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen as Talk Show host David Frost. He then surrounds them with stellar support (Kevin Bacon, Oliver Pratt, Sam Rockwell) who give iron to their roles as adversaries on either side of the debate. ""Frost/Nixon"" succeeds primarily on the shoulders of these performers, and given the lack of ""star wattage,"" that's a pretty good trick.It's interesting to compare this with the season's other wide-political drama, Oliver Stone's flatW. While both movies have a struggle in that they must present two reviled political figures in a human sense, ""Frost/Nixon"" never lets you forget that the antagonist here really was a nasty piece of work even as it humanizes him. While Stone made GWB into an empty shell, Howard lets Nixon growl about his legacy, his hatred of the press and bitterness toward what he sees as a political lynching; Nixon agrees to the interviews because he thinks he can cakewalk the lightweight Frost and because he can milk Frost's wallet.""Frost/Nixon"" thus plays out like a political cat and mouse thriller. As Frost comes to the realization that Nixon is both taking advantage of him and potentially destroying his project/career, he undertands that he has to rely on more than his charm and wit. Nixon as much as calls Frost his ""worthy adversary"" in a duel, and as Frost comes to terms with the fact that his subject is a master cutthroat where it comes to his game, the final act of ""Frost/Nixon"" kicks into high gear. Given the allegorical nature of the film and its historical content (Nixon left these episodes on his slide to political oblivion, Frost saw his career resurge: now think Katie Couric and Sarah Palin), it's unlikely that we'll ever see this sort of political jousting again.

Toph is lovably deadpan and adorable to boot, and watching her train Aang to earthbend must be seen to be believed.Another thing I love about this show is that I care about the characters so much that I cry for them (not something that happens much with me). An example: in ""Tales of Ba Sing Se"", Iroh mourns his son Lu Ten with the touching ballad ""Little Soldier Boy"". We don't even get to meet Lu Ten (except for a five-second flashback or two) and it still brought tears to my eyes. It's a beautiful moment that will surely ring true to anyone who's lost a family member to war.This season also saw the debut of ""Ozai's Angels"", as they're called among the fandom. We get a new villain: Azula, Zuko's younger sister, and her cronies, Mai and Ty Lee. These three have been sent out by Ozai to capture  Zuko and Iroh, who are considered traitors to the Fire Nation. Azula is a truly awesome and terrifying villainess, obviously taking after her father. She is cold and calculating and reminiscent of early Disney villainesses, particularly Maleficent and Cruella de Vil - but the scary thing is, she's only 14.For action, humor, intelligent plots, beautiful animation and great dialogue, you really can't do much better than Avatar.",Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book Two Collection

586976,"In 2001, David Lynch (director ofDuneand creator ofTwin Peaks) released a complex mystery film that defied the genre rules and mystified audiences. So what's it about?The film starred Naomi Watts, in an outstanding performance, as a seemingly nave and innocent young actress who stumbles upon a car crash victim with amnesia, played by Laura Elena Harring. The two befriend one another and begin to search for clues to the haunted woman's past. Meanwhile a rebellious young director is being told who to recast as the female lead in his next film but when he refuses, strange things begin to happen. Before long their lives cross paths and all who encounter them are affected.The film unfolds into a delirium of complex schemes, startling eroticism and complete insanity. But it keeps its viewers interested, though it never truly explains itself. Many people have attempted to unravel the film's meaning (there are quite a few interesting theories suggested by other reviewers). Some say that it's about the dream of a psychotic woman on the verge of committing suicide. Others say it's an allegory for the corruptive nature of the Hollywood lifestyle. There have even been some who feel that the whole film is just an epic mindf**k, which wouldn't be that surprising coming from an iconoclast like David Lynch. But what is surprising is that most people will admit that they don't fully understand it, and yet they can't get enough of it. Perhaps its popularity can be attributed to the complex plot, or the brilliant acting, or maybe the raw sesuality of Naomi Watts' performance. Whatever the appeal may be, there's no doubt about it, Mulholland Dr. is a provocative, titillating  and mesmerizing trip that you have to experience for yourself. Maybe even more than once.Also recommended:EraserheadBlue VelvetThe Straight Story",Mulholland Drive

876213,"I watched this movie last night.  Why it has been labled a ""gay"" movie is beyond my grasp.  It is simply a story of growing up:  learning to make your own decisions, to make your own way, and to understand that happiness usually is standing right in front of us.The movie's two central characters are Shane and Allen.  I don't agree at all that the gay character (Allen) caused the huge change in Shane. Shane CHANGED HIMSELF.  Like most of us going through life's journey, you have to experience--and hopefully LEARN from that experience--as you continue to grow.  Are you going to make some mistakes?  Sure you are; you're human.  This particular movie dealt more with the intricate bonding of two people:  one just happened to be gay.  So, if you're gay and you think you'll get some T&A; between the two lead characters, forget it.  That is NOT what this movie is about.Directed by David Gleeson, this movie's running time is 89 minutes and the version I watched was not rated.

189164,"Far from perfect. Far from mediocre. I'm very proud to welcome The Dead Hate The Living into the ranks of the ""good zombie movies"". It's not in the same batch with Romero or Fulci, but this one helps bridge the gap between the ""greats"" and the ""downright awful"". I think there has long been a big discrepancy between the two extremes with not a lot of movies falling in that mid-range.The movie revolves around a young director, named David Poe (Eric Clawson), making his first feature film, and it just happens to be about zombies. Oh, the irony of it all! Do you think he planned it that way? Of course he did, the character of David is really based on much of the life of director David Parker. David Poe's sisters and friends round up the cast and crew for the film. They've decided to break in to an abandoned hospital to make their film. And we all know what happens to people in horror films who do anything illegal or immoral...they die. Not to give anything away, but I'm sure we all know that by now. It wouldn't have been so bad had they left the corpse they found alone. And we all know what happens when you use a real corpse as an unpaid cast member in your new movie that you're making. Well, okay, so that one's not as obvious maybe, I've tried to tell you guys this, but I'll repeat it again for those who missed it. Don't mess with dead things! Just don't do it, it will save you all a lot of pain and grief.The Dead Hate the Living was a little slow to take off but once it did, it kept the tension till the end. Don't expect to jump out of your seats during the picture, but expect to get some creepy atmosphere. Parker brings us two of the more intimidating and scary zombies you'll ever see.There was copious amounts of gore, but none of it took away from the story, but rather served to compliment it. I think real horror fans will enjoy this movie because it was directed by a guy who really loves the genre and you can tell. Parker pays homage to many of the greats who have come before him, notably the likes of Carpenter, Fulci, Romero, and Raimi. He also pays homage to great make-up artist and actor Tom Savini and the best S-Mart employee of them all, Bruce Campbell. I challenge you to watch this movie, pay attention to the details, and see how many references to other movies you can find.If this movie had a higher budget they could have done a lot more with it and it could have been really amazing! That said, I think that Parker did a great job with what he had.",N/A
762281,"This movie is a very thoughtful and well made espionage thriller that in the past would fit in with infiltrating Communists or drug gangs , Nazi's or whoever.  The story is a old one  in that regard , as the infiltrator begans to care about the some of the people he is now accepted as part of their organization. Like any undercover person the job is a rough one that takes a terrible toll on the infiltrator. Don Cheadle also gives a near perfect perfomance as the lead character and one can only hope that someday he gets the right role to land him a Oscar.  The supporting cast is excellent as well  and this is a A list movie with A list talent all the way. What makes this story interesting as well is the focus on the decent Muslims who feel that terrorists have hijacked their religion and then fight back against them. Sadly there are too many silent voices in that regard accross the world.  Like most modern movies this movie just shines on blu ray, there isn't a line or smudge in site.  Blu ray equals classy transfers and top notch sound.  So this very well acted terrorist espionage thriller is well worth a watch especially on blu ray.",Traitor

1167898,"""Never Cry Werewolf"" is the very definition of horror lite.  I'm about sick and tired of PG-13 DVD's being advertised as ""unrated"".  Don't get me wrong, this isn't an unwatchable mess of a film that will leave you angry about the 90 minutes of your life you can never get back, but if you watch werewolf movies for gore, nudity, and terror than don't hesitate to pass this by.  This is another intended for the tween crowd.The lead actress is one thing this flick has going for it.  Doe-eyed brunette cutie-pie Nina Dobrev pretty much carries this entire film and she does a pretty solid job at it.  Geek demi-icon Kevin Sorbo (Hercules The Legendary Journeys) is slightly amusing as a celebrity outdoorsman tapped by our heroine to help her take out her new neighbor, who for some reason can turn into a werewolf at will by wrapping a strip of some pervert's neckskin around his knuckles.  Yeeeeaaaah, the werewolf mythology on this one is shaky at best.  Also, he can bite people and apparently turn them into living lycanthropic plastic surgery disasters.  Whatever.  Throw in a pathetic love interest with awful emo hair, an annoying little brother, the creepiest dog this side ofCujo, and a pot of eyeball stew and you've got a lame-but-watchable horror romp that even my two year old son laughed at.  A lot.  There's some blood splatter going on, but very little actual gore unless you count a wolf exploding into translucent goo as gore.  I do not.While ""Never Cry Werewolf"" offers some creeps, a hot protagonist, and a pretty cool werewolf (realistic: no.  Cool: yes.) there is not enough to scratch that horror itch.  There is however, some cannibalism which can only help.  The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good.  But probably half of the scenes are ripped off wholesale from other films.  That is bad.  Couple making out in car hears noise, boy steps out to investigate upon girl's urging.  Gee, I wonder what happens next?  Lameness, that's what.  Telepathic werewolf: why?!?!  Reincarnated lost love?  That's not even a werewolf movie convention, that's eithera mummyor acrummy vampire flick!  Come on!  They even rip offHitchcock, though I imagine a lot of people will think it'sShia Leboufbeing robbed.  I can say that I've genuinely never seen a werewolf take a hostage to use as a human shield to protect himself from the assault of a teenage girl before.  I wish I could still say that.  So much wrong.As bad as this movie is, it is still better thanCursed, and that one had gore.  There is some smirk-worthy humor, a few genuinely creepy bits -most involving that damn dog-, and did I mention the attractiveness of the lead actress?  All-around a watchable movie, but just don't go in thinking you're getting a full-on unrated frightfest.  This is a bare-bones release, but I don't imagine there'd be any special features I'd actually want to watch anyway.  Have a look if you're in a light-hearted mood and have seen every other werewolf movie.  And if you have seen every other werewolf movie; my condolences on having sat through the unspeakably terrible Howling sequels.  Those make this one look likeAn American Werewolf in London.2 1/2 stars, rounded down for false advertising.Again, do not sell a PG-13 DVD with an ""unrated""label!

1062523,"I had never heard of this film until I caught it on tv.  I was at once spellbound.  The subject is people who jump from the Golden Gate Bridge.  It is a very poignant documentary about people who commit suicide off this grand structure and the effect their deaths have on the ones left behind.  Be forewarned.  This film documents 23 of the known 24 suicides in year 2004.  Some one called this a snuff film and I admit it has the shocking effect of a snuff film but I am convinced beyond a doubt that it was not Eric Steel's intention to create a snuff film when he made this movie.  With camera's strategically placed, Eric and his staff documented suicides in progress.  Some successful, some rescued.  His staff often intervened to try and rescue the jumpers before they jumped.It is a disturbing film and it is also heart wrenching.  There are in depth interviews with some of the friends and family left behind.  Those left behind are always so stunned.  Even if they had an inkling of the suicide's intention, they are always shocked, stunned, full of guilt.  A co-worker of mine committed suicide in 2000 and I remember feeling all those emotions.  Those emotions rocked me to the core and her suicide haunted me for years.  I was left wondering, why didn't she say something?  She was always smiling!  Then last year my ex-husband's favorite brother committed suicide and again I felt those over-powering emotions of shock and surprise.Seeing this movie literally horrified me that people can be so severely depressed and insomnia-ridden that they choose to die rather than live.  It's like they don't realize that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.I cannot understand why this bridge does not have a suicide barrier.  Yes the politician's arguments may seem valid, but when people are easily climbing over a bridge's 4 foot barrier and jumping to their deaths, it's obvious something HAS to be done.I would recommend this movie if for it's educational purpose alone.  No one can watch this documentary and not be moved.",The Bridge
221495,"This is surely one of the finer American films to explore the tensions between business, morality, success, idealism, and manhood set amid the backdrop of the moral and ethical conflicts raging in America in the early 70s.Harry Stoner, a WWII hero who helped liberate Italy at Enzio Beach, is an upwardly mobile garment manufacturer living the ""American dream.""  Yet appearances are deceiving.  His relationship with his wife is strained, his business is overextended and failing, and his reality is increasingly fractured by memories of his dead war buddies, the 1939 lineup of his treasured Dodgers, and glimpses of his idealistic youth, particularly his years playing baseball, drumming with a big band and listening to swing music.The counterculture and the decaying values of Vietnam-era America meet Harry Stoner's sliding immorality head-on, as Harry is faced continually with business decisions that weaken him morally and challenge him ethically, until his fragile efforts at holding it all together rip apart at the seams.Not only is Lemmon extraordinary, so is the supporting cast, including Jack Gilford as his business partner and moral counterweight and sweet Laurie Heineman as a hippie with a heart of gold.  The settings in Los Angeles, such as the garment district, Chinatown, Beverly Hills, and Malibu are exquisitely captured by John Avildsen.You'd have to fast-forward to Woody Allen's masterful Crimes and Misdemeanors to see as finely a tuned exploration of the pressures on a morally conflicted American businessman as delivered here.BTW, the new release (with commentary) adds dimension and weight to an already substantial film.

1119328,"""He's a real Nightmare ManWearing a mask that's AfricanToo bad that his killing plansscare nobody.""First off, a general warning regarding this year's crop of Horrorfest films on DVD.  They all have the same menus, which consist of the viewer driving in to a drive-in.  Then the menu options come up on the movie screen along with snippets from the movie.  I have not been paying attention to these, because I push play at the earliest opportunity, but while putting away my popcorn after watching the film I noticed that these snippets really give away too much of the film.  You might say that in this case that is not a bad thing, but on general principle you should avoid such spoilers, especially if you have managed to make it to that point without knowing anything about the film besides the title.""Nightmare Man"" is what I would categorize as a drunken frat boy film.  By that appellation I mean that it is not intended for the aficionado of horror films, but for those who like to leer at scantily dressed women and laugh at the blood and gore.  That is not to suggest that this is not a desirable demographic if you want to make money off of a horror film, but that I never filled out an application.  However, that constitutes a line of demarcation that will dictate your response to this film, as evidenced by the other reviews for this 2006 film.  If you do not like tongue-in-cheek horror films or think that this one walks too fine of a line in that regard, then you are not going to like this one and you should know that from the start.  Still, the cast is decent and the women all act sexy rather than just look sexy, which is why the aforementioned drunken frat boys will love this film.Ellen Morris (Blythe Metz) and her husband William (Luciano Szafir) are trying to conceive a child, so she orders a fertility mask that turns out to be to creepy.  The next thing we know Bill is driving Ellen to a mental hospital because she insists she has been attacked by the ""Nightmare Man.""  Then the car runs out of gas and Ellen is left alone.  For a while wirter-driector Rolfe Kanefsky (maker of such unrated driected to video fare as ""The Erotic Misadventures of the Invisible Man"", ""Jacqueline Hyde"") is covering the same ground as last year's Horrorfest entry ""Penny Dreadful,"" as the Nightmare man shows up and tries to kill Ellen.  But in fleeing from the killer Ellen stumbles upon a cabin in which two couples, Mia (Tiffany Shepis) & Ed (Jack Sway) and Trinity (Hanna Putnam) & Jack (James Ferris), are  engaging in their own version of couples therapy.  Now we know that Ellen will not just be the appetizer on this mania's menu and the killing can begin in earnest.  The problem is when we get to the final act and the film reverses engines full from tongue-in-cheek to a scene that many viewers might find disturbing (if not offensive).  I was giving the film the benefit of the doubt to that point, but I had to round down because I thought it was way too late to try and have it both ways in this movie.As you watch this film the identity of the Nightmare Man is so obvious that it becomes too obvious, which makes you question what is really going on.  There does indeed turn out to be a twist, but then the twist gets reversed and the movie gets derailed.  Viewers not in the drunken frat boy category are going to be rolling their eyes at this point and inquire as the cognitive processes of the director.  Otherwise, this is a film that wants to have its sex and violence too, represented by the cutting back and forth between Ellen being attacked in the woods and the game of Truth or Dare being played in the cabin.  Then there is the way sex (that is to say, nudity) are used to set up the first death, even before the victim says their ironic last words.  But for me the burning question is this: I understand that anybody can pick up a knife and figure out what to do with it, but how many people could pick up a bow and arrow they find in the woods and start shooting rapid fire bullseyes?  (Amazing what you will focus on as being unbelievable in a horror film, huh?).This is one of only three Horrorfest DVDs this time around that actual have bonus features beyond the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes, which speaks more to Kanfesky and Shepis being old hands in the horror genre than anything else.  There is a ""Flubbing a Nightmare"" gag reel that is pretty lame, some extended scenes that show nothing important was left on the cutting room floor (but do give you another chance to see Shepis's strip tease and Putnam's fake orgasm), and a stills gallery.  ""Creating a Nightmare"" is the standard ""making of"" featurette and then we get ""Tiffany's Behind the Scenes"" bit (actually introduced as ""Tiffany's Behind........the Scenes""), which is pretty much what you would expect if you give Tiffany Shepis a video camera during the film's down time.  Shepis, Kanfesky and producer Esther Goodstein laugh their way through the commentary track.

24372,"Some films do get better with repeated viewings. Akira Kurosawa's 1954 black and white film Seven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai) is one of them. It was well deserving of winning the 1954 Venice Film Festival's Silver Lion, as well as the two Academy awards it won for Best Art/Set Decoration and Best Costume Design. On a first view it's simply a great action film, but with subsequent viewings the finer points of characterization come through in each moment, seeping into the mind subliminally and purposefully. The story, at nearly three and a half hours in length- including a five minute intermission, is never weighted down with fat, as all of the many subplots bear fruit- so unlike most films made in Hollywood today. It became an international sensation, and the highest grossing Japanese film of its day.Yes, there are remnants of the stale samurai genre, such as the wise man Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura), and the `boy on the verge of manhood' in Katsushiro Okamoto (Isao `Ko' Kimura), and his romance with farmer Manzo's daughter Shino, but the central human dilemma of the 16th Century farmers who are helpless against the depredations of the bandits, who abound during the civil wars of the era, raises the film above mere clich&eacute;s. We only see the bandits at the beginning and end of the film. There are about two hours where the meat of the tale takes place, and not a bandit is in sight. How many films do away with their bad guys for so long? How many could afford to? Since we do not know any of the bandits' names, they are more like a singular character, or a sheer force of nature. Why do they keep coming to attack the villagers, even as their forces are successively thinned with each failed raid? They must realize that the once helpless villagers have hired defenders? There is no Darth Vader among the bandits, despite George Lucas's latter-day attempts to cite this film as an influence for his banal and downright puerile Star Wars saga. We also learn that the villagers are neither as poor nor innocent as they portray. There are murderers amongst them, who have killed samurai before. They also seek to lowball and underpay their protectors.... It is a truism that almost all great directors have at least one great collaborator. With Ingmar Bergman it was his cinematographer Sven Nykvist. With Federico Fellini it was his musical scorer, Nino Rota. But with Kurosawa it's not only great stars like Mifune and Shimura, but his co-writers, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni- part of a rotating staff of writers that muted some of Kurosawa's own admitted over the top tendencies in storytelling, and brought the tale down to a human level. Without them the film may have been little more than a greatly stylized genre film, rather than a great film, period.The cinematography Asakazu Nakai, and score by Fumio Hayasaka are also very good, although this is an actor-driven vehicle. Nakai's deep focus techniques- at the time cutting edge, are every bit as good as those in Citizen Kane. Especially, look at the complexity of the many crowd scenes, where many little stories play out as we watch the foregrounded action of the samurai. Things like this are only gotten on repeated viewings, and with my second viewing I picked up much more than on a first glance, especially while not having to read the subtitles. And look at how jungle twigs seem to leap out at the viewer, as does Mifune's huge phallic sword as he slings it over his shoulder. The whole film was shot in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, so one wonders what Kurosawa would have done with this film in widescreen.There's no doubt that Seven Samurai is a great film, and with its length and complexity it will only grow in my estimation as I view it more and more over the years. Of that I'm sure. But, that said, I do not think that it is Kurosawa's best film. I'd still lean toward Ikiru for that honor- for it's simply the more deeply human tale, and Shimura is even better in his role as Watanabe the doomed bureaucrat than as Kambei the indefatigable warrior. However, this is the granddaddy of all great action films, from Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch to even James Cameron's films like Aliens or The Terminator series, as well as a great bildungsroman for Katsushiro. It also struck me, as the film opens to drumbeats, how reminiscent this film's opening is to that of my beloved Godzilla- a film that was released in the same year, with the footfalls of the monster dominating a black screen filled with credits. While Godzilla is nowhere in a league to Seven Samurai as a film, it is the second most influential Japanese film of all time. That both rely on such primal sounds in their openings makes one wonder if there's a connection.Yet, the thing that Seven Samurai has that few other films do is its incredibly detailed richness. From the bad skull caps the male characters wear, to the ambush tests Kambei devises to recruit his cohorts, to the old woman who goes to kill a hobbled bandit with a farm instrument- to avenge her son's death, and many others; all of these and more make repeated viewing a necessity to truly appreciate this film, for all of these things are non-essential to the basic plot, even as they heighten the realism of this unreal tale. Let me end by stating that Seven Samurai is every bit as good, and great, as its greatest champions claim, and I ask you, how rare a thing is that?",N/A
687447,"Jean Arliss is a gal with some major psychological baggage(like a lot of the chicks I've dated).  She has a habit of stabbing people to death, vandalizing flower shops, being a straight up b*$!h, and other assorted mischief.  She's been brought to America by her husband, Warren and is taking care of an invalid mute woman at their home.  Warren's half sister is thrown into the mix as well, and pretty soon what we got here is a mystery involving murder, family and inheritance.  William Castle decided to take a break from ghosties and monsters and take a....ahem....stab at Alfred Hitchcock/Robert Bloch kind of material.  I must say he does a very good job, better than you think he would with this kind of material.  Even his little campy introduction and the famous ""fright break"" doesn't hurt any of the mystery or suspense of the film, but simply reminds you you're watching a William Castle film.  It's extremely derivative of ""Psycho"", but nobody seems to complain about this because it's so blatantly obvious that that's what Castle is doing, and he makes no attempts to hide it, but rather winks at the audience about it.  It's not a spoof though, nor is it really campy(only the intro and the ""fright break""), it's actually a good movie.  Some people actually like it more than Psycho(as shown in the featurette).  I don't know if I'd go that far, but it is a damn good movie.",Homicidal

I saw the film and was knocked by it. The plot with its twists and turns, and throughout the film, the clues are there, as to what might or not might happen. Rebecca Romijn is gorgeous (I read that that Uma Thurman was mentioned for the role), but Romijn is more sexy in the part of Laura Ash. In my opinion Thurman isn't even attractive.

778635,"If you are at all like I am and find that many Western films are simply not doing it for you, might I suggest a Russian film subtitled in three different languages?????It is a good thing (not Martha Stewart-like!) to have Amazon friends with which to watch, learn, observe and share.  I watched this film ""The Cuckoo"" (KUKUSHKA) by famed director Alexander Rogozskin with one friend who said to me ""You really need to see this film.  I can't think of anything like it that I have ever seen!""  WHY NOT!  So we did, and he was right!I speak only for myself when I say that this film has to be one of the most pleasantly odd (if that would be the best word to use) movies that I have ever seen.  This film tells three very separate stories, in three different languages and cultural understandings, with three unique characters who, because of World War 2 are all thrown together in a place and time and must communicate.  Shot on location in the upper regions of Asia, the story of a Finnish sniper, a disgraced Russian Captain and a native Lapp woman comes vividly, comically and tragically to life as Rogozhkin spins a tale of how humanity rises above war and death, how compassion transcends language, and how basically alike we all are as human beings.  These three ""misfits"" all desire love, sex, touch, beauty, peace and tranquility.  This is what each of them had before the War ""enlisted"" them involuntarily away from what they once knew.  War has made them resourceful in ways they probably could have never learned otherwise, but the War has become tiresome and they long, no yearn for sweet humanity once again.  What is fascinating about this film (yes you must be prepared to read subtitles!) is that each character speaks a different tongue, and you must remember that what you are reading is the character's true thoughts and not what the other character is understanding!  Once you get that point, the rest is cake!  This film was a challenge that I was up to, and I am glad that I accepted it.  When Western films are not filling the void that I so feel, I find myself turning to the East and longing for a way to view life that is not American.  This is an incredible humanitarian film that is beautifully and ingeniously rendered.  In the ""special featurette"", director Rogozhkin and members of his team make it very clear that this film could actually border ""on Boredom"" because of the solitary way in which the tale needed to be shot and told.  I never was bored.  I was transfixed and grateful that once again I had experienced something that I otherwise might have overlooked.",The Cuckoo
1063924,"""The Big Cube"" stars screen glamour queen Lana Turner. Although not her last film, she was past her days as a box office star and had already begun accepting a few low-quality roles. This one is slightly-less laughable than ""Trog."" Lana plays Adriana Roman, an actress who has retired to marry wealthy Charles Winthrop (Dan O'Herlihy). Charles also has beautiful daughter, Lisa (Karin Mossberg), who inexplicably speaks with a Swedish accent. Lisa has unknowingly fallen in with a bad crowd that party and use LSD; the ringleader, Johnny (George Chakiris), sees Lisa as his new bankroll and begins to romance her. When Adriana & Charles have an accident at sea, the widowed Adriana is left as the one who must decide whether Lisa gets her inheritance or not. Since Lisa has chosen to be with a druggie, Adriana turns her down. Johnny attempts to gaslight Adriana with LSD. You'll have to watch to find out the chilling conclusion! So much is laughable here, but Lana is a trooper and does the best that she can with this campy story and poor script. Lana still looks lovely, even though she is weighted down in some pretty gaudy gowns by famous designer Travilla and some hairpieces that would be enough to give most women head trauma! Even more amazing on the hairpieces is that they don't even come close to matching the color of Lana's hair. I kept wondering if this was intentional or some new two-toned hair fad of the 60's that I'd never heard about. It is amazing what a solid cast this movie has, too; Oscar winner Chakiris (""West Side Story""), Oscar nominated Turner, Richard Egan, and Dan O'Herlihy (who had played Turner's love interest in ""Imitation of Life""). Apparently the majority of the budget went to the stars' salaries and not the script. And let's not forget Pamela Rodgers as Bibi, the bimbo fun-loving friend of Lisa. Pamela went on to bigger fame in the hit TV series ""Laugh-In."" The psychedelic effects are fab, too, and there's plenty of drugs, sex (well, as much as is allowed in 1968), and rock & roll music (or something like it) to make this one the hit of a trashy movie party! A theatrical trailer is also included. I suggest getting the ""Women in Peril"" box set that also includes ""Trog"" (Joan Crawford) and ""Caged"" (Eleanor Parker); it averages out to about $9 a movie...what a value!",The Big Cube
1135480,"Now this is what I would term as wonderfully twisted.  I didn't really know what I was getting into with this one.  I kind of skimmed some reviews here and there and looked at the high ratings.  While this isn't the greatest Anime I've ever seen, I still thought it was pretty enjoyable.  It's actually very well done in many aspects and people should be warned that this is definitely meant only for adults.  Nevermind the harsh language or violence, the sexual concepts and content are definitely geared towards an adult audience.  Also probably one of the reasons I've enjoyed watching this because it's a more twisted facet than I've stumbled across before.  Now this isn't overly lewd, in my opinion, it's actually fairly tasteful and there really isn't any full blown nudity or sexual scenes.  Thus this is not even remotely close to a Hentai, this deals more with concepts of desire and how that motivates a character.The story revolves around a photographer, Saiga, who sort of falls into something akin to destiny.  There's a secret club rumored to exist where a lot of political officials from Japan are said to visit and partake of their excesses.  At this point we can probably say we see some ""Eyes Wide Shut"" influence, but that's really where things begin and end for that.  No one's ever seen this club and no one knows who belongs to it.  Saiga is determined to find out what goes on there.  He follows a suspected member and makes it inside safely.  There he sees all kinds of sexual excesses taking place, some violent, some simply disgusting to behold!  The worst comes with a main event involving someone they term as ""the goddess"".  She's the daughter of the head of the most powerful company in Japan and she's only in her early teens, which is probably the most shocking fact.  There's something strange about her and Saiga immediately starts taking photographs, this was not a smart move because it made him a dead give away to the patrons that he didn't belong.  This is where we meet the story's main antagonist, Suitengo, who swiftly sentences him to death for intruding into their club.  Something strange happens though, the Goddess walks up to Saiga and kisses him; this was originally meant for another patron.  That patron is incensed with rage and insists on killing Saiga himself.  However, something is changing inside Saiga.  He does the only thing he knows how to do as the man is about to kill him, he takes his picture.  There's a huge explosion and half the man disappears in a spray of blood.  Saiga has turned into a Euphoric, something we find out later.  This is how the show kicks off.  Intrigued yet?  I sure was, but I'm going to leave that quick introduction there and let you simply watch the rest for yourself.In terms of the main characters I thought this show expertly developed them.  The cast is actually fairly big, but it never fell to the problems Rahxephon had.  It also didn't fall prey to some other common elements in Anime I've come across, in the sense that the writers didn't feel the need to have a battle every episode.  Instead we do have episodes of pure character development and the conflict is in the drama.  This is simply just great writing in my opinion.  I realized after the fact that this show did exactly what I wish a lot of other shows would do in terms of story format.  They have a handful of adversary creatures that are also Euphorics, I suppose you can term them Boss Battles (to borrow a term from video games) and each one has their own special powers.  Some of the Euphorics have strange powers that can cause them to change shape into something hideous, not all are like Saiga's where he mostly stays as he is.Saiga's main goal in this series is to save the Goddess (Kagura is her real name).  He attempts to do this literally against all odds.  He's fighting not only a giant corporation with limitless wealth, but also fighting against the government.  It's as if no place is safe!  Hiding from these people is nearly impossible, but he's up to the challenge.  All amidst this is the background story of relationship building and concepts of love.  This is a natural aspect since it's a highly sexualized series.  I found it interesting to note that almost every character has some kink or fetish, even Saiga has one.  I think the show was trying to subtly get across that fetishism is okay, but when it goes to extreme excess it becomes a dangerous element in a person's life.My favorite character in this was Suitengo.  I usually like the bad guys in most shows, but Suitengo is one of the best, by far.  He doesn't act like the other estranged Euphorics that are in existence due to their extreme greed or lusts.  He's calm, cool, and very collected.  He never really goes out of control and I thought that was great.  He has a very defined agenda and sticks to his plan.  This might be a bit of a spoiler, but I simply have to mention it because it was one of my favorite aspects.  This is, so far, the only thing I've seen that both the bad guy actually wins and there is also a happy ending.  I know that sounds very strange, but it happens.  It's so well written that it's just great and made me love it all the more.I would definitely recommend watching this once, at the very least.  I think it is very well written and my only thing I might say is it doesn't have a ton of re-watch value for me.  I liked the world that was created and the concepts touched upon, but shows like this aren't something I really fiend for.  I enjoy them while I watch them, but it's not something I'm going to pull out and tell my friends they have to see it right away.  That's really the only reason I dropped a star off of this.  Other than that, this is very well done and I definitely recommend it.  The DVD box set is beautifully packaged in a gatefold format with slipcase and it also includes the bonus of six booklets that give you character outlines and rare sketches.  I think it's a worthwhile set to own and I could definitely see myself watching it again at some point.",Speed Grapher

I can relatemore to the later chapters of this comedy-drama as the highly priviledgedpeople in it move from middle age to old age as most of us do.I remember a quotation from 1972, which Bill Moyers quoted back then:""We have gone from Youth to Decadence without an intervening Golden Age.""I think this quotation summarizes the experiences of the characters here.They experience life just after The Great War in the 1920's with almost everything in life in front of them.  Then they experience the vagariesof experiences after youth and are not really encouraged by the passageof time.  There is really no Golden Age for any of them from the 1930'sto the 1970's, and many of them do not survive that far.I feel a note of sadness in the end as nearly everyone in the story isdead and I wonder, ""What was all this for?""The cast is excellent, but the story is hard to follow at times.However, I am glad I discovered this series ten years after it was televised.

316178,"While the film THE MAMBO KINGS is not as detailed or insightful as Oscar Hijuelos's novel THE MAMBO KINGS PLAY SONGS OF LOVE which won the 1990 Pulitzer prize it is still an excellent entertaining film.  The most striking feature of the movie is how well it makes 1950's Cuban American life in upper Manhattan live again complete with wonderful mambo and other Latin music of the period and even a visit from Desi Arnaz (played by his son with amazing accuracy).The two Mambo kings are the Castillo brothers - Cesar and Nestor - musicians who fled Havana after a bloody dispute with a nightclub owner.  Cesar is the ambitious older brother played perfectly by Armand Assante.  Assante magically captures Cesar's sleazy good looks and coarse confident charisma.  As one character in the film says of Cesar ""He thinks he is the last Coca Cola in the desert.""  Nestor is played with surprising sensitivity by Antonio Banderos and he is the song writer and trumpet player for the Mambo Kings.  Nestor longs for Cuba and the girl he left there, Maria, though he also rather touchingly constantly reads a book entitled FORWARD AMERICA apparently written by one of the Vanderbilts.  Both men find significant others in the US with an American blond bombshell who sells cigarettes in one of the clubs becoming Cesar's best girl while Nestor eventually marries another Cuban immigrant, the shy but beautiful Delores, who aspires to be a teacher.The boys have some early success in New York but mostly because of Cesar's temper and pride fall on hard times and are reduced to working as butchers by day and playing for Bar Mitzvahs, weddings and strippers by night.  Eventually they get a break from Desi Arnaz who lets them play on his hit TV show I LOVE LUCY.  In a fun bit Assante, Bandearas and Arnaz Jr. are inter-cut with footage with Lucille Ball from the original classic show.  But lasting happiness and success are not in the cards for the brothers.MAMBO KINGS is an important film as it preserves the dance, music and culture of the Latin communities in NYC in the 50's.  Legendary Tito Puente appears as himself and salsa queen Celia Cruz plays an interesting character on the mambo scene and demonstrates her singing and dancing talents and both add to the authenticity of the film.

1143291,"Atonement is such a beautifully shot movie. Every scene was filmed perfectly and Keira Knightley must be one of the most beautiful actresses in the past decade to act on screen. (Even though someone should make her eat a hamburger or two because she is very skinny) I also read the book by Ian McEwan and I must say the interpretation to screen was very well done.This is a very tragic love story because of what someone thinks they see and their actions that set into motion events that will destroy three lives. I also feel that this was very much a fairy tale. We have beautiful princess in love with her beautiful prince and the evil villainess who separates them forever. But the villainess finds redemption and realizes the horrors of what she had done and looks to atone for her sins.The tragedy is all because of what a thirteen year old girl thinks she sees. Briony has a very active imagination. She loves to write plays and stories and sees the world in a very different way from those around her. It is the summer of 1935 in England, right before World War II. This should be a carefree summer of swimming, playing and enjoying life. Briony has an older sister, Cecilia (Keira) who acts quite worldly. Briony looks up to her older sister and Cecilia treats Briony as any older sister would with their annoying younger sister. Then there is the housekeeper's son Robbie (James McAvoy) Briony has a crush on Robbie. Robbie humors Briony. Robbie wants Cecilia. Cecilia, even though she acts cold to Robbie, wants him as much as he wants her.As Briony watches from her bedroom window, she sees a confrontation between Robbie and Cecilia and assumes something is wrong. As we find out what she thinks she sees is misconstrued. This starts the ball rolling. Robbie has been invited to dinner by Briony and Cecilia's brother. We see him typing away at his typewriter trying to come up with a note to apologize to Cecilia. He decides to have a little fun and types a very sexual graphic and bunt note about what he would like to do to Cecilia. He doesn't think it will ever be read by anyone and instead writes a more formal note. BUT, by accident Robbie takes the graphic note and hands it to Briony to give to Cecilia. OOOPS!! Briony reads it (even though I can't understand how at her age she knows what one of the words means) and thinks Robbie is a sex fiend. But she still gives the note to Cecilia who is very intrigued by his blunt words.Poor Robbie thinks his goose is cooked and when he knocks on the door, Cecilia answers. They both come to an agreement about how they feel for each other in a darkened library. And do they ever- the best scene in the whole movie! Briony comes across them and is shocked by what she sees. This is the final third strike against Robbie and Cecilia. As the night goes on a horrible thing happens to Briony's older cousin Lola and Briony is right there to blame Robbie.Because of Briony's lies and confusion, she destroys any chance at happiness Robbie and Cecilia can have together. Briony's life is also ruined as you will come to see. Four years go by, Robbie is off fighting in France, Cecilia is a nurse separated from her family and Briony wants to make amends, but can't. There is tragedy on all ends and these three people will never be carefree or happy ever again. To the very end Briony is the one who tells this tale and you will be crying over her pain and suffering and that of her sister and her young lover, who only had a small moment together in that dark library against the shelves.Katiebabs",N/A

1133365,"I have rated this DVD four stars because it is a film and not a live performance. Yes, the singers' attention to lipsynching is good (as good as the performance of Ariadne auf Naxos)but the performance still lacks the effectiveness that only a live performance has. It is also on two discs which is unnecessary--afterall DGG (a Universal Company) released their Arabella on one disc.Initially I was reluctant to consider this performance. Solti's recording was the first complete (true an earlier one from Salzburg was released in the 90's) recording. Starring Della Casa, Gueden and George London it should have perfection. Alas Solti's brutal handling of the music and his rigidity effectively destroyed the beauty of the score. Later a DGG live performance conducted by Keilbert with Della Casa and Fischer Dieskau was released. Keilbert obviously loved the score but by then Della Casa could no longer sustain long phrases without great effort. Fischer Dieskau was never a ""natural"" Mandryka but he was so musical that he could compensate artistically for what he lacked vocally. Te Kanawa's recording was scuppered by a dreadful Zdenka and an undistinguished Mandryka.But onto the DVDs. It is interesting to compare the DGG release with the Decca, notably for the ""secondary roles. DGG gives us Donald McIntyre and Helga Dernesch, a Wotan and a Brunhilde-Isolde cum Klytemnesta. The Decca counterparts are second tier singers at the State Opera, never less than competent, but hardly in the same class. Decca does manage to give a Card Dealer whose career ranged from Brunhilde to Fidelio, but Modl is close to voiceless but fortunately the role is in the conversational mode so that what we have is a ""name"" but not necessarily a ""voice"". The Met's Fortune Teller is drawn from its comprimarios who can sing the notes rather than intone them as Modl does.But what of the leads? Kanawa at fifty but certainly not looking it is giving the performance of her life. She can be responsive to the text and is much more than a stand and deliver singer. She is reported to have said that she found German somewhat daunting but that hasn't stopped her from singing the Marschallin and the Countess in Capriccio. Surprisingly Janowitz isn't much more intelligible. In the conversational passages she articulates the text more clearly, but in the more lyrical passages she is content to let the voice do its thing. In a British Magazine, International Opera Collector (alas no longer around) she was interviewed by J. B. Stean. She told Stean that she did not like live performances, too many things could go wrong. Well, I only saw her once, in Ariadne, at the Vienna State Opera and it was glorious, far more effective than her highly regarded recording. More alive, more spontaneous, more communicative and singing quite beautifully. She has two bootleg recordings of Rosenkavalier. The one I have dates from 1978 at the Salzburg festival: it was truly a gala affair with Popp, Minton, Moll, Pavarotti, and conducted by von Dohnanyi. Since she never sang this in the studio it is a must have for Straussians and since this is live it possesses all the aforementioned virtues. Her Eva in what surely is one of the best Meistersingers also ranks high for all the same reasons. No, Gundula, you should have let your heart speak when you were asked to do both the Ariadne and the Arabella. For all your virtues (and they are plenty) my heart does go to Kiri, simply because she was willing to take the chance and triumph.For Mandryka, the choice between Brendl and Weikl is difficult, both are superb singing actors (interestingly enough I have both of them as Hans SAchs and I could never choose one over the other)both are in sovereign voice and both bring a lot to the party. Weikl may be slightly younger, but this could never be a factor in making a choice. Zdenka if a thankless role, except for joining her sister in the glorious first act duet much of her music is not grateful; I can understand why Della Casa who sang the role in 1948 was only too eager to assume the mantle of Arabella. Ghazarian may make creamier sounds (afterall Vienna is her home base) but short of committing the sins of Gabriela Fontana (Kiri's sister in the CD) and neither are guilty of that, I suppose the slight edge would have to go to the Decca DVD.Solti has clearly had some second thoughts on this score. He is more relaxed and more willing to let his singers ""have their way"" with some of the most beautiful phrases in the opera. A more natural Strauss conductor, Thielemann, is probably not going to be able to document his career in the way that Solti has, the classical business being what it is. A pity, since there will probably be not Frosch, not to mention, a Ring, but then we really don't have the singers for Siegfried and Brunhilde or Wotan.For many the choice may be made easily since Decca has the Vienna Philharmonic, but never sell the Met orchestra short even if it hasn't had the history of the older institution. It supplies all the same ingredients under Thielemann. I have both, and I suspect that I will return to Kiri, but always glad to know that Gundula is available.",Strauss: Arabella

1139294,"Films based off video games are usually not that wonderful.  They either range from good (""Resident Evil,"" ""Silent Hill"") to mediocre (""Doom,"" ""Tomb Raider"") to awful (""House of the Dead,"" ""Bloodrayne"").  Director Xavier Gens' ""Hitman"" falls somewhere in between good and mediocre.  It's got solid action scenes and a great look, but not much direction or cohesion when it comes to the storyline.Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) was trained as a young boy by the Organization to kill when needed.  In Eastern Europe, he's hired to assassinate the Russian president, which he does successfully, only to see him reappear on the television with only a minor wound on his head.  With Interpol and the Russian military at his heels, he also has to deal with the Organization setting him up and trying to kill him as well as taking care of Nika (Olga Kurylenko), a girl who's being chased as well for similar reasons.I'm a fan of the ""Hitman"" games, mainly because its game play is different compared to others.  It's not a game where running and gunning is encouraged.  Instead, the focus is more on strategy and the different ways you can go about assassinating targets to make it look like it was either an accident or just a very clean shot.  Since the video game series is unique compared to others, I was hoping to say the same for the film.  Unfortunately, I could not, but that doesn't mean it was a terrible experience at all.The main problem I had with the film is that the plot was too complex.  After watching it twice, I still didn't quite grasp what was going on, who certain people were, and why some action scenes occurred (all about the Metro scene).  At one point, I would think I would understand what was going on only to be confused five minutes later.  Furthermore, the film is titled ""Hitman,"" but it could have also been ""Hitman and the Interpol Investigation"".  Too much time is devoted to the head of the investigation, Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott), when it should be focused more on 47, especially his background, and his relationship with Nika (which I never quite understood where that was going either).  Finally, there are too many characters in the story that are not needed or that could use some fleshing out (Agent Smith, Udre Belicoff).  They are crucial to the plot, but since the viewer doesn't know much about them, it never really makes sense what they are doing or how they are affecting everything.The acting was above par for this type of film.  When Timothy Olyphant was announced to play 47, I remember fan boys crying out against it.  Even though I would have preferred somebody else (not Vin Diesel though), he still did a fine job, but I wasn't that pleased on how the character acted in the film (I'll get to this later).  Dougray Scott, probably best known as the bad guy in ""Mission: Impossible II,"" was great as the Interpol agent.  Some of his scenes could have been cut to leave more room for 47's story, but he was still enjoyable and balanced out the film nicely with his demeanor compared to 47's.  Olga Kurylenko looks great, but her acting didn't do much for me.  Her chemistry with Olyphant was unconvincing and not truly believable.  Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond from ""LOST"") showed up and was wasted in his role as Udre Belicoff.  It was great to see him in something else, but the film never did anything with his character and it was disappointing.The film, directed by Xavier Gens, does have a great look about it.  The locations from the train station to a church to even a bathroom all look beautiful.  He also knows how to shoot action well and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace.If a film is called ""Hitman,"" people are probably going to watch just for the action, which is delivered in spades and is the highlight of the film.  They are all shot fine and do not contain any ""shaky-cam"" or quick cutting which was much appreciated by me, but they lacked something.  Many of the action sequences just seemed to happen for no reason either then to showcase some violence.  Unlike the ""Bourne"" films, where the action has a purpose, it's not really the case here.  Also, I stated earlier that the games pushed for more strategy than just blowing everything away.  In the film, it's the opposite way around and it eventually becomes a mindless action film.  I was praying to have a creative assassination played out in true ""Hitman"" style, but I never got that either.Finally, my biggest gripe with the film is how our main character, Agent 47, is written.  In the film, he has a range of emotions, which for me, was a problem.  In the game, he was always serious with a rare, but dark sense of humor.  He would seem surreal in the game and above being a human.  The film changes that and makes him more realistic and like any other individual that takes away his unique personality.  I wanted to see more brooding and less talking and smiling.Overall, ""Hitman"" is an above mediocre film based off a video game.  It doesn't do justice to the already amazing game and it's unfortunate.  Still, it packs a few solid action scenes, great cinematography, and some good acting.  If only the plot had been stronger and the character of 47 better written, this film would have been surprisingly awesome.",N/A
779242,"I have reviewed several of Howlin' Wolf's CDs in this space previously and had expected that this documentary about the life, the times and the influence of this incredible blues performer would merely be an appetizer for further reviews of his music. Not so. This well-done, lovingly put together and extremely informative documentary is a worthy viewing for the novice and old Wolf aficionados like me. Thus, rather than placing this commentary as a tail to some other Wolf entry it is worthy of separate entry here.In this presentation filled, as always in this kind of work, with the inevitable ""talking heads"" we go from Wolf`s roots down in the Mississippi Delta, cotton country and nothing else, in the 1920's and 1930's through to the first stop up the Mississippi at Memphis on to the Mecca Chicago in the post- World War II period and finally to international renown in the blues revival started by the likes of The Rolling Stones in the mid-1960s. In short we are treated to a view of the trajectory of Wolf's life; unlike let us say Son House with whom Wolf worked with in the old days who stuck with the country roots, from country blues of the back road jukes to the electricity of the urban ghetto that made those old blues jump for at first migratory urban blacks and then young whites like this reviewer. Along the way many of the musicians that worked with Wolf like Hubert Sumerlin, a blues guitarist legend in his own right, and Sam Lay as well as Wolf's daughters, the Chess Record producer Marshall Chess and others give some amusing stories and anecdotes on the life of the great bluesman. And seemingly as always when blues or rock and roll are mentioned  little segments with the ubiquitous Sam Phillips of the well-known Sun Recording studio in Memphis.I do not generally comment on (or for that matter look at) the special features sections of DVD. Not doing so here would be a mistake. There is some nice home movie footage, some interesting Wolf stories by his companions and rivals, a nice segment on the rivalry between Wolf and Muddy Waters to be ""King of The Chicago Blues"" and a recording of a radio broadcast of Wolf doing Little Red Rooster. Damn, I flipped out the first time I heard that song when it was covered by The Rolling Stones in the early 1960's. I also flipped out when I first heard a Wolf recording of it. I don't know what I would have done had I heard it on my radio then. Probably started hitchhiking for Chicago.All of this information is nice but I am sure the reader is just as interested to know about the music. Oh yes there is some great footage of classic Wolf efforts. Of course for this reviewer number one is always Wolf's Little Red Rooster. Christ, he is practically eating the harmonica by the end of the song. Lovin' Spoonful, Moaning at Midnight and a host of other songs get their usual Wolf professional treatment. That is a point to be underscored, he was a professional in his approach to the music, its presentation and the way that he could influence a genre that he practically build (along with his competitor Muddy Waters) from scratch. If you need an hour of the Wolf doin' his Midnight Creep then you really have to see this documentary. Kudos to the filmmakers on this one.",N/A

1082630,"I know, I know, this is low-budget zombie cinema so why harp on the use of ideas that have been used and re-used hundreds of times before?  In fact, why watch these type of films in the first place if you're going to be overly critical right?  True, that's a good couple of points except... at one time, independent horror films weren't only awesome BUT also original and scary.  I suppose every time I pick up one of these movies I hope to find something different or special... oh well, maybe next time huh?  Automaton Transfusion is one of the newest(seems like there's at least 3 more every Tuesday release day) independent attempts at the zombie genre.  Sporting the controversial(to me at least) ""running dead"" approach and a filming style that could make for Epileptic seizures at worst and mild nausea at best, Automaton Transfusion features a military experiment gone awry(shocking!) and a town overrun by the infected for our protagonists to escape from.  As I said at the top, pretty basic stuff, with our leads being an even more basic mish-mash of high school types(i.e. cheerleader, outcast, overweight loser, lone black guy in entire town, etc.) that you've seen plenty of times before.  The gore runs from good, to at times even inspired(a torn off lower jaw still has me wondering how it was done so well?) but is so overly absurd that it's never really gross, but it's still entertaining(by the way, the scene on the cover unfortunately never occurs).  The acting... is to be expected for this type of picture, not always bad, but never really good either(probably a little better than most of it's kind though).  The zombies actually come off much more like the infected from the 28 Days Later franchise, mostly just regular looking people, except covered in blood and running around biting the living.  The pluses about the film are that it hits the ground running(pun intended) and doesn't bore us with too much buildup and other unnecessary drama(it knows what it is), basically just running from one undead attack into another(in a nicely scant 75 minute package), and the scene where a zombie rips an unborn baby from a mothers stomach and devours it in front of her(I'm a horror fan... what do you want me to say?  Loved it!).  I had high expectations for this and maybe that's why I'm so hard on it upon my initial viewing(but maybe not either)?  For fans of newer low-budget and independent zombie cinema this should provide enough goods to entertain, but still is probably only worth a rental first.  *SPOILER ALERT*  I never give away spoilers in reviews but this one is big enough that I figure I should(not to mention I kinda wish I knew about it before buying)... the movie ends with a ""To Be Continued.""  Yep, just thought you might want to know before investing the time and money.",Automaton Transfusion

David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is now in charge of the combined sections, while Swindon's former boss, Neil (Patrick Baladi), has been placed above David, and he proves to be the kind of perfect boss that David has always fancied himself to be.  David's naked jealousy, so transparent to everyone around him, is as painful to watch as it is hilarious.No show has made me laugh and wince simultaneously so often.  Gervais and his co-writer Stephen Merchant have the courage to take these characters to their logical fates, leading to an unusually downbeat, though honest, conclusion for a truly great show.

649508,"I went into watching this with no idea what to expect. I haven't really seen Jennifer Garner in much of anything (wasn't an Alias fan) but I like Kevin Smith and I think Timothy Olyphant is really cute :) so I decided to give it a chance.This is actually a very sweet, heartfelt little movie. It doesn't contain many earth-shattering revelations about the Meaning of Life but it is head and shoulders above most romantic comedies, in my opinion. It does bring up some interesting points in answer to the question, ""How well do we really know the people we love?"" I thought that Garner's characters' struggles with the aftermath of her fiance's death - the big secret he concealed from her, dealing with her ex-future-mother-in-law, the roommate who blames himself for her fiance's death, the roommate who is in love with her, the friend who was complicit in her fiance's dishonesty who she's now attracted to, the ""other woman,"" etc. - were realistically-portrayed and entertaining to watch.Garner was delightful in this role and I thought portrayed the emotions and mental struggles of her character very authentically. Kevin Smith was great - you forget what a good actor he can be because his own movies get so bogged down in substituting volume of dialogue for quality. In this he actually brings a lot of subtle humor and heart to his role, which in his hands would probably have not been handled nearly as deftly. Timothy Olyphant is deliciously sexy and he also brings a lot of subtle light and shading to his role, and plays the romantic hero in a bit of a different way than you usually see. The movie did have some interesting points about how much we blind ourselves to the faults of the people we love. One of my favorite scenes was very near the end, when Gray is talking about a perfect day on the river she shared with her fiance. At the end of the day, driving home, he says he needs to tell her something, and she asks if it will make her happier or less happy. When he says ""less happy"" she tells him not to tell her. I think we all have a tendency to choose blissful ignorance over painful knowledge where are loved ones are concerned, and can make ourselves be happy with that even when we know we're choosing not to know the whole truth about them.All in all, this is not a real ""feel-good"" picture although the ending is happy. It's not a tortured indie but nor is it a brainless mush of a rom-com that we've all seen a hundred million times. I liked it because it was serious and dealt with tough subjects but was uplifting overall. I hate brainless movies, but I also dislike how depressing many ""serious"" movies are. I don't need any more reasons to lose faith in my fellow man; if I want to see man's inhumanity to man all I have to do is turn on the evening news. I liked ""Catch and Release"" because it was not a dumb movie but it was not depressing either. Recommended for cynics like me, who still believe in love at the end of the day. :)",N/A
988078,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie in Laguna when it was new.  Corky Carroll, David Nuuiwha, Mike Hopps, Rocky (thanks for the ride home, bro), and a crowd of hooting locals watched it.  Honk produced a thumping soundtrack in sync with the action, the beat punctuated with saxophone; the intervals pulsing with piano.  Gerry Lopez captured the imagination of the surfing world in this movie.  A dozen copy-cat movies would follow.  Everybody started riding seven-six pintails at California beach breaks hoping to emulate Gerry.  Mac/Freeman got rich off this movie as they re-released it or toured the surf movie circuit with it again and again, with updated versions.  It was really popular.I especially enjoyed the insightful commentary by the likes of Dru Harrison (a really hot South Bay surfer that passed a few years ago, RIP), Drew Kampion (one of the few surfing writers with any literary talent), and Chuck Dent (an anti-hero of the highest order).  Some of the sixties (which lasted until 1973) philosophy seems dated today, but most of resonates truth.  The surfing seems stiff and simple, compared to the manuevers done today, but it was state of the art at the time.  My old surfing buddy, Mike Hopps, for example, shown on 3 waves (blond guy on a white board at Rocky Point and Pipeline), really labors just to complete a bottom turn and off-the-top.  The portraits of David Nuuiwha and my high school classmate, Brad McCaul (one hardly ever saw him in Algebra II, because he was always in Hawaii) focus on the best California surfers at the time.  McCaul's surfing at the Santa Ana River Jetty used to blow my mind.  Nuuiwha's surfing was poetry in motion, smooth, like a yoga or zen master would surf. Mike Purpus, hated at the time, surfs really well in this movie.  But most of the surfing features Hawaii, glorifies ""da country"" (it's not the same anymore on land) living, and especially Gerry Lopez.  Chuck Dent's (RIP) diatribe at the commercialism creeping into the sport was prophetic.  Rick Griffin (RIP), a famous surfing and psychedelic artist, did a neat poster for the movie.The movie documents the end of the golden era of surfing, when it was done for the love of the sport, not money, fame, or competition.  It was a great time to live, and I'd love to do it again on today's boards, to tell you the truth.If you were a surfer in the 70's, you've probably seen this movie already.

399298,"""The Late Shift"" is based on Bill Carter's book, a blow-by-blow account of the back-stabbing battle for NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" that was waged in board rooms and over power lunches on two coasts 1990-1993. CBS approached Jay Leno (Daniel Roebuck) while he was ""The Tonight Show""'s guest host, hoping to lure him to a competing late night talk show. But Leno's agent Helen Kushnick (Kathy Bates) preferred that Leno seek a deal with NBC that would guarantee him the job when Johnny Carson (Rich Little) retired. David Letterman's (John Michael Higgins) ""Late Night"" had been a hit for NBC for a decade, and Letterman expected to succeed Carson himself. With a waffling NBC trying to retain both comedians, CBS courting Letterman with a favorable deal, and Kushnick using any means necessary to hang onto ""The Tonight Show"", this comic drama went on for three years.""The Late Shift"" peeks behind the curtain at some of network television's big personalities, their ambitions, tactics, and professional dilemmas. It's largely true, as far as I can judge from articles I read about the saga at the time. Leno and Letterman are represented sympathetically. David Letterman comes off as an obsessive neurotic who tends to be glum -but less so than he does on his show. Leno seems like a nave guy who doesn't want anyone to get hurt. Letterman and producer Peter Lassally (Steven Gibson) half-jokingly compare CAA agent Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams) to The Godfather. Helen Kushnick's weapon of choice seems to be extortion. She sued Bill Carter but is now deceased. It's funny to watch NBC's John Agoglia (Reni Santoni) and Warren Littlefield (Bob Baleban) go around in circles over the same issue for years. The DVD (HBO 2005) offers subtitles in English, Spanish, French and dubbing in Spanish.",Late Shift VHS
283485,"I enjoyed this as a compelling movie in its own right, before checking the historical background in any detail.I concluded, after some historical research, that the great issue in the film was the debate regarding imperialism (represented by Gordon in a ""White Man's Burden"" sort of way) versus the  resistance to ""foreign entanglements"" (represented by Prime Minister Gladstone).  The battle with the Mahdi was really a secondary theme historically.Gladstone was presented as a wily politician which I think did him a disservice, although many of his views are still represented fairly.  Gladstone consistently through all his administrations favored self-rule and not imperialism.  A major passion in his political career, for example, was for the movement to home-rule in Ireland and the avoidance of becoming entangled in foreign wars and the affairs of other nations generally.  In this endeavor he was thwarted by the growing imperialism of many of his countrymen who often seemed to have, like Gordon, the most altrusistic of rationales.  The affairs depicted in this film occurred in Gladstone's second administration.  He had been returned to power after Disraeli (the former and decidedly imperialist Prime Minister) had obtained control of the Suez Canal in Egypt.The movie is relevant today not so much in the sympathetic viewing of a previous Christian-Muslim scrap, but in raising the whole issue of latter-day imperialism versus  a more sober refusal to become embroiled in foreign brawls.The hero of the film in my eyes was Gladstone and the message has yet to be deduced by many of today's politicians.",N/A

1095639,"After Universal Studios' smash hit comedy ""Bruce Almighty"", I figured that the powers-that-be would waste little time in trying to cash in on that success and attempt a sequel. But time went by and I never heard any word on another Jim Carrey `Bruce' sequel. That is, until about three or so years later when I read about a sequel to ""Bruce Almighty"", directed yet again by Tom Shadyac (""Bruce Almighty"" and ""Liar Liar""), but this one wouldn't focus on Jim Carrey's character from the first movie; but instead would follow the exploits of rival anchorman Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who would find himself face-to-face with God (Morgan Freeman reprising his role) in the appropriately named ""Evan Almighty"".""Evan Almighty"" follows the blossoming political career of former news anchorman Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who has recently become a junior congressman and has moved his family into an upper-class suburban neighborhood. But things don't seem to go as planned for Evan, whose motto of ""Change the world"" is shared by none other than the Almighty God (Morgan Freeman). It seems that God is planning another flood of Biblical proportions and He wants Evan Baxter and his family to build an ark to save not only themselves but all the animals, in pairs of two of course, and anyone else who will listen to their message. Of course, Evan resists, but it isn't long before God's request gets through to him after numerous shipments of lumber arrive at his front steps and animals follow him everywhere he goes, Evan finally submits to God's will and with the aid of his family builds the ark, becoming a modern day tale of Noah that must be seen to be believed.I for one thought Jim Carrey's film ""Bruce Almighty"" was absolutely hilarious, and when I heard that the sequel was not even going to feature Jim at all, I figured that this must not be all that good of a movie, since he chose to pass up on the chance to make a sequel for what was easily one of his funniest movies in a while. However, I've been wrong before and I was wrong yet again, because not only is ""Evan Almighty"" funny, but I think it is actually a better movie than its predecessor, which surprises me to say.I never thought that based on the first film that Steve Carell would be able to make his character of Evan into anyone worth watching or even rooting for, but after seeing him in this movie I was clearly mistaken. Evan's journey over the course of this film sees him go from self-absorbed junior congressman who puts his family on the backburner to further his political career, to a humble man that is all about his family and is willing to listen and do what God wants. His was a much deeper journey than Bruce's was in the first film, but even with the somewhat more dramatic story, the movie was still just as funny, if not funnier in some instances than ""Bruce Almighty"". Morgan Freeman continues his terrific portrayal of God that he started in the first film. As far as actors go, Morgan is probably one of the few, if not the only actor, who could pull off this role without camping it up or crossing questionable lines. He always manages to portray God as He should be, as a loving Creator who wants His creation to love Him and to change the world for the betterment of mankind. John Goodman as a morally questionable senator was fun to watch, and was an appropriate choice for a source of conflict in the movie. Lauren Graham (TV's ""Gilmore Girls"") was very good as Evan's loving wife who supports him in all that he does while struggling to hold herself and her family together when it seems her husband has possibly lost his mind after choosing to become a modern day Noah. And lastly, Wanda Sykes was hilarious as Evan's assistant and provided some of the funniest one-liners in the entire film, a benefit no doubt of her stand-up comedy roots. Her scenes in the film were always enjoyable and she stole every single one of them.Overall, if you saw ""Bruce Almighty"" and loved it then I'm sure you'll enjoy ""Evan Almighty"". If you were one of the people that either saw ""Bruce Almighty"" and hated it, thinking that it was wrong (in a Biblical sense) in every way possible, or if you just weren't interested because you thought that it might offend you or something to that effect, then you too should give ""Evan Almighty"" a chance.

806342,"Calendar GirlsDuring a business trip to Washington, D.C., I saw the original Rylstone calendar on which the movie was based.  I was intrigued, to say the least so had to see the film when it came out.  Later, I bought the DVD (this, like a similar film--The Full Monty--is one you'll want to have in your DVD library).The film is loosely based on a true story, of a North Yorkshire District Women's Institute group who posed for a caalendar to raise money for a hospital waiting room sofa where John, the husband of one of the members had died of leukemia.It is a story of love and compassion, and also of the problems brought on by fame.  It is heartwarming, humorous, witty, touching, and utterly charming.There's nudity, but presented in a tasteful way.  You'll love all the women in the tiny fictional town of Knapley.  Kudos to the magnificent Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, who play Chris and Annie (the characters on whom the film was based).Buy it, rent it, enjoy it!Highly recommended for sheer entertainment value.",N/A
1138736,"STEP UP 2: THE STREETS, man, it's a clumsy film title and hearing it probably won't make you catch your breath in anticipation. But hold up. This is a pretty good musical drama. It's also a sequel toStep Up (Widescreen Edition), the 2006 Channing Tatum/Jenna Dewan surpriser which made enough duckets in the box office so that, now, we get a return visit to the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts.A wave of public disturbances has hit Baltimore, public disturbances in the way of sizzling street dancing, baby. This time out, the troubled kid is Andie (Briana Evigan), an orphan who gets in trouble because of her street gang affiliation but who then gets a second chance when she's accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts. But it's not all about Andie. When her time spent at the MSA gets her booted out of her street crew, the notorious 410, she forms her own crew, consisting mostly of misfit students at the MSA. And, of course, there's an ongoing underground dance competition. And, of course, there's an exhilarating, stop-the-presses dance battle at the end. Naturally, the dance-off is between the MSA crew and the 410.It's a straightforward, by-the-numbers story, but we all know that the story is just there to prop up the spectacular dance sequences. The acting by the kids is serviceable, with Briana Evigan, daughter of Greg Evigan, holding the viewers' attention with her sexy, spirited presence. The other standout, to me, is scene-stealer Adam G. Sevani, who plays the gangly, geeky Moose. On the other hand, that guy who plays the stuffy dance director is awful.This is a PG-13 flick, so it's got pretty tame street cred. One of the kids gets roughed up a bit and a dance studio is vandalized. The tough talking, keeping-it-real smack the kids spout here is about as tough and keeps it about as real as a 1970's Kurt Russell Disney movie. Near the end of this flick, does anyone really buy into that boisterous crowd being swayed so easily by Andie's ""We call this a battle, but what are we fighting for"" speech? Yikes!There are some good-looking folks in this cast, so if you're wondering about the raunch factor, well, there's a kiss at the end, which I guess is smoking enough that it won the 2008 MTV Best Kiss Award, for whatever that's worth. But most of the lascivious stuff pops up in the dance routines.Apologies to the bellylicious Briana Evigan, but the backbone of STEP UP 2 is the electrifying street dancing. While the plot here is as anemic as that of the first film, the dance elements in this sequel are even more dynamic and definitely more street-centric. Breakdancing, krumping, popping, locking, you name it, it's here. Briana herself shows off some skills, but, really, the sickest moves are demonstrated by the 410 crew, by Adam Sevani and by the actors who play Monster, Cable, and Missy. Robert Hoffman (Chase) doesn't have Channing Tatum's magnetism, but he contributes with some nifty popping. Speaking of Tyler Gage (Tatum), he drops in for an extended cameo, to add continuity and provide a link to the first STEP UP. His one-on-one dance battle with Andie happens to be one of the movie's showstoppers.The music is so key to movies like this. The STEP UP 2 soundtrack, aggressive and with plenty of head-bopping hooks, is a crucial supporting character. Viewers be cautioned, as these songs  may induce manic bouts of getting down (or attempts at getting down). Just don't hurt yourself. Some of the hot tracks included are Flo Rida & T-Pain, ""Low,"" Missy Elliott's ""Shake Your Pom Pom,"" and Digital Underground's classic ""Humpty Dance."" This last track, by the way, is perfectly, hilariously used in the MSA crew's online prank.STEP UP 2: THE STREETS isn't as sanitized as HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but neither does it come close to the gritty reality of, say, theRizedocumentary. Still, the focus here is on the dancing. And, when it comes to that, the pulse of the street beats in this film.",Step Up 2: The Streets Dance-Off Edition

337893,"I have to wonder if the people reviewing this Hammer interpretation of the Mummy watched the same film I did. I found this to be one of the lesser Hammer productions. Hammer began making some good looking horror films because the genre was getting tired and Universal was churning out low budget horror flicks for a quick buck. This version of the Mummy is not even on par with the 1940's Universal Mummy films which spanned four serial type horror sequels. Forget about the original film starring Karloff, it doesn't hold a candle to that moody,somber masterpiece!  Karloff's performance is creepy and Jack Pierce's make-up is absolutely incredible! Christopher Lee may have size but, he does nothing with the role of the undead protector of the tomb. Even though he does walk faster then the laughable Mummies from the 40's, it's not so fast that he could catch anyone. As slow as the Mummies were in those Universal 40's films there was a sense of relentless pursuit, normal people get tired mummies don't. I guess with thousands of years of sleep they can go for a long time! LOL! The brilliance of the 1932 classic with Karloff was that he was supernatural and he killed his enemies with curses! You can't run from that and it makes it all the scarier that there is no place to hide. I rate this film 2 1/2/ stars for some effort and seeing the Mummy in color. I hope the sequels are better than this one. It's just didn't add much new to the character.",N/A

He invites his beautiful family for his annual 4th of July birthday bash.  One by one the family members die in gruesome ways.  However, the culprit is not a psychotic killer but various creepy crawlers (lizards, alligators, snakes, tarantulas, and even a giant alligator snapping turtle).  Nature is getting revenge on humans for polluting their environment.  This movie boasts a high body count, and it is fun to see who will die next and how they will die.Sam Elliot and Joan Van Ark are among the cast of veteran actors from the seventies.  The film is beautifully shot on location in a Florida park using live reptiles and amphibians.  I recommend adding this gem to your ""Nature Gone Wild"" collection.Favorite Scene:  When Michael shoots himself in the leg while running through the woods.

1159872,"When will this long and tedious journey ever end? Like all good new ideas, Lost started off brightly and got us all hooked... great characters, bizarre happenings, inexplicable coincidences, amazing miracles, the lot.But that was hundreds of years ago. And yet here we are, still watching little groups of two and three characters marching about in that now oh-so-familiar undergrowth, holding flaming torches above their heads on God knows what missions... find the hut, find Jake, watch out for The Others, now watch out for the Other-Others with machine guns blah blah blah blah blah.And still the flashbacks continue. And, in yet another twist, flash forwards as well. We're leaping back and forth in time, with each character getting their 'turn' every week, in an ever-growing confusing tangle of plotlines and sub-plots until we feel like we're drowning in a giant bowl of spaghetti.And even now it's not over! After four long long long series (this one is half the length of the other series, but seems twice as long because we've seen most of it before, over and over and over again), six of the main characters finally get OFF the island!Hurrah! The Lord be praised! But hold on to your hats... no sooner have they returned to the real world, than we find out that they've all got to go BACK to the island! Oh God, please, no, make it stop!Somebody in these great Amazon reviews says if you've never seen Lost, watch just the very first episode, and the very final episode when it gets shown... and you'll probably not miss a thing. How right he is!This series gets 2 stars because it's shorter than the other series, plus I like the Hawaii beach location they've been using... even though by now, I'm beginning to recognise every tree, every clearing and every hillside.Might go there for my holidays... bet nobody else has thought of that.",N/A

Exquisite!This movie is the best I have seen of this year's crop, perhaps the best in years. It can be matched but it is difficult to see how it can be excelled. For now, I put it at the top of the heap for the academy awards: that is, if the academy actually made awards to the best movies of the year, which it does not. Its award usually goes to the ""American"" movie that garners the most money no matter how bad it may be, nor how good its competitor are. Therefore we can expect this movie to at most get an ""honorable mention."" But if things were right in the Hollywood firmament, this would be the one to beat.Despite the academy's predilection for picking the ""money hogs (and dogs)"" over truly good movies, ""Doubt"" will surely make their nasty task of ""weeding out the best to get to the rest"" more difficult this year.Streep is back up to her old ""Sophie's Choice"" form and takes no prisoners.

The first disc, according to the booklet (haven't had a chance to watch these yet) shows: The Man Trap; Charlie X; Where No Man Has Gone Before; The Naked Time. This is radically different in sequence. While I am not a 100% purist, particularly where the original series goes (since the main characters were all at the same place at the end of each episodes), it is still odd that we have such a huge dichotomy in the sequence of the shows.

Tom doesnt just scrape the bottom of the barrel when it comes to getting laughs, he breaks through the bottom of the barrel scraping the ground the barrel is on to get laughs. And he still fails!!!

799268,"First, it must be understood that Humberto Sol&aacute;s does not make films in the style most familiar to North American audiences.  His are NOT action films that involve two hours of blowing things up and wildly destructive automobile chases.  That fact we must clarify right at the start.  His films are somewhat dry and slow moving, but packed with deep insight into the human condition and what makes us tick.This specific film highlights an aspect of human life all too common in North America today.  I refer to the negative impact that living without one or both biological parents can have on children.  This is particularly true when, in the aftermath of divorce, the parents differ on how the children should be raised and/or use the children as weapons against each other.In this case, we have a family split by politics, which adds another layer of interested to this story.Here we find 32 year old Roberto returning to Cuba for the first time since his father had taken him from the island as a young child.  Now a professor in the United States, he has come to find his mother and also to discover his motherland.  Neither one is easy for him to find.  Reunited with his cousin, Pilar, the two embark on a road trip across the island in search of Carmen, Roberto's biological mother.Jorge Perugorr&iacute;a has established himself as one of the most talented and capable actors in the world today.  Mario Limonta & Isabel Santos give excellent performances.

1124518,"I'll start off by saying that I found this film more engrossing than it's Best Picture rival No Country For Old Men, and that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our generation.  When he plays a role, HE IS the role.  I just love the way he pulls off that early 20th century look with the hairstyle, the mustache, and the trousers.  Truly amazing, he pulls it off to perfection.  The characters, the setting, and the scenery were quite exceptional and enjoyable.  The only reason TWBB is better for me than NCFOM is simply because there is much better acting and dialogue in this film hands down.  The film is also a period piece and helps the viewer relate a bit better to the characters and what type of environment they have around them.  For example, the scene where the supposed brother of Daniel Plainview is waiting by his house.  I think we all know who it is and why he's there even before he properly introduces himself to Daniel.  The man is dirt poor, and Daniel has just struck it rich.  Whether it was his brother, a relative, or an old friend, you know exactly that the both of them shared a past and that they are both meeting not by chance, but for opportunity.However in my honest opinion, both these afformentioned films don't seem to have a clear and decisive plot and above all else, a satisfactory conclusion to the story.  As excited as I was to see the great Daniel Day-Lewis on screen again, I cannot say the same for the film which is quite slow at times in delivering a particular scene and leaves you with an empty feeling afterwards.  The only true satisfaction I got (regarding the story) was finally seeing H.W. Plainview release himself from his father's control on his life.  It is a painful scene, but it's brilliant and was long overdue in the film.  The dialouge between characters was great, especially the lack of actual spoken dialogue between Daniel and his son towards the end of the film.  The grimaces, the smiles, the sarcasm, and the stares between Daniel and Eli Sunday were striking.Aside from all that, it pains me to say this, but again, I think the book and the film take another stab at God and at organized religion.  Now I may be reading too much into that, but when you think about it, most of the movie deals with God, religion, salvation, and conscience.  As a semi-religous person myself, I did not find a problem with the stab, I just found a problem with who in the end was right and who in the end was wrong.  Both characters when you look at it were villains.  Despicable people truly void of God or a conscience.  Eli was a self-righteous preacher who was in it for the money.  Daniel was an egotistical maniac who was in it for the money, the power, and the glory.  Not to mention he plays a horrible father figure to H.W.  So at the end of the film, are we to take away that a bigger ego defeated a smaller one, or that capitalism, greed, and self-righteousness conquers over God?  The ending leaves too much to be desired and doesn't present a strong enough conclusion to both protagonists.While I think it was merely a coincidence that NCFOM and TWBB were filmed in the same fashion, my only hope is that future films with such great capacity can successfully have a proper conclusion to the story and can no longer void itself of complete justice towards sociopathic villians like Daniel Plainview and Anton Chigurh.",There Will Be Blood

It would be too easy to dismiss her as hateful and motivated by envy, but is this a fair assessment of a child's view? Are we being asked to question the nature of her style of upbringing, being sweet, nice, productive, even tempered, ordered and denying base human emotion to the point of barely having the capaicty to register such feeling and thus allow it to journey, untamed, unacknowledged in our actions?Did she believe what she saw? Was she manipulated by those who were perhaps not as innocent as they claimed to be for fear of lost power and respect?The damage done is far reaching, compellingly tragic and infuriatingly inequitable. The conclusion almost viewed by the central figure as having finally reached a virtual pay back, her life for those she ruined seemingly, so unwittingly.This a complex study of intense, raw human emotion and both the key and peripheral performances are beautifully executed. Immensley tragic and stunningly beautiful in terms of cinematography and musical score.The capturing of the dynamic and historic essence of the time is perfection and one is filled with the kind of questions about the human condition that are so incredibly difficult to answer affirmatively and rely upon.This along with the sense that Brionay is not so much an intensely spiteful child as a child whoes unmanaged longings express themselves with a sense of prolonged tragedy any child might easily fall victim too.",N/A
1077345,"I absolutely loved this show when it originally aired in the 1980's and I have fond memories of it even still. But as is so often the case things aren't always as wonderful as we remember them. Watching the show now I do find it to be a bit dated, and even some episodes aren't as funny as I'd remembered them to be. With that said however the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari is timeless and still great fun to watch. They seem to have a limitless energy on screen and appear to be genuinely enjoying themselves. I will also say that despite the fact that season two is somewhat disjointed and the show seemed to be shifting direction from it's original premise, it is also the season that contains many of my favorite episodes. Worth mentioning is that like season one the original opening theme song by Billy Joel has been changed to something totally generic. Also, and again like season one, some episodes have scenes omitted that were shown in the original broadcasts. Admittedly though I only noticed this myself in one episode, where a sing along between Kip, Henry, and their two cellmates was omitted from a jail scene. When all is said and done I have great nostalgia for the show and I still enjoyed watching it. If only the powers that be had let the show go for more than two seasons and allowed them the time to develop and grow... who knows how great this little show might have eventually become?",Bosom Buddies: Season 2
276884,"Burnt Offerings was a good haunted house movie that I feel deserves four stars.  I think this was a genuinely good haunted house movie which used only a minimum of special effects.  While it did not live up to the great plot of the book, this film presented a good plot, nice character development, and fine performances from some of my favorite character actors (Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Bette Davis, Burgess Meredith, and Eileen Heckart).The DVD is only a ""good"" transfer and for some reason I have found that all VHS and DVD transfers of this film are troubled by excessively soft focus, lack of contrast and color problems.  However, it is not a terrible transfer and if you enjoyed the film you will like watching this DVD. The idea of an old house feeding off the life energy of occupants was not entirely new, but the literal and visual interpretation of this idea was pulled off very nicely.I was already familiar with the book and loved it when one night during the summer of 76 I noticed while driving home late one Sunday night that the film had unexpectedly opened at a local Connecticut theater. My wife agreed to see it right then and there without even returning home after our long drive from NY. We both loved the flick and enjoyed this ententaining movie and the acting of Oliver Reed and Burgess Meredith, two of our favorite actors. I remember that my wife couldn't watch the scenes which featured that strange chauffer and found those particular sequences very frightening. Again, here was a fine horror movie which didn't need screen violence or explicit gore to be effective.",N/A

I was saddened at the thought of these beloved character facing certain death.  The way they would risk their life's for a comrade that has gone missing.  It felt very natural and realistic, my bond with these characters was growing increasingly over these life-changing episodes that featured many mature themes that I thought this series wouldn't dare show.

970001,"Filmmaker Jon Braeley did a couple of things right with this one-hour documentary on Japanese Zen Buddhism.  He hired a skilledshakuhachi playerfor his soundtrack and as cameraman was able to take advantage of some wonderfully photogenic locations, including Sojiji, one of Soto Zen's main monastic training centers.It's too bad he didn't get a decent scriptwriter or a narrator able to pronounce Japanese.If you know absolutely nothing about zen, you might learn something from this film, though you're just as likely to get the wrong idea.  The film begins with titles superimposed over monks doing zazen:  ""Zen.  From the Sanskrit word, Dhyana.  From the Chinese word, Chan.""  In fact it's the other way round.  Zen is the Japanese word for Chan.  You might also get the idea that zen has a lot to do with home and garden design.  You surely won't come away understanding how zen is different from other forms of Buddhism.  In fact you might not even suspect it has anything at all to do with Buddhism.There's a lot of blather about one pointed concentration, freeing the mind, non-attachment, emptiness, becoming one with nature, living in the moment.  But these ideas are tossed into the pot without rhyme or reason, like someone making a stew with whatever they picked up out of the refrigerator.There is a short section on the technical details of doing zen (how to fold your legs, how to hold your hands, how to breathe), as well as demonstrations of formal, monastic style zen.  But I really doubt anyone new to zen would be able to do much on their own with the material presented here.The best parts of the films are interviews with zen roshis from both the Rinzai and Soto traditions. Unlike the narrated script, which is full of the platitudes you might find in an episode of Kung Fu, these gentlemen are quite practical and down-to-earth.  The Godo Roshi at Sojiji (whose name is mistransliterated as Dai Tow) explains that satori, or enlightenment, is not a special power or state of being.  It is simply becoming yourself.  There is, he explains (contrary to the narration), no such thing as a mind without thought, that as long is there is mind there is thought, there are sense impressions.  This is the nature of mind.  The important thing, he stresses, is to accept what is, without fear and without favor.Unfortunately, the interviews with the monks and roshis account for less than one quarter of this film's 60 minutes.  Anyone seriously interested in zen would do well to skip this film and instead find agood book, or visit a nearby temple or zen center.(Note that most of the 5-star reviews are from people with only one or two other reviews, most often other products from people who worked on this film.  Looks like promotion from friends and relatives.)#",The Zen Mind
90556,"I can't add much to the collection of reviews here, though I must recommend that the serious sci-fi movie fan actually read through them, they're entertaining themselves.  I loved the original in the theaters, I do like this newest version with the narration edited out, and the inconsistent happy ending edited out, but still, it's impossible to relive the wonderful experience of seeing the first run of Bladerunner back then, for many reasons.  But at the same time, there's no real fair comparison between this movie, and the thought provoking, prescient, brilliant literary quality novels of Phillip K. Dick, and ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" was one of his best.  A big hole in the logic of the movie should have been, given a future with an overpopulation and urban poverty problem, why would big, powerful, monopolistic corporations need to invest time, money, and other expenses into android technology?  People in such a future, indeed, in our present, are available to be the proverbial cannon fodder, and so would not have to ""see what"" Rutger Hauer's character saw with his genetically engineered synthetic eyes.  In the novel, the future human and animal populations were decimated by postindustrial pollution, warfare, and enviromental irresponsibility (and remember, Phillip K. Dick was writing a generation ago!).  So lonely, depopulated humans invented talking doors, ovens, and so forth, and artificial animals for those who couldn't afford real ones.  Artificial humans a logical outcome of such a future.  Now the movie worked so well visually, and the story line was so consistent with the older established film-noire detective genre, that this big difference with the book isn't a fatal flaw in the movie, but I give you all this background to note a real hypocrisy in the artistic differences between the director and the studio that resulted in these different movie versions.  In an interview on NPR, the director, the very same director still miffed that the studio changed his ideas for the first run of the movie, laughs off the interviewers question about how irritated Phillip K. Dick was with Bladerunner veering so far from the original important fundmental premises and situations laid out in the novel.  Ridley Scott than candidly admits that he ""never actually read the book,"" because he didn't have the attention span for it!  The NPR interviewer responds by stating that she can understand why the author might not have liked the movie then.",Blade Runner

1137488,"It is rare that I am at a loss for words, but in attempting to review this ""movie"" I must admit that I cannot summon up adjectives of suitable negativity to accurately convey my disgust. I will try. Imagine the excrutiating boredom of watching a small group of amateurish actors wander aimlessly in the woods for at least 90 minutes, uttering trite phrases. Those familiar with one of the most famous worst-movies-of-all-time, Robot Monster, will fondly recall cave scenes in which some joker (aptly named Ro-Man) wearing a moth-eaten gorilla suit and a diving helmet on his head menaced a diminishing group of clueless actors. It couldn't get worse than this, could it? Well, how about substituting stock footage of a growling grizzly bear as your scary monster, instead of good old Ro-Man? No one could possibly be this silly, you would reply. And I would have agreed, until I witnessed the nightmare that is Savage Planet.This movie is an utter, abject failure, and the scope of its failure boggles the mind. Indeed, one of the tag phrases offered by Amazon at the bottom of the review page for this movie is ""crappy sci-fi"". Amen.Whenever confronted by a truly execrable production such as this, my common sense tells me that everyone involved must, at some time, have realized that they were participating in something totally devoid of any artistic merit...something really, really awful. How could they keep a straight face? Did they really need money this badly?

1113963,"The other two reviews of this dvd are excellent and very perceptive. I can't help adding my own two cents, partly because I love this performance and partly because I just finished writing a review for a professional journal.Even though I had heard good things about the NY live performances, I was skeptical. How does one take polyphony -- even polyphony in which intimate individual feelings are paramount -- and create a theatrical piece, in which a sense of dialogue, of interaction, must be made visual? And how does one come up with a narrative? Book Four is not a madrigal cycle. (There are such things: a group of madrigals intentionally written with a longer narrative arc.)WARNING: possible spoilers ahead. As the film begins, it is evening. Six pairs of twenty-first-century lovers meet (separately) in an upscale restaurant in some unnamed European city (much later in the film we realize it's London). One by one, the camera introduces us to them: they exchange endearments; they profess undying love; they quarrel; but no one says ""It's not you, it's me"" or ""I think we ought to start seeing other people""--this is florid, take-no-prisoners Italian love poetry. The couples part; they anguish; they make tortured love one last, exquisite time; finally, they separate for good, and in the cold morning light, we see those left behind having their meager breakfasts, alone, at the same restaurant.One reason it works is that each couple is made up of one singer, one actor. The singers do all the pleading and recriminating, while the actors silently receive their partners' pleas. It's a stroke of theatrical genius. Because this is a film, we also get flashbacks that open up the visuals and provide context or background. Each individual's narrative is individualized just enough so that their heartache is believable.There are no bonus features, but the included booklet offers helpful essays by director and music director, artist biographies, and Italian and English texts of all the madrigals.Almost the only sounds heard in the film are the Monteverdi madrigals themselves. I Fagiolini, who enjoy a long familiarity with this repertoire, sing superbly. Their full-voiced vocal freedom, control, and ensemble precision are impeccable (imagine singing all these pieces without ever making eye contact with your fellow singers, or with a conductor). Their passion and musicality emerge intact as well. Buy it. It may be the most compelling music/theatre that you've heard/seen in years.",The Full Monteverdi

691296,"Two of the very best episodes of this series.I read the Sherlock Holmes canon for the first time only last month. Where was he all my life! I was so taken in by the stories' cleverness and style that I just had to have the Granada TV series. There is no one else like the young Brett as Holmes and it is unlikely that anyone will try to do the entire series again.The later episodes in the series run from good to hideous, but it's not really Brett's fault. When he had control over Holmes, the results were ideal. But the later films show him a mere caricature of the real Holmes. At least Hardwicke remained constant as Watson.Regarding these two shows, I don't know why Moriarty was dragged into the Red Headed League. It really isn't necessary, and it implies that Doyle's story is somehow inadequate as written. I find this to be my favorite of the Holmes stories, and the casting in the TV version couldn't have been better. The only other nick I have with it is that when Holmes knocks on Wilson's door and the fellow who has been digging in the basement comes out, his knees are very obviously wet, but there is no evidence that he was on his knees in dirt. I found this rather odd, but it is a minor issue.As for The Final Problem, I was spellbound all the way through. I felt that I knew Holmes and Watson well by now, and they were old friends. When Holmes and Moriarty fight it out at the end, we all know what will happen. And when they finally went over the edge, I was in awe. The way this was done on the limited TV budget was marvelous. I've never seen a scene of this type that was so effective.Then, as they continued to fall, I kept waiting for the freeze frame, showing them dangling in space - as well as in the viewer's imagination - for all time. What an excellent memory that would have been! I believe it would have gone down as one of my favorite TV scenes (of which I have few).But when they contiued to drop and drop, well past the cut off time, I started to get worried, and finally I was appalled when they both - as represented by two obvious dummies - hit bottom and bounced off the big rock.I just sat there cold, wondering how the HELL they could ruin a perfect scene like that. We all know what really happened to Holmes. Why did they show this? If they would have left it dangling, it would have made a perfect segue into The Empty House. I can't imagine why they chose to run to this. I know that in the book it is so, but things changed with Doyle after he finished this story, and if he had been thinking of more Sherlock in the future, I think he might have left them both dangling too.But this is a mere quibble. That's the way the story is, and that's the way they chose to film it. It is still one of the best of the series. How sad that Brett didn't get to finish all of the stories his way (I understand that this was his intention).",The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Vol. 5: (The Resident Patient / The Red-Headed League / The Final Problem)

381774,"I love camp, its THE aesthetic for me. And this film is Douglas Sirk on acid. Not as purely absurd or sleazy as John Waters' early trash art, but I think thats the film's grace. Its his first tight, mainstream satire of American cultural illnesses. The first half of the film really makes art out of the depressing Hell that innocent Divine must wade through. It lets up for awhile, and the second half isn't as strong, but its not an unbalanced film or anything. Its great seeing Divine carry a film as a somewhat normal protagonist and flex his acting and amazing presence. I really commend Waters for the stylized direction and soundtrack that brings the film to life, moving away from his previous low-budget cinema verite and oddball pop selections (that we still love so much). If you enjoy 50s  melodramas, punk rock, absurdist satires and Odorama, you'll find this is one of John's best.",Polyester VHS
233009,"I'm a big fan of private eye movies and television series.  I'm glad THE ROCKFORD FILES has finally come out on DVD, but I'm still waiting for MARLOWE, starring James Garner and Bruce Lee.However, I don't have an excuse for not having already seen Night Moves.  It's been out for over thirty years, and I bought the DVD a year ago.  I did finally get around to watching it, though, and it was as good as I'd hoped it would be.The story is pure 1970s, as evidenced by the cars, clothing, and some of the language.  But it also tells a timeless story of confusion and betrayal, and the layers of secrets that add to those.Gene Hackman stars as Harry Moseby, an ex-football player rather than an ex-cop.  Moseby has been broken down by family problems and the loss of his career, and seems to be barely hanging onto life by a thread.  Only the occasional missing persons case appears to keep him financially afloat and emotionally anchored.Hackman has always been a personal favorite of mine.  He can pull off any kind of role and look good doing it, even if the film is total cheese.  He's just a guy I look at and immediately respect.  His everyman stance and his charm just oozes from every pore.  As Moseby, he was a well-known football hero, and a lot of his friends still see him as a standup guy, but he doesn't let anyone in too close.Unfortunately, that same inability for closeness is what ultimately undermines his relationship with his wife, Ellen (Susan Clark).  When he first gets handed the case of the little runaway rich girl, Moseby isn't too interested.  Then he catches his wife cheating on him and tries to lose himself in the investigation.I liked the way the movie dovetailed back into the movie industry the way some of the old 1940s movies did.  Some of the best cinematic detectives have their roots in the twisted and sordid tales that came out of Hollywood.  This one has stuntmen and used up actors to season the tale, and it adds more credibility to it.The Florida footage on the case was extremely well done as well.  Director Arthur Penn (LITTLE BIG MAN, BONNIE AND CLYDE) manages the Hollywood and LA scenes well, then zips the viewer down for a peak at what was then Travis McGee's tramping grounds as John D. MacDonald wrote his adventures.  I liked the rough and tumble atmosphere of the land, the characters, and the twists and turns the plot took while down there.  Jennifer Warren plays femme fatale Paula in a haunting and sexy scene.Some of the most fun was watching a very young James Woods and Melanie Griffith taking their places on the stage.  Woods hasn't changed much, but his presence on the screen is intense these days.  He's another one of my favorites.  Melanie Griffith, young and hot and nude in several scenes, just burns up the celluloid.I really enjoyed Hackman's work in this movie.  As I said, I own it and intend to watch it again.  I'd really advise picking up TWILIGHT, with Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, and Hackman to really round out a double feature private eye/noir night.  Hollywood seldom makes films like these any more and it's a shame.",N/A

770786,"This moving documentary really merits being seen by everyone, no matter what their religion or sexual orientation.  While the issue of being both gay and Jewish doesn't seem like a conflict to those in the liberal denominations, it's a much more complex and anguished issue for those who wish to remain true to both parts of their core identity, living a frum life and being gay.  It seems like a dire contradiction in terms to devote your life to a religious tradition that essentially denies who you are, but for the brave individuals who agreed to appear in this film (some of them with false names or appearing in silhouette or with blurred faces), being Orthodox and still gay isn't a contradiction at all.For too many people, the issue of Judaism and homosexuality is a cut and dried prohibition, one verse in Leviticus.  They don't have any real-life experience with it, or think it doesn't exist in their ultra-frum communities.  But this documentary puts faces to that one verse, shows the people who are in very real pain and conflict over this.  It's easy to condemn or dismiss something when it only exists in theory, something you've read about, not something you suddenly find yourself dealing with in your own family or community.  People like Leah, Malka, Michelle, David, Israel, Mark, and Devorah are real people who have been living this double identity for years, struggling to come to terms with their orientation and how to still be frum in spite of it.  I think it's quite refreshing how the rabbis who appear in this film, though some of them are quite Orthodox, are speaking from personal experience in dealing with gay people.  While the Orthodox hold to the belief that the Torah is 100% the literal word of Hashem, these rabbis are flexible and compassionate enough, within that very conservative framework, to reinterpret the verse to find some sort of realistic solution to this problem.  Many people are killing themselves or suffering from depression because there is no support network for frum gays; it's completely unfair to compare not following this one particular mitzvah to deciding to also ignore mitzvot such as kashrut and keeping Shabbos.  Halacha is really not set in stone, and an alternative answer can always be found even with an Orthodox approach to reading the text.  It's also surprising how some of these long-bearded rabbis are more progressive and understanding than some secular people.It's unfathomable that anyone, after seeing this film and getting to know these people, could still insist that homosexuality is wrong because it's in the Torah, and that settles that issue.  Anyone with a heart would see the pain and frustration in people like Israel, desperate to reunite with his 98 year old dad; Devorah, who is married to a man in spite of being a lesbian; and Mark, who misses the yeshiva world even though he was estranged from it after coming out.  One's heart goes out to these people who either have to live double lives or live as openly gay in a world where early heterosexual marriage and large families are considered not only the norm, but the only way to live.  Hopefully some halachic solutions will be found for this issue sooner than later, so that the next generation of people like Malka, Michelle, David, and Israel won't have to struggle with being frum gays.The second disc contains a wealth of extras that really enhance the documentary.  Among them are an interview with Rabbi Steve Greenberg (whom I was honored to meet when he spoke at my [Conservative] shul in December '06), an interview with director Sandi Simcha Dubowski, a featurette, 'Trembling on the Road,' the trailer, interviews with five of the prominent rabbis featured in the documentary (and while they're quite Orthodox, they also seem compassionate and open-minded, wanting to find a halachic solution to this issue instead of just telling gay people to live celibate lives or pretend to be straight), a deleted scene, a discussion with people involved in Petach Lev, an Israeli group dealing with these issues, footage of an arcane Medieval ceremony to atone for ""sexual sins,"" and so much more.",N/A
1150008,"I might have liked this movie because I went into it with really low expectations, but I really think that this was a very well done Direct-to-DVD sequel.Sure, the plot was very close to the original movie, there were places where the dialoge was even groan worthy, but it wasn't enough to bog me down to the point where I couldn't enjoy the movie. The one aspect of the movie that surprised me was the CGI and action sequences. I was expecting something along the lines of 'A Sound of Thunder', but what was presented was much closer to what I've seen on shows like Lost and 24.There isn't alot to connect the cult film of the 80's with this film until the last half of the film when you find out a nice plot point that allow for a nice cameo from Dr. Falkner and Joshua.The reviews I've read on other sites seem to focus too much on how similar in plot this movie is to the original, or that none of the original actors return to reprise their roles. I didn't really see a need to include original actors except for the role of Dr. Falkner, and the original actor John Wood had retired from acting long before this movie was even though about. I thought Gary Reineke did a very passable Dr. Falkner in this sequel, and when you hear Joshua ask ""Shall we play a game?"" again you can't help but smile.As for the plot, I did see the similarities, but also saw its divergences. It felt like the plot was equal parts War Games, The Bourne Identity, and Hackers. It is a Direct-to-DVD movie so I wasn't expecting alot of originality, but there was definately a good mix to keep me interested.While this movie bears all the marks of being a lesser sequel, it stands out as one of the better direct-to-DVD movies I've seen.",Wargames 2: The Dead Code

1069660,"Vintage Shaw Brothers movie from '69, given the first class treatment from Image Entertainment. Samo Hung is NOT in this movie, nor did he work on it, but don't let that stop any of you Shaw Brothers/fu fans from checking out this cool nugget of a film. Very well-done, although I'm not familiar with the director. A very young Chang Yi has the lead role & looks good here. Actor Ku Feng is almost unrecognizable. The fu is sword swinging old skool; no wires, fairly exciting, just DO NOT expect the Venoms or Lau brothers choreography.  Despite not being directed by the maestro, Chang Cheh, it's quite bloody, and there are quite a few good set-pieces.Image, as usual, did a fabulous job; re-mastered, blemish free, widescreen picture; re-mastered audio & easy to read subtitles. Personally I liked this movie, if you read any of my other reviews you'll see I'm a hard-core fu fan, and my preference is Shaw Brothers/old-skool. I would definitely recommend this to like-minded fans, but not to people who only saw ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and think it's the last word on martial arts movies.

237521,"I realized that there was a reason that I recalled ""A Man and a Woman""; a film I'd never seen before.  It's theme became somewhat of hit back in the late 1960's.  I'm glad I finally watched the film because this is a very good movie.  The reason I liked it was because of its' ability to tell a unique love story.We meet a couple of individuals just as they are meeting each other.  Their relationship emerges from each person's tragic previous relationship.  We get this information in a series of video recollections that each shares with the other.  As their relationship grows, much is unspoken and we see the subtle hints that each picks up on.  The director, Claude LeLouch, keeps this from being a run-of-the-mill love story by throwing in a somewhat surprizing twist towards the end.  That leads to a conclusion that I thought was just the right way to say the right thing.The reservations that I have with ""A Man and a Woman"" is the elite aspect of the characters.  These are the ""Beautiful People"" who live in the fast lane of exclusive professions.  They each have a young child in boarding school (that's how they meet) and the children are beautiful and well-behaved.  That's surprizing since the parents are never all that sure if they'll be by to visit the kids from one weekend to the next.  I gripe about this because this could have been a love story that everyone could relate to.  The theme of ""love the second time around"" has been done before but the way this movie suceeds is by acknowledging the importance of the first love.  LaLouch's need to portray the woman's first love as some ideal, one-of-a-kind, super man deminishes the rest of us in comparison.  Couldn't the first spouse have been a mechanic, accountant, or bus driver.  Couldn't we have had characters and life styles we could relate to?  Oh well, I confess that I enjoyed watching Anouk Aimee in her lead role.  Sure beats Marjorie Main.  I was very comfortable with the overall message I took away from ""A Man and a Woman""",N/A

Since I can only pre-order this set for now, I'm giving it the benefit of doubt and granting it 5 stars. To be honest, I never expected the whole series to make it to DVD and in order to begin with. So I guess I'm gratefull it made it at all, regardless of the video quality it's in.My only regret is that they didn't start releasing the series to DVD in this fashion sooner (as box-sets, I mean). If they had, then they would have finished releasing it almost 2 years ago by now. My guess is that they wanted to test the market first to see if it would sell. The advantage to that is also that it considerably reduced the price for individual discs sold and made it more attractive to potential buyers.But I would have purchased it all anyway regardless of the price since... IT'S THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES !!!  :)  great nostalgia of a time long gone when I didn't have to work every saturday morning and I could watch the cool cartoons on TV with my kid sister.

The quality of the video is NOT Disney quality. (I don't think they were even remastered). BUT.. The quality is equal if not a little superior to what it looked like on my family's 20 inch cable TV back when it aired. And that, to me, is all I need.

227711,"I've listened to a lot of DVD commentaries before, and I'd have to say this is easily one of the best.  Between the cast and crew, there are enough bits of trivia, hilarious anecdotes and behind-the-scenes factoids (technical and otherwise, like the hurdles overcome to get the film made) to keep just about any listener enthralled for the entire length of the movie.  It could have been better with Sigourney and Paul Reiser included, but their absence isn't as conspicuous as you'd think since they are talked about plenty (all positively, of course).The bonus disc is also interesting, but similar to the extras on ""T2: Judgment Day,"" they are exhaustive and exhausting.  Whereas most DVDs don't go into enough detail, I think Cameron's go into too much.  These at least aren't presented in text form as they were on ""T2,"" which was enormously tedious. It was really great to see the actors all these years later, including Carrie ""Newt"" Henn all grown up.As special editions go, I'd say this one is worth every penny (even if bought at full retail).

155440,"This movie is almost 3 hours long but as a testament to how good it is you don't really feel it.  From the beginning you can tell you are watching a classic; from the great score to the excellent script and cast it's hard not to be caught up in the story and to be touched by it as well.  Despite its age, the film ages well because it covers themes that are still relevant today such as loyalty, adapting to new environments, self-sacrifice and lack thereof etc.  This movie stands the test of time and despite repeated viewings will still amuse, entertain and touch most of us to the core.Unfortunately, this DVD version of this great film is an unworthy version to pay any respect to this classic.  It hasn't been restored well and so many picture quality imperfections exist and the sound quality is just Dolby Digital Mono which should be improved.  There are no Special Features to speak of as well making you wonder if you are better off getting the VHS.  Here's hoping that they will consider another restoration project for this film to vastly improve the picture quality and the sound quality by adding Dolby Digital 5.1 or THX Surround options plus some Bonus Features worth shouting about.In the meantime, while this film is a true classic, you may want to wait for an improved DVD to surface so as to get the most enjoyment that you can from your viewing experience.  Perhaps a Blu-ray version may be just the excuse to restore this film to the quality that it surely deserves.

1060846,"This is one of the more enjoyable ""bumbling amateur criminals"" movies that I've seen.It's a UK/Canadian production but it's set in the U.S. and it stars David Schwimmer in my favorite movie role of his to date. His lugubrious manner is perfectly complimented by bouncy, James-Cagney-like Simon Pegg, a British comedian donning a perfect American accent. Their screen chemistry is wonderful.Joining them is another Brit with another perfect American accent plus tremendous sex appeal, Alice Eve, playing a third kooky wheel in this unlikely team of extortionists. I gotta say: the acting by everyone (Brit, American, and Canadian) is top-notch.The script by Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Andrea and American Billy Asher tries to avoid cliches -- or at least improve on them -- and Andrea's direction gives the film a slightly surreal touch altho the film retains a down-to-earth quality.That surreal touch plus its dark quality may limit this film's appeal, but those who like terrific acting and fast-paced fun may revel in that appeal.(To people who have already seen the film: there's a difference of opinion here and at the Amazon UK site about Simon Pegg's accent. I think that those who are familiar with Simon Pegg will be influenced by that familiarity and find his accent strange -- while those of us who aren't familiar with him will find his accent perfect, albeit energetic, Midwestern.

1152355,"Okay, Nancy Botwin herself might be included in the category of nefarious nitwits; that's only fair.  She is so very naive about the world of drug dealing, and finds out just how much she doesn't know in this third season of the series.She has experiences with U-Turn and Marvin that are both hilarious and unpleasant, and then along comes Guillermo, a new kind of thug who ends up wreaking havoc on Agrestic/Majestic that Nancy never imagined.Celia is by turns sympathetic and hateful, given her behavior towards her former husband and their daughter; yet we can also see how much she wants to love someone and how she drowns her sorrows in alcohol.Kevin Nealon, for my money, is the one who really shines. The SNL alum does his best and funniest work here as Nancy's CPA.I'm surprised to say this, but Mary-Kate Olsen does a nice job as Silas's religious girlfriend.Alexander Gould as Shane gets more screen time, and it is well deserved.

1100681,"When Nietzsche Wept is a fun little movie, but not much more. The academic mind may gather interesting tidbits of allusive material, anecdotes that qualify in flesh a mode and a period, but little else in terms of insight or theoretical enlightenment. It is unfair to ask of so much from a movie, but there have been gems which have accomplished much more without pretending half as much, which is the main reason for my two stars. There are dream sequences that skirt the parodic while insinuating to be reminiscent strains of a therapeutic groundwork, but these are really a far cry from being of any import to anything but excessively  reductive commonplace assumptions popo culture has already adopted grand scale. The passion of Nietzsche is depicted with emotional farce, but the actor here cannot do justice to the gentle genius that trumpeted the death of God, a death knell poeticized and antagonized by a secularism in disguise and denial. Whatever the merits of Nietzsche may have been, the shortcomings the movie's depiction of Viennese physician Dr. Josef Breuer are extensive and irresponsible, if one wishes to here locate historical accurancy rather than artistic liberty. Infact Dr. Breuer is a man so comical and absurd here we end up pitying a mind who should command reverence and applause. I do not know why this motion picture ends up ridiculing, even mocking a man who has had so much influence on contemporary culture. It is really disturbing to see a legacy so belittled and denigrated. Perhaps I am being too rough on the script, and I must also here note that I have not read the novel by Irvin D. Yalom, who also has written a cute paraphrase on Shopenhauer.Any vigor that may result from a revival of women who have influenced the course of history, yet had no claim in our paternalistic, phallocentric historical narrative, are debunked by its crass infusion of hysteria ironically presented without enough sensibility or attention to Bertha, who needless to say, deserves better treatment. Lou Salome is perhaps a positive presence in the movie, but she is also rendered without a modicum of wit or grace, and only her strength of character and presence of mind are evoked somewhat satisfactorily. Finaly the young Freud is but an aside and we are never offered an opportunity to understand his musings on the ""talking cure"" even slantwise.Finally the filmography, the editing and the presentation of the philosophy of Nietzsche are so reductive one comes out of this viewing hoping these fools had better sense than its director.It doesn't make you think and it doesn't make you question. Does it entertain? That depends on your taste, but if you enjoy zany productions you may come out of this with a laugh or two, otherwise any Hollywood movie has more to offer.",When Nietzsche Wept

Instead, the fight sequences--semis, SUVs, fighter jets, and helicopters all get in on the fun--are excellently choreographed and help to move the story along.

The films songs, ""Upside Down World"", ""Easy Goin' Day"", ""Ain't No Road Too Long"" and Big Birds lament ""I'm a Blue Bird"", are songs which have stayed alive for many children the world over.Sesame Street's Follow that Bird, as I recall, was the first film to tell a story about the streets characters and we were invited to see more of their world ... the street itself was rebuilt and expanded and had a rich realistic feel and artistically the look was very credible and contrasted the Muppet characters more imaginatively.Everything about the production was inspiring, the story was clear and tight, characters were very well performed, the puppetry as you might expect was first rate and parents enjoyed seeing the comic talents from John Candy and Chevy Chase who cameo ... Kermit even makes an appearance as his role as Muppet Reporter and if you look carefully you can see Elmo sometimes in the background, but you have to remember, this was all before he became a big star.Follow that Bird is really Big Birds story and for a generation who remember Sesames early years it is about time the big yellow chap got some cheers again for being such an inspiring figure.

653333,"Let's get something clear: I love the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, no matter what form they take, from TV shows to comics, but the movies have thus far always been my favorite medium. It takes some serious goofing up on a director's part to make me cast anything less than a fawning eye on my reptilian heroes...but in this case, first-time director Kevin Munroe has made me leave the theatre feeling disappointed, even though I had just been blasted by 87 minutes of my favorite sewer-dwelling ninjas. My god, what went wrong? - the animation was top-notch, the cast featured big names like Sarah Michelle Gellar (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") and Mako Iwamatsu (""Seven Years in Tibet""), and the film had a budget that topped that of all three previous movies. What could have possibly sullied the greatest chance to re-introduce the Turtles to a new generation?In ""TMNT"", the Turtles are a divided clan: with Leonardo (James Taylor, ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"") off honing his skills in Central America, Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield, ""W.I.T.C.H."") and Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) have pursued dead-end jobs in the civillian sector while Raphael (Nolan North) has turned to fighting crime on his own. Yet, when an ancient and dangerous power summoned by a powerful businessman (Patrick Stewart, ""X-Men"") threatens to be turned upon the city, the Turtles must come together in an effort to save the world....but with personal tensions running high between Leo and Raph, will they be able to remain a team?My first grief is with the story itself: while it'll easily appeal to younger kids and fans of the current TV series, don't the Turtles have enough time in their once-a-week primetime slot to relieve the need for magic and other supernatural elements as plot points? I mean, I know that arguing realism where the Turtles are concerned is a bit of a paradox, but I like to think that the previous three movies held a semi-realism and sophistication that served as a pleasant departure from the buffoonery of the TV shows; I like giant monsters, ancient prophecies, and stone statues coming to life as much as the next guy, but could writer/director Munroe really not come up with anything better than recycled serial fodder for his first feature-length movie?Also, I jumped for joy when I realized that most of the story's arc revolved around Raph and Leo...but my face fell when I realized that it came at the expense of Donny and Mike. While I was pleased by how the movie built on their rivalry (the showdown in the rain is the absolute best confrontation between the two, ever), I saw so little of their other two brothers that I occassionally forgot they existed; other than seeing both at the beginning of the movie and seeing Mike take a tumble on his skateboard, their input to the movie is extremely limited. This carries over into the fight scenes, where we see a few seconds' worth of Don wielding his bo staff and virtually nothing of Mikey swinging his nunchukas while Raph and Leo lead the charge. Shoot, even April (Gellar) gets better fight scenes!Smaller, less signifigant nitpicks include the film's choice of villain (who has no previous connection to the franchise) and the character design, which - apart from the Turtles and other non-human characters - looks like it was taken from ""The Incredibles"", with Max Winters hardly looking threatening as a human charicature and Casey Jones (Chris Evans, ""Fantastic 4"") sporting a chin from hell.On the good side, the movie really is a good example of fantastic CG animation, the voice-casting is fine, the action scenes are exciting (the brawl in the skyscraper takes the cake), and a decent amount of humor reminds me why I liked these guys in the first place. The Leo/Raph wound is re-opened and examined to its most personal level. Small scenes like Mikey sewer-skating and Raph's encounter with the pint-sized (albeit insanely destructive) monster build both character and charm, and make a point that the filmmakers are not entirely without an eye for detail.Alas, there's nothing good enough here to keep my attention beyond a second viewing that merely confirmed my belief in the film's inadequacy as an addition to the pre-existing trilogy. While any TMNT is better than no TMNT, I can honestly say that this latest incarnation has topped TMNT3 for disappointment...but even that one had a little bit for everybody, while the current offering panders to kids and strict CGI-lovers but delivers nothing to the more mature fans of the Turtles.Maybe next time, Warner Bros. will think twice before letting a first-time director at the helm of one of the century's biggest franchises...but until then, we're stuck with this.",N/A

1127831,"I really liked ""Feast of Love.""  I liked that it was for adults (finally!) in its sexual depictions.  I liked that its heart is optimistic despite the sadness it sometimes portrays.  And I liked the actors, among other things.What bothers me about ""Feast"" is that it could have gone to a higher level.  There are multiple moments when it's just sticky sweet or just dumbed down.In on scene, for example, ""Oscar"" releases a bunch of balloons and tells ""Chloe"" that they represent them. It's just awkward.  In multiple scenes Morgan Freeman's character, ""Harry,"" refers to infatuations at first site as being love - this coming from a character who's been married for decades and should know better.  Attractions at first sight do exist, but elevating them to such purity is for a teeny bopper movie, not one for adults and real world romance. Harry also refers to these encounters as if he's all knowing and as if people are this paper thin obvious when they find someone attractive.  At one point at the beginning Harry talks about love being a creation of the Greek gods.  Because Harry seemed to have extrasensory perception when it came to knowing when people were attracted to each other I was beginning to wonder if ""Feast"" was going to have elements of magical realism.  It doesn't and that's fine - but it just shows how the director just went too far in making things B&W; obvious.Robert Benton, the director, won an Oscar for ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" a serious adult film.  While I dislike that movie, I wished he applied a bit of the maturity of that film here.  ""Feast"" could have been almost literary in quality if it hadn't stooped to these silly depictions.The only movie that comes to mind that's similar is ""Love Actually,"" another movie that people either hate or love.  If you don't particularly like blunt sexuality in your movies then you'll want to avoid.  If you accept the sex as just being normal and you like movies about adult relationships then give ""Feast of Love"" a try.  I recommend it - but I am annoyed that the director squandered the opportunity to make something even more powerful and meaningful.",N/A

That being said-my husband and I did, at times, enjoy this strange but entertaining little film.As other reviewers have said-this film is somewhat confusing for the first time One Piece viewer. The film is made with the assumption that you've seen OP before and are up to date on the storyline. That didn't affect our viewing enjoyment too much-but it did make several scenes a bit ""over the top"" comedy-wise as we may have not ""gotten"" what they were trying to say.As a fan of comics and fantasy, I did enjoy the Super Power aspect of the story-though some of the fight scene violence may be a bit much for younger viewers. I have an eleven year old son and watched this without him, knowing that some anime can be ""adult"".  After viewing this, I'd let him watch this as you won't see more violence or adult humor than in your average PG film. As to the sexual situations-it's pretty much ""innuendo"" of the slapstick variety and fairly harmless.While not on par with some anime greats on my list-like Miyazaki's works or another favorite-Tokyo Godfathers, One Piece was just wacky and sentimentally heartfelt enough to recommend to fans of the series.3 stars.",One Piece: The Desert Princess and the Pirates - Adventures in Alabasta

If you believe that, then you may have never seen Quark.Produced from 1977-78, Quark starred Richard Benjamin as Adam Quark, Captain of the  United Galactic Sanitation Patrol ship, Richard Kelton as Fiscus (vegetable-human officer), Tricia and Cyb Barstable as Betty and Betty, clone twin engineers (for the price of one), and Timothy Thomerson as Gene/Jean, a transmute male/female officer.  Conrad Janis of Mork and Mindy fame, played Palindrome, and the `Head' included the top half of the shoulders of Alan Cailou.  While only lasting 8 episodes, the show has garnered an audience for memorable TV series  viewers, if not for the sheer lunacy of the show.Imagine, a garbage scow captain saving the universe from the evil High Gorgon, Zoltar the Magnificent and Zargon the Malevolent.

But, you can do anything with the Source (this is not a commercial for Radio Shack) if you only believe in it...anything...except explain just how Betty and Betty manage to hang onto Captain Quark in times of trouble, and those darned Daisy Duke short sets in the middle of space.  There must be some kind of fashion program at Perma One.  Gene/jean is funny however, as the he-she character switches at the wrong (did I break a nail) times.  As a science officer, Fiscus, is intelligent, but annoying.  The `Head' used here is obviously inspiration for Third Rock (and Shatner) who did the floating head routine so much better inspite of needing singing lessons.While the characters are memorable, the episodes suffer from something resembling too much effort for so little return.

157486,"by Dane YoussefThis is rumored to be animation-pioneer Ralph Bakshi's favorite among all his projects. And no wonder. This is his story!A 22-year old Jewish-Italian spends his time playing pin-ball non-stop and drawing. He still lives with his parents, an Italian man who cheats on his wife and a Jewish woman who's so emotionally torqued up--such a drama queen, that when Angelo comes home after a night with his lady, she hits him over the head with a frying pan and sticks his head in the oven.There's always domestic unrest in any family, particularly with interracial married couples who lived in the Bronx around this time. But they're so wound-up, so ready to snap--they come to blows and sharp instruments a little too quickly.Way too quickly, in fact. Angelo and Ida's Punch-and-Judy relationship--coupled with the problems that reside outdoors in the Bronx--Michael seems doomed to have some of it rub off on him. ""You hang around garbage long enough, you start to stink,"" as they say.But Michael has an outlet for his angst and confusion. Rather than fall into the trap many around him seem to, he vents himself at the drawing board. He draws a lot of the people and places in the Bronx. Although he seems to dislike many of them, they're so broad and colorful and wired, they translate easily to caricatures.Bakshi takes us to all the usual haunts we visit in his movies--trashy ghetto neighborhoods with buildings that look condemned, dirt-cheap apartments, behind the wheel of cars, rooftops, nightclubs, bars, brothels.The lives of all of the Bronx inhabitants: Jews, Italians, blacks, drag queens, junkies, vagrants, hookers, cops, thugs and the like. And by using animation, Bakshi (and Michael) sort of illustrate their world and their eccentricity, which is so dangerous, it borderlines on insanity.I wasn't particularly crazy about the disco remix of ""Scarborough's Fair."" What can I say? I fell in love with the original.But I suppose it does fit in with the nature of the film. Bakshi uses a lot of shots of Michael playing pinball. He's a big pinball fanatic. It's obviously a metaphor, perhaps for the hectic universe in which Michael bounces from one scenario to another, for which he's constantly out of place.Carol is a black woman who works at a local bar where Michael draws on the roof. She's loud, she's opinionated, she's passionate. And she really seems to be about something. She's not just an ethnic joke.Like all bars, there are lots of colorful locals there, plenty of dangerous ones to be sure.Michael tries to score free drinks with his art. But that's all he tries to score Michael's no ladies' man and he knows it. He's a deep, sensitive, skilled artiste. And a sitting duck for some of the louder, tougher guys who make up the city.It doesn't help matter that he's a virgin and everyone knows it. At one point, some greasers try to hook him up with a loose woman who's eager to have it with a guy who's so fresh and green. Although this leads to a disaster. Even his own father tries to hook him up. Now there's a true loving father for you.Michael has an eye for Carol (many people at the bar she tends do), not because he's dying to get laid like nearly every other male. But he seems to genuinely feel something real for her. When she offers it up to him in gratitude for a favor, he faints. He wants her, but he's just not ready.Ida is fussy and over-protective of her son, just like a mother hen. Or rather a Jewish mother. Angelo wants his son to be more of a ""man's man.""Like all of Bakshi's films, this contains a lot of graphic violence and sexual images, as well as caricatures in the ethnic vein.But surprisingly, in the strangest way, it contains real heart, as well as some sweetness. The relationship between Michael and Carol has to be seen. Bakshi could've made her just an archetype like everyone else and he didn't. She's just as developed and human and relative as dear Michael is. These two deseve one another.""Heavy Traffic"" is wildly imaginative and thrilling in all it's glory. Like ""Being John Malkovich,"" we actually feel like we're inside the author's head rather than his film. This truly ranks as Bakshi's best. He deserves more credit for this than ""Fritz The Cat.""How much of all this take place in Michael's mind and how much of it takes place in his reality? Maybe they're one and the same. Maybe not. Maybe we're supposed to figure it out. It up to us. Just like Michael's life is up to him.The characters in the city are so damn cartooniSH and erratic already, they transfer them into cartoon characters without losing anything in the translation.Bakshi doesn't paint a pretty picture of the city and it's locals. But then again, he never has, has he? That's one of the things he's known for.But that's not the only thing. Let's hope that when he goes... he'll be remembered for a lot of things.Especially this one. It is... not only his best, not only one of the year's best... but of the best.by Dane Youssef",N/A
1138799,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for what it was: a piece of escapism; an action-adventure movie.Having read some of the other reviews, I see quite a bit of bashing for its lack of ""realism"". Well, ""Star Wars"" wasn't very ""realistic"", either, so I guess I don't understand that criticism.We have a single episode of political terrorism told from the varying perspectives of the participants, which I found very fresh and inventive.As we switch viewpoints, bits and pieces of the plot unfold in a creative manner. There's plenty of shoot-'em-ups, car chases, foot chases, bad guys (and politically incorrect ones, too, which was surprising), sympathy characters (a little girl in jeopardy)... the production team really covered all the bases on this one.The actors were fine in their roles; Quaid, Whittaker, Weaver, Hurt... all did good work. There were some fresh faces who also pitched in to make this movie a fun watch.I have no problems giving this a solid four stars.",Vantage Point
812786,"Becky Sharp (Miriam Hopkins) is a vicious social climber with little regard for other people's feelings. She began as a poor girl, but lied about her mother's background to afford herself a spot on a prestigious finishing school. Her orphaned status leaves her at the bottom of the heap there, but she makes connections that bring her into society. Amelia Sedley (Frances Dee) takes pity on Becky and introduces her to her elite friends, but Becky stabs her benevolent friend in the back by stealing her husband's affections. She doesn't stop there; she uses men for their money on countless occasions and uses her skills to weasel her way out of every bad situation. Her deception is masterful.The cast is the main reason to see this film. The story is slow moving and sometimes difficult to pay attention to, despite the short length of the film. Hopkins is beautiful and adept at playing her ruthless part, and fans will find a way to love her in spite of the character's malice. Cedric Hardwicke, Billie Burke, and Alison Skipworth also star.This movie is notable as being the first feature filmed in three strip Technicolor.

178235,"""Brighton Beach Memoirs"", the first of Neil Simon's three autobiographical plays (the other two being ""Biloxi Blues"" and ""Broadway Bound""), sees Simon's alter-ego, Eugene Jerome (Jonathon Silverman) coming of age in 1930's Brooklyn as his family struggles to make ends meet, while worrying about what the imminent war will mean for their relatives in Poland.Of the two film versions of Simon's autobiographical plays that I have seen, I think ""Biloxi Blues"" is the better play/film. In ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"", Jerome serves largely as an observer of the action that is going on around him, not a participant, and as a result, it makes it difficult to identify or sympathize with him. This is a problem that I didn't find in ""Biloxi Blues"", where Jerome plays a more active role in the story (I think this is largely due to Jerome's age in each of these plays). Also, ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" has a certain staginess to it - not so much in the location (the action does move around a lot), but more in the way the actors behave and deliver their lines.Nevertheless, I did enjoy ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" very much. I have liked Neil Simon's work since I was five and this film didn't disappoint. It is a very funny film and the acting is excellent. Watch this, and see ""Biloxi Blues"".

986417,"Godzilla, if anything, is a conundrum to the rest of the monster genre. Sure, the following sequels in the Heisei Series and the Millennium series were corny, but the original Godzilla captured something that few monster/science fiction movies have been able to achieve. Godzilla was a reaction to one of the world's most memorable devastation. With man creating so much havoc, would nature find a way to retaliate? Thus, the Japanese create Godzilla to showcase just how destructive man truly became on August 6th 1945. Sure, Ishiro Honda could've just made a documentary covering the bomb's atrocities, but instead he and Toho created something that was much more lasting. As Roger Ebert once said about the film, ""It was the Fahrenheit 9/11 of it's time."" As a child, I never understood the message sent from watching ""King of the Monsters"", but as an adult seeing this original, it is amazing how hard the message hits home. Few if any monster movies sent a message along for such an adventurous ride.King Kong made you cry for the beast. Godzilla made you cry for the people. It showed a monster that had no remorse for its attacks. It was merely a creature lost in a civilization that it did not belong in. Godzilla represented something that was merciless and relentless all at the same time. This creature was not victim to the lady in distress like so many other monster films succeeded on at the time. The buildup for the creature was also artfully done. Much like King Kong, a lot of time is spent towards building up the creature and its myth. Given the special effects capability in 1954, the entire crew must be commended for an amazing job with set design and the suit. Obviously there are scenes in which the creature's head shape and body design change due to wiring or puppet work, but the main costume which stampedes the beach is still the best Godzilla suit to this day. Surely a guy in a costume cannot be menacing alone. Now a legend because of his bombastic themes, Akira Ifukube produces a menacing and yet simplistic score to really complement the monster. Much like John Williams's Jaws, Akira Ifukube creates a sound that really assembles the terror of the monster. From the stomping sound fx to the military battles, Akira's score is recognized just as much as the monster itself.The biggest problem with the latter sequels of Godzilla was the inclusion of the human actors and their sub plot. Most of the subplots bordered between mediocre and flat out embarrassing (Megalon, Monster Zero, Terror of Mechagodzilla). Although not Oscar worthy by any stretch, this story produces a question of humanity that no other films dare to expand. Can a person do good with something that is only meant for evil? The character Dr. Daisuke Serizawa is faced with a horrible decision when his newly created weapon is the only hope to destroy Godzilla. If he uses this weapon against Godzilla, the possibility arises that the weapon could spark others to create the same destruction. Much like reality and the creation of the hydrogen bomb, humans create these weapons and say that it is for an overall good. The film really explores that such an idea cannot exist.On top of all of these things is an entertaining movie. There is a reason that this film sparked a span of sequels rivaling only the 007 series. Godzilla will always remain one of my favorite childhood moments. The odd thing was Godzilla took you to a place outside of reality only to remind you of that reality. Like the Ogata states, ""You have your fears, which may become reality. And you have Godzilla, which is reality.""","Gojira / Godzilla, King of the Monsters"
1097764,"I remember when news first hit about Elton John's 60th birthday concert. I remeber nagging my father to have his friend who has always managed to score us tickets to great concerts work her magic for this legendary show. Unfortunately, we were not able to attned this show, and I remember being incredibly disappointed for weeks, especially since the live coverage.Fortunately, a dvd of the complete show was released and I snatched it up immediately. I was not allowed to open it until my Birthday, so I awaited patiently until the big day came. When it did, me and my dad watched it in our basement, on the new Plasma we had pruchased, and we were blown away by what we had missed.Right from the opening ""Sixty Years On,"" you instantly feel like you're there. You can defintiely feel the energy from the crowd, and the sound and picture quality is first rate. If you have a top quality sound system, I suggest playing it LOUD.As for Elton himself, he has simply never been better. His voice has darkened with age, and his top range is kaput, but he plays and sings better than ever. At a point in his career where he could easily do an entire show on autopilot, he sings these songs with more passion and fervor than he did 30 years ago. Even seemingly tired hits like ""Bennie And The Jets"" and ""Philadelphia Freedom"" sounds fresh and energized.The show's setlist is a solid mix of rare studio track and big hits. The first half is a veritable selection of rarely heard studio tracks that Elton has a ball dusting off, including ""Madman Across The Water,"" the chilling ""Where To Now, St. Peter,"" ""Hercules,"" ""Ballad Of A Well Known Gun,"" ""Holiday Inn"" and ""High Flying Bird.""The second half is a top notch menu of Greatest Hits, with a few surprises such as ""Levon,"" ""Honky Cat,"" (the first time in years it has been performed with a full band) and a thrilling ""All The Young Girls Love Alice."" Elton and his band are absolutely ferocious throughout, playing with a bite and energy not since Elton's 1970s' glory days.Disc 2 contains several bonus performances from 1970 to 2006, including a selection of New York based performances, among them a haunting performance of ""We All Fall In Love Sometimes / Curtains"" at a 2005 Madison Square Garden concert, as well as legendary performances such as his 1976 solo concert in Edinburgh and his phenomenal 1984 Night And Day concerts at Wembley Stadium.Overall, this is an absolutely thrilling concert dvd, especially for those unable to attned the real show.

1134414,"NICK MILLARD AKA NICK PHILIPS is an underground exploitation auteur who's been making flicks from the mid 60's up until now. Most of them are fetish erotic/porn but he also made straight up horror flicks like the CRIMINALLY INSANE series. The two ones that you can find on this awesome AFTER HOURS Triple Feature presentation along the great EASY ALICE, WENDY'S NAUGHTY NIGHT and SIV : A SWEDISH GIRL, belong  to the first category and if you're a serious Sleaze Hound, you just MUST get them.WENDY is about a depressed and bored rich girl who looses herself into a world of sex, money and drugs where feelings don't mean a thing. Basically, what you get is a lot of graphic sex scenes  : WENDY doing it with her ""wanna be writer"" gigolo lover or her maid or WENDY watching her family members having orgies and so on. The fetishism is always there, cream and dildos are being used for sexual purposes (obviously), leather boots are being licked...you know, fetish stuff. A lot of beautiful flesh and bodies are shown and indeed some scenes are very hot but overall it all feels sad. I won't spoil the ending for you, just know that it is definitely not your everyday skin flick and that it will live a bitter taste in your mouth when you'll be done with it.The same goes for SIV, even though it is much much less graphic and the fetish aspect is almost nowhere to be found. This one is about an unsteady young couple who receives an exchanged student from Sweden nammed SIV. They usually use those foreign students as sex toys and that's how it starts with this one. A first it's all about free love, threesomes and lesbianism. But eventually, SIV unwillingly puts them further apart and it's not long before all the characters loose their minds. Once again, the final scene is mind blowing and depressing, to say the least. Free love and drugs are not all good and NICK PHILIPS didn't wait until the early 80s or later (that flick is from 1971) to show us that. Like in most NICK PHILLIPS flicks, most of the dialogues are the couple's voices over : you just can't run from their sickening thoughts.Now let's talk about EASY ALICE... If there was only one reason to watch it (there are actually plenty ), that would be to realize how great Porn was back in the 70's and how lame and predictable it mostly is now. The plot is simple : it's a day and a night in the life of JOEY a san francisco's Porn king (the legendary JOEY SILVERA). We get to see him with his regular girlfriend CAROLE /ALICE (the lovely LINDA WONG, may she RIP) then during a shoot where he replaces an actor that went ""too hard on the girl"" (the awesome PAUL SCHARF). After he's done, he hangs out with PAUL. They first talk about who the best performer is while smoking drugs in Paul's flat(that scene alone is great),  then go out, get drunk, get thrown out of a bar,  and look for some girls. From there, it gets even more crazy. I won't say too much but it involves rape and some swingers including a peeping husband. We also gets to see what ALICE is doing while she waits for JOEY to come back. She does drugs but first and foremost she gets into a threesome. Enough said... That flick is awesome, the actors give great performances both naked and with their clothes on, the characters are believable and the women are beautiful ( did I mention that ANNETTE HAVEN also has a part in it ?). On top of that the photography is gorgeous, we see the real 70's SAN FRANCISCO with real crowd and real street shots. It feels real, it's groovy, it's EASY ALICE.The bottom line is : those three movies are not to be missed. If you're a true exploitation fanatic, they're simply essential. The transfers also are more than OK. So thanks to NICK PHILIPS and to the nameless EASY ALICE director(s) for being such geniuses and thanks to AFTER HOURS for releasing such gems.",N/A

1099143,"A stellar cast, consisting of Vanessa Redgrave, Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Natasha Richardson, Glenn Close and Meryl Streep,  is reason enough for watching ""Evening,"" one of those high-toned, slightly stuffy, intergenerational family dramas that is all about lost loves, wasted lives and missed opportunities, this time among the champagne-sipping elite of Newport, Rhode island.Redgrave stars as Ann Grant, a terminally ill woman whose dementia is leading her to reveal secrets on her deathbed that have been locked away in her memory for years.  Collette and Richardson play her two adult daughters who are able to glean only a few tantalizing nuggets about their mother`s past as they emerge randomly and still partially obscured from the fog of her delirium.  These scenes set in the present are intercut with those from the past, the 1950's in fact, when a young Ann (now played by Danes) fell in love with Harris (Patrick Wilson), the servant of her best friend, Lila (Mamie Gummer, who looks for all the world like a young Meryl Streep, who indeed steps in as Lila for the present scenes).  Lila also happens to be in love with Harris, but she is instead marrying Karl (Timothy Kiefler), mainly because his aristocratic pedigree mixes better with her family's blue blood (echoes of the much-better ""Atonement"" abound throughout).  Further complicating matters is Lila's kid brother, Buddy (Hugh Dancy), who appears to be in love with both Ann and Harris at one and the same time.Needless to say, much of this plays like a tony, high-class soap opera, but at least two of the characters manage to rise above the suds and fully engage our interest:  Colette's Nina, whose paralyzing fear of commitment and of making life-altering mistakes threatens to leave her a bitter, lonely woman; and Dancy`s Buddy, whose conflicted sexuality brings an unforeseen complexity and depth to the character.  Most of the rest of the characters are considerably less interesting, including Ann (both the one in the present and the one in the past) whose personal revelations are supposed to be the glue holding this overpopulated story together.  Harris is a particularly bland and uncharismatic figure for a man who is supposed to be such an irresistible magnetic attraction for at least three of the principal characters in the story.The burden of transferring Susan Manot's novel to the screen has fallen on the shoulders of director Lajos Koltai, whose metier seems to consist primarily of pretty landscapes, dusky lighting and tinkling pianos.  And yet, amid all the soap opera trappings, the movie has some important things to say about not just letting go of the past but of having the courage to move into the future.""Evening"" is decidedly a mixed bag as far as moviemaking and drama go, but the powerhouse performances (particularly by Collette, Richardson, Redgrave and Dancy) make for worthwhile viewing.",N/A

This coach's life and his teams will take you on an emotional spiral--UPWARD.""Believe In Me"" Coach Driscoll and his wife have no children even though they want one so adoption is considered.  The story sounds a bit like a girl's basketball answer to the boy's football story of ""Facing the Giants.""  Both are great and recommended.Being a Hoosier, and growing up in what the Indiana state calls ""Hoosier Hysteria,"" I find this a story very rewarding.Bonuses:  Violence equals only a donnybrook on the court.  The nudes in the shower scene show nothing.  Druggies are nonexistent.  Bottom line--it's a family film--and the girl's acting can play a pretty mean game of basketball, more like the girls of the 21st century.One goofy highlight to watch for: see girl's basketball being played by one team in dresses.  Now that's shocking!  You'll have to remote in reverse and see it again, not believing your eyes.  Funny!A good movie to play the week before the basketball season begins--year after year after year.",N/A
958666,"I love opera-classical and pop and rock and roll - all. I never would have guessed a group of four men in their 30's could have the trained and fantastic quality of individual voices, and blend them so very, very well so they sound like almost one voice. The songs are as varied and interesting as the way they are sung by this group of very talented young men. On top of everything else, they are good showmen, each with their own brand of charisma, good looks and style. This is the kind of music that I play when I want to relax or cheer myself up or both. Their music is invigorating and stirring, and many of the songs are tender, and the pure and lovely tones are both calming but also make me smile and feel the ""chills"" at the same time. I always looked at Simon Cowell as abit of a ""Scrooge"" of sorts, even when he was ""right"" about a singer on ""American Idol."" I was turned off by his cynical and abit arrogant demeanor. Fortunately, he picked a real winner with these four guys! Also, fortunately, these young men seem to be genuine, humble and very kind indeed, considering all of the women and men  of all ages who adore them and come to see them all around the world. I have introduced Il Divo to 4-5 of my friends who never before liked opera, and who now like me, feel that this group is truly very fine and has a huge career ahead of them. Bravo, and encore! A song for everyone in their repertoire. If you know a good voice when you hear it, you cannot help but appreciate Il Divo!",N/A
1071189,"Ironically, unlike in Don McLean's immortal song ""American Pie"" in which the music dies, it is in fact the music that killed Malcolm in the Middle. For though season 1 sold enough units to warrant a season 2 release, the cost of music clearances was so prohibitively high that Fox decided to scrap the project.Music was a big part of the show, and the songwriters and frequently music publishing companies have to be paid up front before any dvd release will be authorized and without the guarantee of how many will sell, studios frequently chalk such clearances up as a bad investment (as has been the case with Parker Lewis Can't Lose, too). In some cases they substitute cheaper tunes instead (see: WKRP in Cincinnati), but in the case of Malcolm, they probably figured the music was such a vital part of the show it couldn't be taken out.People frequently seem to think that just wanting a show to come out on DVD is all it takes. Unfortunately that is not always enough. R.I.P. Malcolm in the Middle.",N/A
150932,"Written by Oscar Wilde, as a comedy of manners and more's of his time, it's about deception and using aliases, creating a non existent brother (or so it seems) as an excuse for a gentleman named Jack to take numerous trips to London.  In actuality, the visitations are to young Cecily as Ernest.  A British cast lend respectability to a controversial subject along the lines of 'Dangerous Liasions.'Filmed in 1952, the costumes were beautiful in my beloved technicolor.  Michael Redgrave played the role of Jack and Edith Evans (very hard to understand) was Lady Bracknell who had been the same character on stage.  Margaret Rutherfolrd and lovely Joan Greenwood were also prominent in this odd story.When Jacks gets upset at complications due to his double live, he decides to let Earnest die a natural death.  A local school presented a reputable version and I must say hearing the British dialogue with a Southern accent enhanced the comedy of a serious matter.  Since Wilde never married, it is hilarious having two women contemplating marrying the same rogue.  Both are lovely, despite the age difference of Cecily at only 18 when the legal age is 35 and Jack at 28 years of age.  Twenty-eight years ago, a baby had disappeared in Miss Prism's handbag.  ""I will wait for you all my life.""  The vital importance of being earnest is that Jack really did have a younger brother, in the play called Algernon, whose Christian name was Ernest Moncrieff.

Even then although I found it slightly interesting, I wasn't a fan yet. Two wifes later I was. Yes it was the women in my life that truly helped me develop an appreciation for Doctor Who. It became evident that I missed his true benefit, relaxation. The Doctor more than anything is a great relaxer. He may even put you to sleep. I don't mean this in an insulting way at all. It's just that even if it doesn't have the best acting, effects, sets, et cetera, it still will be interesting and relaxing. The Doctor is something you can do something else and run in the background and listen and appreciate. I say this because we have watched the episodes so many times we pretty much know them by heart. Although I love Tom Baker and Peter Davison, and I enjoy Jon Pertwee and Sylvester McCoy, I can only take Colin Baker in small doses, and I don't have  much interest in Hartnell and Troughton in the Black and White episodes. If they sell the whole set at a far better price I might be interested, but at this kind of cost no way. I have gradually bought the ones we truly enjoy and am now getting all the episodes of the doctors we like until then. The individual episodes I have purchased are only mediocre picture and sound quality and they do not contain extras. If they are priced above $20 be sure it is more than one episode.

263195,"LITTLE LAURA AND BIG JOHN was one of the many indie quickies that once appeared as the bottom half of a Drive-In movie double feature way back when summer and youth seemed inexhaustible. Movies like this weren't really meant to be watched closely-- they were designed as wallpaper to the private activities of backseated teens all across the U.S.Make no mistake about it: this is clumsily put-together. LL&BJ; has the feel of a crude student film, and yet, what was originally meant as a cinematic trifle best forgotten over a slice of late-nite pizza has with the passage of a third of a century somehow gained in value. The story is loosely based on a real outlaw gang-- one that operated in rural South Florida in the 1920s. A half-century later, much of their stomping grounds remained as they'd been decades earlier. To now see the natural beauty we've since traded for pavement, strip malls and multiplex theaters is poignantly melancholic.The film's narrative songs, like ""Goin' to Jacksonville"" or ""Everybody Likes it Up at Raiford,"" are positively laughable. For ex-teen idol Fabian Forte, ""Big John"" was hardly a bright spot on his acting resume, while Karen Black managed to survive her ""Little Laura"" misstep unscathed. Several others appearing here define the word ""amateur,"" while many bit players were locals with zero acting experience.So, who should see this film? South Floridians, certainly. Karen Black fans, maybe. Anyone nostalgic for a reminder of the drive-in theater's last glory days, most definitely.Speaking of which, ELITE'sDRIVE-IN DISCS COLLECTIONis about as close as you can get to being at a drive-in movie.

When her mother finally kicks the bucket, two protagonists are fascinated buy her mangled tard-speak and child-like innocence.  The friendly neighborhood psychologist wants to observe her in a lab while the gentle country doctor wants to go all Gorillas in the Mist and observe her bathing in her own filth in the woods.

1059741,"As a child I was always fond of the tale of Robin Hood. He was very much the blue print of modern day super heroes. His bravery and benevolence had a profound effect on me so I was very interegd when I heard the BBC was making a new and modern version. After watching the first season I was pretty pleased with the direction that they decided to take with Robin. The basic outline has Robin returning with his man servant from the Crusades only to find his beloved home town of Locksley run by a corrupt sheriff. Robin has a choice, give in to the Sheriff and retain the lands owned to him or resist. Robin resists of course and take to the woods where he wages (non bloody) gorilla warfare on the Sheriff and his goons. Robin Hood is pretty entertaining but it goes get repetitive quick. Many episodes are the following, The Sheriff or Robin have a plan to screw the other over, One of Robin's men gets caught, Robin rescues them. The Sheriff gets mad,swears revenge. usually in that order. With that aside the show has some cool components that make it unique to other versions of Robin hood. Like Marian being the vigilante ""The Knight Watchmen"" and the constant back drop of the Crusades. Though the show often wanders into ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" like campy it still is very worth addition to the Robin Hood Mythos. check it out!",Robin Hood: Season 1

1157918,"A few years ago, I saw a movie called ""Hulk"". You probably remember this movie, even if you don't particularly want to.  It was Ang Lee's unbelievably awful attempt at a superhero movie, and chief among its many faults was the excruciating overuse of split screens.  Having been subjected to that abomination of a film, I have now reached the point where the very sight of a split screen is enough to make me feel as though I'm about to turn into the hulk myself.  I mean, it really just makes my blood boil, honestly.So, this is where Bruce McDonald's latest film, ""The Tracey Fragments"", comes in.  This is a movie that rivals and maybe even surpasses ""Hulk"" in the blatant overuse of this oh-so-dreaded effect.  However, I can at least see here that it was done with the intent of symbolizing the sort of stream of consciousness nature of the story and its main character, Tracey.  Still, regardless of whatever it's supposed to represent, or whatever artistic merit it may or may not have, it largely serves no purpose other than to be really distracting and really annoying.  Little tip for would-be filmmakers regarding split screens: Less is more, and none is even better.Fortunately, this movie does have a few redeeming qualities.  Obviously it doesn't need to be said again that Ellen Page is amazing, but well, I guess I did anyway.  She is fantastic as Tracey, a somewhat disturbed young girl from an extremely dysfunctional family who ends up on a surreal journey through the streets to find her younger brother, who has run away from home.  Her performance is perfectly gritty and intense, tempered with just the right amount of dark humor.  On its own, the story is compelling (albeit bizarre, and not without its flaws), but I think it's her stellar acting that (almost) saves this mess of a movie.  She always manages to bring so many different dimensions to every character, and here is no exception.Still, the story is not without its flaws.  It skips around chronologically, which isn't too much of a problem most of the time, although it does get rather disorienting more often than not.  The whole thing plays out like a mix between a weird dream and a bad acid trip, and it never really reaches any sort of satisfactory resolution.  In the end, the viewer is left with more questions than answers, and at a mere 77 minutes of runtime, it just feels like it was thrown together in a hurry.  Still, it does definitely have its moments, and it benefits from an excellent score by Broken Social Scene.But yeah, those damn split screens!  I don't know, it's a personal thing, I guess.  Ang Lee beat this effect into my brain until I really just wanted to ""Crouching Tiger"" kick him right in the face.  I for one hope this isn't going to be in a continuing trend in films.  They call it the ""comic book effect"", or whatever, but if you ask me, I think if you want the experience of reading a comic book, you should READ A COMIC BOOK!!!  Anyway, sorry for the rant, but if you can get around the overkill of this, you might find some enjoyment here.  It's a decent effort, despite its many flaws.",The Tracey Fragments

In doing so, he brings healing to them and to himself with his own problems.

1110702,"This is a very disappointing movie. The acting is barely passable, the filming is third rate at best, and the comedy sometimes looses its point.Ash Christian plays Rodney, the main character, a somewhat overweight high school student who happens to be gay and is looking for his first love. His best friend is a more obese girl called Sabrina, Ashley Fink. Rodney considers himself as a fat girl, just like Sabrina.There is Rodney's weird family; Sabrina's weird boyfriend, a Cuban refugee adopted by an African-American family; the weird Drama High School Teacher who poses himself as Liza Minnelli singing Broadway tunes in the local gay club; the weird British blond hunk school student (the only other gay kid in the school) who goes out with Rodney to school prom, but he is not interested in Rodney physically. I guess the word weird is stressed in most of the characters of this movie.I did not like this movie, it is stupid to me. I did not like the fact that Rodney looses his virginity to the school teacher at the end of the movie. And his obese friend is presented as a joke.

1120410,"It all really started back in the late 60's with what would eventually become a cult classic. A film-maker set out to do something that hasn't been, at that time, really seen on the silver screen.The film-maker was George A. Romero, and his film was entitled night of the living dead.It was, in essence, the birth of what is considered to be the `modern' style of zombie. Slow, virtually indestructible unless you destroy the brain, un-stoppable and insatiable.A single bite and you're doomed to rise as one of the undead to forever more hunt for the flesh of the living.Since that initial movie, there have been a handful of similar zombie movies. Romero is responsible for four. We've seen black comedy styles, in the form of the Return of the Living dead and the masterpiece that is known as Shaun of the Dead.And then there is Resident Evil - a zombie trilogy that is totally set apart from the others in the genre.Originally conceived as a video game, it quickly became a best selling franchise which spawned three movies to date. Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, and Resident Evil: Extinction.Each movie progressed the story a little more. The first movie was set in an enclosed environment, the Hive. The second dealt with the T-virus, the source of the zombie infection, escaping into the city above the Hive, Raccoon City. Hell, if I didn't live so close to a city called Moose Jaw, I wouldn't have been able to swallow that name.With the third movie, many years have passed. The infection wasn't contained in Raccoon City, it spread first across the continental United States, and then the rest of the world.Resident Evil: Extinction is a true post holocaust movie. The few remaining survivors travel, never remaining in one place for more than a short period of time. They salvage what they can from small towns and avoid the major cities because of the undead.The Umbrella corporation, the creator of the T-virus and the architect of the Apocalypse still survive, hidden in massive facilities all over the globe, trying to co-ordinate with one another to discover, if not a cure, a means to control the undead population so that they can one day return to the surface.Of course, Alice, the heroine of the first two movies is the key to this returning to the surface and the domestication of the undead population.But, enough spoilers for now.The movie was action packed. The combat sequences are quite well choreographed and intense. The survivors are hardened and know what needs to be done.The nice thing is to see the return of a couple of familiar faces from the second movie.There were the inevitable plot holes that one would expect in any movie, and without really giving anything away, such as how there could be hundred, nay, thousands of zombies surrounding a fenced in facility and NOT cause the fence to collapse under the sheer pressure of the bodies surrounding it.How dozens up dozens of zombies could fit in a single container...Things like that.They cut back on Mila's nudity in this one, upped the gore factor a bit, but not to the point you're watching another SAW or Hostil. Funny, I used that exact same line in another review.Over all, I personally found it to be the best of the three movies. I really enjoyed it. And, as one expects, they left it wide open for Resident Evil 4. And you know something? I wouldn't mind it.The rest of the review covers the two disk special edition DVD.Once again we're at that part where I comment on the special features included on the DVD. First and foremost, you have the commentary with director Russell Mulcahy, and writer / producer Paul W.S. Anderson, and producer Jeremy Bolt.There are five making of featurettes - Alice Vision:  Preproduction; The Big Bang: Shooting Resident Evil Extinction; Bigger, Faster, Stronger: The Undead Evolve; and Vegas Visual effects, and Beyond Racoon City: Unearthing Resident Evil Extinction.My personal favourite of all special features are of course the deleted scenes, of which we're treated to a whopping eleven scenes, and as usual have varying degrees of effect on the overall plot of the movie.There is also a very brief trailer for the upcoming CG movie called Resident Evil: Degeneration, which takes place seven years after the events in Racoon city.There is a preview for the Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles video game for the WII system, and a preview for Devil May Cry 4 game.Lots of great features, so check it out!4 out of 5",N/A
6143,"I remember catching Donnie Brasco in the theater and thinking it was stupendous back in 1997. The entire cast is as solid as Goodfellas ... or any other movie for that matter. Initially I held off from buying the Blu-Ray because I wasn't sure if the film stock of '97 would have all of the detail that high-def reveals, but this transfer is excellent. The few scenes that seem kind of soft are outweighed by the 99% of beautiful footage. I especially enjoyed the extra scenes added back into the film. I remember the theatrical release seemed to skim over Donnie's home life because there was so much story to tell about him infiltrating the mob. Now I see they actually had tons of footage of his marriage with Anne Heche's character. Normally extended versions have stuff that you think could have remained on the cutting room floor. In this case, every bit of it belonged back in the film. I regret that I didn't get to see all of that footage on the big screen, but now a high def at home is like having the big screen at your house. Like every other reviewer has mentioned Depp, Pacino, Madsen, Bruno Kirby and Anne Heche make the best cast possible. It's a must for any Blu-Ray library.",N/A

Its 1966 vintage gives it points, and while it's  not full-blown campy, it does take itself somewhat seriously despite the fact its premise is absurd!But --- when it comes down to it --- it IS fun watching them and their submarine get shrunk!  Part of the charge in this movie is the sense of claustraphobia it induces as you watch them go from the size of mice, to the size of ants, until they are finally microscopic and ready to be injected into the man they need to perform laser surgery upon!  Brain surgery!  As they are put in at one of the lower arteries which will bring them to their destination in the brain, they are suddenly thrown off track and will have to find a new way, via unexpected organs and more dangerous routes!  Meanwhile, one of the crew may be trying to sabotage the mission..Sound a little cheesy?  Part of the fun is seeing the different ""landscapes"" as they cross through different parts of the body (the heart, the lung, the inner ear!).  They're always equipped in diving suits whenever they go outside their submarine to battle white blood cells or whatever..If you go in with low enough expectations, you'll probably enjoy this film..  it's quaint, it's antiquated, a little surreal.. nothing offensive in it.

1108085,"For those who do not have the dvd and only seen this on Showtime, I can clear up some of your complaints about this episode.In the director/writer commentary, a major story issue was revealed. When this story was being developed the two teens (nowhere in this episode was it stated that they were in college) were originally young boys between the ages 8-13. That was changed due to how much work and overtime this episoe required and child labor laws would have made that impossible to do with kids.This was suppose to be a story about two boys that were pretty much geeks (or in Arjay Smith's character, Kerry, case a white geek dipped in chocolate). To a certain point that worked and didn't work. It took liberty with some of the things vampires do and rewrote the one thing they did-bite people. Instead they just rip necks and leave a open gap that doesn't heal or keep water down.It should have focused more on Kerry since it was implied that he came from a worst home life than Justin. While Kerry was forced to accept becoming a vampire, Justin fought it to the very end. Ironside was the comic relief and the ""father"" figure that both boys lacked.The ending flat out screams a sequel or a crossover with Angel, Buffy, Blade the Vampire Hunter, Morbius or Dracula.",N/A

The story is about a soldier-chick named Deunan Knute (Yes, it's a very wierd name, a lot of people have wierd names in the movie) and she resides in the barren wasteland of what was once Earth and during a heated battle she gets knocked out by E.S.W.A.T. members and gets taken to a city run by Bioroids (a.k.a. clones) called Olympus and becomes a citizen. It turns out her long-lost boyfriend Bryarios is the one who brought her to the city and since their time apart he has become a machine. During her time in the city she learns about several conspiracies and sabotages involving military personnel and counsel members. I'm not revealing anything else you'll just have to watch this movie. The main problem with this movie are some cheesy acting moments, but other than that there's really nothing wrong with this movie. The animation is gorgeous, the action is awesome, and the storyline is pretty good. If you like science-fiction you'll enjoy this movie quite a bit because it's really good. This film is essentially part action, part romance, and part thriller; an excellent combination.",Appleseed

742741,"Martin Luther was a passionate, truthful, scary, disturbed and corrupt man--a paradox of an individual if ever one has existed.  The Protestant Reformation is one of those defining moments in history which could never happen again if Luther had to go through the considerable torment of being it's vehicle: he was so neurotic, so unstable, so prone to indulging his own emotional whims in the name of God that one meeting with a vocations' director in the Catholic Church would have ended his religious career altogether.Stacy Keach is one of my favorite actors, and his portrayal of Luther as a man torn by conscience, madness, and an initial ruthless search for authenticity is to my mind the best ever filmed.  He exudes the manly nobility that Luther possessed and also the frightful disturbance which was ultimately his downfall.  One cannot help but be amused by the early scenes with his Augustinian superior, Johann von Staupitz, played by Maurice Denham with a kind of a quiet irony.  During prayer, Keach's Luther breaks out into sweats and constantly begs forgiveness for imaginary sins and both complains and boasts about the his gastrointestinal problems.  Cleaning the latrines was a matter of sheer agony for Luther: his mind was dominated by intrusive thoughts, consisting for the most part about feces and doubt about his faith.  What a combination!Fittingly, the entire film is narrated by a peasant who joined the revolts that Luther provoked with his break from the Catholic Church.  Never having had any intention of aiding the peasants or joining any kind of revolt against authority, he himself had a number of them slaughtered while they invoked his name against poverty and injustice.  Smearing blood on the tortured Luther's cassock, he says: ""There.  Now you even look like a butcher.""He serves as a kind of reminder that Luther's heroism consisted solely of condemning the practice of indulgences and nailing the 95 tenets to the door of the Catholic Church in Wittenburg. And that's all she wrote, folks: after that he became as bad as the wealthiest, most corrupt member of the Papacy.Luther's painful relationship with his father is driven home well by the exchanges between Keach and the always fantastic, red-faced Patrick Magee.  Expressing his disbelief in transubstantion, he seems less interested in being a skeptic than enraging the young Luther, chastising him for choosing the monastic life when he could have been anything else--something that would have made the family lots of money.Luther was a zealot: and like all zealots, he could be particularly cruel when he wanted to be.  At the end of the film, when the narrator/peasant wheels in the corpse of a peasant killed in his name, Keach's facial expression turns to stone and he instructs the peasant to take him out of his newfound ""House of God"".  Instead of consummating his original strain of thought and relegating Christ to the soul of each man without a mediator, he simply founded a new religion which on whose throne he sat.  (Uncomfortably, I imagine.)Fortunately for Protestant viewers, John Osborne elected not to include Luther's raging anti-semitism, a lot of which would later be recycled for the arrival of the Third Reich.An accurate and moving portrait of a tragic figure.",N/A
1057011,"The 165 one-hour episodes (45 in B&W;, 120 in color) of the frontier western ""Daniel Boone"" originally aired on NBC from 1964-1970. So this DVD set is the third of six seasons for this extremely popular baby boomer show.  The show itself may seem a little odd today due to an uncharacteristic emphasis on racial/ethnic diversity (insert Ed Ames as Mingo and NFL lineman Rosey Grier as Gabe Cooper). But the times were a-changing as the country tried to turn itself into LBJ's ""Great Society"" and network executives smelled an opportunity to cash in on the baby boomer's budding social awareness.The series moved between a domestic focus on Boone's family (Patricia Blair as wife Rebecca, Veronica Cartwright as daughter Jemima, and Darby Hinton as his son Israel) to ""one-with-the-wilderness""/""the British are evil"" themes. The series focused on Boone after he had moved to Kentucky.Daniel was played by Fess Parker who already had an established coonskin cap franchise from his mid-1950's Disney TV portrayal of Davy Crockett. Boone is played as an even tempered peaceful man who likes to chum around in the woods with Oxford educated Indians and runaway black slaves (see above), your basic 1770's flower child. Other than his confrontations with ""the man"" (represented by those nasty Redcoats) there is very little messy violence and lots of ""Little House on the Prairie"" moments.Cartwright, the most talented of the ensemble, is frustratingly underutilized. Particularly given that the most celebrated event in the real Daniel Boone's life was the rescue of his daughter and her two friends from Indian kidnappers.Cartwright bailed out after season two and was replaced by budding sausage king Jimmy Dean as Josh Clements, in the tradition Chester and Festus from ""Gunsmoke"".Then again, what do I know?

It is a *GOOD* thing that Amazon.com notes in the title that this is the 8th movie created for One Piece *beyond* the numerous manga and anime TV episodes. Thus, this is *not* a good starting point to begin with this series.That being said, the characters remain both heartwarming and humorous. The emphasis on the friendship and loyalty among the protagonists maintains the sense of strong relationships among the characters. The fight scenes were a bit too drawn out, though given the medium and the source material, this is perhaps to be expected. It would have been nice, though, if a bit more exposition had been included as to who the characters were, though fans of the series should likely already know the backgrounds and motivations.I give this anime film 3 stars.

142359,"If you've avoided purchasing 'Cinerama'-formatted widescreen DVDs in the past (because of the irritating lines indicating each camera, and often blurry images), you're in for a treat; ""How the West Was Won (Ultimate Collector's Edition)"" has all but removed the lines, and restored the depth of detail, richness of color, and superb stereophonic sound lacking in every previous edition. Add to this one of the most entertaining, informative Audio Commentary tracks I've ever listened to, and you have a DVD that is truly worth owning!Taking a moment to reflect on the Commentary...I am disappointed that no 'Making of...' video has been made, as ""How the West Was Won"", with it's stellar cast, legendary directors, and massive production, certainly deserves one. But the Audio Commentary makes a sincere effort to make up for it, offering information on the locations, how the extraordinary shots were created, and backstories about casting and the production. A surprising bit of HTWWW trivia: Did you know that Bing Crosby was originally slated to narrate the film, with Spencer Tracy to portray Ulysses S. Grant? (The reason Tracy switched to narrating isn't explained in the Commentary, but I am familiar with what happened; Tracy collapsed at his home, prior to filming, and had to be rushed by ambulance to the UCLA Hospital; under doctor's orders to rest, he was unable to perform in a role, but still wanted to participate in some manner, so Crosby, graciously, gave up the narration to him). A health issue created another change, as well; Dimitri Tiomkin, the contracted composer of the musical score, broke his leg, and had to be replaced by Alfred Newman, who did a magnificent job. Another surprising fact: Hope Lange was originally cast to play George Peppard's wife, with a long subplot revealing she was Henry Fonda's daughter, first seen working as a showgirl at the railroad camp, where she was courted by both Peppard and Richard Widmark. Despite some scenes being filmed, it was decided the subplot took too much time from the main storyline, so her scenes were cut, and reshot to remove any reference to her, with Carolyn Jones cast in a far shorter version of her role, for the final sequence of the film.Much more is included in the Commentary, which really encourages a viewer to watch the film at least twice!The third DVD in the collection (the first two discs are of the film, itself), is devoted to a long history of the Cinerama process, from it's roots during the silent era, it's value during WWII as a training tool, the spectacular, and once, tragic, Cinerama travelogues, through the decision to scrap the 'three-camera' process in favor of a less difficult 70mm 'single-camera' process (HTWWW would be the last film using the original format), and it's ultimate demise, in favor of less costly formats. As someone whose first Cinerama experience was the 'single-camera' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", the documentary makes me wish I'd experienced the superior 'three-camera' films, with full stereophonic sound, on a giant curved screen!Lots of reproductions of original release promotional materials are included in the package, as well, which are fun to browse through, while you're watching the film.Entertaining, educational, fun...""How the West Was Won (Ultimate Collector's Edition)"" is all this, and MUCH more!",How the West Was Won

676989,"Some movies are just too wild, too rambunctious, too drunk on movieness to be comprehended in a normal theatrical run, and Baz Luhrmann's MOULIN ROUGE is one of the latest models.It's impossible to imagine what the ticket-buying viewers of this attention-deficit meta-musical were expecting, but chances are it wasn't what they got: an in-your-face, anachronistic debauch so absurdly designed and festooned with frippery it makes any Madonna road show look like a game of three-card monte. Even if you've seen and survived Luhrmann's ROMEO + JULIET, you've never seen anything like this before. It's the Hollywood equivalent of a shaken-up case of canned champagne.In the theater, the film came at you like a volley of cannonballs, and even in the back row you could get whiplash. At home, Luhrmann's wacky pyrotechnics will be more easily digested -- the DVD format might be the only way to make the world safe for this movie.Ostensibly set at the turn of the century in Paris, when the titular nightclub was gaining eminence, MOULIN ROUGE revolves around the doomed romance of consumptive star Nicole Kidman and penniless writer Ewan McGregor (and revolve it does, at 100 rpm). Luhrmann edited the movie in a full-blown montage fever, mixing in contemporary songs (by Elton John, Nirvana, Madonna, et al) and jumbling fantasy and reality so that, in the end, it isn't a movie so much as a speed-rock daydream of tragic love, musical impertinence and smiling moons.Make sure to rewind often, because there'll be tons of stuff you'll miss (including a TITINIC dig); at the very least you'll never be able to listen to ""Your Song"" the same way again.",N/A

The interaction between Reynolds and Deneuve borders on hilarious; when they're trying to be serious. Seriously.It must have been that period of time when acting was different.

189849,"Having been sealed for centuries, an evil leprechaun is unleashed. Setting a foot a campaign to regain all his 'lucky gold coins'. Easier said then done, his gold coins have been scattered a bit. In an act of revenge and remaining dormant for years this creepy little bugger is out to (oh my) kill!Scare factors are low, but the eeriness lingers. Leprechaun makes for one scary looking slasher on the loose. Jennifer Aniston snagged a lead role in the film, only to have this be one of her more forgotten roles (typecast Friends anyone?!). The setting is a 'middle of nowhere' location, we've all been their. Creepy looking house in 'the middle of nowhere', with little to do and land that just grapples the surroundings.One of the worst places to be with a killer on the prowl. The movie follows the slasher guidelines relatively well as it maintains the 'final  girl'. The film depicts a father with two kids, a worker interested in the fathers daughter, and an autistic fellow who's child like nature causes more trouble then his innocence would seem to carry.Overall what else can be said about the film? Not the greatest scare, a bit slow paced, the quality is a tad low, but it's still a cult classic. Leprechaun is a decent flick, I recommend finding it on your television or maybe a rental.

589729,"Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York is hugely ambitious.  He attempts to tell the story of the origin of the country in a violent, unceremonious bloodbath.  This is a wonderful film even for its flaws.  Just as my heading says, it is a near masterpiece.  The flaws are there, every reviewer will tell you this.One of the problems with the film is the character's motivations.  Amsterdam returning to avennge his father's death is perfect, but some of his actions seem faulty.  He appears to be fickle for no reason at times in the film.  Johnny (played by Henry Thomas) is the same way.  He betrays his ""friend"" for no other reason than to drive the plot forward.  I could go on in detail about the miscuses of other characters, touching on Diaz's lack of pickpocketing after it served its purpose for the storyline but I'll move on to what I liked about this movie.For one, it's absolutely beautiful, the sets, the lighting, the shots, everything.  The recreation of Old New York is magnificent.  I can't imagine why (COUGH*Harbey Weinstein*COUGH) the Academy did not award Dante Ferretti and Martin Scorsese for this wonderfully designed film.  The cinematography is just as excellent, with the scenes popping, figurately and at times literally, off the screen.  The colors are vibrant and exuberant, the buildings the pefect shade.  It looks remarkable.Another strong point is its absorbing power.  Once the story gets going, you just watch, amazed at what a great job Scorsese did.  It's not without its pacing problems, but it does a great job of keeping you entertained.  The last thirty minutes is when everything falls apart though.  The grand draft riots has no buildup.  It occurs, which, if it had happened at any other point in the film it would have been all right, at the end, when you need a dynamic ending to push the film into the epic stratisphere.A near masterpiece that, in the future, will be remembered as one of Scorsese's greatest accomplishments, probably right belowMean Streets (Special Edition),Taxi Driver (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Raging Bull (Special Edition)andGoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)and in the same company withThe King of Comedy,The Last Temptation of Christ - Criterion Collection,The Age of Innocence, andCasino (Widescreen 10th Anniversary Edition).Now, for the DVD specs.  It features a great and informative comentary from Scorsese.  It must be heartbreaking talking over a truncated version of one of your most personal projects.  Two desing featurettes: Costume and Production.  A Discovery Channel documentary on the History of the Five Points, some other Five Points information and U2 ""The Hands that Built America"" (Golden Globe ""Best Original Song"" winner) video.Like stated, it's a near perfect film from one of America's greatest working and overall directors.  It's not a must see, but it's real close.  The violence may be a little unnerving but it's definitely needed to tell a story like this.  I hate the fact that the film's split over two discs but this still earns a high recommendation from me.Highly recommended.",N/A
1061096,"I have been a huge fan of Edie Sedgwick for the last fourteen years. I was very excited when I heard that a ""real"" studio was actually going to try to make a biopic about Edie. That excitement began to wane when reports that actual Factory cohorts thought the idea of the film itself was disgusting. Turns out that the old Factory crew was spot on. This movie couldn't be further from Edie's actual life.Having poured over Edie's classic biography (Edie: An American Girl), it is more than apparent that the filmmakers took ""artistic liberties"" to new heights. What they couldn't find to be true, they made up. Timelines don't always make sense and people who weren't even that involved in Edie's life take center stage. That said, Sienna Miller's portrayal of Edie is quite good. In fact, the only redeeming quality in the movie is Miller's spot on impersonation of Edie - the girl did her research. Too bad the script (which was presumably written by a few people) wasn't as well researched.My real problem with this movies lies with one thing - the character ""Billy Quinn"" (who is simply credited as ""musician""). Hayden Christensen portrays ""Quinn"" as a thinly veiled Bob Dylan-esque musician who tries to show Edie the shallowness of the Warhol Factory and ultimately becomes the thing that tears Edie and Warhol apart. Anyone that read anything about this film before (or after) seeing it knows that Dylan repeatedly denied being involved with Edie and threatened to sue if he was portrayed in the film. Instead of getting rid of the character completely, the director instead decided to keep him, give a new name and carry on. I don't believe anyone was fooled or didn't guess whom Christensen was actually playing.While I understand that biopics are rarely full of all truths, there is simply  no proof that Edie was romantically involved with Bob Dylan. In fact it has been suggested that any sort of romance between Edie and Dylan was probably more of a one-sided figment of Edie's imagination. Whatever the real story is, I found the whole concept of the character to be uncomfortable. I suppose the filmmakers thought that Edie having an affair with the notoriously private Dylan was much more interesting than the real life affair she had with the less famous Bob Neuwirth (Dylan's best friend at the time).Edie's real reason for leaving the Factory had more do to with her drug use and the fact that she felt she should try to shoot for real stardom. Instead, ""Factory Girl"" portrays Edie as a somewhat helpless girl who is caught between two powerful men from two very different worlds, both of which she wants to belong to. As flawed as Edie was one thing is certain, she did what she wanted when she wanted. Her decision to leave the Factory was most likely her own (she stated at various times that she wanted Warhol to pay her for her work in his films) and likely wasn't based on the affection of any man. The fact that the filmmakers sunk to such depths to get the story they wanted, no matter how untrue it was, is what is the most insulting. I'd rather no movie be made about Edie than the lies and fabrications that made up ""Factory Girl"".If you're interested in finding out more about Edie, don't rely on this movie. Instead, read the few books that cover her life and go on facts, not rumors or hearsay. Edie might have been a cultural footnote, but everyone deserves to have their story told in the most honest way possible. ""Factory Girl"" fails on all fronts and only goes to show that as years go by, people think they can just reinvent history to suit them.The sad thing is, a few of Edie's family members (her widower, who appears as a taxi driver in one scene, and her sole surviving brother Jonathan) participated in the film. That, in and of itself, actually lends some credibility to a movie than deserves none whatsoever.",N/A

I had read ""Hell House"" and I was just so amazed at the wide scope he could take in the horror genre.When I heard they were making or re-making ""I am Legend"" I was really excited.  When I read that they were having it take place in New York I become a little suspicious as the book takes place in L.A.  What other changes would they make to the original story?Well it turns out the New York setting worked quite well.  Seeing Will Smith hunting deer on Broadway or driving down the empty streets of America's most populated city had a great dramatic effect.Much of the original book was changed however, some for better and some for the worse.  Most notably was the ending.As others have pointed out, the first half of the film is just so powerful, packed with the shock of seeing what the world has become after this vampire virus spreads as well as the emotional plot turns.The second half of the film seemed somewhat rushed to me.  Now I have no way of knowing in what order they shot the scenes but I felt that maybe the writing could have been better for the second half of the film.  For instance, and this may be a slight spoiler, the scene at the pier at night, I thought it would have worked perfectly if they had stuck more to the book and had the ""civilized"" vampires rescue him from the other vampires like in the book instead of how they did it in the movie.  But that's another part of the book they left out entirely; the different classes of vampires that sprang up.  Yes I know that Matheson never actually calls them vampires but we all know that's what they are.Overall, this is a good film and I intend to actually buy it when it comes out on DVD.  There are few apocalyptic stories that I think pull it off and this is one of them.  The visual effects for the transformed New York are stunning though the vampire creatures could have been better.Will Smith proves in this film that he's not just an actor who is suited for comedy or light drama.  His role in this is somewhat similar to ""I, Robot"" though so much of the film depends on him and he pulls it off quite well.",I Am Legend

74697,"Very impressive movie by Adrian Lyne, who apparently was involved on a very personal level, as unfortunately his other work isn't exactly world shattering, but this one makes up for it all. Although it wasn't exactly a maverick move in 1990 to make a Vietnam film, this is certainly one of the most interesting ones on the subject. This is maybe a bold statement in view of the company this movie is in concerning this subject matter, but I do think it not to be an exaggeration.What makes this movie so special? It sheds light on America's involvement in the war from an angle that is not often seen: the use of its own soldiers for experiments in chemical warfare on the one hand (macro story) and the thoughts, feelings, memories, dreams of the future of a veteran (micro story) on the other hand, which is a dramatically very effective combination, that really pulls the viewer in, especially if the main protagonist is performed so magnificently as is being done here by a very young Tim Robbins.What makes the movie even more special is the structure, that gives shape to the story, causing the viewer in, what we would now call ""Donnie Darko"", fashion to be hurled through space, time and seemingly parallel realities, dipped in a horror genre type nightmarish atmosphere, which is pretty disturbing. As in Donnie Darko the viewer is repeatedly misdirected and so I've seen on many occasions that various viewers were equally moved as well as confused while looking at the credits rolling by, all the while enjoying the beautiful soundtrack which the movie can boast as well.One can think of at least three different interpretations concerning the title of the movie, the first one being an obvious reference to the main protagonist's name Jacob Singer, the other two requiring some bible knowledge and patience until watching a major plot change halfway through the movie, that I can't expand upon without giving away crucial plot points. But anyway, who is this mister Singer, apart from the fact that he in view of what I stated earlier obviously is in Vietnam? In the opening scene we see him deployed there with his comrades in arms, having a, what seems to be a relaxed, break before what Sarah Palin would call a ""surge"". a kind of chilling on the battlefield I suppose. Suddenly explosions all around and the sound of helicopter flyby's, either panicking the soldiers or making them sick and throw up. Jacob runs but soon is on the receiving end of a bayonet. End of movie ... nah, next thing we see him wake up in a subway car, ah, so it was all a dream of that period and the war turns out to have ended a number of years ago. After his return from Vietnam Jacob gave up on college as, so he explains, ""... didn't want to think anymore after the war"", and drives a mail van. Still a bit in a daze over his dream he looks around in the car and notices his fellow passengers, a homeless person sleeping it off and a woman who keeps staring at him with a penetrating look who he asks whether ""Bergen Street"" stop has come and gone or not. The woman just looks at him strangely and no answer is forthcoming. As luck would have it the next stop turns out to be just the one he needed. As he's getting out and passes the homeless person, in a flash Singer sees a kind of wormlike creature quickly pulling back inside the man's coat. Quite disturbed by this he gets off the subway.Next unpleasant surprise is the fact that the exit of the station is locked off and he will have to cross the track to try and get out on the other side. As he's walking across a new train is approaching but as it is unclear which track it's going to switch to, Singer is in a tough spot. At the last possible instant he leaps and the subway car passes him at a hair's breadth. As the train flashes by, in the cars we see a radiant white light and vague human shapes standing at the windows all looking out with at its end an unrecognizable figure which stares at Singer as the train disappears into the dark.The atmosphere in this very strong opening is typical for the rest of the movie and we see how Jacob's life spirals down in an increasingly threatening and frightening way, with intermediate flashbacks to Vietnam as we see what happened to Jacob after the bayonet encounter. He loses his grip on reality more and more and has increasing difficulty in separating the real from imagination, past and present. A phone call from fellow veteran friend who desperately wants to see him and in the subsequent meeting turns out to suffer from the same type of experiences Singer is having. This starts off a series of discoveries into a dark affair, connected to their time in Vietnam.There's a number of fascinating characters in this movie, first and foremost Jacob's chiropractor Louis, magnificently performed by Danny Aiello.Naturally there's a whole lot more to this movie but that I wish for the viewer to discover. I've seen this movie many times with different people and each time it strikes me how much it moves them without fail.",N/A

739673,"Back in the early '90's I was a big fan of the 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys' series. When I learned a spin-off series titled 'Xena: Warrior Princess' was to be released in '94 I was certain it was going to be a big failure. Looking back via hindsight I can only guess that my reasoning for such a prediction was probably something like the extreme possibility of over saturating the audience with too much of a good thing. Now all I can say is boy was I wrong!  They knew exactly what they were doing, taking everything that worked from Hercules, including cast and characters, and added a very heavy dose of darkness that was a perfect counter-balance to the lovable good guy, harm no one if possible attitude portrayed by Kevin Sorbo (i.e.: Hercules).If there was ever a person born for the express purpose of playing a particular role it has to be Lucy Lawless in the starring role of Xena. Her physical appearance, beautiful and expressive face, high energy and uncanny ability to be believable as a heroine one moment and the most evil  villianess the next is truly remarkable. The addition of Renee O'Connor as side-kick Gabrielle was also a gem of a find. Cute, adorable and chatty, she's the perfect compliment to the more sullen and introspective Warrior Princess.This is a wonderful beginning to six amazing and unforgettable seasons of television viewing. There have been many memorable television shows through the years, but none that have even come close to creating and sustaining a world so mythic, believable and entertaining. That's the legacy of 'Xena: Warrior Princess'.Postscript: I know what you're thinking. After such praise why only -4 Stars-? Why, because it got even better in forthcoming seasons! I had to leave some margin to allow for improvement didn't I?",Xena: Warrior Princess - Season 1

1149897,"I didn't hate this version of Room With a View.  Yes, I have seen the Merchant Ivory version.  Yes, I have read the book. Although I thought the cast of the Merchant Ivory production was magnificent, I actually like a great deal of the cast in this adaptation as well, so I was prepared to view this with an open mind and not hate it instantly because it wasn't Merchant Ivory.  I have seen several of this cast (Cassidy, Cusak, Thompson, Spall) in other productions and thought they were wonderful.  The aspects of this production I found most disappointing were the script and direction.  I found the dialogue to be lackluster, and the interpretation of some of the characters (primarily Cecil) just plain dull.  I have admired some of Davies' adaptations in the past, but his more recent works seem to have an underlying conceit in them that I find distasteful, as though he would deign to ""improve"" the works of the authors he is adapting.  Davies is, indeed a gifted and talented man, but is he really so lofty that he feels capable of enhancing Austen, Forster, and Waugh?  He had a wonderful cast of people to work with for this adaptation, but their performances were never going to reach the stellar level they were capable of when the script they were given to work with was second rate.  I know there was a time limitation, but the story was just diluted and unnecessary additions were made (the additional meeting with the gig driver, George's death, etc)that seemed to serve no purpose other than to needlessly outrage the audience.  I don't understand why Davies feels the need to shock a response out of his audience, rather than impress them with quality.  That cheapens the whole production.  This production wasn't awful, but if could have been so much better.",Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View
12029,"The remastered edition of ""1776"" is near perfect.  THe audio is crisp and clear, as is the ALL of the video. THe commentary track is interesting and insightful into not only the historical accuracies (many sections of the dialogue) and factual compromises (Martha Jefferson never went to Philadelphia, Thomas went to her), but also the politics of the Nixon era that scrubbed (at Nixon's request)and nearly lost for all time (at Jack Warner's direction) the ""Cool Considerate Men"" number that closes the stage version's first act.  Fortunatley, the number was recovered and (as with the laser disc release) assumes its rightful place in the film.  My only quibble with this edition is that, unlike the laser disc version, the second half of ""Piddle Twiddle and Resolve"" is missing again.

682627,It is all said in the other reviews. I just want to add weight to the encouragement to try this movie-even if the cricket sounds boring.I'm not a  sports fan but I found the cricket in this rivetting as it is more about personalities and dramatic tension.Aamir Khan is superb but then so are all the Indian actors. The British are a mix: some good and some having an odd inflection to their English.A.A. Rahman's score was engaging enough that I bought the CD. There are some catchy tuned but not in an 'in your face' kind of way' (though I like those too). The dancing is a bit more to the traditional.It is a thoughtful political piece as much as anything about a clash of cultures and some of the dubious styles of British governance that I know are well-documented elsewhere (though I know the British weren't all-bad nor the local rulers all-good as you almost have stereotyped here).THis is well worth seeing and stays with you.

812301,"Have you ever watched a show so powerful that you can't wait until the next episode? Among a string of wonderful new shows on the FX Network, Nip/Tuck was a jewel! It is edgy, brilliant and definitely well written. And I love the fact that there is always some plot twist that was completely unexpected.For an hour (probably more like 35 to 40 minutes) you enter a world the superficial world of brilliant Plastic Surgeons Sean McNamara and Christian Troy. Beginning each consultation with ""tell me what you don't like about yourself"", they set out to fix or improve those things that their clients hate about themselves. Everything it appears can be fixed with the services of a fine surgeon and a scalpel.Sean (played by Dylan Walsh) is the more talented Surgeon whose life appears on the surface to be perfect (2 kids and a loving wife, Julia). Conservative and straight laced, Sean is the perfect alter-ego to sex crazed Christian.  Christian (played by Julian McMahon of Charmed) is the more sophisticated of the two, but finds himself ""bedding"" one woman (and sometimes two) in every episode. Having one meaningless sexual relationship after another, appears to interest him more often than a complicated surgery.  Liz, their anesthesiologist and friend, is constantly trying to show Christian the error of his ways, while assisting them both by performing some very complicated and creative surgeries. Soon you will find that the creative and wonderful storylines have pulled you into the dazzling world of McNamara-Troy, and you have simply fallen in love with this wonderful show, and looking forward to every episode.

351976,"Detour is one of the all-time great examples of film noir.  The use of shadowy black and white cinematography, a star-crossed protagonist, a femme fatale, a cynical voice-over narration and ambiguous morality can almost be used to define the Film Noir Genre.  Brought together by legendary director Edgar G. Ulmer in only a few days and on a diminutive budget, Detour's B-Film sets only add to both the film and the genre, a true testament to the mastery of Ulmer.Al Roberts (Tom Neal) makes a series of bad choices that bring him to a very low point in his life.  Vera (Ann Savage) plays the quintessential Bad Girl.  Their witty repartee and in truth, much of the dialogue throughout is a main attraction of this film.

There is noticable camera work (subjective angle shots by the psycho killer) that was adopted by John Carpenter four years later in Halloween. Halloween is two stars superior to this movie. Can I recommend it? Only if you are a huge fan of horror from all time periods and do not expect too much from this film. Don't get me wrong. Its not a bad movie, just not as great as many of the reviews I see glorifying it. You will have to decide on your own about whether its worth a purchase or not.

Not to mention that this is one of the (if not the?) best reviewed movie of its genre.  Let's just say the movie itself is great.Now, on to the Blu-Ray review.  When I first bought into the Blu-ray format, I told myself that I'd stick to buying the new releases primarily, thinking ""how good can they really make older movies look without a digital source?""  Having said that, I decided to pick up The Shining, mainly because I love the movie and the only other copy I own is the VHS tape.  In one word: WOW.  I don't know if it's because I skipped the SDDVD step and went straight from VHS to Blu-Ray, but it really is like watching the movie for the first time.The picture is stunningly crisp and detailed-- there are innumerable details that I never saw/noticed in the SD version and the colors and contrast are phenomenal.  The flesh tones are even and consistent and they've really shaken that washed-out look of the previous versions.  I felt like I was ""inside"" the Overlook Hotel, and this makes the experience of the film all the more unsettling and terrifying.There is definitely a bit of noticeable grain here and there.

1157947,"""Autumn Hearts: A New Beginning"" is a poignant movie that deals with three survivors of an internment camp during WW II. Though the pace of the movie is slow, it flows well and the story of three 'damaged ' individuals is poignantly told. The fine acting by a stellar cast makes this a riveting watch.Susan Sarandon plays Melanie, a 50-something year-old woman who lives in Quebec with her retired college professor husband, David [Christopher Plummer], son Benjamin and young grandson Timmy. Melanie is an emotionally-disturbed woman, a legacy from her traumatic childhood experiences during WW II. As a child, Melanie was sent to the transit camp Drancy in France, and never saw her parents again. She meets a young Irish boy, Christopher [Gabriel Byrne] and both youngsters are taken under the protective wings of an older young man, Jakob [Max Von Sydow]. The three form a life-long bond even after the end of the war.Fast forward 35 years later - Melanie has invited Jakob to spend some time with her, and to her surprise, Christopher tags along too. Painful memories are stirred up - and things are made more awkward and difficult given that Melanie's husband David is resentful of the two visitors and jealous of Melanie's closeness to Christopher. The rest of the story deals with how the three survivors make peace with their past, especially Melanie and answers whether closure is something they can achieve.The acting in this movie was top-notch. Susan Sarandon credibly portrays a survivor who is wracked by guilt [common amongst many survivors of the Holocaust] and who is extremely determined not to forget. Her pain is so palpable and yet frustrating because we can see how her pain and determination to live in the past has taken a toll on her family life. Max Von Sydow is amazing in his portrayal of a selfless man who sacrificed his very happiness and life for the sake of his young charges - being shipped off to Auschwitz, and then enduring decades in Stalin's Gulag before finally resuming some semblance of a normal life. His most striking dialogue in the film is the phrase ""If you ask me if I believe in God, I ask you does He believe in me?"" is profound indeed.Gabriel Byrne's Christopher is no less compelling. He plays a man who still holds a torch for his first and perhaps only love, Melanie and how he too has been traumatised by their camp experiences, though he chooses to dwell on the positive [meeting Melanie] rather than the bad. Christopher Plummer is also credible as the disillusioned husband who struggles to come to terms with his wife's emotional instability, choosing to distance himself rather than extend comfort.All in all, I loved this movie - it deals with the difficult themes of 'survivor guilt' and the emotional toll on the survivor's family. Yet, the movie explores these themes without actually showing any gruesome footage of the actual wartime experiences. Instead the principal actors are able to convey this pain and emotional baggage through their facial expressions and dialogue delivery.The cinematography is breathtaking, and provides a vivid contrast to the deep pain and emotional scars within the three actors. The score is haunting and truly captures the emotions evoked by the movie. I highly recommend this to all those seeking a well-acted human drama.",Autumn Hearts: A New Beginning
386086,"Nana: My grandmother, Anne GillisThe star: George C. Scott was an icon; legendary American stage and film actor, director, and producer, perhaps best known for his Academy Award-winning portrayal of General George S. Patton Jr. in the film Patton.  He was, quite simply, one of the finest actors of his (or any other) generation.  An actor who often played gruff and harsh roles, Scott was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor for his portrayal in A Christmas Carol.Scott's interpretation of Scrooge is spot-on.  His Scrooge is a complex human being and as the story unfolds the viewer sees WHY he became so bitter and cynical in his old age, and for (perhaps) the first time an actor playing Scrooge successfully portrays the REGRETS the character has.  His Scrooge feels REAL.  He takes familiar dialogue and makes it seem spontaneous and fresh.  He face, his movements, his words, all convey the emotion the man feels - and he does feel.  His ultimate transformation seems believable: This is a man who has closed his heart to love to feeling, and finally realizes what he's lost.  Scott is brilliant as Scrooge.Ebenezer Scrooge: [Sitting under the bridge after the Ghost of Christmas Present leaves] ""What have I done... to be abandoned like this? What?""The Cast: The entire cast is wonderful.  No role is miscast.  In addition, many of the actors are British, so the mannerisms and accents and use of language seem natural.  The acting is believable, making characters in an all-too familiar story seem REAL and full of life.David Warner's Bob plays just the right balance of timid clerk and loving husband/father.  Susanna York (who will always be ""Lara"" to me), is pitch-perfect as Mrs. Cratchit.  There's a nice scene where Bob Cratchit and his wife kiss under the mistletoe and hug lovingly.  This version shows that that are not just parents but a couple who love each other very much.The Cratchit children are not overly sugary but just seem like nice kids.  I like when Mrs. Cratchit tells one of the children to go butter the brad and she adds, ""Thinly.""  Tiny Tim is sickly looking, but not overplayed as the over-the-top doomed child.Roger Rees as Fred is very good, and the casting directors actually made an effort to cast Scrooge's sister Fan and Fred resembling each other.  Rees's Fred is just a little too reserved for me, but that may be a directorial choice to contrast him with his Uncle Ebenezer.Frank Finlay (Marley's Ghost), performance is incredible; you really believe he is filled with regret for his lot.  Finlay plays the role as just a bit crazy, just a bit over the top emotional; which is perfect for Jacob Marley.The Ghost of Christmas past is wonderful; Angela Pleasence conveys just the right balance of teacher/reminder and clear contempt for Ebenezer.  What's interesting in this version is that the ghosts have obvious disdain for Scrooge - and aren't afraid to show it.  When Christmas Past is departing as Scrooge insanely screams, ""Leave me,"" she smiles wickedly.  But she also prods him, sometimes gently:[Christmas past and Scrooge are watching his past self dance with his great love, Belle:]Christmas Past: ""How long since you danced, Ebenezer?""Scrooge: ""Waste of time.""Christmas Past: ""You didn't think so then.""Scrooge: ""The was a REASON then.""GREAT writing.  GREAT characterization.  Honest regret over choices made and not made.Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present is exceptional.  He is full of life and humor, sarcastic when he needs to be, and he also doesn't hide his disapproval of Scrooge.  He is bombastic at times, commanding, powerful, and a man (ghost) on a mission.  He is enjoying his torment of Scrooge.  I get the feeling he really doesn't care whether Scrooge repents or not.[Scrooge, observing the Cratchit's meal:]Scrooge: ""It's a very small goose.""Christmas Present: ""It's all Bob Cratchit can afford.""And when the ghost reminds Scrooge of his ""decrease the surplus population"" comment he is positively venomous as he snarls, """"It may be that in the sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child!""  It's familiar dialogue but man, this ghost is seething when he says it.Throughout the film, many of the actors communicate with facial expressions rather than words.  A good actor can pull this off brilliantly.  There are many such examples in this film: Scrooge's look of confusion when he sees Marley.  Young Ebenezer's look of sadness and regret when he knows he'll never please his father.  And so much more.The film itself:Thee entire movie is VERY faithful to the original story.  It was filmed on location in Shrewsbury, England, giving it an authenticity not found in other adaptations.  The costumes are perfect.  The attention to detail is meticulous.  Nothing looks like a ""set,""  All the places - the homes, the markets, the offices, look real.  The scenes of commerce at the exchange, the frenzied shopping at the market on Christmas morning, the bustling city - it looks and sounds very real.The foggy, dreary London described in the Dickens story is very well created here.  The streets where Scrooge walks to his home are dark and creepy.The majority of the special effects are conveyed by traditional stage effects with smoke, and lighting.  It's all very effective.The scene at the when the horses and Marley's funeral carriage pass by - we see it but Scrooge doesn't - creepy.Marley's makeup, lighting and clothing -- all a deathly blue - is well done.The transitions from one scene to the next during the time-travel are unique to each ghost - the cap Christmas Past holds reflects each scene as we transition from one time to the next.  Christmas Present's torch bridges one sequence to the next scene, and Christmas future transitions each scene with a loud crash and brilliant flash of lightning.And in each of Scrooge's visions of the future, after he witnesses the scene the lights dim and only a spotlight effect remains on him - almost like standing alone on a stage.  It's a very effective presentation.  The Ghost of Christmas yet to come first appears as spotlight shines on him in the distance, and it is conveyed mostly through shadows of hands and hoods.  It's all very well done.Liberties with the story (all good):As Scrooge takes his cold gruel by the unlit fireplace, he sniffles, a reminder that (in the story) Scrooge had a head cold.I love it when Scrooge adds his own ""Amen"" to the Cratchit's Christmas prayer.We see several scenes of Scrooge conducting his commodity trading business at the exchange.  Scrooge is clearly recognized as a man of business and is deferred to as such, but a hard businessman with no compassion or room for negotiation.The Ghost of Christmas present doesn't age and fade away in this version - he laughs at Scrooge and abandons him outside in unknown territory.We finally meet Scrooge's father in this version - he's a cold man, a mean spirited old bastard.  He does not love his son -We learn that Scrooge's mother died giving birth to him and Silus Scrooge holds a grudge against his son because of it.  This makes the characters seem much more real.  Also, I think this is one of the few versions where Fan is older than Ebenezer.There are dozens upon dozens of memorable scenes in this film, but my favorite is the end -- in this version, it's clear that Scrooge is a man whose newfound joy is tempered by remorse.  Not only is his intention to make things right in the present and future, but to apologize for his past behaviors. His apology to his nephew is here an integral part of the story--it is heartfelt.  And it works.Scrooge: ""Well, I've come for three reasons.  The first is to beg your pardon.  [What I said about Christmas] THAT was a humbug, Fred.""He goes on to meet Fred's wife Janet and says, ""I, uh, I was in love once.  Can you believe that?""Janet: ""Yes.""Scrooge: ""But I had neither the courage nor the conviction that you two share.""He then reminds Fred how much he resembles his sister Fan and adds, ""I loved your mother, Fred.  For a time I'd forgotten how much.""And finally Scrooge says, ""My God forgive me for the time I've wasted.""Summary: An outstanding adaptation of the story with a perfect cast, believable, flesh and blood characters and meticulously detailed sets and streets.  A perfect Scrooge and a larger-than-life stage, an adapt ion that takes a very familiar story and makes it feel fresh, and real.  I HIGHLY recommend this Christmas classic.",A Christmas Carol VHS

548753,"This Blu-Ray edition of ""The Dirty Dozen"" is a big disappointment. I'm going to send this back to Amazon and wait for another upgraded version to be released someday.  The picture has acceptable high defintion sharpness for about a third of the movie. In the other two-thrids however, the scenes are obviously soft and blurry. I had read reviews on 2 Hi-Def websites that indicated this was the case but I decided to take a chance on this movie anyway because it is one of my favorites. The negative reviews on the other websites were to optimistic. The picture quality is even worse than they said. Not only does the picture become soft right before ever dissolve from one scene to the next, but many scenes between dissolves are also soft. The purpose of Blu-Ray  movies is to enjoy 1080p quality high-defintion and this movie fails to deliver. Compare this movie to a war movie from the same 1960s time period, the excellent Blu-Ray edition of ""The Battle Of The Bulge"" and see what real picture sharpness is supposed to look like.",N/A

When her boss threatens her she quits her job de-thorning roses at a plantation (for shipment to Costco?!), even though this spells economic disaster for her family. She bags her boyfriend Juan who's a loser, even though he got her pregnant and wants to marry. Then a ""friend"" advises her that she can make unheard of money as a ""mule"" who swallows packets of heroin and delivers them by stomach to New York City. The allure of money and adventure is too much, so Maria, her best friend Blanca, and a seasoned mule named Lucy, learn how to swallow 50-60 packets without gagging and find themselves on the next flight to the Big Apple. We're not surprised when custom agents grill Maria upon landing, or that a packet bursts in Lucy's stomach, but these are only the beginnings of bad outcomes for all. The power of this film include its understated tone and the realization that it's based upon way too many true stories. In Spanish with English subtitles.",N/A
916853,"This 1989-90 Season of the Bundy's is awesome and is even better than the first 3 seasons of this show, despite the unfortunate fact that this is the season when Marcy's husband Steve Rhoades(David Garrison) departs from the show in the Winter of 1990.I liked seeing Tiffany-Amber Thiessen on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN before her SAVED BY THE BELL days and BEVERLY HILLS 90210 days, since they showed Tiffany Amber Thiessen as a guest star before she was even famous along with the fact that nobody knew that Tiffany-Amber Thiessen was going to become a co-star on SAVED BY THE BELL and BEVERLY HILLS 90210 when she guest starred on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN as Bud's prom date(Heather McCoy).Therefore, seeing Tiffany-Amber Thiessen on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was almost like seeing some casts colliding between SAVED BY THE BELL and MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, since seeing Kelly next to Heather McCoy on the Bundys was almost like watching the casts colide between Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) and Kelly Kopowski(Tiffani-Amber Thiessen) along with the fact that Christina Applegate was the hottest and best looking co-star on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen was the hottest and best looking co-star on SAVED BY THE BELL.I also liked the episode when Al(Edward O'Neill) fantasizes about himself being a James Bond type character hero in the episode when Al, Kelly, and Bud go to Las Vegas to track down Peggy(Kate Sagal) and Marcy(Amanda Bearse) after they get stranded there after going broke from nutso gambling while Marcy tries to get over her divorce from Steve, which reminds me of my teenage days of living in the Imperial Valley since I was a Junior in high school in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time when this season was running on Fox.By the way I just got word that the Bundy's 11th Season is now in the works and is scheduled to be released this Fall on October 13th, 2009 and I can hardly wait either since the 1996-97 Season was the last and final season of the Bundy's on top of that.",N/A
1032161,"To me, this series is a solid 5 stars.  However, as many have noted, after releasing the entire first season in one pop, the studio decided to go for a money gouge and split up the second season into two parts, this first part virtually the same price as the entire first season.And you'll note that they have not come out with the second half of the second season.  I can only assume it is because of people refusing to pay as much for half a season as for a full season.Which means we're all screwed, basically.  We don't get the rest of the show, they don't get money.  This is what happens when greed backfires.  Hopefully the studio will give themselves a good shake and go back to releasing the rest of the series at a reasonable price.","Big Valley - Season 2, Volume 1"

1142222,"Let's take a look at this film in all its wonderful elements.  The premise - unique perspective on the horror genre.  With such a great idea, why was so much time (actually any time) wasted on the schlock pseudo-sex scenes?  What a waste.  That was time that could have been used to develop the plot.  This film felt like a twist on the old Stephen King Creep Show piece.  The main difference is that King knows how to deliver suspense without wasting time on unimportant minutia.  The characters - sort of pretty well developed.  Granted, not enough to actually care about any of them, but they were better developed than some horror films.  The antagonist (the evil weeds) - wow, I would have liked to see this entire theme better explained.  Maybe if the film-makers had cut the entire first 20+ minutes of this feature and spent that time on the actual ruins, well, then we might have had a 3 star film.  I give this waste-of-time 2 stars only for the big ""DAMN!"" scene...and you'll know which one that is when you see it.  Other than that, don't waste your time with this nonsense.  A truly disappointed horror fan.",The Ruins
1124636,"There are a couple of things one needs to know before reading on or for that matter watching this film.  Firstly, if you are aSawfan you might like this.  I am a not a fan of the Saw sequels.  I actually despise them so take that for what it is.  Secondly, if you haven't seen these films this is no place to start.  If you watch thefirst oneand then find your brain craving some bizarre inner need to watch even more unnecessary and gratuitous depictions of bloodshed, then soldier on through its sequels.  For the record, I don't put much stock into the quality of the original either.The Jigsaw Killer died in theprevious sequel, so here we just see the echoes of his self-righteous manipulations take their toll and wreak havoc on his victims even after his death.  The plot detail is long and a bit convoluted but really the ideas behind the traps and the many twists the film has are not bad, it is just that the cliche gets a bit tiring after a while.  If the film were done outside of the context of an obvious exploitation money-making machine I might even be praising how clever some of the film's details are.  The trouble is the film's goals are so obvious that quality in other respects (e.g. acting) is clearly placed aside in favor of making it's targeted audience squirm and cringe.  This is the modern dayA Nightmare on Elm StreetorFriday the 13thsequel but disguised underneath its surface of complexity and with far more in your face death/torture scenes.  To me, those aforementioned slasher film sequels had some comical charm within their obvious exploits, but the Saw franchise is pretending to be above that and that is unforgivable.  It is also somewhat sad that so many people would flock to see this.  It made $133 million worldwide ($63 million domestically) but cost just $10 million to make.  Either I don't get it at all, or I do get it and it's pretty twisted that so many people enjoy something so violent and so poorly done.I'm making myself out to be a movie snob for sure (and I probably am) but keep in mind I'm not opposed to violence in films.  In fact, I can even appreciate the use of violence to this extreme when it occurs in a serious and believable production or better yet in a film that doesn't have the intention of being taken seriously.  Saw IV's problem is that it takes itself seriously but doesn't in anyway feel remotely believable and even within the franchise's existence as a streamlined blockbuster producing monster, that is not acceptable to me.  Then again it's quite definitely acceptable for a lot of people.  That fact makes me squirm and cringe far more than the clever antics of the Jigsaw Killer.",N/A

Made a year after his rough Giallo ""L'Iguana Dalla Lingua di Fuoco"" the title suggests yet another Giallo. But, in fact, this film is not a Giallo at all - but a Gothic horror story about a cursed pearl necklace and a strange Satan's Cult which gets confronted by a hippie quartet on a day out. The story sounds unique.Made on a very low budget, Freda made more than the best out of it and created a strange movie with all the classic Gothic elements, and also boosts a handful of astonishing gore effects that echo the rude sequences of his Giallo a year before.The cast is lead by Camille Keaton of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" fame, while Luigi Pistilli delivers another neat performance as the leader of the strange Cult.

I used to look at it, hanging over his work bench, with the pointed spike on top, but never thought much about who had worn it originally.Now as I see this film, Joyeuse Noel, I am especially moved, for the actual true events of this amazing event and for what my father must have endured.  Like so many others, he never talked about his war experiences except the happy times when some French families entertained the American soldiers in their homes.The film shows in a moving but unsentimental way, the events that happened along the front one Christmas.  We see the build-up--the way the children of the three countries involved were taught to hate the others and we see the reality of the soldiers losing their buddies to the enemy.  And yet, through the magic of Christmas, for a brief moment, the hatred stopped and love prevailed.  If the event had not actually happened the film probably would have been dismissed as totatally unrealistic.  The fact that it did happen, can make us hope that some day the moments of dropping down our weapons will last longer than one day.The writer/director does the story justice.

It looks like the school of comedy has produced another in the long line of light entertainment. Decent story, decent comedy, and decent acting make it a decent rental.

If not the writers should be embarressed. I say this because I have seen most the comedy here in other movies. That is not to say I didn't find it amusing, because I did.

This signal seems to be playing with people's mind, turning them crazy and giving them a thirst for blood. They start imagining things and start seeing things around them differently.The movie is seperated in three parts, each directed by a different person. The first part is really the horror one. A young woman goes home after visiting her lover to find her husband, his friends and everyone in her building, completely insane. After spending a restless night trapped in the building, she runs away in order to try and find her lover again.In the second story, the husband ends up at the home of a couple who were about to have a New Year's eve party. This part is so funny and bloody that I couldn't stop laughing. The horror is extreme and very funny &agrave; la Shaun of the Dead. You have talking heads, revived corpses... the lot! The third part is the thriller section. The young woman and the lover are reunited but the husband is still out there ready to seperate them forever.True, the film might feel a bit disjointed because of these three different genres, but I truly liked this experiment. Your emotions keep shifting throughout the film, going from scares to laughter to thrills. The film never offers a dull moment. It's tight and to the point.The performances, from unknown actors, are quite good as well. And the style of the film is indie filmmaking at its best.

Michael Clayton [George Clooney in yet another of his trademark brooding roles] plays a 'janitor', a fixer of messes and awkward situations at a law firm run by Marty Bach [Sidney Pollack in a fine performance]. One of this messes involves getting his respected, but manic depressive colleague, Arthur Edens [a very credible Tom Wilkinson]back on track after the latter is charged for indecent exposure whilst at a deposition involving a chemical company.Arhtur's character is quite complex - he decides that his conscience will not allow him to represent the chemical company anymore, and turns out he has been working against the very people he is supposed to represent. Michael's firm is not the only one who wants Arthur under control. Tilda Swinton plays a highly ambitious Karen Crowder, lead counsel at UNorth , the chemical company being represented by Michael's law firm and is utterly ruthless when it comes to protecting her position at the comapny. Her character is played almost flawlessly by Swinton-her  nervous gestures,her obsessive compulsiveness, the conflict between doing what is ethical and what is right for her, all of these are portrayed in a very credible manner.The story really gets off the ground after a main character dies, and the action starts to pick up pace, leaving viewers wondering how everything is going to be set right, if ever.The plot is quite convoluted, but well-written so that viewers are able to follow the disjointed storyline. The cast of main characters are all complex and flawed people, even Michael himself, and the excellent quality of acting really elevates the movie to above average.All in all, this is a simmering potboiler of a movie that will intrigue and invite reflection.",N/A

Bloodlust (2000) is the new look 21st century Manga and is the main presentation for their next generation look.The cult reputation of the original story, which featured sexual elements as well as horrific violence, has been sacrificed and toned down to produce a picture for a larger audience. Vampire Hunter D is still action packed, and heads do get parted, but it is not as visceral as the 80s bag of guts.Essentially this is Manga's platform for its new style. Bloodlust looks almost as good as a completely CGI generated movie (such as the new Appleseed remake). While computers have been used to enhance the artwork, producing 3D special effects, it still essentially feels like Manga.The story revolves around the alledged kidnapping of a woman by a vampire. D is hired to bring her back and meets up with a team of vampire hunters along the way. There is a thrilling bridge sequence followed by the castle of illusions assault on all your senses ending.As long as you go into this knowing that its more mainstream than the cult classic then you will not be disappointed.

118176,"This film has always been one of my favorite WWII flicks and I finally got around to ordering a copy from Amazon, which I just received.  I'm definitely glad I did!The photography is excellent and the DVD video and sound quality, while not top shelf, were better than I expected.  The film is 1.33:1 ratio, but by playing it on ""full screen"" setting the picture completely filled my 16:9 ratio Panasonic's screen and the people and surroundings didn't seem unduly squat or compressed.The score for this film is also very good and creates the perfect balance of tension and bravado and blends perfectly with the action on screen.  And boy oh boy is there action.  Furious and frantic from start to finish, however the pace does slow often enough to flesh out the characters and allow you to care about them.  There were several times I paused the film to take stock of the remaining men, to confirm who had died and who fought on.  These men were well enough defined to easily have been my father or uncle, or somebody else I knew growing up.  They were brave and heroic, yet frightened and confused, typical All-American John Doe's each and everyone.The one element that might not be to the liking of every film buff is the jingoistic attitude and blatant racial slurs filling the movie.  The enemy combatants are constantly referred to as being ""Japs"" and ""Monkeys"" and to quote one of the American soldiers after he has witnessed an atrocity committed against one of his own, ""We ought to wipe em out. Wipe em off the face of the earth!""  Certainly not the attitude an enlightened individual should strive for, but understandable in light of world events unfolding when this movie was made.  And let's not forget that racial prejudice and intolerance was rampant on both sides of the ocean back then; fortunately much of the world has learned to curb such appetites in the years following the dark and desperate days of our Father's and Grandfather's youth.Objective Burma is one of the better films of its genre and perhaps Errol Flynn's finest performance.Highly Recommended.",N/A

1135527,"The eighth hilarious season of Fox's MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN introduces viewers to the all-male No Ma'am Club founded by Al Bundy(Ed O'Neill) and Jefferson D'Arcy(Happy Days alum Ted McGinley). The club members are either bachelors or husbands who are disgusted by their wives' demeanors/lifestyles. Afterall,Al doesn't often enjoy the company of his 22-year wife Peggy(Katey Sagal). In Jefferson's case,he's still madly in love with his wife,the former Marcy Rhoades(Amanda Bearse). I'm assuming that Jefferson co-founded the club primarily to give Al moral support. At every meeting,the members wear white T-shirts bearing the No Ma'am logo,which consists of the female symbol,encircled with a diagonal line over the symbol. But sometimes,Jefferson would enjoy the absence of his wife,but not as much as Al! Kelly(Christina Applegate),daughter of Al and Peggy,is still working as a roller-skating waitress which she began doing last season. Kelly's 19-year-old brother Bud(David Faustino),after a brief course in driving school instruction(degree required),takes a job at the DMV(Division of Motor Vehicles) as an instructor. I'll state for the record that Bud received his driver's license during season 5. I'm sure with Bud as an instructor,no one fails a driver's test! Jefferson still works as a waiter at a topless bar,which he began doing last season. As for the opening montage,there's still an instrumental theme similar to the late Frank Sinatra's 1955 hit recording LOVE & MARRIAGE. Reportedly,Sinatra's beneficiaries still refuse to let Sony Pictures continue using L&M. Many reviewers have commented on this,saying Sinatra's family is greedy which I don't believe is true. Possibly,the families of L&M's writers,Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen,are forbidding the continued use of the song. Well,the families refuse for their own reasons. The similarity is heard in the closing montage also. I guess we can say that the Bundys were still Kings of the Fox network during 1993-94. The animated SIMPSONS drew high ratings in its fifth season then also.",Married... with Children: Season 8

But the best thing is the amount of supense that this DVD builds up.I don't want to give away the story, but its about a few people that find themselves without any memories of who they are or how they got to an underground facility.  Here they are attacked by an unknown type of shadow creature.  The story is convincing as well as the acting.  Its a scary type of movie, but it has something refreshing and totally different about it than all those countless new horror film, that are mostly just based on blood and gore and usually have no valuable plott to them.Go and get this one, I don't think you will be disappointed.

1012131,"Michael Cuesta's 12 and Holding isn't a particularly showy film. It's shot very basically and obviously on a small budget. There's a small amount of fairly big-name talent among the adult cast but most of the kids are relatively unknown actors. Everyone though does an excellent job in bringing the viewer into this world and this situation. (aside from the occasionally over-acted line or 2.)Two twins, one with a major birthmark covering half his face who lives in his brother's shadow, defend their treehouse from bullies, who decide to burn it down, which accidentally kills the popular brother. The movie's about a group of 3 friends who spend most of the movie apart, and over the span of several months, each deal with their lives in their own ways. Jake, the surviving brother, has the only story that seems to be specifically about him grieving over his brother; he deals with his depressed parents, frequently goes to juvenile hall to visit his brother's killers, who he taunts with pictures of his dead brother, and dealing with his parents' decision to adopt a kid.The other 2 kids, though, (one a fat kid named Leonard and a girl named Malee) say they have moved on, and sure enough, their plots deal very little with the death. Leonard, who lost his ability to taste food since the incident, decides to desperately begin losing weight. He attempts to force his very overweight family to join him. Malee, meanwhile, reveals herself to be a very lonely girl who clings to an adult construction worker she has a thing for. He's probably the best character in the movie, and is acted extremely well. This plot turns out to resonate the most. Although neither of these two friends seem to be openly grieving over the death, these plots and their actions reveal somewhat disturbed and sad characters, who have been clearly messed up by the death, even though they (and the movie) never specifies this.The movie, although the actual death is early in the film and many of the funeral proceedings happen offscreen, makes EXCELLENT use of songs that are both ambient and eerie. These are sprinkled throughout the film and always served to somehow remind me of the tragedy early on in the film and they keep an otherworldly air flowing throughout.The movie's not perfect. I found many of the adults to be pretty irritating (except for the construction worker, who'se the only adult in the movie who doesn't seem to be a cliche) and I also thought the fat kid's story seemed to be extremely reminiscent of a bad sitcom. It just didn't really seem to fit with the rest of the movie. Aside from the excellent licensed music, the actual soundtrack that was COMPOSED for the film's extremely week. The same song plays frequently, and other music just seems to further bring to light the feel of a bad sitcom.But this is all completely forgotten by the time the film reaches its very powerful ending...which has definitely divided the opinions of several people who have seen it. Some may call it ""out of nowhere,"" but it all made complete sense to me. This kid was NOT alright, and getting closure was important to him and that was what he felt he had to do....and it all just sort of clicked at the end. It was these final scenes that left the biggest impression on me.It's not flawless but it's a very powerful film that's definitely worth a viewing for anyone whose into indie films or into ""human"" stories.",12 and Holding
348974,"About the best you can say for Bette Midler's performance is that she does her own singing. And even some of that is sloppy and careless. Her acting is one-note, and she kills her best comedy lines by alternately gasping or screeching them. (Say what you will about Roz Russell, she at least knew how to deliver lines.) We know that Madame Rose's kiddie troupe is getting a bit long in the tooth, but Jennifer Beck as ""Dainty"" June looks fully thirty years old. Cynthia Gibb is a lovely Louise/Gypsy, but Natalie Wood ""aged"" more credibly in the admittedly flawed by classier 1962 theatrical film adaptation. Peter Riegert is too mousy as Herbie, so much of the point of a strong man continually knuckling under to Rose's steamroller whim is lost. (When he does stand up to Rose, he seems more petulant than assertive.) Stars are wasted in bit parts, and Andrea Martin unwisely and unsuccessfully tries to be funny as Mrs. Cratchitt (who was played hilariously ""straight"" in the 1962 film by Jean Willes.)The production itself looks cheesy and low budget, and the bright crayon colors don't help. Even the lamb was cuter in the earlier movie!Still, it's an earnest attempt. And with great material like that, it's hard to go far wrong. As many others have pointed out, the adaptation is faithful to the original. But oh, why didn't somebody think to do a second film of GYPSY in the 70s while Merman was still around to do it?",Gypsy VHS
1160959,"Downfall is supposed to be the prequel to the Dead Space video game that was released prior to the video. There was a series of preview comics that were downloadable off the XBox marketplace that, and I assumed that the movie was going to be a base for the movie. However, this was not the case.Ther movie primarily follows the Chief of Security of the Ishimura, who tries to contain the outbreak of violence and the necromorphs on the mining ship. The sequence follows a predictable path of disbelief, followed by a dug-in resistance. Several scenes are badly handled. Namely, a officer sees his own wife decapitate herself, and reacts as if she dropped a carton of eggs on the carpet. The ending is very dark and in line with the games tone. That was probably the only scene that reminded me of the Dead Space game.Downfall was written and produced by someone who was told the plot of the video game, and maybe saw it played, but had no opportunity to play it themselves, and also had only cliff notes on the backstory. None of the scenes from the movie that appeared in game are remotely similar, and were well done in the video game, so it was disappointing to see them mess with it. None of the weapons of equipment from the game even makes an appearance, though one that does show up prominently, I wish had been in the game.If the movie had had another title, it would've crawled up to 3 stars, as I wasn't a fan of the srtwork, but the name Dead Space raised expectations, which weren't met on almost every front.",Dead Space: Downfall
566088,"As if ""Anaconda"" wasn't a bad enough giant snake movie, this faux-Anaconda proves that whenever you think it can't get any worse, you are probably mistaken. The film starts with a giant snake punching a hole in the side of a secret government plane and causing it to crash. The film then breaks our necks in a jump cut to the most annoying credits ever filmed featuring an amateur demonstrating skillful stunts on a bicycle. Sound exciting?The hero of the film is the cyclist who has a falling out with his brother over EPA standards for the chemical processing plant full of huge vats of acid they have inherited. There are subplots about camping holidays, annoying realtors, a crazed herpetologist (Robert Englund, who intermittently produces a small snake from his pocket and cuddles with it), and the State Department (of course). To add to the malaise there are moronic government agents (led by Casper Van Dien, who sports the worst accent in recent history), and an overly enthusiastic cop who makes Barney Fife look genuinely menacing.Along the way important lessons are learned: first, understand that squirting baby shampoo at a 130 foot long snake which shoots acid out of its mouth will not repel the snake, however, it may eat your shower curtain; and second, remember that when fleeing for your life on a bicycle from a huge snake capable of crawling at 50 miles per hour, it is important to stop to put on your bike helmet and sunglasses before starting to run from the rapidly encroaching menace. These are just two of the helpful pointers you will learn from ""Python"". The ending of the film is extremely predictable from the point where we learn that the protagonist co-owns an acid factory. I'll give you a clue, it involves the game of hide and seek, and the snake is ""it"".The film is about as lame as lame can get: I can't imagine what the sequel must be like. I can't say that I recommend this film exactly, but I will say that if you want a good laugh at the expense of a hapless CGI snake, this might be a good choice.",N/A
170665,"My girlfriend and sister used to get together to watch this show every Friday, but they noticed some problems.  Why must every episode, for instance, break down into emotional hysteria in the final act?  Is it too much to do some location shooting so the show doesn't look so tied to a back lot set?  And how much of Jennifer Love Hewitt's cleavage must they display in every episode?The show plainly aims for a primarily female audience.  Girl-bonding and loving-hubby themes are mainstays of the structure.  But it also tries to drum up suspense and horror.  I won't say the two can't go together, but the pattern is distinctly repetitive.  Nearly every episode begins with Hewitt's character, Melinda Gordon, trembling in fear of some gruesome spirit; nearly every episode ends with Gordon in tears of mourning as she explains to the spirit why crossing over isn't so bad.Perhaps the mainly male production team thinks that teary-eyed protestations of limp theology will reach a girly audience.  And perhaps they're right, since the show has a large loyal following.  But women I trust, like my sister and my girlfriend, assure me that when the show piles on the same structure week after week, it taxes their ability to take the emotions seriously.Though the show aims for a mainly female audience, it never misses a chance to render good-looking women like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Aisha Tyler as eye candy.  I suspect the creative team thinks men will watch more if there's a hint of skin.  And I can't deny that my girlfriend is sick of me hitting the rewind button every time Sigourney Weaver strips to her skivvies in ""Alien.""  But men need that eye candy in a story we can get behind, not one that peters out in favor of a weepy sermon just when things are getting good.This show's spirit world is especially weak tea.  We hear a lot about the light and, in a handful of episodes, about the dark, but they are never defined.  Whenever Melinda Gordon is pressed on this question, she finks.  My suspicion is that the creative team wants to avoid offending any particular religion.  They accomplish this task by addressing none of them.  Considering that this question comes up in nearly every episode, I find a ""ho-hum"" coming on every time we approach the final act.This series is very loosely based on the work of spiritists James Van Praagh and Mary Ann Wintkowski, both of whom are interviewed in the special features of this DVD collection.  Don't watch them.  It's amazing how they can discuss something as potentially mind-blowing as talking with the spirits of the dead, and still come across as uninteresting wet rags.I know many people enjoy this show, and I don't want to take anything from them.  If this is your taste, bless your heart.  But when I deal with such potentially meaty subjects, I don't want my story to wimp in the clutch.  I look forward to a show which addresses questions like these without giving up its teeth.  This show just doesn't meet my needs.",N/A
71534,"One of the oldest filmic clich&eacute;s is that there's nothing sadder than an old boxer, a washed up pug. To that I might state that only an old wrestler is sadder. After all, wrestling is not a true sport- it's a violent theatrical production, and there is not much at stake for the viewers. As for the wrestlers, themselves....that's where this documentary from 2000 comes in. Directed by first time auteur Barry Blaustein it chronicles the re-rise of pro wrestling to prominence in the late 1990s- the era that saw Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Cactus Jack become celebrities of a greater nature than any of their forebears, like Killer Kowalski, Dusty Rhodes, Bruno Sammartino, or Hulk Hogan.The film starts off as an exploration of the men behind the `names', yet it makes a mistake right off the bat, by billing itself as an expos&eacute; of the sport, a film that `Vince McMahon doesn't want you to see'. McMahon, to those in the know, is the owner of the largest wrestling league in the nation- the WWE, then the WWF, but there's little in the film to suggest that this is a tell-all. There are some wrestlers with gripes, and we see tales of failed lives, and failed wrestling circuits, like the ECW and WCW (long since bought out by the WWE), and McMahon's league certainly has a history of dealing in drugs (steroids, etc.- as the aforementioned Hogan testified against him in a highly publicized trial in the early 90s), as well as being shamefully anti-union, and not caring of its performers (not long after the film's release one of its wrestlers- Owen Hart, of a well-known wrestling clan- was killed in a spectacular fashion while performing, and the film acknowledges that one of its minor characters, Droz, was paralyzed not long after the film was completed), but all of this is public knowledge, and old news.What works, though is the portrait of the biz the film portrays, and the three main wrestlers whose lives it follows.... The film has its moments of poignancy and insight, but they are too few and far between. A more pristine and jaded eye would have been necessary, and a more ballsy approach to the subject matter, to gain a following outside the `choir' of pro wrestling. Still, since I go to those pews, every few years, I think it's a must see for any wrestling fan. The game has changed much during the decades, yet, in a sense, it hasn't changed at all. Whether good or bad is the crux, and what this film passes on.",N/A
672774,"I had a previous review here in which I blasted Ernster and Dermota for their weak voices and Della Casa for her tepid performance, as well as expressing my dislike of the final sextet which for me ruins the drama of the opera.So what changed? Well I watched it again on a small screen rather than trying to get mono sound out of a 6 speaker home theater system. This doesn't change the fact that Della Casa is a ""run of the mill Elvira"" as I said. Nor does it make me like the silly sextet, but it does equalize the voices somewhat. This gives new life and drama to the important parts of Don Ottavio and the Commendatore played by Anton Dermota and Deszo Ernster. The dress rehearsal type atmosphere(no audience) and 50's costumes and sets cease to be noticable after awhile.Not much need be said about Cesare Siepi who I believe more and more is the greatest Don ever. Same for  Elisabeth Grummer, who again in my opinion was the best Donna Anna ever. Edelmann is a treat as Leporello despite a bad hair stylist.Erna Berger as Zerlina is easy on the ears if not the eyes and Walter Berry is still my favorite Masetto.Furtwangler has to do little more than be there with a cast like this. Where his genius shows is that he keeps the music moving and doesn't try to make the opera his own when it belongs to Mozart, a mistake too many conductors make.Taken with all the singers on equal terms this may just be the best Don Giovanni on DVD.",N/A

1173755,"I knew I was in trouble when, within 15 minutes of this film starting, I had to deal with another 'John Favreau-Swingers' type of character.  That means that we get to spend an hour and forty five minutes watching a whiny 30 year old guy mope around because his girlfriend dumped him.This would be tolerable for a high school kid, but not a 30 year old guy who they show throughout the film as being almost a 3rd wheel at his gf's premiers and red carpet events.  he doesn't like any of the clothes she buys him, either...so you never really know why he is so devastated with the breakup to begin with.  The more they flashed back to their past the more you realize what a nightmare she is....so I don't get it.But anyway, this guy decides the best way to clear his head is to go to Hawaii.  Of course, his ex is at the same hotel on the same island with her new man.  Basically, it's the same plot as any other 'comedy' about breakups and how people try to get over failed relationships.  I guess this is the structure for Comedy 101, but the filmmakers and writers here are better than that, so the entire premise is disappointing.It's way too easy to figure out what's going to happen when he checks into the hotel, has the awkward moment with his ex and...SHOCK...there's a beautiful brunette who just happens to work at the reception desk.Since everyone is comparing this to 'Knocked Up'...there is no comparison.  Everything about 'Knocked Up' was completely original and had the type of dialogue that you just didn't/don't get in American cinema.  The only thing close to it was 'There's Something About Mary'.I understand it's hard to live up to that kind of standard and virtually everything they do from here on out will be a bit of a disappointment.  However, this really was a major disappointment.  I 'chuckled' three times at three lines that may have taken up a combined :17 of film time...and when you're dealing with an hour and forty five minutes of film time, that's a lot of dead air.I think we'd be better in comparing it to another movie....Ben Stiller's 'The Heartbreak Kid' that was equally as bad.

1130174,"This movie is a sloppy and rather pointless remake that curiously doesn't have much to do with Romero's original, which though flawed, is more entertaining than this. There are a lot of small details that will annoy the zombie/horror fan here. On their own, they don't matter much, but add them together and you have a very disappointing film.The acting? I didn't think it was too bad, actually. Mena Suvari and Ving Rhames, although uninspired,  add weight and authority to the story, but unfortunately, they decide to knock off Rhames early in the film and it goes downhill from there.The zombies? Crucial to a movie like this, of course. The virus storyline is never explored, just mentioned in passing. The zombies actually manage to be even more energetic and athletic than in the previous (and excellent) Dawn of the Dead remake, which is a feat in itself. They run, jump, climb on the ceiling (seriously), snarl, growl, and flail around like spastics with seizures pretty much non-stop. The transformation from infected normal human being to half-rotten zombie with the skin falling off literally takes place in the blink of an eye.The FX? Generally decent with some really bad CGI thrown in there.The story? There isn't much of one. Like I said, the virus aspect is briefly mentioned and then ignored. After that, it's business as usual. Running around, lots of screaming, people being killed, OMG What are we going to do, argh, splat, urgh.The bottom line? Cheap, sloppy, and rushed. A wasted opportunity.",N/A

The story is mostly a fictionalized plot, except for the actual battle scenes where York captured all those Germans. The real York insisted that those be done just the way it happened with no embellishment (except for the ""turkey call"").Gary Cooper gave one of his classic low-key, everyman performances as York. Great cast of supporting players, from the great Walter Brennan down to new-comer Joan Leslie. (Watch ""This is the Army,"" which was made a couple years later and see some of the same contract actors from Warner Bros.

(My family and I even went camping in middle Tennessee and visited York's grave site and the beautiful little mountain valley he came from.

654392,"I've had to let this film sink in a bit after seeing it in the theatre.  Indiana Jones is certainly one of my all-time favorites, and I had been looking forward to ths 4th installment since the news was released years ago it was in works and even cancelled for some time (boy was I dissapointed).  I was too thrilled when I learned about its come back and I knew with Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford on the project it had to be a winner.  Funny thing is, it never felt quite like what I expected out of these guys.Ok, so Ford is older and just wasn't the same.  But he really was not bad either, in fact he held up pretty well in some of the action scenes (and he did do a few stunts himself).  Karen Allen is definelty a returning treat as well, who was always my favorite of the three original Jones ladies.  Shia Lebouf, surprisingly, made a stronger impact than I thought possible (though Im not sure I can see him taking over the role of Indiana Jones as has been rumored for a sequal).  Cate Blanchet, despite being an excellent actress, never stole the show as a memorable villain.  She definelty has a few strong scenes (mainly her sword fighting in the jeep chase scene) but her part never came close in comparison to previous Jones villains.The story suffered a bit I thought.  Though I appreciate that once again the Crystal skulls artificats are real world artifcats that contain mysterious powers, the plot got a little carried away on this one I thought.  Now I won't give away the ending (though I'm sure one way or another the secret is already out) but it just didn't fit into the Indiana Jones realm in my humble opinion.  However, the adventure, action, laughs and thrills are all there along the way, with some scenes (the beginning warehouse scene and the jeep chase) brining some Raiders nostalgia back.  Things do slow down quite a bit and get a bit boring about mid-way through, but overall its a fun ride.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull surpasses Temple of Doom, but that's about it.  This one is nowhere as good as Raiders or Last Crusade, but that was kind of to be expected.  Considering its almost 20 years since the last film, there is more good to this one than bad.  Fans will enjoy it and should see this, but it will leave you with a bit of a bitter taste in the end.Acting - 4Action - 4.5Characters - 4Story - 3Overall - 4",N/A
5051,"How well I remember walking out of the theatre in 1976, and looking up at the sky as if it were a living thing! CE3K remains a beautiful metaphor for all that is unknown. For many of us, the first question will be, ""Did Steven ditch that interior of the Mothership?"" Happily, it was the first cut he made. All the good stuff is here, edited more tightly by an admittedly older and less credulous director. Yet despite his avowed ""maturity"" (read skepticism), his Director's Cut is delicious, loving, and as full of wonder as ever. I know this is unpopular: I love Spielberg for his lyricism, his poetry, and his willingness to take us ""out there."" ""Private Ryan"" was quite well-made. I've never gotten through Schindler. But in CE3K, ET, Jurassic Park, Always and others, Steven has shown me things I've always wanted to see. Though much of his industry recognition has come from his more recent work, it's always been his forays into fantasy that seemed so redolent of truth to me. In the Director's Cut, he shows that the boy within the man is still alive and luminous. Dreyfuss has never had a better turn (arguable, admittedly, when one thinks of ""Mr. Holland's Opus,"" a more mature tour-de-force for him) and Melinda Dillon is the ultimate feminine archetype. Can't recommend this highly enough. The decision to split the newer ""extras"" into three parts, across the DVDs is inconvenient, and a small matter in the face of this wonderful release.And if you like that dreadful UFO interior, it's on the second DVD.

This flick still had all the action that you can squeeze into an action movie and then some but, while taken to excess, it wasn't as engaging or interesting as the two previous movies and the acting was so bad it actually hurts to watch (except for Paul Giammani, who I enjoyed).Now I understand that Shoot 'em Up is supposed to be a bizarre, over-the-top  movie where action reigns supreme and things like plot, scripting and acting are second seat but the action itself wasn't enough for this movie to stand on.

1025316,"Michael Mann's previous films ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"" are two masterpieces of the crime genre. Knowing his considerable skill at telling a stylish and gritty story in this genre there were a lot of high hopes for ""Miami Vice"". When I initially saw the film in theaters I was pretty disappointed.  Mann's dialogue was kinda embarrassing and amateurish and the other parts of it were what he calls ""shop talk"" between the cops and the crooks. If you aren't as well versed in it as he is you often don't follow because you don't know what's being said. That is one of Manns' gifts as a director is that he knows this world of crime better than anyone which enables him to make these films as realistic as possible. Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are in a club trying to entrap a pimp when Crockett gets an urgent phone call. It's  from an informant they haven't worked in six months. He sounds terrified and fears for his life and that of his girlfriend. When the boys meet up with him he informs them that a White Supremacist group he was arranging a drug deal with learned who he was working with and he was forced to give  up Crockett and Tubbs. Distraught the man throws himself in front of an oncoming semi. That night after investigating the scene of the crime Crockett and Tubbs get recruited by the Miami P.D.. The local cops want the boys to go undercover for the drug cartel and see the deal through. They also want them to root out the mole who has compromised their identities. This dangerous mission sends the men to exotic locales like the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Paraguay, and eventually Cuba. Their connection is a small time dealer named Yero (John Ortiz in one of the film's best performances ). Crockett and Tubbs pose as smugglers in possession of a super fast boat that is undetectable by radar since it travels low and fast. Yero doesn't trust them but Isabella, his banker,  does. She is played by the beautiful Gong Li and with two lookers like her and Colin Farrell a romance is inevitable. Crockett and Tubbs figure out how low on the chain Yero is and realize that they are going to have do numerous drops until they find the higher up responsible for the murder of their informant. Since Crockett is escorting Isabella to Cuba for the perfect mojito Tubbs is left to arrange the meetings with the dealers. This causes friction between the two partners since everyone but Crockett realizes the danger he is in by sleeping with Yero's woman. With Mann directing and the above mentioned locales the film looks great and he has assembled a capable cast who all give good performances. Foxx does a lot more of the work than Farrell making him a little more like able. Ortiz is a very colorful villain in the ""Scarface"" tradition. Gong Li does a good job of capturing the fear and independence of a woman involved in this line of work. As with most Mann films  the background players are deserving of a lot more screen time. In this case you have the excellent Justin Theroux who is part of Crockett and Tubb's team and the gorgeous and talented Naomie Harris who is Ricardo's girlfriend Trudy. The two have a fair amount of scenes but I wish they could have been written a little better rather than just appearing in the background as support for Crockett and Tubbs. The action scenes are few and far between but when they happen they are easily the best thing going for the film. The last half hour in particular is exactly what made Heat and Collateral masterpieces. You wish that that kind of energy and excitement happened more often rather than coming all at once in the film's final act.",N/A
1013888,"I watched the HBO documentary ""Thin"" because I thought it might lend some helpful insight for me to better understand eating disorders. Instead, I came away frustrated and still asking questions.Directed by Lauren Greenfield, ""Thin"" is a documentary covering the lives of four sufferers of some type of eating disorders:  Shelly, a psychiatric nurse who is 25; (b) Alisa is a divorced (?) mother of two and 30; (c) Polly, who is just a mess, and is 29; and (d) Brittany, who is 15.  It is filmed at Renfrew Center in Florida, a center for eating disorders.All of these women look horrible.  Most have suffered some type of major organ damage because of their eating disorders, yet they still choose to pursue their own death.  Polly, for instance, tried suicide because she (gasp) let herself eat two pieces of pizza.  Shelly was on so many pills she probably should have also gone into detox.  The one that affected me the most was 15-year old Brittany, who literally wanted to die rather than get fat.  The fact that her own mother was her enabler (she, too, suffers from an eating disorder) made me all the madder.  Watch for the part where Brittany tells about her and her mother's ""chew and spit"" cycle of eating, and then cringe when you hear her sob at the end when she tells another patient that she ""misses being up at 2:00 a.m. changing her clothes all the time, and at least if she dies, she'll die thin.""I think that all these women have suffered some type of major trauma in their lives, but that was never touched on.  Shelly and Alisa seem to have some kind of monsters they are running from, but you'll never know what those monsters are.  I do not know if eating disorders are considered a mental illness.  If not, they should be.  However, these eating disorders remind me of ANY addiction:  if these women refuse to admit they have a problem, no one can help them.  There is no wonderful ending to this documentary.  The outcomes are mostly stark and offer no resolution.",Thin

His antagonist, Sgt Doakes, gets off, then back on Dexter's case. It will begin a showdown of significance. We learn more about some of the characters, including Dexter's foster dad, and his sister Deb gets to have (another) romance.

The consequences of this relationship ripple into the lives of Dexter's loved ones, including Rita and her kids.Keith Carradine comes into the cast as an FBI expert on serial killers, one with a bit of a zen vibe.

968234,"[...]How do we learn how to forgive? How can I forgive if the person is no longer here? No longer speaking, nowhere near, no grave to visit, no unknown granddaughter to bring us together, no bear which forces us to face our fears. How do we learn to Love?Love this film, love the soundtrack, the music, the vistas, the views; I have watched it three times in a row right now. If only life could be likethis. How can we do it? Questions remain.I personally did not like Robert Redford's character. His rage is outstanding, inappropriate and wrong. He is not much different than the young man that took his anger out on Jennifer. He just uses words with women and fists with men. In a normal place, he would be in jail for his behavior. The worst of it is that he isn't even drinking anymore, and his rage and violence remains. It's so ""American"" to make the hero an angry warmonger. Out of the entire cast and film, this was my only complaint. When Captain Call in Lonesome Dove (Tommy Lee Jones) behaved this way, at least he knew he had overreacted, and felt some sense of shame. Redford shows none. What did he learn about ""accidents"" and forgiveness and rage? That ""the bad guy"" still ""deserves it?""I could see Mickey Rourke acting in this part with the ice-cold smoldering anger he carries to his films, but Redford? Never. Didn't like it at all. The day would come all too soon when the daughter-in-law or granddaughter would do ""something"" to instigate his ire, and then LOOK OUT.Everything else was fantastic, Freeman (of course), the young grand daughter, and Jennifer Lopez was excellent.

280658,"Technically, this is one of the worst movies ever made.  The acting is stilted, the music is predictable, and the set designs are pedantic.  Gary Cooper hated his interpretation of the courtroom scene. Ayn fought tooth and nail with the studio heads to have it filmed exactly as she wrote it.  Unfortunately she won.  The heavy hand of novelist Ayn Rand's script is evident throughout.  Fortunately, the theme of the story, a man's uncompromising individuality, more than makes up for the film's shortcomings.  Throughout her life, Ayn, (pronounced eye-ann), Rand, influenced by her childhood experiences in communist Russia, campaigned for the rights of the individual over the collective.  Her novel ""The Fountainhead"" was her crowning achievement in this direction.  Although her ideas did not translate into film as well as they might have, her message comes through loud and clear.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a mind; but I would read the book first.

582025,"Massacre at Central High (Rene Daalder, 1976)I first saw Massacre at Central High over a quarter-century ago, probably on HBO, and have been searching for it again ever since. I finally managed to track down a copy thanks to a recent overseas DVD release (it's about time we got a domestic one, no?); while this is by no means deathless cinema-- Daalder started his career as a cameraman for Russ Meyer-- it is, if anything, even better than I remembered it being.David (Derrell Maury) is the new kid at an exclusive high school. One of his old friends, Mark (Andrew Stevens), already goes there. He's fallen in with the school bullies, and plans to use his affiliation with them to protect David. David, unfortunately, has other plans, both in standing up to them himself and organizing the rest of the students against them. The bullies, of course, have other plans, and soon the conflict has escalated.It's impossible to get to what really makes this movie so gripping without going into major spoilers; we'll just say that things reach a rather absurd conclusion (hinted at in the title)-- and then go two or three steps further in the movie's final act. This is a movie where the scenario does all the work; the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the soundtrack, all are average at best (and plumb some truly strange depths at worst; Rainbeaux Smith, topless, idly playing with a box of dynamite, may be a nadir in seventies exploitation cinema, where outright silliness is concerned. Not that you're likely to notice, given that, well, Rainbeaux Smith is topless). But the concept is so outlandish that it somehow works.

I love country music (my favorite kind) and i was just starting to get in to country music at the time, and was one of my favorite parts about it. Doug stone is sensational in his role as well as Kristy Young and the young man that plays Hanky. Both very smart and talented young actors. If you like this kind of movie, you will appreciate the Christian values (the hymn ""By and By [When the Morning Comes]"" can actually be heard by a congregation singing in a country church as Gordy makes his trekk off the farm) (the hymn is older, but it was acutlaly my first introduction to hymn from this movie), and also appreciate the cuteness of the pig and kids, the beautiful countryside (not sure if it was filmed in Arkansas), the fun of bad guys Brinks, Deets, Snipes, and Crudmen, and all the country music, even a musical number of ""Ya'll Come"" from Branson featuring Roy Clark, Moe Bandy, Mickey Gilley, Boxcar Willie, Jim Stafford, Buck Trent, and Cristy Lane. Doug Stone's real life hits and songs including ""More Love"", ""Dream High"" and ""Wishbone"" are presented superbly, as well as the Eddie Rabbitt/Crystal Gayle duet ""I Made A Promise"" and movie tune, ""Your Heart's On the Line"" by Kristy Young.In response to a previous reviewer's comments, i hardley think that extremely-mild body part launguage in Kristy's song such as ""butt"" ""buns"" and ""fly"" are innappropriate for any 3 year old, much less a young woman of 12 to be singing about. (no crude sexuality impilied in the song). This movie is as  wholesome and as Christian-valued as it gets for kids. Just another reason i love it. This movie is outstanding for any country music lover, and is worth it to spring for even just for the music itself. In comparison, Babe is a more gentle-paced, drama like movie, while Gordy is more high-energy, line dance kinda groove with comedy, a little drama, and even a little love story.

Get it at Amazon.)Ken Sherry (George Shevtsov), a tall, divorced, sleazy, and a bit in love with himself disc jockey from Brisbane comes to the tiny berg of Sunray to take over disc jockeying duties at the local radio station.  He likes to spin platters with deep vocals from seductive male voices like Barry White's while spewing out tidbits of philosophy and poetry designed to enthrall the ladies.  In the house next door to the one he has acquired, live two unmarried sisters, Dimity (Miranda Otto) and Vicki-Ann (Rebecca Frith) who toss out the lures in the hope of landing such a catch.(The fishing metaphor here and those to follow are appropriate because at one point Dimity notices that Ken has a kind of scar on his neck making her think he has gills.  Additionally he has a marlin on one of his walls, although he won't eat fish.  Furthermore, in the opening scene of the movie, Dimity and Vicki-Ann are actually fishing.)Anyway, for the girls the lesson here is be careful what you fish for since the catch of your dreams might turn out to be the tomcod of your nightmares.  Dimity is younger, virginal and a bit odd.  She's a waitress at the local Chinese restaurant.  Older sister Rebecca is slightly desperate and on the make.  She runs the town's beauty parlor.  As the competition for Ken heats up they decide they hate each other.  At first the younger sister Dimity seem to have him hooked, but then Rebecca seems to be hauling him in and headed for matrimonial bliss, so much so that she opens her trousseau and takes out her wedding gown to try it on and show him..., and then....Well, the key here is that the script and direction by Shirley Barrett is just so diabolically clever and so full of keen insights into the psychology of men and women, especially women, that it is just a riot.  Otto manages the sweet innocence and naivet&eacute; of a 14-year-old, although she is supposed to be twenty.  The expressions she gets on her face are just so, so funny.  I loved the scene where she is on Ken's couch and he is sitting arrogantly on the other end and at length asks her if she wants to be kissed.  Yes, she does; and the way she slides over to him, bit by anxious bit, was just too funny.  I also loved the scene where Ken is on top of her and she is lying on her back looking up at ceiling (at the camera of course) with an somewhat puzzled, pleased and expectant expression on her face, as if she is searching for what she is supposed to be feeling while Ken mechanically continues to do what he is doing.Also good is the scene near the end, high in the silo, where Ken is explaining something to Rebecca.  The camera is on him, but directly behind him we see Dimity's face smiling in some delight as if she knows how this is going to end.  (And she does.)I thought it was interesting that the small town of Sunray, Australia could have easily been Sunray Kansas or Sunray, Ohio, so much was it like a typical small American town.  I also found apt how the soundtrack of seductive hits from the seventies, ""Love Serenade"" itself, and two others by Barry White, but also ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" by Billy Paul, mirrored Ken Sherry's ""philosophy"" of love and meshed well with his deep, sonorous voice.  The song ""My Coo Ca Choo"" by Alvin Stardust played near the end was apparently a hit in Australia, but this was the first time I'd heard it.  Good song.See this for Shirley Barrett who simultaneously satirizes both male and female sexuality in a manner that would have delighted Oscar Wilde and any number of comedy writers, and for Miranda Otto who was both funny and charming.",Love Serenade VHS

That man was in for a Rude Awakening. The tables were turned, she was completely out of her rotten mind and she tried to find evidence against him. All she found, was one picture, one measley picture of an underage girl. This sets her character off, causing her to do the unthinkable to a man, who says he's innocent. This so-called film caused me to feel sorry for the guy. He's being tortured, accused, electricuted, humiliated, operated on and worst of all, horrified. He was the victem in all of this.

Except for a few, very minor twists, anyone who's seen The Ring, The Grudge, One Missed Call, etc.. can see what's coming a mile away. Not to stay that the overall story or plot is actually bad, but as far as originality goes, this film doesn't even really come close. The acting, which isn't amazing, isn't horrible either. However, I gotta say that Joshua Jackson performances can just be plain boring or lethargic at times. In closing, this film might be a hit with someone who's new to this kind of genre, and who knows, if this movie had been made before a few of these other Asian horror flicks were made, I might be a bit impressed, cause again, this isn't bad of a film. But the fact is that this film is just more of the same stuff that I've seen before, with not enough originality to make it any more memorable than the rest of these other flicks out there, gives me no other choice but pretty much disregard it.",N/A

734185,"While Dr. Wells' delivery in the documentary can be occasionally a bit hyperbolic to compensate for a wide audience, the material is fascinating.  The people he encounters along his journey are intelligent and articulate individuals, presented respectfully with varying opinions in regards to their own beliefs.  Dr. Wells' gradually becomes more comfortable with what he calls his ""blood speech,"" the explanation of his genetic research and his purpose for seeking those individuals specifically, and he is patient to give equal emphasis to their stories as well supporting his own.What I truly respected about this video is that it doesn't beat the Creation vs. Evolution argument into the ground.  That isn't the point of the documentary.  What it does do is re-emphasize that no one ethnic group is superior over another, and that, regardless of skin color or ethnic background, we are all brothers and sisters.  With documentaries such as this one, and proper education, we can eradicate the false idea of ""race,"" and just start seeing family.For an interesting website on more of this information, check out The Bradshaw Foundation at [...]",Journey of Man VHS
1126768,"*Just a heads up, Spoilers ahead*I just got finished watching ""The Mist"" and am not sure what to think. I guess I'll figure it out by the end of the review. The story is centered around a small town community that undergoes a big storm leaving the townspeople in a panic. As they all head to a small local grocery store a strange mist comes upon the entire area. Those in the store are warned by an olderman that there is something in the mist that killed one of his friends. He urges for everyone to stay inside but there are always a few hard headed folks that just won't listen. As they go into the mist they quickly disappear leaving only a terrified scream behind.As the story moves forward we begin to see some interesting creatures. I was impressed by the visuals with the creatures being very different then what you usually see in these type films. At this point we have a few battles that all take place inside the grocery store once some of the creatures get inside. Besides fighting off creatures they also have to deal with an overly preachy townswoman that I was begging to see killed off. She will drive you to the brink of insaity, trust me. The film then begins to turn more toward showing how humanity deals with life threatening situations by turning on each other. I could have done without this idea. I really just want to watch a fun film without having to see someones opinions rolled into it. I feel it also made the film drag on. There was a bit too much focus on this topic.I'm not going to give the ending away but will say that it is very morbid. It definately wasn't the ending I was expecting. However I will give it credit since it was different from a mainstream hollywood ending. So overall I thought it was decent just way too long. It could have been wrapped up much quicker. I recommend checking it out but only as a rental.",N/A
1096859,"Three stars is a generous rating for this collection of short films, given that most of them were mediocre at best, but since everything is relative, the truly AWFUL ones made the so-so ones seem good. By the time I got to the vampire segment (the biggest stinker of the bunch), I had the distinct feeling that most of the participants in this project don't respect their audience very much. Rather, they think we're an indiscriminate bunch of philistines and ADD sufferers. I began to feel as though I was seated next to an antsy channel-surfer who had bogarted the remote, and viewing the DVD extras just enhanced this feeling.My favorite segment was of the Postal worker from CO visiting Paris and narrating her experience in miserably accented French. This had a hokey (but in a good way) charm to it, in the manner of a sketch from ""A Prairie Home Companion"". It made me laugh aloud, but since it's near the end I had to slog through a lot of less-than-stellar material to get there.I had hoped to be able to recommend this movie to friends and acquaintances with a fondness for the city of Paris; but alas, I can only tell them to proceed with caution.",N/A

1105256,"The Film:  The Velvet VampireYear Made:  1971Overview:  Diane, a beautiful woman with a thirst for something red lives in a place that no other vampire has ever been known to live.  She invites a couple to come visit her at her tranquil desert estate.  Slowly she seduces them into her web of death.  Why does she stay in the desert of all places?  Is she really a vampire or is it all a illusion?  Who will escape the bite of the Velvet Vampire!The Package:  4 Stars.  The graphics on this DVD holder is really cool and it just has this spooky, bloody, vampire phycodelic feel to it.  It really is cool just to look at.  Inside the case there is no inlay which was a let down, the disc itself holds very nicely into the holder and is easy to pop out at the same time.  On the disc itself is a picture graphic of the eyes/face of Diane (The Velvet Vampire) which is really cool.  It's a letdown that the trailer for the film is not included but their are some really nice extras.  The company that put out this version is called cheezy flicks entertainment.  There is a extras section on the disc that has all kinds of ""cheezy"" old trailers for films as well as old TV commercials that most anyone would really love who appreciates older low budget films and ads.  I really loved that and can't wait to buy more films from cheezy entertainment to see even more of these extras I hope.Spook Meter:  3 Stars.  First off, I LOVED this film.  It's not a overly scary film by any means, but as I watched it, I found my own imagination running wild as scenes popped up like the velvet vampire looking up out of her late husbands grave in the heat of the desert, while she reached out to grab her next victim. I really enjoyed the fact that this was not your ""normal"" vampire film.  How many vampires live in the desert and drive a dune buggy?? The dream scenes, the dry eerie desert scenes, along with the music and 70s phycodelic feel throughout the film really is what made me fall in love with this gem.  I happen to see the name of this film and bought it just based on that, I'm so glad I did.Gore/Violence Meter:  2 Stars.  This is not very gory at all. There is some blood, and there is some violence throughout though.  Scenes of blood where a knife goes into someone, blood is shown after someone is bit on the neck and a few other Simi violent parts but where no blood is shown. The film is not super mild on the gore meter, but will be acceptable for most anyone who enjoys horror with slight gore and violence.Profanity Meter:  3 Stars.  Their is a fair amount of bad language throughout the velvet vampire and was one part that I found to be a bit of a letdown.  Viewers be warned.Sexual Meter:  4 Stars.  There is quite a few make out scenes in this film.  Woman's breasts are shown quite a few times and a mans naked butt is shown.  Nothing else is shown below the waist; however it's quite a bit on the sexual side of things for a horror film so I give the sexual meter pretty high marks as an early warning to all viewers.Final Thoughts:  The velvet vampire is a very special and unique film to watch.  It's got a lot of twists to it that after your done watching you will be left pondering over was if this and what if that.  It's very well done, kind of spooky and will keep you glued to the screen until the credits are shown.  If you can appreciate low budget films and want something that is truly a fun, one of a kind vampire experience, then the velvet vampire will be one that you will be proud to own as I am.",N/A
1032363,"The marvelous film The Illusionist was released in 2006 to reasonable success at the box office. But its art house feel and understated (and excellent)acting apparently appealed to only so many people. It did not make great play with the media and was not splashed across the covers of magazines, with the possible exception of celebrity gossip circles for the youthful Jessica Biel. Even an ardent viewer of films such as myself missed this one at the theater.So, seeing this film two years later on DVD, with little or no fanfare, only added to my pleasure at finding this gem. Director and screen writer Neil Burger effortlessly presents a cat and mouse detective mystery against the backdrop of turn of the century Vienna.  Edward Norton, who plays Eisenheim the Illusionist, and Paul Giamatti, who plays Inspector Uhl, both aptly demonstrate their exceptional acting skill and range.A must see.",N/A

Right from the start, the beloved grandfather has died, and everyone is grieved in ""The Empty Nest 1&2.""

Olivia (Michael Leanerd) finds out she has turberculosis and leaves the Walton family for a while.

He did not win any awards for this role, this damnation, this damned man, a police detective in ""Bad Lieutenant.""There's a song, ""Bad to the Bone,"" which might sum up the detective, or it might not be strong enough because Harvey Keitel's character is bad to the bone and then some. He lives as a family man, but on the edge, clearly not part of this family, a stuffed man, stuffed with aloneness, stuffed with horrors of his own making. Director Abel Ferrara's filming technique extends this isolation by making the movie look like a docudrama. Filmed on location. No takes. Shoot as is. Keep the cameras rolling.He starts the day clean as he drops his two sons off at school. During the course of the day he investigates two vicious murders, a store theft he turns to his advantage by keeping the stolen money, does drugs with a stoned out, emaciated redhead, and engages in a menage-a-trois with two women. During this scene he evens out the equal rights debate for male actors to engage in full frontal nudity. Yes, he does. Then he gets his life-defining case--the vicious rape of a young nun by two local petty drug dealers.Harvey Keitel has spent the day engaged in personal encounters with, well, let's name it, sins of the flesh, of the soul. He sees the nun several times over the next few days, trying to understand what happened to her. When she tells him with her own mouth that she forgives the two men and will not identify them or name them, but only forgives them, he has a major crisis of conscience.One reviewer calls this film a major religious movie, and, indeed, it becomes so. These are scenes to cherish for their truthful beauty, for their naked exposure of a soul in dire peril. Harvey Keitel produces a keening for his soul the like which will make your hair stand on end. The following scenes need to be seen and not read.What transpires resonants with the viewer as the viewer comes to understand the moment's eternal meaning. No more will I say.Note: This movie is rated NC-17 and is not for the squeamish.",N/A

My daughter loves the 2nd one it is her favorite. I dont have a favorite because i love them both. I rank them with Dennis the Menace. They are simular i love all of them.

Then they learn he has been brought back alot. Thats when Mr.Healey(John Ritter)decides they are keeping him. Well in the end it ends up being just Mr.Healey and Jr. Problem Child 2 is about Mr.Healey & Jr moving to make a new start. That's where they meet a little girl named Trixie.

710866,"Here's an engaging tale that's all the more entertaining for its simplicity. Essentially a silent film, save for a few easily understandable words of dialogue in several languages, it takes us into a vaguely Eastern European setting, one that's crumbling & almost post-apocalyptic ... although the apocalypse seems to have been one of quiet neglect & decay, rather than titanic destruction.Anton runs the genteel remains of a once-elegant bathhouse, and his evil brother Gregor wishes to destroy it for development. Eva, a charming & offbeat beauty, is caught between the two brothers, fooled by Gregor's machinations -- whom will she choose? Which brother's worldview will prevail? And there's really very little more to it than that, in terms of plot.But the look & the atmosphere ... ah, there's where the surreal magic lies! Shot in black & white, then hand-tinted with stunning monochromatic colors, the film plays like a dream unfolding before our eyes. The almost cartoon-like leads become more convincing than subtle, three-dimensional characters in such a landscape; and the exaggerated acting style feels just right.There are several individual scenes which convey an innocent, whimsical beauty, such as Eva's nude swim in the bathhouse pool, complete with a goldfish bowl & a goldfish that keeps swimming in & out of the bowl. The nudity is both sexually alluring & cheekily tender, with Eva more of a water sprite than a young woman. And who is free, and who is caught in the illusion of being free?As the film progresses, it reveals unsuspected depths. If the message about choosing between beauty & the utilitarian is familiar, it's repeated to good & necessary effect. And the final admonition to pursue a whole & meaningful life before it's too late is always appropriate, especially in a contemporary world devoted to endless consumption, status & power. Most highly recommended!",Tuvalu

297642,"Yes, great film...perhaps the greatest for myriad reasons many of us know and those who do not should excitedly discover on their own.  But has anyone ever commented until now that in addition to being an examination of the title character, CITIZEN KANE contains a devastating, damning commentary on the basic idiocy of most ""investigative"" reporters - in this case the ""truth""-seeking Thompson.  But was it intentional - or a script oversight - that when Raymond the Butler is giving his two cents worth (in his case actually a thousand bucks worth!) to the meaning of Rosebud.....Thompson - a basic idiot-in-the-shadows (is this then why he is always in shadows?  To show he is the man-in-the-dark...the man who cannot see what is before him? Who can't even do his job well!) - when Thompson is told by Raymond that Kane utters the word ""Rosebud"" both when Susan left him and he pocketed ""something"" and ""that other time"" when he dropped the glass ball - yet Thompson does NOT even ask what the hell the glass ball was! If he had known it was of a snow scene he might have had the wits to trace it back to young Kane's winter of discontent when the bank seized hold of him and stole him from his beloved sleigh.  How dumb could one get?  (Perhaps as dumb as many investigative reporters are who fail to deliver the goods or come up with erroneous nonsense that they pass off as truth - or WMDs?) Anyway - I will forever wonder if Thompson's not picking up the ""ball""(in this case albeit a glass, smashed one) was intentional by the makers of KANE or was Thompson just tired at the end of the day or was this a script glitch?  Also not mentioned - to my knowledge - is the preponderance of fireplaces in the film...leading up to the end one which consumes the secret for all time.  (Notice the fireplace directly behind the young Kane when he is given a new sleigh by Thatcher - portent of things to come.)  One other thing that I have never seen mentioned in commentaries of the film is this:  the great Kane-as-a-boy snow scene....the snowman....it is a forecast of the endless statues that the elder Kane will collect; plus...it somewhat looks like the bald-domed, fatter Kane when we last see him: in the Colorado scene we thereby have child and future man, together.  The fact that a snowman is frozen- as Kane is emotionally frozen (especially at the end of the film after Susan leaves) is another point to be considered. So when we first see the dying Kane he God-like holds his past world in his hand, yet being a limited human being afterall (despite Kane's seeming unlimitness of power and money, etc) he cannot enter the scene in the ball...just like he cannot return to that moment in Time.  Conversely, when we first see Kane as a boy, he is in the world of the glass ball - but that world is also about to be shattered by the adults who plot his future within the confines of the warm boarding house. It is then - from this interior - that we see child Kane framed...as he is also about to  be ""framed"" for a crime he did not commit and sentenced to a life of wealth and riches he never asked for - or may have ever even wanted.  In both cases, however, the dying Kane at the film's opening and the first time we see K as a child - in both instances, he is....alone.  Existentially alone in a frozen world that only the human heart and hearthside can warm. One last thing to anyone familiar with the music of Rachmaninoff:  listen to his magnificent tone poem ""Isle of the Dead"" and you will hear what is essentially the Kane motif throughout it.  I absolutely love the music of Bernard Herrmann but cannot help thinking he was influenced - however subconsciously - by Rachmaninoff's piece.  Even the painting that Rachmaninoff based his tone poem on is reminiscent of Xanadu, somewhat.  Anyway - CITIZEN KANE is the ultimate film about ALL of us....not just powerful, multimillionaire publishers....but ALL of us...because we ALL have a ""Rosebud"" in our souls and minds that will be on our lips when the curtain closes.  ""Rosebud"" is, in its most basic form, the desire we all share to....start again, conquer Time, turn back the clock and NOT have die and end our dreams or our bodies.  This is what ultimately makes KANE....a CITIZEN.",N/A

1007617,"I stole the title of this review from another reviewer here who made the point that the style and themes of this film were hot in the 60's.  ""Nothing's what it seems to be...Life is just a dream, etc.""  With some sex and nudity thrown in.I read the book when it first came out and was entranced by it!  'Don't think I've ever seen the film till now...if I did, it didn't make much of an impression on me.  I found the beginning to be quite interesting.  Michael Caine plays the callow but possibly-talented underachiever very well.  Anna Karina is beautiful and gives her usual soulful performance.  Anthony Quinn is perfect for his role, which is more of a type than an actual person.  Candace Bergen looks good  and her rather wooden style of acting is ok for this part.The story is really interesting and I have the feeling that (again, to quote another reviewer) it could have been a wonderful film.  What that would have taken I don't know.  Perhaps it's presented in too literal a style for a tale that is about not taking things so literally?  I'm not sure, but whatever it would take, this version didn't deliver it.We are presented with one version of ""reality"" after another.  Just when we think that the previous versions were not real and the present one is, then another skin of the onion is peeled off and we are perplexed again.  The problem I had was that I just lost interest in the whole game way before the conclusion.The ideas presented are worthy of thought.  I particularly liked what Anne, the French stewardess, told Niko, that there was something in the core of everyone that has never been touched by anything horrible.  This is pure Course in Miracles and I was happy to see it mentioned here.  It is certainly meritorious to see the callow Niko come to terms with his past behavior, but I wasn't really convinced that he actually changed.  The ideas are bogged down by so much hokey ""magic"" and visual shlock that I could no longer care what the heck was going on.

1131432,"There's little new in director Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster."" However, the emphasis on characterization over violent action is refreshing. Denzel Washington gives a compelling performance as real-life Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, with Russell Crowe equally impressive as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts - the man determined to bring down Lucas' heroin empire. An excellent supporting cast features standout portrayals by Josh Brolin and Oscar-nominated Ruby Dee. Regardless of the predictable outcome, Scott manages to keep the pot boiling for 157 minutes. ""American Gangster"" does not rank with the classic crime epics, but remains a solid achievement.",American Gangster
1032176,"Eward Norton gives a wonderfully understated performance in this historical romance set in Vienna at the turn of the century. He plays a marvelous magician who has fallen in love with a daughter of the aristocracy intended for marriage to the nasty megalomaniac Crown Prince who regards her as a ripe fruit worth picking and then throwing away. How will he win her? By magic obviously.Norton is backed up by a superb performance by Paul Giamatti as a cynical police chief trying to advance his career without entirely giving up his morals. Jessica Biel as the female lead is innocent and lovely.In some ways, this movie is a harmless piece of wish-fulfillment and fantasy rather than an actual exploration of historical themes. But the acting is so good, the photography (the movie was all filmed in the Czech Republic) so lovely, and the music by Philip Glass so haunting that it somehow all works.At the heart of the movie is a mystery never explained: how does the illusionist work his magic? His feats move beyond conventional illusion into the realm of the supernatural. Yet we accept it because the movie has woven its web so well.First-class entertainment!",N/A

1123321,"I was going to give this three stars, but I am sometimes too nice! The only bright spot in this one was the absolutely adorable Abbie Cornish as ""Bess"". And I thought I could only love Charlize Theron, one of the most beautiful women to ever appear on a movie screen!!! Of course I do have somewhat of a crush on Scarlett Johannson, but don't tell Charlize that. But I digress. Throughout ""Lizzie Two"" most of the cast seemed to be sleepwalking. Clive Owen's portrayal was particularly boring. Errol Flynn would've certainly been much better in the role, but alas and alack, he is no longer with us! The battle scene with the Spanish Armada was really dull and pretty much anti-climactic. And oh, those seemingly endless ""big lighting"" effects with Elizabeth. Maybe this should have been titled ""Elizabeth, The Savior Queen"". I think Kapur should've reviewed some of the period pieces from the 30's and 40's. They usually had the required dash and panache that this one lacks. And what was with all those real high shots? Were they supposed to impress us little people? Some directors just fall in love with themselves after a dash of success. George Lucas' Star War series comes to mind. I gave this two stars only because it is still a cut above Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"", the epitomy of a bad ""historical"" movie. Was Mel already on the ""sauce"" when he made that one? (By the way, I really like Mel's ""We Were Soldiers"", just so you don't think I'm anti-Mel.) Some of these folks in the movie business must have a very low opinion of our intelligence. (Do ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" come to mind?) My other pet peeve about this movie and some others concerns the dialogue. Whatever happened to recording the characters dialogue in a clear, distinct manner. Actors should never be speaking whilst turned away from the camera. And I do have a good sound system in my home. About $4,000.00 worth. I get tired of going back over the same line two or three times trying to understand what is being said!!!

452257,"The announcement that Young Frankenstein would be released in Blu-Ray triggered mixed feelings. On the one hand, this is a movie that should be widely available in every format. It's that good. On the other hand, the release of high definition films has spawned yet another generation of empty-headers obsessed with picture quality and ""awesome sound,"" who couldn't tell a good movie from a used diaper. And so, the Internet is littered with glowing ""reviews"" about the spectacular cleanliness of the images on garbage releases like Jumper, So I Married an Axe Murderer, Signs, The 6th Day, Ice Age, and The Rock. It distorts the entire rating system on Amazon by giving four or five stars to trashy movies that happen to look shiny and clean, without ""artifacts"" -- or, it turns out, merit. These same reviewers give high marks to some great films on Blu-Ray, but for all the wrong reasons -- yet another distortion of the ratings system.  (Of course, one could treat movie releases as mere ""products,"" and spend time commenting on how well the hinges work, or how well the packaging is made, or how true the ""blacks"" happen to be. But, why dumb down our culture any further with such dedication to fluff and superficialities? Sure, the studios who are making a mint off of Blu-Ray transfers of lousy films want you to care about such things, but I'll take a VHS of Young Frankenstein on a black and white Philco over a ""glorious"" version of Con Air. So would every other thinking person.)And so, to get to the point, this is Mel Brooks' shining moment, a film that is a brilliantly funny homage to the classic horror films of the thirties.  Some might complain about the corn content, but it works, and the performances by a stellar cast -- topped by Gene Wilder -- are phenomenal.

1120694,"Will this new wave of ""war on terror"" movies ever end? Almost none of them work because: they don't change people's opinions, they pretend to be morally superior (self-importance), they give us the wrong impressions and their messages are way too bias--this is Hollywood after all and we all know which side of the political spectrum they're on--to even take any of them seriously. In the end, these movies turn out to be more offensive (even for the Arabs) than anything else. I'm certain that whatever is happening behind the government's curtain is far more dramatic and interesting than boring films like Rendition--heck! At least The Kingdom had action in it. Not only the film is uninspiring, boring and extremely long, the A-class American actors are so lifeless that seem to be ""pasted"" into the film. I surrendered to Rendition after an hour and change. The real suffering is watching it.Brief Intro Story:An explosion in North Africa generates an investigation to find out the perpetrators--one American is killed. A little bit after that incident, family man Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is kidnapped at the airport by a secret ""law enforcement"" agency--He was supposed catch a plane from South Africa to Chicago. Apparently he is now a suspect of terrorism and taken to a secret location for interrogation--He is a legal US resident and apparently innocent. Meanwhile rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to observe the brutal interrogation of Anwar by the local law enforcement--he was near that explosion, he wants to do his job, but doesn't like what he sees.After waiting for few days, Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) begins to investigate the disappearance of her husband--she is pregnant, but this doesn't stop her from finding out the truth. As the film continues, Douglas begins to have second thoughts about his job and the real truth behind that explosion appears for all to see.Review:Director Gavin Hood makes a bad mistake by creating two parallel stories with no success in any of them. In one hand we have a ""Romeo and Juliet"" soapy Arab love story, and in the other, we get the laid-back and boring CIA agent Douglas who doesn't do much but getting laid, watches poor Anwar being tortured for few days, but all of the sudden, he wants to do the right thing by going against US policy on terror and trying to understand and even help the prisoner--which is not his call. How exciting is that? Even though, these stories are related, the movie jumps from scene to scene lacking the notion of time with fuzzy continuity. This non-chronological approach (done better in other films) unfortunately is not the only editing issue; the film is extremely long (120 minutes). Too long for a film that has virtually no action sequences, but little character development and few forced dramatic moments--for example the torture scenes for the most part, but they are not that shocking.Many of you are wondering why I didn't mention in my introduction that this film has Academy Award-winning Meryl Streep and Academy Award-winning Alan Arkin. What is wrong with this picture? The problem is the way our actors portray their clich&eacute; characters--yes, those evil, heartless government officials in charge of the war on terror (I'm being sarcastic here). In other words, our American actors have very little material--and screen time--to work with. They are nothing but stereotypes that show no emotions even in dire straits situations and at times, seem to be bored to even be in the film. It's an easy paycheck after all. But why is it about Oscar winners that after getting one statue, they get bad roles?The Verdict:Rendition has an agenda and clearly displays it by showing its own view of what's happening to detainees in this messy War on Terror. Of course, you would expect this kind of bias from Hollywood. The real issue here is that the movie is way too slow; it has cero character development with boring performances and clich&eacute; stereotypes--except for few scenes from the prisoner that are quite dramatic--that doesn't inspire nor entertain us. Please do yourself a favor and watch other far better dramas about this issue like Syriana.",N/A

1180460,"Louis Leterrier's `Incredible Hulk' does everything in reverse:  When watching comic action-adventure films, we expect the special effects to be perfect with a script that's flawed.  Not here. With a properly pensive screenplay by Zak Penn, and a sensitive, yet gripping reading by Edward Norton, this `Hulk' gets only what's important right.Briefly Bruce Banner (Norton) hides out in Brazil, trying yoga from an Eastern trainer who can help to keep his temper and heart-rate low to soothe his inner beast.  Contacting an anonymous professor, code named Mr. Blue, in NYC, he sends blood samples to find an antidote to his radiation-afflicted condition.Tracking him from the Pentagon, General Ross (William Hurt) wants to make his gamma-ray rages into the army's new weapon of mass destruction.  On his side is guinea pig wannabe and Brit-accented Maj. Blonsky (Tim Roth) who is Banner and Hulk's nemesis.  Banner is on the run until he can catch up undetected to NYC and try Mr. Blue's hopeful cure to his raging condition.  Threading the main plot is his reunion with the general's daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Ross (an equally terrific Liv Tyler).  Their love brings a decency and tenderness to the film, providing a real antidote to the Frankenstein proceedings.  The father-daughter relationship is pivotal as well.  The movie makes it plain if indeed blood is truly thicker than water.This `Incredible Hulk' gets it right in the software (heart) if not the hardware (special effects).  The emotional context is right as we can only sympathize with Banner's plight.  Seeing the monster and some army maneuvering we're made so aware of the digitalized effects, I felt sometimes like I was watching the stiffness of video game graphics.  The running chases are far more impressive.  When the director gets up close to the scenes as they pass by, the effect is properly enthralling.  The suspenseful mood is often present, and the time it takes to tell the story is laudably spare.  Praiseworthy themes such as bio-ethics and combat ethics are explicitly weaved through the story.  It's also good to see William Hurt with a fresh performance as a crusty martinet after some stale roles.  I did feel the ending was a bit of a roadblock.  Smacking of signaled sequels, the ending made me feel I was a theatre-goer of old watching a serial drama.  Just tune in next year.

917359,"I probably should have realized that the WARRIAH~! parted on poor terms with the WWF in 1996, but I hadn't realized just how poor they were.This documentary is rather entertaining, with lots of footage of the ULTIMATE WARRIAH~! but for the most part... it's not a ""documentary""; it's commentary.While people like Edge, Jericho, and Christian seem to respect the WARRIAH~!, everyone else just absolutely s***s on the man every moment they can after the opening pleasantries about how big an impact he made on the business!Every other scene features Hulk Hogan or Ted DiBiase or Bobby Heenan or Sergeant Slaughter or Steve Lombardi or Bruce Prichard or Gene Oakerlund s***ing on the WARRIAH~!  Every chance they can, they keep saying how awful a wrestler WARRIAH~! was, which in the case of some people (Hulk Hogan much?) is the equivalent of the Pot approaching the Kettle and saying ""You are black"".Obviously WARRIAH~! was nowhere near a decent wrestler at the time, but the fact that his peers constantly remark just how awful he is is insulting and a blatant ""hitjob"" to tarnish his skills.  The fact is, while his skills weren't likely very good, they were about on par with much of the WWF's in-ring quality of the time.  Is the WARRIAH~! a bad wrestler?  Yes.  Is he substantially worse than Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Rick Rude, Sergeant Slaughter?  Absolutely not.  The WWF's in-ring style in the mid-late 80s and early 90s was what is called by some ""hoss"" style, meaning a heavy emphasis on ""big"" guys (muscly or tall) and little to no emphasis on actual athletic talent.  This was in the era where Vince's Big and Tall fetish was running rampant.Even after showing the part regarding WARRIAH~!'s Wrestlemania victory over Hogan, they CONTINUE to s*** all over WARRIAH~!'s skill, and go on to start PRAISING HOGAN as if he were the superstar for so graciously ""passing the torch"" to Hogan, while Jericho, Edge, and Christian have the decency to say that WARRIAH~! could put on great matches with great opponents.Before this DVD, I had figured the ULTIMATE WARRIAH~! had had some sort of colossal mental breakdown or devolving into serious drug use or something to warrant such a title as ""The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"".  Instead, it starts ALL OF A SUDDEN in early 1991, after continuous WARRIAH~! bashing and a quick overview of his feuds with Rick Rude and Randy Savage.ALL OF A SUDDEN at the Royal Rumble, it's said that WARRIAH~! basically held up Vince for more money, saying he wouldn't go out and perform unless he got paid a certain amount.  I agree that this is a really piss-poor unprofessional thing to do, but the talking-head commentary takes this event and runs with it for the next ten minutes, bashing and bashing how awful and evil a man WARRIAH~! is and how arrogant he is and how bad a wrestler he is (take a shot) and how ungrateful he is.Then comes his lawsuit in 1993, changing his name to Warrior, and returning to the WWF in 1996, only to be fired again for no-showing and demanding more money.  Again, this is a bad thing, but hardly anything like ""self destruction"".Perhaps his brief time in WCW could explain the whole ""self destruction"" part, and it does... for five minutes.  And only covering one promo.  ONE!  WARRIAH~!'s first coming to WCW, where he had a 15 minute rambling promo on Hulk Hogan that, due to WCW's own incompetence and lack of leadershipm was completely unscripted, nonsensical, redundant, and absolutely mad and out of control.And that's it.  Then they go on to show his match against Hogan from Halloween Havoc 98, arguably one of the worst in history.Then it ends with some brief mention of his speaking tours, which unfortunately they can't show any footage of (I would've given this DVD five stars if they just had the footage or at least mention of that damn chestnut of WARRIAH~! wisdom ""Queering doesn't make the world work""*), and that's it.So what we have is a fun collection of videos of WARRIAH~!, accompanied by a total hitjob of bashing and heavily biased commentary, boiling down to Christian, Edge, and Jericho respecting WARRIAH~! for his contributions to the business, and the rest hating WARRIAH~! and hoping he burns in hell (exaggeration, but close enough).Also, bonus matches~!  But why would you want to watch a WARRIAH~! match?*I completely disagree with this statement and believe it is wrong and in poor taste.  However, I happen to find it a hilarious statement due to the sheer ridiculousness and tastelessness of it.",The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior
1220350,"The ESPN special that aired nationally on December 13, 2008, was a fabulous walk onto a gridiron of dreams and the piecing together of an incredible historical moment for professional football.In cooperation with NFL Films, ESPN Films produced this special look back on the 1958 NFL Championship, which was captured in overtime by the visiting Baltimore Colts over the New York Giants, 23-17, in the cavernous Yankee Stadium, with a powerful one-yard run by fullback Alan Ameche.Utilizing a number of sources for film, NFL Films essentially rebuilt the game; it was mastered for HD and digitally colored. Host Chris Berman fills in the gaps in the play and smartly tackles the task in a low-key, serious approach.For additional commentary, players from the contest are teamed with players from the recent Super Bowl championship squads of the Giants and Indianapolis Colts. Colts legend Art Donovan and the recently retired Giants great Michael Strahan steal those segments through solid takes and allowing their great personalities to reach paydirt.Kickers Pat Summerall and Adam Vinatieri - another Giants-Colts pairing - provide valuable insight on this often overlooked specialty. The excitement and appreciation for the game shows with cerebral Colts coach Tony Dungy and the vivid details from radio announcer Bob Woolf is worth the price of admission.A fascinating look into the science of measuring a first down from a half-century ago is explained through a controversial run by Frank Gifford, as the Giants failed to put the game on ice as the clock ticked down to the closing minutes. In the melee - which included a delay due to Colt defensive end Gino Marchetti breaking his leg - allegations flew from the Giants that the football was moved back by a Colt player or the spot was incorrect by officials. Technology definitely answers the questions surrounding the play.An estimated 45 million people watched the game on TV, but it was blacked out in the greater New York City area because it was not sold out. And if a pulled plug wasn't fixed in a unique way during overtime, NBC may have had a mess of ""Heidi Bowl"" proportions.Summerall joked about the number of people who have told him that they attended the game. Through this DVD, future generations will have a real cozy seat for one grand slam of a duel on the frozen tundra in ""The House That Ruth Built.""",The Greatest Game Ever Played
1072660,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie to be totally honest.  I mean, come on, another ""dolls come to life and kill innocent people"" movie?  How many of those have their been?  How can this movie do what hasn't been done a thousand times already?Well, maybe Dead Silence doesn't break any new ground in the horror genre, and truthfully the movie certainly isn't miles above other similar kinds of horror storylines due to falling victim to ordinary Hollywood cinematography and cliches, but what it succeeds in doing is scaring the living heck out of me, and the best thing of all is that the dolls (or rather, one doll- a ventriloquist dummy) is unpredictable in how he choses to torture and kill people.In other words, the doll doesn't always come to life at the moment the characters turn their backs unlike other scary movies I've seen before that do.  Oh sure, *sometimes* the dummy doll turns murderous the moment someone turns around, but most of the time not.  This is a surprising highlight for me and adds a bit of creativity to the horror genre.  You're never sure when he's going to strike.The story involving the old crabby attitude doll-obsessed lady who's the ventriloquist and becomes one with the dummies so to speak, and the creepy old man in a wheelchair who's the father of the main character (played by Ryan Kwanten) are both fantastic actors, as is Ryan himself.  I wish the police detective wasn't so stereotypical though- a real downer there.  Of *course* he's going to accuse Ryan of killing his wife when Ryan desperately explains that the real killer is the dummy, but the writing is sort of terrible whenever the cop appears.  Oh well, minor complaint.Of course we probably ALL get the creeps when thinking about dolls moving their eyeballs around, and that happens here on a few occasions.  The scene where Ryan is driving the dummy to a cemetery to bury him forever only for the doll to suddenly turn his head/eyes towards Ryan is unbelievably creepy!The storyline is really good too, because it's half mystery/half horror.  The story works most of the time, because there's tons of suspense, and you get the feeling something frightening is going to happen at any moment.  That's where the movie succeeds- not knowing what's about to happen while building suspense.Another thing that scares the pants straight off my legs is what happens just BEFORE the dummy goes into ""killing mode"".  The surroundings gradually become quiet, and the atmosphere would greatly intensify before finally reaching a temporary standstill.  Anything making a sound gives off this frightening dying sound (similar to playing a cassette tape in a tape player with low batteries and hearing the sound of the voices become deeper and slower).  REALLY awesome experience!  Then the characters hear nothing but silence (hence the name of the movie) prompting the dummy to do his cold-hearted killing spree on whoever's around.Very good movie but doesn't have any replay value I'm afraid- after the first viewing it's not NEARLY as chillingly effective after that.",Dead Silence

In the lead role he plays a promiscuous player with very strict rules which disallow emotional engagement.  On the surface he is a pig but he plays the part charmingly. It really is difficult to imagine this refined man in such a role.Michelle Monaghan, his co-star, plays his best friend of ten years (after a chance meeting in college when he was seeking his next conquest).

When he knows he will lose his best friend, Tom (Dempsey) rethinks his relationship, especially after she asks him to be her maid of honor.The rest of the movie is his quest to attain the lovely Hannah as HIS wife, not as the handsome Scotsman's.

1165102,"I'm as sad as many others to see Foyle's War end.  What is so great about this series is that one can watch any of the stories repeatedly and enjoy it as much the fifth time as the first--and catch new subtleties with each viewing.The three episodes of set 5 are as well done as the previous seasons.  They begin in time with April, 1944 and are spaced approximately six months apart.  As with previous plots, events of the time are carefully interwoven into each story.  Characterizations of DCS Foyle, Sgt. Milner, and the delightful Sam Stewart are as convincing as always.Some characters from earlier episodes return, including Captain (now Major) Kieffer, the mysterious Miss Pierce, and Milner's love, Edith, who is played by Polly Maberly in replacement of Caroline Martin.  It would have been nice to see Barbara (played by Stella Gonet) from 'They Fought In The Fields' return but she does not.Comments by series creator and writer Anthony Horowitz are part of the extras and his remarks help explain why the series ends as it does.  I think Horowitz really knew what he was doing, and while there are people I wanted to see return, such as the Barbara character, I can appreciate that Horowitz chose not to develop the series as Aaron Spelling might have done.  British reserve is a wonderful quality.Guest stars of the final three episodes give outstanding performances.  They are perhaps not familiar names to American audiences but their performances convey a sense of different time and place. Natasha Little (who played Becky Sharp in the A&E; version of Vanity Fair) is most believable as a farm wife in the 2nd episode, 'Broken Souls', and Nicholas Woodeson is marvelous as a troubled Polish psychiatrist in the same episode.I have to admit I would not mind at all if Horowitz came up with a series for Anthony Howell as Milner in a post-war setting.Foyles's War has truly been wonderful to watch and will continue to be so.",Foyle's War: Set Five

130065,"I just finished watching this set and I can honestly say that I was blown away by the picture quality for all 3 films.There's not much you can say about these movies that hasn't been said before. They're beloved and classic adventure films that many other movies (Mummy,Tomb Raider,etc.) have tried to copy but never could. In all honesty though, I must say that I really only prefer Raiders and Temple of Doom. Last Crusade comes off as goofy and lightweight compared to it's predecessors. But even Crusade looks a little better now compared to the new and atrocious Crystal Skull, or Numb Skull as I like to call it. But I won't get started on how laughably bad that one is as I won't be able to stop. I'll save that for it's own dvd review. Raiders is still the best though and provides all the classic moments, characters, and action that make Indiana Jones so great.I used to watch these movies alot on vhs when I was younger but I never got the last set on dvd. I also hadn't seen them, except on t.v., for quite a while. I took advantage of a sale for this newly released box set and I just can't get over how good they look. I watched them using an upconverting dvd player via HDMI to my HDTV and they almost look like they could be HD DVD's or Blu Ray's. They colors are robust, the edges are sharp, details pop, and the transfers are very clean. I usually inspect movies from a tech point of view as I'm kind of a audio and videophile and none of the transfers ever came across as dirty or grainy. There are maybe few instances when you may see a spec or spot but you have to look for them. I wish all remasters got this kind of treatment.I listened to them on my home theater and each movie sounded better than the last. Given the fact that they were originally mono 2.0 tracks, I think they did a very good job converting them to 5.1. Raiders came across the weakest of the bunch as Temple and Crusade feature much fuller, bass filled tracks. But considering it's age, it was still pretty good.I've read that the DD 5.1 tacks are the same from the last box set but that the video is superior here. Some of the extras are different from the sets too. They've added a couple of new ones here but removed alot of the documentary style ones from the last set as it had a separate disc to contain them. They didn't have the room to include them here but I'm wondering why they didn't just add the extras disc from the last set to complete it.Overall, this is simply a no-brainer must have for any fan of the series. If you already have the last set, you may just be happy to keep it, especially if you like extras. If you don't have either set, you'll select one based on where your priorities are. Either video quality or extras seem to be the only differences. Personally, I'd rather have better audio and video, but that's just me. I don't think you can go wrong no matter which you choose and you'll be happy either way. Recommended.",N/A

After her marriage, she learns that someone from her past has been paroled from prison and is stalking her.

1059238,"2005's ""Night in the Museum"" features Ben Stiller as Larry Daley, a dreamy, down on his luck, divorced father who needs a job.  That job turns out to be night watchman at the famous American Museum of Natural History, right next to New York City's Central Park.  Larry gets a quick briefing from the three retiring nightwatchmen he is replacing (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobb in a marvelous cameo) and takes up his duties.  However, Larry is stunned to find that as the sun goes down, the Museum's various exhibits come to life.Larry's first night is an hilarious panic-driven flight through the halls from hungry lions, angry Huns, and a mischevious monkey.  Larry is saved by a wax figurine of Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams), who provides some vital advice and encouragement.  Larry is ready to quit, but the need to prove to his skeptical son that he can be responsible brings him back to duty the next night, where his efforts to control the chaos are equally funny, but only marginally successful.Larry's third night will be his real trial by fire.  Larry has invited his son to spend the night in the museum with him, but is badly embarrassed when nothing happens at sundown.  Larry discovers that the three retiring watchman have stolen a golden Egyptian tablet that animates the Museum exhibits.  He is able to retrieve the tablet just long enough to reanimate the museum exhibits but then loses control of the watchmen, the tablet, and the exhibits.  In desperation, Larry must mobilize the exhibits to save the day.""Night in the Museum"" is proof that CGI can make almost anything look believable.  Among other challenges, Larry credibly interacts with a talking Easter Island head, a playful dinosaur skeleton, and hundreds of diorama cowboys and Roman legionaires.  The humor is family-oriented as Stiller mugs and deadpans his way through a series of improbable, over-the-top situations.  Owen Wilson has a nice turn as a frustrated minature cowboy, while Carla Gugino plays a sympathetic museum employee and potential love interest.  Stick around for the credits to see Dick Van Dyke prove he can still dance.  This comedy is highly recommended as good laugh-out-loud family entertainment.",N/A

282860,"This movie is inimitable.Terse, convoluted, gritty, and satirical. The scenes of this movie pack a visceral punch rarely matched in classic Hollywood movies.The plot is confusing, if not incomprehensible at times. However, the basics are pretty straightforward. Sam Spade is a private eye working in San Fransisco with his partner. One afternoon a beautiful, malevolent women walks into Spade's office, paying him and his partner (Miles Archer) to find her sister. She claims her sister is in grave danger. She is, of course, lying. Her real goals are hidden, but slowly revealed as the movie progresses. Unfortunately her little ruse ends up getting Spade's partner killed. Thus is unleashed a complex series of events.The plot focuses on Spade's attempt to keep up with the criminal elements around him. It seems every one is machiavellian, and the underworld Spade belongs to is byzantine in its betrayals, double-crossings, and machinations. The people he talks to are inveterate liars. One gets vertigo trying to make sense of it all. This makes us all the more amazed that Spade can keep his cool. Oddly, it turns out all the fuss in the movie has to do with the statue of a Maltese Falcon. An object worth killing and dying for.Spade plays crooked, but deep down inside he is a Kantian. His ethical nature, stoic exterior, and masculine facade, make him irresistable as a protaganist. This is the movie that marked the rise of Bogart the superhuman-and rightfully so.The Maltese Falcon is a rich movie, with myriad meanings. One of the major themes is the quest for an unattainable object and the havoc such a quest can cause. After all, the dead bodies in this movie accumulated over nothing more than the silly statue of a bird! It is interesting to compare the Maltese Falcon with Don Quixote. Both works contain the mythological heroic quest. However, in Quixote, the quest is needed to sustain life. Without it, Quixote dies. In the Maltese Falcon the quest causes death. When the quest is over, sanity is restored. This is an interesting contrast, and one well worth pondering.Is the quest worth while? Or, should we stay sane and firmly planted on the sinful streets of the world?In the end, it is hard to find any flaws in this movie. There are no superfluous scenes, nor is there any hint of condescending directing. Just straight to the point, action and dialogue packed delivery.Brilliant!",N/A

A helpless hopeful who works for a publishing company and constanly gets himself into trouble by dreaming his life more fantastic. Whether it be doctor, fighter pilot or gambling gentleman, he becomes the man he wishes he could be but is absolutely not. Charming, debonaire, brave and sophisticated. The real Walter Mitty posesses none of these attributes.Things take a turn for him though as he finds himself mixed up with a beautiful woman who's in trouble and involved in a dangerous plan to retrieve a book containing locations for some hidden WWII paintings. A former nazi named ""The Boot"" is also aware of the book and will kill anyone in the way of securing it for himself.Unfortunately for Walter, no one knows or believes his story as these people who constantly call on him for help are never around when anyone else is. His Boss, co-workers, and family all chalk it up to his wild imaginations and story writing career. This all makes for some funny moments where Walters secret life soon becomes his real life. But nobody knows it but him.Danny Kaye does a wonderful job of selling every performance he's asked to. Every character he plays is totally different from the other and is a tribute to his versitility. He absolutely sells this movie and makes it work. A great performance. Keep an eye out for Boris Karloff in his psychiatrist role as well.The disc works well for what it is. The color looks very good and natural. Overall, it's pretty clean and doesn't cause any unnecessary distractions. The audio is typically mono and focused to the front speakers. Everything is clearly heard and distinguishable.

1184047,"Act of God- A direct and sudden event or action of certain unexplainable forces that could not be reasonably foreseen; it compromises all evidence and defies all attempts at explanation by Science.THE HAPPENING is writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's latest outing after his somewhat disappointing ""Lady in the Water"". This director's films are lyrical in tone but often has a darkness in their proceedings; Shyamalan`s films are also thematic in their execution and ""The Happening"" is no different. Pronounced as his first ""R-Rated"" film, this latest offering is as imaginative as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"". His films are a ""hit"" or a ""miss"", I'm not a solid fan but his films are certainly original. Certain viewers will probably feel a bit alienated because of its main premise, but no one can deny that the film does explore humanity`s greatest threat: the unknown and the unexplainable.One morning, in a major city in the U.S., everyone seems to be minding their own business, doing their chores, working their shifts, until suddenly, a barrage of unexplainable suicides happen one after the other. Citizens commit violence against themselves and the only explanation the media can offer is a terrorist attack or a deadly toxin released by either terrorists and then plants. Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher who bases most things on deductive reasoning and logical explanations; has to flee the city for the countryside with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel) together with a small group of survivors to try to escape the invisible threat. However, what they come across with may defy all semblances of logical human explanation.Shyamalan may have summoned the bleakest array of disturbing images in the film's beginning. The nightmare and mayhem by eventual suicides are thoroughly visible; hairpins are driven to jugulars, construction workers jumping off buildings, cops shooting themselves, people crawling under their own lawnmowers, zoo keepers offering themselves as a the main course to lions. The director offers a lot of truly bleak hysteria and will definitely make your skin crawl. The images are full of intense sequences of mass suicide especially in the first act, which is worthy of the price of a movie ticket by itself. It is dark, moody and bleak that will definitely leave some viewers very affected as it dishes out all the lurid details.The film emulates a very strong feeling of the unknown and further accentuated by the confused media broadcasts which attempt to explain the phenomena. Elliot has his own theories as well as a kindly farmer which he has crossed paths with. There is also a feeling of helplessness as our cast finds themselves fleeing from one path to another, avoiding heavily populated places with large amounts of deaths. Human panic and fear is also explored with a very bleak execution. Some may say that Shyamalan missed some opportunities as the film seems like a rethread of his film, ""Signs"", with a family caught in all the chaos. While this may be so in a way, I do think that ""The Happening"" is a lot more intense with its premise and its ability to unnerve is more omnipresent.Elliot offers some theories of the `event' as Wahlberg makes his best expressions of being puzzled, flabbergasted and confused. This man has been on a roll lately, I liked him in ""Shooter"" and ""The Departed""; Markie-mark pulls off a very decent performance. His supporting cast isn't so bad either. The dialogue still has the usual ""quippy"" remarks as is reminiscent in Shyamalan's ""Signs"" that are also an acceptable practice to tone down its bleakness somehow and to express different personalities in a certain situation. I liked the nice touches by the director as he shows the blowing wind as a harbinger of doom, as if a mighty hand envelopes the surroundings with an irresistible force. The only fault the film may have is that it seemed to run a little out of gas near the final act, as he somehow exhausts his ideas. Don't get me wrong, it's just that it may be near-impossible to keep up such a powerful start.It's impossible for me to say anything more without spoiling the film, the film is a cannon of a horror film in its first act. Complemented with a very bleak tone that stays within a lyrical execution and a good soundtrack, with Wahlberg's confused looks, ""The Happening"" is a satisfying diversion. Its main theme of the unknown promises a change of pace and some viewers may argue that it still followed the same formulas. The film may be somewhat hampered with familiar rethreads of a chase film but it`s overshadowed by what its trying to say. If you're familiar with this director's films; you'll know that he has certain motifs and themes, it's not so much with dealing with answers but asking the answers.The film's climax may disappoint some viewers as the film never does offer any solid answers; which is the whole point. I can just hear them now; so what was the cause? I thought it was quite good for Shyamalan to encourage these questions, but those who like being spoon-fed the details should just stay away. After all, how do you explain an ""ACT OF GOD""?Recommended! [3  + Stars]",N/A

1140037,"As I have mention in my extremely few Japanese Animation movie reviews I have not been a fan. But if more films like ""VEXILLE"" are produced I may just have to buy them. To me this is more of a Sci-Fi Anime film with lots of action. And an original score that enhances the viewing pleasure.In this movie we have Daiwa Industries, a Japanese technological giant, making huge leaps of advancements in robotics. They have taken the technology so far that the world is worried about what direction they will take their research. With revelations of their experimenting with bioengineering of humans, the U.N. with the assent of the rest of the world place strict limits on the use of robotic technology.With this edict form the U.N., Japan decides to withdraw from the U.N. and is able to completely seal off Japan from all prying eyes by use of a magnetic force field around its borders. But ten years later the U.S.A. learns that Daiwa may have perfected a procedure to turn humans into cyborgs and give them an appearance of having human biometrics.This is the critical information that is needed to make S.W.O.R.D., a black op organization that is outside the protection of all nations, take action. With plausibly deniability in place, S.W.O.R.D. is ordered to infiltrate Japan and find out how far their research has progressed and too see if they are developing forbidden robotic biotechnology!I found this a very entertaining Sci-Fi film with tried and true formula of man fighting machine.

654196,"I generally liked the beginning of this film that had a premise that all humans have their own ""demons"".  Demons grow as the soul of their owners grows.  They are also the opposite sex of their human counterparts (i.e. girl would have a male demon and vice versa) and take animal form.  In the beggining young adults have spirit that is free and uncompromising; but the local ""ministry"" wants them to obey and conform unconditionally.  So this is a universal battle of good and evil in its psychological form.  There is also a metaphysical component of the movie where narrator mentions parallel universe and people form the parallel world that are connected by the universal ""dust"". I liked the fact that the main character of the film is a girl - that premise gives some hope to humanity of this little made up universe.  Also the visual effects are great.  Most ""demons"" are such fantastic animals full of personality and charm.  cast is definitely superior, but by the middle of the film - story starts to fade and becomes boring.  It is probably a moment where reading the book would be more interesting than watching this story unfold.  I cannot tell you how this film ends because, unfortunately I fell asleep at the end of it.

Edward asked Carter if he rather go home to his family and have them adjust their lives and routines around his disease or celebrate what time was left?If you can take the leap of faith that terminal patients can run off for months without a care and enjoy every minute they have left - you get the message of the film and enjoy the life, love, laughter.",The Bucket List
706139,"...and therefore his greatest opera!That's not an opinion shared by everyone, I know, but watching and listening to this production by the Metropolitan Opera might concern a few. Verdi himself thought, as he put it, that he'd done something worthwhile with Simon Boccanegra, and he revised it and promoted it assiduously. In no other opera is his music so consistent, both in melodic invention and in sustained development. The aesthetic failings of earlier operas, in my ears, were their episodic unevenness and an ever-present possibility of lapsing into schmaltzy bumptiousness just at the wrong moment. In Simon Boccanegra, Verdi achieves a unity of voices and orchestra, of song and symphony that opera lovers are more likely to expect from Wagner. But Verdi never lets his musical invention stagnate into bombast. Conductor James Levine takes a few passages on this recording a little too briskly and bouncily, mostly in the first scenes, but the superb musicianship of the Met orchestra fills Verdi's score with an opulence that matches the visual splendor of sets and costumes extravagant even by New York standards. The only visible flaw in the production is the weathered face of Placido Domingo, decades too old for the role of Adorno, but who could want to replace him with a prettier face when he sings so heroically? Kiri Te Kanawa is divine in the role of Maria/Amelia, Adorno's lver and Boccanegra's lost daughter. The love story, however, is secondary to the tale of hatred and reconciliation, acted out by the two old men, Simon and his vengeful enemy Jacopo Fiesco, sung by baritones Vladimir Chernov and Robert Lloyd. I have heard more beautiful male voices - most recently that of Dmitri Hvorostosky and Vitalij Kowaljow as Boccanegra and Fiesco in the current San Francisco production - but Chernov and Lloyd compensate for their vocal roughness with powerful expressiveness. Camera work is way good, as they say in Hollywood, and the recording quality is clear and well balanced between stage and orchestra pit. Even the subtitles are better than average - more accurate and more ample.Critics and program writers often declare that Simon Boccanegra is difficult to stage. There's an awkward jump of 25 years between the first act and the principal drama of the 2nd--4th acts. There are several improbable coincidences... but what opera lacks its improbabilities? None of that detracts, to my mind, from the dramatic grandeur of Verdi's concept, of the father-daughter bond that overcomes implacable enmity and reptilian betrayal. The libretto is not without melodrama, but it approaches Shakespearean tragedy far closer than the operas like Othello and MacBeth that Verdi based on actual Shakespeare plays. Believe me, folks won't go home from Simon Boccanegra saying ""great singing but what a dumb plot!""","Verdi - Simon Boccanegra / Levine, Te Kanawa, Metropolitan Opera"

It adds a great twist to several of her NY murders. There are episodes with old friends from other shows, like Michael the spy. All in all it is a great season with added characters from her NY domicile. My favorite episode from this season is #9. She makes history by being the first female author to stand where Hemingway and Sanburg stood to read at a literary club, for men only. I can't wait for the next season to come out.",N/A

973657,"Murder, Inc. (1960) is worth renting as a DVD, for the simple reason thatit shows the ugliness of murder, rubouts, contract killings in a Post-Prohibitionera, during which various gangs cooperated in a national syndicate, for profitmaximization as opposed to rival gangs competing for the same turf.In fact, the gangs now prefer taking the low key approach, staying off the radar screen oflaw enforcement. The biggest profit generators the movies suggests, are shakedowns of themanagement of a company, by micromanaging the labor unions and their ability to strike andhold the company hostage for a large pay increase unless the underworld is used to mitigatethe union's greed, or so they say. Another one, is the protection money requiredfrom shopkeepers, under the risk of retaliation and complete destruction of their livelihood(  of the actual productive assets and inventory) should they refuse and resist payment.This work is completely non-glossy in terms of a film, as it shows the underbelly of crime,and the actual implications of taking part in the underworld, once the gang draws theattention of law enforcement and the top bosses rub out their own helping hands, to avoidbeing connected with the dastardly deeds they ordered be carried out.One of the few artistic merits of their work, is the clarity, sharpness and good editingcoupled with the great wide-screen release, while the story itself (the script) is mixedwith a sentimental love story (perhaps not grounded in reality) to keep viewers interesteddespite  the hard hitting facts. Clearly, this movie was intended  as an ""educational tool""by the police, to discourage crime and enlighten youth from partaking in profit generatingbut illegal behavior.Centered in Brooklyn, NY in the 1930's,  the film is modern except for the telephones, andautomobiles shown, whereas the rest has stood the test of time.The protagnonist, Falk, is an enigma, as sometimes he appears aloof,  like a sitting duckor Momma's Boy,  but at other times, able to transform himself as a hard hitting criminal,keen to violence,  even to ruthlessness and generosity so long as it suits his agenda, evenrape. His oversized coat draws away from the movie's credibility, as it looks it just cameoff the clothes rack, spotless, no dust.It also  gives horse betting and pawnshop keepers a bad name, as shylocking and betting iscondoned.The movie is also brave, in terms of the mini skirts of the dancing girls shown on screen,as the gangsters enjoy the entertainment of night clubs as well as crooners and the girls.The story is valuable in showing how peer and economic pressures can sometimes push anhonest but vulnerable man to get involved in criminal activities, even when simply drivingor cooperating on a contract, vs. pulling the trigger.For those familiar with the hierarchy found in the military, that of the underworldsyndicate is much alike, in the expectation of taking orders from the top without askingquestions, and respecting higher ranked individuals in the movement.The psychology of criminals is also portrayed as that of  greedy individuals, who areunable  to tame their desires and impulses. Falk yells "" Whatever I want, I take! That'swhat hands are for! To take!""Bizarrely, the script is critical and mocking of showgirls as  worthy housewives, as theycan't cook, (boil an egg), dress themselves decently or even maintain an interestingconversation. It also associates those characteristics with  women from European countries,who arrive to the USA, as opposed to home grown USA women.Overall, the story tells how 200 murders in 2 years were committed in Brooklyn alone, by asmall gang for maximizing their underworld revenue generation operations.The story touches slightly on the law, in terms of Habeas Corpus, and corroboratingwitnesseses and subpoenas and the like - needed in preparation of a court date,  and how,at the end of the day, st00l pigeons are a gang's archilles heel.","Murder, Inc.

1092969,"So much of the reputation of Knocked Up concerns its oftentimes juvenile sensibility.  This standing is not without cause, as the film is littered with jokes bout flatulence, websites devoted to nudity in movies and endless misogynistic and homophobic humor.  But somewhere lost in the cultural dialogue of this film is its heart, which focuses on two young people propelled into a situation neither is ready to tackle, but who are both seemingly motivated by good intentions and a desire to make the situation work.The young adults are the mismatched pair Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and Ben Stone (Seth Rogen).  Scott is an up-and-coming assistant to Ryan Seacrest (in a great role where he lampoons himself), and Stone is a slacker who has parlayed a small settlement in a traffic accident into a life where he can sleep all day, smoke pot with his friends and dream about a huge payday earned from building the Mecca of adult websites. .Despite his lack of goals, money, good looks or social qualms, there's something just boyish and rascally about Stone that allows him to one night hit the beer goggle jackpot when he somehow finds himself in Scotts bed.  The two part ways, never expecting to see each other again, until the morning sickness comes a-knocking and Scott learns her one night of drunken decadence produced a spawn.The difficulties and joyous anticipation leading up the birth account for the meat of Knocked Up, as the two  attempt to find common ground and really want to love each other.  From it's packaging and considering the film is the product of the minds behind The 40-Year Old Virgin, the laughs were to expected, but the touching life journey is a surprise.  Writer/Director Judd Apatow hit's the magical formula of appealing both to the funny bone of vulgar young boys and to the Kleenex-taxing desires of middle-aged women.",Knocked Up
1023955,"""When the Levees Broke"" is Spike Lee's eloquent portrayal of the events and personalities of New Orleans who struggled in August 2005 and beyond through the assault and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Lee uses first-person accounts from those who left town early and those who withstood the storm and the difficult recovery period afterwards. Officials and celebrities like Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, controversial New Orleans Policy Chief Eddie Compass and musician Wynton Marsalis are interviewed. But the ordinary people of New Orleans --good, bad and otherwise -- are the heroes of the film, and Lee gives the lion's share of screen time.Lee subtly addresses some of the myths that have grown up around Katrina. He uses newsroom tape of FEMA head Mike Brown and George Bush to make it clear that government knew how bad the coming storm was. He makes it clear also that all sorts of folks - black and white -- took the initiative to get out of town before the storm hit. And he tries to explain why so many, including those with few means -- the poor, elderly and sick of all colors - stayed behind to fend for themselves. Many who stayed were unable to leave due to illness of incapacity. Others seemed deeply conflicted about evacuating - choosing to remain close to home, a home often purchased at great cost in money and time.Lee lets residents be themselves, even when they make mistakes. He shows them airing ridiculous-sounding rumors, like the claim that the enormous explosions heard during the storm were from the levees being deliberately blown up. But Lee respects the residents enough Lee gives context to this fear, citing an earlier occasion when levees *were* dynamited. Lee documents nave residents flocking to the Superdome, believing that help was on its way, and assuming that government aid would soon arrive, as it did during 9/11 and other national emergencies. But the anguish of the residents is in plain sight. Shots of elderly residents brought back to view wrecked homes - the results of a lifetime of labor and love - are heartbreaking.The film shows Nagin and Blanco in far better light than they are normally shown. The Bush administration does not come off as well, and no federal officials were interviewed for the film, a serious shortcoming if intentional. Nagin, Blanco and others were nowhere near perfect in their reaction to the storm, but a legitimate question is whether the feds tried to cover their sins by spreading the blame down the chain of command.The film's first two discs comprise Acts I-IV, the main part of the film, describing the approach of the storm, its fury, the immediate aftermath and the dispersal of New Orleans' citizens across the nation. Disc 3 contains additional material focusing in the efforts Sean Penn, author Douglas Brinkley and others to rescue New Orleans residents. This disk spotlights the disorganization and incompetence that surrounded the post-Katrina response. The role of police seemed to have become preventing people from fleeing the city and using the stocks of police boats needed to rescue friends and family. Hearing first-hand tales of rescuers -- of residents trapped in their attics, of the non-involvement of police, of the complete absence of Red Cross or FEMA in the first days of the disaster, of insurers returning pittances for destroyed homes-- was harrowing and inexplicable. In the absence of explanations, no wonder people have thought the worst - that class, color and greed were driving the official response.Lee's film is a master work of the documentary form. Using images, mournful music and first-hand testimony, he builds an edifice of truth-telling that is far grander than the individual timbers that went into its construction. His pastiche of the faces, voices and emotions of New Orleanians most eloquently raises questions about the proper role of government. Is government a means of enriching oneself and one's friends, of satisfying one's personal ambitions or of flattering one's ego? Or is it, as some old document says, is instituted to ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity""? Whatever your answer, Lee's film shows government falling down in a big way when Katrina came storming into the Gulf in 2005. By showing us the results of government gone wrong, abetted by unaddressed poverty, hopelessness, dependence and racism, and assisted by official neglect, accidents and incompetence.Lee raises many questions and answers few. He does not (perhaps could not) interview everyone who might have shed light on his subject. He may even try too hard to prove a racist intent for the horrible things that went wrong in New Orleans. But the devastation he filmed - not just of buildings and possessions but of spirit, pride and hope - ought to haunt the viewer long after the end credits finish rolling. Lee does his best to end his work on a positive note. This sometimes seems like painting a happy smile on a corpse. Yet he wants to be hopeful, as hopeful as the people of New Orleans are themselves about the future. ""When the Levees Broke"" at the very least is a record on a personal level of what it was like to live through Hurricane Katrina. At best it is a clarion call to hold government accountable for the welfare of its citizens, regardless of color, class or cash flow.",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts
273113,"Up until now, the definitive version of Keaton's 1926 silent masterpiece, ""The General"", has been part of theThe Art of Buster Keaton (The General / Sherlock, Jr. / Our Hospitality / The Navigator / Steamboat Bill Jr. / College / Three Ages / Battling Butler / Go West / The Saphead / Seven Chances / 21 Short Films)DVD set. That release is close to ten years old, which is quite aged in terms of DVD technology. Thus Kino is updating their release of ""The General"" in November. I thought that the version in Art of Buster Keaton was OK, but apparently this version should enable us to see detail we formerly could not.This film flopped when it was released in late 1926 for several reasons. First, its premiere was delayed because ""Flesh and the Devil"" was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks. Second, people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian, not Buster the filmmaker and director, which is more of the role he played here. The film was funny, but it was not gag after gag, like so many of Keaton's other films. Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South. A title card declares he has two loves - his girl and his engine. when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist, but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession. His girlfriend misunderstands, thinks him a coward, and says she won't speak to him again until he is in uniform.Meanwhile, the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Buster's train. Unknown to Buster, his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft. Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train, still without the knowledge of his girl's captivity by the Union army.Forgotten with the arrival of sound, the film revived - often cut up from its original length - in the 1950's because Buster didn't preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain. That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today, often with poor video and hideous musical accompaniment. Kino puts out a quality product, so there should be no such problem in this release.",N/A

I relied on my 23 original home-taped episodes all this time. I'm happy to say, the naysayers are making a big deal over very little.  All the shows are there, just as I remember them, and I remember a lot of them.  I only noticed a few (maybe 6 or so) episodes where music was changed, or the song didn't seem to fit so I assume it was changed.  Of course I cannot remember every single song, but if any others were changed that I didn't perceive, then they chose the replacement music well enough.  Even if more were changed, even a dozen, that's still only 10 percent out of 110 episodes!  Most everything else is there folks, from the Enya music for Chris' Street Sculpture of Lights, to the haunting music for the Maggie and the Bear episode.NOTE: Get the 2 CD's of Music from the show too!!>> One more suggestion: Stop watching after the 'The Mommie's Curse'.The show was over for me at that point in the literal and emotional sense.  I think the writers should have left it there, with the closing of Joel burning his things and going upriver at night.  It would've left things open to possibility, to imagination....*I remember being disappointed that the writers had Joel go back to NYC in the next-and-last 'Joel' episodes, 'The Quest'.  It's The End.After that, something really happened to the show, the acting, even the writing.  The humor was gone, feels like the balloon was popped and fell flat.  The main catalyst had been removed. I didn't like the Capra's, they were blah [Joel was funny] and the townspeople began to seem out-of-character too.Before Joel left, NX used to leave me feeling lighter and refreshed, the knots in my brain were untied and relaxed. But afterward, it became heavy-handed, depressing, even gave me a headache. That's probably why I didn't remember any of those episodes, except for the closing music on the last one. :-\In closing, I recommend any NX fan purchase this collection.  ENJOY!",N/A

162012,"This was a difficult film to review because although it is generally pretty bland there are some aspects I really liked and some I found awful.  Overall I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.Basically, it's a simple action picture about the America's Cup - good solid B-grade material.  The acting is passable, although the actors are weighed down with a terrible script that is full of cliches and stereotypes.  There is no imagination to the characterisation and the film never really engages the viewer.The scenes of sailing are, however, very well filmed and do capture the feeling of yacht racing, and the climax is suitably exciting and satisfying.  Unfortunately the rest of the film is so slow and so full of silly characters and dreadful dialogue that it makes the good bits hardly worth waiting for.But there is one great flaw in this film, and it is unforgivable.  A film such as this can contain fictional characters instead of the actual people who participated in the events, and it can even fictionalise events to a certain degree.  It is essential, however, that major events and characters are not altered because it is these that anchor the film to reality.  Change something important and the film becomes fantasy instead of adventure in an historical setting.For example, suppose the plot of Ron Howard's film ""Apollo XIII"" had the astronauts land on the moon and then the accident that crippled the ship occur on the return leg of the voyage.  The viewer would know that they were no longer watching historical drama, but science fiction instead.Well, that's what ""Wind"" does.  The director never seems to be able to decide whether they were creating a drama about the actual loss and subsequent win of the America's Cup by US teams in the 1980s, or whether they wanted to make a fictional story.For example, in early scenes the US syndicate boss is seen examining and lovingly touching a winged keel on their yacht - implying that it was a US invention.  In reality, it was the winged keel, invented by Australian Ben Lexcen, that was fitted to the Australian challenging yacht and contributed to her capture of the cup.  The America's Cup was also not lost due to a misjudged turn by the defending skipper, as the film implies - it was lost by 5 races to 4 due to the superior skills and technology of the Australian team.  The US boat was simply outraced.Similarly, the cup was won back by the US in the next race, but not by the use of a ""secret weapon"" spinnaker (illegal according to the rules anyway) or an innovative hull design, but simply by good sailing on the part of the US team.  The writers were so concerned with fabricating a love story and creating dramatic situations that they sacrificed the genuine drama and excitement of the race.  They made suspension of disbelief impossible by rewriting historical facts, and that's just plain bad film making.""Wind"" could have been so much more, and in the hands of a good director the flaws in the script could have been reduced, unfortunately Carroll Ballard was not up to the task.  Full marks to the cinematographer, however, for some spectacular shots of yacht racing.",N/A

With this in mind, I realized there would be melodramatic, patriotic and democratic dialogue--and there was almost instantly.  But my difficulty and problems lie mostly with my confusion about what I was supposed to feel.  The message is not clear.  I find this troubling since Hitchcock, being the master, was always able to control his audience without them ever knowing (remember during Psycho, when suddenly the car NOT going into the lake scared you, and you may have noticed later that your allegiance shifted, without a conscious decision, from Marion to Norman?).Regardless of that, Tallulah Bankhead was marvelous, as was Canada Lee (even in his confined role of George ""Joe"" Spencer).Great for WWII propaganda, but a little lacking in the Hitchcock--still a great movie.

1133855,"ONE NIGHT STAND 2008 was another entertaining PPV from the WWE, but I don't think it'll inspire much discussion in the future.  WWE's One Night of Extreme Rules was a most bizarre pleasure:1) Falls Count AnywhereJeff Hardy vs. Umaga---I have to admit I didn't want to see these two square off in the first place.  Not only were my prayers not answered, I got a throwback of the worst kind.  Remember those ""hardcore"" matches from about 1999 or 2000?  You know, where the WWF thought if a match wasn't in the ring, then it must have been ""hardcore""?  I'm afraid this opener was basically these guys just brawling around the arena with little-to-no Extreme moments.  There were a few innovative spots, like when Jeff slid down a stair-railing to deliver a clothesline.  But then the festivities ended with a Swanton Bomb from atop a truck, where we couldn't see the impact.  If you've seen some of Shane McMahon's famous TitanTron falls, where you barely saw where he landed, you know what to expect.  This one didn't even come close to doing the trick for me.""5.0 / 10""---------------------------------------2) Singapore Cane Match - #1 Contender MatchCM Punk vs. John Morrison vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Tommy Dreamer vs. Big Show---Now THIS was more like it!  One of those crazy fights that had some good laughs, and some ""OUCH"" moments too.  Big Show took a nasty cut above his left eye.  San Diego Charger Sean Merriman got to smack Chavo with a cane.  Tommy Dreamer proved he can still hang in an anything-goes environment with the rest of the talent.  Even Mike Adamle got a good chuckle from me: ""Big Show's grabbing canes from that trashcan like Tiger Woods grabs his clubs from his bag!""  That Adamle is starting to grow on me.  I'm not looking forward to Big Show and Kane (ECW champion) having another faceoff, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.  All in all, this was about 12 minutes that would earn the Hammerstein Ballroom's approval.""7.0 / 10""---------------------------------------3) First Blood MatchJBL vs. John Cena---It's official: Cena and Bradshaw had a one-hit wonder 3 years ago, and that's the end of it.  I'm tired of waiting for these two to deliver an excellent brawl again.  Like their JUDGMENT DAY opener --- which I liked a lot more than everybody else --- it wasn't not bad, but not very good either.  Thankfully, we saw a few decent weapons spots and a little back-and-forth fighting; just not a whole lot.  Also, these two beat each other's heads so much, I just started laughing that neither bled for 15 minutes.  It was also funny to hear the crowd cheer JBL for a change.  It's too bad he lost in a rather weak finish.  This rivalry was on the shelf for 3 years; it probably should've stayed there.""6.0 / 10""---------------------------------------4) ""I Quit"" MatchBeth Phoenix vs. Melina---This was more of a Submission Match than an ""I Quit"" Match, but so what?  These ladies engaged in a remarkable technical showdown.  They got about 10 minutes to show off a variety of holds, which was a thrill for the mat-wrestling mark that I am.  The finishing submission looked like one of the most painful holds I've ever seen.  I'm a little disappointed that the crowd didn't get into it more, but maybe that's a reality that won't change.  I think I heard a ""Chyna"" chant going on, which was even weirder.  Anyway, I think the WWE Divas have been steadily improving since October.  Phoenix and Melina gave a good example of why.""7.0 / 10""---------------------------------------5) Stretcher MatchShawn Michaels vs. Batista---First off, I liked how SMACKDOWN got to announce this match, since RAW got to call these two back in April.  Some other good news is that this Stretcher Match was just as good as their BACKLASH encounter.  The first time around was very technical, and this rematch was very similar, just with some Stretchers at ringside.  Batista and Michaels still utilized submission holds, while throwing in some nice Stretcher spots.  The triangle storyline including Chris Jericho got a little weird, when Y2J came out to encourage a weakened Michaels to keep fighting.  The finish was even stranger, with an unexpected nod to the Flair/HBK finale at WRESTLEMANIA 24.  I'll leave that one for you to watch.  I can't tell how I feel about the storyline developments, but if you wanna check out the match on DVD, it'll be worth a watch.""7.0 / 10""---------------------------------------6) Last Man Standing Match - WWE ChampionshipRandy Orton vs. Triple H (champion)---One of the most unpleasant surprises in recent memory.  I've put up with this rivalry going on as long as it has, because the matches between HHH and Orton have usually been worth the PPV airtime.  But this time, it backfired.  About 10 minutes in, Orton was tossed over the top rope, and landed so awkwardly that he hurt his collarbone.  The action before this finish was decent, but Orton's injury (which seemed to be very real) apparently ended things prematurely.  Like the Montreal Screwjob, the finish was so shocking I won't remember the rest if it.""5.5 / 10""---------------------------------------7) TLC Match - World Heavyweight Championship (vacant)Edge vs. The Undertaker (Banished From WWE If Defeated)---How do these two men keep doing it?  This was the only reason I needed to order this PPV in the first place, because of these guys' outstanding encounters.  But time after time, Edge and Undertaker have put on a Match-of-the-Year candidate.  This rivalry is the stuff of classics, folks.  So how's the match?  In short, it was outstanding, and both men did nothing but improve their reputation as WWE legends.  Taker and Edge deserve a ton of credit for going through with this spot-fest, considering they're both kinda injury-prone.  I enjoy TLC for the carnage; besides Taker and Edge spent 3 months delivering sensible displays of in-ring psychology.  When it comes to TLC Matches, I don't expect logical competition.  That does bring up one big complaint from me, however.  The final high-risk spot, while more daring than anything I'd ever attempt, was beyond predictable.  Other than that, this main event did the TLC lineage proud.One last note - big props to WWE for treating Taker's loss with class and respect.  This match only had 2 weeks of build-up, so I didn't think this would be his last match.  I know you it's never-say-never in wrestling, but Taker's departure felt just as real as Austin's ""retirement"" from 5 years ago.  If this is a storyline, WWE played it very well.  But if this is the last time Undertaker graces a WWE presentation, it's a hell of a way to go out!""8.0 / 10""---------------------------------------________________________________________________CLOSING THOUGHTS---ONE NIGHT STAND 2008 has put me in a puzzling state of speculation.  This 2008 edition was a genuine rollercoaster.  It started slow, gained speed, hit a roadblock, and ended with the ultimate adrenaline rush.  My only real gripe is that nothing really seems resolved from tonight's PPV.  Orton's injury and Taker's banishment (real or fake) have abruptly taken them out of the big picture, which means HHH and Edge have no momentum as champions.  The HBK/Jericho/Batista triangle is far from over, so tonight was a mid-novel chapter.  Big Show is the #1 Contender foe the ECW Title, but I doubt anybody is looking forward to that.  And the rest of the card, while entertaining in patches, isn't anything to go out of your way to see.Is this ONE NIGHT STAND better than last year's garbage?  Absolutely!  Is it better than the 2005 & 2006 ECW events?  Not even close.  I don't know if this PPV will age well.  Like I said, it was a rollercoaster - entertaining while it lasted, but won't be the same the next time around.",WWE One Night Stand 2008
623612,"I like to feel that I am balanced in my scorn of cod-science. For some reason, some people have taken offence to my review of ""State of Fear"", the Michael Crichton stinker. Ok, TDAT takes some pretty sound scientific principles and drives a bus through them to get a plot out of it. Lets be fair, no one is going to say ""oh My God, I`m going to be crushed by that rapidly advancing glacier if I stay routed to this spot for the next couple of thousand years"", so I can allow them their scientific whimsies for dramatic purposes. But I was able to ignore the science (and as an environmental scientist who does this stuff every day, if I can do it, so can you) enough to enjoy the film for what it is, an Independence Day type of disaster movie, and to be fair, probably more plausible than being invaded by aliens (which is kind of disappointing as I recently enjoyed a screening of ""V-The Mini-series"" on Sci-Fi Channel recently).On the science front, I would place it as equivalent to cloning dinosaurs from extinct DNA, sounds sorta pseudo science possible, but actually we are unlikely to be over-run by velociraptors on our way to do the Christmas shopping next year. And if you are, like TDAT's tidal waves, a simple revolving door should keep you safe.One thing I hope isn't true is that the makers of the film were asked to speak to Congressional Hearings on Climate Change. I don't think the film sets out to be ""An Inconvenient Truth"" with special effects, just a popcorn enhancing flick.  I like to think of it as more ""a convenient half truth"".(PS - If someone else has used that, sorry, I didn't read all 700 reviews.)",The Day After Tomorrow

1114417,"Not quite what I would have expected (based on trailers in advertisements), but not bad.  Given the leads, and backgrounds of same, I expected something more along the lines of say American Pie or Wedding Crashers, but this was rather tame.  Note that says tame, not lame.  Released straight to video, rather than going to theatres, one might think the movie here isn't worth the time, but that isn't true.  Perhaps somewhat in line with the American Pie 'wedding movie', this one is certainly formulaic but delivers a cute movie if you care to sit and watch it.Anderson (Jason Biggs) has his anticipated fiance unexpectedly become, well, unavailable.  Heartbroken, not ready to move on, despite his best friend telling him that his relationship wasn't ready to move on to the next level begin with, he's somewhat dared into striking up a new relationship.  One that by chances happens to involve Kate (Wedding Crasher's crazy red head Isla Fisher).  So starts a rushed romantic relationship as the two characters propose to each other, accept the proposals and then question whether or not their relationship is a a good or bad thing.  Can they actually make it through to getting married, or will the baggage each carries ruin things before they can even get started?The comedy isn't quite as low-brow (for the most part) as any of the American Pie movies, or say Saving Silverman (another Biggs starring role) would be, but there are some funny scenes stolen by Anderson's parents and Katie's as well.Coarse language at times, sexual content/suggestive behavior, probably deserved of the R rating that is carried for this one.

24334,"What can I tell you about ""Seven Samurai"" that you haven't already heard? I was thinking recently about why it is that, although the dialogue in the film mostly functions to advance the plot, and the later scenes are mostly devoted to the mechanics of battle, nonetheless every one of the characters is vibrant and alive, and instantly wins one's trust and sympathy. The answer, I think, lies in gestures and facial expressions. The faces of the samurai embody distinct and memorable character types, and their mannerisms, rather than their words, serve to bring out details of their personality.Katsushiro, the young samurai, has few if any ""introspective"" lines, but he's the most expressive depiction of the ""naive youth"" archetype that I have ever seen, in any film. The performance captures countless lifelike details -- like how he doesn't know what to do when Shino comes on to him, and how later he stands around looking shell-shocked. Or, for instance, how, when he sees Kikuchiyo brooding outside, he runs up to him with a boyish smile, evidently used to viewing Kikuchiyo as the jester of the group, and then suddenly looks bewildered when he sees that Kikuchiyo is not in the best of moods. Or his embarrassment when he throws the coins at Yohei and Rikichi in the inn and sees their obeisance. Or his amazement when he finally kills a bandit in battle, or his explosion of grief at the battle's end.Kikuchiyo, too, is always interesting to watch. I don't have to point out his passionate nature, but it's interesting how the film puts in little details that set him apart from the samurai. The scene where he unsuccessfully tries to ride Yohei's horse is very funny, but it also underscores the fact that the other samurai have been trained to ride from birth, and Kikuchiyo's most valiant efforts just aren't enough to bridge the gulf between them. He frequently misinterprets ""what it means to be a samurai,"" and can't understand what exactly he's missing. He tops Kyuzo's feat by stealing one of the bandits' guns and then fearlessly taunting them, and is surprised when Kambei scolds him. The distinction, of course, is that Kyuzo performed heroic deeds during his free time, whereas Kikuchiyo abandoned his post, but the latter doesn't get it.Kyuzo himself is an iconic figure. The best scene in the entire film (I have seen it cause a standing ovation in a theatre) is when he returns in the morning with the stolen gun and modestly sits down to sleep. Katsushiro praises him to the skies, and after he prances away, there is a remarkable expression on Kyuzo's face, a bit flattered and embarrassed, and also empathetic to Katsushiro's youth. And Kyuzo's absolutely detached calm, as he sits by a tree and picks flowers while he waits for the bandits to arrive, is another timeless image.Then there's Gorobei, who has almost no lines at all, but who instantly wins one over with his good-natured grin. He's the guy who immediately sees through Kambei's ""trap"" in the inn, and calls from outside, ""Please, no jokes!"" He is rarely in the spotlight, but he seems to be closer to Kambei in character than the others. And it's funny that he's so easily amused by Heihachi -- the way he cracks up at the latter's jokes is funnier than the jokes themselves.Kambei, as the leader who holds the group together and never loses his cool, and also has most of the ""meaningful"" lines, has probably been extensively analyzed already. But aside from his personal appeal, his methodical approach to strategy is captivating, because each of his moves looks so logical and well-thought-out, like something one ought to do in that situation, not at all like a mere plot point. One of the best conversations occurs when he asks Gorobei, ""How would you attack this village?"" A professional approach, forsooth.The film's power of suggestion extends to the setting itself. Kurosawa firmly insists on the distance between samurai and peasants. In the final scene with Shino, Rikichi's statements about the power of love fall on deaf ears, as they should. The villagers turn and leave, and Kambei decides not to intervene. This resolution, gloomy mainly due to the sense of inevitability that it creates, is admirably true to life. Also notable, and very understated, is the fact that all casualties among the samurai are due to guns. Perhaps this is a subtle way of suggesting that their era is already almost over, and even the utmost skill won't help them in modern war.Everyone has already commented on the visual aspects of the film, but the imagery is unforgettable. There's a horrifying image early on when the farmers' rice is stolen in the inn, and Yohei tries to pick up fallen grains one by one. And the most indelible sight is that of the chaotic, vicious final battle in the rain and mud. Kambei's meticulous planning, after holding out for so long, finally gives way to a total mess, a jumble of horses and people in which the samurai accomplish amazing martial feats in every shot, but the shots move so quickly that one doesn't have time to appreciate them.This is one of the few truly flawless films in existence. It is three and a half hours long, but the length is hardly noticeable. The battles are gripping. But aside from the masterful choreography and technical innovation, the characters just come to life so vividly! It's difficult to name another film where such thorough characterization would be implied through such indirect means. It belongs in any film collection.",N/A

1144274,"Mike Nichols' ""Charlie Wilson's War"" features real-life characters and events that seem stranger than the wildest fiction. But that's Washington, D.C., for you. In a way, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" could almost be considered an American ""Schindler's List,"" recast as a drawing-room (or smoke-filled back room) comedy. Tom Hanks' Wilson, like Oscar Schindler, is a high-living wheeler-dealer; at the beginning of Aaron Sorkin's sharply witty screenplay, he uses his office as U.S. Representative for the Second Congressional District of Texas as an excuse to re-enact ""Boogie Nights."" But Wilson, like Schindler, also has a social conscience, and soon it is raised in the cause of the oppressed Afghan people fighting a losing battle against Soviet occupation. Before long, Wilson is using his considerable backroom negotiating skills to ensure the Afghans are fighting a winning battle. Wilson is aided and abetted in particular by two people just as unlikely as he: Jo Anne Herring (Julia Roberts), a wealthy right-wing Christian activist who doesn't let her beliefs curtail her enthusiasm for double martinis and consorting (socially and otherwise) with liberal Democrats like Wilson, and Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a schlubby, tart-tongued, but brilliant CIA operative who isn't averse to smashing a few plate-glass windows to get people's attention. Nichols and Sorkin take us on a breathless tour of Washington, Texas, Las Vegas and a large swath of the Middle East, giving us an intimate view of precisely how politics and diplomacy work. (Amazing how much can get done, just by having a belly dancer handy when you need one!) ""Charlie Wilson's War"" deserves to be ranked with such classics as ""Advise and Consent"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" as one of the best movies ever made about Washington.",N/A

1214036,"It's become a tradition for me to see each Saw movie in the theater since 2004. I've always liked horror movies and this is one of the only horror franchises that I've made the effort to see in the theater on opening night.The theater was packed with people, even though it was a midnight showing.As I watched the events of Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) and Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and the ruthless Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) unfolding in front of me, I realized that the Saw franchise had turned a corner, and not in a positive direction.This movie wasn't great, and it wasn't terrible, but just about every plot device was already used in Saw II. The quick MTV-style scene cuts are here, the gory and marvelously inventive traps are here, and if that's what you want to see, you won't be disappointed.The ""Twist"" ending, however, is fairly predictable, especially to anyone who has already seen the previous Saw movies.As the theater patrons left, everyone was saying pretty much the same thing - discussing traps, the amount of blood & gore, etc. However, one person said ""It didn't feel new.""This movie reminded me of my 16 year old dog - he had vision problems, his hind legs didn't work well, and even though all the signs of old age were there, I still loved him, right up to the end.If you're a die-hard Saw fan, you'll probably see it in the theater like I did...but you might find yourself wondering how much life the franchise has left in it.",N/A

1178726,"If you were like most who enjoy horror movies, you probably looked forward to The Strangers like a kid on Christmas day, running down to a living room filled with brightly wrapped presents and a dazzilingly lit tree. What you probably didn't expect when you opened your expensive looking box was a handful of gravel and the smell of cat urine. That pretty well describes the disappointment that you'll feel with The Strangers, one of the greatest previews ever made.The premise is straightforward. A couple recently returned from a wedding, and reeling from a refusal of marriage, stops at a remote house for the night. What was supposed to be sunshine and romance is instead an awkward and drawn out shuffle of two people who can barely stand to look at one another. Then a knock at the door, a woman looking for her friend Tamara, which sets off a series of startle scares and repititous spooky scenes, as the couple are set upon by three masked assailants.The let downs begin with the characters themselves, who apparently barely made it out of the 3rd grade. While many people bemoan the stupidity of characters in slashers, these two hopeless souls and their erstwhile allies are so mind boggingly inept that its a wonder the villians don't leave them in peace. Hunters want prey, and tormenting Tyler and Speedman was about as challenging as kicking a pair of still blind puppies.The set is spooky, though lighting and setup make for some poorly shot scenes. Overall, it was a great design for a slasher pic, though it was poorly handled. The sound and dialogue are okay, and the costumes for the villians are definitely unsettling given their relative passivity. You don't expect Pikachu or Hello Kitty to try and drive a knife into your guts.The story line is rather fast paced, and there are some very spooky moments, the majority of which you saw in the trailer, but expectations were far higher for this piece, and it ends up being a remake of Friday the 13th, an empty slasher following people with more alcohol in their system than brains, with a disappointing, predictable ending and a hollow message of evil wearing many faces.",N/A

877043,"I had heard bits and pieces about this anime since I started collecting cels. I always recognized them because they are probably some of the most expensive anime cels out there. Even so I had never seen the anime, but I heard from many others that it was a great timeless anime. Now I don't have a specific genre of anime I like, just whatever happens to come my way, which seems to be giant robot ones and sci fi ness. So I took a chance when Best Buy put the series set on sale and bought it. It actually sat on my shelf for several months until recently.Spoilers may be below.The anime is about a boy named Shinji who is selected as the third child to pilot the Evangelion(robot) 001. He is pretty depressed about it but pilots it anyway. He and 2 other pilots Rei and Asuka all fight these monsters called Angels. During the anime Shinji goes through a great deal of stress and emotion wondering why he is here and what his lifes meaning is. Despite being an action packed series it is very psycological. The series ends abruptly with Shinji's mind wandering in itself.I have to say I was never expecting to enjoy this anime as much as I did. It really was brilliantly done in almost all aspects of it. The music was enjoyable and the characters were very human. Shinji the main character is very depressing, but in that aspect of him it seems how a real person would be acting. Even though the robots or Eva's as they're referred to are a big part of the story they don't overshadow the human characters. The only thing I really had a problem with was the ending of the anime. The last 2 episodes got really confusing to the point where I had no idea what was going on. Lots of still images and flashing. I was really happy to see the ending much better explained in the Evangelion movie End of Evangelion.The dvds in this set are in slim cases which I am not a fan of.

In art not Story!My two favorite parts was the first one because it was similar to an episode of batman the animated series: you know the one with the kids and their stories and there perceptions of batman. It takes you back but unlike that batman from what seemed like so long ago, the violence has been amped up! And the last one with Deathshot I never liked him because I always thought of him as the ""poor man's Bullseye!""Another incredible thing is they got the voice of Kevin Conroy which is the Batman from the animated series. In my mind and heart the only real Batman.Man this really deserves ten stars not five. See the animated version of Batman has always been better then the live action stuff. Because one: a real grown man dressed in a batsuit is ridiculus and animated grown man somehow looks natural and two: You can do stuff that you can't do in live action. As the six and final part proves! Actually there are a few things that can only be done by animation throughout the whole movie but then again six is my favorite.Now if they could only do this with Superman. Adam Baldwin as Superman, I kept expecting Superman to rob a bank and side with the bad guy. Shouldn't typecast but he was really good as Jane. Just as Kevin is really good as Batman!!",N/A

Obviously one cannot help but feel a certain tension between the Egyptians and Israelis, although there is no mention of this in the film at all.I am sure that a message is in there somewhere, but it is difficult to decipher it.

It's not tongue-in-cheek enough to be campy, and it's not subtle enough to be satire. It was impossible for me to suspend my disbelief and swallow the idea that this was happening in a far future devastated by nuclear warfare. I expected that at any given moment the camera would turn and reveal the entire film crew, complete with the director wearing a hawaiian shirt, sitting in his chair under a beach umbrella, and sipping a fancy cocktail. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The beginning animations were interesting enough, but after about 20 minutes it disintegrated towards total boredom. I couldn't last past 45 minutes.

1148184,When I saw they would be remaking my favorite J-Horror movie in the US I was excited but nervous. Apparently I was right to be so!...it sucked it didn't even end right....they completely screwed that part up!.....Of course I don't know what I expected when they couldn't even get the ring tone right. The original was much better in terms of acting (although I will say the mane female lead did well) and they didn't have the cheap Hollywood scares that the US versions of movies seem so intent on using.....it was just a really great psychological horror movie...that gave you a lot more to think about at the end than its American counter part....my opinion see the original and forget this crappy remake was ever done!,N/A

1127020,"Awake, the new thriller by first-time director Joby Harold, takes off from a grisly real-life phenomenon called ""anesthetic awareness."" This is when patients are unaccountably left fully conscious--and physically paralyzed--during surgery, and Harold (who also wrote the script) has spun a preposterously entertaining yarn from this grisly germ of an idea, and manages to hold us in a vice-like grip for pretty much the entire film. How often can you say of a Hollywood thriller that you don't have a clue what's going to happen next? Awake is brazenly indifferent to plausibility, but you can't help but admire the film's audacity. Along with fantastic plot twists, Harold throws Hitchcockian flourishes and elements of Greek tragedy into the mix like a crazed chef. In lesser hands, Awake would have been a tawdry melodrama, but Harold believes in his material so fervently (in a way a more seasoned professional never could) that the film works on several levels at once. Ingenious as it is, it's not mechanical--it has soul.Harold brings such energy and focus to the scenes that he transcends the subject matter and gives it an almost surreal intensity, and the performances are strong enough to keep the film's nuttiness from capsizing it. Jessica Alba is suitably luscious and beguiling (her role gives new meaning to the term ""heartbreaker""), and Lena Olin and Terence Howard are both in fine form. As the unfortunate victim of anesthetic awareness, Hayden Christensen comes into his own as a performer (having mercifully managed to escape the Mark Hammil curse: that of being horribly miscast by George Lucas). Christensen has an unusually expressive face (the camera takes to him), and he can convey emotion without ever appearing to do much--fortunately, because the film hinges around his internal struggle, and on our feelings of empathy for him.Awake is a white-knuckle movie experience if ever there was one (it even carries a viewer warning), with some of the most sheerly visceral scenes of horror ever committed to celluloid. Watching someone undergoing open-heart surgery while fully conscious (and able to feel the incision) is enough to frazzle the nerves of the most hardened horror veterans, and this film is certainly not for the squeamish. Too bad the loopy plot (and the melodramatic character revelations, which are really just tired genre conventions) finally stretches our credibility to breaking point. As a result, Awake lacks a strong climax, and as a rollercoaster ride it doesn't have enough emotional depth to be fully satisfying (its shallowness is at odds with its rather contrived attempts at pathos). But for most of its length it's close to a pop classic, and probably the best metaphysical thriller since The Sixth Sense (a film I didn't much care for). In fact, Harold better watch out or he may wind up as the next M. Night Shyamalan. Awake has so many twists it makes you dizzy.",N/A

1173649,"As the latest offering from the prolific Judd Apatow stable, this meandering but amusing 2008 comedy probably had one of the most irritating advertising campaigns ever for a wide release movie as cryptic billboards were posted everywhere with nasty diatribes written to the title character. Having enjoyed Apatow'sThe 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Upa lot, I am starting to realize there is a bit more of a potluck feel when Apatow isn't in the director's chair. This time, first-time director Nicholas Stoller is at the helm working from a script written by the film's star, Jason Segel. Granted the comic premise is not as fresh here as in the earlier films, but it is entertaining in a ramshackle sort of way with some moments of surprising nuance. Segel plays Peter Bretter, a typical nice-guy type who writes the music (or more accurately, the sonic tones) of a network TV series that looks very much likeC.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation. The show stars his hot-babe girlfriend Sarah, and they've been together for five years, an eternity at least by Hollywood standards.The film wastes no time in setting up the central problem - Sarah abruptly dumps Peter for Brit rock star Aldous Snow, and through the plot's key contrivance, the three of them end up in the same resort in Hawaii. Naturally, Peter is devastated by the break-up, especially when he has to watch Sarah and Aldous in post-coital euphoria in a tropical honeymoon setting. Peter does find solace in the shapely form and understanding heart of Rachel Jansen, the hotel's front desk manager. All of this is fairly by-the-numbers and reminds me of the tropical shenanigans in the inferior remake ofThe Heartbreak Kid, except Segel as a writer makes all the characters likable to varying degrees. Aldous, as played dexterously by comedian Russell Brand, is a hilarious comic creation, a sexed-up, non-sequitur-spouting cast-off from Spinal Tap. Even Sarah comes across less as a vicious harpy and more as someone who felt she tried to salvage the relationship (although interpersonal communication must not be one of her strong suits).As Peter, Segel has a doughy, affable appeal though not particularly arresting for a main character. When he's not being teary-eyed over Sarah or just plain naked, he has a tendency to throw away lines in a casual manner rather than deliver them. Saddled with the toughest part, Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) acquits herself well enough as Sarah to make her character's fate more of a concern than one would expect. Late ofThat '70s Show, the saucy Mila Kunis provides a down-to-earth sexiness to Rachel. Of course, several members of the Apatow repertory company are present and accounted for - Bill Hader as Peter's sarcastic brother, Jonah Hill as a waiter with a severe man-crush on Aldous (perhaps a tweak to his role inSuperbad), and Paul Rudd as a stoned surfing instructor (Seth Rogen is conspicuously absent). Funny bits are also provided by Jack McBrayer (Kenneth on30 Rock) as a petrified honeymooner and comic Steve Landesberg as a helpful pediatrician. As usual for an Apatow movie, the movie goes on for too long, and the scenes with the competing couples, while funny, play on the predictable side, as does the inevitable ending. It's all funny enough but just not as focused as I wish it could have been.",N/A
1072743,"What a breath of fresh air this film was to watch!.....or should I say a breath of good old fashioned ""Universal"" chills? I finally watched this movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of creepy atmosphere it had. The dolls in this movie are freaky looking and I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up more than once while watching this classic style fright flick.This is a ""ghost story"" in every sense of the words and ventriloquist dolls are very, very scary! There are some clever plot twist and excellent camera work in this spooky thrill ride that plays like your riding through an old creepy dark ride at an amusement park or carnival. I also found that the use of 'silence'(""Dead Silence"")when things are about to go wrong, was ingenious and it worked like the music in 'Jaws' did, whenever it went silent you knew something bad was going to happen! This is one of the cleverest horror movies I've seen in a while and it has little or no gore.The unrated version has a little more visual blood(very little)and also a plot point which helps to make the story make more sense.

1140023,"The tone of this anime reminded me of Ghost in the Shell (either the movie or series). As is common in anime, the film has an opening dialog to explain something of where we are in the world.  Japan is the industry leader in robotics and produces cutting-edge technology, but the world has an adverse reaction to their development of cyborg technology.  The want to make human-looking androids.  The UN (in all its power) rules that the production of Androids is illegal, so Japan throws a tantrum and locks themselves in their room.  Literally.  They use special emitters to diffuse all communication and even visible light that passes the borders. Foreigners were deported and a network created to blocks satellites from looking in.  This same network alerts Japanese officials if any traffic tries to enter the country from sea or air without going through the one and only gate they've set-up for imports.  When the movie begins, the rest of the world has not ""seen"" the face of Japan in over ten years.The film opens with a bang. A government agency (SWORD) is swooping in on a mansion where a big wig from Daiwa Robotics is meeting with US Officials supposedly to get them to back android production. During the raid, one of the SWORD agents gets hold of the Daiwa man as he's picked up by a plane crashing through the building. They are both dangling from this plane when the man brings out a long knife and completely cuts off the leg the SWORD agent is holding onto. She falls to the ground but takes the leg back with her, where it is analyzed. During the tests, scientists find out that the leg is synthetic and made of a kind of bio-metal. This leads to speculation as to whether the man has other robotic limbs, and if the bio-signature they picked up when the scanned the mansion was even real.  More stories unfold about androids appearing in America, until finally SWORD decides to sneak into Japan. They send a squad through the border to set up a device that will allow them to break through the network.  What they learn is surprising and horrible.Thought the first scene was exciting, the pace of the film is actually a bit slow. More importantly, it could be very confusing even if a viewer is paying close attention.  I was frustrated at times wondering what was going on, but when I got to the end and ""all was revealed,"" I thought the plot was pretty awesome and unique.  The artwork was very good. The characters seem to be rendered using cell-shading, whereas robots and scenery are either hand-drawn or computer-rendered. At times this did bother me.  Doing two very different styles made the movie look pieced together. Like when someone doctors a photo so the person is obviously not part of the background. Character development is a little strange, but I believe rightly so - there is a scene where the main character and a team member are gazing out over the city they live in and complaining that with the millions of people that live there, they hardly ever see or talk to anyone else as a result of the age they live in. I feel that the slower character development in the movie is an accurate reflection of living in this kind of society, as opposed to some flaw in the movie itself.  This may have been what contributed to the ""what is going on"" feeling I had at times.  This is not unlike how many people felt at the beginning of ""The Matrix.""  And that turned out to be fantastic.  The music was excellent and perfect for this type of film.Overall, this was enjoyable and I'll watch it again to pick up some of what I missed in the first viewing.

victim in this one.The leader of the Karis sect(John Carradine) seeks the  spirit of the princess who this time seems to have inhabited another young girl in the town.He works out of a local cave/mine and eventually the killings in the town arouse the suspicions of everyone.The girl in question often talks strangely and has been found lying  on the ground close to where the Mummy travels and kills.Finally she is captured by Karis and the chase is on.But this time the Mummy actually escapes carrying his ""love"" into a local swamp and the pair disappear into the quagmire never to be seen again.Finally in the last installment ""The Mummy's Curse""(1944) we find the owner of a construction company contracted to drain the very swamp the Mummy and his princess disappeared into some time before.The workers he has hired are of course jumpy and leary of the entire area to begin with with talks of curses and strange goings on.Unknowingly during their work they release the Mummy who is found by the co-hort of an archeologist sent to the swamp to investigate the mummy story.His cohort however has sinister plans and is really there to take the Mummy and the princess(if found) back to Egypt where they belong.They hold up in the ruins of an old monastery and do their works from that location.Around this time the woman in whose body the princess' spirit resides(from the last picture)also is inadvertantly uncovered and also comes to life.She is confused and dazed and is found by one of the local residents.But Karis finds her and kills everyone who would get in his way to keep her.The townspeople of course spring into action,again out for a piece of the mummys' hide.The chase leads to the old ruins where in the end the Mummy seemingly gets killed under the falling fragments of a corner of the monastery.As the series progressed the films got slightly weaker with each successive one and the plot threads that bound each to the other got thinner also.But they were all solid money makers for the studios(some more so than others) and they all hold up pretty well today.All films have been wonderfully restored.There is a documentary called""Mummy Dearest:A Horror Tradition Unearthed"",there is film commentary for the original movie provided by film historian Paul Jensen,the ""Mummy Archives"" and all the original theatrical trailers are included.All considering this set is a must have for all true horror fans.This Legacy collection gives us all a chance to see these films in a wonderfully restored and pristine condition as never before.They have been out for about four years now so before they disappear altogether may I suggest,if you haven't already,start your collection of this must have classic collection today.",N/A
574052,"It's all to easy to understand why Lamberto Bava's solo directorial debut Macabre failed to find much of an audience back in 1980: it feels more like a pitch than a fully fleshed out story, and one that's overly reliant on a shock ending that's pretty obvious. At times it feels like two separate underdeveloped films almost in competition with each other. Unfortunately the most interesting, a bad seed plot with the anti-heroine's homicidal daughter taking revenge on her for her infidelity by killing her young brother and trying to drive mommy back into the asylum, gets the least screen time in favor of mom not letting a little thing like decapitation stand between her and her dead lover. Much of it feels padded out and repetitive and unfortunately leading lady Bernice Stegers, admittedly hampered by a presumably dubbed deep fried Sowthan aksunt, simply cannot carry the film. Too well made to be unintentionally funny (at least until the absurd final shot), too boring to hold the attention and too predictable to offer any suspense, it's not difficult to see why this was such a flop that Bava didn't direct another film for three years.Lamberto Bava's second film, A Blade in the Dark, is a slightly above average late giallo despite some incredibly some heavy-handed clues (a female director who dresses in men's suits, an actress appearing in a play about Vita Sackville-West, a flamboyantly gay assistant and an opening scene where two children taunt another for being a female - gee, do you think they're trying to tell us something about the killer?). Somewhat surprisingly originally intended for television but turned down for excessive violence, it mostly makes a virtue of its low budget though isn't able to make much of its key location, a large but rather characterless and unmenacing villa that conveniently belonged to the film's producer. Still, any film that has a director being killed by her own film has something going for it.",N/A

437088,"Summerslam 1998 was the Highway to Hell for Stone Cold and the Undertaker for the WWE title. This rivalry was building up for months and this match finally took place right here in the Garden. Another big time match that took place here was the epic ladder match between Triple h and The Rock. This Summerslam was probably the most hyped one up to this point in time.1. European TitleVal Venis vs. D'Lo BrownThis match was a very good opener. These two had a pretty good match up. D'Lo at this time was wearing his phony chest protector which came into play many times. A good match which ended in a dq but it did had some good reversals and moves used. 3.5/52. Kaientai vs. The OdditiesNothing really great or exciting at all but some good quality entertainment. It was fun to watch the little guys from Kaientai fight the bigger and taller guys from the Oddities. Nothing great by any means but very entertaining and fun. 2/53. Hair Match- Jeff Jarrett vs. X-PacA pretty refreshing match, least from a wrestling stand point. These two was pretty much on point in this match and pulling off good counters and getting in some shots on each other. They have had better but this is a match that belongs here. Good match up. 3.75/54. Edge & Sable vs. Marc Mero & JacquelineI believe this was edges's ppv debut. Edge was very on key here and showing everyone what he is made of. He pulled off an impressive dive over the top rope onto mero. Sable and Edge was working very well together and doing double teamed moves. A good ppv debut for Edge. 3.5/55. Lion's Den Match- Owen Hart vs. Ken ShamrockA very unique match here. They were placed in this circle ring with no ropes surrounded by like a 12 ft high cage. Hart and Shamrock were going for submissions all through the match. Hart took a few hard shots from Shamrock here. I felt this match could have been better with what both of these guys are capable of but they still gave us something good to watch. 3.5/56. Tag Team TitlesNo Holds Barred & Pin Falls Count AnywhereMankind vs. New Age OutlawsIt was supposed to be Mankind & Kane but Kane didn't show up. Mankind was at his usual routine here taking his hard chair shots to the head and the hard slams onto the floor. Mankind really takes a beating, getting in very little offense here and there. Nothing we haven't already seen from Foley before. Kane does make an appearence after the match anyhow. 4/56. Intercontinental TitleLadder Match- The Rock vs. Triple HThis is another match that had a lot of build up to. After their match atWWE In Your House 23 - Fully Loadedsolved nothing, Rock and Triple H upped their game here in this tremendous ladder match to end their feud. Both Hunter and Rock took a lot of hard punishment from the ladder and from each other. A lot of the action takes place on the outside where both took some viscious bumps on the ladder. Rock trys to work on Hunter's knee here and there. The fans was very electric in this one. The action in the ring was also very good. This was great match which stole the show. Outstanding match. This match is also available onWWE - The Ladder Match. A showstopping match. 5/57. WWE TitleUndertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve AustinA perfect main event to close out the show. This match had a lot of hype behind it and Austin & Taker left it all on the line in this one. Taker was really out brawling Austin here and giving strikes after strikes and just using his strength to wear down Stone Cold. Austin was able to produce and pull out moveneuvers Austin rarely uses to counter and try to beat down Taker. The action would get taken to the outside where Taker would drop a massive leg drop to Austin while on the announce table. A pretty good counter from Austin into the stunner for the finish. A great main event. 5/5This is one I recommend basically for the last two matches. But don't spend too much on it though.",WWF: SummerSlam 1998 - Highway To Hell VHS
1101273,"Let me start by saying that I have never gotten into shows like Seinfeld, Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, etc.  It is a real departure for me to even watch a show like this, much less to like it on the level that I like KoQ.Yes, it is a great ensemble cast, but I think that Kevin James is the one that holds it all together.  (Gary Valentine (Danny) is his real brother.)I have seen the same episodes on cable again and again and this show has yet to lose its appeal for me.  Somehow you feel like you are right in the Heffernan living room, and although you might not want to live there, it's an awfully fun place to visit.I watched Hitch strictly on account of Kevin James.  He probably has some sort of a future in feature films, but I hope he creates another episodic niche such as KoQ.

1125554,"Jodie Foster continues to illustrate how gifted she is as an actor! In The Brave One, her portrayal of Erica Bain is perfectly drawn with neither too much nor too little given to the character. There is a controlled pitch in her movements and in her voice which so graphically communicates her need to hide from the rest of the world. After she and her fiance (Naveen Andrews) are severely beaten during a walk in Central Park, she is told that he has died. The memorial services took place while she remained in a coma so there was no opportunity for closure. The balance of the movie gives the viewer a close look at her recovery, both physical and emotional. An extraordinary relationship develops between Erica and a detective(Det. Mercer played by Terrence Howard) who is investigating a spate of killings in the city. It turns out that he is a closeted fan of Erica's radio program which offers a darker, edgier perspective on the city (""the safest big city""). There is a feeling of familiarity he experiences as a result of having been an avid listener to her program. Both he and Erica find in each other, that one person in whom to confide with an honesty usually reserved for more intimate relationships. As the story progresses, the relationship between Erica and Det. Mercer becomes key as her interest in his work on the aforementioned killings begin to catch her interest both personally and professionally.Within the context of such a strong story told so well, Terrence Howard and Jodie Foster are particularly adept at drawing our emotions out. There is an emotional investment that the viewer feels in both characters  and you end up caring about what happens to both. The details with which director Neil Jordan concerns himself make the difference between great and good! Loose ends are tied up in their due time. The viewer never feels cheated.I watch a lot of movies and unfortunately there are a lot of mediocre efforts out there. I am moved to write this review because The Brave One stands out in my mind, as one of the better efforts of 2008 thus far. It will have you thinking about it long after the closing credits are rolled.",N/A

643470,"Lucky Number Slevin is a stylish little brain bender of a movie. It's fun, smart, and slick, full of clever plot twists and funhouse mirror dynamics. The plot takes a well-known clich&eacute; (mistaken identity) and inverts it, turning audience expectations inside out with a few narrative flicks of the wrist.  It's a crime flick with a penchant for sharp, off kilter dialogue, stylistic left turns, and dark humor. The characters, despite their unsavory professions, are memorable and likeable. And since people's exact motivations are difficult to suss out (until the end, anyway), you never really know which ones are bad guys and which ones are good guys, so you get to root for `em all. The story sinks its hooks into the viewer from the credits sequence, tightening its grip with a beguiling (and heartbreaking) exposition, and refusing to let go until the very end.And then there's the cast: Morgan Freeman and (Sir) Ben Kingsley as two warring crime bosses, Bruce Willis as a wily, sinister, and charismatic assassin, Josh Hartnett (he's really good in this one) as the instantly endearing wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time protagonist, and Lucy Liu (she's awesome in this one) as his bubbly love interest. Now that, my friends, is a dream team! I won't go too far into each individual player's virtues, but suffice to say that each one is absolutely perfect for his or her respective role.Most telling is the fact that despite its ludicrously high body count (you'd have better odds of living through a James Bond movie climax as a jumpsuited henchman), Lucky Number Slevin is still a feel-good movie. You can't help but smile at its climactic scenes and wrenching twists. Even its stylish meta-cinematic references to classic mistaken identity and action films come off as smart and good-natured rather than snobby or pretentious.All of which to say, it'd be incredibly easy to compare Lucky Number Slevin to a Tarantino film. It wouldn't be off the mark, either.",Lucky Number Slevin
427333,"Directed by Ridley Scott's brother, Tony Scott, this 1980s horror vampire film is not a typical vampire movie and yet at the same time is not even a typical motion picture. There is no mistaking though that The Hunger does look great and the lighting camera combination is very gothic urban.The story strands involve two vampires played by David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve, who kill people to drink their blood so they can have extended life. However these vampires are not the traditional type. They do not have fangs and they can go out in sunlight. Susan Sarandon plays a scientist who thinks that aging is a disease and can be cured. She is sought after by Catherine Deneuve.The film is notorious for the lesbian scene between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. There are also impressive special effects for Bowie's aging process. He grows old over the course of a number of scenes. Apart from this however the film seems to loose touch with the subject matter, freely roaming towards art for art's sake and sacrifices the story so severely that the ending doesn't make any sense because of it.If you are a fan of Tony Scott, David Bowie, Catherine Deneuve or 80s horror films then it might be worth checking out. Vampire movie fans may want to reconsider and even vampire film completers may hold back.",N/A
1221397,"I'm excited that South Park is now available on Blu-Ray and hope other animated shows will soon be doing the same. I was in fourth grade when South Park came out back in 1997, now here we are heading into 2009 and the creator's of the show Matt Stone and Trey Parker are still coming up with stories based in immature humor but paired with intelligent and witty story premises very relevant to today's pop culture. The twelfth season contains the following fourteen classic episodes as well as some special features that previous sets have been lacking.Britney's New Look - Rather than mock the mess Britney Spears was, this episode mocks those of us who put her there and those trying to take her place.Tonsil Trouble - Cartman ends up with aids, and he's hiv positive that he wants to find a cure.Major Boobage- Kenny gets high off cat urine and lives the 'heavy metal' lifestyle.Canada Goes On Strike- I'm canadian and love that they used us to mock the writer's strike of last year.Eek, A Penis!- Mrs. Garrison comes full circle. Or is that Mr. Garrison?Over Logging- Instead of commenting on natural resource over use like oil or forestry Matt and Trey decide to comment on our over dependency on the internet.Super Fun Time- A pioneer village field trip turns into the plotline of several hit eighties movies when terrorists take over the fun park and Cartman and Butters skip out.The China Probrem- Beijing Olympic's get Cartman paranoid of the Chinese while Kyle and Stan deal with the disappointment of Steven Speilberg and George Lucas 'raping' Indiana Jones for profits.The Breast Cancer Show Ever- Cartman becomes a cancer to Wendy, the only way to stop cancer is to fight it.Pandemic- The boys get Craig involved in a scheme that goes wrong, meanwhile Randy goes 'cloverfield' with his new video camera when furry monsters begin attacking.Pandemic 2- The Startling- I'm so startled, and so is Randy as Craig and the boys finish saving the world again with more unrealistic twists than the latest Hollywood blockbuster's.About Last Night- Instead of mocking the presidential candidates like everyone else we see a twist on their stereotypes when election night turns into a heist movie for the O'Bama and McCain tickets. Meanwhile the boys parents get out of control celebrating the 'change'.Elementary School Musical- I hate High School Musical, and luckily for me so do Matt, Trey and the boys. Rather than dance and sing a boy wants to play basketball but his dramatic father won't allow it.The Ungroundable- Butters unwillingly joins the 'Twilight' crowd while the Gothic kids try to stop the 'vamp' craze at it's source, the local Hot Topic store.This season is the first to be released on Blu-ray as well as DVD, though it appears as standard full screen on the DVD, the Blu-Ray is widescreen 1080i, which isn't quite 1080p but is still High Def ( i meaning *interlaced, p progressive), and will have 5.1 *DTS Audio. The new special features provided are probably better suited for die hard fans or those interested in animation but personally if it's between having these and none at all I'd rather the option of watching these. The special features are:Making Boobage: Behind The Scenes Of ""Major Boobage""-Four scenes from the Heavy Metal parody are broken down and shown to us in several stages as producer Eric Stough gives a commentary on how they blended it all together for a final result.Six Days to South Park, A Day By Day: Making of South Park-This is less featurette and more commentary. It finds the production crew giving a rather long commentary over several stages of incomplete animation discussing the changes that are made on each of the six days leading up to the air date. We get to see 'Super Fun Time' slowly transform from the storyboard animatic stage to the near final cut.Behind The Scenes: ""About Last Night""-This is essentially another commentary by the creative crew lead by Eric Stough. They talk over a rough cut of the episode and discuss how most of it was made last minute on the sixth day of production which was the last day before it aired.Matt and Trey will also provide the same mini commentaries they have provided on every season set since the complete third season. I always find these enjoyable and entertaining. They also manage to give alot of information considering each commentary tends to be under five minutes long. The way they discuss issues really gives you an inside look to how their creative minds work and why the humor of the show is what it is.I'm glad to see Paramount and Comedy Central now releasing this show on Blu-Ray as it makes the already vibrant colors that much better, though some may understandably not want to pay more money for high definition alone, it's perfect for those of us who want South Park in all it's glory. These sets have stayed consistent throughout the release of the series (despite typo's on the first sets), they line up nicely on a shelf and always have humorously picked box art that fits the season. They make it easy as possible to store your DVD safely and access them quickly.I'm happy to see the show hold onto the quality it built up to in previous seasons and perfected in season eleven, despite some slower episodes this season is just as smart overall and certainly as funny. This show has held up where other animated series have fallen apart or gone astray. I often worry that this show may follow the same path but after listening to Matt and Trey's awareness of themselves I don't believe they would let that happen, at least not to the same extent.One of my favorite moments of the season was the boys watching high school musical to see what the hype was about and Cartman's reaction:""Well, I'm out guys. If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.""",N/A
488210,"It seems that Pixar can do no wrong. Again they've produced another masterpiece with the release of Wall-E, which is as lovable, captivating, and entertaining as all of the other Pixar films thus far. In spite of this, however, audiences should not be expecting the usual Pixar style with this movie. The focus is not necessarily on dialogue or humor in Wall-E, but rather takes a new approach which delivers the story at an angle which puts more emphasis on a fascinating series of events, impressive animation, and discovering an innovative way of looking at its characters. With most of the main characters being robots with mannerisms and speech patterns very different from past Pixar characters (such as bugs, humans, toys, or monsters), the movie proceeds in a very different fashion but pulls off the effect flawlessly. Even a few non-animated segments are blended into the film, but setting aside the differences I was still able to enjoy another fantastic movie from Pixar. I connected a lot with the characters of Wall-E and Eve, and very much liked the plot and depictions of the future. From the trailers you can hardly tell what the plot will be, which made me even more interested to see how things folded out. I highly recommend this movie, and rate it five stars. Even though it's not my favorite Pixar movie (I'd say it's better than Cars and Ratatouille at least), it's still a classic and well worth watching.",Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)

883992,"Before I purchased this set I spent some time on the Internet looking for any kind of review for this item, to see whether or not, since I already owned the individual remastered special editions, this was worth the upgrade.But, there was nothing.So I took the plunge (it helped that the Costco here in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, had the set on sale for $47.99 Canadian, cheaper then even the official site was selling it for) and now, here's what you need to know.First off, the video presentation of the films is the exact same as the individual remastered special edition DVD from years back.Meaning it's watchable, but not the best picture quality out there.One of the reasons for this is that the first two mini series where filmed on 16mm film stock, thus creating a slightly grainy picture.I had hoped that since the extras on the discs where transported onto the fifth disc, that the freed up space would have allowed for better compression, and thus, better picture quality, but that is not the case.Okay, so lets list the pros and cons of this set:Pros:* All the discs are single sided (not double sided like the second and third mini series DVD's in the individual sets)* There's a nice hour plus making of retrospective with Kevin Sullivan and some of the cast members* A nice booklet with production notes and pictures, comes with the set* The price is less than the collective price of purchasing the three mini series DVD's individuallyCons:* The picture hasn't been improved* Other than the retrospective documentary, a ten minute fluff piece on the author, and the missing Morilla's Death episode (which I have yet to watch, so I can't comment on it at the present) everything else is the same as the last incarnations of the DVD'sOf note, all of the extras from the previous DVD's have been carried over including Megan Follows screen test, and are all on the fifth disc.So if you don't already own the individual special edition DVD's, then this set is the way to go, and if you already own the individual DVD's and want more extras, then this new set is worth the upgrade, otherwise this set can be skipped.Hope this helps.",N/A

659153,"I will admit, I was not not a HUGE fan of 'Batman Begins.'  People talked about how great it was, and I'll say it made me a bit skeptical about 'The Dark Knight.'About that, I have laughed at myself regularly since it opened.Without a shadow of a doubt, 'Knight' is one of the best movies in the history of film. Every time I think of what was my favorite scene, or my favorite line, I suddenly think of something else that was just as good or better. I cannot think of a movie that I have seen before that every single aspect makes me realize how much I want to see it again. Christopher Nolan has proved himself one of the best film directors and writers out there. The movie was tragic, funny and tense, almost all at the same time, but one could never question whether it flowed together as one, cohesive piece of story-telling.However, despite excellent performances from Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman, despite superb special effects and fights, in spite of an excellent screenplay...despite all these things...it is the performance of Heath Ledger that is the best aspect of the film. I had heard speculation that Oscar talks were merely sympathy because of Ledger's death, but those talks are certainly doing him a sad disservice. His performance is worthy of any award they can give him. The Joker truly is the ultimate villain, and Ledger made it that way.

371226,"Released in 1939, ""Midnight"" is one of those thirties Paramount comedy gems which is cherished by buffs but often overlooked in evaluations of the best films of the decade. Cynical and sharp with Billy Wilder involved in the script, the heroine is a really tough nut. Amazon have provided a great review so here a few personal comments:- ensemble playing of this standard simply does not exist anymore- Don Ameche plays with real edge in contrast to the insipid parts which 20th Centrury Fox saddled him with. He is virile and magnetic- Claudette Colbert combines her tongue in cheek quality with a really hard edge which makes the heroine a fascinating creature- John Barrymore, in spite of reading from prompt cards, is superb. His constant looks of bemusement and secret delight at the next flight of fantasy of Colbert are at the heart of the cynicism of the script- the film has that glitter which signifies a Paramount product and the director Mitchell Liesen. The women are dressed magnificently- Hedda Hopper, the famous gossip columninst, has an amusing part as a society dame- the film is a great example of what could be achieved with a great script and players in spite of the Hays Code.The print of the film is excellent but the extras are only a ""nothing"" introduction by Robert Osborne and the original trailer.

300580,"Danish film maker Carl Dryer (1889-1968) is considered among Europe's finest directors, the creator of innovative 1928 THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC and the legendary VAMPYR--but some cinematic legends are best left recalled instead of revisited, and such is the case with the latter film.  Produced in 1930, released in 1932, and very loosely based on the novella CARMILLA by Sheridan LeFanu, VAMPYR does indeed have moments of great poety, but on the whole the film is akin to watching paint dry.The plot of VAMPYR is trivial, the tale of a young man who stumbles into a mysterious estate where one of two sisters is under vampiric attack.  The appeal of the film is actually in Dyer's truly remarkable cinematic ideas, ideas that are often described as surrealistic in execution.  Shadows move independently of those who cast them--or exist without any source at all.  Fog and mist drift strangely through the landscapes.  A skull moves of its own accord.  And most spectacularly, the young man experiences an out-of-body vision in which he foresees that he himself will fall prey to the vampire unless he can destroy it.These moments are memorable indeed and there is no doubt the film is visually stunning.  Unfortunately, it is also very, very, very slow.  In theory, this slowness exists to intensify the poetry of the images and a crawling sense of horror; in actual fact, however, I found it simply slow, and that the extremely languid pace undercut both poetry and horror to a very significant degree.  Fans of the film--and it has many--will no doubt curse me as a Philistine and declare VAMPYR is too fine to be appreciated by the likes of me.As in most instances, the Criterion Collection edition offers a group of interesting bonuses.

960543,"After seeing North Country in the bargain bins at nearly every video store, I took the $4 plunge. I caught part of the 2005 film on television, and hey, Sean Bean is in it, so why not?After leaving her abusive husband, Josey (Charlize Theron, Monster) takes a job at the Pearson Mines to support her two children, Sammy (Thomas Curtis) and Karen (Elle Peterson). Her father Hank (Richard Jenkins), also a miner, disapproves of Josey's job, as do most of the male miners. Union representative Glory (Frances McDormand, Fargo) tries to keeps the hazing of the new female minors to a minimum. Unfortunately, Glory can't keep her tough exterior while her health is failing. Her husband Kyle (Sean Bean)-previously injured at the mine-must care for Glory. Josey's Mom Alice (Sissy Spacek) offers support where she can, but after one too many incidents at the mine, Josey turns to ex hockey star turned lawyer Bill (Woody Harrelson) and takes the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit to court.Clearly meant as a vehicle for Charlize Theron, the Oscar winner gives a fine performance here along with other such female Oscar heavy weights as Spacek and McDormand. The faults with North Country are not with the cast. In their brief scenes, Woody Harrelson and Sean Bean support the ladies very well, but it is as if they don't have enough to do. The leading women also don't seem to be as moving as they could be. The talent was definitely there for North Country, but director Niki Caro and writer Michael Seitzman seem to have missed the emotional mark.Based upon the book by Clara Bingham, this true story about women fighting back against sexual harassment should be more moving then it turned out onscreen. After years of courtroom reruns on television, the legal scenes in North Country seem stilted and on the cheap. Woody Harrelson is capable of the courtroom charisma needed, as seen in The People vs Larry Flint, but it seems as if the history making legal precedence is set aside for chick flick moments.The North Country DVD does have a brief deleted scene reel, and for once, these pieces should have been left in the film. Several key conversations between each main cast member were left on the cutting room floor. Some have dialogue, and some are just lengthy moments between the leads, but these scenes add some of the depth needed. At exactly two hours, North Country seems a bit short nowadays. All the pieces to the puzzle are there, but North Country doesn't quite deliver.Men probably won't like this attempted gun-ho women's picture, but younger folks may not either, largely due to the eighties look of the film. North Country's setting is cold Minnesota, 1989-and the hair, costumes, and production look it. I must, however, say the ice hockey presented actually looks authentic-not an easy thing to find! Unfortunately, the DVD contains only the deleted scenes, the standard subtitles, and a brief behind the scenes with the real women of the class action lawsuit.Instead of directing audiences to `stand up' for themselves and other against abuse by going to a website, here was another missed chance to get seriously exhaustive about the issue of filming what is still a touchy subject. How did Theron prepare? Was it rewarding or difficult for the real victims to see their tale onscreen? What does the real mining company have to say about all this? Sadly we just don't know.Although North Country didn't quite hit the nail on the head, the film is just right for a certain audience niche. Women and victims of abuse will find the film worthy, and students learning about such lawsuits might help themselves with a viewing. No one here has a glamorous role, but fans of the cast will no doubt tune in as well. North Country brought to light a very important subject, but the next step was there for the taking.",N/A
245705,"Let me be upfront: Melanie Griffith is my favorite actress. There is a naivete about her that is both endearing and attractive. There are actresses who always exhibit certain traits no matter what role they play or how well they play it: Diane Keaton, Jessica Lange, and Goldie Hawn. Add Melanie to the list. She speaks slowly and softly in a measured sort of way. These traits are used to perfection in ""Born Yesterday"" and ""Paradise"" where they are key to the character.So, it is bizarre and simultaneously perfect casting to hire Melanie as an action hero. Only a vulnerable woman could portray a supposedly hardboiled tracker who serendipitously falls in love with her client. Lovesick and distraught over the loss of his Cherry 2000 bot, Sam reluctantly hires Melanie, a mere woman, to fetch a replacement bot stored in the badlands of a post-apocalyptic West. Why she falls in love with him is anyone's guess. Here's mine. Considering the men she sees on a daily basis--psychos, wackos, and dirty, unattractive edge dwellers--Sam looks like every woman's dream man. Although he is physically attractive, a man whose dream woman is a bot is seriously lacking essential brain matter. However, if I were to acquire a bot that looked like Gerard Butler, who adored me and wanted to please me and only me, well, ok, I get it now. A perfect bot as the dream woman. Sam, go get your bot.Now to the nitty-gritty: Their first obstacle is the barricade just outside the edge of town, designed to destroy a vehicle, but this vehicle--a muscled Ford Mustang-- bulls itself through without serious damage. Then E positions her car j-u-u-u-st right for the Great Magnet. When she climbs out and hangs off the car, to tie the rope on, I really want to laugh. Then the Uzis fire bullets all around but ne'er hitting them yet their guns hit the bad guys. Oh, the dead driver of the magnet keeps falling just right to shift the right gear to move the car right along into perfect position. Then get that car into the drainage ditch. Say wha? And she says it was easy this time.Oh, let's visit Uncle Jake, the famous retired tracker, who taught E everything he knows, for food and a safe place to sleep. How convenient!Let's repair an ancient airplane, get it off the ground amidst a hail of unfriendly bullets. Run into Ginger, the old girlfriend--ok, I see why he went to a bot--Ginger is another wacko, especially after Len is killed and she is concerned about those sandwiches. Of course, this strange behavior could be a cover for her disorientation now that her meal ticket is dead.And, oh, Sam learns that bots cannot truly replace a living, functioning human woman with a mind of her own to challenge,  to admire, to love in unpredictable ways. In the final analysis, bots are predictable. One of the most deadly killers in a relationship is the same ol, same ol--predictability.Overall, this is a fun movie. Yes, it has silliness, but that is part of its fun. Seeing tiny, dainty Melanie Griffith as an action hero shooting bazookas is the best fun of all. But the very best part is the wild red hair!",N/A

Set during the War Between the States, it is an unusual film in that it actually gives the reasons for the Southern point of view, instead of just the typical South bashing prevalent in War Between the States movies.  Unfortunately, it falls short of being a good movie, mainly because of the constant use of flashbacks and the switching back and forth between time periods to the point where it is confusing.  Also, the movie was too serious all the time.  There were scenes where lightheartedness was called for, such as in the beginning early courtship stage of the love story, which would make the viewer get more involved in the plot.  Also, it is kind of shocking that the descendants of the couple would include a risque love scene of their own ancestors.  Times sure have changed!

1080592,"The first thing that jumped out at me while watching THE WAR was how much film and newsreel footage from World War II I'd never seen before.  And I've seen World War II documentaries my entire life!My grandfather was shot down in Italy (he lived after ditching in northern Africa) and I've worked with Vets all my life.  I nearly know the great WWII movies by heart, from BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY to PATTON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  I'm also a big Stephen Ambrose fan and heartily recommend his great books such as ""D-Day"" and ""Citizen Soldiers.""

Sweeping and yet personal, it's an epic with an eye on detail.By including the testimony of African-Americans and Japanese-Americans, I feel like I have a more complete picture of life in that time.

659666,"Just when it seemed that Marvel was going to take DC out of the picture with Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk (Two very good movies), The Dark Knight blows both of them out of the water. In fact, Iron Man and TDK have been looked at as a new breed of comic book films. No longer do the characters seem extraordinary that we can't believe that they're real. And the best part is that Dark Knight cements this.Above all I have to say that the film is most notable in its fine acting. Bale continues to prove that he is a virtuoso actor as the dashing Bruce Wayne and the ever brooding Batman. Gyllenhaal also gives a stellar performance that is far superior to her predecessor (Katie Holmes). Aaron Eckhart is both dashing as Harvey Dent and disturbing as Two-Face. And of course I cannot even forget the highlight of the film as its villian, The Joker (The late Heath Ledger). Ledger proves he gave his all and possibly is life to bring this legendary villian to the big screen in a superior performance over Nicholson's previous Joker 9 years ago. It is a guarantee that he should receive an Oscar nod.To begin with, Batman has grown to be somewhat of a boogeyman to the criminals of Gotham City and has given the citizens of Gotham a new reason to feel relieved. Add a new and successful District Attorney like Dent and the dawn seems to be closer than expected. However, where there is light, there is darkness, which comes in the form of the Joker. The Joker plans to set an example for Gotham and attack not only those who defend Gotham, but the very soul of the city, creating chaos and panic everywhere. After his first confrontation, Bruce realizes the lengths he must go in order to stop men like The Joker and wishes to end the situation before things get out of hand. And knowing he Joker, things will get out of hand.As said before the film features an all star cast and crew that deserves every award they can get their hands on. The Nolans have made a tight, though lengthy story that gives the audience a sense of true morality throughout Gotham that the previous movies have never shown before. This is top quality writing and directing, which should garner plenty of attention. Once again Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard have devised a terrific and haunting score that even makes the Joker seem more unnerving. I was impressed by the numerous CGI effects that don't even appear like computer animated images at all and the heavy cinematography and editing. All together this is a great film that has even made history already as the second highest grossing film of all time. There have been assurances on an inevitable third film, which may feature The Riddler, Catwoman, or Bane as the chief villian. Either way I expect great things.",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Richard Widmark plays Capt. Adam Jones who is hired for a mysterious mission to trail a freighter in an old Japanese submarine.  He hires some of his old Navy crew and takes the famed atomic scientist Prof. Montel (Victor Francen) and his assistant Prof. Denice Gerard (Bella Darvi) on board as the directors of their mission.They run afoul of Korean defenses including a very good sub battle, an island raid, and the final conflict I will leave to you to experience.  Widmark carries most of the dramatic load, the crew provides a bit of pathos and some enjoyable comic relief.  Victor Francen is believable as the bearded scientist and Bella Darvi looks pretty enough on screen (but not a real actress).The special effects were very good for their time, but the Cinemascope cannot be appreciated on your TV no matter how high the quality or its dimensions.

1130647,"This one starts out fairly well and cruises along pleasantly right up until Dan's family is introduced.  I'll give it two stars only because there are a few funny moments here and there, but they only serve as false hope.  Steve Carell is great and catches your interest right off the bat, but, the film SERIOUSLY derails during the shower scene in my opinion.  Everything followed a fairly realistic and somewhat humorous approach until Dan's love interest hops in the shower.  It was like a train hitting a wall at that point.At the immediate point she jumps in the shower, I remember thinking, this is going to start sucking now.  And...oh....it does.  It's like two different directors worked on this.  The one who took over after the shower seems like an intern perhaps.  You are then treated to a never ending barrage of ""family"" group activites which are so over-the-top corny that you will surely cringe.  All I can say is there is far too much singing involved.  If you're on my wave length at all, that's all I need to say.Carrell gets the two stars, but the rest of the cast is unremarkable and slightly annoying.

1167987,"I hate remakes, KAIRO (Pulse) was a Japanese horror film that is quite iconic despite its slow-moving screenplay but it managed to generate a calculated, darkly sinister meditation on life and death with a disturbing denunciation with technology as a destroyer of living humanity. Kiyoshi Kurosawa's defining horror epic revolves around the approach to mortality as seemingly random build ups of related and unrelated events; brought about by a website that brings contact to the supernatural world. 2006's U.S. remake ""Pulse"" misunderstood Kurosawa's main premise and thereby resulted in a film full of creative misunderstanding. In Kairo the science was only secondary, it was more about mortality. ""Pulse"" shouldn't have been an unlimited ""night and weekend"" visual feast of cell phones and computers. This happens a lot of times when American filmmakers attempt to remake an Asian horror film.Sure, PULSE 2: Afterlife isn't a remake of an Asian horror feature. It only expands on the idea of the U.S. remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's KAIRO. Directed and written by Joel Soisson (Mimic 2), the sequel isn't really a major visual spookfest, it does attempt to pull something perceivably new out of the bag; the problem is, it suffers from plot inconsistencies and horror movie clich&eacute;s.The world had been reshaped due to the emergence of ghost via the internet. Cities have been deserted, and the few survivors have relocated in small camps, in areas believed to be `dead zones'. Survivors leave behind electrical devices in their relocated areas. Ghosts now wander the Earth in the form of electrical impulses; they continue to haunt their homes and some are unaware that they are dead. Stephen (Jamie Bamber) must now find a way to save his daughter Jusitne from her dead mother Michelle.All right, at first I thought I was about to watch a George Romero feature with ghosts in place rather than zombies. Truth be told, such a film would have been more interesting. I'm not really sure why they felt that a sequel would be necessary (then again, I don't know why they keep on remaking Asian Horror films). The film picks up from the supposed remnants of the first movie. People do know that something had gone terribly wrong and they try to survive.Director Joel Soisson does try to make some sense on the myth that is ""Kairo"". I have to credit the man for trying to explore the myths of the spirit world. This time, he focuses on a father and child being haunted by a dead mother. The film does somewhat feel like a ""custody battle"" being fought between the material and the spirit world. While he tries, he falls to the same clich&eacute;s in horror films, I can't really blame him, he had so little to work with and as I've said, even the first film greatly misunderstood Kurosawa's iconic horror film.The film is actually a chase film of a sort. Stephen isn't really the perfect dad, he had an affair that somewhat justifies his ex-wife's anger. Michelle the dead mother is a little underdeveloped and I found it quite difficult to connect with her. Also, the timetable lacks credibility, or at least not really fully explored. The film does try to throw some ideas in an attempt to add some depth to its simple plot. A guy going around looking like a ""Red Riding Hood"" reject is presented but that subplot goes nowhere. (Maybe there's a Pulse 3?) The small town where Stephen and his daughter fled from is also severely underdeveloped. What happened after they left? Enter the nudity.To its credit, the film does have a few spooky images. The idea of the dead not knowing they're dead is an idea with potential. While its visuals aren't really original and looks like a rip-offs from ""The Ring"" or from a Pang Bros. horror film, the film does manage to generate some scares, however cheap they may be. The scenes of suicide presented potential, but then again, that idea can only go so far. The problem with Pulse 2 is that it suffered from inconsistencies in plot. I thought ghosts can only find you when you have a cell phone or a computer, as reinforced by its first half then we Michelle able to follow Justine (Karla Scott Collins). By the brain's electrical activity perhaps? Maybe, but this possibility has no credible explanation. The film just goes into one dead end after another. The film's climax doesn't offer much either, except for the horror that is a possibility for ""Pulse 3"".PULSE 2: AFTERLIFE isn't the worst horror film you'll find out there but you can definitely find something better quite easily. The issues with the film is that it tried too hard to capitalize on the first film's backdrop that it felt a little rushed and perfunctory. The script felt as if it had been rewritten numerous times. It failed to present a single memorable scene and the film just feels forgettable. It felt too textbook for my tastes and followed the same old flaws in a sequel. American filmmakers missed the point of Kurosawa's KAIRO, thinking that it was just another J-horror flick about a journey into the spirit world. I am not arrogant to say that all of them missed the idea but they definitely messed up its reinterpretation. This sequel just further reinforces that viewpoint.RENTAL [2 - Stars]",N/A
105327,"The Postman is a long movie, but it is that length which helps to create the desperate tone of the movie and bring you into the world of the characters.The post-apocalyptic reality which the film presents appears somewhat plausible, but really is brought to life by the individual characters the Postman meets along the way.From the townspeople who he deceives into thinking he is a postman, to his fellow Holenest recruits, to Mayor Tom Petty, each character is unique and teaches him something about being an inspiration, a hero.Of course the most memorable moments are those featuring copy salesman turned military leader General Bethlehem.  The most moving being the final battle scene, where the war is settled by a one on one fight between as the Postman describes them, ""the a** holes who started it"".The only time the length of the movie is evident is during the scenes with the love interest, which really don't add up to much by the conclusion of the film.Again the best part of this movie is its length, which allows the viewer to understand the back story of the characters and in turn appreciate the point of view and needs of each.While not acheiving the status of an epic film, there are some emotional moments and characters you care about.Give it a watch.",N/A
1018334,"One thirdThe Ring+ two thirdsWhite Noise+ a dash ofThe Terminator= a surprisingly disappointing entry into the current Asian influenced horror flicks.The plot is simple.  It opens with a college student that appears to be following a lead on something happening on campus that few are aware of and what happens to him leads to an epidemic of suicides as his girlfriend attempts to unravel the mystery behind his death and those of her friends that follow.  There is a lot of psycho-babble drivel thrown around but no one really seems upset about things like we might be in real life.  This is a direct result of tepid acting, shallow writing, and pedestrian direction.The characters in this story are a group of rather unremarkable and stereotypical college students who are all rather forgettable soon after the film is over and that means that this film never really takes off as we never care much for any of them.  This is what I meant in my headline that this film actually lacks a pulse.  All the males are your typical long, uncombed hair, five o'clock shadow, 20 somethings with little to no personalities.  I can barely tell one from the other.  The same is true for the women who, although pretty, are shallow personality-wise.  This causes the film to lack serious suspense which is created when we care about the characters such as we did with those in ""The Ring"" and ""White Noise"".Speaking of those two outstanding films, this film attempts to mimic elements in them in regards to appearance with its sharp contrasts and washed out colors and the idea that ghosts need conduits to reach us and they don't always play nicely when they do.  Both films also relied upon jolting images that suddenly appear (which has become rather old at this point, much like the overuse of CGI effects)  In addition, this film attempts to tack on the message that we are too dependent on technology which is reminiscent of themes found in ""The Terminator"" films.  Ironically, the film even has an effectively haunting scene in which we see ghosts all over cities and that reminds one ofNight of the Living Deadand28 Days Later.So, with all this negativity, why did I still give this film 3 stars, which means it's good and why did I add it to my shopping cart?  Well, I like the influence of the Asian horror films in that I like the ""look"" of them, the creepiness, the jolting, disturbing images, and such even when the whole film isn't that great.  In addition, while this film certainly isn't original, I do like the components that are copied from better films.  It is still a fun, creepy ride even though we've been on this roller coaster many times before.  Lastly, at PG-13 or even the ""Unrated"" edition this film is one I can watch with my kids (11 and 15).  There are no ""sex scenes"" or anything vividly violent as in a typical ""slasher"" type film.  It's just a creepy film that has some good repeat value.Do I ""recommend"" this film.  No, not really and especially not to those who have tired of this genre already, but those who like this kind of film no matter how redundant or ill-produced, will get a decent kick out of it.BTW:  In regards to Star Ratings, I've read many discussion comments lately that note that 3 stars is poor on Amazon.  I'm not sure where that is coming from as I understand the rating system to be something like this:* = Poor** = Fair*** = Good**** = Excellent***** = OutstandingJust my thoughts on this and I'm sure opinions and interpretations may vary.

418529,"I've always caught this movie on cable whenever I could, as it's a great treatment of the art of acting and the play itself.  Pacino takes us on a journey not only through the play, but also through Manhattan as he drums up interest in seeing the play at a Shakespearian Festival.  Here we hear from erudite panhandlers as well as learned experts on Shakespear and famous Shakespearian actors.  We also see him going through the city looking for locations to film his version of the play, settling on The Cloisters, the museum, and having to shoo away curious pedestrians while he rehearses a scene.  He shows readings with luminaries like F. Murray Abraham; Kevin Spacey and a host of familiar faces from the stage and screen.  We get to hear them argue about what the characters are feeling; how they should react and other behind-the-scenes stuff we don't have the privaledge of seeing otherwise.  There are parties with guests talking about their experiences with Shakespear and street filming broken up by the police.  The actual play is abridged and told mainly in soliloquies by Al between and even during scenes.  He speaks to acting students, cab drivers, and practically anyone else who'd give him the time of day.As an amature actor/director who's been in community theater for a few years, this film offers much in the way of style and thought behind the style.  The actual scenes are studies in minimalism and having the actors carry the play on their backs, just as Shakespear intended.  Even Ol' Willy shows up here and there for comic relief.Even if you're not into acting or Shakespear in particular, this film will open your eyes to the craft and art behind the words.  A true masterpiece of film making.",Looking for Richard VHS
292024,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis was a shockingly advanced film for its time; as a silent film released in 1927, it featured a $200 million budget, took two years to film, and made use of numerous trick composites, massive sets, and over 37,000 extras. Metropolis would pave the way for more recent futuristic tales such asBlade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)andDark City (New Line Platinum Series). At its heart was the moral ""There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator."" Lang's city of the future is populated with gleaming high rises and elevated highways inhabited by the upper class, but it is the faceless sea of oppressed workers that keep its mechanical heart functioning.Joh Fredersen is the brain behind the city, and his son Freder is blissfully ignorant of the lives of Metropolis's workers enslaved underground, until one day Maria appears with workers' children, calling them ""your brothers."" Freder's innocence is stripped away as he views an explosion underground, and his father's apparent lack of concern over the plight of the workers. Freder decides to switch places and become one of the nameless workers, all the while searching for Maria. Mad scientist Rotwang's laboratory influenced films such as The Bride of Frankenstein and nearly all other celluloid examples of what a mad scientist's lair should look like (mysterious bubbling beakers, glowing neon coils). Rotwang was in love with Freder's mother, who died in childbirth, and has created a robot in her memory. The rest of the plot involves a workers' uprising against Joh Fredersen.The original film ran 210 minutes, but due to negative corrosion, deterioration, and lost reels, a quarter of the film has been lost to the ravages of time. However, this 2001 restoration from Kino spliced together rediscovered sequences to bring the film up to a respectable running length of 147 minutes. There is a brief documentary (in German with subtitles) of some of the painstaking digital restoration process, along with before-and-after comparisons of the original damaged negatives.The allure of Metropolis is more in the power of its visuals and fantastic imagination rather than plot; I found myself somewhat lost, and the restored version uses added cue screens to describe action taken from ""new"" footage. It did seem to be overly long, but the amazing visual feats more than made up for a perceived lack of depth. The ""overacting"" style was common in silent films, as performers were expected to emote via body language, much like vaudeville performers would in order to reach the back row of seats.Metropolis is worth seeing at least once in order to appreciate one of the gems of German Expressionism, with its dramatic camera angles, highly stylized sets, and use of shadows and theatrics. The Kino restoration is amazing, and there are numerous bonus features such as commentaries, production stills, architectural sketches, costume designs, and various promotional posters that really bring the lost world of Metropolis to restored life.",Metropolis Moroder version  VHS

As a matter of fact, I thought the physique of Sally Hawkins suited my imagination of Anne Elliot the best out of all 3 I have seen. Yet, the way she was directed was horrendous. She is constantly running after Captain Wentworth (and not only in the last ten minutes, what about the concert scene?). I also much preferred the older Captain Wentworth (played by Ciaran Hinds). He seemed to show a lot more emotion while still staying true to Wentworth's steely character. Finally, why on earth was this one cut so short? We hardly saw anything pass between the main 2 characters and the cousin Mr. Elliot character was just a silhouette in the background. Very odd and poorly done.",N/A

On the other hand the fact that it is shorter in length makes it much more feasible for the hundreds of viewings I have endured blissfully.However in nearly every other category I prefer this rendition. I honestly find very little fault in absolutely anything in this movie. The principle actors portray each of their characters in the most beautiful, poetic manor. Particularly I adore Simon Woods as the nave Mr. Bingley, his eyes sparkle and I find myself believing every little word he speaks.Joe Wright did the most admirable job directing such a fantastic film, finding romance and tension in the smallest of actions between Elizabeth and Darcy. When Darcy offers his hand to help Elizabeth into the carriage, the moment is just breathtaking. Not to mention the cinematography and scenery are gorgeous scene after scene.Movie aside, the soundtrack encompasses some of the most beautiful music I could imagine; Most of the tracks by Jean-Yves Thibaudet are in high rotation on my itunes, my personal favorite being `Liz on top of the World.'.It's surreal.

478446,"INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT A:Jackie Chan is an underestimated genious outside his own reputation, the historical importance of his legacy trascends his best known image as a comedian and daredevil acrobat: There's a talented Director and visionary, a man who changed the Action film industry in Honk Kong forever with his personal touch and style in the early 80's, by creating the perfect fusion of goofy physical comedy and incredible restless action with some of the most impressive and dangerous stunts ever displayed on film. This 1982 period film about sailors, police and pirates, was the consolidation of Chan as a star in Asia after his major breakthrought with Yuen Woo Ping's  kung fu classic ""Drunken Master"", and a movie that started an influence to follow from there on in the industry.This is a true milestone, considered by critics not only as the first important Honk Kong action comedy , but one of the best productions of the genre next to Chan's second best directed film, the timeless classic ""Police Story"". Besides being one of his most entertaining and funny movies, the film contains some of Jackie's best stunts ever. We've all seen the reckless and almost imprudent asian stuntmen falling on their heads and backs from the roof to the solid floor in many occasions in 80's HK action movies, but no one can get used to watch Jackie climbing handcuffed to a flag pole, jumping to the top of a clock tower, and then falling to the ground with no protection but a couple of cloth roof tops. And he did it at least three times, two of them registered in this film. Even the MTV idiots getting their private parts bitten by baby alligators, thinks that its totally insane. Outstanding comedy and action, great period scenarios, enjoyable classic soundtrack: This movie defines an era.So Jackie became a hughe international star and the world embraced this delightful character and action hero that he is, and then came the re-releases of his early and most important work to satisfy the needs of us fans. Among those DVD releases, unfortunately we can find editions like this one. Check this out:THE PROBLEMS:- Incomplete, cutted version with english dubbing, and the worst of all, the original amusing and perfectly synchronized music score was replaced by a new, awful synthesized random score, killing the comedy and sucking the joy out of the movie by trying to turn it into the current action flick. I mean, the ""updated"" new cover of the DVD speaks for itself.- The Classic Golden Harvest presentation and original opening sequence with credits, was replaced by a computer generated pirate flag : Jackie Chan's Project A, the new title, makes clear that this release is a mere vehicle to show Jackie to new audiences, with no respect for anything else.- The bar fight sequence is incomplete: The whole ""spaghetti"" incident was excluded, along with precious seconds of the brawl. Nice.- The scene in the gambling house in wich the Sammo Hung's character is introduced to the movie, was completely excluded. Now, he just happens to know everyone. Awesome.- From the Police training sequence, the ""shower"" scene is missing.- The intro of Sammo, Jackie and Yuen Biao in the arrest sequence at the club house is missing. The fight sequences are chopped off too.- The intro of the rifle robbery on a boat at night perpetrated by Sammo and Jackie, conceived as a Pekin Opera satire, is chopped off and ruined by the lack of score, waysting the rhymes and the joke intended.- The pirate assault to the english ship sequence, chopped off.- From then, everything is in place, till the new ending credits. By this time, only sadness for the lost original music score  and impotence for the waysted money remains.Honestly, the picture and sound are decent. But that's it. The intention of this DVD edition is to introduce new audiences to Jackie's glorious past, and in that part only, it delivers. But this is not the final choice for any collector or faithful fan, not for a moment.THE SOLUTION:A couple years ago, FORTUNE STAR released a flawless remastered ALL-REGION DVD Edition, including the complete version in Cantonese DTS, 5.1, and original 2.0 mono soundtrack (Hurra!) with original character voices and music score, all the deleted scenes and outtakes, original HK trailer, and photo galleries. More than any fan could ask for, i tell you.Dear Customer: Look for this edition in Asian DVD stores online, and forget about this Edition. Don't be afraid, they're just as safe and efficient as here, i guarantee.",Jackie Chan's Project A
402223,"On the Beach (Stanley Kramer, 1959)I saw this movie weeks ago, and honestly, I'm still trying to get my head around the idea that Anthony Perkins wasn't playing someone who was doomed while everyone else around him thrived (as per Psycho or The Trial, naturally). However, it's not too much of a stretch; Perkins' character, Peter Holmes, is most certainly doomed. But here, so is everyone else.In case you've never read the book (and let me tell you here that you should do so at your earliest convenience, as it's a smashing read), the premise: the world has gone through a nuclear war, and most of it is devastated. In fact, the only place on Earth humans still reside is Australia. They've been living there for a while in relative comfort, but now there's word of a cloud of radiation sweeping down from Russia, and so the Australians know they're living on borrowed time. While most of them are leading lives of the expected hedonism--after all, when there's no future to prepare for, why not live every day as if it's your last?--the navy are still conducting missions to gauge the speed and direction of the cloud. Amidst all this, an American nuclear sub, commanded by Lionel Towers (Gregory Peck), comes to town with what could be amazing news. They've picked up a distress signal from San Francisco, California. The Americans, with a handful of Australian volunteers (including Peter Holmes), head for the northern coast of America to find out if there's anyone still alive in the northern hemisphere.The movie remains somewhat faithful to the book, though it's a pretty loose adaptation (as usual in the fifties, Hollywood felt the need to inject romantic subplots into everything). Taken as its own creature, though, On the Beach, the film version, is a stunning piece of work, not only because of the movie itself, but because Hollywood in the fifties was not exactly known for its doomsaying. If you made a movie in Hollywood in the fifties, even if it was a monster movie (think, for example, of The Day the Earth Stood Still, Them!, or The Thing from Another World), you had to tack on a happy, or at least optimistic, ending. Not for On the Beach, whose final scene is one of Hollywood's most heart-wrenching, even though you've known all along it was coming.Needless to say, when you have a director of Stanley Kramer's ability heading up a cast that contains not only Peck and the usually-underrated Perkins, but Ava Gardner as Peck's love interest and Fred Astaire in the movie that proved he could do drama just as well as musical comedy, you've got the potential to create a timeless classic. And even this early in his career, Kramer was no stranger to creating classics; the film he made before this was The Defiant Ones. (His next was Inherit the Wind.) As expected, this is great stuff, gripping and relentless. The shadow of extinction hangs over every scene. Even the love scenes. (Especially the love scenes, actually.) Kramer pulled off a masterpiece here. If you've never seen it, get it on your Netflix list pronto. **** ",N/A
1146678,"This was another in a long line of funny movies from Judd Apatow, but with a lot more action thrown in for good measure. Seth Rogen may always sound and act the same in everything he does, but that doesn't make him any less funny. James Franco is the real star of the show. I always thought he had great potential, but he just seemed so bland in the Spider-Man movies and Flyboys. This is a well acted and funny performance. I heard some people on the web talk about casting him as The Joker in the next Batman movie. Whether it happens or not, I now think he has a chance to pull it off. All the other cast members are weirdly memorable, especially the cat loving drug dealer who just won't die.Pineapple Express does get really violent and a little gory towards the end, but it is a good mix of comedy and action.

1135468,"Fans of mecha-themed anime looking here for the next great series may be somewhat disappointed with what 'Aquarion' has to offer.  Coming from a great pedigree (created by Shoji Kawamori, who was involved with 'Escaflowne' and 'Macross' amongst others) the show initially seems to have plenty of promise but within the first 2 episodes fans of the genre will be slightly off-put by the derivative storyline and characters.  Which is really quite a shame because storyline aside 'Aquarion' is a very handsome series with terrific mech design and sprinkled throughout with some truly beautiful background art.As for packaging goes, Funimation has done a great job in putting together a well-designed set with each of the 3 discs housed in their own wonderfully illustrated slimpack cases.  A transparent pencil board is also nicely included and packed within the slipcase.  As expected ample extras are also included (all on disc 3).  They include:+Clean, opening and ending segments+6 minute interview with Shoji Kawamori+18 minute fan Q&A; session with Kawamori and voice cast+4 shorts examining the themes of the showVideo and Audio quality are also consistently excellent throughout.

1069858,"When I saw this movie first listed, I thought that some one had misspelled ""Transformers"" for the title. But, it turned-out to be a separate film entirely. Being curious, I decided to invest the 86 minutes of my night off to watch it.The movie begins by stating that humans had discovered life on a planet 200 million light years away and had sent a message of friendship. The aliens responded by sending an invasion force to Earth which killed-off 90% of humans in a short span of time. The remaining humans fled underground to live and the aliens left the humans alone, as long as humans didn't interfere with them. After hundreds of years, the humans finally embark on an effort to reconquer Earth from the aliens. After the initial attempt fails, a maverick human is enlisted for the second attempt. This human, Warren Mitchell, had been put in cryogenic freeze for an attempted mutiny five years previously, along with some of his followers. Mitchell then reassembles his old team of followers to embark on the new mission. Essentially, this new mission is make-or-break for the human race. If they win, the aliens will be defeated and Earth will be ours again.Now, as far as the storyline goes, there is a lot borrowed from movies and TV series, especially Battlestar Galactica and Terminator, in the ""humans versus robots"" genre. Even Galactica 1980 seems to have inspired a bit in this film, in the form of flying motorcycles. Star Wars fans will also recognize a familiar name in the character named General Veers. I guess the writers decided to take a little inspiration here and a little inspiration there. The human survivors fighting a battle against the android army, which is led by a central tower is a vivid reminder of the Terminators being led by Skynet. Likewise, the entire scenery is dark with a ruined landscape, like the Terminator flashbacks showed in Terminator and Terminator Two. The difference is that the androids don't look like humans and the androids can assume two forms: the mobile biped form and a combat form where they actually transform themselves into a lethal weapon that launches missles. So, the androids can be ""more than meets the eye"", but not much more.Special Effects in this movie were very basic and often look like they were created on somebody's home computer and, at times, reminded me of the graphics in some computer games. The weapons fire looked like something out of an old sci-fi movie from the 1960s. Humans even have fighter planes, although it is never explained how they were created and how the aliens even allowed the humans to develop them, especially the test flights that would have needed to be done for the aircraft. You'd think that an intelligent alien race would have shot those things down when they saw them or destroyed any location where they could have been launched from. So, the aliens can travel 200 million light years in 5 years time and conquer the Earth, but lack basic military tactics, aside from ""find human, kill human"" and launching themselves in wave attacks in mass. Okay, maybe I expect too much in this angle.The quality of acting in this film varies from pretty good to pretty wooden. The characters of Mitchell and Itchy are the best acted, while the others are unconvincing. You don't feel the characters emotions projecting from the screen. All the characters wear black or other dark colors, which blends-in with the overall darkness of the entire planet. There are a few non-Caucasian characters in the film, but most of them are white. But, all the Caucasians are pale and lacking anything like a tan and this is good, since the Sun has been blotted-out for centuries by the aliens and it would be hard to explain a tan in such a place. There are no elderly people or children seen throughout the entire film, with the sole exception of the Chairman. Otherwise, everyone is in their twenties or thirties. All the female characters are hotties, to be sure, while the men range from rugged-looking to average. My favorite character is Itchy, who is Mitchell's buddy and former co-mutineer. I liked him because he seemed to be the most real of all the people in the film.Action scenes, if they can be called that, look like something out of a drama class. You don't feel like a real fight is going-on at any time and there is no sense of anger or desperation projected by the people involved.When I saw this movie, I did watch it all the way through. I will admit that much. If you are a fan of the old Flash Gordon serials, this movie comes pretty close in quality to the SFX and acting from those movies.I was surprised at a little plot twist near the end, which I did not expect and it was only vaguely hinted at earlier in the movie. That twist plays a crucial role for the conclusion of the film and is the only reason I gave Transmorphers more than one star. I never laughed while watching Transmorphers and I was never on the edge of my seat. There are no sad scenes to make you cry. Nothing to make you care about any of the characters or even the whole human race, for that matter.At best, it's a B-grade movie which does seem to borrow heavily from other, successful, films and the effects and acting are below what most of us would pay for to see in a movie, unless you like the low-grade stuff. At $3.99 to rent, I'd advise renting something else that won't make you grit your teeth in frustration at all the things wrong with this film and I sure wouldn't pay $14.99 to actually own it.",Transmorphers
551630,"The use of present-tense verbs to describe events from the past is now commonplace in our post-literate age, especially by historians when talking down to lay people. This script does that, and worse. Consider this excerpt: ""In the 1950s, travel to the Moon is about to become possible because of the rocket. Long used as a weapon, the rocket is the only engine that can be used in a vacuum."" That's not true, and it's the kind of falsehood that sometimes happens when adults over-simplify their subject for children.Or this one: ""But when future generations look back, they may be surprised to learn why men first went to the Moon, because the ancient dream of exploration had almost nothing to do with what was called Project Apollo."" The script reveals that the true motive was to beat the Russians. How typical of Nova to be so condescending to its audience as to assume we have no understanding of the political context. And the truth is that Apollo had a great deal to do with the dream of exploration.Or this one: ""In 1968 men first left the Earth for the Moon. Millions of people watched their journey on television, but scarcely a handful knew how it really began."" Oh, so fewer than six people knew how Apollo 8 really began. Nonsense.Or this one: ""For an astronaut to survive there [in space], he'll need the protection of a spacecraft, or capsule. Even a small capsule will need a huge rocket to put it in space."" Sounds like they are talking to small children.Or this one: ""Lost between the pioneering flights of Mercury and the lunar triumph of Apollo was the program that found the answers. It was called Gemini. Nearly forgotten today, Gemini was the essential step to the Moon."" Lost and forgotten by whom? I sure didn't lose it, and I'll never forget it. I wish Nova would stop making things up and stick to the truth. In what sense was Gemini more essential than the other steps?Nova has it that few people know the true motive behind Apollo, or the true beginnings of Apollo 8, or even the existence of the Gemini phase. But Nova knows. Nova always has the answers, and we are children sitting at their feet, grateful for any bits of knowledge they deem to hand down.The DVD includes the commercials that air at the start of every episode of Nova. I would say that's an indicator of the low esteem Nova has for its audience.",NOVA - To the Moon

It is probably Tyler's best work but when he brings movies out too quickly after the other, he falters. For instance, compare Family Reunion and Daddy's Little Girls. Also, Why Did I Get Married and Meet the Browns (he really should not have cast Rick Fox in that movie at all--terrible move).

Seeing the unrated version at a cheap price ($17 for a new movie!), I figured I'd give it a chance.And I'm sure glad that I did. Kevin Bacon gives a stellar performance as someone pushed over the edge. A normal guy that snaps over the murder of his son and seeks revenge on the gang that did it, killing every single one in the process.This movie is vigilante justice at its best! Bacon puts on a great show and communicates well to the audience. You feel his pain and want the bad guys to pay, just like he does.The action is great and gruesome. Coming from one of the Saw guys, you can expect it to be good. It didn't have over the top usage of the word 'f*ck,' which was nice, especially when movies throw it around so much today. Truly a great flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You know he is going to kill the whole gang the entire time you are watching the movie, but it does a great job of keeping you guessing as how he is going to accomplish and go about it.My only gripe is how long it takes for Kevin Bacon to exact his revenge. While the acting is good the whole way through, except for the lady detective (which could've been a lot better), I wish there was more action spread throughout. Sure there is some in the beginning, middle, and end, but certainly not constant. This separates this from other action movies as it only happens in segments rather than constantly. That being said, this is actually more of a drama than an action movie and shouldn't really be viewed as one.In the end, I was left wanting more carnage, especially after not seeing Bacon kill the gang leader.

23883,"Ingmar Bergman's early film Dreams (1955), beautiful but sadly underrated and little known, presents the stories about two dissimilar women and their loves,  and touches on all the timeless and tough realities of torment, longing, loneliness, and aging in a simple  and sublime way.  Everyone who ever was madly and desperately in love and for some reasons could not be with the object of their longing should appreciate this film.  Speaking of making Dreams, Ingmar Bergman comments, ""By this time Harriet [Andersson] and I had terminated our relationship, and we were both feeling quite sad. Our sadness weighs down the film"". Bergman regulars Harriet Andersson and Eva Dahlbeck (both will play in the same year's Smiles of a Summer Night, a very successful and sparkling Bergman's comedy) portray two women, the owner of a model agency (Dahlbeck) and her top model (Andersson).  A major figure in Ingmar Bergman's films of the 1950s, Eva Dahlbeck was stunning - an elegant, poised, sophisticated classical blonde beauty with high intelligence and the talents in acting and writing.Harriet Andersson was discovered at the age of 20 by Ingmar Bergman who made especially for her screen debut the film ""Summer with Monica"".  Extraordinary and versatile as an actress, her roles ranged from the naive young girls with erotic charisma to the young woman losing her grip with reality in Through a glass darkly (1962) to the fearless breakthrough performance as a dying woman in Cries and Whispers.  In Dreams, she is absolutely charming.  Camera loved her - sexy, sweet, and innocent, she lit the screen in her every scene.",N/A

I'll bet that the same redneck who'll label a fine movie like this un-american would complain that some klansman lynching photo was propaganda, that we'd have to get the klan side of some black man being roasted for whistling at some white woman. If you want to rate the movie's merits, fine, but keep patriotism out of it. No one's more patriotic than people who'll fight and die for a country that deprives them of the basic rights of full citizenship.

395392,"For me, the part where Rocky II failed were the Adrian scenes. I loved the new developments in Adrian and Rocky's relationship, through the not-so-romantic proposal (my heart still melted though) to their son being born (more about him later.)I won't ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but there's a whole chunk of the movie where Adrian doesn't do anything. Therefore, Rocky doesn't do anything. The whole sequence was overly long, and could have been cut down a bit.Rocky II follows straight on from the first one. With an overly long flashback to the end fight of the last one. Which may work if you haven't seen the first one in a while, and be needing of a gentle reminder, but I saw these a week apart!There's nothing different between this an the original, Rocky & Apollo Creed are fighting again, we've met all the characters already, and Adrian & Rocky's relationship develops quickly. Adrian gives birth to a gorgeous baby boy, with a head of black hair, which instantly made my womb (that is on the list!) skip a beat. He is so gorgeous! It's pretty much an uplifting story, with Rocky going through a character arc, and struggling with what happens in the weeks/months after the fight. He goes on a small shopping spree, fast cars, nice coat for the wife, nice coat for himself and a luxury apartment that they can't really afford. But the money doesn't last long - not with the rate he spent it - and he finds himself running broke, and itching to fight again.So far, I've seen Rocky I, II, III, IV (the latter of which I nearly forgot about!) and Rocky Balboa. This is definitely the weakest in my opinion. But mainly because of the scenes with Adrian. Otherwise it's good fun.",N/A

221781,"Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator. He solves all sorts of marital issues by providing suspecting wives or husbands with photographic proof that their loves ones aren't so loyal. When a high falooting dame struts into his office asking him to follow her wealthy husband around, he thinks nothing of it but the big paycheck it will bring him. Soon, though, he finds himself investigating a murder and some deeply seeded corruption among the leaders of the community. Complete with femme fatal, the real wife of the deceased (Faye Dunaway), this story mirrors the film noir genre of the 1940s and 50s.The film starts out slowly but toward the end picks up rapidly for a startling and exciting finish. The use of 1930s decor is impressive; nothing seems to be used for the sake of art. Everything is seamlessly utilized by the actors so they appear to be living in the era, not merely participating in a costume film. Director Roman Polanski brings an exciting film movement into the modern era with use of violence and sex but none of it in excess. Viewers are not overwhelmed because no tactics are utilized without reason. Everything has its purpose; the deliberateness of the film makes it masterful.Some might be put off by certain elements of this movie, especially those who prefer the class of classic Hollywood. This film spares no one and shows that even the most admirable characters have their demons.",N/A

687202,"I wish I could understand in this day and age what exactly it is that makes a cult film. Quite possibly, it could be the following that film has and how rabid they are about the film itself. It's true that Donnie Darko has one of the most intense followings a film could ever ask for. The fans of this film has dissected it from the inside out, trying to explain each and every little facet of the film. Which is cool, if you're into having information spoonfed to you and not really interested in figuring it out for yourself.However, I find that to be the most interesting and entertaining aspect of this film. Nothing is really explained in full, but it's not so vague that it's completely impossible to understand. Richard Kelly wrote a brilliant script, full of true emotion and at times horror, complete with science fiction elements so strange it will be hard to wrap your brain around them if you're not entirely into this kind of film. It certainly is not for the casual viewer.But with the Director's Cut, we get a whole new look at the original Donnie Darko, with over twenty minutes of additional footage and a whole new soundtrack.Before Bubble Boy and Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal established himself as an incredible actor with his portrayal of Donnie Darko. Indeed, it is the acting in this film that makes it so powerful. The interaction between the family, especially Jake and real-life-sister Maggie, and the dinner conversation between the two, makes you believe that these two really are siblings in the context of the film and doesn't feel like just two actors going at each other's throats. Maybe it was just the fact that they grew up together that made it so believable, but I tend to lean more towards the fact that the two were just great actors as it was, and used the influence from their lives together to craft a bond between the two characters. And of course, Jena Malone is fantastic, as she always is, as Gretchen Ross, Donnie's girlfriend and unfortunate victim in the whole scheme of things. But there isn't really a weak actor in this film, they all do excellent in their roles, and it all just seems completely believable.The cinematography is also top notch. For a first time director, Richard Kelly really knows what he's doing and always manage to find the most beautiful and effective shots to emphasize what's going on in the scene. That's what's beautiful about this film- there isn't a shot that is just there to further the movie, every shot is there to increase the impact of what is going on in the story. Even in the simplest shots, there is something special about each one that I rarely see in films.Also with this Director's Cut, Richard Kelly changed the score around, which was hit and miss. Most of the time it was a hit, but I miss hearing Echo and the Bunnymen playing during the opening scene. INXS's Never Tear Us Apart isn't bad, but I remember falling in love with The Killing Moon because of the original cut. Basically, that's my only gripe about the change in score, as everything else works perfectly.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko and want a film that isn't a spoonfed 'here's what's going on' formula, do yourself a favor and see it. If you loved the original cut, chances are you'll love this one too. This is a film every should see at least one time, even if just to say you did.",Donnie Darko
1119525,"With quality acting performances all around, EASTERN PROMISES delivers a taut story about the Russian mafia. Viggo Mortensen plays the chauffer/bodyguard to the alcoholic son of a Russian mob chief, the elder wishing to keep certain deeds secret. A diary pops up with incriminating facts and the plot cranks up like the motorbike that female interest Naomi Watts rides around town, trying to find a home for the baby of an abused underage girl. But, for me, the plot is secondary to the interesting peek into another world, a world of hard Russian criminals, speaking half Russian and half accented English, some having escaped from the KGB in their homeland, and wearing tattoos like dark graphic novels about their past trials and affliations. There is a brutal fight scene that is flinchingly violent but, for the most part, the violence is implied in a glance or a word. Certain to be a classic of crime noir.",N/A
1162780,"In 1941, Alice Faye was at the peak of her success. Her films were usually made to a very successful formula whereby she suffered at the hands of an insensitive leading man - singing through tears. This film adheres rigidly to the cliches, combining scenes from ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" and ""Tin Pan Alley"", set to the advent of radio. The merits of the film are obvious:- Alice herself, bright, amusing, energetic and very pretty- A lively Jack Oakie on board for some hokey comedy- John Payne, more animated than usual and with a real rapport with Faye- first rate direction from Archie Mayo, a more dynamic director than the usual 20th Century Fox house directors. The film moves along with such speed that the cliches can almost be ignored- an excellent Harry Warren score, particularly the haunting ""Where you Are"" which Alice sings in loving close up with the Ink Spots harmonising in the background- outstanding supporting acts including the devastating dancing Nicholas Brothers and the witty and clever Wiere Brothers.The production values are first rate with that great Fox sound and photography. As a history lesson, the script contains its share of inaccuracies and Faye's clothes are 1941 modern even though the film starts 20 years earlier but that was all part of the escapism.The print has been restored and is in great condition. A very entertaining documentary is included. It ensures that the modern audience understand exactly how important radio was at the time and why the historical aspects of the film resonated with many members of the audience in 1941. The original trailer is included and the usual stills and advertising material. It seems that Alice Faye's qualities of warmth and naturalness are being rediscovered as well as that beautiful voice and this film is a worthy contributor to her re-birth.

THE LEGACY OF STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN,  focuses on Austin's MATCHES, unlike other previous efforts,such asWWE - 'Cause Stone Cold Said Sothat more or less, dealt with his humorous,out-of-the-ring theatrics. For those new to ""The Rattlesnake's"" career, Austin's wrestling style revealed his admiration for the work ofsome of pro-wrestling's most notorious hellraisers: Lou Thez, The Road Warriors, Harley Race, Terry Funk and ""The Ace"" Cowboy Bob Orton, Austin took from these men what he could; combined their ""signature moves""  with his God-given gift for gab, to create a diverse and entertaining wrestling arsenal. There is action galore in this collection where Stone Cold battles the likes of  Bret Hart, The Undertaker, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, The Sandman and of course, hisarch-nemesis, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson!This 3-disc collection is divided into three stages ofAustin's career, from The early years, to the ascent to the top of the wrestling world then concluding with the ""Last Hurrah"". In (thankfully) brief segments, Austin recalls his stints in the WWE and WCW, of course, but a welcome surprise is the emphasis he places on the first promo he cut for ECW, an anti-Bischoff,anti-Dusty Rhodes rant that seemed to excite his fellow wrestlers who were looking on, revealing a hint of the greatness that was yet to come. For added value, the WWE packagers also included on each disc's menu page, the songs ""The Stone Cold Theme"", ""Hell, Yeah"" and ""Unbreakable"", all of which I gleefully let play in their entirety before watching the matches.And what matches! Some of these were released for the first time on DVD and they feature ""Stone Cold"" at his best: nearly uncontrollable mayhem in the tradition of the old NWA!

Yokozuna) but the hi-light of the set is the ""Three Stages of Hell"" match Stone Cold had with Triple H at 2001's NO WAY OUT  pay-per-view, a grueling ""best of three""-fall rumble that ended inside a steel cage; both men struggling to out-do the other in what became a battle of wills!Face it, this  is the best WWE collection sinceWWE - The Ultimate Ric Flair Collectioncame out a whoppingfive years ago!

1033420,"""The State Within"" is a pleasing thriller on just about every count.  The acting is good (especially Jason Isaacs as Sir Mark Brydon, British ambassador to the U.S.; Ben Daniels as Nicholas Brocklehurst, British spyguy; Eva Birthistle as Jane Lavery, civil rights attache at the British embassy; and Marnie McPhail as FBI agent George Blake--she's particularly impressive).  The script and plot are good:  intricate, brainy, but not impossibly so.  The cinematography is good.  And the basic premise of the show--that it's frequently in corporate and political interests to start wars--is all too true, as recent events have sadly shown.In addition to all this, it can hardly be denied that the BBC is taking a poke at the Bush administration in ""The State Within.""  Instead of a vice president pulling strings and manipulating world events behind the scenes, the film makes the Secretary of Defense, hard as nails Lynn Warner (ably played by Sharon Gless), the eminence grise.  But as the story unfolds, viewers discover that there are powers manipulating her as well, putting a new and frightening spin on Eisenhower's valedictory warning against the military industrial complex.A few earlier reviewers dismissed ""The State Within"" as a bit of U.S. baiting.  But, notwithstanding the thinly veiled allusions to Vice Presdient Cheney, this strikes me as a rather unreflective analysis.  As a major world power, the U.S. certainly takes a centerstage position in the film.  But the theme is more about the abuse of power by international financial corporate interests than about nationalist imperialism.  In a day and age when such interests are at least as powerful as state governments, the message of ""The State Within"" is timely.",N/A

1180516,"I think we can all safely say we've put that 2003 attempt at a Hulk movie out of our minds. Sure it was aweful, and made some of us sweat with sheer hatred at the boredom we suffered. When made aware of this film some simply sighed and said, ""keep Ang Lee as far away as possible"" he's a great director but isn't a comic book movie maker. This adaptation wasn't a sequel, nor was it a reinvention, it was simply a nudge in the right direction and had Louis Leterrier say this is how it should have been done.Ed Norton now takes the role as Bruce Banner and is supported by the sexually appealing Liv Tyler. Yes, I said sexually appealing. The film starts off in Brazil where Bruce is hiding from the United States army and keeping the Hulk at bay. He works in a bottling plant and one day cuts himself leaving a drop of blood in one of the bottles, which makes an un-witting Stan Lee very ill indeed. By the way, off topic a little but can Stan Lee please stop with the cameos. Yeah, we get it Stan, you came up with the characters it doesn't mean you have to appear in every single Marvel movie ever made.Back on topic. The Army track Bruce through the sick Stan Lee and employ Emil Blonsky, a man who's very high ranking in the British Royal Marines and is entrusted to bring Banner back to the states. Things don't go too well and the Hulk is awakened and destroys the soldiers, escaping once again. Blonsky isn't happy and with the help of General Thadeus Ross, he is put in the super soldier program for round two with the Hulk.Meanwhile, Banner wants a cure for the Hulk so he seeks out Betty Ross to help him cure himself along with the help of the mysterious Mr. Blue.I can't really go further into the story as it all comes together at the end in one excellent climax, but as you can see in the cover it involves Abomination in some way. In my review title I mention that this is a nod to everything Hulk and I wasn't kidding. Just the little things you tend to notice more if they're familiar to you. The nod to the TV show with Lou Ferrigno having a cameo and a nod to the games in the final scene, Hulk smashes a police car in two and uses the parts as make shift boxing gloves. Comparing it to the first movie, this has definitely taken more inspiration from the comics. Utilising comic villains and giving a possible hint to a villain in a future installment. The look and general feel of the film are very cartoon like but are still very cool.Hopefully this, along with Iron Man will lead to much more comic inspired comic book movies being made. Sure, you can give us a comic movie with the main hero, but it's not really a comic movie if you take that character and change the world around them. A very enjoyable movie and worth the time, especially for the end fight sequence between Abomination and Hulk.",N/A

1132527,"What a hoot! Starring Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, and Susan Sarandon, this modern take on the traditional fairy tale is a fun romp through all of Disney's previous stories.Giselle (Adams), in her animated world of Andalasia, has the good fortune to meet her handsome Prince Edward (Marsden). The two experience love at first sight. With plans to marry the following day, Giselle heads to the castle in an elaborate wedding gown. Little does she know that jealous Queen Narissa (Sarandon, playing Edward's evil stepmother) and her henchman (Timothy Spall, in a fabulous comic turn) are plotting to prevent the wedding, enabling Narissa to remain queen indefinitely.As Giselle arrives at the castle, Narissa pushes her down into a ""wishing well,"" sending the beautiful would-be princess to a place where ""there ARE no happy ever afters."" This place? Modern-day New York City. After wandering aimlessly for a while, Giselle meets world-weary divorce lawyer Robert (Dempsey) and his six-year-old daughter. (Robert himself is a divorcee, though he has plans to propose to his current girldfriend.)Cheerily awaiting Edward to come rescue her, Giselle calls her animal ""friends"" to help tidy up Robert's messy apartment. (In New York, that means a rather disgusting cadre of rats, pigeons, and cockroaches show up to dust off his kitchen countertops with their tails. Yuck.) She then proceeds to cut up Robert's drapes to craft inventive outfits for herself. Lastly, she wanders into a discussion between one of Robert's clients and her soon-to-be-ex-husband, causing more trouble for Robert. Robert is, by turns, infuriated and charmed.Once Prince Edward, back in the mythical land of Andalasia, discovers what has happened to his bride-to-be, he blunders into New York himself to do his princely duty. From then on, the desires of each character lead us to a satisfying (but thoroughly over-the-top) conclusion.What I find interesting about this movie is that it's a conversation between an optimistic fairy tale and the jaded modern world. Does true love exist? What about love at first sight? When so many traditional fantasies have been debunked, how do we continue to believe in ""happily ever after?"" Or believe in love at all?Adams provides a great rendition of Giselle, a fairytale princess come to life. More impressive, though, are the moments in which Giselle realizes that she might not be such a good fit back in Andalasia now that she's had a taste of the ""real world."" Prince Edward is hilariously written (without malice) as a vapid, vacant, self-absorbed prince. Sarandon gloriously chews the scenery, and Dempsey (as always) provides the best-looking brokenhearted man I've ever had the pleasure of watching on screen.I personally thought the ending fell apart a bit. It was a little too much, and the statements that Disney was going for were a little too blatant. However, I understand that this is a family movie, and some of those choices were designed to benefit younger viewers. At any rate, I don't think the ending detracted too mightily from the preceding action, which I heartily enjoyed.I thought this movie was a great send-up of the fairytale tradition, and I applaud Disney for being big enough to wink at its own narrative history.

1155494,"Red vs. Blue is, arguably, the most popular example of what is called 'machinima'. Machinima is based around the notion that modern computer games have graphics that even just a few years ago you'd need a computer the size a house to render in real-time, so by just recording a game session and getting the players to 'act out' scenes with their characters, accompanied by a voiceover track, you can create your very own movies. Naturally, most of them suck, gamers generally having the patience of a hypersensitive gnat suffering from Tourettes and not being able to agree on anything. Plus a lot of these movies involve guys running around shooting one another on Counter-Strike maps whilst overusing the phrases ""Pwned!"" and ""LOL!"" until you want to actively kill yourself. Or, y'know, just go do something else, suicide is probably a rather extreme and unnecessary action to take in that situation.Anyway, Red vs. Blue is one of the exceptions. Created using the Halo multiplayer mode, it features two teams (you can take a wild guess at their colours and names) guarding their bases at opposite ends of a box canyon. Occasionally it is suggested that they should be trying to kill one another and capture the opposing team's flag, but the lack of any logical rationale why they should do this, combined with innate laziness, means instead they stand around most of the time making jokes about girls and vaguely insinuating the other characters are gay whilst moaning about not getting any reinforcements. It's a bit like a Kevin Smith-scripted version of Waiting for Godot but done as a Seinfeld episode. With guns.Obviously it would be extremely dull if this is all that happened for 100 episodes (relax, they're only 5-10 minutes long each), so the arrival of two rookies, the accidental death of one of the soldiers, the inadvertant capture of the Blue Team's flag and the deployment of special forces operatives to the canyon sparks off an incredibly convoluted storyline that eventually incorporates sentient killer tanks, Spanish-talking robots, aliens, body-hopping AIs and time travel (in an amusing visual joke, characters who travel into the future are converted into the Halo 2 game engine, whilst those who travel into the past end up as characters in the ancient FPS Marathon, Bungie's precursor to the Halo trilogy). The booming success of the series means that the rough-quality audio from the first episodes is rapidly spruced up, excellent custom-made music is introduced and the whole thing becomes more polished. The humour remains the same throughout and is based around the characters: the tough-talking Sarge, who favours ludicrously over-complicated plots in the vain hope that his nemesis Grif will be killed in action; the relatively sensible but easily-annoyed Church who can't shoot straight for love nor money; the psychotic operative Tex; Sheila the sentient tank; and Caboose, the deranged Blue rookie who goes through most of the series operating on another plane of reality to the others and is the character most people either love or absolutely loathe (he's the Kramer of this series, then). The humour is pitched somewhere around the level of, say, South Park. Well, maybe a bit higher than that with lots of riffs on SF movies and games. Actually, it's a bit difficult to describe.Some episodes are exceptionally funny, such as a time travel odyssey which explains most of the series' plot holes, or the episode which is set inside an actual Halo deathmatch and leaves the two characters present in a state of near-mental collapse at the level of insanity on display (""I have captured the flag! Behold its radiant countenance! I am as a god!""). A few miss the mark, but given how long this thing is (it would take you nine hours to watch the whole thing from start to finish) it's surprising how few dull instalments there are. The series became a huge success, and within a year of its launch it was estimated that there were up to 1 million people downloading each new episode. Several of the game characters made cameo appearances in Halo 3 as well.Overall, very funny and worth watching. A bit rough around the edges in places, especially when compared to the sequel series, Reconstruction, but great entertainment.",Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles - The Complete Series

1140067,"Coming across as the unholy union of Ghost in the Shell and Dune, Vexille is one of several recent CGI-based animated movies from Japan (think Appleseed).  Following a US special robot forces operative on a mission to infiltrate an isolated, heavily-roboticized Japan in 2077, Vexille is an unapologetically action-oriented movie.  Do not expect deep characterization or witty dialogue--this movie has neither.  Nor is it--despite the obvious influence of Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed, and other Masamune Shirow works--a true cyberpunk film, as there is virtually no computer hacking (and none by the main character).Although the underlying theme of the dangers of runaway technology is common in science fiction, the simple beauty in which the consequences of Japan's actions are revealed is the best-executed moment in the movie.  Unfortunately, this high point comes far too early, meaning the plot is left to meander toward only a modest payoff (and even that only after some awkward moments which seem to belong to some other movie).Technically, Vexille uses a cel-shading technique, in which the computer-generated actors are intended to look as if they were traditional anime characters.  The effect is so-so here; the technique has been around long enough that it doesn't really stand out on its own and it is not used to any particular effect here--Vexille could just as easily have been a traditional anime.  In addition, some of the slower bits--e.g., climbing stairs--look unnatural.  On the audio side, the English dub (which is what I watched) is executed well-enough and consistent with Funimation's standards, but neither the script nor the animation really reveals much of these characters.  Only Vexille herself and the other main female character, Maria, stand out in the English dub.Ultimately, Vexille lacks the punch to really grab a viewer.  It is certainly watchable and has its moments, but it never exceeds the sum of its parts--and a few of those parts never really belonged.",Vexille - Movie

Soon the two are crisscrossing the globe hunting Samir, who is becoming more and more involved with a cell led by a terrorist mastermind.The film is written and directed as a great thriller with enough action and suspense to keep you ocuupied and guessing, but not to the extent that it comes off like a routine action movie trying to be more than it is. The film has several twists and surprises and keeps the viewer engaged throughout.But everything is held together is by Cheadle, who burnishes his reputation as one of Hollywood's greatest talents.

295792,"Fans of the Three Stooges may find themselves divided on whether or not they like this 1961 re-working of the fairy tale classic. Depending on the age group viewing, children might get bored during the long musical production numbers while waiting for the Stooges to return; die-hard Stooge fans might complain that the Stooges are taking a secondary role, providing much-needed comic relief for Olympic skater Carol Heiss & company; and others might find it a nice change of pace from all the Stooge's usual violent slapstick, and an utterly charming film.To accomodate the plot, Moe, Larry & Curly Joe have replaced the Seven Dwarfs, Prince Charming is their companion on their travels, and of course, there are many musical numbers performed on ice skates to showcase Heiss' talents (along with skaters who are made up in long shot masquerading as the Stooges).But, it's actually the villainy of Patricia Medina as the Wicked Queen and Guy Rolfe as her right-hand man who provide the more delicious moments of the story.It's a rare delight to see the Stooges in a big budgeted production--and in technicolor, no doubt! Their scene in which they return too late to find Snow White fallen victim to the poisonous bite of the apple is well done, and genuinely touching as they openly weep.It's true that the Stooges have done far funnier fare in their earlier years (even their current 1960's features).

659412,"I remember the night I saw this film for the first time, I left the theater catching my breath because it was a tour de force for the mind! I am not sure if Heath Ledger surpassed Jack Nicholson as The Joker but he at least equaled him in my opinion!Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent/Two-Face was definitely an improvement from Tommy Lee Jones' version in ""Batman Forever"" though to be fair, TLJ had a lousy script to work with! Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman were their usual solid selves as Alfred and Lucus Fox respectively.The only performances that I thought were just okay were Maggie Gylanhal's performance as Rachel Dawes and Christian Bale himself as Bruce Wayne/Batman! I actually thought Bale was better in ""Batman Begins"" and Katie Holmes was better as Rachel in that film as well.I loved the plot and the way it was just relentless with only a few breaks in the action. The only part that I have a bit of trouble with is the ending. But then again, this is another interpretation of Batman and may not be the Batman we are used to so I will respect what Christopher Nolan has put together.Other than that, I think this is a great blend of action/drama/adventure but I will say that this Batman adventure might not be suitable for young kids. I know if I had children, they'd have to wait to see that one.Now, as for the extras on the two-disc set, I purchased the Blu-Ray version and this is what I found:Disc 1 - The movie itself is on this one. This also has The Dark Knight IMAX scenes that you can watch along with the film or seperately. They are Prologue, Hong Kong, Armored Car Chase, Lamborghini Crash, Prewitt Building and Final Montage.Disc 2 - I am going to break down what's on here:Batman Tech - Originally seen during the Summer of 2008 on The History Channel, this special discusses the weapons and technology that makes Batman the comic legend he is and shows which gagets are actually possible in real life!Batman Unmasked: The Psychology Of The Dark Knight - This was also on The History Channel during the summer and it discusses the psyche of Batman as if he were a real person with both comic writers and psychologists! Batman's enemies such as Two-Face, The Riddler, The Penguin, Catwoman and The Scarecrow are also discussed. Bats' greatest enemy, The Joker, gets his own segment and is discussed as well!Gotham News - Six segments which are done in the style of newscasts and discusses a lot of things not seen in either Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. It also makes things in TDK a lot clearer as these ""news segments"" take place after B.B. and before TDK.My Blu-Ray experience was crisp and clean! An awesome experience with an awesome movie! The only stories that I ever saw that made me feel like this was the animated feature ""Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker"" and The Passion Of The Christ.

In it are some of the great man's greatest works, scandalously only released in the US on R1(in one fell swoop, the obscene amount I paid for a multi-region dvd player has been rendered money superbly spent).'Song of Summer' is probably the finest, most inspiring film ever made about a composer; 'Dante's Inferno' and 'the Debussy Film' both have a simmer/bellow/simmer/bellow performance from Oliver Reed; 'Isadora' is better than the Vanessa Redgrave film version; 'Always on a Sunday' has a real-life French realist painter being played by a real-life Yorkshire realist painter(!), and 'Elgar' was the first music bio to feature actors, though compromised by them only being allowed to appear in long-shot.30 seconds to read ~ 477 minutes to look, listen and be hypnotically immersed.Possibly the most essential collection of BBC films ever assembled in one place (outside of their vaults of course).

1143201,"I'm not going to spend a lot of time discussing this film, because quite frankly it isn't worthy of that much attention.  But since it is a British period piece based on a prestigious novel, a lot of people went nuts over it.  Essentially the plot deals with a young girl, who driven by jealousy, tells a lie that ends up ruining the lives of two people.  The title, as you have probably gathered, refers to her attempts to atone for this one mistake.  There are lots of things wrong with this movie.  For starters, the acting isn't up to the material.  James McAvoy and Keira Knightley fizzle in the lead roles.  The central plot device, i.e. the lie that destroys their lives, is rather unplausible.  It seems to me that any kind of real detective work would have revealed the truth.  But the biggest problem is that the movie is emotionally empty.  Shouldn't a film that deals with a character's guilt and remorse sting with the ache of regret and sorrow?  You never feel anything for any of these characters.  It's only in the final moments, when Vanessa Redgrave shows up that the film generates any real emotion.  By that time, you stopped caring about any of what was going on a long time ago.",N/A
1133719,"When I first heard that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton were adapting a violent, bloody musical for the silver screen, it sounded absolutely perfect. But could they pull it off? Well, the answer is a resounding.... yes!This is a violent, humorous, and delightfully odd tale of vengeance and madness. It has everything you'd expect from a Burton film: his signature dark, fantastical visual style, beautiful sets, great cinematography, and top-notch acting. But what about the singing? Well, it works just perfectly. Music usually plays a large role in Burton's films, so the step up to a musical feels almost natural. And who knew Johnny Depp could sing so well? He does such a fine job as the titular revenge-driven barber. He definitely deserved his Golden Globe win and Best Actor Oscar nomination for this stellar performance.From the opening credits to the breathtaking final shot (one of my favorite endings in cinema history), this film succeeds brilliantly on every level. It's quite possibly the best film of Burton and Depp's careers. And that's really saying something.",N/A

814618,"In the opening years of the 21st century, J.K. Rowling and Peter Jackson, acting separately, delivered fantasy storytelling out of the shadows to the centre of popular culture.  Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" novels and the films based on them were a new phenomenon, but Jackson's part was the adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic ""Lord of the Rings"" book series for the big screen.  This series of three blockbuster films, the last of which captured the Best Picture Academy Award, is here collected in the legendary ""extended editions"" format, which have much additional footage that had to be cut from the already absurdly long theatrical additions.I'll not recap the plot, which has been done here many times already, and begin by discussing some points about the films.  The main criticism that might be lodged against the Extended Editions of the series is that, with each running circa 4 hours, it is physically exhausting to watch this series.  It is seldom dull, but the length takes its toll nonetheless (I generally watched one DVD per night in my initial viewing).  This matches my experience with the books to an extent.  For all that, the films are a marvelous experience scene-to-scene, and as a whole; just, as I said, long.The first film chronicles the foundation of the Fellowship of the Ring and their eventual dissolution, at which point they split into three plot plotlines, two of which run throughout the rest of the story, which are of unequal entertainment value:1)  Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring is arguably the ""main"" plot of the series.  It can be a bit dull at times, since neither character is much of an action hero (or particularly lively), though it features Smeagol/Gollum (Andy Serkis), perhaps the series' most fascinating and iconic character.  Actors Wood and Astin generate a powerful oscreen bond (which is important, given how many of the scenes are just them).2)  The two comic relief hobbits, Merry and Pippin, are separated from the others, first by Orcs, and then by Ents.  This folds into the third plot by the third film, but the Ent story in the second film is, I must say, sleep-inducing.  Until the siege of Isengard, at least.  Actors Monaghan and Boyd take their initially comical hobbits into some very dramatic and mature plaecs later on without losing the initial spark of the characters.3)  Finally, the plot that would be a great movie on its own, the story of Aragorn's ascent to the throne of Gondor, and the great battles at Helm's Deep and Pellinor Fields.  The trio of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are fantastic action heroes; also to be found here are Gandalf, Theoden, Elrond, Eowyn, Arwen, Eomer, and Saruman.  The action scenes that Jackson orchestrates here are revelatory, and the martial virtues on display evoke the best of our culture's heroic tales.One of hte major issues ot consider is the difference in story between the theatrical and extended editions.  Some of the scenes added are comic, but the latter two films are very much improved by the things that Jackson adds.  Chracter-wise, Eowyn and Faramir, especially, benefit from the extra time.  The extended scenes also explain more fully what happens to Arwen in the third film.  And, perhaps most significantly, they provide closure to Saruman and his pet quisling Grima Wormtongue.For any concerns about length, this series is truly the epic of our time.",N/A

I think it's in ""fluff pieces"" where stereotypes are particularly dangerous: The story claimed that it wanted to showcase how dance and hip-hop transcend cultural and class divisions, but it only served to highlight and exploit these barriers. I hold the writers more responsible for this missed opportunity than the director, though. A few simple plot changes could have given the storyline the level of emotional intelligence that even a cartoon deserves.

667208,"This beautifully filmed movie is an adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel by the same name. The sets/locations are gorgeous, and the acting quite adequate.The story concerns the mental disintegration of a chess master, Luzhin. He is portrayed as a kind and sincere person, though perhaps too nave. As the story progresses Luzhin becomes involved in a critical chess match. The stresses prove too much, leading to his mental breakdown and destruction.Those who have not read Nabokov's novel will probably find the film both entertaining and enlightening, as well as a glimpse into the world of professional chess.But those who have read Nabokov's novel might be disappointed. For the movie simplifies too much. Nabokov had a talent for providing a comic touch to essentially very dark subjects. The movie takes a different approach: it lightens the topic by concentrating all evil into a single character, an unscrupulous trainer/agent. This produces two-dimensional  cardboard characters.Nabokov's book explores the deeper question whether total immersion into abstract mental activities might be deleterious to the human psyche.  A neglected child, Luzhin immersed himself in the rational and secure world of chess. Was the withrawal from the world of social interaction the root cause of Luzhin's problems -- or was there a deeper reason yet?The writer G. K. Chesterton conjectured that:""Poets do not go mad; but chess-players do. Mathematicians go mad, and cashiers; but creative artists very seldom. I am not, as will be seen, in any sense attacking logic: I only say that this danger does lie in logic, not in imagination. Artistic paternity is as wholesome as physical paternity.""After viewing the film I recommend reading the novel -- and forming your own conclusions.",The Luzhin Defence

1188310,"All right, I'll admit it.  I saw this movie on opening weekend.  I will now attempt to review it while also attempting to steer clear of political commentary.  I seldom like to read unabashed commentary from others, and I don't want them to read much of mine!In case you don't know, this film, from AIRPLANE creator David Zucker, is a conservative-made spoof of, for lack of a better word, the liberal mindset or point-of-view.  It is very much in the style of AIRPLANE type movies, but from a humor standpoint, it falls a little more into the SCARY MOVIE level of success.  There are plenty of laughs and plenty of clunkers.  If you don't like these kinds of movies, with rapid-fire jokes, low comedy and nonsensical plots...just steer clear.It tells the story of a Michael Moore-like filmmaker (played by Chris Farley's younger brother Kevin), who has grown to hate America so much that he's actually campaigning to abolish the 4th of July!  He is then visited by three ""ghosts"" (mostly General Patton, but also briefly by George Washington and the Angel of Death), who show him past events in American history and his own life that cause him to rethink his attitudes towards the US.  (In case you hadn't guessed from this description or the title...the premise is a loosey-goosey gloss on A CHRISTMAS CAROL.)The film DOES have some very funny moments.  There is a hilarious bit with Rosie O'Connell (NOT Rosie O'Donnell), a shrill America-hater who happens to look like Rosie O'Donnell (see, the ""humor"" isn't always very subtle)...who screens for Bill O'Reilly (the REAL Bill O'Reilly, playing himself, just like he does in real life) a ""documentary"" she has made showing that we shouldn't be profiling Arab-appearing persons in security lines at airports because there is a ""vast Christian-fundamentalist terrorist conspiracy"" out there.  It's a heavy-handed bit...but it also does a nice job of reminding us just what types of people HAVE actually attacked our country, and that frisking old, white American grannies just to appear NOT to be profiling might be a waste of time.  But politics aside, the bit is just plain funny.There are running gags about Michael Moore...whoops, I mean Michael Malone...receiving no real respect as a documentarian.  (""I have an Oscar!""  ""Yeah, for documentaries."")  These are pretty funny, and provide the main plot impetus...terrorists are trying to recruit Malone to make a ""real"" movie, rather than a documentary, about how great the Taliban and its ilk are.  Malone is actually mightily tempted.Kelsey Grammer plays Patton, and he's pretty much exactly what you'd expect.  Farley doesn't exactly rise to Oscar level with his performance, but if anyone will get a ""bounce"" from this film, it may be him.  He's a nice presence on the screen, and I think might do well with a subtler role.  Other appearances come from folks like Robert Davi and Dennis Hopper (it's fun to see which familiar actors have aligned themselves with the conservative side).  And naturally, Leslie Nielsen is in the film.  By law, he must be in all films of this sort.  Although he's less funny than he's ever been.Jon Voight, in a brief but actually poignant scene, plays Washington.  I won't tell you more...but the moment he shares with Malone on September 11, 2001 is pretty moving, because you don't see it coming.  Yes, it's manipulative...but it also informs the viewer exactly why the creators of this film felt it was so important to make it.Are the jabs at liberals mostly obvious cheap-shots?  Yes.  But conservatives would argue (rightfully) that films like RENDITION & LIONS FOR LAMBS & REDACTED have been little more than liberal diatribes against Republicans.  So it no doubt felt good to get a little anger out of the system...and the film is fitfully amusing.  HOWEVER, if you find you have no sense of humor whatsoever about strongly held ""Democrat"" beliefs...then why get your blood boiling with a mediocre movie.  Republicans looking to get a little frustration out of their system will find the film to provide satisfactory catharsis.  The audience I saw it with was very appreciative of the film, despite its heavy-handedness.  I heard more than one person, on the way out of the theatre, proclaim, ""It's about time.""Do with this information what you will.  I'll give the film 3 stars...thus neither recommending nor condemning it.  See, I'm so fair-minded!",N/A

The most ludicrous subplot features DeVito as a washed-up magician who contemplates a professional comeback by teaming up with the best-selling author and compulsive gambler played by Basinger.  Individually, any of the various plot strands might have made for an interesting movie, but taken together, they just keep getting in each others' way.Veteran filmmaker Mark Rydell has not only helmed the piece but appears in a crucial cameo role late in the film.

I had a couple of free coupons for Previously Viewed Movies at Blockbuster, so while browsing I came across this DVD at the local store and pounced on it like a big woolly mammoth! Upon checkout, the clerk asked me, ""Have you seen this film?""  I answered, ""Yes, and I really liked it.""  She shook her head and said, ""I have to agree with all the bad reviews; it's not even historically accurate.""

Rated PG.*I imagine that some people may be put off by the craziness.I might be a bit biased, since I grew up watching this movie (and the cartoon show) relentlessly.  Still, it really is great.  The story is good, smart, well-written, and has an excellent cast of characters/actors.  The dialogue is funny and memorable.  Above all, it's highly imaginative, with its fantastic settings, costumes, special effects, and creature effects.

1143848,"""Supermarket Woman"" (""Supa no onna"") is the fourth in director Itami Juzo's ""woman"" series, that started with his 1987 filmA Taxing Woman.  All of them follow similar themes, featuring his plucky wife Miyamoto Nobuku who tackles the big boys with nothing more than spirit, common sense and a great big smile.This one tells the story of a local grocery store, Goro's, that has to face a new challenger in the undercutting Bargain's Galore.  The owner of Goro's is despondent, until a chance encounter with former classmate Hanako (Miyamoto) gives him a ray of hope.  Hanako convinces Goro to set up his store around the needs of the housewives who do all of the shopping, and the idea of pushing quality rather than shoddy quantity.The plot is simple, but carried out with Itami's usual comedic style.  The humor is more smiles than guffaws, although there are plenty of laughs to be had.  The theme is still relevant, pitting local small businesses against giant chain stores, and provides a roadmap to success for those willing to fight.Like the rest of his ""woman"" series, Itami does not shy away from sexuality and ""Supermarket Woman"" is no different.  At the time of this filming, Miyamoto was 51, but neither she nor her director husband were ashamed at showing the sex life of the middle aged, and there is one really charming scene in particular.  It is the kind of natural, human way of looking at things that it so often missing from American flicks, where sex must be played for comedy or arousal, and not just a part of human nature.Itami's flicks are just pure feel-good fun, promoting a better world where the nice guys finish first and a spunky young woman can change the world.  He is the Japanese version ofFrank Capra, and while his films can be just as corny they are also just as much fun to watch.  I want to live in Itami's world.",Supermarket Woman

The music is upbeat and the instructor is good.Several of the background exercisers are annoying and whoop and holler a little much, but I can ignore this.

657468,"The two disc special edition with the digital copy of ""I Am Legend"" not only has the version seen in theatres but also an alternative ending - one that has a totally different conclusion than the theatrical release. But it too differs from what was written in the Richard Matheson short story of the same name, and it really isn't that much better, so be warned. The bonus features include four animated short films, all related to the movie. The digital copy (on the second disc with the alternate version) allows you to copy the film to your computer taking up less space on your hard drive than if you copied it from the DVD alone - that is, if you like to watch movies on your PC. There are also bonuses you can view BUT you can only access them by inserting the DVD into your computer - you can't do it with just a regular DVD player. Too much of a pain to deal with, IMO. If you can do without all of the extras included here, then I suggest you stick to the single disc version of this film - it's cheaper.As for this latest version of the famous Matheson post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller (there were two previous ones, ""The Last Man On Earth"" {with Vincent Price, 1964} and ""The Omega Man"" {with Charlton Heston, 1971}), it starts off strong, with Will Smith as the lone human survivor on earth of a virus that originally was developed as a cure for cancer, but went terribly awry, killing most of the world's population. Smith in his role as military scientist Robert Neville (who is immune from the virus) is intense, and his only companion is his dog Sam, a loyal german shepherd that he raised from a puppy. Sam is the only link to the lonely Neville's past and his family.For the first hour or so of the movie, you are totally transfixed by Smith's heartfelt solitary performance and the interaction with his canine companion. In this case, the dog is definitely Neville's best friend - and his only friend, as the two of them depend on and protect each other in a desolate world. We see flashbacks of just how Robert Neville ended up in this tragic and unenviable position. Will carries the film surprizingly well on his own, as he attempts to achieve some kind of normalcy by having conversations with his dog and mannequins he set up in a store, pretending that they are living and breathing beings like himself. He and Sam live life from day to day alone - listening to reggae legend Bob Marley's music for inspiration, send out messages with the hope there is someone else out there like them and fight to survive against violent, blood-thirsty vampire-like creatures (courtesy of CGI) that lurk in dark places during the day and roam free at night. These beings were once human, but they were infected by this virus and survived - and this is what they mutated into. Neville works tirelessly to find a cure before it's too late (""I can still fix this!"") so perhaps these creatures can once again become human.The introduction of two other human characters into the story who have traveled to a decimated New York City where Neville is - this is the point where the movie begins to lose steam. This is unfortunate, because the first part of this film really showcases just how exceptionally good Smith has become as an actor. It certainly doesn't hurt that the guy is so appealing and likeable in nearly everything he does. This withstanding, it's the second hour of the movie that falls flat. Even with the action sequences, it doesn't captivate you like the first hour did, where there was relatively little of that. You don't really feel any emotional connection to the woman and the little boy she has with her; I cared more about the fates of Neville and his german shepherd. I found the ending to be a disappointment, and having read the Matheson novel, I felt that if the screenwriters had remained faithful to the ending of the book, it might have had ended better - not happier because it isn't that type of movie - but at least you wouldn't have felt cheated. The film itself, like the two that preceded it, differs greatly from the book, but some of the changes made here worked very well - and some not so well. But ""I Am Legend"" is worth watching, at least for the first hour and to see Will Smith's amazing performance.Rating: 3.5 stars",I Am Legend

335079,"""King Rat"" is a faithful rendition of James Clavell's fine novel of the same name.  British soldiers (with a sprinkling of American Gis among them) in Singapore were ordered to surrender, and were placed by the Japanese in the Chinga prison camp.  The Japanese completely disrespected the Geneva Convention, and conditions in the camp quickly deteriorated to a very low order of existence in which one's daily caloric intake was at a starvation level, sanitation was nonexistent, and the level of brutality by the Japanese against the Allied prisoners was unconscionable.Within the camp, an American corporal, against all odds, has managed, through his savvy, intelligence, and trading prowess, to survive and thrive.  He has the officers in the camp on his ""payroll"" and he seeks to survive by pitting his wits against the Japanese, the officers in the camp, and his fellow prisoners.  ""Corporal King"" (""the King"") comes to dominate the camp, and this is the story of his struggle.And a great story it is.  George Segal is unforgettable as Corporal King.  This is an engaging film that deserves more recognition than it has received.  Highly recommended.",King Rat VHS
1067706,"Okay, how did I start watching this picture?  I liked the title, which refers to a certain shade of lipstick or nail polish favored by the heroine, Shay Bettencourt (Nikki Reed) which attracts the boy she wants, wealthy young preppy Jordan (Jonathan Tucker).  Jordan's insistent neo-noir narration plays continually over the pretty pictures CHERRY CRUSH delivers, and you get tired of him saying over and over again, ""A good photographer captures his subject,"" significant pause, while the camera pans over 4,000 more vacuous shots of Shay in prim lingerie--then the capper, ""But a good subject captures her photographer.""  Staccato burst of horns.  It makes sense, sort of, but it depends on chemistry, and Tucker and Reed are no William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.  Oh what a mess this movie is, on every level.  Number one, it was ludicrous to set this noir thriller in high school.I know, I know, BRICK did it well, but BRICK was more a story of gangsters and turf and money, whereas CHERRY CRUSH wants to revel in the whole forbidden love POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE thing.  It still could work, maybe, but why hire Jonathan Tucker to play a high school student?  The guy looks like he's about 40 and a CPA.  When he's sitting next to Frank Whaley at a bar, Whaley looks younger.  Well, he wasn't directed to keep an absolutely deadpan face with no expression, whereas Tucker looks as though they injected curare into his facial muscles every morning at the beginning of the shoot.  There's a whole plot in which Jordan is supposed to be on the working board of a huge arts organization in order for his CV to look good when he applies to Cornell.  Jordan (and his girlfriend, equally late 30ish, but apparently also supposed to be 17) is thrust into heavy million dollar fundraising, well, I don't think so.  Why even have that plot, it is so ludicrous.  There must be a million other ways to show Jordan at the mercy of a powerful Ari-Gold type of dad who rules him with an iron glove, so that we should sympathize with his need to be free in some aspect of his wealthy young life, even if it means picking up the trashiest girl in town and becoming part of her web of sin, lies and murder.The biggest problem is Nikki Reed as the vamp--totally inadequate.  She looks like a little girl trying on mommy's wedding gown.",Cherry Crush
1125420,"I was into this one when i saw the previews for it awhile ago.  Jodie Foster plays her character Erica Bain (radio personality) with a passion and vulnerability.  That most don't even see especially considering the circumstances surrounding her transformation.  She and her boyfriend (Naveen Andrews) are out for a walk with their dog in the park late at night.  Not something i would do (but i digress) they confront some guys that have their dog that ran off and expect a reward for it. They only found it a few minutes ago so i dont understand that.  But he refuses and madness ensues after that with him being beaten to death and Jodie Foster being beaten unconscious herself.She awakes weeks later a former shell of herself and unable to make it out of her apartment for several days.  Once she finally makes it out of there and decides on what to do next.  Well she goes and buys a gun for protection, venegance and who knows what else.  There is the detective played rather well by Terrence Howard.  Whom she meets and they start to develop a connection that he believes is innocent.  But Erica knows otherwise as their are vigilante murders being carried out all over the city by her.I love how they show her characters as one that doesnt fit the norm of male killers.  She's doing what she does to help her cope and exist in a city that she once loved but now feels very differently to her.  She also feels like a totally different person as she copes with her boyfriend's death by dealing out her own brand of justice.  Will she get caught or killed herself or will she continue down this dark path of crime and murder undeterred.You really need to check out the Brave One for yourself.

1150089,"""The Visitor"" is the kind of film we need everyone to watch at least once.  It could change the world in a matter of hours.  Tom McCarthy has created a piece of art that is at times magnificent, always graceful, and never misses.Most of the movies to which I would give five stars probably have more great vs. not so good moments.  But for ""The ""Visitor,"" I'm still trying unsuccessfully to think of any short sequence, or even a frame that was not outstanding, or failed to add to the story.Not long into ""The Visitor,"" I began to see that each scene had a significant theme, personality, sound, and visual impact.  Many of these scenes could have successfully stood by themselves as shorts.  Taken together as a sequence of wonderful little vignettes, they made for a very emotional experience.As a private person with an academic background, it was very easy for me to imagine myself in the role played brilliantly by Richard Jenkins.  He makes the highly praised acting of Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation"" look just average.I love the writing, acting and especially the cinematography.  Several times I leaned over to my wife and whispered, ""that was good writing.""  And even now, several days later, I still recall some of the great images in the film, such as the image of that bunker-like immigration jail, or seeing Richard Jenkins through multiple panes of reinforced glass, or behind the criss-crossing subways. Some of the scenes were just incredible - like when the shallow tourist buys the bracelet, or when Tarik's mother lays down with Jenkins (it breaks your heart), or when the immigration clerk asks Jenkins to step away from the glass.  I could go on and on.  These were brilliant moments.Immediately after seeing it for the first time, I decided to experience it again without sound. I don't mean to take anything away from the wonderful score, which was very powerful and important to the film.  But I wanted to watch the images.  Then, I watched it again without looking, just listening to the score, the sounds, and the voices of the actors.  I can tell you, the respective sights and sounds of ""The Visitor"" are so good, that it still succeeds without one or the other.Illegal immigration is a very emotional topic for millions of Americans who will never have any understanding of reality for illegals of today, or illegals of the past (their ancestors?).  I'm sure someone could write a film about illegal aliens who, once they are here, commit crimes or who sit around collecting government benefits. Perhaps in some cases that is true.  But I will end this review as I started it.  If we could somehow get everyone on earth to watch ""The Visitor,"" we would all benefit from the experience of understanding a little reality about someone who is different than ourselves, and make this a better place to live, wherever we live.",N/A
289746,"As you can tell from the other reviews, this is a film loosely, very loosely, based on one of Louis L'Amour's early western novels. I imagine the only enjoyment Louis derived from this film was the money received in exchange for using his book.The book was published in 1955, and the book's title was Heller With A Gun, not the title of this film.  The book languished in paperback from Fawcett Gold Medal mass market books for years before Bantam republished it in 1984, 20 years after being put on film. But in the book King Mabry follows the theatrical wagons after Healy has hired a killer as guide, on a hunch Mabry then follows behind the wagons assuming a 'guardian angel' role. Much different in most respects than the silver screen would have it.For readers of Mr. L'Amour's book this film will seem very strange as the book is at its best a more serious work, however, the film, since it takes a more frivolous approach, can also be of interest. If for no other reason than with all these first rate actors now being either very old or very dead, a nostolgic air of sorts clings to it, and only the most 'die hard' L'Amour fans will find it objectionable.Do what I did:  read the book and see the movie, both in their own way are very enjoyable entertainment.Semper Fi.",N/A

334057,"I sure hope so, because Disney's take on ""Aladdin"" is a wonderful rollercoaster ride of a tale.  Tucked securely in the middle of Disney's animated ""Renaissance"" in the late 80's to mid 90's, this fun-filled story pops off of the screen thanks to a wonderful digital transfer that highlights both the traditional animation of Disney and the (at the time) growing digital animation of Pixar.  This is most evident in the Cave of Wonders, where Aladdin, Abu and the Magic Carpet go for a wild ride as the cave collapses in on them.The plot is fairly generic.  It's a love story about a young man living on the streets and longing to become a ""somebody"" who falls for a young woman intent on breaking free from the chains of tradition.  Throw a power-hungry Vizier into the mix and you've got yourself a basic dramatic love story.  What makes this story more than just another run-of-the-mill animated romance, however, is a solid string of supporting characters who steal the show.  The chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine is nice, but Robin Williams' Genie, who's own longing for freedom is an interesting subplot, injects the story with humor and action.  Gilbert Gottfried's Iago, the highly intelligent and cocky pet of the wicked Jafar, injects humor as well, though with quite a bit more bite than the Genie.  Heck even characters with smaller roles such as Abu, the Sultan, and the speechless Carpet, add fun to the story.Although the soundtrack isn't quite up to par with other Disney modern classics such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King,"" ""Aladdin"" has one of my personal favorite tunes in its arsenal, ""A Whole New World.""  Both the film version and the pop radio cut by Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson are excellent.  This particular DVD features a new version of the song performed by then-married couple, Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson.  Unfortunately for them, though, their version lacks the heart and soul that the film's and BelleBryson's version contains.This platinum edition DVD is a nice addition to any collection.  As stated before, the animation pops off of the screen.  The audio is excellent and the extras are a nice addition as well.  A Clay Aiken video, the original radio version of ""A Whole New World"" video, the Simspon/Lachey cut, and a pop-up information option highlight disc one.  Disc two contains plenty of fun and games, documentaries and other wonderful features.As a whole, ""Aladdin"" is a wonderful tale sure to capture the imagination of children and adults.  It isn't as breathtaking as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" nor is it as epic as ""The Lion King,"" but it has secured a spot for itself as one of Disney's greatest modern classics.

1091153,"That I'm a fan of the show should come as no surprise, considering that I bought the complete series.The 50-odd disks come in a nice embossed cardboard box, with an extruded 'Stargate' on the front. From there, the presentation jumps the rails in a hurry. Once inside the box, you'll discover 2 cardboard books of disks. Rather than set the books up with conventional pages, the books unfold in a cumbersome, multi-folded, gate fold. Each facet of this double-sided arrangement holds 3 disks in tight fitting pockets. It's here that the scratched disk phenomenon arises. (So far, my set has escaped the problem.)The double-sided, multi-folded booklets make searching for a specific disk awkward, but they haven't completely turned the set into a mockery of common organizational principles - yet. That comes when you realize that the colors of the disks are randomly assigned, not by season, episode, nor any other rationale. They're just random colors. So to select say, Disk 5 of Season 3, you have to pull disks from their pockets and read the smallish print to find the area of the book that has Season 3, then keep pulling until you find Disk 5. I have no doubt that this unnecessary handling leads to many a scratched disk. Just as confusing, is the icon in between the season number and disk number. It consists of a pentangle of 5 'blocks', with one highlighted, and a number in the middle. Nowhere is it explained what this signifies.

I couldn't help but notice that the previews for this movie gave NO hint of what the actual story was. Anybody viewing this movie is only in it for the dragon war action which doesn't come until the last half of the movie. Before that, you're stuck with the zero-personality hero who is trying to save the zero-personality girl from the old white guy dressed in Japanese clothes and speaks in a Japanese demonic voice that doesn't match his lips at all.If you're trying to find the worst movie ever made, you must watch Dragon Wars because it's certainly in the running.",Dragon Wars - D-War

1156168,"One is immediately drawn to the thrilling premise based on the eponymousStephen Gould novel(with liberal dilutions to the story) about a young lad named David who can teleport himself. One then sees the star-studded crew behind this caper and is almost certain to savor it: the director of The Bourne Identity, and script writers of Fight Club, Batman Begins and Mr. and Mrs. Smith.Yet, despite all that they ought to have had going for themselves, somehow these cooks managed to make a stunning scattershot mess of this sci-fi broth. They decided, I suppose, that a movie named Jumper would do well with a jumpy screenplay.  Why trouble yourself with exploring the socio-psychological ramifications of teleportation or some such meaningful effort, when you can opt for a wannabe-epic adventure targeted at the nose-pierced crowd?Landscapes switch at 60,000 frames per second. Our hero has lunch in Rome only to digest it all while surfing in Fiji. You know how it works. The teleporting bits are fine, but how a puny little teenager who was chronically ragged by bullies at school learned to do all the funky stuff at will, goes a trifle unexplained.Soon enough, our supra-hero discovers that his abilities have landed him in the persecuted half of an old historic war. Sigh. On one side are his band of teleporting buddies called Jumpers -- all mysteriously young and fit, one quite thoughtfully a British (where were the token black and Chinese buddies?). On the other side are efficient ""Paladins"" organized to demolish them. The chief Paladin is a self-same Samuel Jackson sporting a silver crew-cut.Now, for some uncommon reason, David has a nice revealing collection of photographs at home. Snapshots of *all* the places in the world to which he ""jumps"". Which naturally aids our chief Paladin's search. But not before a romantic angle is tossed in as David takes his high-school girlfriend out to Rome for a swing -- they fly regular Northwest of course, despite the hunt on for his arrest at NSA level.The plot holes are large enough for obese teleporters to jump through. Christensen, an actor chosen clearly to appeal to the younger Star Wars fans, would have done well to consider a repertoire of at least two facial expressions. The final 15 minutes or so have so much rammed into them, with pulse-pounding heavy metal music of course, that one wonders if the film was about to overrun its deadline and had to be chip-chopped in a rush.The loud hints at the end suggest that there might be a Jumper II. Optimistic as that may be, one hopes they will rope in someone else to write, direct, act in, and score it. The theme and Stephen Gould surely deserve better.",Jumper

I've always loved great writing, which could be why I've spent so much of my life trying to create a bit.

Accurate, since we're talking about 30-minute series that are quite funny, but incomplete. In the case of The Office, we have no laugh track, and a grittiness that I finally realized looks a bit like Homicide: Life On The Streets.

He hascrafted another flawed but interesting film, Walk The Line, named afterone of Cash's biggest musical hits; this one on the life of JohnnyCash. Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for herportrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Familysingers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merelyanother way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy youngstarlets- think Marissa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow, JuliaRoberts, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Renee Zellwegger, CharlizeTheron, and now Witherspoon. Financially, for the long term of theindustry, this makes sense, so that, even decades from now, films theyappear in can bear the Oscar imprint.Joaquin Phoenix, who portrays Cash, however, is completely out of hisleague as the infamous Man In Black....Cinematographer PhedonPapamichael adds little to the film. His framing and vistas do littleto enhance texture of the scenes, nor do they add an unconscious poeticelement. Despite globetrotting, Cash's life is portrayed as static anddull, and the love story is nothing great. What Mangold does not graspis that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of hissinging and songwriting. When will biopics about artists actually focuson the art, and not the soap operatic stuff? But, if they are going tofocus on the peripherals, one would think they'd play up thefascinating stuff, the legendary stuff, not the usual crap all peoplego through, for that merely shows that the subject is like the viewer,when the fascination stems from what the subject has that is NOT likethe average person.

So.......10 am on Friday morning, I was sitting in the theater with my wife hoping not to be disappointed.......we were not! The film's opening scene gets your attention and then back pedals a few hours to fill in the blanks. This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where!  Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man or ""ol' Shellhead""....if you will. I think his career is about to take a very big turn for the better after this film! I think he will forever be associated with this character like Toby McGuire is to Spider-Man. I can't see anyone else in either role now.

503377,"In an election year when most voters are wondering which candidate is the least dishonest, which is the lesser evil, The Farmer's Daughter is not only refreshing but instructive. It contrasts a political ""machine"" with a lone, honest voice crying in the political wilderness. Katie is that voice. She is the attractive housemaid of a powerful but amiable family, called the Morleys, who have been running their party's political machine for generations.As one might assume, the Morleys entertain many influential people; but Katie doesn't mind listening to their conversations and interjecting her political views as she hands them a drink or canap&eacute;. Everyone is taken aback by her candor except for the son, Glenn, who is fascinated by Katie, and eventually falls in love with her, as she does with him. He takes her under his wing and encourages her to improve herself by taking night classes. In one class, she has to give a speech, which has her worried; but the family butler, Joseph, who is like another member of the family, introduces her to a little speech once delivered in the Senate by Glenn's deceased father. Katie's simple reading of it moves Joseph and Mrs. Morley.Eventually, the family realizes that Katie does not approve of their party's candidate for Congress, and she speaks out against him in a town meeting. When the opposition party hears her, and likes what they hear, they talk her into running on their ticket. Katie's three brothers leave the family farm to come and help with her campaign. But it doesn't go well at first; until Glenn advises that she stay honest by being herself. Then the Morleys unwittingly buy into a smear campaign to destroy Katie's candidacy, which causes Glenn to leave the party and fight to clear her name.Loretta Young plays the naive but wonderfully wise Katie, and it earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. Amazingly, 1947 was also the year she appeared in The Bishop's Wife, another great classic. Joseph Cotton plays the good-hearted Glenn, who was captain of Yale's greatest hockey team and is now following in his father's footsteps as Senator. Ethel Barrymore is Glenn's world-wise mother, Agatha, the family matriarch, who spots character in Katie and isn't above making side bets with the family butler, Joseph. Charles Bickford is memorable as Joseph, for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Lex Barker (Tarzan), Keith Andes (Clash By Night) and James Arness (Gunsmoke) play Katie's strapping brothers, who are terrific in a knock-down, drag-out fight with the bad guys.Director H. C. Potter's filmmaking career lasted for little more than ten years; but he is distinguished for not only this film but also Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), with Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. (Lex Barker is in that film as well.) The Farmer's Daughter was a play by Hella Wuolijoki (Juhni Tervataa), that was adapted for the screen by Allen Rivkin and Laura Kerr. The dialogue is snappy and witty, and the situations fun. It was later turned into a TV show that was entertaining but lost a great deal in translation.The Farmer's Daughter is smartly insightful. It shows that when We the People are honest, it makes honest politicians possible; but when We the People are corrupt, so are our politicians. Katie, an honest politician, was able to rise to the surface because the people around her were basically honest. That is a great lesson to us in this year of dishonest and disappointing politics.Waitsel Smith",The Farmer's Daughter 1947  VHS

987972,"In my opinion, the original ""Final Destination"" was one of the best horror films to surface in the wave of post-""Scream"" horror films that emerged in the late 1990's. The idea of a group of teenagers ""cheating death"" and then having ""death"" come back to collect them was a great one and with all of the elaborate death sequences, it was extremely well executed (excuse the pun) too. Evidently, I wasn't the only person out there who thought this, because ""Final Destination 3"" is essentially just a remake of the first ""Final Destination"" and why would you remake something if the idea didn't have merit to begin with? Of course, since ""Final Destination 3"" is just a remake, why bother to watch it at all; why not just re-watch ""Final Destination""? The answer to that question depends on why you liked the first film to begin with.If you are looking for originality of plot, then don't bother with ""Final Destination 3"". It's not there. This film will just give you a 89 minute feeling of deja vu. However, if you want to see yet another series of gruesome and elaborate death sequences, then you've come to the right place. The death sequences in this instalment are even better than those in the previous two films, and in spite of myself, I found myself eagerly anticipating each new death. Guessing who would be the next victim and how they would die was fun and the 89 minutes of the film literally just vanished, I was so engrossed in it (something which I can't say about many films). I won't give away the details of any of the deaths, since that would spoil the fun, but if that's why you like this series, then you will definitely enjoy this film.",N/A

To help Holly deal with her grief, Gerry arranges for a series of special gifts and letters to be delivered to Holly after his death. With the help of her family and a few girlfriends, Holly begin to lift herself out of her depression and embrace the chapters of her life that have yet to come.This is a sweet story that's romantic and incredibly bittersweet. The movie includes many flashbacks that depict the life Holly and Gerry shared together, which are touching and allow the audience to connect with Holly and feel her pain. There are also several beautiful sequences shot in Ireland and a strong group of supporting cast members. Obviously, so much of the film's events are incredibly unrealistic, and I also didn't care at all for Holly's relationship with the oddball David (Harry Connick, Jr.), but fortunately the film resolved that subplot very well toward the end of the film.

721686,"There are two issues in this movie.  The first is of a couple of little girls growing up with a mentally ill mother.  Angela, in her immaturity, feels at least a bit responsible for her mother's situation.  She wants to be especially good, feeling that it is her 'badness' that keeps her mother sick.  This is very common.  One girl our family has grown to love as one of our own daughters understood that it was after her mother got pregnant with her the schizophrenia manifested itself in her mother.  So, when she was little, she felt she caused it to happen.Angela has some idea of God and satan, Heaven and hell, but it is as a ten-year-old might have understood it.  It would have been nice to see where she had gotten such ideas.  Still, Angela wants very much to be a good person, and keep her little sister, Ellie, good.  However, she is still a little girl.  Parents could show this film to their own children, watching together, and use it to discuss the family beliefs regarding these topics.  It is a movie one won't soon forget, and one that will leave you thinking about it for some time after seeing it.This is a very intense movie (and there is one rather explicit sex scene).  Still, my nine-year-old granddaughter handled it very well (we fast-forwarded through the short sex scene).  I presented the story to her as one example of what might cause some kids to act in ways that her 'in group' does not think is 'cool.'  We had a good discussion about how she should treat such kids because the ones she may meet might be going through the same type of thing, though the specifics may be different, as Angela in their home.  If a parent knows their child is dealing with such a friend, this movie would be a great way to help them open up about how they feel about the 'strange' kid, and for parents to teach understanding and even compassion for him or her.

1141731,"As most reviews have described the plot/premise of this film I won't do it here or frankly waste my time. Daniel Waters assembled what appears to be a promising and very talented cast. He under-utilized them all. The movie's opening scene starts with Mindy Cohen (""Fact of Life"") who was so nice to see after such a long absence. Of course, my smile turned to ""depression"" as I thought, ""Oh my... Mindy looks old!""  LOL That sums up my reaction to this film. I wanted to smile, immerse myself in the film, but in a flash that feeling would disappear.This disjointed movie trys to be too many things on too many levels. Serious, funny, fantasy, dark, and ironic- it falls short on all topics. All the actors simply appear to meandering their parts. The movie is simply too muted in ambiance to be outstanding in any one aspect. The director should have either decided to rev up Winona's plot and morphed it into a suspense movie or taken the 180 degree turn and created a full-fledged comedy. I believe it would have worked better that way. Even the scenes I thought ""This is funny and I should be laughing,"" I could barely crack a smile.

The ""1+2=3"" aspect of that just didn't work for me or give me a complete understanding as to ""How did this happen?"". When I find myself clock-watching a film within the first half hour, I know it's in trouble. Mr. Waters didn't give me any vested interest in the characters or what their ultimate fates would be. The movie just didn't find an ""identity"" for me that I could attach to and enjoy it from there. Every once in awhile it would have a brief spark of brillence, but like a straw fire, it was gone in a instant.

497048,"""Convoy,"" the 1978 action trucker flick, is one of those movies you like but are afraid to admit to. It's the kind of tape you hide in the closet when friends are over. I first saw this crash epic at the theater as a kid and sat through it a second time because I liked it so much. Time has only slightly worn down my admiration, but in terms of the trucker genre, it's still the best.Ah, the 1970s, those days of CB handles,Smokey and the Bandit - Special Edition,White Line FeverandBreaker, Breaker. Can you believe we flocked to the theater in droves to see these films? ""Convoy"" came out at the tail end of this pedal-to-the-metal hoopla, about the time the song ""Movin' On"" was included on the B-side of all of those K-tel LPs. The film's director was the one and only Sam Peckinpah, now closing in on the end of a turbulent career. He was suffering from addictions and barely functioning as a professional. Yet even through the haze of alcohol andThe Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)dreams, shreds of his wonderful talent can be seen. It's ironic that a film considered the worst of his career is the best of a genre (fans of Jonathan Demme's fineCitizens Bandmay disagree).""Convoy"" is a muscle epic, with a genuine attempt at portraying the gritty lifestyle of truckers. I like Kris Kristofferson in the lead role, a brooding presence who makes a fine hero. I have always had problems with trucker films because the actors never really seemed appropriate for their roles (with the exception of Jerry Reed, of course). Kris is just right, exuding a sort of blue collar charisma that fits the role like faded jeans and a dirty red bandanna. The supporting cast is unusually excellent, including Ernest Borgnine in fine villainous form, Burt Young, Franklyn Ajaye and Madge Sinclair as salt-of-the-earth truckers, and even a distracted Ali MacGraw jogging around in bell bottoms and mini-fro.The movie, based on the kitschy hit song by C.W. McCallC.W. McCall - Greatest Hits, is about a trucker who runs afoul of a surly cop and then forms a convoy of trucks to escape corruption, jail, whatever. There's a few subplots, including a governor who wishes to tout trucker rights, a jailbreak somewhere in Texas and eventually a standoff with the National Guard on the Mexican border. It all sounds like a Marty Robbins' song.The cinematography by Harry Stradling Jr. is extraordinary, taking full advantage of the on-location vistas of New Mexico and Arizona. There's also a barroom fight and a car crash that must rank as the finest ever put on film. And you even have salty lines of dialog straight from the cynical pen of Peckinpah - ""Mann Act's for 18 year olds, not someone who's seen the better side of thirty!"" Or my favorite, when Kristofferson is asked what's the purpose of a convoy, ""Purpose of a convoy is to keep movin'.""Poor Sam, in the throes of alcoholism, struggled mightily during the making of this movie, and it still performed well at the box office. Never-the-less, his career was in ruins after ""Convoy."" He would make one more film before riding off into the western sunset. Not many people involved with ""Convoy"" are fond of it due to the problems during production. But what a party it must have been.If you squint your eyes just right and laugh at its absurdity, the wind-blown pages of this mediocre screenplay possess poetry of haunted men chasing ghosts down highways of the American southwest. ""Convoy"" is an example of A-list talent tackling C-list material, the end result being a unique film that raises the level of a crude genre.",Convoy [VHS]

They also have a segment from Blue Peter in which they make a Dalek cake, a Dalek sandwich, and a Dalek chocolate.

I don't understand the complaints on the movement/stabilization needed... I thought the effect of the movie being filmed on video camera added to the terrifying feeling trying to be captured.. what these people are going through during something horrible. I admit that I am not a fan of Blair Witch and was hesitant about the way this was filmed at first (before seeing it), but I thought with this movie it absolutely worked. The movie was not over done at all. The characters are great, and JJ Abrams (creator of LOST) is wonderful as always. The hidden meanings are always fun to figure out.

1090753,"**1/2""Civic Duty"" is like ""Rear Window"" for the post-9/11 age.  Terry Allen is a recently laid-off accountant who, thanks in large part to the influence of an ubiquitous, sensationalistic news media, has become increasingly obsessed with the ""terrorist threat"" hanging over the Western world.  When a young Middle Eastern man moves into an apartment across the way, Terry immediately goes into surveillance mode, spying on his every move, following him around town, breaking into his home, and even reporting him to what Terry quickly learns, much to his dismay, is a decidedly uninterested and unconcerned FBI.  Soon, his life and marriage are falling apart as he plunges ever deeper into his paranoia-driven madness.""Civic Duty"" starts off as a reasonably compelling psychological thriller, but the longer the movie goes on the more farfetched and heavy-handed it becomes.  Peter Krause, who was so subtle and effective as the star of ""Six Feet Under,"" is forced to go so over-the-top in his performance here that we begin to fear he'll burst a blood vessel long before the movie is over.  The underlining doesn`t stop there, however, for  Jeff Renfroe""s direction is filled with any number of hokey touches, including panning wildly or having the camera do virtual somersaults anytime anything even remotely sinister or suspenseful is about to take place on screen.The movie first points out how the media, obsessed with profits and ratings, finds it necessary to bombard us with a steady stream of potential terror threats, both real and manufactured, on an around-the-clock basis - and then questions what kind of effect such sensory overload might have on an already unstable personality.  And, beyond that, might the media and the political class it serves be turning all of us, to some degree or another, into raging paranoiacs, ready to pry into our neighbors` private business in the cause of national security?  Unfortunately, this provocative theme gets buried under a truckload of paranoid-thriller cliches.Kari Matchett, Khaled Abol Naga and Richard Schiff (""The West Wing"") do well in their various roles, but the movie, well intentioned though it is, falls far short of its potential.",Civic Duty

1142257,"I have a confession to make: I'm new to the gravity-defying martial arts genre. I've never seen ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"" or ""Fearless"" or any of the old standards starring Bruce Lee. Heck, I've never even seen anything starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li. So it's quite possible that I'm ill suited to review ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" a movie that blends martial arts with family-friendly comedy and lots of cool special effects. I will say that the film generally achieved what it wanted to achieve, and I was certainly entertained all throughout. I'll also say that the story is a watered-down retread of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" about as light and airy as a flying Kung Fu master. But I guess story isn't important here; it's all about choreographed action sequences and how many can be crammed into place.The film is book-ended by present day sequences taking place in Boston, where young Jason Tripitikas (Michael Angarano) lives for Hong Kong martial arts movies. That's essentially all we know about him, which is kind of annoying. The best we're given in terms of development is that he lives with his (unseen) mother and never knew whom his father was. Be that as it may, the film begins with Jason visiting a thrift store owned by Old Hop (Chan), a man who looks about as ancient as China itself. After looking through a stash of bootlegged Asian DVDs, Jason wanders into a back room and notices an ornate golden staff, which, according to Hop, was in the store when his grandfather opened it 100 years ago. Apparently, someone special will one day enter the store and reclaim the staff.After Jason leaves, he's bullied by a group of thugs into getting them into Hop's store. Their robbery attempt goes wrong, and Jason grabs the staff before being chased to the roof; the thugs don't have a chance to kill him because the staff magically transports him to Ancient China, where he wakes up dressed as a monk. He walks around in confusion, not knowing where he is or how he got there, and what's worse, he doesn't speak any of the Chinese dialect everyone else is speaking. That problem is conveniently solved as soon as he meets Lu Yan (also played by Chan), who saves Jason from a group of warriors trying to take the staff: when Jason says, ""I can't understand what you're saying,"" Lu replies in English, ""That's because you're not listening!"" From then on, absolutely everyone is able to speak fluent English.Lu--a drunken immortal who downs jug after jug of wine (supposedly an elixir)--tells Jason of an old prophecy: a traveler will deliver the staff to the Monkey King (Jet Li), a mischievous immortal who sent it away when another immortal--the warlord of the evil Jade Army (Collin Chou)--challenged him to a duel and deceived him. As protection, the Monkey King encased himself in stone over 500 years earlier, and it's there that he awaits the return of his staff. The only one who can free him is Jason, but in order for that to happen, he must learn the ways of Kung Fu. Only when he accomplishes his given task can he return to his own time and place.They soon meet Golden Sparrow (Liu Ye Fei), an orphaned young woman who refers to herself in the third person and has a vendetta against the Jade Warlord. They also meet the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Li), who has apparently been seeking the seeker for quite some time. As they all travel across China to the fabled Five Elements Mountain, both the Lu and the Silent Monk take it upon themselves to teach Jason the art of Kung Fu, which will be a long and arduous process. Unfortunately, the Jade Warlord has learned of their plans and sends a bounty hunter to retrieve the staff; here enters Ni-Chang (Li Bing Bing), a nimble assassin who's deadly with a whip and even deadlier with her long, white hair. Should she succeed, the Jade Warlord has promised her a powerful elixir that can bestow immortality.I've been describing the specifics of the story, but make no mistake--""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is all about the fight scenes, which are initially spread evenly but become wall-to-wall by the time we reach the climactic final battle. Each fight is beautifully choreographed and a lot of fun to watch, so much so that the story felt more like an afterthought. The same can be said for the sense of humor, which is certainly not necessary despite being a pleasant distraction. I obviously can't say that martial arts films are supposed to work this way, since this is the first one I've ever seen.Still, I have a feeling that director Rob Minkoff was intentionally aiming for something less substantive and more entertaining, which in this case is not a criticism; at times, we actively seek escapist films like ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" and I think Minkoff knew that all along. But as I said at the beginning, I may be out of my league here. As someone who has never experienced the visual splendors of a martial arts film, I don't know if ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is better or worse than anything that came before it. Then again, comparisons are rarely useful for reviewing a movie--one should judge it on its own terms. On that note, I'll say that ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is good-looking movie with lots of enjoyable stunts and an insubstantial story. That's pretty much what I expected going into it, so I have to give credit where credit is due.",The Forbidden Kingdom

366021,"Perhaps due to the recent success of the remake of this short story by Elmore Leonard, this re-issue of the '57 classic western starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin was released. For students of screenwriting both versions offer an important lesson in the ""less is more"" axiom.  The original was a taut, short (barely over 90 minutes) tale that concentrated on its 2 main characters whereas the recent remake offers too many characters and subplots that makes this remake not as appealing as the original did. Also the characterizations of the 2 characters are quite different from the original.  Whereas Ford is shown as a bad guy who only draws when confronted, Crowe in the same role, is a Bible quoting psychotic who will shoot on mere provocation when crossed.  Also the farmer character as played by Heflin is now a disabled Civil war veteran who is burdened by marital problems with his wife. Also the ending has been drastically changed in the remake and a very unsatisfactory, nonsensical one at that!!  I've been taken to task for my criticism of the remake but I will hold steadfast to my opinion that if you build up sympathy for a character in a film--you don't kill him off unless there is a plausible reason for it which the remake did not have.  So do see this classic Western, because you'll finally appreciate what a fine under-rated actor Ford was in comparison to Russell Crowe.",3:10 to Yuma VHS

730835,"The performances are first rate:  Glenda Jackson certainly deserved her Oscar, Alan Bates is always wonderful and Oliver Reed captures your heart by his very presence.  The story is filled with the personal obsessions that drove Lawrence--finding some sort of truth in physical passion being the most obvious one.  This film adaptation is hardly subtle--driving the same ideas home again and again---starting with the lesson of the parts of the flower in the opening schoolroom scene.  Then there's the famous picnic scene where Alan Bates likens the fig to a woman's sexual part. Then there are all of explicit love scenes, including the nude male wrestling by the firelight scene between Bates and Reed.I guess all of this was pretty hot stuff when the film was made, but it strikes me as almost silly at this point in time.  Likewise the dialogue, discussing over and over the nature of love stikes me as way overly ponderous. Especially because no one solved any of their problems that way.  I guess that's one of Lawrence's demons--over intellectualizing and then trying to compensate by some sort of physical activity, mainly sex.  I'm sure many others have analyzed Lawrence's psyche endlessly so I won't bother, here, except to mention that the incredibly creepy mother of the Reed character certainly bears attention.The cinematography is great, the costumes are good, the English countryside and shots in Zermatt are beautiful.  There's a lot of entertainment value in the film if you don't take it too seriously.  Ken Russell did, and obviously most of the readers here did too.",N/A
1127016,"AWAKE would be better named 'audience wake up' as the minimal novel idea of the story loses credibility so quickly that the development of the subplots become increasingly tedious and silly.  Joby Harold both wrote and directed this film and despite the presence of some fine actors, the film remains grounded.Clay Beresford (Hayden Christensen) has inherited his dead father's multi-billion dollar fortune and shares the wealth and control of his empire with his domineering mother Lilith (Lena Olin). Clay apparently has a genetically determined cardiac pathology, is medicated, and awaits a heart transplant. The only semblance of honest life Clay has is his love for his mother's secretary Sam (Jessica Alba) who, despite Lilith's objections, marries Clay after disclosing their relationship.  Clay's beeper warning that a cardiac donor is available cuts short their night of honeymoon and Clay is rushed to the hospital to his constant friend, Dr. Jack Harper (Terrence Howard), who just happens to be a heart transplant surgeon and who Clay prefers over Dr. Neyer (Arliss Howard),  the superior cardiac surgeon friend of his mother who has been the designated surgeon all along. The gimmick of the film is 'anesthetic awareness', a state of anesthesia when the patient is paralyzed but aware of the talk in the OR as well as the pain of the surgery. What Clay hears 'under anesthesia is a ridiculous, convoluted plot involving all the people he thought he could trust and about which he can do nothing: in order to keep the storyline rolling, the script gives him an out of body experience so that Clay can be his own detective in solving the myriad discrepancies of his situation.  The ending is very predicable and begs viewer indulgence.Perhaps the credibility of this story would have been better if the director and actors had paid more attention to OR technique: walking into an OR in street clothes, handling patients without gloves or masks, allowing outsiders to enter the OR during a transplant procedure, beginning surgery without documentation of complete anesthesia or before the donor heart arrives, etc. etc. etc. are such breaches of surgical rules that even the casual viewer of TV medical dramas knows.  But the real problem with the script is that we are left caring very little for any of the characters, despite the fact the roles are assigned to some heavy hitters! Sadly, the movie is just silly.

1098300,"Little Anna is stuck in the middle between conservative bourgeoise grandparents, Catholic school friends and teachers, and her increasingly radicalized parents in 1970's Paris, and she doesn't like it one little bit.Centered on an astonishing portrayal by young Nina Kervel-Bey, her defiant Anna with her pugnacious chin jutting-out fearlessly faces the various forces swirling around her with justifiable frustration and anger at the upset and turmoil created in her young life by neglectful parents caught up in their leftist political passions and the likewise estrangement from the conervative foundations of her previously privileged life. Her spirit is undiminished however as she faces them all down with wit and preternatural common sense, asking the difficult question and demanding attention and respect.  This little girl is wonderfully expressive and impressive and Gravas has elicited a marvelous performance from her.While I assume Gravas sympathies probably lie with the politics of the parents, she is very even-handed in her depiction of all sides and is never polemical but instead finds the humanity in all.  Being the daughter of a famously political director herself, she must have brought great understanding to the confusion and anger of a young child who could care less about politics but experiences only absent and distracted parents and a comfortable life overthrown for passions and principles she does not understand and is very perceptive in pricking the pretensions of while revealing the confusion in the adults around her.A very fine film, well acted by all, but little Nina is the whole show and for one so small and lovely to dominate and carry a film of this depth with such ferocious confidence and humor is a tribute to the wee actor and her director and is well worth anyone's time.",Blame It on Fidel

1155323,"There are obvious paralles between Derek Jarman and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Both were prodigys and both were homosexuals who struggled to make sense of themselves in a world that either did not acknowledge that homosexual culture existed or vilified it. And both were iconoclasts in their respective mediums who were nonetheless obsessed with religious themes and reading their own lives within the context of traditional culture. But there the parallels end for temperamentally the two are absolutely incommensurable. Wittgenstein is a humorously irreverent child prodigy but a humorless adult. Lucky for us Jarman keeps the child version of Ludwig around as a kind of ludic spirit to lighten the gloomy load that is always weighing on the adult Ludwig's joyless mind. Cleverly, Jarman has everyone except the joyless adult Ludwig wear primary colors and act as if nothing at all weighed on their clever Cambridge minds.The primary relationships and philosophic pursuits of Ludwig's life are briefly explained and explored. The Cambridge set ( represented here by philosopher Bertrand Russell, gay economist John Maynard Keynes, and haughty Bloomsbury socialite Lady Ottoline) are drawn to the Viennese genius and enjoy having him around even though he is for all intents and purposes socially dysfunctional. In fact this philosopher of language is such a poor communicator that he makes a disasterously poor professor. When Bertrand tells Ludwig that his students imitate his behavior it seems ambiguous as to whether Russell means that they mock Wittgenstein's  aristocratic and effette mannerisms or affectionately appropriate them. Its also not clear if this means that Ludwig has made it fashionable to be gay at Cambridge. All of these meanings seem to be suggested but the latter one seems to be the one that Jarman wants to stress without spelling it out (this was made for BBC television after all). It is clear that Jarman is interested in telling gay history here and as such Ludwig would fit into the gay-man-who-cannot-accept-himself-as-gay-man subject position which is doubly sad since the young Ludwig was so proudly and fearlessly anti-normal. As a result of this self-loathing all of Ludwig's relationships (including his relationship with philosophy) are of the love/hate variety. Jarman makes it clear that it was his ascetic nature, his love of clarity and purity, that made him such a groundbreaking philosopher; and he also makes it clear that it was this love of purity that made his self-hatred all the more intense. But, again, Jarman keeps things light. One never feels the heaviness of the actual life as Wittgenstein himself must have felt it. You can judge for yourself whether this is an achievment or an evasion.In addition to the tragic nature of Wittgenstein's personal story, Jarman is also interested in drawing parallels between the fin de sielce zeitgeist of Ludwig's suicide rampant Vienna and the fin de siecle zeitgeist of his own AIDS rampant London. These contextual parallels would probably have been more fully explored had this been a full blown feature film and not simply a one-hour made for BBC production. As a result this is more like an appetizer than a full meal. But, given the scarcity of Jarman projects, it is savored for what it is.Ideally, I think Foucault (who was as playful as Jarman when it came to dissecting the systems that order us about) would have been a better match for this director. But its an oddly appealing film nonetheless.Ironically, Wittgenstein is known for enabling us to see language as a game not with a singular set of rules but with as many sets of rules as there are speech communities. This breakthrough proved to be liberating for many artists and thinkers (Foucault among them who has shed much light on the way discourses shape identity) that followed in his wake, but Wittgenstein himself (tied as he was to the dominant discourse of conventional morality) never seemes to have experienced this breakthrough as liberatory.",N/A

659958,"I had really been looking forwards to this film, while I enjoyed Batman Begins, I found that there were problems with it, which I had  thought would be remedied with this film. Coupled with the hype sorounding The Dark Knight I thought that I would be in for a treat.Instead I was tremendously disappointed.The Dark Knight  is more like a glorified episode of `The Sheild' or `The Wire', in which a cops and lawyers try to apprehend a psychopath. The movie is more about Gordon, Dent and The Joker than it is about Batman. In fact Batman is hardly in the film at all, and when he is featured there is no depth to his appearance or performance.  In fact if Batman had been taken out of it, or his part replaced with a maverick cop or private eye the film would have not been changed. Batman being in the film had no consequence to the film.  In retrospect the film really should have been called `The Joker' because the film  is more about him than anyone else.Here are some of the problems I had with the film.*In Batman Begins, Bruce said that he traveled the world to understand the criminal mind. Are we supposed to believe that he never came across a psychopath during his travels? I also guess that in the Nolan Batverse we are to believe that Stalin and Hitler and other such monsters never existed. Which is why it explains his complete surprise that someone like the Joker could exist, and his inability to get a handle him.* Batman is supposed to be well versed in the martial arts which above all  else instills discipline and focus. Yet he allows the Joker to needlessly provoke him into loosing his temper, wasting precious time while his  two friends are in mortal danger.* Batman has been on the job at most a year, yet he is able to order the Gotham City Police Department to do his bidding. I almost choked when I saw him lecture a cop about not contaminating the crime scene.*The Jokers' success in the film is contingent on most of the characters behaving stupidly and having no common sense.* In Batman Begins, Bruce was committed to being Batman, now in the TDK he wants to throw in the towel and quit at the first sign of trouble.  I would have thought that Batman would have a stronger spine.* Bruce deciding that he can give up being Batman because he now has Dent to take his place. How can that be the case when he and Dent do two completely different jobs? Batman is a vigilante who helps to apprehend criminals. Dent is a prosecutor who tries criminals, he does nothing to apprehend criminals he has to rely on the cops to do that.* Bruce saying that Dent is his successor despite the fact that Dent already had a bad reputation to begin with. Wasn't Batman supposed to have done research?* Dent's speech at dinner about Batman wanting to give up being Batman someday. How is Dent supposed to have come by this information?* Dent's sudden transformation to Two Face, because of the death of his girlfriend.*If the Joker is hell bent on confusion and destruction and human misery, why is he taking the time to explain to Dent that he had nothing to do with the death of his girlfriend?* The whole scene with the ferry. The notion of a group willing to sacrifice themselves until death for another group of people is unrealistic. Self-preservation is the number one rule of all human beings. Also if people are as self-sacrificing and nice as Nolan wants to suggest in that scene. Then what do they need Batman for?*Two Face whining about the what's fair, yet trying to justify trying to kill Gordon's family.* The notion that Batman is setting himself up as a sacrificial lamb at the end of the film because 'that's what the people' need is a lame attempt to draw an equation between Batman and Jesus Christ. It was extremely tacky and contrived. Nowhere is it written in any of the Batman books that Batman's  intent is to take the punishment for the people.*The Hong Kong scene was stupid and pointless, as was the useless car chase.And of course the self-important, pseudo intellectual verbiage that piled out of every characters mouth, No one spoke in this film. They just gave grandiose speeches. I just found it hard to take seriouslyThis is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life.  Clearly Nolan has no understanding or respect for Batman.",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

1130639,"A lot of romantic comedies follow an incredibly rigid formula. Guy will meet girl and they fall in love but guy does something stupid which breaks it up and while both are trying to move on, guy decides to do something embarassing/public which will win her heart. However occasionally a film will come along that at least plays with the conventions but either doesn't do it sufficiently enough or some story things just feel wrong for the tone. Dan in Real Life is that kind of film where it doesn't deal with romance in a way-too-common manner but what it does with it doesn't work either.Dan Burns is an advice columnist and single dad to 3 daughters after their mom died four years ago. Travelling to family reunion, Dan meets Anne-Marie, a charming woman that Dan almost instantly connects with and is excited at its prospects. Upon returning back to the house he gets a surprise when his brother Mitch is in a relationship with none other than Marie and the family is more than ecstatic with the pairing. With her always around and his own family on the rocks, Dan has to hide his feelings even when Marie shows signs she cares for him as well.I can very much relate with Dan since on more than one occasion I've had feelings for a woman that unfortunately is unavailable (and strangely involved with the poorest excuse for a guy in town) but I never had a family that seems so nasty as this one. Scheduling a blind date with a girl they remember having a slight ""pig-like"" face, the family proceeds to crack jokes and even sing a song that seems more demeaning and teasing than a family affair. Even though it's a romantic comedy, the family seems almost intentionally mean at times and it's almost depressing to watch considering what Dan has to be around.Plus the dynamic between Dan and Marie (helped by the good chemistry they have) doesn't seem to go beyond that bookstore meaning and whereas Mitch is clearly not the right guy, going as far as to use pre-written lines - by Dan, of course - Dan and Marie have one big bonding scene where they can get along before the world crashes down around him and he spends a good time skulking. But at least the acting is generally solid all around, including the actresses who play Dan's daughters while Dane Cook is probably his least irritating though he seems like he's just playing a tamer version of other roles he's played or even a tamer Dane Cook.I would recommend watching the film since it's at least different than those Matthew McConaughey/Kate Hudson-type rom-coms but on the other hand, I appreciate Dan in Real Life for what it wanted to do but I can't based on what it did.",N/A
1124091,"When I first heard about silk I was not that keen about seeing it but for my Birthday my grandmother had no idea I was not so keen and bought it as a gift. I am so glad that I did not return it! Silk is a visual masterpiece about a mayors son named Herve who falls in love with a beautiful young women named helene. Every thing seems like It's going to be picture perfect about that time a man named Baldabiou has ideas of opening the run-down silk mill the only problem is there is a disease killing all the silk eggs in france and without the eggs there can be no silk mill. Baldabiou approaches Herve and tells him about going to Africa to retrive the eggs Herve accepts. Helene does not want Herve to leave there are recently married but she does not want to be a burden. After succesfully retriving the eggs Herve must go on another journey to japan. Some of the eggs are dead and Baldabiou sees that as a very bad sign. Leaving his wife again he sets out on a tough journey and falls in love with the mistress of a powerful japanese baron. Herve ends up going again and becoming more obsessed with her and at one point after finding a note saying ""come back or I shall die"". while Helene is at home lonely and waiting for Herve ( How sad!)Pros: Silk is very beautiful visualy! great cineamatography. Lovely Costumes. And a beautiful score that should have won an oscar. Another Great thing about the film was Keira Knightley as Helene. She was so beautiful in her costumes and her performance was very touching and very subtle yet heart breaking!Cons: Michael Pitt is not as good Keira Knightley and pouts and tries to act cute. Other then that.....................................Rating: 8.5/10 Silk is a love story about a man who forget the love of his life was always been near and not far. It's beautiful to watch but Michael pitt almost makes it less than great But Keira Knightley makes up for that she was awesome!",Silk
1079495,"In this forum, I gave the first two Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collections five stars each because I was ecstatic to have the classic shorts in a handy form for on-demand viewing. Many reviewers were slamming the occasional minor edits, but I tried to see the forest for the trees. I'm an enthusiastic fan but not really a passionate collector, so I don't get too upset about little edits by the current DVD producers, regardless of the wisdom behind their decisions. But this time I'm siding with the critics because Time Warner has no idea what it's doing. First of all, Spotlight Collection #3 has simpler packaging and fewer bonus features than its predecessors, indicating a lack of consistency and enthusiasm from Time Warner. Most importantly, the two completely deleted episodes are a travesty, because the back of this box says that #3 ""is the final release of the William Hanna and Joseph Barbera Era Theatrical Shorts on DVD."" So Time Warner has decided that we won't get two episodes. Yes, the issue is those crude old racial stereotypes, which I (and everyone else) know are wrong. But Time Warner has handled the issue disastrously.As a kid in the 1970s I watched the Tom & Jerry classics with my mother and grandmother, who could recall watching the originals back in the 40s and 50s. Very early on they informed me that those nasty racial caricatures were ignorant, and I never gave those stereotypes any consideration while enjoying the artistry and hilarity of the classic cartoons. Therefore it is not necessary for Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Turner to tell me what to think of them three decades later. Anyone stupid enough to convert old stereotypes into modern bigotry is not in the market demographic for these DVDs. Time Warner should know who their customers are - collectors and serious fans who desire historical completeness and who know that the racial caricatures should be disregarded. We do not need Time Warner to tell us what's right or wrong because we already know. This is especially pathetic when compared to the standard sex, violence, and bowdlerization that appear all over Time Warner's modern programming, and that stuff is even being done to people rather than animated animals.Granted, there are still plenty of classics in this package and fans will love watching them again and again. For that reason Spotlight Collection #3 gets two stars. But Time Warner is guilty of incompetent business practices when it creates a collector-oriented product, but forgets about those enthusiastic customers while trying to appease moralists who wouldn't even think of buying the product in the first place. The jeers are deserved. [~doomsdayer520~]",Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection: Vol. 3
1023375,"Most comic fans I've met in the last couple of years really like this new movie vision of ""Superman"" -- and that's high praise because comic fans, like myself, are a pretty skeptical lot when it comes to our beloved heroic icons.But there's an important aspect to this particular film version that keeps cropping up in discussions, because I'm a journalist who specializes in reporting on the impact of spirituality in people's lives. Over and over again, people tell me that this movie made them think about their faith and their values concerning social responsibility. That's remarkable for a heavy-duty action flick loaded with special effects.There are thousands of small-discussion groups in congregations across the U.S. looking for ways to kick start their conversations. I'd strongly suggest that groups think of watching this film together and talking about the issues it raises.

1083688,"This DVD is taken from the WGBM production directed by Ilan Ziv.  It is admirably objective considering that Ziv was born in Israel and fought in the Yom Kippur War of 1973.  He came to the US and graduated from New York University's film school soon afterwards.The film consists of interviews with soldiers and politicians from both the Arab and Israeli side along with footage shot during the war.  I say the film is ""admirably objective"" but of course there is no such thing as absolute objectivity in such matters, and I am sure that Arab viewers will find the production disagreeable.  This disagreement may stem largely from the fact that the Six Day War in June, 1967 was an unmitigated disaster for Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and especially for Palestine.However, Israel's swift and decisive victory brought with it no lasting peace.  It did however humiliate the Arabs who imagined that they should be able to defeat such a tiny nation as Israel with Allah on their side and great leadership from Egypt's charismatic President Gamal Adbel Nassar and Jordan's King Hussein.  To save face Arab leaders have done two things.  One, they have inculcated the faithful with the notion that Israel won only because the US and other allies helped them; and Two, they have refused to acknowledge defeat holding onto the notion that the war is not over and that the Arab nations will yet achieve victory.Ziv's film emphasizes the political nature of the conflict, revealing the thinking of leaders on both sides, showing how Moshe Dayan assumed a position of power and influence just prior to the war and how Nassar deluded himself (or was deluded by his military people) into thinking the combined forces of Egypt, Syria and Jordan could defeat the Israelis.  In the United States President Lyndon Johnson was advised by his military people that if the Israelis struck first they would win in a week or so, if second, it would take them perhaps two weeks.  Johnson remarked (at the time mired in Vietnam) that his generals did a great job of analyzing prospective wars in which they would not be involved, or words to that effect.Ziv reminds the viewer that the war could have escalated into a much wider conflict, possibly bringing in the Soviet Union on the side of the Arabs and the US on the side of Israel.  Some teletype messages between Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin and Johnson are recalled.Some facts gleaned from the film:Israel struck first with well-timed, precision bombing of Arab airfields so that the Arab states were left with no air power.  The war was, effectively speaking, over then within hours of its start.  However, when the report of the air disaster reached Nassar, instead of seeking peace as fast as possible, he ordered propaganda broadcasts replete with fictitious ""victories.""  Black and white film clips show the Arabs in jubilant celebration.  How cruel it was when the truth came a few days later.Israeli's preemptive first strike was prompted by the military build up by Egypt and Nassar's closing of the Strait of Hormuz, which most authorities consider an act of war.  The film strongly suggests that if Israel had not acted first it would have suffered many more casualties, especially from Arab air power.And then there is the famous phone call from the Arab states that never came.  The Israelis were willing to trade land for peace, but the Arabs decided to pretend that the war would continue and so they did not negotiate a peace treaty.  The actual fighting ended because the super powers and the United Nations demanded that Israel halt its advances.There is some almost nostalgic footage of Moshe Dayan, Israeli's heroic Defense Minister who led the armed forces to victory, and some of indecisive Prime Minister Levi Eshkol.  Ziv recreates the story of their difference of opinion on what Israel should do and how Dayan's position prevailed.The real losers in the war have turned out to be the Palestinian people who have been under occupation since the war ended.  The Arab states that were instrumental in bringing about this human tragedy seem content to blame Israel while doing nothing substantive to help the Palestinians.  Indeed a significant portion of the terrorism directed at Israel and the West is motivated by spiteful spasms of revenge by Arabs who are desperate to somehow erase what they see as a humiliating defeat.  How much wiser it would be to realize that what happened in 1967 reflects not at all on the manhood of anyone living today, or even then for that matter.  Israel won because it could not lose.  ""Manhood"" and heroic acts of valor or lack thereof have nothing to do with it.Sadly, as many others have noted, Israel may win all the battles and all the wars and yet never achieve peace.  Theirs is an unenviable position.  As long as they exist in the midst of Arab nations who hate them and teach their children to hate, they will always be on a military footing.  Only when the old hatreds die, some many years from now, will there be lasting peace in the Holy Lands.",Six Days in June

1158006,"Many things were off the hook, especially Aang's battle with Ozai. That was filled with so much pwnage.There were several things in this DVD that were one-star for me. Mind you, this is a commentary only on the episodes this DVD, not the rest of the series.- The ending with the kisses. Ruined it for me, really. There should have been no kissing, it just added kitschiness to the whole ending and felt forced.- Plot inconsistencies within the last few episodes (Ember Island Players, Southern Raiders) It feels to me that the writers simply weren't paying attention and didn't care to tighten up the plot.- Many questions left unanswered. The fate of Ursa? Long Feng? The Earth King? The White Lotus? Chit Sang? Teo? Again, it feels like the writers got sloppy. Tsk tsk...Other than that, the eps were decent. Good animation, and plot holes aside, there were humorous/memorable moments. So overall, when you add the good stuff and bad stuff, this particular set of episodes gets 3/5 stars. I really wish the writers had been more attentive and careful though.","Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 3 Fire, Vol. 4"
913378,"""Ashanti"" has loads going for it: Released in 1979, it was directed by Richard Fleischer and stars Michael Caine with an impressive supporting cast, including Peter Ustinov, Omar Shariff, William Holden and Rex Harrison (the latter three in very minor roles). If you're into exotic women there's Beverly Johnson, not to mention great exotic locations -- Israel, Kenya and Sicily (although much of the story takes place in the Sahara Desert). Caine's co-star, Kabir Bedi, is impressive as well.The story addresses modern-day slavery. Caine's black wife is apprehended by slave-traders and he chases them across the Sahara Desert all the way to the Red Sea. I know of two beautiful women who completely disappeared abroad. What happened to them? Were they apprehended by slavers? Did they become sex slaves? No one knows. The film illustrates this very-real possibility.""Ashanti"" plays like a wannabe ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but doesn't even come close. It's marred by a horribly dated 70s score whereas the score to ""Lawrence"" is timeless (even though it's older by about 17 years!!). Plus, ""Lawrence"" is believable from beginning to end, whereas I found myself mumbling ""Yeah, right"" numerous times while watching ""Ashanti."" In other words, too many scenes come off unconvincing or slightly awkward.BOTTOM LINE: ""Ashanti"" sounds great on paper but they needed to take more time in the creation process to work out the kinks in the writing, acting, directing and score.Still, the locations are great, there is a lot of action and the film provokes thought on an important subject. It's definitely worth picking up if you're a Caine fan or if you're into desert-survival flicks, especially since it's so cheap. Same thing if you favor Beverly Johnson (who's not the greatest actress). It's quite a bit better than caine's similar African adventure ""The Wilby Conspiracy"" (1975).The dvd features only a full screen version but the picture is quite good. Unfortunately the menu is cheap, featuring only ""Play Movie"" and ""Trailer;"" there isn't even a scene selection option.GRADE: C",N/A

The course that America took during George Washington's presidency is the reason why we are where we are today. John Adams is the man portrayed as the Founder caught in between Jefferson and Hamilton, the two poles of thinking as to who America should side with and invest in. Ultimately we sided with the monarchists, and it should surprise no one that we have ended up with a unitary executive like George Bush, a monarch in all but title.Had Jefferson not left America and taken over from Washington, we could have supported the French, because they were our true ideological allies.

790338,"I happened across this little gem recently for two bucks in a discount/discontinued merchandise store; and it's easy to see why it was to be found there.  ( Even at that, I think I got ripped off! )  I earnestly believe this anime title to have NO redeeming features whatsoever.  It's based on what we are told was a ""classic"" anime of the 1960's.  If that's so, then why not reissue the ORIGINAL, instead of attempting to remake something this dated?  ( Not to mention trying to ""salvage"" the ghastly character designs! )  There's something disconcertingly incongruous about the mix of modern computer animation with these horrible, flat, and dated characters.The original 1960's version is touted as an originator of the concept of ""sentai"" or a group of super-heroes fighting a common enemy; in this case the unoriginal ""Black Ghost"", whose design makes Skeletor look GOOD!  Each member of the team has his ( or her ) own super-specialty, like rockets in the feet - obviously ""borrowed"" from Astro Boy.  Sadly, all that accomplishes is to keep this at the level of a very BAD stereotypical Saturday morning kiddie show.  I found it impossible to sympathize with or even like ANY of the characters, who are all total cliches.  Even watching with the original Japanese dialog was of no help this time; I can only imagine how horrible it must be with dubbing!The plot of the evil overlord trying to take over the world with his robot henchmen ( the eponymous Cyborgs of the title ) is lame enough to begin with, but I struggled heroically throughout all 8 episodes presented here TRYING to find a single redeeming feature - all in vain.  Mercifully Columbia/Tristar pulled the plug on this turkey after releasing only this ""unedited and uncut"" set of 2 DVD's, which barely scratches the surface of this long and tedious epic.

1126900,"Sorry for the play on words but i had to get it off my chest, having said that ""The Mist"" has one quality usually missing from most scary movies-it's really scary. Is the story implausable? You betcha-but that's the point of most horror stories-set up a life threatening situation-then scare the bejeezus out of the audience. It has been years since I read the Stephen King novella and I don't remember if the cliche explanation of ""science gone awry"" was responsible for the mist and the creatures lurking inside it but the person revealing what is happening does not meet a pretty end.The movie is extremely gruesome but the most gruesome character is not one of the creatures terrorizing the trapped super-market shoppers but Marcia Gay Hardin as Mrs Carmody the town loony and religious fanatic.  Her continuous rantings about ""the end of days"" and ""Gods vengeance against sinners"" finally convinces most of the terrified shoppers-but to the directors credit, he shows his disdain for Mrs Carmody by having her talk to her Lord and saviour sitting on the john.Much has been said about the ending and I agree-it is awful but if the movie had ended with the last act of Thomas Janes' character it would have been horrifying enough but the movie goes on for a few minutes more and what happens hits you like a punch in the gut.With the exception of the ending the movie is a well made chiller and if you happen to buy the 2 disc set you can also see the movie in black and white.

358756,"Hey, you got Halloween on my Christmas! ...  Yes, it's dark Halloween chocolate wrapped around sweet Christmas peanut butter.  Or something like that.The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't your typical Christmas confection, but it is the kind of Christmas movie you might expect from Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands): macabre, sort-of-but-not-too-scary, and ultimately good-humored and good-natured.  It's also quite a feat of animation, the first feature-length stop-action film.  And it's a musical!The story takes place in a world where the magical side of each major holiday is run by a specialized, hidden holiday town, like Santa's North Pole headquarters.  One year, the restless Jack Skellington of Halloween Town discovers Christmas Town, is very impressed, and decides Halloween Town should expand its horizons and take over Christmas that year.  Unfortunately, he and the other residents of his town don't understand Christmas as well as they do Halloween, and their basically well-intentioned efforts threaten to ruin Christmas altogether.The animation is highly imaginative and particularly well suited to the Halloween connections, as we would expect from a Burton-produced project.  The songs, by Danny Elfman, are catchy and fun, partly because of twisted but good-hearted subject matter.  There are scares, adventures, a romance, lessons learned, and a good Christmassy outcome.  Most kids and adults will be delighted, though parents may wish to consider the scary stuff for very young kids who don't like being scared.The Nightmare Before Christmas is coming out in several new editions, all restored and remastered, with new special features.  Besides the Blu-ray on this page, there will also be a new 2-Disc Collector's Edition on standard DVD (here) and, for true fanatics (with the funds), a limited Ultimate Collector's Edition with a numbered, hand-painted bust of Jack Skellington with his Sandy Claws hat and beard and a sound chip that plays quotes from the movie, a letter of authenticity, a special coffin-shaped box for the bust, a booklet with the Nightmare Before Christmas poem, and an extra disc for the digital copy (not sure what the advantage of that is).

With a cast of virtual new commers, Timothy Bottoms, Cybil Sheapred, Jeff Bridges and Randy Quaid, Bagdanovich caught lightening in a jar. Then in 1973 he chose to pair father and daughter, Ryan and Tatum O'Neil to give us one of the seventies most memerable movies, Paper Moon.""The Last Picture Show"" was a glimpse into the lives of lonely and misbegotten characters, living in a down-and-out, oil-bust Texas town. They're all waiting for that last flicker of hope to shine before the camara winds down and the movie house goes dark. ""Paper Moon"" explores the incredible journey of two unlikely souls adrift in the American heartland during the depths of the great depression. The background sounds of radio broadcasts connects the viewer with the popular figures of the times. The voices of Jack Benny and Fred Allen along with the music of Ozzie Nelson, Paul Whiteman and Tommy Dorsey all remind us of the innocence of the day. The voice of ""Frankie"" Roosevelt tells us of the hard times Americans faced amid sky-high unemployment, record drought and even bank failures. As in ""The Last Picture Show"", Bagdanovich knows exactly how to integrate the background ""radio chatter"" into the scene with perfection.... ""Yes folks, let's have another cup of coffee and let's have another piece of pie"". For Addie and Moze that next cup of coffee is a sleepy little town out across a dusty corn field...and that next piece of pie is some poor, unsuspecting widow waiting with false hope and a kind heart.Easily two of my favorite movies, ""The Last Picture Show"" and ""Paper Moon"" are absolutely brilliant. Kudos to Peter Bagdanovich for such picture perfect and finely crafted motion pictures. Surely he caught lightening in a jar yet again. My only hope is that he has at least one more up his sleeve before he packs it all in. Bravo!!! and Thank you Mr. Bogdanavich!!!P.S.

365067,"Ziegfeld Follies was a movie fraught with so many delays,shooting schedule work arounds,cancellations,scene deletions,etc.,that this picture is one of very few to finally be released so long after its' original production had stopped.A few pre-release screenings were done in 1944 and 1945 but the film got such a tepid response it was returned to have more work done on it.The studio got the jitters and finally shelved it.Fred Astaire personally wrote the production chief Arthur Freed wondering when the film would be released;he was very anxious to say the least.He told him it was the first time he had made a film that would be seemingly released so long a time afterwards or at all.Freed assured Fred that Ziegfeld Follies would be released in 1946 and not to worry.The film was copyrighted in 1946 but wasn't released nationwide until January 11,1948!One of the other reasons Astaire was worried was that he felt his routines might get dated.He needn't have worried for the routines Fred appears in(there are three;technically four if you count his brief opener)are the highlights of this film.In fact after William Powell opens the movie reprising his /36 role as the show master himself,Florence Ziegfeld,Fred Astaire opens the movies' first number(in his trademark top hat and white tails!)with ""Bring on the Beautiful Girls"".We find a very young Cyd Charisse here along with then screen veteran Lucille Ball.Next we have swim star Esther Williams doing the ""Water Ballet"" sequence; it is amazing how graceful and poised she could be underwater.Next we have vaudeville star Ed Wynn's son,Keenan,doing a funny turn with ""Number Please"".Next famous tenor James Melton and Marion Bell do a fine number pulled from the opera La Traviata.We then go back to comedy with Victor Moore playing the plaintive plaintiff and Edward Arnold doing the wise-guy/lawyer bit in ""Just pay the two dollars"".Next we are treated to Fred Astaire and Lucille Bremer in a wonderful dance/story sequence called ""This Heart of Mine"".Comedy makes its' comeback again with veteran stage star Fanny Brice,Hume Cronyn and William Frawley in ""Sweeepstakes Ticket"".Frawley plays a disgruntled apartment landlord and it is very easy to think that since Ball appeared in the picture also,that when she was casting for just such a landlord for her ""I Love Lucy"" show that she would remember Frawley!The next vignette stars singing sensation Lena Horne doing a sultry song called ""Love"".Red Skelton next reprises his wonderful Guzzlers Gin sketch in a more modern fashion in ""When Television Comes"".Astaire and Bremer come back again to dance in arguably the best musical/fantasy sequence of the film,""Limehouse Blues"".If you doubt for a single second Astaire's peerless dancing technique watch any of his routines here but don't miss this one!Judy Garland comes on next for what I feel is the weakest vignette of the movie ""An Interview"".It's played to the edge by Garland but the song and lyrics push the entire production right over the cliff.Next in their only dancing partnership on film Gene Kelly and Astaire sing ""The Babbitt and the Bromide""(the smug businessman and the bore!).This is a number which Fred had great success with when performed in the 1927 stage production of ""Funny Face"" with his wonderful and talented sister Adele.Kelly apparently had reservations about doing the number at all but acquiesced in the end.To end the picture we have the lovely Kathryn Grayson singing ""Beauty"".This film is viewed like a book,with each different numbers' title and star's name(s) highlighted for us to see on a page as it is flipped over.However unlike a book,there is nothing structured or anything with a plot to tie it all together with.All are distinctive and stand alone vignettes of music,dance and comedy.Some sketches thrive because of it or fall for the same reason.MGM has brought this to DVD with a just above-average print transfer.It is very nice to watch but much could have been done to really make this print shine.Along with the film itself we have in the special features section a featurette on the film""An Embarrassment of Riches"",""The Luckiest Guy in the World"",starring a young Barry Nelson,two cartoons and  some nice audio only outtakes from the film.All in all this movie is highly recommended.It is best watched and savoured as each vignette plays out before you.Each sequence will either fly or fall on its' own merit as there is no common thread to be found. This film is definitely the sum of all its' parts.There are relatively few weak spots in this picture and there are many that are must sees,and most of them belong to the legendary Fred Astaire.",N/A

49177,"From his days withMonty Pythonto his visionary epic Brazil, Terry Gilliam has never been an ordinary filmmaker. His unique sense of style and his trademark absurdist humor can be found in all of his films. In 1995, he cemented his reputation as one of the most unconventional directors in America with his brilliant science fiction film, 12 Monkeys. 12 Monkeys is an apocalyptic, romantic, time travel adventure inspired by the French film,La Jet&eacute;e, which was written by Chris Marker. However, Gilliam's film is entirely his own, a stunning masterpiece of contemporary cinema, and one of the most cleverly bizarre films ever made. The screenplay was written by David and Janet Peoples, who inject the story with an intimate humanistic quality, juxtaposing romance with an eerie atmosphere of impending disaster.In the year 2035, James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner in a subterranean stronghold where the last survivors of a cataclysmic virus are held up. Their world is monitored by a panel of scientists who use the prisoners for mysterious experiments. Cole is selected to go up onto the Earth's desolate surface and collect life forms for the scientists to study. Upon his return to the underground prison, Cole is told that he's a candidate for an experiment, which if it were successful he would be given a full pardon. He is sent back in time to discover the source of the virus, but he arrives in the wrong year. After getting into a fight with police officers, Cole is sent to a rundown insane asylum where he befriends a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). He also meets a host of mentally dysfunctional patients, including a paranoid schizophrenic named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) who spends most of his time watching cartoons, harassing other patients, and ranting about government conspiracies. Jeffrey helps Cole in an escape attempt, which ends with Cole being caught by the mental hospital's guards and being put into an isolation room, heavily restrained. He mysteriously disappears from the hospital and arrives back in the future. There, the scientists tell him that despite his failure he has been exceptionally useful. They ask him if he would be willing to go back and further investigate the 12 Monkeys... and Jeffrey Goines who may be involved with their formation. However Cole is sent, not only to the wrong time but the wrong place. He lands in Southern France, in the middle of WWI. He's shot in the leg before he vanishes into time.Meanwhile, Kathryn Railly has been giving lectures on abnormal psychology and the theoretical ""Cassandra complex"", which states that some people suffer a mental disorder that makes them believe that they are clairvoyant, and knowledgeable of future catastrophes. After one of her lectures, she's ambushed by a strange man who wants her to drive him to Philadelphia. It's Cole and he's traced the origin of the virus to Jeffrey Goines and his billionaire virologist father. Kathryn convinces Cole that he's delusional, but then Cole's story is proven to be true when she discovers that the bullet she removed from his leg dates back to the first quarter of the 20th century. Now she must uncover the truth and help Cole to stop the spread of the virus, but nothing is what it appears to be.The entire cast is superb. Bruce Willis delivers one of his most nuanced performances as Cole, creating a strong yet vulnerable man who must overcome his own fears of madness in order to save humanity. Madeleine Stowe gives a fascinating performance of a sane woman, who must call into question all of her long held beliefs, and face the insanity of the world around her. But the most memorable character is Jeffrey Goines, who is brought to by Brad Pitt in one of his most remarkable performances ever. He succeeds in making Goines sympathetic, funny, and completely manic. Not only does show off his underutilized versatility as an actor, Brad Pitt also gives us, the audience, access to the off kilter world in which the entire film unfolds. As for Gilliam's direction, 12 Monkeys proves that he's capable of making films that are not only humorous, but stark and profound as well. Ironically, the film's greatest flaw is also its greatest strength. As an audience, we are never explicitly told how the story ends. Sure, there are implications within the film, but there are so many different interpretations that one single idea feels constricting and limiting. Terry Gilliam's brilliance is that he doesn't dictate his story to the viewers; rather he allows them to discover its subtleties and secrets on their own, and then draw their own conclusions. It makes the film even more interesting to watch with a group of friends and everyone's perception of the ending is contrary. It's this idea of open interpretation that makes 12 Monkeys so timeless.Also recommended:Monty Python's Flying Circus: Terry Gilliam's Personal BestMonty Python and the Holy GrailJabberwockyTime BanditsBrazilThe Adventures of Baron MunchausenThe Fisher KingFear and Loathing in Las Vegas",N/A

1121507,"A total surprise. The concept begs for derision and kept me away for many months, fearing yet another ham-handed mauling of Beatles material and a clueless painting of the era.What I got instead was probably the most perfect and realistic portrayal of what it was like to be a young person in counterculture America in the late Sixties that I've ever seen in fictional film...Four reasons come to mind, the film having just ended five minutes ago.1) The performances of the uniformly excellent cast are truly superb. No one is TRYING to be a hippie. Nobody is ACTING in the grandest sense.2) The sets, costumes and hair are right on the money - they look totally authentic - as compared for example with Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" which looks like the director ran up big bills at the hippie wig and hippie clothes and hippie poster rental store in Burbank.3) The music. As a lifelong Beatles fan I usually cringe at cover versions. In this film the songs are treated with such great respect... emphasizing their beauty and emotional impact by keeping the production very spare and (with the exception of Sadie's) the vocals quiet and heartfelt. I'll be buying the CD tomorrow. Some of the performances just tear your heart out.4) Brilliant direction. I mean brilliant. No excess, no histrionics, no cliches, everything is kept real and muted. This director understands the benefits of silence and stillness, and that the real music is between the notes.""Across the Universe"" is the perfect balance of beauty and horror, fearlessness and fear, joy and ultimate heartbreak, and that's what the Sixties were if you were there. We were all young and innocent, and we grew up very quickly. In just a few heartbeats.If you're of the age where you lived through the era, you were against the war and you lived near a city, you'll look at this wonderful film and say I knew those people.... I lived in those apartments.... I was at those demonstrations... I wore those clothes... and I sang those songs, those timeless, exquisitely gorgeous songs...If you want to show someone what the Sixties were really like, show them this film.

1060986,"Mission:Magic was one of the first origanal animated series from Filmation. It was also one of the first cartoons to have a diversified cast of characters.

The only downfall to the show was the terrible laugh track that was included with each episode.The characters in the show were:Rick Springfield - This legendary singer used a gramophone to get in contact with the Adventurer's Club to give them missions in magical lands to solve mysteries. Rick has a pet owl called Ptolemy. Rick has a song he sings in almost every episode of the series.Miss Tickle - The teacher in charge of the Adventurer's Club who had magical powers and a magical cat called Tut-Tut who is a stone statue of ancient lore that becomes a real cat. Miss Tickle uses school supplies like chalk, keys and erasers as magical items, and has a magical purse that when a knob is turned, makes the Adventurer's Club members fly.Carol - A blonde girl who is infatuated with Rick Springfield.Harve - A chubby kid with glasses who always lands on his rump unlike everyone else who lands on their feet when they are flying to a mission. Harve is afraid of heights and thinks he can do anything.Socks - Wears a hat that looks like Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat.Vinnie - Messes up his speech all the timeFranklin - Black student who always talks about how he doesn't like how tall he is.Kim - Asian girl who seems to be the most level headed of the group.Principal Samuels - Only in a couple of episodes but loves to tell tall tales.Some fun facts about Mission: Magic - Miss Tickle and Tut-Tut debuted on another cartoon series The Brady Kids (an animated version of the Brady Bunch). Tut-Tut and Ptolemy were based off the poem The Owl and the Pussycat. The episode Horse Feathers is the only time another character sings a song other than Rick Springfield.

The picture and sound is great and it comes with a booklet with brief info on character's (heroes and villains) and summaries of all the episodes. I also want to say that I appreciate that funimationn has made all the sets the same layout so they lineup well on a shelf.I Hope they release the ninth season earlier than May but who knows, whenever they do we'll get to see the Fusion and Kid Buu sagas finishing up this series on DVD.I've enjoyed rewatching these episodes that I remember so well despite not having seen them since they originally aired way back at the turn of the millenium. I find myself watching familiar moments and enjoying them in completely new and different ways than I did as a youth. I'm sure many enjoy this season since it's getting us into the final saga's and battles of DragonBall Z but I always found these sagas different for a reason that I'm just now understanding. Other than the thirteen originals that broadcast in the mid-nineties, that I actually remember watching, Dragon Ball hadn't aired in North America so most of us were introduced to DBZ first. I got used to the show being very science fiction oriented with the first few seasons of alien threats, space travel, killer androids and time travel and then came this final run of Majin Buu, which was more about magic and crazy fighting techniques. After having seen the Dragon Ball series in it's entirety now and looking at these episodes I appreciate them more because I understand that Akira Toriyama had simply taken the series back to it's roots for the final sagas. The original Dragon Ball was all about crazy fighting styles and ridiculous moves and it had many elements of magic, for DBZ he had been influenced more by Sci-Fi in an attempt to change up the story but here knowing he was bringing it to an end he must have decided to take it back to the earliest days.Any fan of DBZ will find these enjoyable, the final face off between Goku and Vegeta, Goten and Trunks learning Fusion, Goku transforming to SS3. I even find Goten and Trunks trying to fight in disguise as an adult and Eighteen fighting Hercule in a melee tournament amusing B stories. I'm glad this will be out in February and can't wait to finish this series with the final two sagas and the ninth boxed set. Thanks.",Dragon Ball Z: Season 8

206447,"I greet the release of She Done Him Wrong on DVD with mixed emotions.First, my review of the film - She Done Him Wrong was Mae West's personal favorite among her 12 movies, and 75 years after its release, it is still considered a classic by most critics and many fans.  The film is often credited with saving Paramount Studios from bankruptcy, and made Mae West the box-office sensation of 1933.  Thanks to this film, the phrase, ""Come up and see me sometime"" entered the language and immortalized a woman now long-revered for her comic timing and salty double-entendres (although her most famous phrase was something of a misquote; her actual line to Cary Grant was, ""Why don't `cha come up sometime, see me?  Don't be afraid, I won't tell.  Come up, I'll tell your fortune.  Ooohh, you can be had!"").  Based on her notorious Broadway smash Diamond Lil, Miss West was forced to change the lead character's name (if not the basic plot) to appease the censors, and Diamond Lil became Lady Lou, ""One of the finest women ever walked the streets"".  Peppered with hilarious bons mots such as, ""When women go wrong, men go right after them"", the script, which she wrote herself, contains more wit in each scene than some modern so-called comedies have in a whole movie.  For a film that runs a mere 62 minutes, it's packed with fun, drama, wonderful period atmosphere and great performances from an ensemble cast, many of whom appeared in the stage version.  Mae's sultry singing of the song, ""A Guy What Takes His Time"" was so suggestive that the censors removed all but one verse of it from her filmed rendition, although she managed somehow to simultaneously release it on a 78 record that contained verse after verse of uncensored, ribald, raw sexuality.While I am thrilled to finally have this movie available on DVD, it dashes my hopes that some of Mae West's more obscure films will ever find a digital release.Universal Studios (who owns the rights to all Paramount titles) previously released on individual DVD's only three Mae West classic titles: I'm No Angel (1933), Belle of the Nineties (1934), and Klondike Annie (1937).  Each of these early DVD releases has been long out of print.  Early in 2005, My Little Chickadee (1940) was released as part of the W. C. Fields collection, and later that year, Universal released five titles in the ""Mae West Glamour Collection"", Night After Night (1932), Go West, Young Man (1935), Goin' To Town (1936) and the previously mentioned I'm No Angel and My Little Chickadee.  I was hoping that a ""Mae West Glamour Collection, Volume Two"" would eventually contain the out-of-print Belle of the Nineties and Klondike Annie, along with She Done Him Wrong, and her remaining two classic films, Every Day's A Holiday (1937) and the rarely seen, The Heat's On (1943), both of which have never been on DVD at all.  Curiously enough, the UK version of the Mae West Classic Collection included The Heat's On, although it was originally released by Columbia; I guess this means that Universal does have the rights.  BUT, the release of She Done Him Wrong as a single DVD has now dashed my hopes that the other classic titles will ever be released.  This is a pity.  Some critics - and I concur - consider Klondike Annie (more of a drama than a comedy) to be Mae's finest effort, and Every Day's A Holiday is one of her more hilarious outings on celluloid.I am hoping against hope that this release signals the forthcoming issue of the few of Mae West's classics that have not been seen in a digital format, but only time will tell.",She Done Him Wrong VHS
1184031,"Before i get to the review, allow me some observations about the director's career.  M Night Shyamalan has somehow found himself among the most unfairly criticized of modern filmmakers in spite of the fact that every one of his films are among the most unique, atmospheric, and imaginative out there.  Like Tarantino, it has become fashionable among the too-cool-for-the-room set to bash everything the man does even as they wait in line on opening day for each of his films.  You won't see me tripping over myself to check out the latest Paul Anderson or Uwe Boll joint.  Why continue to follow the career of a hack?  Even the usually even-headed Trey Parker and Matt Stone are guilty of Shyamalan bashing.  The most popular criticism is that his films rely solely on twists.  The truth is that onlyThe Sixth Sensehad a profound twist and most will agree that the film was already compelling up to that point.  Yet both film and director have been branded regardless.  Each film he has made has been nearly unclassifiable and very different from what would be expected of any film genre.  This is called creativity, folks.  It's a shame that people can't be comfortable without having each and every preconception and cliche met.Lady in the Water-while essentially a film about childhood- was really a feature-length taunting of his critics.  Childish?  That was the point.  As a fan of the director's work I really enjoyed that.  Small wonder the reviews were bad; most viewers either didn't understand what they were watching or they were the ones being insulted.  Okay, rant over.  On to M Night Shyamalan's latest.""The Happening"" was a great concept.  Mark Wahlburg plays our protagonist, a hip science teacher who we meet lecturing his students about Einstein's theory that if bees vanished off of the face of the Earth, mankind would die out shortly after.  Right away we are reminded of humanity's susceptibility to nature and inability to fully comprehend it's workings.  Then it ""Happens"".  By now you all know that ""it"" is a wave of mass suicide; one that begins sweeping across New England with frightening speed.  The resulting carnage will leave horror fans drooling for more.  Wahlburg's character gathers up his wife and his best friend (played by a brilliant John Leguizamo) with daughter and flees New York along with the rest of the surviving populace.  Great filmmaking.The deaths in ""The Happening"" are the main draw.  In spite of the advertisements' focus on the fact that this is Shyamalan's first R-rated feature, the director uses impeccable restraint in portraying the violent suicides and keeps the profanity nearly nonexistent.  The killshots are suspensful and teasing, showing enough to shock and disturb you, but never lingering enough to become gruesome.  My favorite suicide involves a man at the zoo entering the lion's cage.  The scene is shown as footage from a handheld camera and the result is jarring and unclear, but certainly violent and gory.  The concept, as always, is a brilliant one; nature evolving to strike back at mankind is truly good stuff.  The first half of this film is outstanding.  Unfortunately, it overstays it's welcome.Now the bad.  Leguizamo is the only worthwhile performance and he is grossly underused.  Wahlburg and his onscreen wife Zooey Deschanel have zero chemistry (though she does have beautiful eyes) and there are more than a few moments where you wonder if the comedic acting is intentional or not.  And the menacing shots of trees are anything but menacing.  Sorry, there is just no way to make a tree shaking in the wind scary unto itself.  And the gimmick of having the victims walk a few steps backwards before offing themselves strikes me as more than a little bit silly.  The stopping dead in their tracks and saying bizarre things was all well and good, but why would they walk backwards?  So goofy.  In spite of the movie's plodding pace, many of the film's concepts are very poorly fleshed-out.  Watching Wahlburg's character put the pieces together is great until Shyamalan apparently decides to throw them out the window for the sake of being mysterious or some such thing.  More could have been done with the mood ring, which comes off as a gimmick to give the characters something to talk about while a whole lot of nothing happens.  Human energy and moods are talked about but never properly integrated into the story's events like they should have been.  Sloppy.  Very sloppy.I hate to become one of Shyamalan's critics, but this was a poorly put together story that would have made an amazing episode ofMasters of Horror, but just was not ready to be a feature length film.  The first half was jaw-dropping at times and extremely promising, but the characters quickly become tiresome and eventually you're left just waiting for the next death scene.  This script needed some serious work and Shyamlan's filmmaking talents could not fully vindicate his poor writing this time around.  But in spite of it's laundry list of shortcomings, ""The Happening"" has some very worthwhile concepts and deaths that make it worth a peek.  Consider this least of m Night Shyamalan's flicks a tentative rental.  Pass if you're not a fan of his work.  Who am I kidding?  Most of those guys ran out and saw it before I did.  2 1/2 stars rounded up for a strong first half.",N/A

I for one love the series and thus loved this movie, yes it has it's flaws, it's sorta meandering and i wanted at times to jump into the screen to smack some of the characters, but overall, it was very true to the series.  For me, it was just great to see the characters back, and watch them once again navigate the NYC scene.  The fashion is back and SJP is still struting in here Manolo's and wearing the most bizarre things.

1006699,"Anyone who has seen David Mamet's work, knows that this writer is very complex. Seemingly racist or superficial dialog(s), always lead to a climatic ending. Although I have never seen ""Edmond"" as a play, the film definitely feels more like a play than a film. Quick dialogs and brief encounters lead us to a dramatic change in a life of a middle aged dilusional man. Edmond is 47 year old professional who suddenly realizes that he is bored with his life, his wife and work. On a whim, he decides to leave it all and pursue a search for higher self. The women who could give him excitement he is looking for, are all for hire (ladies of the night) and apparently - according to Edmond - they cost too much. Which tells us that Edmond was either married for too long, or ""born yesterday"". In the course of one night, Edmond's life changes completely. In the end, he is in place and time where he manages to: have time to meditate on purpose of (his) life, get over his prejudices (racial and otherwise) and finally break away from the boredom what was haunting him thru the last several years of his marriage. The end of this unusual thriller is worth ending several overbearing moments we are forced to go thru in the course of the movie. This just may be one of those controversial movies that general public will love to hate.",Edmond
1124239,"Director P.T. Anderson has created a moumental but flawed film about one man's ambition as it comes into conflict with the concept of faith. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil!, There Will Be Blood tells the story of independant oilman Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) as he struggles to get rich in turn of the century America.Day-Lewis,channeling John Huston, gives a career defining performance as a man totally alone in his ambition to become rich. This film is a character study more than an action narrative. Daniel Plainview is a complex man with no friends, no sense of history and presumably no morals as he attempts to control his destiny in the growing oil business. When he comes into conflict with an evangelical preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) true colors are shown and a fight to the finish is begun.The performance by Day-Lewis won him a deserved Best Actor Oscar. Also of note is the great camara work by Richard Elswit and the unique musical score by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.I viewed the two disc edition which features the film on disc one and special features on the second disc. The special features include 15 minutes of stills and research to a Greenwood score, two trailers and some deleted scenes. These extras run for about 30 minutes. The main feature here is The History of Petroleum (1923-27) a silent black and white film produced by Sinclair Oil and the US Bureau of Mines. This short is also scored by Greenwood.This film is definately worth checking out but may be a better rental than purchase. One further note the packaging on this set is horrible. The discs are squeezed into cardboard sleeves that virtually insure scratching with repeated viewings.",There Will Be Blood
721404,"This 2008 repackaging of 2001's ""A History of Britain"", featuring Simon Schama as author and presenter, is not the standard history of Great Britain.  Schama is no slave to historical convention and his 15-episode retelling explores British history from a slightly different point of view.Schama's famous BBC series traces British history from Roman Britain through the death of Winston Churchill in 1965.  His focus is not timeline oriented; many prominent players in British history rate no more than passing mention.  Even the iconic Churchill has to share the last episode with Eric Blair, better known by his literary name of George Orwell.  Instead, Schama seeks to identify the slow, difficult steps by which Britain became a constitutional monarchy with individual freedoms and the rule of law.  Those steps are found in Roman Britain, in the endless dynastic and religious wars that defined the powers of the monarchy and parliament, in the disaster of the Black Death, and in the long political and military struggles to build a united British nation and then a British empire.The episodes feature important archeological sites, castles, ruined abbeys, and other locations where important events took place. We meet the prominent personalities of the narrative through pictures, paintings, sculptures, tomb representations, and, rarely, reenactment.  Schama narrates in person, stalking through ruins, landscapes and museums while delivering his rather blunt colloquial commentary.""A History of Britain"" is not for everyone.  The thematic presentation may be hard to follow for those not already familiar with British history.  Those wedded to a romantic vision of a storied past may find Schama's blunt disection of power politics to be off-setting.  Schama's twitchy physical presence may be distracting for some viewers.On the other hand, this telling of British history is engaging, realistic, and thought-provoking in getting at the heart of what it means to be British.  The story is as much Scottish, Irish, and Welsh as English in coverage.  Prominent personalities are shown in their full rounded humanity. The presention itself is polished work.  ""A History of Britain"" is therefore highly recommended to fans of British history looking for a fresh angle.",N/A
511171,"Along with ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God,"" ""Fitzcarraldo"" ranks as the best collaboration between Herzog and Kinski.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it comes close to being the best thing that either of them did, Herzog as director and Kinski as actor.In both ""Aguirre"" and ""Fitzcarraldo,"" the theme is humanity against an unforgiving, primitive nature, symbolized by clotted, almost impenetrable jungle and indigeneous tribes whose customs and beliefs are baffling and unpredictable to ""civilized"" minds.  Both Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo are defeated by nature, but whereas Aquirre is destroyed by his defeat, Fitzcarraldo triumphs in defeat.  I suspect that one of the points Herzog wants to make is that the unbridled lust for power, manifested by Aguirre, is a different kind of human ambition than the sheer love of beauty that animates Fitzcarraldo.  The former is easy to defeat.  The latter may fall, but it will inevitably rise again.  Even nature--tribal children and animals in the film--responds to beauty.The great irony here is that beauty, unlike power, is ""useless.""  It has no obvious utility in the ""real world.""  That's why at one point a skeptical entrepreneur mocks Fitzcarraldo and his dreams to bring opera to the jungle by calling him a ""conquistador of the useless.""  This line reminds me of an observation once made by Henry David Thoreau.  After remarking that there were plenty of schools and clubs for the ""diffusion of useful knowledge,"" he said ""methinks we need a school for the diffusion of useless knowledge.""  It's the ""useless"" things in life that reveal life's depth.The acting in ""Fitzcarraldo"" is superb.  Kinski shows a tender, lovable side in his portrayal of the title character that's both remarkable and in wonderful contrast to the crazy Kinski who too often explodes on the screen (although apparently Kinski the man was so emotionally volatile on the set that one of the tribal extras, offended by his craziness, offered to kill him if only Herzog would give the word).  Claudia Cardinale as Molly is exquisite, and the chemistry (as they say) between her and Kinski works well.Finally, the cinematography is indescribable.  Of course the temptation is to focus on the long shots of the ship ""Molly"" being hauled up the Peruvian mountainside.  But every scene in the film, from the opening shots of the well-lighted opera house facade standing starkly against a jet-black sky, to the final scene of ""The Puritans,"" is breathtaking.",N/A
185718,"This DVD is a total delight. Though snappy and upbeat, it actually depicts a child having a problem, and solving that problem through empathic adult guidance and the support of her peers. I say ""actually"" because the other popular Barney DVD about playing school depicts a near-perfect world in which everyone is unceasingly happy except, for a brief moment, Baby Bop. In addition to the original Barney music, which, in this production, is particularly good, the DVD contains scores of Mother Goose rhymes, usually put to music and adorably acted out i.e Mary Had A Little Lamb. Also, the woman who plays Mother Goose is superb: I just wish they'd put her name on the DVD box! The bottom line is that this is a great DVD for young children esp. those interested in/attracted to rhyming.

1064138,"The story of ""Grbavica"" follows a single mother Esma (Mirjana Karanovic) and her 12-year-old daughter Sara (Luna Mijovic) living quietly in the post-war Sarajevo. (The film's title ""Grbavica"" refers to a district of the city of Sarajevo.)Sara is looking forward to joining in a school trip. She knows the children of Shaheed or war martyr do not have to pay, but they need to turn in a certificate to the school beforehand. Remembering that her mother said her dead father was a Shaheed, Sara asks Esma to give her a certificate, but Esma would rather pay full price, and keeps working hard at seedy night club....Set in today's Sarajevo, ""Grbavica"" is an arresting love story of mother and daughter. (In her message to Iwanami Hall in Japan where the film was shown, director Jasmila Zbanic said the film is about love.) But besides the loving (and vulnerable) relations between mother and daughter, the film is also about the war and its aftermath, and Mirjana Karanovic's superb acting as Esma with a secret effectively tells the tragic story of war without being preachy.""Grbavica"" has also sub-plots about Esma and Pelda (Leon Lucev), mysterious bouncer hired by the club where Esma works, and about strong-minded Sara and her boyfriend. These supporting characters are largely credible with excellent performances even though several episodes should have been left in the cutting room, such as characters carrying a loaded handgun.The simple and emotional story, I think, needs more time to be told especially in the wrap-up. Maybe Sara wanted to say something more to her mother, but perhaps it should be left unsaid. Whatever it is, it is told beautifully in her last action that is moving and touching, just like the film itself.",Grbavica: the Land of My Dreams

If you don't know what happened to women's rights when the Fundamentalist's rose to power in Iran, this film explains these things with simple, tough charm. It's important that this film even exists, imo. I think everyone should see it, whether they like it or not- it will give you alot to think about and hopefully, talk about.*spoiler*If I have one problem with this film, it's that as the main character grows older and more disenchanted (while trying even harder to fit in) with the intolerance towards women in her society, the story turns to several pointless romances.  After an hour and a half of feeling like a witness (thru Marjane's recollections) to an avalanche of personal tragedy and the humor that comes with surviving it, we jarringly go into a weird romantic interlude, where Marjane has a string of crappy relationships, gets married, gets divorced, leaves Iran yet again (and presumably for good) at which point the film ends.Kindof like someone pulling the needle across the vinyl before a good song ends, and I understand she's making a political statement about how she feels; that there's nothing she has left but the memories of her family, uncle and grandmother... its just that the romantic interlude cheapened the power of it.For this viewer.Still a damn important cultural document, though.

1057141,"I actually find this season quite a joy to view.  The reason I only give it four stars is the diminished presance of Phylicia Rahsad on camera.  [It's almost as if you see more of Denise, the Hillman freshman, than you do of Clair.]  Even knowing that she was on maternity restriction carrying then-husband Ahmad's fourth child doesn't really make up for the absence of Clair Huxtable during the middle part of the season.  Although, I've got to admit, the tricks they played to mask her pregnancy are pretty charming, in retrospect.Having gotten past that issue, this set still includes some of my favourite moments in the whole series (""Food for Thought,"" ""Cliff In Charge,"" ""Rudy Spends the Night,"" ""Calling Dr. Huxtable,"" ""The Shower,"" ""I know that You Know"" and ""Bald and Beautiful.""  Also of significant note is the season finale, ""Hillman,"" in which all seven Huxtables convine at Dr. & Mrs. Huxtable's alma mater (which never really existed) to honor its retiring president (Joe Seneca guesting).  There, we hear Clair soloing with the college choir (I believe that's really Phylicia's voice).  Partly on the heels of this episode, we see the creation of a spinoff show, A Diffeent World, which takes place right there at Hillman College.I actually found the menu-diving very comprehensive and had no trouble navigating the options.  And, the dual-act set-up is ideal, when there's a specific piece of an episode you want to see (such as the latter half of ""You Only Hurt the Ones You Love"").  Then again, I've only liked playing individual episodes.  (If you want to jump from one to the next, you can just hit fast-forward on your remote.)  I would've liked to see a bonus section, containing commentary or season bloopers, as with Season 2.  But, what can you do?

950084,"Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1943 film Day Of Wrath (Vredens dag), adapted from Hans Wiers-Jenssens' novel, Day Of Wrath, by Dreyer, is an earlier, better version of the issues tackled in Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible, because, even though the film was made during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, and there are obvious parallels to be drawn between that and the film's narrative, it is never as psychologically obvious nor melodramatic as Miller's later allegory on McCarthyism. This is never made more clear than at the film's end, where the psychologically fragile Anne (Lisbeth Movin) is betrayed by her horrid mother-in-law, her lover, and her own psyche, and actually comes to believe in her own guilt of being a witch, for wishing the death of her aged husband.The whole film is also a more realistic depiction of self-delusion than Miller's play, as the 17th Century Danish Inquisitors who torture, maim, and kill in the name of their beliefs show how easily good intentions can become twisted. Anne is clearly the central figure, and her rise and fall, from shy dour hausfrau of old Reverend Absalon Pedersson (Thorkild Roose), to energetic vibrant lover of his son, Martin (Preben Lerdorff Rye), who is about the same age as her, and returns to the home after years abroad, to denounced, deluded, and subservient victim of her wicked mother-in-law, Merete (Sigrid Neiiendam), is the center of the film's drama and emotion.Day Of Wrath is one of the most masterful black and white films ever made, and the use of shadow by Dreyer and cinematographer Karl Andersson is stunning. Only other Dreyer films come close to being as effective in the use of such as this film is.... Day Of Wrath is one of those films that is possibly difficult to judge by modern standards, yet if it is not clearly a great film, the way his earlier Vampyr is, it's only because it is not a genre work, like that film, and thus not subject to a more delimited horizon. In many ways, these same issues would be tackled a decade and a half later, in Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, a more modern and complex work, yet one which never quite hits the visceral peaks this film does. And, comparisons to other great works of art are never to be dismissed lightly. Neither is Day Of Wrath.",Day of Wrath

And don't get me wrong, he was a great asset being the character they most turned to for advise in all areas of the psyque. Joe Mantegna is more likable -sorry Mandy- and though he was brought to the show almost abruptly, they show you how he adapts gradually to everybody and the new way things are done at the BAU since he had been part of it when it began. Throughout the season, Joe Mantegna integrates the team like a piece of a puzzle that didn't quite fit was removed and placed by the perfect one, and now I see that the show will not only survive it's leading character but will do better with the new one.Now, the plot. Unfortunately, there are so many sick in this world that they will never run out of new ideas for a show.

Which nation is next on the Kremlin's invasion list?If Western leadership does not quickly awaken from its self-inflicted slumber and confront Moscow & their cohorts, many of us in the Free World shall be languishing in the very nightmare depicted in 'The Lives of Others', except this time the 'others' shall be 'us'!",N/A

377071,"I first went here to Amazon to decide whether or not to watch this movie, and after reading the first line of the Amazon editorial review for the two-disc version which said,  ""There have been few better movies in the history of the planet than The Third Man,""  well, that, of course, was convincing enough, right? I didn't bother reading any more. After watching it twice (the second time to make sure I didn't miss something entirely), all I can say is, Mr. Jameson (the editorial reviewer), what planet do you live on? You've got to be kidding.Yeah, the cinematography is great, and film-school sophomores will ooh and aah over the black and white camera angles and dramatic use of lighting, probably ogling over that aspect so much that they miss completely the dismal nature of the story and characters, which I suspect most of the reviewers do also.Yeah, it's well acted too. And hey, it's beautifully lit. The lighting man should have gotten as much credit as Carol Reed. This leads to one of my most down and dirty complaints about this movie. Where's all that light coming from down there in the sewers in the middle of the night? Chase scenes through brick caverns which should be pitch black, and none of the main characters are carrying any form of torch or flashlight. Well,  they didn't need one. It was all so nicely, although somewhat dimly, lit down there. You could even see rats scurrying fifty feet away.The fiftieth anniversary edition which I have has an interesting little featurette showing actual film footage of those sewers, and yes, I'm right, they're pitch black--in the middle of the day no less--just as one would assume. Usually, I'll give a film some leeway on stuff like this, but sorry, the scenario is essential to the plot. Quite frankly, the way these scenes are, it's pure movie fantasyland. I guess for most people, you can get away with  anything in the movies, however preposterous.  If the Lone Ranger can easily jump his horse thirty feet from one canyon side to the other, then what's a little light down in the sewers where there shouldn't be any? Carol Reed must have known the sewers were actually pitch black. So did Orson Welles, So did Joseph Cotten, So did...etc., etc. No one said, ""Um,  Mr. Reed, you know, there's actually no light down in the underground sewers, especially in the middle of the night?"" Or maybe I missed that part where one of the characters, twice, turned on the sewer's master switch for all those mysterious bulbs down there which provided light, but yet, were nowhere to be seen? And then if that's the case, what's with those Russian police who show up later carrying torches? I guess Russians have really bad low light vision compared to the rest of us. Poor guys--short-sighted Commies.As for the story, how would you characterize it? Seems like it should be something called ""Pathetic Comedy,"" and on my second viewing I looked to see if maybe I  missed the crucial fact that it's actually supposed to be a comedy. It's got that ridiculous zither score, after all. The main character is a dope who is a dope throughout--must have been a dope all his life if he hadn't seen this coming in Harry Lime--and ends still a dope. He's a sucker for a woman who's a dope, and she's even worse yet--she's a dope in complete denial that she's a dope. Cotten's character doesn't seem intelligent enough to fully realized he's a dope, while the woman...well, it's hard to say since she doesn't say much besides, ""I loved him"" and ""I love him."" Not much else going on in that mind. She's like a walking zombie when we first meet her, and she ends the same way (great shot though). Poor Calloway, he was right all along--he's surrounded by cheap criminals and duped dopes.But wait, Calloway's a dope too. He never looked at the body? He didn't check the dead man's body and clothing for evidence and cause of death before they hastily put him in the ground? They had a formal inquest, but none of the inspectors looked at the body of one of their top suspects? Preposterous!! Fire the whole military police force. They're completely inept. The Keystone Cops would have done better. More fantasyland!Maybe it really was suppose to be a comedy. If so, it was all miscast. For the fun of it, imagine the Calloway character being played by Groucho Marx instead. Same mustache and with a  good cigar. He calls the dopes into his office to play, ""You Bet Your Life"":""Now Mr. Martins, say the magic word and you win a trip back home. Ok now, here's your question. If he walks like a criminal, and quacks like a criminal, then he must be...?""""My best friend?"" Quack. Sorry. Cue the zither.A lot of reviewers rave about Orson Welles in this flick. Why? His part is borderline cameo. His presence is minimal. Yes, he's got that wry Welles smile. How did this smart-looking guy end up in bombed-out Vienna, anyway? He speechifies for a couple of minutes--makes a clever few lines about the Borgias and the Swiss which actually has no pertinence to the story. I mean, is high art or engineering going on someplace because of this little underground clique of his? Is Vienna blooming into a new Renaissance because of the support of the nefarious? Did I miss the scene where Harry's shown funding a monumental marble statue of David? Maybe it was somewhere down in that big gloomy sewer tunnel. From my viewing, I didn't  see anyone in Vienna even making a cuckoo clock. Maybe Harry paid for the balloons. He did invite Martins to Vienna for some reason. Maybe by sponsoring Martins he was hoping his dopey friend would turn into the next Machiavelli and write a new version of ""The Prince"" based on himself, Harry Lime, except this time the Prince would be a gun-slinging cowpoke. Harry Lime is basically the most pathetic guy in Vienna, and his plight is almost comical. It's ""High Noon"" between the Pulp Western writer and the big-time loser in the black hat.That speech by Welles was ad-libbed. Guess he saw a need to actually give this character a little historically informed philosophical depth which Graham Greene forgot to do--pretend he's a little more than just a greed-driven jerk with a disdain for everyone. Well, that was the extent of it--maybe a minute or two of deep thought. Now, on to chasing the sewer rat. If you're looking for any surprise revelations after that scene, you'll be disappointed. I've read some saying there's layers of intrigue in this film. No there's not. There's one layer of criminal intrigue, a pathetic death, and a couple of dopes for whom, at the end, it all just seems to keep flying over their heads.Sorry folks, from my point of view, the script is weak. Questions about loyalty? Only a dope would find reason to remain loyal after that ferris wheel scene, loves or no loves. Calloway has to resort to tricks of graphic displays to conquer dopey--how pathetic.The Europeans seem to always get a kick out of portraying Americans as naive dupes. I'll tell you, that's what this film is about and I wouldn't doubt that it's one of the main reasons the movie made it to the top of the BFI's Best of the 20th Century list. The subconscious, after all, is a great ruler over our sense of pleasure. That ending is just laughing at Mr. Martins, the dopey American.Here's some telling facts. Graham Greene's original story concept had all British main characters, except for one American character. Guess who the one American character was. The American in Greene's original story was the Popescu character, who I would say seems to be the top dog, the shrewdest and most powerful of the criminal clique (Greene's original name for him was Cooler). So in the rewrite (by Reed?), the shrewdest character is changed from an American to an Eastern European, and the biggest dupe in the story is changed from an Englishman to an American (well, he's the biggest dupe besides the mentally ill Anna). Why the change of nationalities? Popular vote, maybe?My suggestion is, if you're into film noir, after you watch this one, go and watch Humphrey Bogart in ""The Big Sleep"" and decide which planet you'd want to be on. And if Orson were still around, I'd suggest to him that he go watch ""Chinatown"" again and then repeat his claim that there are no great performances in color (a claim that Peter Bogdanovich mentions in the special features of my DVD). In the history of film noir alone--on my  planet--I can think of a couple of films that I'd say are, at least, a little better than ""The Third Man.""Ok, so why don't you leave a comment or two along with the negative vote you're about to give my review. Try and address one of my complaints, maybe. How about the light underground. That should be easy. Try that for starters. But please, I don't think I want to hear any explanations for the zither. I'd rather not even  be reminded of it.Thanks for your time.**May 30, 2008: It's been more than a month since I posted this review and I've got 9 ""unhelpful"" votes, but no comments at all except a question mark. I'm really disappointed. No one wants to enlighten me as to what's wrong with my too long opinion of this movie? Go ahead, take a stab at me. Obviously, I'm not getting the bigger picture. Since I seem to be one of the few detractors of this film, I should be an easy target for the army of ""The Third Man"" enthusiasts.**",The Third Man VHS
1130273,"I've followed both the book and made-for-TV series for quite a while. While I believe the novel Comanche Moon was a pretty decent read, this movie adaptation is the worst of the Lonesome Dove series.Zahn did a decent job as Gus McRae (you can tell he had studied Duvall's  portrayal of the character and tried to get down the technique, and while not perfect, it wasn't bad) - but most of the other actors literally sounded like they were reading right from the script. Urban was really a terrible W.F.Call, and while I thought West Studi was good as Famous Shoes in Streets of Laredo, he didn't seem to fit the role of Buffalo Hump in this one, not at all. Val Kilmer was absolutely awful as Inish Scull. Instead of giving the impression he was a tough, if slightly eccentric Yankee-in-Texas, he came across as a clown.I noticed Halmark/Artisan didn't produce this one as they did the others in the series (which were all better - I'd rank them in this order as the best to least: Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo, Dead Man's Walk) and I don't know if that had something to do with it, but this was pretty bad. I'm not even comparing it to Lonesome Dove other than to say Zahn did a decent job of learning Duvall's mannerisms for McRae, but even as a stand alone Western this one just felt cheap and looked cheap. Almost no one seemed to have really gotten into acting their characters and it shows.",Comanche Moon: The Second Chapter in the Lonesome Dove Saga

Well, you're certainly not ready if you (or your kids) havent seen the first three Indiana Jones movies in the series. And this collection will do the trick perfectly.Okay...okay. I'm like 99% sure that it isn't absolutely necessary to see the first three movies in the series in order to fully enjoy the May 2008 release of Crystal Skull. But it will certain give you some history prior to jumping in to a 4th in a series, and it certainly won't be time wasted as they are excellent films.Raiders of the Lost Ark was stunning for its time (1981). No surprise with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg at the helm. Raiders holds up as one of the best action movies to date. Indiana Jones searches for and tries to protect a powerful relic from getting into the wrong hands. Viewers get thoroughly entertained with a fast moving, suspenseful and thrilling ride.In Temple of Doom (1984) Indy inadvertantly finds himself thrust into village overrun by an evil cult that commit human sacrifice and child slavery. Ironically, while the themes in Temple are much darker than its predessor, Spielberg actually 'dumbed it down' a bit (with some over the top slapstick and other silliness) in order to keep the film attractive to wider audiences and also to attain the first ever PG-13 rating (instead of an R).The Last Crusade (1989) brings in the great Sean Connery as Indy's dad, and together they fullfil a lifelong dream (more the Dad's dream than Indy's) of finding The Holy Grail. Strangely, Last Crusade got hit with a PG-13, but it was much lighter than Temple of Doom, and it went back to a more Lost Ark kind of action film.Overall, it was fun breaking out this collection (that I actually purchased here at Amazon 2004) and re-watching the movies with my kids. We're now all really psyched for 2008's Crystal Skull.For what it's worth, there is another collection coming out in May 2008 calledIndiana Jones - The Adventure Collection.

In the Midwest, this film was considered obscene and it is the Supreme Court that granted this movie not be equaled with pornography.  Made in black and white, this Malle's film is even more artistic in today's era.  Story is about a upper middle class married woman who lives in provinces (Dijon) with her newspaper editor husband.  She lives seemingly comfortable life in a large house, with full time nanny and servants.  Her husbands pays her very little or no attention, he is cold and emotionally unavailable.  They sleep in separate bedrooms.  To find some amusement, young wife Jeanne goes to Paris to visit her married childhood friend who mingles in high society.  It is there that she finds a lover, well-to-do polo player who she sees regularly until one day her husband decides to put a stop to her trips to Paris and have his wife's ""friends"" come a visit for the weekend.  He is determined to re-establish his dominion over his household and of course, his wife.  It is in preparation of this weekend, that Jeanne's car breaks down on the road and she gets a ride from the handsome, young stranger to her home.  As a token of gratitude, young man is invited for a supper and to spend a night in the house before he takes off to his destination the next day.  Frustrated that she cannot be with her lover, and outraged by her husband's possesive behavior, Jeanne wonders outside her bedroom at night, in the garden, where she and her mysterious savior find each other.  Before long, they realize strong attraction between them and make love in the garden and her bedroom.  Jeanne is sure she has found her soulmate and decides to leave everything behind: her young daughter Catherine, the big house, jewelry, clothes, everything.  In the dawn of the new day, as house guests are getting ready for the fishing trip, Jeanne and her lover leave house never to return again.  I do not believe that it is lovemaking scenes alone that made this film scandalous at the time.  This woman is almost like D.H. Lawrence's wife, who left her comfortable upper-middle class life of a wife and a mother for the big unknown with a much younger man.  All she is certain of is that she wants to be with a man she has met and there is no price to it.  She will sacrifice everything for her own happiness no matter how short, or long that happiness will last.  I have enjoyed watching interviews from a film director, actors and screenwriter and find film utterly beautiful and powerful, 50 years after it was made.

1076638,"As you can see on the splendid amazon.com interview, it really is the beginning of a new era of entertainment. David Lynch no is longer harassed by studios who are angry they agreed to work with DL in the first place, not worried about theatrical distribution (sadly I believe theaters are going to go out for good and will become as common as drive-ins, which may give rise to better films in theaters maybe) and doesn't have to fear freeloaders like Roger Ebert deciding for the mass public that his films aren't worth your time. With the internet and digital film (cutting the cost dramatically) artists are more free and can easily get their goods out to the fans and those who are curious can read many many informed opinions on all types of websites, messageboards, blogs, or a simple email, not having to rely on whats printed in JUST ONE review in a paper. David Lynch having a brutal career within the studio system is finally free to do whatever he wants and Inland Empire is an excessive 3 hour jam session on modest equipment and like any other jam session, it can be taken in bits or you can let it rush over you at once. It doesn't seem to make much of a difference in this case.I'm not wasting any time saying OH DUDE ITS SO WEIRD, I personally don't find any movies or music made by human beings ""weird"" anymore. Finding films weird is something you must have gotten over by now in this day and age unless you truly are fresh off Transformers The Movie being your best day at the cinema. Like most Lynch movies this is like a long lucid dream where one central object continuously morphs, ideas fade in and out, sometimes its senseless, funny, boring, unnerving or even moving. Possibly the most cerebral & thorough Lynch film since Eraserhead. Its great to see Harry Dean Stanton still has much to offer, Laura Dern is an amazing actress, keeps you drawn in with some of the best acting you'll ever experience. The rebirth and newfound freedom of David Lynch and anyone else looking to make movies is something to get excited about and this is an all guns blazing celebration of I CAN DO WHATEVER THE HECK I PLEASE goodness.

From the suspenseful 2-part conclusion to season one's cliffhanger to the amazing finale where we say goodbye to a dear friend, Aaron Sorkin, Thomas Schlamme and crew fire on all cylinders with witty dialogue and great characters dealing with realistic issues and storylines that could have been ripped from the headlines (most must be loosely based on actual events).The series is not afraid to have fun at the same time, like when Press Secretary CJ Cregg spends ""The Portland Trip"" wearing a Fighting Irish baseball hat because she dare make fun of President Bartlet's alma matter. Charlie spends most of the ""Shibboleth"" episode (directed by Laura Innes of ER fame) trying to pick out a knife for the President to carve his Thanksgiving turkey.Aside from the superb regular and recurring cast there are guest stars galore from Adam Arkin to Marlee Matlin and so many more.

When I saw it was available on DVD, I quickly purchased it to have it for my family so my 5 year old daughter, husband and I could enjoy it together.  The movie is simply infectious and has humor for all ages.  I mean, the whole idea is funny - a shaggy dog driving a car, a shaggy dog talking on a phone, a shaggy dog wearing pajamas, a shaggy dog chasing SPIES??!!""The Shaggy Dog, Wild & Wooly Edition"" is the DVD version featuring the original B/W film (slightly wide angle), the colorized version, and some extras.  The bonuses include cast interviews which are fun to see.  I know I prefer to see the original B/W, but my 5 1/2 year old vetoed me and so we watched the colorized version.The story is chock-full and has many veins and sub-plots, which add to the fun.  Basically, the story revolves around the Daniels family, with father, Wilson (Fred MacMurray), a retired postman, who (naturally) hates dogs; his wife, Frida, (played by Jean Hagen), and their two sons, Wilby (Tommy Kirk), a rather nerdy boy, and ""Moochie"" (Kevin Corcoran), his younger brother, who desperately wants a pet dog.  They live in, yes, I'm sure, the ""Leave It to Beaver"" house and on that same street you see ""The Beav"" walking on in those old shows.Throughout the movie, we see several stories playing out - a new neighbor moves in, an art dealer, his beautiful daughter, their butler and her shaggy dog.  Through a trip to the museum, a connection between shaggy ""Bratislavian Sheepdogs"", an old painting of the Lady Borgia and the ability to shape shift is revealed.  A mishap, a toppled table, a misplaced ring, an accidentally repeated incantation, and all at once, Wilby finds himself sprouting fur, and getting a black shiny nose!  A professor of history and art advises Wilby that the spell may be intermittent.  He doesn't realize how funny the adventures will be for the viewer.  Wilby always seems to be getting into trouble, whether it's his father firing buckshot at his shaggy behind (don't worry, he only gets the laundry), or turning into a Bratislavian Sheepdog during a dance with the pretty new girl.  Wilby, while a dog, overhears the new neighbor's plans to topple democracy, and the antics provided by a ten-year old, and a shaggy dog, and finally Wilson himself, trying to explain that yes, there is a spy ring in the neighborhood, and they know that because ""My son is a dog.  No, not all the time, just some of the time.""(!)Overall, this is film is great fun with really timeless humor. You can watch it again and again. There's no cursing or crude humor, so you don't have to be embarrassed to watch it with your kids or even your grandparents.

986929,"Surprisingly enough, the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is more enjoyable than the original.  The overall setting and plot are very similar.  A normal, lovable family is traveling through the Nevada desert.  Their vehicle breaks down and they are beset upon by cannibals.  However, the remake has more details (and I'm not referring to gore, although there is plenty) that make it a more realistic, faster paced thrill ride.  The opening scene is both shocking and horrifying.  The viewer soon realizes that this remake will be more violent than the original.Mild mannered cell phone retailer Doug Burkowski (Aaron Stanford of ""X-Men:  The Last Stand"") steals the film when he must turn into Rambo in order to get his baby back from the mutant cannibals who abducted her while his father-in-law was being roasted alive.  This lean, wiry built man kills a lot of tough mutants.  He also discovers a crater where dozens of vehicles have been stored - their owners slaughtered by mutants - and an eerie, fabricated town occupied by mannequins.  This is the town that the government was using for testing nuclear bombs.  Now it is occupied by hideously deformed, inbred miners who suffered radiation damage while hiding in the mines.The entire film has a creepy Twilight Zone atmosphere that wasn't found in the original.  Furthermore, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake was highly influenced by ""Wrong Turn,"" another film involving a cannibalistic family - this one living in the secluded woods of West Virginia.If you enjoy cannibalistic horror classics involving inbred families such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Wrong Turn,"" ""Raw Meat,"" etc., then you must see Wes Craven's remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes.""

1128449,"That quote, from novelist Dennis Lehane and taken from one of the ""making-of"" featurettes available on the DVD, pretty much sums up the whole point of ""Gone Baby Gone.""  I'll sum up the plot briefly: a child is kidnapped from the home of her crack-dealing single mother, and two private investigators are hired to find her.  What begins as a complicated case turns tragic, heartbreaking, and a moral issue for the ages.First of all: Ben Affleck can direct.  Sure, sure, he obviously takes his cues from the greats before him...but who doesn't?  Affleck takes a great script (which he co-wrote, based upon a great novel) and makes a great movie.  Boston becomes a central character; Affleck captures this by casting many true-life Boston citizens (as one ""actor"" states: ""There's no actors in there"") in many of the roles, giving the movie the lived-in feel that it requires.  Let's face it: despite the caliber of acting, despite the amazing script, if the movie didn't have Boston, the movie wouldn't have anything.Let's go back to the acting, because that's what drew me in.  Casey Affleck, Ben's little bro, is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors (see him also in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford;"" that movie, combined with this, will quickly erase any doubts about this man's talent).  As his girlfriend/partner, Michelle Monaghan oozes charm and charisma as always.  Amy Ryan, as the girl's mother, is a wonder to behold; she highly deserves her Best Supporting Actress nod (and if she wins, you won't hear any complaints from me).  It's unfortunate that Ed Harris, who delivers one of his best performances, isn't nominated; as a hard-hitting detective who isn't afraid to bend the rules, he steals every scene he's in.  Then there's Morgan Freeman; in the first half of the movie, his talent isn't readily evident (it's a bit hard to get past his traditional wise-man persona).  When he shows up later in the film, though, the viewer is quickly reminded why Freeman is one of the best actors to ever grace the screen.Ultimately, as intimated in the title line of this review, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a thinking-man's crime drama.  It isn't meant to leave you feeling nice and comfortable; it's meant to leave you shaken, edgy, as if something wasn't right.  What is ""the right thing?""  How do we know it when we see it?  How do we know it when we do it?  These are the questions you'll leave this movie with.  If you're not comfortable questioning your own humanity, then I reccommend going to see some other flick; I hear Paris Hilton has a new one coming out.  But if you don't mind feeling uncomfortable, if you don't mind watching a crime drama that is actually thought-provoking, then by all means watch this one.  You'll get your money's worth and a whole lot more.",N/A

1168464,"This release of ""Prom Night"" is its own movie that tries to be a horror. As others have mentioned, it is not a remake. If you like blood and gore in your movies then this is not the movie for you. Though the body count is high, there is no gore. I do not like movies that use blood and gore to make up for lack of good storyline, but I do love suspense. But even here the movie is lacking somewhat.The movie has some suspense, but nothing that will have you on the edge of your seat. This movie starts off slow with background, which we get from a nightmare, and builds from there to the climax. Though it is an OK film to see, I would suggest you wait and get it from your library. You will not lose much by watching it on the small screen. Though it is not as suspenseful as I would like, it has a somewhat realistic plotline and killer, and for that I added a star.",Prom Night

It's not so much a movie as it is a miniseries as it took a while to watch, but it is worth it, since miniseries are often able to put in more of the book than a movie whose time must be restricted.The acting, props, costumes, and background were all solid, and I have no complaint. It was especially fun to see Moll stare right into the camera. For me, that added some spice and fun to watch, especially when she looked at you while she was doing something naughty.

1092836,"After seeing Judd Apatow's hilarious smash comedy ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and hearing the great things about his follow-up movie, ""Knocked Up"", I looked forward to getting a chance to sit down and watch it. However, I seemed to never get around to watching ""Knocked Up"", the movie that many called `the best comedy of 2007', so I eventually just forgot all about it. That is until my wife and I caught the trailer on TV recently and we finally decided to go rent the movie and see if it could live up to all the hype that had been bestowed upon it since its release last year.""Knocked Up"" tells the story of Ben (Seth Rogen), a slacker who has nothing more on his mind than hanging out with friends and having a good time, and Alison (Katherine Heigl), a career woman who longs for bigger and better things to come so long as she can stay focused on the path she's set herself upon. Then, after an intoxicated one night stand, and two months and countless pregnancy tests later, Alison and Ben find themselves in for the surprise of their lives as they must prepare themselves to welcome a new bouncing bundle of joy into their world. Now these two complete opposites are trying to get to know each other and begin a relationship, figure out what they need for the baby, and above all else how to become two mature, responsible parents.Well, I guess the question is, did ""Knocked Up"" live up to all the hype that moviegoers built up around it, or was the weight of it all too much for it to handle? I would have to say that the movie successfully lived up to the hype with relative ease, as my wife and I laughed aloud numerous times throughout the movie, and easily enjoyed every minute of it. The story for ""Knocked Up"" was hilarious, often times crude, and surprisingly heartfelt several times throughout the movie. I liked that the story didn't solely rely on sight gags to get the laughs, it featured a smartly written script that was chock full of hilarious one-liners, and uncomfortable yet hilarious situations that can occur throughout pregnancy and child birth. Kudos to Judd Apatow for delivering a solid script that was not only incredibly funny, but was also serious at times to break up the proceedings without being too overly dramatic to distract from the fact that it was still a comedy. Some comedy writers are too scared to try for any actual drama within their story, which is fine as well; while others try to fit it in but fail to make the various elements gel properly. Which is what makes Judd such a great writer is that he knows how to make each of the components of his story work well with each other and seem natural within the overall movie.The cast was hilarious and fully capable of handling anything Judd Apatow's script could throw at them, and each created such fun and engaging characters that there was never a dull moment in the movie. Seth Rogen's (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") character of Ben was hilarious as we get to see how uncomfortable he is around kids, yet over time he matures into a more responsible adult who is essentially ready to do what is necessary as a parent to a newborn child. Katherine Heigl (TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"") brought a more serious character with Alison to balance out Ben's more outlandish behavior, though she wasn't without her moments of hilarity as well. Even though her character was much more mature from the start, she still had her own arc that took her from career-minded woman to a pregnant woman full of uncontrollable hormones who is struggling to keep her sanity amidst a somewhat dim-witted boyfriend, a controlling sister, and a job where her looks define her success, and eventually into a woman ready to welcome a child into the world with the man she loves, no matter how mismatched they may be. The supporting cast led by Paul Rudd (""40 Year Old Virgin""), Leslie Mann (""Drillbit Taylor""), and Jonah Hill (""Superbad"") were hilarious and made their characters just as memorable as the two leads. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann's married characters of Pete and Debbie were a possible glimpse into what the future held for Ben and Alison, which was a nice way to show the do's and don'ts of parenting and marriage. Jonah Hill was absolutely hilarious as the outspoken and opinionated Jonah, who is one of Ben's many slacker friends. Turning up in surprising cameos are actor/director Harold Ramis (""Analyze This"") and Joanna Kerns (TV's ""Growing Pains"") as Ben's dad and Alison's mom, I guess this just shows that a Judd Apatow movie will attract all different types of talent, so you never know what to expect.""Knocked Up"" is a hilarious, laugh out loud movie that easily lives up to the hype surrounding it, and did not disappoint in the least. I highly recommend watching ""Knocked Up"" if you're a fan of Judd Apatow or if you are a person who is not easily offended and is looking for a hilarious comedy that will keep you laughing from start to finish.""Knocked Up"" is available in rated R and unrated editions both contain language and nudity/sexuality.",Knocked Up

I struggle with the movie only because it's just not a happy/go lucky day at the movies.

129550,"The middle film in the original Indiana Jones trilogy is often seen as the weakest entry, and there is little to argue about that there.  The problem isn't that it is a poor film, but that its surrounding entries are fantastic, and looked at as two of some of the best movies of all time.  Both Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade succeed because not only does Indy go after some very interesting Biblical artifacts (The Ark and The Holy Grail), but he has to fight off a legion of Nazis in both films.  In Temple of Doom, Indy helps save a village from it's ruining fate in India by going after the Shankara Stones, stolen and held by a group known as the ""Thugi"" within Pancock Palace (spell?)  While the result is fun and indeed different than the other films, there is a noticable loss of plot excitement compared to Raiders and Crusade, along with other annoyances that keep this film below par compared to the others.Originality helps and hurts Temple.  As mentioned by many reviewers, the film is the darkest in the series, with scenes of sacrifice, children slaves, bug eating, and a scene of Mola Ram pulling out an innocent's heart.  The film is rated PG, but would definelty be PG-13 if it had been released after the PG-13 system came out a few years later.  The story isn't as interesting as Raiders and Last Crusade, but still remains interesting nonetheless, which gives the viewer much curiosity about this unusual religion that the Thugi practice.Indy's sidekick and girlfriend don't help much either.  Although Short Round has become an icon in the film over the years (one could argue), providing humor and lots of memorable one liners, he more or less drags pacing along, as well as Indy on his adventure.  Wily Scott is the most annoying girl of the 3 Indy films, and her acting isn't really all that teriffic, with her whining and complaining getting more on one's nerves than adding any humor which I belive to be the attempt.For some really good news, the action in Temple of Doom is incredible, and in my opinion some of the best of any Indy film.  The beginning of the film starts off with great pacing that never lets up until we reach the India village.  The scenes of sacrifice are highly entertaining, with crowds of Thugi cheering on to the beat of drums and Mola Ram holding the victim's burning heart in one hand while the victim is being lowered into a pit of fire (don't worry, it's actually more of a fun scene than disturbing).  But the most memorable scene is the mine cart chase that still looks impressive to date.  A fast and furious chase that seems to go on for quite a while, with unexpected and clever action along the way.  The film ends with the classic bridge scene, where Indy cuts the rope, splitting the bridge into two, high above a river of crocs.It's Indiana Jones, so in other words, its a great film.  The weakest and most annoying in the series, Temple of Doom still thrives off of originality and impressive action.  Despite the fact Ford's supporting actors are a little weak, he still gives us a great performance as always.[..]",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom VHS
841326,"After having lost everything, Rene (played by Felicity Mason) tries to leave her hometown of Berkeley but is unable to get out when the town is struck with a meteor shower. Instead of leaving giant craters and demolished buildings in their wake, these meteors leave something else: an infection that transforms humans into zombies.The town now overrun with the undead, Rene barely survives and meets up with Marion (played by Mungo McKay), the town nut who claimed he was abducted by aliens a long time before. Soon joined by others, the group of survivors find temporary solace in Marion's cabin before the dead come a'knockin' and force their way in.Blood and guts ensue as this band of not-so-merry-men try and fight their way through throngs of the undead and leave town.They almost make it, too, if not for that giant, spike-laden wall bordering the town, keeping everyone inside.This flick starts off as your run-of-the-mill zombie movie. Nothing wrong with that. Not at all. The blood, the guts, the guns--ah, yes, everything that makes up a good zombie flick. Even Marion's Matrix-like fighting style works well in the context of the story (though when that style was first introduced, I had a hard time buying it but quickly got used to it).What separates this zombie flick from all others I've seen is the twist it takes when we find out these aren't your standard zombies, but instead the product of ""something beyond,"" namely intergalactic stuff. Toss in a few aliens and you got yourself a unique zombie film that pays more homage to the zombie clich&eacute;s than actually follows them like a rulebook.This is an independent film and I only point that out because it being indy really added to the gritty feel of the whole thing, enhancing the movie. This didn't carry that too-smooth-yet-too-cheap look that B-movies have. Even the directors' love for the genre really shone through in this and the cast did a fantastic job.I can understand now why this movie got the cult following it did.If you dig good solid zombie flicks, check this one out.A.P.

692753,"""Dracula: The Dark Prince"": the title of this made-for-TV film is slightly misleading as it may make you think that the film is about vampires. It is not. Certainly the film stars Rudolf Martin as ""Vlad Dracula the Impaler"" or Prince of Romania (or Wallachia to be precise), one of the models of Count Dracula, but the story itself is not related to Bram Stoker's book or the blood-sucking Count himself. The film claims it is fact-based (and it is though very loosely), inspired by the real history of Vlad Dracula, often referred to as Vlad Tepes (Impaler).Raised by stern father, young Vlad and his brother Radu are later kidnapped and held hostage by the Turkish Sultan. After their father was murdered, only Vlad is allowed to go back to his country (reasons unexplained). Vengeful Vlad vows to free his country and brother Radu from the Turks and he enlists a financial help from Hungarian King Janos (Roger Daltrey). While staying at his court, he falls in love with King's daughter Lidia (Jane March) and marries her.All these incidents loosely based on the historical facts are told as memories of Vlad Dracula interrogated by Father Stefan (Peter Weller) and other priests trying to indict him for his atrocities. The short film includes many events, but as it is clearly low-budget, you cannot expect grand-scale battle scenes. But the film keeps slick storytelling which is not boring with convincing locations (shot in Romania, why not?) and the complex personalities of Vlad Dracula. I only wish that the film took more time to explore the meanings of his extremely harsh punishments as the ruler of the politically unstable country.""Dracula: The Dark Prince"" is not a horror film; it is more like a historical mini-series. It may not be as accurate as it claims, but it surely has a good story in it.",N/A

142550,"A massive, sprawling epic shot in the three camera Cinerama Process popular during the early 60's, ""How the West Was Won"" spans from 1830 to 1880 covering the history of the westward expansion. Directed by three directors (John Ford, Henry Hathaway and George Marshall with a fourth Richard Thorpe providing uncredited linking pieces)""How the West Was Won"" was produced during the twilight of the western as the most popular type genre.Warner has done a painstaking job of restoring this classic film and although it isn't perfect, it's an exceptional job that deserves kudos. The film has never looked this good with colors that pop and accurate fleshtones. More important the seams that one could see for the separate cameras aren't quite as glaring as before. The image quality is exceptionally crisp with terrific detail. Audio sounds extremely good with a nice 5.1 mix.The film is spread over two discs with the original Overture and Alfred Newman's marvelous score included as part of the package. We get a terrific feature length commentary track from  ""West"" stuntman Loren James who provides plenty of background details about the physical shooting of the film, filmmaker David Strohmaier, film scholar Rudy Behlmer, Cierama's John Sittig and music historian Jon Burlingame. My only complaint is that Burlingame will make a comment about listening to Newman's marvelous score and then whomever edited his comments continues to play them right over the music cue we should be listening to without interruption.The only other complaint that I have is that while the dirt and grit has been removed making the film look marvelous, there's one sequence that has always bugged me--there is a bit of dirt right in the middle of the frame of the opening fly over sequence that I wish they could have figured out how to remove. Other than that, it's pretty smooth looking throughout the presentation despite an occasiona bit of image unsteadiness as characters move across the screen and span of the three cameras lenses.We also get a terrific hour and a half documentary on the Cinerama process on the third disc.There are three different versions of the film in re-release: the first is a three disc DVD edition with just the film; the second is the three disc set postcards, a reproduction of the original press book, souvenir book and photos as part of the package;there is no equivalent for this SCE in the Blu-ray edition although it does have a booklet as part of that package.The image and sound quality in this restored edition improves on the original single disc edition of the film with a terrific commentary track and documentary to round out the set. With a stunning casts (James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Carolyn Jones, Debbie Reynolds, Carol Baker, Lee J.

256716,"On any list of the Ten Most Romantic Films Ever Made, ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"" will likely always be present. This beautiful 1947 black and white film by Joseph Mankiewiecz, with a gorgeous score by Bernard Herrmann (better known for the foreboding ones he did for Alfred Hitchcock), and marvellous performances by Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison, represents the best of post-War British romanticism.  It can only be described as - well, haunting.  Once seen, never forgotten, and pull out your handkerchiefs, you will need at least two.Gene Tierney plays Lucy Muir, an exquisite young widow with a little girl who moves to the seashore to get away from her late husband's domineering sister and mother.  Lucy's financial resources are limited, but she happens onto a house overlooking the sea that is surprisingly affordable - it appears the house has had trouble remaining occupied, due to ""disturbances"".  Lucy and her daughter fall in love with the house and move in, accompanied by Martha, their housekeeper.  Shortly afterward, Lucy is confronted by the source of the house's disturbances: its former owner, one Captain Gregg, a seaman who died in the house, and still considers it his.  He has chased out all subsequent owners and intends to do the same with Lucy, but she stands up to him defiantly, and lets him know that she will NOT be leaving and he can do as likes. He admires her spirit, and, having glimpsed her beauty (Ms. Tierney was surely at her most radiant in this film), he softens and agrees to share the house with her and her little family, although she asks him to refrain from contact with her little girl.  Captain Gregg is played by Rex Harrison at his most attractive, giving the role an irrisistible blend of charm, irony, and crustiness.A bantering but affectionate friendship develops between Lucy and Captain Gregg's ghost.  The Captain has clearly fallen for the new owner of the house, so much so that when Lucy's slender funds begin to run low and she confronts the possibility of losing the house she has come to love as much as he, Gregg dictates his very salty memoirs to her - they are published and become a best seller, ensuring Lucy's future.However, Captain Gregg eventually realizes that his presence in Lucy's life is preventing her from going out and meeting living men. Reluctantly, he decides to withdraw, and does so in a way that leaves Lucy no memory of Gregg's ""reality"", but rather a memory of an imaginary character that she dreamed and who then inspired the book.  After Gregg disappears, Lucy begins to go out into society, and almost immediately meets George Sanders - an experienced cad with whom she falls in love, only to find that he is married with several children.  The heartbroken Lucy retreats into solitude and decides that the only companionship she needs is her growing daughter, the loyal Martha, and the beloved house by the sea.Years pass, and Lucy's daughter grows up and becomes engaged to (naturally) a naval officer - when her daughter brings her fiance home, Lucy finds out that the little girl knew all about Captain Gregg and had frequent contact with him - something they both hid from Lucy.  More years pass, and now it is Lucy's granddaughter who is engaged to (naturally) a naval officer. Lucy and Martha have grown old together in the house, and, on a windswept night, the white-haired, tired Lucy passes quietly away in the great armchair in the Captain's old room - he suddenly appears before her and holds out his hands, and she springs up, young and beautiful again, and the two pass silently out into the briny night, finally able to live out the love they could not share while one of them still walked among the living.It sounds terribly soppy, but the script is of such high quality, the performances so note-perfect, the production so atmospheric, that the film never wanders into over-sentimentalization or saccharinity.  Its gentle romanticism recalls a lost era (alas, even Britain no longer makes films like this!) and, once seen, leaves an indelible memory.A five-star classic, and a must-have for fans of post-War British filmmaking of this genre.",N/A
1127806,"This is, in short, one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  It is well done and has a terrific cast.  Any movie w/Morgan Freeman in it automatically has its rating boosted by a star or so.  He's one of those actors who can stare into a camera for 5 minutes, say a 5 word sentence and you'll swear it was the most profound thing you've ever heard in your life.The film is about a social circle which consists of some very diverse people.  One is a college professor on sabbatical (Freeman), one is a cafe owner (Greg Kinnear) while two characters are employees of the cafe (Billy Burke & Alexa Davalos).  The plot is not focused, but to me that's a good thing.  It is like an overview of ""everyday lives"" of people within the circle.Kinnear's character is a poster boy for the mantra that nice guys finish last.  His persona's luck with women is almost as bad as mine.  He's a great person who always means well, but his downfall is that he's also incredibly naive.  He is intelligent, but he is prone to either over-interpreting minor events or being oblivious to major events which transpire in his life.  Freeman's character is a sort of mentor for him, but at times he appears to be a lost soul.There are some profound philosophical themes in the film which are downright Schopenhauresque.  In addition, there is also an allusion (deliberate or not) to a scene from Jean Paul Satre in which a character puts a nail through his hand just so he can feel something, or to see if he can feel @ all.Many viewers are likely to contend that the film is filled with gratuitous nudity.  I would disagree.  While I've never been opposed to nudity in films (and never will be!), there are some movies I've seen where the nudity was contrived.  Not so in this film.Rather, to me, the nude scenes are realistic.  Alexa Davalos and Radha Mitchell are very beautiful, to be sure, but they surely weren't cast for this film as eye-candy. [Mitchell reminds me a lot of Denise Crosby, BTW]  The scenes in which they strip down do(!) flow with the trajectory of the story.  In my mind, this movie is, quite simply, brutally honest.  Yes, it IS possible for 2 people to get caught in compromising positions.  Yes, it is also possible for 2 people to get into a big argument after making love.  In such a circumstance, it would be contrived for the couple to put their clothes on so they could continue arguing.  It's just like in so many flicks I've seen where two people make love & in the next scene it shows them still in bed, but miraculously w/their underwear on.  Everyone knows such scenes are nonsense.  This movie, for one, doesn't pander to such unrealistic scenes.I would invite the people who gave this 3 stars or less to give it another view. I truly believe that this is one movie where there is more than meets the eyes.  It is about love, to be sure, but it goes beyond Romantic love to also include the love involved with parenting issues as well.  The characters are complex and, with the exception of one lone character, they can't be placed into categories of ""good"" and ""evil.""  The film also accurately details how a couple that has broken up can(!) in fact remain friends - provided that the conditions are just right.  Normally, Radha Mitchell's character would be your typical femme fatale, but this DVD gets beyond that typical pigeonhole.I realize I've mumbled quite a lot, but this is a very difficult film to critique.  Not because it's bad, but because there are so many different angles to it.  I do believe that anyone looking for an honest, sincere account of love & relationships will be stirred by the present film.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I will run add this one to my all-time-favorites Amazon list.",N/A

Finlay & Hornswoggle V. Jesse & Festus V. Curt Hawkins & Zach RyderOk opener here. It was below average from where I sit, but it's watchable I guess. Nothing worth spending alot of time on. Hawkins & Ryder win the titles. **WWE United States Championship:Matt Hardy (Champion) V. Shelton Benjamingood match here. good wrestling too. I have always been a Shelton fan and I was glad to see him win the title here in a good match that told a good story, but there really wasn't any build-up so it's bitter sweet. Shelton wins!!! *** I saw Shelton wrestle at a house show last weekend and he looked a little lazy in the ring. Like, he really didn't want to be there. I hope that doesn't hurt his chances on getting a championship push anytime soon.ECW Championship:Mark Henry (Champion) V. Tommy Dreamerumm...SQUASH....Herny wins...DUD. Pointless ending with Colin turning on Dreamer because Dreamer didn't even have the match won...or was he even close to having it won so...Shawn Michaels V. Chris Jerichovery, very, good and emotional match here. Jericho plays the ruthless heel to perfection and Michaels plays the gutsy wrestler trying to fight his way though injury. Jericho wins because the ref stops the match for Michaels well-being. ***3/4 Jericho is the best heel in the company right now and his Title win at Unforgiven was a shocker, but I think it will be good (even if I am a CM Punk fun).Match to Determine the First Ever Diva's Champion:Michelle McCool V. Natalyanot a good match at all. Natalya is a better worker than Michelle, but she just didn't have it here. McCool wins the title, but only cause she is dating Taker. *World Heavyweight Championship:CM Punk (Champion) V. BatistaGood match here with the psychology being that Batista is too strong and Punk is a fluke champion. They have a good match that keep me interested for the whole thing. I really don't like the ending here because Kane comes down and causes a double DQ but there was really no follow up and I think Punk should have gotten the clean win here to prove that he wasn't a fluke, but good match either way. ***1/4New York City Parking Lot Brawl:John Cena V. JBLok...first of all, they weren't in NYC, but long island. Second, it wasn't even in a parking lot. Third, there were TOO MANY big spots and not enough selling of those spots to make this match. Fourth, all but the end was taped the night before, so some of the ""magic"" that live TV has was gone. The right man won and that was...JBL. **3/4WWE Championship:Triple H (Champion) V. Edgevery good match. I think this match could have been better, but the storyline actually hurt the match in my eyes. They really didn't build up to the match. All there was was the stupid wedding thing. Triple H wins. ***3/4I really think that last year's was a better event. It was more solid and it had better matches and storylines, but this year's wasn't too bad. Jericho/Michaels was match of the night and the two World titles match was pretty good (I don't think of the ECW Championship as a world championship anymore, WWE has made it into a second Intercontinental title).",N/A
1123851,"Like the central protagonist, this 2007 movie is a misbegotten mess. Making his directorial debut, actor Justin Theroux gets carried away with every film school trick in the book with self-conscious camerawork, annoying jump cuts and a music soundtrack that apparently has to comment on every scene. With a strangely cryptic first-time screenplay by David Bromberg, the movie boasts an impressive cast that includes Tom Wilkinson and Dianne Wiest, but it asks us to empathize with an obsessive-compulsive misanthrope whose actions alienate everyone around him. The ploy is too challenging since the character is more cruel than unfiltered, and his relentless bitterness rarely crackles with the wit necessary to get away with such boorish behavior. Moreover, subsequent attempts to humanize him feel increasingly contrived as the story progresses.The story revolves around Henry Roth, a prickly, phobic children's book author (an intentionally ironic profession for such an uncaring jerk) who bonds only with his longtime collaborator, a curmudgeonly illustrator named Rudy. They finally achieve success with a book about Marty the Beaver's campaign to save Christmas, but then Rudy dies. Henry's poker-faced editor, Arthur Planck, wants a sequel and consequently hires a young artist named Lucy to take Rudy's place. Lucy has her share of problems - a mother who is also her landlord and willing to evict her, and an errant lover named Jeremy who wants her back after dumping her. The movie's title is derived from the dedication to Lucy in Jeremy's about-to-be-published book. Motivated by a large bonus offered by Planck, Lucy is willing to subject herself to Henry's nasty comments, but of course, a romance develops. This is where the film falters badly as the love story is sketchily developed with little discernible chemistry between the two stars.The cast provides whatever redeeming value the film has. The usually audacious Billy Crudup does what he can as Henry, but it's an uphill battle. Better here than in last year's execrableBecause I Said So, Mandy Moore brings a certain poignancy to her scenes, but her downbeat character is so depressing that the only logical response to their romance is indifference. Wilkinson easily steals his scenes as Rudy both pre- and post-mortem, while Bob Balaban plays Planck in his typically low-key fashion. Wiest plays Lucy's mother in just a couple of tersely acted scenes, while Amy Sedaris, Peter Bogdanovich, Christine Taylor and Bobby Cannavale show up in cameos. The 2008 DVD is bereft of any extras, not even the theatrical trailer, which gives you an indication of what the studio thought of its prospects.",Dedication
1150114,"The Visitor is an excellent film. Richard Jenkins plays Walter, a widower that is attempting to fill the void his beautiful classical music piano player wife has left in his life.Walter is a loner, a quiet and introspective man with a heart of gold, who is pondering the meaning of life as he confronts brutal loneliness. The movie starts with him taking piano lessons from a teacher who tries to teach him as if he were a child, without understanding the desperate need Walter has for connection to a lost love through musical notes, so he dismisses her and we see in his eyes the detachment he experiences because nothing that surrounds him is important anymore.Walter is asked to travel to New York City to deliver a paper presentation on a book he did not even write, he simply co-authored it at the request of the real writer. Reluctantly, he accepts and arrives at his NYC apartment, where he has not visited for quite sometime, to find it occupied by total strangers, renting from a person he does not even know. Little does Walter know that these people are about to change his life, to turn his world around, to inspire him with purpose, to produce in him all the emotions he is longing to again experience: love, joy, laughter, pain, anger, tears and the exhilarating knowledge of how to play drums.As he helps others, Walter is simply helping himself to regain a purpose in life, to transform into being alive again, and to rediscover that he is capable of deep passions. Walter feels acceptance and finds that he is not alone in the world, that his pain, in variations, is felt by others. Simply a fabulous film that will delve into subjects that are close to most people's hearts. Don't miss it!!!",N/A

It could be that it was weird for me to see Lorelai married, she just seems like she is better off single. Most of the storylines this season are good, but some just don't sit well with me. I guess I just don't like David Rosenthal's storylines and ideas as much as Amy Sherman-Palladino's. Season seven does have its moments, but some of the other seasons are funnier or have better storylines, or both. If you have to know what happened, you should get season seven.

I found the three ""Pegasus"" episodes and the abrasive, ruthless Admiral Cain to be high points of the second season.

303777,"This is a powerful, surreal and frightening film. Like Deliverance, It's mostly about the very thin veneer of civilization. Shot in a cinema verite style, the brutality and horror seems almost documentary like, unlike Deliverance where there are practically signposts saying ""meaning here"", this film allows the horror and absurdity of itself unfold itself slyly around the edge of the frame. (consider the brilliant satire of having the surgeons chant ""take him apart! take him apart!"" as they dance around the campfire. And the eerie shot of the forest dwelling killer standing on top of the hill, a shadow against the sun.)Wheras Deliverance was all about northern white guilt, the doctors in this film have something to be guilty about. I think ""Rituals"" is great but the film reveals it's limitations, it's lack of guts, and it's prettifying of nature. Ultimately ""Deliverance"" is a superior film.",Rituals VHS
517736,"Time has given this controversial movie its audience. It nearly accidentally killed Boyle and it severed his relationship with Ewan Mcgregor*check IMDB for more details. It's a great film for anyone familiar with Danny Boyle; a director who is not happy with giving backstories. This is more obvious in his zombie reinvention genre 28 days later where he puts you 28 days later, literally. Leaving you to pick up your survival knowledge as you tumble along with the proctagonist. Here, he starts things off with Daffy, a shady man who speaks of a mysterious beach isolated from the sea. We never understand why he was outcasted from the island, nor his circumstances. But that's Boyle's style. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Richard, an American who doesn't know metrics and is in permanent seek of the ultimate sensation. Boyle always has an electronic, synthesizer soundtrack. John Murphy more popularly. But in this film it is a mix of cover songs and a few original songs by numerous artists. None by John Murphy to my dissapointment. Tilda Swinton makes a surprising cameo as Sal. Sal is that demented advocate who believes in the community as a check or balance that is beyond necessary, mandated is more like it. We push forward into the reality of the beach and in the end we are TORN out of paradise. I suppose there is no other way to be expelled from paradise but to be forced out, torn out. This is a great movie to further your knowledge of a very gifted director. Listening to his commentary is the best part. His lecture to the end really establishes his many choices for this controversial movie.",N/A

With fast-paced and witty dialogue the show is one of those that will be cherished and, now, sadly missed. This review will be centered on the DVD itself instead of the show though.The DVD packaging is rather good for a show. The discs are double sided, but episodes are not presented in widescreen. Inside is a booklet containing episode descriptions and a list of characters. On the flaps are lists of awards the show received in its first season as well as a list of special features. The special features including ""Making of's..."" and a gag reel as well as a few other treats. The audio commentaries are rather well done with Sorkin appearing on pretty much all of them.If you are a fan of the show you will not be disappointed by this release.",The West Wing: Season 1
446237,"Allen has said on more than one occasion that he doesn't have the stuff to be a director/writer of the caliber of Bergman or Fellini.  But in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" he comes up to the task.  The film isn't just one of Allen's best (I'm comfortable with saying it's the very best he's ever made, except for the fact that, because Allen works in at least three genres, it's difficult to compare and contrast his films).  In my judgment, it's one of the finest films in American cinema.The film is really cut from the same cloth as the medieval passion play.  It explores themes that involve morality and God.  In a godless universe, does it make any sense to talk about right or wrong?  In a universe in which there might be a god, but one who's apparently indifferent to us, are we free to act as we wish?  Allen's conclusion seems to be not unlike Albert Camus' in The Myth of Sisyphus:  the universe may or may not be godless, but it is absurd.  Bad guys (as personified by Martin Landau's character) do what they do without apparent retribution or punishment, but may not be easy with their gains.  Good guys (as personified by Woody Allen's character) do what they do without apparent reward or acclaim, and may be just as uneasy.  Most of us are simply too self-absorbed and witless (Alan Alda's character) to know that, in the end, everybody loses.A bleak image of human existence, perhaps.  But (as in Bergman's worldview), it's lightened by fleeting moments of grace:  falling in love, moments of wonderment and happiness, relating to young people.  We all may be losers in the end, but that needn't make life totally miserable.Performances in the film, especially Alan Alda's and Martin Landau's, are superb.  The only exception is Angelica Huston's wooden performance.  But insofar as she's got to be one of the most overrated actors in the business, one doesn't expect more from her, and thus is never really disappointed.Easily five stars.",N/A

1173436,"This movie tries to be a conservative version of Michael Moore, and fails miserably.  This movie might be ignored or simply laughed at if it weren't a symptom of the scientific illiteracy in the US.  Among the many failings and falsehoods of this movie are:1. It misrepresents the cases of the people supposedly ""expelled"". (They weren't)2. It displays stunning ignorance of evolution by natural selection (EBNS) and the evidence for it.3. It fails to present any case whatsoever for creationism or its politically-correctly renamed iteration, ""Intelligent Design.""4. The producers approached the scientists who participated under false pretenses.  And they then edited the interviews with these scientists to make them look foolish or sinister.5. It tries to smear EBNS and scientists generally with some completely unsupported connection to the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany. (This ham-handed and disgusting tactic is what drew the most fire from critics.)6. It fails to present the thousands of working scientists, including biologists such as Ken Miller, who are also firm believers in some kind of personal deity.Please search the web for expelledexposed to get the real story behind this movie and the supposedly ""expelled"" academics.  They were not ""expelled""; and this movie spreads bald lies about their situations.  Please also see the NOVA program ""Judgment Day"" about the Dover, PA trial of ID-creationism for the real story of ID (it is religion, not science:  even a conservative GW Bush appointee could clearly see that.)For the record and in accordance with items 2 and 5 above:  Nazi Germany's eugenics, like all eugenics plans, was an artificial selection program, determined by humans.  This is completely different from natural selection.  (Not survival of the fittest; but rather survival of those who are politically-favored.)  And, even if Hitler had invoked Charles Darwin as some kind of justification for his evil deeds (he didn't), he STILL would have been misunderstanding Darwin's idea of EBNS.  Darwin drew a crystal clear distinction between artificial human selection (in for instance the breeding of pigeons and livestock) and the workings of natural selection.  If you read, ""On the Origin of Species"" you will discover that for yourself.In addition:  ID is not science. I've read Behe and Dembski and other ID cdesign proponentsists [sic:  see Of Pandas and People]. They have but a single argument to make (they have no theory, no experiments, no data, no results) and I will summarize it: [Biological feature X] is too complicated for me to understand how it could have evolved, therefore God had to have done it, QED. This is simply a non sequitur. William Dembski's, my, or your lack of intellectual skills or knowledge neither requires nor implies anything about the nature of reality. A federal judge has ruled in detail that ID is religion. Magic explains nothing*. Magic is not science. Incredulity is not science: it is IGNORANCE. Science DISPELS ignorance by hypothesis and testing to find out the FACTS in the case.  (* If magic is allowed, then ANY effect can be equally well asserted to follow ANY cause; all rules of logic and evidence fail, and no conclusions can be drawn.)Why were film clips of Nazi Germany and concentration camps included in this film?  Ben Stein gives us the answer: In an interview with the Trinity Broadcasting Network, Ben Stein said the following amazing things in an interview with Paul Crouch, Jr.Stein: When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers [i.e. biologist P.Z. Myers], talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed ... that was horrifying beyond words, and that's where science - in my opinion, this is just an opinion - that's where science leads you.Crouch: That's right.Stein: ...Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.Crouch: Good word, good word.That's your Ben Stein. That's what this film is about: trying to discredit science. You know, the discipline that brought you: vaccination, modern medicine, antibiotics, anesthesia, air travel, air conditioning, satellites, cell phones, modern agriculture, safe buildings and bridges. Who needs science?I strongly recommend that you save your money and spend it instead on, for instance:  Neil Shubin's ""Your Inner Fish,"" Matt Ridley's ""Genome,"" of Jared Diamond's ""The Third Chimpanzee.""",Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed

Set in the final days of the Boer War, Three Australian Soldiers are tried by a British court-martial for the killing of Boer Prisoners and a German Missionary. Filmed in flash back the story shows the soldiers actions leading to their arrest, with guilt being in the eyes of the beholder.The films relevence is how the policy of Nations often is leveled on the shoulders of the men in the field. Accutely showing how soldiers serving under extreme circumstances, and often judged by civil law, societies expectations, and governments desire to save face, in unpopular situations. With our countries divided views of the Iraq war, and the conduct of our serving men, this story is as relavent today as it was then.So if the idea of a ""War Movie"" puts you off, this film just might convert you. Much like Stanley Kubricks ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Inherit the Wind, it is court room drama at its finest. Winner of 10 Australian films awards, it should be added to the best films ever made.",N/A

It has a certain modern sensibility that could be interesting if it didn't clash so badly with most of the tone of the movie. Marie Antoinette is not as bad as the critics said, or as the horrendous trailer seemed to indicate, but overall it's a disappointment.",Marie Antoinette

It managed to scare, thrill and keep me glued to the screen. Excellent story, characters, scenery, just about everything. A classic horror film.",N/A

I returned it because all it was was Season One Box Set and Season Two Single Container in a special box made to house the two.  I already had bought the two same identical seasons.  I didn't need to pay $50.00 for cardboard that was housing the two that I had already  ordered.  I don't like being mislead and I'm sure everybody out there doesn't like it either.",Jericho - The Complete Series

810434,"Getting into the BABYLON 5 universe can be confusing for newcomers.  To see everything you really need the DVDs in this box as well as all of the individual B5 movies and the single-season series CRUSADE.  I'm going to give a simplified chronology.  You can make it even more precise by putting one movie in between two episodes of a single season, but I don't think you gain too much by doing that.  Except for THE GATHERING and A CALL TO ARMS, none of the movies rigidly require to be viewed at a particular point.First watch BABYLON 5: THE GATHERING from this boxed set.  To be blunt, it is not very good at all.  It is basically a pilot and not an especially compelling one.  We meet some -- but by no means all -- of the important characters of forthcoming seasons, and get a taste of the B5 universe, but this is just a dull, chatty, uninteresting debut.  And the make up for G'Kar looked like it was in planning stages!  Very, very different from how he looked on the subsequent series.Next, watch Seasons One through Four of BABYLON 5 the series.  The first season is slightly more interesting than the pilot, but not by much.  Season Two gets slightly more interesting, especially near the end of the season when the Shadows plot really kicks into gear.  From this point to the end of Season Four B5 is incredibly compelling.  Just be patient watching the first two seasons.  You'll start getting hints in Season Two of how good it will eventually get, but there will still be plenty of dullish episodes instead.  The series is not terribly balanced because the network changed its plans a couple of times, first telling Straczynski that the series was going to wrap up at the end of Season Four and then, after he had collapsed two season's worth of stories into one, telling him that the show would be renewed for one more season.  So much for planning.Next, before watching Season Five, watch another movie in this set, IN THE BEGINNING.  This is far and away the best of the B5 movies and is fully as good and as entertaining as Seasons Three and Four.  It goes back before the beginning of the series, giving the details of the Minbari was.  But the narrative assumes you've seen the first four seasons.Next, watch Season Five of BABYLON 5.  Because he really had a different story arc planned for Season Five one had to be created pretty quickly.  The whole telepath arc simply never caught fire and it does not represent the best of B5.  The last third of the season focuses on the decline and fall of Centauri Prime and this is B5 at its best.  There are a string of very, very good episodes as well as a very beautiful series finale.  Mention must also be made of a lovely episode in the first half of the season written by the great Neil Gaiman.Season Five was actually broadcast in split seasons and a couple of the movies -- THIRDSPACE and RIVER OF SOULS -- were broadcast before the series actually finished.  Your call.  Neither is all that great and neither really requires to be seen at a certain point.The next movie, however, BABYLON 5: A CALL TO ARMS, should be viewed after the end of the series and the previously mentioned movies, and before the series CRUSADE.  This episode features Bruce Boxleitner very prominently as Sheridan and is probably his last great hurrah in the series.  The movie introduces the new and highly advanced space ship Excalibur and deals with a Drakh attack on earth, infecting it with a slow-acting virus that will kill all life on earth if a cure is not found (but since B5 the TV series gave us multiple glimpses into the future, we know that doesn't happen).  This required the need for a search for a cure for the virus, a search that was continued on the quickly cancelled CRUSADE.  The show never really got off the ground, but it had some interesting characters (especially Galen, played by Peter Woodward, who also appeared in the films A CALL TO ARMS and LOST TALES).  I do recommend that fans of B5 see CRUSADE.The next movie was THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS: TO LIVE AND DIE IN STARLIGHT.  Horrible.  This is the worst of all the B5 movies, the worst thing ever done in the entire run of the show.  I honestly don't even recommend this for fans of the show.  The most I can say in support of it is that it is one's last chance to see Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar.  He died a couple of years later of lung cancer.Last, and not quite least, there is 2007's THE LOST TALES.  It is definitely not as bad as THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS, but not as good as IN THE BEGINNING.  My reaction was that it was nice to see some familiar characters again (mainly just Tracy Scoggins's Captain Lochley, Bruce Boxleitner's Sheridan, and Peter Woodward's Galen).  But definitely not B5 at its best.  Most fans describe it as ""chatty.""  There are entire scenes devoted to nothing but talk, and not terribly good talk at that.A lot to see.  For me the heart consists of the end of Season Two, all of Seasons Three and Four, the movie IN THE BEGINNING, and the last third of Season Five.  My advice to anyone newly approaching B5 is to stick it out through it all.  Much of it is dull, some of it even downright bad, but the best is very good indeed.  If you are patient, you will find your patience rewarded.",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series
823975,"I am confused, the description states the set has captions but several reviews claim it doesn't. Does it or doesn't it have captions? I don't understand why anyone would issue a DVD without captions. I am 70 and have problems understanding the dialogue in many of today's movies. My wife and I saw The DeVinci Code in a theater and I couldn't understand what the female lead was saying most of the time because of her mumbling. It wasn't until I got the DVD that I could understand what she was saying. I enjoy English TV shows like Midsomer Murders and have bought several sets but because I couldn't access the captions, I haven't watched them because of the accents. I generally have less trouble understanding the dialogue in older movies which don't have much background noise like traffic, etc.",Jane Austen Collection: (Sense & Sensibility / Emma / Persuasion / Mansfield Park / Pride & Prejudice / and more)
