895893,"This movie got a shudder out of me before it even started. I saw thelogo for The Asylum come up and I knew immediately that I was in for 90minutes of cheap, irritating horror film-making. I've come to associatethat logo with some of the worst genre movies ever. Worse than RogerCorman's Concorde label, worse than Avi Lerner's NuImage, worse thanCharlie Band's Full Moon... yes, even worst than Lloyd Kaufman's Tromalabel. The Asylum is, hands down, the worst cheap movie horror outfitin the history of cinema in my opinion. So, as I said, the logo came upand I shuddered involuntarily. But that was the only scare of the wholemovie.The Asylum is true to form with ALIEN ABDUCTION. The early scenes of acrew of campers out in the woods are poorly lit, poorly acted andpoorly edited. About ten minutes in, our hiking quartet is attacked bya bunch of lizard-alien-monster things. It looks like the suit camefrom a B-movie clearance house. It might have been a leftover Godzillasuit for all I know. The filmmakers apparently knew that the suit wasridiculous because they coated it with bad CG prismatic colors. Haven'tseen that done since ""Darkhunters"".So after the alligator aliens capture our hikers by throwing stuffedpantyhose at them (I'm not kidding - watch the movie), the screen goesblack for a second and then we meet our four hikers again inside thealien spaceship. Our female protagonist keeps filming everything withher Handicam to give the movie that ""real"" quality. Because so often,when I'm abducted by alligator aliens, I feel the need to capture thewhole experience for posterity. They try to escape, the alligatoraliens catch them and eviscerate them, throwing intestines all over theplace with bloody glee.Cut to some sort of Government Secret Hospital. Our heroine is the onlyone to have survived the experience and she has no memory of whathappened to her. Her doctor tries to jog her memory with pictures ofaliens and flying saucers, but to no avail. Meantime, Ilsa the She-Wolfwatches from behind the mirror and makes all kinds of arch statementslike, ""I don't like her. Terminate her."" The doctor begs for just alittle more time. Our heroine manages to escape from her captors andher clothes several times over the course of the movie. After an hour,I had seen the heroine's breasts so often that I was starting tomemorize her freckles.So our heroine runs around, taking off her shirt, trying to avoidaliens and help her friends (who are in fact alive!) escape from theinstitution. But when she finally faces off with Ilsa, guess what....she's not really a human at all! In a startling reveal that you willnot see coming if you sleep through the first hour, we find out thatour heroine is actually an alien sleeper agent! At this point, themovie tries to become a poor man's version of Impostor - but if PhillipK. Dick heard me say that, he'd probably roll in his grave. Obviouslysomebody at the Asylum watched the Gary Sinise/Dimension version ofImpostor and thought, ""Let's do that, but with alligator men! We'llcall it Alien Impostor! No, wait, that will give away the twist.... howabout ALIEN ABDUCTION!""",Alien Abduction
6185,"OK, so I'll admit that Brad Pitt's accent is not perfect and there's no way any IRA man would be that pretty (imagine if Brad Pitt looked like Gerry Adams - I doubt he would get as many roles). But the accent is actually not that bad, and Belfast people do actually say ""foks sake"" quite frequently.I agree there are some dubious moments in the plot and that the action scenes are a little far fetched, but hey, this is Hollywood, and there is enough of a ""gritty realism"" feel imparted elsewhere to distract the viewer from these minor inconsistencies.Harrison Ford plays the same character he played in Patriot Games / Air Force 1 / The Fugitive, which is fine by me since I enjoyed all those movies and I am a big Harrison fan.I didn't find the plot partucularly confusing (it's pretty straightforward really). And although I certainly wouldn't venture to say that the script delivers chapter and verse on the hellishly complicated political situation in N. Ireland, it does at least go some way to explaining the mechanisms (personal revenge, indoctrination) that drive the cycle of violence there.And the bittersweet ending has the desired effect.",N/A
948265,"The seventh season of the Simpsons saw Matt Groening's prime time, brilliantly hilarious animated series not missing a single step.  As this season opens, we learn who shot Mr. Burns (and honestly, who didn't see it coming?), and everything from that point forward is nothing but memorable, whimsical, and often insane humor that only the Simpsons could bring.  Also in this season, Hollywood comes to Springfield to film a Radioactive Man movie, and Millhouse ends up getting cast as sidekick Fallout Boy (""Radioactive Man""), Homer and Marge get accused of being negligent parents and Bart, Lisa, and Maggie get sent to live with the Flanders' (""Home Sweet Home-Dum-Diddly Doodly""), Bart sells his soul for five dollars (""Bart Sells His Soul""), Lisa becomes a vegetarian after attending a petting zoo (""Lisa the Vegetarian"", which also features Paul and the late Linda McCartney as themselves), Homer becomes morbidly obese so he doesn't have to go to work (""King-Size Homer""), Homer is re-united with his long lost mother (voiced by Glenn Close in ""Mother Simpson""), Sideshow Bob returns with a vendetta against television (""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming""), former President George Bush moves next door (the hilarious and unpredictable ""Two Bad Neighbors""), Bart meets the real creator of Itchy & Scratchy (voiced by Kirk Douglas in ""The Day the Violence Died""), Pulp Fiction gets hilariously spoofed (""22 Short Films About Springfield""), and Homer becomes a sideshow freak after going to Lolapalooza (""Homerpalooza"", which also features the Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, and Peter Frampton).  The ""Treehouse of Horror"" special this season was also a memorable smash, climaxing with Homer's unforgettable journey into the 3-D world.  ""The Simpsons 138th Show Spectacular"" is a real gem, hosted by Troy McClure (voiced by the late, great Phil Hartman) as we the viewer are treated to rarely seen early takes of the characters, alternate endings, and deleted scenes that never saw the light of day, as well as some hidden messages and trivia as well.  All in all, just like all the early seasons of the Simpsons, you can't go wrong with the seventh season, and it's pure animated lunacy at it's very best.  Let's just hope that the packaging is much better than the incredibly poorly designed Homer head shaped package that contained season six.",The Simpsons - The Complete Seventh Season
286123,"In a few short words,I just want to say how wonderful and entertaining this movie is.  I have had it on tape for years,now that it is on DVD I will treasure it.  I wish most critics would not hamper on about ""Historical Inaccuracies"" etc and just let us,the public decide for ourselves.  The movie never intended to be accurate and Raoul Walsh the director had a knack of bringing tension through great rousing set-pieces.  Along with ""Robin Hood"" and ""Objective Burma"" ""Boots"" is my favourite Flynn movie",N/A
862431,"The only reason I'm writing this review is because the trailer is misleading, and you may think you are picking up a psycho thriller, when you are really picking up a romantic drama.Let's put it this way, when my wife and I were discussing whether to get it, I was advocating for it, and she was against it.  After it was over, she liked it better than I did.From a marketing perspective, I think the promoters did not want this to come out as a chick flick, and they wanted young men to buy into it, but I think that blurred the movie's appeal and confused its audience.  It would have done much better if it was targeted more directly and squarely at women 18-35.  If you are in this core demographic, you should like this movie.  If you are dating someone in this core demographic, you will definitely be able to stand it, and may even enjoy it.",Wicker Park
402584,"The Sound of Music is a movie that rightfully earned so many superlatives from the moment it premi&egrave;red in 1965 that almost as soon as it came out, people were also creating spoofs, making fun of the movie. Interestingly enough, Julie Andrews, together with Carol Burnett, created a spoof on The Sound of Music in a Carnegie Hall appearance long before she made the film, and she was as spectacular in that performance as she was in The Sound of Music. The film is now a classic, and it has been immortalized now on DVD.If I have one critique of the home version, it is that a film such as The Sound of Music was created for the wide screen and simply cannot be displayed in all its magnificence on a small screen. In the opening when the audience views the Austrian Alps and sees the spectacular scenery, those views are so breathtaking on the expanses of the big screen but look so miniscule on a television screen and jokingly small on a DVD screen or computer monitor, so my preference remains to see this film on a large screen with surround sound; it preserves the true magnificence of the film as I remember it originally. However, nothing can really ruin this film; even taken in microcosm, the film is still a masterpiece to behold.Julie Andrews is a natural in the character of the hapless postulate Maria who can never really fit in as a future nun and ends up becoming the governess at the von Trapp estate. Christopher Plummer assumes the role of Captain von Trapp very convincingly. It turns out that the two did not get along so well, and the love song ""Something Good"" had to be shot in silhouette to hide the fact that they were definitely not amorous with one another in the slightest, but the two play their parts with flair all the way to the end. Eleanor Parker as Baroness von Schrader is a perfect foil to Maria when she shows up for a visit and says, ""My dear, is there anything you can't do?"" Richard Hayden is charming as the amoral entrepreneur Max Detweiler who books the children into the festival and, ultimately, is responsible for enabling the family to escape from the Nazis. Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess plays a very small part but gets to sing the immortal Climb Every Mountain that is, in many ways, the turning point for Maria in the film.The children, of course, get quite a bit of the attention as Maria came to care for them. The critics often commented that it was less than convincing that all the children seemed to get along so well without fighting, without having to go to the bathroom or having a runny nose -- well, somehow things like those DID seem to get left out, but in the span of the movie, just how much were they supposed to include and still get in the entire Rodgers and Hammerstein score? The score is such an impressive part of the movie, and the choreography with the children is so well staged -- don't forget that the children were growing during the film, so it was necessary to make adjustments for the changes in height -- that it's important to appreciate the film's many virtues. Note that in the song Do Re Mi, the song covers many different scenes and locations; a lot could have gone on in the interim!I always found the performance of Charmian Carr to be rather shallow, so it never surprised me that her career ended with this film; many people argued that an ingenue doesn't need to be able to act, but I always argued that she does if she wants to continue acting! Heather Menzies certainly did, as did Nicholas Hammond and Angela Cartwright; of course, Angela Cartwright was already well known to American audiences from television when she did the film.So much can be said about the film, but one thing I can say that says it all: you'll definitely enjoy it. It's probably the happiest film ever made, and you'll enjoy watching it throughout. If you are the sort of person who likes being happy and likes watching happy films, this is the film for you. Great music, beautiful scenery, and a happy story with a happy ending. How can you go wrong with that?",N/A

I am sad to see this series come to an end, but I loved the ending.  I would SO love to see CLAMP produce a Chobits II: Followup.Episode 23:  Chi Answers - Minoru, ""Dragonfly"" (Chi's repentant and chastisted kidnapper), and a bevy of Persocoms are hard at work trying to discover Chi's origin once and for all.  It is fairly certain Chi is one of the legendary ""Chobits,"" but in seeking confirmation, Minoru's favorite Persocom, Yuzuki, is damaged in a hacking attempt.  In exploring the nature of Minoru and Yuzuki's relationship, Hideki starts to analyze his true feelings toward Chi.Episode 24:  Chi Decides - This episode is mostly about Yumi, and her past relationship with Hiroyasu Ueda, the bakery manager where Chi works.  As revealed in a previous episode, Ueda was deep in love with and actually married to a Persocom.Episode 25:  Chi Puts on and Takes Off - The true origins of Chi and Freya (Dark Chi)are revealed here.  Hideki tries to confess his feelings to Chi.  But the two mysterious Persocoms have decided to act, because Chi poses great danger to all Persocoms.Episode 26:  The Only Person for Chi - Chi activates, with glowing eyes.  Dita tries to stop Chi.  What will happen to Chi and Hideki?Note: There IS a volume 7 for the series - but don't get excited!  There is little, if any new material on it.

914933,"Taylor Brandon Burns (Mark Rendall) is a 12-year-old star known for his role on a popular family TV show.  On his show, he's cute and funny.  In real life, he's an obnoxious almost-teenager who's demanding and spoiled.  To make his latest movie, he's shipped off to Canada with his bored, uncaring, and equally demanding mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  They're put in the care of Rick Schiller (Don McKellar), a former college professor who quit his job to make movies-and who's now working as a limo driver.  As filming begins, though, Rick becomes more than just Taylor's driver.  He soon also takes on the roles of Taylor's tutor and legal guardian-and his mother's lover.Childstar is a darkly comedic look at the world on the other side of the big screen-giving viewers a peek at the movie-making world and revealing child actors for what they really are.  It also shows another side-the broken families, the money-hungry parents, the difficulty of finding real friends, and the impossibility of having a normal childhood or living a normal life.  It even shows the child actor's future-though Taylor's costar, Chip (Brendan Fehr), a former child star who battles a fading career and a problem with addiction while trying to gain recognition as an adult.The theme may not be totally original, but it's well-executed-for the majority of the film.  Writer/director Don McKellar creates a captivating story that's insightful as well as amusing.  Unfortunately, however, things fall apart toward the end of the film, when Taylor sneaks out and follows Rick's advice to ""live a little.""  He meets a girl, decides he's fallen in love, and disappears from the set-and things go downhill from there.  The rather confusing turn of events leads to an ending that's unnecessarily preachy.As a whole, Childstar is an excellent indie.  McKellar plays his role with an understated dry wit that enhances the story.  And Rendall is wonderful in his role as the obnoxious yet conflicted child star.  Despite its disappointing conclusion, Childstar is a clever and witty film-a must-see for movie-lovers and cynics (and especially for cynical movie-lovers).",Childstar

The acting is good, the atmosphere of the movie truely inspired by the original ""The Excorsist"" -and this is actually not always so ""in common"" to all the various sequels out there as a result of the moneymachine the entertainment-industry indeed is.The positive as mentioned is the filming, acting, the locations -giving this movie the right and recognizable ""feel"" as contained the 1'st movie. The negative -well, the special effects aren't very special at all. Today you actually expect the movies to at least be stunning visually. Not here. It looks like something made in the 80's, and now I am serious! Luckily there are not many scenes that ""required"" the special treatment of computer, it's mostly psychological. The ironic thing however is that effects in this 2004-production can't be compared to the movie that was made in the early 70's! It takes away two stars, that and the horrible introduction of ""the Demon"". Were the filmakers in a hurry at the end?A shame because of the otherwise ""worthiness"" of this fourth ""Excorsist"". It is rather creepy, it made me jump several times. But the ""presence"" of the uncovered physical evil at the end as mentioned ruins some of the famous ""feel"" that a worthy sequel requires. It's not the worst I've seen, but disappointing!You expect more strenght from the Devil, and better effects from todays' moviemakers. Other than that -highly entertaining!",N/A

But the emotion is what does it for me.A not so typical family responding to a terribe situation in a less than typical way.

891605,"David S. Goyer's ""Blade: Trinity"" is the weakest of the Daywalker's adventures.  Still for fans of the series, there are just enough quality moments in the third entry to make it worthy of a viewing.A group of vampires headed by Danica Talos (Parker Posey) engineer a ploy to have the FBI capture Blade (Wesley Snipes).  After he is taken into custody, Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) liberate him.  Blade discovers that two of them belong to The Nightstalkers, a group of vampire hunters secretly trained by Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson).  Teaming up with his new allies, Blade must combat a new threat - the recently -resurrected Drake (Dominic Purcell).""Blade: Trinity"" is burdened by one major flaw - there is not enough Blade in it.  The inclusion of The Nightstalkers is a blatant attempt to set them up for a spin-off and they take away precious screen time that should have been devoted to the main character.  Making matters worse is the fact that the new vampire hunters are rather forgettable.  Reynolds' one-liners quickly become groan-inducing and Biel does not have much screen presence to speak of.  Posey fares much better in her role.  It is clear that she is having a great deal of fun and she actually manages to come across as more memorable than Purcell's Drake.  Yet, despite its problems, ""Blade: Trinity"" manages to hold together thanks to Snipes.  He once again projects that no-nonsense, loner quality that has made Blade so appealing.  Although the film does not give Snipes much to do, we still find ourselves cheering for him.  ""Blade: Trinity"" escapes the pit of mediocrity thanks to him.",N/A

343,"THE STORY: Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. ""Where did Santa's suit come from?"", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion ""Animagic"" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.This special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as ""One Foot in Front of the Other"". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.There are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend.",Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town VHS
448028,"I'm not quite sure what it is about a corporation that makes liberals lose all their rationality and common sense.  Michael Moore, in this movie, attacks the profit motive and seems to indicate that corporations ought to settle for lower profits, in exchange for raising their employee's sallaries.  Michael Moore fails to realize that unprofitable companies, or corporations with low profit margins, are even less able to pay their employee's the wages they seek.I found this film problematic for a number of reasons.  First, one does not have to live in an area where there is one employer in the entire town.  If one chooses to live in such an area, and this area is economically depressed, they should do what any reasonable person would do: move.  Second, it is unreasonable to expect that the limited skills one has...will suffice for the entire duration of their life.  Sometimes one has to learn new skills if they want to maintain employable.  To think that the nation has to stand still simply because some people do not have the proper skills is unreasonable.  Ever hear of a city college?  Try one.  You can get new skills.  One does not need to lobby Congress or be a complainer.  Instead, I'd recommend 1) going to a location that is hiring and 2) getting some new skills.  You can't lose if you do both.",N/A

931631,"""High Tension"" is very-very scary. I love horror movies and have been watching them for many years, I thought nothing can scare me now. But I was wrong. ""High Tension"" is very gruesome, very gory, very merciless and very atrocious. There are few films you really believe. Because often characters act stupid and not life-like, often when violence happens on screen we don't percept it like real violence. But here it's a completely different story. Here you really begin to understand why people tend to petrify and not to do anything when they face a murderer. In ""High Tension"" blood is blood, violence is violence - everything is for real. Sometimes it looks like this movie took all the best from ""Wrong Turn"", ""Jeepers Creepers"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", digested it and gave us in all new kind of form - more terrifying form.Watching ""High Tension"" you can't escape the thought that all is happening in safe and trouble-free France, not in some big criminal megapolis. And this thought deteriorates all your scares. Because you really start feeling yourself in characters' shoes. It can happen to anyone.To my opinion ""High Tension"" is one of the best horror movies of the last years.By the way Alexandre Aja is now making a new version of ""The Hills Have Eyes"". I'm sure the remake is in good hands.",N/A
267729,"I Really resent the fact that Turner Classic stopped showing the Charlie Chan films due to protests by Asian Americans. Were the films racist and stereotyping Orientals? Yeah...Sure they were. But how many movies of the 30's and 40's were not stereotypical in some way? Whether it was of any race or creed. Hiding them away doesn't mean they never happened. And although the actors who portrayed Charlie Chan may not have been Asian, they always portrayed him in a favorable light as being much smarter than the crooks he helped to capture. And of course many co-starred Keye Luke as #1 son who was an Asian-American.In Charlie Chan In Paris, Chan goes to France in the guise of taking a vacation with #1 son, but is really there working for a London bank, investigating a series of fraudulent bonds being passed at French banks.  Soon this leads to murder as a bank executive is killed and the daughter of the Bank's President is framed for the murder.  Chan must now solve the murder and discover the origin of the forged bonds.  Very well done mystery that kees you guessing and holds up well over the years.This was the first film that Keye Luke played Lee Chan, the #1 son so that makes this one pretty special as he always brought wonderful comic relief to the Charlie Chan Films.  This was the only Chan film directed by Lewis Seiler who would go on to make a number of excellent WWII films including ""Guadalcanal Diary"".It's quite unfortunate that these earlier films with Warner Oland as Chan are not on DVD while many of the generally awful Toller films are. Hopefully someone wakes up and realizes that there are a lot of fans clamoring for these on DVD.",N/A
473933,"This mostly forgotten thriller starring Reese Witherspoon (Lissa) and Alessandro Nivola (Nick) suffers from a mightily contrived plot and a ""Huh?--What happened?"" ending.  Nick is a guy who works at the local recycling plant (that's a new workplace for celluloid protagonists) who is about to inherit some big bucks from his father who has just kicked the bucket.Meanwhile some of his coworkers are scheming up a plot to...well, no spoilers here.  Let's just say that the viewer does not find out about this plot until the end, and then it seems a little...well, lame.Along comes Lissa looking mighty fine and they fall in love, although I must say the chemistry certainly didn't spark up the screen.  Now comes complication number one: the old man blew almost all his money and what he didn't blow the IRS is grabbing.  Because of this Nick gets tempted into driving a get-away car for a drug rip off...  Things go awry and Nick ends up in deep doo-doo, and in desperation gets Lissa to help him rip off an old school chum...which...  Well, what these people do in desperation is a little on the unbelievable side.I'm sorry that's all vague, but at least it's enough information to let you know if you actually saw this movie or not.  Now, if you like probability-challenged, convoluted plots with loose ends and a lot of unlikely twists and turns, you might find this movie interesting.  And if you like Reese, and you should, you might also find a reason for sticking around until the end.  I know I did.  She does a good job and looks good doing it.Bottom line: although the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, it can also be said that the most meticulously contrived plots sometimes turn out about as convincing as pseudoscience.  Incidentally the title is a paraphrase of the 18th century Scottish poet Robert Burns's line: ""The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men/Gang aft a-gley.""",Best Laid Plans
460588,"Life has its unique peculiarities, as individuals seek privacy and personal satisfaction when societal situations usher them into intimate seclusion.  Jan Svankmajer illustrates these peculiarities through six different city residents that in their own privacy fulfill personal void through their most intimate and personal desires.  Expressed in the most bizarre, surreal, and peculiar manner, the audience secretively gets to experience these desires, as the six characters close the doors while entering a very personal place where only they are aware of what they are doing.Much of the film plays with social symbolism and human interaction reflected through the character's intimate and personal moments, which are highlighted through clever editing and figurative camerawork.  Nothing is said, only images present the mannerisms of the characters, as the interaction between the characters such as looks and assumptions drive them further into their own sexual obsessions.  These obsessions are all surreal and bizarre.  Some examples are a man building some form of robot that can connect with an attractive news anchor, a man constructing a bird-like head for some personal erotic revenge, and a woman who brings home live fish as a substitute to her absent husband.The opening credits accompany a number of erotic prints that remove the allusions and directly display what is to come in the film, as the film depicts the unusual fetishes.  These fetishes display bizarrely amusing moments that seem inflated into absurd proportion, yet the human behaviors appear authentic in the moment.  Underneath the surrealism, the audience can reach a repressed and personal side of the characters, as they act out their fantasies in the most outlandish manners.Jan Svankmajer is known for his often bizarre imagery while using puppetry, stop-motion animation, and other creative visualizations.  Conspirators of Pleasure follows the same trend with the use of strange and outlandish creations through the intimate personal life of six city tenants.  Stop-motion, editing, puppetry, and efficient camerawork brings the audience a truly harrowing surreal study of human interaction found in the subconscious, as elements resembling voodoo, fetishes, and chickens concoct an unpleasant atmosphere.  Svankmajer's cinematic mixture eventually blends into an intelligent philosophical and psychological study of people and their peculiarities.",Conspirators of Pleasure VHS

Whitney has a crazy neighbor Dee (Drea de Matteo) who helps her figure how to meet men.  Jimmy has a friend who realizes his sexual preference isn't female and he goes through some major changes, while his other friend has a relationship with a girl in High School which is funny and sad at the same time.

329386,"Strikingly-filmed musical western delight with Rosemary Clooney, RED GARTERS makes it's DVD debut from Paramount with a fine transfer which does full justice to the film's bold Technicolor palette.  Clooney plays Calaveras Kate (perhaps a sly dig at Calamity Jane), a saloon singer who's in love with the local golden boy Jason Carberry (Jack Carson).  Though when she claps eyes on handsome cowboy Reb Randall (Guy Mitchell) she sees the perfect way of getting Jason jealous...and down the aisle!  Some great Jay Livingston-Ray Evans tunes  including ""This Is Greater Than I Thought"", ""Red Garters"" and ""Meet a Happy Guy"".  Designed in avant-garde style by Hal Pereira and Roland Anderson, the striking visual look of the film is highlighted by a yellow sky backdrop and fanciful theatre-style set pieces.Four years earlier, Clooney had been paired with up-and-comer Mitchell on a range of CALL ME MADAM cover singles for Columbia.

601599,"I don't know what went wrong with James Cameron when he produced this.  But it turned out to be a great dissppointment.The premise is actually interesting if not terribly original.  The US is now a third world country, a bomb set off above ground sent off an emp wave that erased most electronically stored information.  The government got desperate and started pushing expermintal techniques.  One of which was a super soldier program that used gene therapy to create a perfect solider.  But many of them escaped and due to their enhanced abilities manage to stay hidden.  The story is of one named Alex, who ended up in Seattle and is still looking for the othe escaped super soldiers.The good.  The plot isn't terribly original but it works.  The filming had a grittier quality to it than normal.  Some of the characters are interesting, i.e. the rich boy that runs a pirate news byte exposing corruption.The bad.  A lot unfortunately.  The writing is terrible.  Most of the side characters are annoying.  Original Cindy usually made me cringe, either the fact that she is a desperate attempt to be pc(self sufficient, black, lesbian), or her dialogue where she mainly refers to herself in third person.  Or the rest of the bike messangers who are dopey cliches that never rise beyond two dimensions.  The grunge look is overdone and the overusage of street lingo was unnerving.I was suprised that this show lasted to even a second season.  I am guessing it was James Camerons name that drove it.Though the premise is intersting, it lacks depth or quality in the writing or acting.

782733,"Is to go to a mall and pick up a DVD.  I purchased this DVD today at a mall close to where I live, and I was blown away by it. Now that I have seen this, I have more respect for the guys in Motley Crue.  Here are my thoughts,comments, and opinions for every video on here:""Kickstart My Heart""- Now this video is cool.  You get to see clips of Motley Crue performing at a concert, going sky diving, and clips of race cars crashing- a nice touch for this video and this DVD.""Same Ol' Situation""- I don't like this video as much as I like the ""Kickstart My Heart"" video, but this video is pretty good.""Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)""- I have always liked songs like this.  This is one of those songs that starts out as a really pretty ballad, and then it gets to the ""I Don't Care About You Anymore"" part of the song. The video is fun to watch, it flows along with the song.""Without You""- A great love song and a great video for a ballad.  Enough said.""Wild Side""- The video and this song are both very cool and tough, and since this video is live, you get to see Tommy Lee do something VERY cool with his drum set during this video- wait till you see what that is.""Girls, Girls, Girls""- We've all heard this song and seen this video- you get to see Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, Mick Mars, and Nikki Sixx riding their bicycles on the streets of L.A. and of course what else you would expect- there are a lot of cute girls in this video.  Little Unknown Fact: During the one part of the video where Tommy Lee whisles for those girls and they turn around but do not exactly acknowledge him, the girl in the pink dress is a twenty year old Pamela Anderson, and that is how Tommy and Pamela met each other.""Dr. Feelgood""- This video starts off in an Egyptian Desert (you just hear the bass work at that part) and then during half of the video you will see the band perform, and the other half is like a movie based off of the song. At one part of this video you actually get to see/hear Mick Mars(I'm sorry for my previous error, I just caught it) talk.""Looks That Kill""- One of Motley Crue's first music videos, and a really cool one also. One thing that is so cool about it is that the girl in the video and the guys in Motley Crue all have the same kind of makeup on.""Live Wire""- There isn't as much to this video as there is on some of the other videos on here, but both the video and the song are fun to jam along to.""You're All I Need""- I'm usually not the biggest fan of shooting a music video for a ballad and then making the video into kind of an action/drama film, but I have made an exception for this video. This video is very good,and it is a little bit similiar to Velvet Revolver's music video for ""Fall To Pieces"".""Too Young To Fall In Love""- This video is a little bit lame, but it also happens to be funny and cool.  Not one of my favorite Crue videos, but I'm still glad that it ended up on here.""Primal Scream""- One of my favorite videos on here.  Again, the video works well for the song, you see a boy in the approximate age range of 17-21 walking away and looking like he is ready for independence.  There are also a few wild animals in this video, and the guys in Motley Crue come on in this video as very cool and tough- especially Vince and Tommy.""Anarchy In The U.K.""- What Motley Crue did with this video is the exact same thing that Slaughter did with their video for ""Out For Love""- it plays the studio version of the song and shows the guys in Motley Crue onstage, backstage, and sometimes neither onstage or backstage.  This song was originally a Sex Pistols tune, and Motley Crue did a good job covering it.""Afraid""- This video is a little but hyper, and it's not bad, but it's not outstanding either. Average, on a scale of 1 to 10 I rank it as a 5.99.""Smoke The Sky""- The first video on here with John Corabi, who joined Motley Crue after Vince Neil got fired from the band. With this video, Motely Crue managed to bring the lyrics of the song to life: I won't give away too much about it, but it shows the guys in Motley Crue performing in pitch black.  Very well done.""Misunderstood""- This song is about an old man, an old woman, and a family (a father, a mother, and a son) going through hard times in their lives. I didn't like this track as much as I liked some of the other songs on Motley Crue's self-titled album with John Corabi, but this is a good song/video, and the end of it is a bit touching.  And we thought that the guys in Motley Crue didn't have hearts.""Enslaved""- Not one of the best videos on the whole DVD, but this video is enjoyable to watch.""Smokin' In The Boys Room""- A bit of a rip off of Van Halen's ""Hot For Teacher"" video, but this video is hilarious and it is even better than the song itself.""Hooligan's Holiday""- One of the best Motley Crue songs with John Corabi, one of the best songs out of all of Motley Crue's songs, and one of the best videos on the whole DVD.""Hell On High Heels""- I couldn't wait until I would finally get to comment on this video, and now I finally can: This video (in my opinion) is the best video on the whole DVD, and it is the best video out of all of Motley Crue's videos.  It is cartoon animated, you get to see cartoon figures of the guys in Motley Crue, and I shouldn't give away too much of this video, but since this song/video/and the album that this song first appeared on (""New Tattoo"") all first saw the light of day in 2000, it had good timing: One part of this video goes along with one verse in this song, and they used that one part as a whole joke about the whole Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandle and used it to make fun of Al Gore (the uncensored version, which is also to be found on this DVD, pokes fun at George W. Bush).  I wonder what Gore, Bush, Bill Clinton, and John Kerry would think of this video.""Home Sweet Home""- I prefer the '91 remix for this song/video over the original video for this song (both are to be found here, I am commenting on the original one)but if you liked the song ""Home Sweet Home"", then you will probably love this video. It was Tommy Lee who played piano on this song, and he did a great job at it.On this DVD there are also six bonus videos, a new intrview with Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee, a personal playlist, the discography of Motley Crue, and weblinks for the Crue as well. I like DVDS with music videos, and since I am such a huge Crue fan and this DVD has over twenty of their music videos, along with bonus features (which you usually don't find on a DVD with music videos) this DVD is definitely, by all means, a winner.  Thank you for reading my review of this and don't forget to get a copy of this DVD.",N/A
859510,"Ok, so I am rating this *slightly* higher than maybe it deserves (and I am in good company here). Maybe compared to all films it would rate 3.5 stars. I have a rule that certain films are judged not in comparison to all other films, but to others within the currently sparsely populated genre of gay drama.The central problem facing a reviewer of gay, non-porn movies, as I see it, is there are not enough of them to make valid comparisons. There are maybe ten thousand hetero titles in existence, and maybe a hundred gay. Therefore a gay movie does not really have to be all that good to deserve watching. A radical affirmative-action concept maybe, but only a temporary one, which I will abandon when there is enough proliferation. The thing is, we don't want to poop on the up and coming gay writers and producers, if they show promise. Okay?Four stars in this instance means this was an unpredictable, original, thought-provoking film that will please, though other reviewers are correct in saying it doesn't show much nudity. (Hey! that's not supposed to matter!) I like that none of the characters are stereotypes and all seem to be rather well-developed with their own distinct personalities. This was just as good as, I almost want to say better than, any of the *American* ""Queer as Folk"" episodes, just not as cheap, shocking and sexy as that Showtime product. ""200 American"" is more along the lines of thoughtful, mature and intelligent.I don't think the limitations of the plot (hustling...yuck, not my cup of tea) could take this film to the five star level, even within the gay genre, but that's just my hunch.",N/A
913608,"When you think of Ashton Kutcher, you're apt to think of a movie like... ""Dude Where's My Car?"", which in my opinion was not the best of films.  It's hard to believe, but a romantic comedy such as this was actually quite enjoyable.  It starts off kind of slow, but it becomes absorbing as the movie continues on.  Warning to all the guys out there though, this is pretty much a chick flick.  I'm a guy, but I happen to enjoy the soft subtle love story every now and then.The movie begins seven years ago when a man named Oliver (Kutcher) sees a girl named Emily (Amanda Peet) break up with her boyfriend just before a flight to New York.  They're both on a flight to New York.  When Oliver has to go into the bathroom to clean up, he's followed by Emily.  This is the first of several encounters they'll have over the years.As the two explore New York, they have a chance to get to know one another.  A few things in the beginning start off a little too slow, Oliver tries to go after Emily and she contantly shuns him away.  Three strikes within the first twenty minutes of the film, and Oliver already strikes out.Oliver also starts off as the sort of guy no girl in their right mind would want.  He still lives with his parents, he has no car, and he's unemployed.  The only thing he has is his charm.  The two finally decide on a bet that in six years he won't live with his parents and he'll be successful.  They drink to it, and Oliver gives up his parents phone number, claiming that when she calls, she won't find him.  Throughout the film, those six years will pass.The film first jumps about three years into the future in which Emily's boyfriend has just walked out on her on New Years.  There's a party and she has no one to go with now.  Flipping through her phonebook, she comes across Oliver's number and decides to give him a call.  This is just the first of several times over the years they'll meet up.  Most of the time, however, it's by chance.Surprisingly, the movie didn't disappoint me.  There were some cliches, such as when Oliver gives Emily a serenade in front of all her neighbors, and when Oliver and Emily finally decide they love each other, but then realize that ""someone"" is getting in the way.I was also surprised that Ashton Kutcher did a fine acting job.  I'm not a Kutcher fan, and I'm used to seeing him in stupid comedies.  However, this film was sweet, and he did a good job.Probably what I didn't like about this movie is that it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, but there aren't a whole lot of funny parts.  It has its moments, but they're too few and far between.  There's also the fact that the movie is just feels long.  Some of the more tender moments are great, but the softer parts seem to be ""fillers"" to get the movie going more.It was surprisingly good.  If you want a decent love story, this is a good film.  Not for comedy fans, and not for your stereotypical man.  It IS a ""chickflick"" so guys, the warning here is, you may not like it.",A Lot Like Love

528095,"Pathos and Hate; they are about as far apart as two emotions can be, and yet so often the two come hand in hand. Above all it is this aspect of first time director Tarsem's The Cell, and not the stunning visuals, which makes the film's most effective impact. The Cell is not just another case of style over substance as so many have said it to be, but rather an emotional tale of anger, fear and ultimately forgiveness that is told through the use of striking images instead of just dialogue.The film's central character is Catherine Deane, a child psychologist portrayed by Jennifer Lopez, who has spent a number of months using a brand new experimental technology in an attempt to help a young boy come out of his catatonic state. The boy is the son of the millionaire helping fund the project, and the technology is a device that allows one to enter the mind of another. The film's opening scene takes place in one of these situations as we see Catherine in a desert wasteland trying to make a connection with the child in question, but like her prior attempts it too ultimately ends in failure. Upon this latest failure the boy's father decides to end his son's involvement in the experiment, only to give Catherine a few more months after being convinced otherwise by the designers of the project, Dr. Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and Henry West (Dylan Baker). During the film's introduction of Catherine we also get a quick glimpse of her life, or rather her lack of one, as she has engulfed herself with the project to such an extent that she has time for little else.At the same time we are introduced to Carl Stargher, a demented and very complex serial killer, played by Vincent D'Onofrio in an absolutely astonishing performance that is so good that I would be tempted to recommend the film on it alone. Carl is about as strange as they get (at least in an R-rated film) as he finds relief by torturing young women in ""The Cell"" an escape-proof room that slowly fills with water until his victim drowns. And as we are shown in one of the film's more disturbing scenes, Carl watches his victims as they drown while hanging midair on a number of hooks that have been inserted into his back. Once Carl has gone through that part of the process, he continues his ritual by turning his victim into a doll-like creation through the use of bleach. Again, as sick as it is, Carl somehow finds comfort in it all.Carl is also extremely sloppy; he dumps the bodies where it is easy to find them and leaves a number of clues behind wherever he goes. The FBI, which believes that Carl wants to be caught, is right on his tale, and almost ready to make an arrest. Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is in charge of the manhunt, which quickly locates Carl. The only trouble is that Carl, who still has one more victim in the process of being tortured, is found lying in a coma after suffering one too many seizures. In order to find the last of Carl's victims before her fate is sealed it is suggested that Catherine should go into the Carl's mind. Despite having her doubts Catharine agrees to do so. Upon doing so The Cell starts to work on a whole new level.Catherine's first encounter is with Carl's younger-self, who is the exact opposite of the Carl's current state, but at the same time troubled in his own way. Catherine attempts to make the connection, but can't as young Carl disappears without a trace. Soon afterwards the first interaction occurs between Catherine and Carl's other personality, an evil demon-like creature who rules supreme in the world that has been constructed within Carl's head, in one of the film's most visually striking scenes. During her second ""session"" Catherine encounters young Carl once again, with young Carl opening up to her (and us) for the first time. We see what turned Carl into what he was and his ""reasoning"" for his actions. This second encounter is one of the film's best overall scenes as it leaves us with a number of feelings towards Carl. We hate him, we fear him, and yet we start to feel sorry for him (or at least for his inner-child) despite what he has done. Yet, Tarsem doesn't overdo the sympathy that he creates for Carl, as we are soon reminded once again of what Carl really is and in doing so an excellent balance is formed throughout, and in this scene especially, between the three aspects of Carl's persona.The rest of the film is filled with interesting, and often disturbing images throughout that I will leave for you to discover. However, the vast majority of the imagery in these scenes, as it was with the earlier scenes, is used to tell the story. There are very few images that serve no other purpose than to be looked at, another aspect that makes The Cell such an amazing film. Furthermore, in doing so the film leaves much to the imagination of the viewer as definite answers are not given but instead suggested by the film's imagery. In this sense the film generated some of the same reactions that are generated in my mind while watching 2001: A Space Odyssey. At first glance the films have almost nothing in common (other than their trip-out scenes), but upon getting into the film, The Cell, like 2001, also says something (although it be very different) about the human race through the use images instead of just words.Much has been made about the underdevelopment of both Catherine and Peter. While it is a problem, it isn't that big of one, especially in the case of Catherine since we get to know a lot about her from the interactions she has with all three parts of Carl. Vaughn's character was by far the weakest of the three leads as he was primarily used to move the story along. With that small exception The Cell works in every other aspect. In addition to what has already been mentioned, The Cell also works as a film that terrifies. While it isn't filled with jump scenes or many other moments that are terribly scary in themselves, it is able to create a frightening experience nonetheless (think The Exorcist rather than a standard slasher flick) by the sense of eeriness that accompanies the film as a whole. I could literary talk about The Cell for hours, but instead of saying anymore I'll leave the rest up to you, as it truly is a film that should be experienced first hand and a film that I will personally never forget.****, (10/10)",N/A
891075,"I went in to this movie with really low expectations.  I had not been to happy with the last few Hellraiser films, mainly because they didn't feel like Hellraiser movies at all.  Well, this one still feels distant from the core Hellraiser material, but it's nowhere near as far out as parts five and six.Actually, once Pinhead and the other cenobites show up, it makes sense.  He isn't in the movie much, and focus is more on the lead actress just trying to understand what she had gotten herself in to.  It works for the most part.I was surprised at how gritty this movie was as well.  The violence is intense, and there is a good deal of nudity (mostly female, but a bit of male).  The sexual edge that was present in the original Hellraiser is back.Die hard Hellraiser fans will probably hate this movie.  It is way more pulpy in feel.  It is grittier than Inferno and Hellseeker, but it still lacks the down to earth feel of the first movie, or the fairy tale horror of the second.  Still, it works, and delivers in the disturbing imagery, hardcore gore, dark sexuality, and all while keeping some decent acting and a fairly strong script.  Not bad at all.",Hellraiser: Deader

Everyone by now knows the results, so I don't need to worry about spoiling anything.After a 3 hour pyrotechnic sequence, and an emotional rendition of 'Billy-Jean' sung by the ghost of Roy Orbison, the event finally opened with a segment by Orlando Jordan, telling his loyal fans that if - no, WHEN he wins the rumble, he will make it his personal business to wipe out fourth-world debt. He was attacked by Howard Finkel with a plastic hairbrush, and was left bleeding.Jesse James, Rikishi Fatu, Rey Mysterio, Jerry Lawler, Mick Foley (all three personas) and Terry Funk defeated the Legion Of Doom in a 'Loser Must Die' elimination tag team match, when Rey Mysterio pinned Road Warrior Hawk for the decisive fall. As a result, Animal and Hawk were subsequently gunned down and killed by their own children.Shane McMahon defeated Stephanie McMahon in a street fight, with Vince McMahon as the special guest referee, after a diving 'hell-bow' drop from a 150 storey building in a different city.Afterwards, the two shook hands and hugged. However, Vince was so upset by Stephanie's performance, he ordered her to strip down to her underwear to everyone could point and laugh at her. Stephanie obliged, but no sooner had she done so, she revealed a secret pocket in her knickers, inside of which was a steel chair, which she used to render her father unconscious. He has been in a coma ever since.Triple H won a match he wasn't even fighting to win the World Heavyweight Title for the 7th time in 3 days. This was his 48th World title reign in total. After the match, the man he defeated for the title, Cowboy Bob Orton, said he was down-hearted by the loss, but informed his fans he would keep going, hopefully eventually marrying a member of the McMahon family so he can have the same, unjustified success that Triple H has been having. (UPDATE: With hindsight on my side, I must apologise for calling Triple H's success 'unjustified'. I feel that's somewhat too simple, as he is clearly talented and someone WWE cannot do without in their main-event scene. However, I still feel he's over-egged it somewhat in the past and his on-paper legacy is probably going to be a bit too decorated.)Shawn Michaels and Diesel defeated the referee in a 'Squeeze My Spot' match for the ABC Amateur Boxing Heavyweight Title, after a double-team Eye Rake. As a result, the referee (aptly played by Tim Robbins of 'Shawshank Redemption' fame) needed 750,000 stitches in his brain.Undertaker defeated Yokozuna in an Inferno Match. Although Yokozuna was never set on fire, Kane suddenly arrived 7 years and 9 months earlier than he was supposed to, to recite poetry in honour of Jimi Hendrix. Yokozuna fainted in a pool of tears, and the Undertaker forged his signature onto a contract that said the Undertaker could win via 'standing up'. The contract also read that Yokozuna had to dress up like a dolphin for all future matches, which was the spawning of a comedic lineage that will never be out-done.In the 300 man Royal Rumble match, which lasted over 15 hours, the first two entrants, Orlando Jordan and Howard Finkel, were the last two in the ring.

897500,"Nominated for 6 Golden Globes and 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, The Aviator wows audiences with its breadth of scenery and vivid realism. Director Martin Scorsese, known for a host of excellent films such as Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), and Gangs Of New York (2002) - not to mention the highly controversial The Last Temptation Of Christ (1988) - by no doubt turns out his best work since Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) sought to become a made man. The Aviator springs to life with nostalgic settings and a lavish tapestry of color and form, evoking all the enthusiasm indicative of Howard Hughes' unique lust for life. John Logan, known for such films as The Last Samurai (2003) and Gladiator (2000), presents a screenplay that provides some insight into the enigmatic Hughes and captures the mannerisms of those who shared that life with him. In short, the film is a masterpiece of visual imagery and first-rate cinematography few movie lovers can afford to miss...The Aviator focuses on the early life (1930-1947) of America's most eccentric and bewildering billionaire playboy, Howard Hughes. Know for his seemingly erratic business dealings and fearless sense of adventure, Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) turned a small inherited fortune into an enormous corporate empire. And along the way, he captured the imagination of those around him with an attitude that embraced risk and life itself. Inheriting a majority interest in the Hughes Tool Company (founded by his father), Hughes embarks on a career in Hollywood where he produces a number of notable films including Hell's Angels, The Front Page, and Scarface. Hughes' obsessive dedication to perfection makes his stock rise in Hollywood and even helps launch the career of Jean Harlow...But Howard Hughes is not just a one-trick pony, and his interest soon turns to the flourishing aviation industry where he becomes an integral part of TWA and pilots his own planes on a regular basis. His driving energy would lead Hughes to enter the defense industry, the electronics industry, Las Vegas casinos, and numerous other activities in the years ahead. But along the way, he deals with a cast of characters colorful in their own right. Romances with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) provide insight into Hughes' personal life, while Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly), Hughes' assistant and right-hand man, sacrifices much in his own life to enable Hughes to live out his latest visions and inspirations. When Hughes makes the bold move of constructing the Spruce Goose - the largest airplane ever built (and able to land on water no less) - Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) accuses the billionaire of war-profiteering. Hughes takes on the Senator full-force and with all the zest that marked his previous ventures. Vowing that the Spruce Goose will fly, in the face of highly publicized claims that it will not, Hughes proves his critics wrong, and the Spruce Goose rises to the occasion...Despite its loss to Million Dollar Baby at the Oscars, The Aviator can take pride in being nominated as one of the best films of the year (along with Finding Neverland, Ray, and Sideways). And the film is certainly deserving of that high honor. Few films better illustrate the beauty of America, or more importantly, the mountains that can be moved when a single individual lives his life with ambition, drive, inspiration, and a naked enthusiasm for all that life has to offer. Overall, The Aviator is among the best films of the past several years, and movie aficionados would be well-advised to watch every last minute with same enthusiasm of a young Howard Hughes...The DVD Report",N/A

507186,"it is the business of the artist to follow it home to the heart of the individual fighters-not to talk in armies and nations and numbers-but to track it home.  D.H. LawrenceThe Russo-Finnish War, known as ""The Winter War"", began on November 30, 1939 when the Red Army invaded Finland.  The war began after the Finns refused demands from Stalin to move its borders 25 kilometers back from Leningrad.  The basis for this demand was the fear on the part of Stalin and the Soviet High Command that Hitler could launch an invasion of the USSR directed at Leningrad using Finland as a base for its attack.  The Winter War ended by means of a truce signed on March 12, 1940.  During this brief three-month war a Finnish army consisting of 180,000 men, most of them reservists waged a defensive battle against an advancing Soviet army of about 450,000 men.  Fighting from entrenched positions against full-frontal assaults resulted in the death of close to 23,000 Finnish soldiers.  At the same time more than 126,000 Soviet soldiers were killed or missing and another 264,000 were wounded.  This short war had a dramatic impact on the future course of the Second World War (the Winter War took place during the `phony war' period between the occupation of Poland and the commencement of Germany's invasion of France).  The horrifying losses suffered by the Red Army were a reflection of the chaos caused by purges of the military that practically eliminated every professional officer from the Red Army.  This vulnerability could only have encouraged Hitler in making his decision to invade the USSR in June 1941. Finnish film director Pekka Parikka's 1989 film ""The Winter War"" is an exceptionally well made movie about this little-known (at least to me) war. The film is not about armies fighting armies as much as it is about the individual fighters who, collectively, are called upon to wage war against an invading army.Parikka's film follows the war through the eyes of a small platoon of reservists called up from their village to fight the war.  It begins with their mobilization and their trip to the front lines through three months of brutal and bloody fighting.  The film appears to be very accurate from a historic perspective.  The reservists are shown being issued incomplete, if any, uniforms, and finding gear and supplies when and if they can.  The Finns, lacking in anti-tank weaponry invented the Molotov Cocktail to use against Soviet mechanized divisions and the film shows these ad hoc weapons being used to great effect.  Particularly well done are the scenes that show the impact of the war on the rather stoic inhabitants of the platoon's village.The Winter War is a straight-forward narrative of the war and how it was fought. It has a particular emphasis on the ugly reality of war.  It is not for the squeamish.  The film is not an examination of the souls or characters of the people that fought the war. This is true even of the principal actors.  The characters in the film are involved in fighting a war, they are not there to engage in discussions of the meaning of life.  However, I thought the film was very well done and certainly worth watching.  Those with an interest in war films generally or interested in well made films that cover corners of our history that is not overly familiar to them should find this a rewarding film to watch.  I've seen plenty of movies about the D-Day landings, the Battle of the Bulge, and the like.  This is the first film I've seen on the Russo-Finnish war.A word about the price.  This DVD contains no extra features and is not in letterbox format.  Although it is an excellent movie I cannot advise anyone to buy it at the current list price of $45.00.  I purchased a new copy through an Amazon marketplace vendor and paid 1/3 of the list price.  At that price it is a 5-star film.  At the list price I think the viewer may feel that he has paid a bit too much. That is ultimately why I rated this film 4 stars and not 5.L. Fleisig",The Winter War VHS

After all, directed by Richard Burton, Music by Prince, how can you go wrong? Well it kept my attention and parts of it were enjoyable but mostly it just drove me `batty'. I didn't care for the tepid, lukewarm love story that was sewn into this movie. I find Bill and Hillary's romance more exciting frankly.Next there was Michael Keaton. I don't think he kept his identity as Batman a secret, instead I think it was just that he didn't even realize he was Batman himself. He wanders though this movie in a daze. It's like he didn't realize the camera was rolling and was just killing time until the director yelled ""action!"" In short this is no different from any other movie he's played in.How did Jack Nicholson fare in this movie? Not bad, although this was the 5th or so film where he played the psycho dad from The Shining. I hear that when he was asked how long he studied for this film his answer was, ""as little as possible.""This movie also took a lot of liberties assuming we were familiar with the whole Batman world. Therefore nothing is foreshadowed. When he needs to make a quick getaway we're introduced to the bat-grappling hook. When they're driving through the bad part of the neighborhood there's bat-mobile-bat-armor.

766145,"Whedon has always been a high-concept man, summing up the gist of his shows in one sentence is staggeringly easy.  Buffy is the valley girl as world savior.  Firefly is the Wild West in Space.  Others have done this Wild West in space thing before but never this explicitly.  I am still on the fence about the soundtrack which still clashes no matter how much I see it.  Whedon's most daring dramatic exploit as well as his trademark is to combine extreme emotional situations with sarcastic skewering comedy, shown most ingeniously with the fake death in the Pilot episode.  His filmmaking pedigree has always been surprisingly avant-garde for television.  His directing on all of his series is singular.  Here he is incorporating jump cuts, fractured scene structures, and overall a more somber mood.  The hand-held CGI was jacked by Battlestar Galactica.  (A good show in its own right, but far more serious and heavy-handed)  All said, Whedon's guidance is impressive, and just adds to the anticipation for the Firefly movie where he has hopefully the budget and power to do what he wishes to do.  I still don't get why Firefly was cancelled, this is the network that lets lowbrow base entertainment like Joe Millionaire co-exist with intelligent well-written dramas and comedies like 24 and Arrested Development.  Firefly definitely had cult show written all over it, but so did X-Files and that lasted for 9 years and made Fox untold millions.

465489,"Madonna was one of the quintessential stars of the MTV era.  Artists such as Michael Jackson and Prince made good use of the form, but Madonna's entire career was built upon smart collaborator choices and a chameleon image which makes her even more of an industry unto herself than the other two.Not all of these videos are great, or even good.  But two things are certain:  a) They served as mini-fashion shows for whatever persona Madonna was trying to project at the time, and b) the best videos on this collection are some of the best videos of all time.First let's get the bad points over with.  ""Papa Don't Preach"", while a great (and daring) pop single, is given a camembert visual treatment.  Danny Aiello was a good choice to play the ""papa"" in question, but cheesy jump-cuts (as if the director had just discovered the nouvelle vague) and a flat-out inexplicable performance segment ruin the video.  The performance footage is the laziest kind, Madonna looking into the camera and shaking around, but the slutty, cleavage-crazy costume and horrible choreography merely serve to overturn the innocent ""pregnant girl"" image she projects in the narrative segments, and Madonna's attempt at emoting merely reminds us how wretched she is as an actress.  ""Like a Prayer"" was controversial but not much else, a promising series of concepts wasted, never developed, and ""Like a Virgin"" is just a concept-less exploitation of a nice-looking location, horrendously boring especially on rewatches.But when Madonna hits her peaks in music video, she's every bit as good at it (and arguably more complex thematically) than Michael Jackson.  ""Vogue"" is an acknowledged classic, its tone and artistic presentation unique in music-video history; the dance sequences are fabulous and unlike any other, getting across a decadence which suits Madonna's persona perfectly.  ""Oh Father"" is her pinnacle, a simple yet moving story with perfect rhythm, superhumanly beautiful photography and Citizen Kane-inspired dissolves.  ""Express Yourself"" is probably her most representative video, almost arrogant in its raw physicality and over-the-top setting.  With the above videos (as well as other masterpieces such as Aerosmith's ""Janie's Got a Gun""), director David Fincher had established himself as the king of music-video, laying the path for his illustrious film career ahead.  No surprise that Fincher remains the only music-video director who graduated with complete success to features; his videos are cinematic like no other.  And the themes explored in these videos -- deviant sexuality, parental neglect, sorrow, idolatry, solitude -- are unusually sophisticated for the format.Aside from the above classics, there are also a couple of slices of guilty pleasure -- the buoyant fiesta of ""La Isla Bonita"", the blatant Marilyn Monroe tribute in ""Material Girl"" (still Madonna's most famous on-film image), and the cheesy yet endearing ""Cherish"".  The late Herb Ritts had only one visual style for both his photographs and his music videos, and his video work is almost always devoid of narrative, but his style works within its own limited confines, and ""Cherish"" comes across just like Janet Jackson's ""Love Will Never Do (Without You)"", more like an intimate photo album of an artist than a motion picture.Finally, we have the MTV Music Video Awards performance of ""Vogue"".  Compared with the MTV performance by Michael Jackson (included on his HIStory DVD), Madonna positively kicked Jackson's behind.  Where Jackson's ""medley"" performance was repetitive, overlong and messy, Madonna's was precise, lavish and fit the song perfectly.  A certain sense of cold manipulation does creep in (you know what reaction she's looking for when the dancers squeeze her breasts and when she lifts her skirt), but nevertheless the overall performance is a classic just for the choreography.I've never cared for Madonna's post-1994 videos -- my interest in her video work stopped with ""Bad Girl"" and ""This Used to Be My Playground"" -- but this collection is a keeper.  Even if Madonna's '80s videos weren't as consistently groundbreaking or enjoyable as Michael Jackson's, her best work scales some remarkable heights.",Madonna - The Immaculate Collection

Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show ""Quantum Leap"", that ran between 1989-1993), gets permission from Starfleet to take the experimental starship named Enterprise, with serial number NX-01, to Kronos, in spite of the misgivings from Vulcans, who don't believe that mankind is sufficiently prepared to begin exploring other worlds and encounter more alien species.  The NX-01 is the first man-made starship capable of traveling at a speed of warp 5.  Capt. Archer then assembles the rest of his crew for the new Enterprise, including the non-human Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), the Vulcan Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating), Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) and Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer).  With over 12,000,000 viewers watching the premiere episode, it initially appeared that UPN, which broadcasted the show, would have another successful ""Star Trek"" series, just as it had with ""Star Trek Voyager"".  Unfortunately, subsequently shows had much smaller audiences that only continued to shrink with each season. The average number of viewers per episode for the first season was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  It was during the fourth season that UPN decided to cancel the series, even though there were still another three seasons to be produced because the fourth season ratings dropped even further to 3.1 million viewers per episode.The question, then, is why did ""Star Trek Enterprise"" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 ""Star Trek"" fans living in the U.S.A.?  Personally, I believe several factors are responsible.  First, the only truly interesting characters were Dr. Phlox and T'Pol.  The characters of Reed and Trip were often annoying.  However, the most annoying character during the first season was Capt. Archer himself, who repeatedly acted like an arrogant uninvited guest towards every alien species and outpost encountered.  Second, the inclusion of the previously unknown species called the Suliban and the notion of a ""temporal cold war"" from the far distant future ran tangent to the notion that ""Enterprise"" was supposed to be a prequel leading up to the time of Capt. Kirk.  Third, the technology and overall look of the NX-01 often appeared more advanced than what was used in the original 1966-1969 ""Star Trek"" series, which is supposed to be 100 years more advanced than ""Enterprise"".  Fourth, insufficient attention was given to portraying the various extraterrestrial races responsible for for forming the United Federation of Planets: the Vulcans, the Andorians, the Tellarites, and the Alpha Centauris; as well as to other races known during Capt. Kirk's time.  Though the Vulcans were a frequent race depicted in the first season of ""Enterprise"", the only other future founding race of the United Federation of Planets were the Andorians, which appeared in only two first-season episodes: ""The Andorian Incident"" and ""Shadows of P'Jem"".  The blame for these various factors that directly contributed to the premature cancellation of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" rests solely with producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Unfortunately, the addition of producer Manny Coto who did an amazing job of reconnected the fourth season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" to the rest of the ""Star Trek"" TV series came too late to save the show.Of the 26 episodes the comprise the first season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"", the most memorable were ""Broken Arrow"", ""Fight or Flight"", ""Strange New World"", ""Unexpected"", ""Terra Nova"", ""The Andorian Incident"", ""Breaking the Ice"", ""Civilization"", ""Fortunate Son"", ""Silent Enemy"", ""Dear Doctor"" (one of the best first-season episodes), ""Sleeping Dogs"", ""Shadows of P'Jem"", ""Oasis"", ""Two Days and Two Nights"" and season finale ""Shockwave, Part 1"".  One disappointing episode was ""Fusion"", which appeared to contradict descriptions from other ""Star Trek"" TV series that Vulcans had always practiced mind melds; as was the episode ""Acquisition"", which included the Ferengi: a species that had only been introduced in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", 200 years later.Overall, I rate the first season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was an interesting experiment that had it been given more time, probably would have blossomed into a far better series thanks to the efforts of Manny Coto.",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season
234620,"Wandering through the CD section of Amazon can sometimes be surprisingly rewarding - especially when you come across a hidden gem like The Last of Sheila. This whodunit with its fantastic 70s cast, wonderful French Riviera sets, and tight scripting will delight traditional mystery fans.The Last of Sheila is basically a game within a game within a game. It was scripted by Game Fanatics Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins. Clues appear throughout, but you have to have a puzzle solver's mind to get them. If you do, you're bound to enjoy this special film. The solution is complex and rewarding, even if the ending is a little odd.The French Riviera background is wonderful and is a character all it own. My wife and I visited the monastery on our honeymoon, so seeing it here is a real personal treat. This is a classy production that really uses its location well.The cast is very 70s, but excellent. Canon, Colburn, and Benjamin steal the show for the most part, but Mason truly shines at the end. Ian McShane also stands out in his younger, hipper, pre-Love Joy days.Although the extras on this DVD are almost non-existent, the audio commentary by Cannon and Benjamin (and Welch to a lesser extent) stands out. It's full of remembrances and Hollywood name dropping; Benjamin especially shares some great memories of Perkins' love of games and the parties he would throw. I was delighted by their graciousness and warm anecdotes. Cannon and Benjamin obviously taped theirs together, and they play off each other throughout. I assume Welch taped hers separately, which is why it never fits with the other two, so we should cut her some slack.One minor warning, this is an older movie, developed when people didn't suffer from ADD, and younger audiences will find it a bit talky. Viewers with good attention spans who don't require explosions and constant camera cuts will love it.",N/A
325935,"I found this film more valuable as an exploration of 1930s science and social mores than as entertainment.  Cathy Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) is a traumatized girl whom everyone has a stake in shutting up--everyone, that is, except the doctor slated to perform an obviously inappropriate lobotomy upon her (Monty Clift).  Elizabeth Taylor delivers a strong if sometimes overwrought performance as Cathy.  Katherine Hepburn gives a textured performance as the eponymously named Mrs. Venable, Cathy's venerable, manipulative, and delusional aunt.  Mercedes McCambridge is appropriately annoying as Cathy's ignoramus of a mother.  Clift can't quite overcome the inherent limitations of his character, whose main purpose seems to be to serve as a foil for the others.The poetic style of Williams' original play is preserved in the lines of Mrs. Venable, which makes Hepburn's scenes especially fun: Mrs. Venable could almost be an aging Blanche Dubois.  This alone makes the film worth checking out.",Suddenly Last Summer VHS
670063,"Imagine for a moment that you're a regular bloke and you want to do something to help the New York City homeless. You've got very little money, no resources, but a big heart. What could you possibly do to make a dent in their population?If you're Marc Singer, the man behind this Sundance Award winning documentary, you found a way to do quite a lot.For a person who'd never touched a movie camera before starting in on this ""project"", one can see why this film impacts its viewers on multiple levels. Shot in grainy black-and-white 16mm film, this documentary gives us a startlingly real-life look at several homeless people living in self-built shanties in the Amtrak tunnels under the city. No light makes it down there, except whenever a train skirts by or via the makeshift lighting this weird community has produced by tapping into Amtrak's electrical system.Marc Singer delves into this society. And I mean he DELVES. Mr. Singer gave up living on the surface and slunk into this netherworld for two years in order to shoot his film. And who did he use as grips, sound assistants, and lighting experts? The homeless themselves.More interesting than the film itself is how it got made. After watching the documentary, I went ahead and looked over the special features on the DVD and found a ""Making Of"" track which focused on Mr. Singer and how he accomplished his film making. This showed the incredible lack of understanding of anything related to filming and those who helped him out, both in teaching him and by giving him financial help so that the documentary made it out to the public. We also get to see the amazing multiple awards that the documentary won at Sundance; an incredible set of scenes that contrasts starkly with what Mr. Singer had gone through in order to make this film a reality.Never giving up on his newfound tunnel companions, never letting financial devastation overtake him, never giving up creative control, all added to the success of the film and my enjoyment of all aspects of it. Bravo, Mr. Singer.(You might be asking what happens to the tunnel-bound homeless. It's a perfect ending to the film, so you'll have to watch it. I ain't giving it away!)",Dark Days

145528,"Though Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Kalidor in this movie rather than Conan, I always think of this movie as the third Conan movie.  Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman, who played Valeria in ""Conan the Barbarian"") takes an orb from a sort of temple of all women who plan to lock it away forever, coincidentally at the same time that Queen Gedren has come to steal it.  The orb has the power to destroy, and if left in the light too long it has the power to destroy the Earth.  We are introduced Red Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen) whose sister was one of the women in the temple and who has taken on the task of retrieving the orb before it can be used to destroy the Earth.  Naturally this quest is also Kalidor's, so though the two take separate paths, they all eventually end up in the same place.Along the way to Gedren's kingdom we encounter Prince Tarn (Ernie Reyes, Jr., ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II"" and ""Surf Ninjas) and his bodyguard and servant Falkon (Paul L. Smith).  Unfortunately, these two characters are the comic relief and while there are a few moments where they are at least humorous, it only takes a while for them to become tedious.The foursome travel to Queen Gedren's kingdom, all the while she continues to make the glowing orb more and more powerful.  She is also aware that Red Sonja and her party are on the way, and tries to prevent them from reaching her kingdom.  One of her attempts involves a giant wind-up toy that makes funny noises and swims in circles, often towing one or more characters from the movie.  Naturally Prince Tarn was part of the reason they encountered the beastie, and no matter how many times I tell him to go back, get out of the water, it just never seems to happen.Ultimately the crew reaches Queen Gedren, there is the obligatory big fight, and things mostly resolve themselves as you would probably expect.There are several remarkable and not-so-remarkable scenes in this movie.  In one of the better scenes the party travels across the backbone of some sort of ancient monster.  When Arnold encounters Red Sonja she is completing some sort of test to prove that she is ready to graduate from the ""Funky Japanese Guy with Stuff Coming out of His Shoulders School of Mystical Sword Work.""  The arena in which she is fighting is cool, but for some reason they put a guy squatting over the entrance that looks to me like someone attempting to perform a bodily function, and I laugh every time I watch it.  The temple of warrior women at the beginning of the movie where the orb is located is also well done, both the interiors and exteriors.  I also thought Queen Gedren had a reasonably well-done castle.This movie has good points and awful points.  The fighting is generally well-done throughout, but there are the usual stupid points.  For example, the warrior women are surrounding the glowing orb, which they plan to lock in the dark forever.  It would seem to the average warrior that a lookout would be advisable.  Second, once the locking procedure started, followed by the attack, all one of the priestess-warriors had to do was kick the key into the same deep pit the orb was going to go into, and the orb would have been closed up while the fighting was going on.  Of course, that would have ended the movie and what fun would that have been.Another problem is that Queen Gedren had this orb with all kinds of power, along with a castle filled with soldiers, and yet she allowed Red Sonja to live, with more than a hint of Gedren's sexual orientation.  Given her megalomaniacal tendencies, you would have thought that Gedren would have summarily disposed of the group.  It just seems like you can't predict the behavior of psychopaths in movies (ever notice that?).Arnold movies usually introduce humor to keep the movie from being too serious, but this time some the humor was ill-timed and often ill planned.  Ernie Reyes, Jr. plays a comedic character, and detracts too much from the plot line.  Similarly, Paul Smith as Falkon was often for comedic effect, and it was too much like watching Laurel and Hardy do Conan rather than a typical Arnold movie.This movie ends up being a movie of contrasts.  The movie begins with an excellent premise.  Portions of the movie are fun to watch.  However, the campy portions drag down the good portions, and all of the potential of the movie is squandered in silliness.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was an excellent Conan, and this movie could easily have been a third Conan movie, particularly given that the two Conan movies were much better done than this movie.  I will recommend that you watch this movie, but do so as a rental rather than a purchase; you'll be happy you did.",N/A
874672,"This is one of those films that looks great when you read the cast list, but that suffers in the execution. It is the terrific acting that carries the viewer through Panic in the Streets' non-plot (actually an Academy Award-winning screen story from the husband and wife team of Edna and Edward Anhalt).Richard Widmark stars as a military doctor who discovers that a recently murdered man had pneumonic plague and would have died in a couple of days anyway. Since it is communicable through the air, he wants to find and quarantine the killer in order to avoid an epidemic.At the same time, he is trying to keep the story from the press -- one tenacious reporter, in particular -- because people will leave town, those already infected spreading the plague over the country (and possibly throughout the world). The meat of Panic in the Streets involves Widmark searching for the killer with local police chief Paul Douglas.The killer is Blackie, played by Jack Palance (or Walter Jack Palance here) in his film debut. When Blackie gets wind of the investigation of the murdered man, he assumes that he had been hiding something and goes after the man's cousin, with flunky Fitch (Zero Mostel) in tow. (Their relationship reminds me of the Warner Brothers duo of Cockney cartoon dogs Spike and Chester (right) -- or Abbott and Costello without the humor.)(About Zero Mostel: Director Kazan would later name Mostel to the House Un-American Activities Committee led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Mostel was one of many who were blacklisted and didn't work in entertainment for most of the 1950s. He would eventually revive his career and appear in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, The Producers, and The Front, a film about the Blacklist).Sprung from a potentially fascinating story, Panic in the Streets is, unfortunately, overlong and contains little suspense about the eventual outcome. On the plus side, Widmark has a terrific talent for palying a regular guy and his antagonistic relationship with Douglas is the heart of the picture (despite Kazan's attempts to do that with Widmark's scenes at home with wife Barbara Bel Geddes).Also, Palance shows why he made a career of playing creeps (and then making fun of that persona in his Academy Award-winning performance in City Slickers): the man has an awesome presence. Mostel, on the other hand, seems to be only going through the motions, giving Fitch none of the depth that he would endow Max Bialystock with almost twenty years later in The Producers.An extra subplot or two might have fleshed out Panic in the Streets closer to perfection but, as it is, it is simply a passably tense film of a universal fear. However, I do hope that this DVD release introduces Richard Widmark to modern audiences. Popular in radio and film (he's likely best known for his darker turn in his debut, Kiss of Death), Widmark has an instantly recognizable voice and a naturalness that makes any performance of his worth watching.",N/A

583635,"Somehow, ""The Gift"" fell through the cracks when it came out in theaters.  That's hard for me to understand, because not only does it have a brilliant cast, it's a great story that holds on to you and keeps you enthralled for the entire time.  It stars Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes.  It also stars Keanu Reeves in what I consider to be his best performance as a wife-beating slackjaw who constantly hurts his wife(played with trailer trash charm by Hilary Swank).  There's also a brief but very intense cameo by Dennis Hopper.The basic plot is this:  A murder has occurred in Blanchett's sleepy little town.  No one knows who committed it and leads are slim.  In desperation, the local authorities seek out Blanchett's psychic abilities to look for clues.  What ensues is a haunting tale of good ol' fashion spooks, creepy sequences, and a wonderful little mystery that keeps a grip on you.Written by Billy Bob Thornton, who has a knack for capturing the good folks of the South, and Tom Epperson.

852276,"This movie could have been twice as good in the hands of another director. Some of the lines are both written and delivered horribly, even by normally competent actors like Brad Pitt. I'm not extremely familiar with the story of The Iliad, so I can't really comment on all the changes to the plot. I know that the role of the Greek gods was almost completely excised, however, and thus Troy is a demythologization of Homer (in the same way that The Thirteenth Warrior is a demythologization of the ""Beowulf"" story). Some people hate this, but I think it works. In a movie version of this story, I would rather see what likely happened in the battle for Troy than Homer's souped-up version that has the gods flying around on the battlefield in their chariots like superheroes. Pitt portrays the man-killer Achilles and his thirst for glory well, but Eric Bana is even better as Hector. The battle between these two heroes and the events that follow are extremely powerful and heart-wrenching. The battle scenes are reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, but sometimes the cinematography is horrible.

I wished that Davison could have stayed with the show another season or two, as it was just in his third season as Doctor Number Five (the classic series' 21st season overall) in which he finally seemed to have settled into the role and become more comfortable.  ""Caves"" was written by veteran DW writer/former script editor Robert Holmes (Terror of the Autons/The Ark in Space/The Talons of Weng-Chiang, etc.) who turns out a Doctor Who adventure which is not only the best of Peter Davison's tenure as the Doctor, but also one of the show's greatest stories ever.  The late Christopher Gable turns in a great performance as the tragic antihero Sharaz Jek.  And John Normington is also great as the true central villain Morgus.

718752,"These three classic Hammer horror movies are essential additions to horror buff DVD collections. Released in the same year as classics Touch of Evil and Vertigo, Dracula (1958) managed to not only stand out as a fantastic piece of artfully contrived entertainment but also saved the studio from some shaky antecedent years. Featuring a powerful performance from Peter Cushing as vampire hunter Van Helsing, Dracula offers plenty of nail-biting suspense and healthy amounts of gore (Surprising, considering the film's release date). And of course, there's the fantastic Christopher Lee in one of his first major movie roles, who turns in one of his best performances as the snarling, hissing count. Melissa Stribling and Michael Gough provide great support amidst the thrills. Under the steady hand of horror veteran Terence Fisher, Dracula is a fan favorite, and an indispensable chapter for the genre.Lee, Cushing and director Fisher also created the fantastic Curse of Frankenstein in the previous year. One of the best examples in its field, the action is great, James Bernard's chilling music sends a shiver down the spine, and Jack Asher's stunning cinematography is haunting. Like the Bela Lugosi Dracula, Christopher Lee was Hammer's answer to Boris Karloff, a trend he would continue in the 1959 film The Mummy. While perhaps not as resounding as the previous two movies, Lee and Cushing's added gravitas give so much to a fairly standard plot. The standout is Cushing, whose role as the nervous archeologist John Banning provides much of the film's emotion and exposition. Considering that the fully bandaged role for Lee basically means that all you see are his eyes (Except for an excellent flashback explaining how Kharis came to be mummified alive) yet he still manages to give more scares than a bucket load of CGI can muster. Yvonne Furneaux shines in dual roles as Kharis' love Princess Ananka and Banning's wife, Isobel. And that ending? Creepy to say the least. Lee's creature performances outshine Karloff (And that's not easy) and despite the notoriety of the earlier originals, these three classics have stood the test of time to become the cherished horror gems they are today.",N/A
633500,"Clint Eastwood is a master, no doubt.  I do *not* miss his films .. unless they hit on my ""no-no""s, rape or needless brutality.  This 1 does neither, clearly drawing the line between dreamer Maggie Gallager [Hilary Swank] & her slatternly, wrong-side-of-the-traler-park mother, sneering Welfare-abusing siblings, & their do-nothing, ain't-gonna-mess-up-mah-welfare  attitude.  -Million Dollar Baby- is a story about dreamers, abusers who use yet scoff at those who help them, and the broken-hearted.Frankie Dunn [Eastwood] ""is the best in the business"" according to narrator Eddie DuPris [Morgan Freeman, fine as frog-hair as a one-eyed ex-boxer], which is why Maggie wants him to train her, for her dream [no pink bunnies here!] is to become a World-class boxer.  Dunn refuses to train a ""girl"", but 31-year-old Maggie won't take ""NO!"" for an answer ... so Eddie helps her, while Dunn wrestles w/his sorrows, for his daughter won't answer his letters- sending them back 'return to sender', & the 1 boxer he had trained to win goes off w/another better-connected manager.  As Dunn taunts his priest [a crucial plot-point], Maggie develops into a contender w/a lethal left hook.  Finally giving into her dogged resolve, Dunn gives Maggie a Gaelic nickname [he reads Yeats in the original Gaelic, after all] & helps to add to her resolve as she boxes her way up and up and...Eastwood takes Maggie's fierce determination, Eddie's wry-but-involved hope for the kids in the gym, and Dunn's Catholicism & turns them into a shattering 180-degree plot twist that tests them all past their limits.  How each character deals w/those limits, & how they *matter* are more important than the 1-dimensional 'villains' they fight  - the real problems in this film, as in life, are personal, not external.  Each character pervails, tho not w/o their own loss ... & yet this film left me smiling thru the tears.If Eastwood doesn't win another Oscar, he's been robbed.  & yes i *have* seen everything it's up against!!",N/A
500727,"This is a movie that went largely unnoticed and has been bumbing around for quite some time.  Ray Liotta stars in this gripping thriller as Lee Ray, a sociopathic killer serving time on death row. He is secretly given a rare second chance when the brilliant Dr. Miles Copeland (Willem Dafoe) offers to use him as a test subject for a new drug designed to squelch violent tendencies. Lee agrees, and they go through the motions of lethal injection, and the former criminal assumes a new life with a new identity. Soon, however, things start to go horribly awry; Lee starts to become haunted by his violent past and doesn't know if he can maintain his control.Liotta is wonderful in this film giving one of his strongest performances since Goodfellas.  Co-Stars Steven Rea and Michelle Rodriguez as Lee's girlfriend.  A nice little psychological thriller.  The DVD is in 1.85 aspect widescreen and features one short making of feature and trailer.

Aileen decides that since she can't get a legitimate job she has no choice but to be a prostitute. I think that Aileen should have taken a good hard look in the mirror before deciding on that career path. This movie tries to elicit sympathy for Aileen's plight but all I felt was very sorry for her victims. I seems that Aileen had yet to realize that you can't resolve a bad past by using violence in the present.",Monster
635881,"Ahhh Christmas!I missed the movie in the theaters as a few comic fanatics kind of killed the interest.I would say if you expecting something on the level of the X-Men, then you might not like this film.  Afterall, Patrick Stewart, Ian McCellan, and Hugh Jackman are tough acts to follow.There are changes to the film.  For example Victor Von Doom was with them in space.  But overall they did make an effort to stay loyal.Of all the actors I have to give Michael Chiklis a special mention.  The guy was right on.  He has defined the role and I doubt any could have done it better.  You felt for him.The others?  Well Chris Evens did a good job and presented the annoying factor really well.Jessica Alba?  Beautiful as she is; she didn't really do much as the character for me.  But that is because I read the comics as a kid so I have preconceived notions.The addons for are ok.  You get the behind the scenes, a video diary that was interesting but went on a little too long.Again, I would say if you watch this film expecting the X-Men, Batman Begins, or Spiderman, you might be disappointed.Overall I am happy with the film.",Fantastic Four
855061,"This must be one of the most unpleasant horror films I've sat through in quite some time.  It depicts extensive drug use and its ugly aftermath, and it centers on one down on his luck guy named Jack who went from successful businessman to wasted junkie and I'm uncertain whether the director is trying to make an anti-drug statement or is simply showing us this for pure shock value.  The drug-taking scenes are harrowing, more so than the gory scenes when Jack goes bunkers and starts dispatching everyone with the jackhammer of the film's title.  The first half of the film is fine, and Aaron Gaffey's performance is believable and dedicated, it's the second half that falters, where we are introduced to a bunch of awfully acted characters that are there only to be massacred and unfortunately the lack of suspense adds to the tedium and pointlessness of it all.  The special effects are good though, and some will make you cringe (Jack's infected arm is barf-inducing).  Ultimately, the film is not as bad as most people say it is, as any horror flick that can make you feel like taking a shower afterwards must be doing something right, but with a more creative script this could have been a lot better.  For hardcore completists only.",N/A
675554,"Keira Knightley can bring integrity to any movie, but she especially does so here in this sweet, entertaining flick. She's a shining star on the rise.I'm not usually a big fan of Disney productions but I really liked this, since it was not your typical Disney flick. It was very entertaining and lavishly filmed, set in some absolutely spectacular locations, and starred some really top-notch actors. There were funny moments, sad moments and moments of high action, all nicely interspersed. The only thing I found a tad disappointing was the big fight scene towards the end, since it was a little bit tame and slow, but I accept that because this is a family movie, they couldn't really embrace full-on violence.I was more than satisfied with the slightly non-conventional (for Disney) ending...it ended the way it should, in a somewhat non-predictable way. And I loved the prince, too...he was very charming!Even though this is a family movie, it's intelligently enough written to appeal to mature adults as well, particularly fans of medieval and adventure films.",Princess of Thieves

There will be four boxed sets.  Season 1 will be split into two parts because of the numerous amount of episodes in that season.  Seasons 2 and 3 will be released as a single boxed set each.  Why buy this collector's edition?  It's packed with extras, two collectible cards, and has a nice folder out photo where the discs are stored.  It has exclusive content that WILL NOT be on the other boxed sets that come out in the future.  The quality puts the older VHS releases of He-man to shame since this is a digitally remastered set.

885611,"2004`s ""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up where 2001`s ""Ocean's Eleven"" left off.  When we last saw them, Danny Ocean and his hand-picked gang of professional thieves had successfully heisted multi-million dollar fortunes from three Las Vegas casinos, then headed their separate ways to start life anew as upstanding members of their respective communities.  However, they've since learned that the past has a way of catching up with a person no matter how much he may try to hide from it, when Tony Benedict, the Bellagio owner, still stewing over the money that was stolen from him three years earlier, shows up on Ocean`s doorstep demanding restitution.  He gives Ocean and his gang two weeks to come up with the $97 million they owe him or face the consequences.  Thus, Danny gathers up the gang once again and heads off to Europe, hoping to lift a few priceless art pieces to stave off certain death (though it`s never made entirely clear just how Benedict is proposing to carry out this rather grandiose threat).  What Danny doesn't count on is that he will be going up against two worthy adversaries - one a detective and the other a rival thief - who will give him more trouble than he ever bargained for.""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment for a whole host of reasons, most of them rooted in the format and structure of the film.  For this second outing, writer George Nolfi and returning director Steven Soderbergh have come up with a ha`penny storyline that lacks the intricacy and elegance of the tale in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  Not only does this caper seem haphazardly planned from beginning to end, but the resolution of it falls miserably flat, providing neither the amazement nor the amusement we expect to find in these kinds of stories.  Perhaps the idea of stealing a priceless Faberge Egg just doesn't rank up there in either chutzpah or style with knocking over a whole Las Vegas casino, and so the enterprise is more or less doomed to failure from the start.  Or perhaps the filmmakers simply failed to find enough for all these characters to do while they're roaming the streets of Amsterdam, Paris and Rome on what appears to be little more than an extended European vacation for some talented but woefully underused actors.  Moreover, there is a side foray involving Julia Roberts trying to pass herself off as Julia Roberts that is inane, incredible, preposterous and embarrassing.  The sequence is indicative of the lazy, half-hearted approach the filmmakers have taken towards both their material and their audience.It's also unpleasant watching the one character with even a smidgen of a moral code crossing over to the dark side at the end of the story - and asking us to get all misty-eyed and choked-up when it happens (at least when Anakin does it, we aren't expected to cheer him on from the sidelines).The high-priced, big-name actors - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon and Albert Finney - go through the motions, but they seem hopelessly cut adrift by the meandering, substandard screenplay.  Actually, only Catherine Zeta-Jones, as the detective and former girlfriend of Brad Pitt, is given anything of genuine substance to work with here.  All the rest are just picking up paychecks.In this type of film, plotting is everything, and the sad truth is that the plotting in ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pretty damn awful any way you slice it.  We`ve already had it sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)
872796,"The love story about two utterly different individuals speaks volumes about the human condition.  Eliska is a well educated woman who under normal circumstances would have little to do with Joza, a mere sawmill worker who lives in a small house with a dirt floor and no indoor plumbing.  The man does not own a single book nor reading material of any kind.  It is doubtful if he can even read at the level expected of a grade school graduate.  Alas, this is wartime and the Nazis are searching for Eliska because of her involvement in the resistance.  Hiding in the Czech boondocks and marrying the socially inferior Joza is her only viable alternative.  She eventually learns to love him and make the best of a less than ideal situation.  The term culture shock most appropriately describes Eliska's challenge to be accepted by those who perceive her to both be an outsider and a risk to their own safety.  Nazi soldiers, as expected, don't hesitate to kill those who hide enemies of the Third Reich.  Will Eliska be betrayed?  Can her relationship with the villagers ever become warm and intense?  We observe the process unfold over a period of a few years.  Anyone who enjoys romantic stories must see Zelary.  It may very well be ranked among your favorites of all time.  Yes, it is that good of a movie.  You should not be disappointed.One wonders why it is so difficult to find a copy of Zelary's music score.  It is among the best I've heard in years.  Could it be due to the fact that few Czech films are imported to the United States?  Whatever, I hope this might be rectified in the near future.",N/A

891351,"With the advent of the internet and new technologies all forms of entertainment have been going through a series of upheavals. Some are for the better, others are for the worse.So, The movie industry is no exception. For studios, producers and investors it's been riskier and riskier to try and produce blockbusters or release theatrical movies due to several factors, ranging from lack of resources to instability in economy and politics - even widespread piracy is the one to blame .So studios have been  producing  low-budget movies instead of expensive movies. Computers in part are the ones to blame too. CGI can practically generate any kind of (impressive or risible) image, so the magic or artistry of mechanical effects seems to be getting lost in the process. It's cheaper to hire unknown actors than famous ones. Filming schedules are getting shorter and shorter, as well as budgets and resources.A real horror fan knows that at least 80% of all horror movies made in this world are low-budget or homemade. Very few horror flicks are made with a lot of dough. Since the very beginning the HELLRAISER saga has followed this pattern, little money is spent but there's a lot of style. Once the effects were mechanical , photographic or  just physical - now they're mostly CGI, but still well made considering all sorts of restraints these brave movie makers face.Today movie watchers really don't know what they want to see.Do they want matter over substance or substance over matter or both? Lots of those so-called horror fans simply don't pay attention to what they watch - just check any forum sites and you'll see what I mean. When they pay attention to everything all they care about is spotting the mistakes and flaws seldom what makes the movie good. All we hear is this painful whine : ""the worst movie ever"" or ""it sucks big time!"". Hellraiser 1 & 2 are among the best and goriest horror movies ever produced, still lots of those horror movie ""lovers"" tear these original classic films to pieces. Others wanted to see more of PINHEAD. Hellraiser 3& 4 were made to show us more PINHEAD in action. The same people who demanded more PINHEAD screening time are the same who pan these movies.Even Clive Barker was crucified - he conceived the BOILER ROOM MASSACRE seen in HR3, for example, just to please his fans.  Because of all factors I mentioned above the studio and the producers decided to take a different path, and still are being criticized by those who now want to see more CENOBITES and PINHEAD in action. Humans are so difficult to please! That's why I love animals and hate people !Why don't you whiny fellows  invest whopping sums of money in the next HELLRAISER films or write good quality scripts or even try to direct the next instalments? If you never enjoyed HELLRAISER why bother watching the old and new episodes?I liked this movie as well as the other instalments . A good horror film is the one that holds your attention,that has flaws, that has good effects and interesting characters. And in my opinion this one has got it. About the teen characters : they have a reason to be there - mostly teens watch horror movies ! Only a handful adults watch horror flicks - I'm almost 40 (!). Teens are most times boring,reckless,and unstable people when they want to be and this movie show us that.I am so happy I have all HELLRAISER instalments on DVD / VHS and all the action figures too. I am not going to spoil anything by making remarks about what happens throughout the movie. It's up to you to watch and assess it. I did and I enjoyed it 100% !!! If you don't...

[A+]It should also be noted that any sports-entertainment segment which I deem to take up enough time to warrant inclusion in the review, will also be rated. As a general rule, these segments will have to last at least 7 minutes.BOOKERT/GOLDUST defeated CHRIS JERICHO/CHRISTIAN, LANCE STORM/WILLIAM REGAL & THE DUDLEY BOYZ in an Elimination Match to Win the World Tag-Team Titles: The first 6 minutes of this opener was disappointingly terrible. But following the practically simultaneous elimination of The Dudleyz & Storm/Regal, the remaining 2 teams showed why this bout should have been a normal tag match. The remaining 10 minutes was a hot & predominantly crisp bout, with excellent exchanges right up until the crowd-pleasing finale. Match Rating...7EDGE defeated A-TRAIN: I thought that this bout should have been a 'No Holds Barred' Match, in order to gain some sort of interest for this lifeless feud. Even at 7 minutes, this match went on too long. It ended with Albert using a chair to disqualify himself. Not as horrible as it could have been, but not that pretty either. Match Rating...5CHRIS BENOIT defeated EDDIE GUERRERO: A technical masterpiece, this bout showed why these 2 superstars are recognized as 2 of the best mat technicians ever. A match that highlighted the great intensity of both combatants, I'm going to be ultra critical & state that there wasn't enough fast-paced high-flying action thrown into this 17 minute match. Guerrero finally tapped to a crossface that Benoit applied from the opposite side than usual. Match Rating...8DAWN-MARIE, AL & TORRIE WILSON Segment: A segment has to be really good to be given over 15 minutes on a pay-per-view. This wasn't!!! Sure, some teenage males may have got something out of it, but even that could have been done in less time. I wonder how many parents would have been put off by this segment...??? The one thing the segment did succeed in doing, was heating up the crowd. That can't be denied, but almost one tenth of the whole event was spent on this. Segment Rating...3BATISTA defeated KANE: Folks, this was a painful 7 minutes to watch. This match was just plain horrible at times. Everything seemed wrong, even the timing of Flair's interference. I've been saying it for months; As good as Batista's potential is, he clearly is not ready for a singles push yet. Match Rating...4VICTORIA defeated TRISH STRATUS & JACQUELINE to Retain the Womens Title: This triple-threat match was extremely fast-paced early on & I was wondering how long the 3 combatants could keep it up for. Then I realized why it was so frenetic. When you're only given 4 minutes or so to work with, you have to go that fast. The entire ppv did run over time & I got the feeling that this was the match that suffered the consequences. I actually didn't mind the match until the ridiculous finish that saw Victoria pin Jackie following a belt shot to the head. Why wouldn't they let Victoria use that devastating finisher of hers? Match Rating...6KURT ANGLE defeated THE BIG SHOW to win the WWE Championship: Major props to Kurt Angle in this match. To show the intensity & enthusiasm that he did to get such a good 13 minute match out of The Big Show, is exactly why the WWE needs Kurt to be the face of the WWE in 2003. Genuinely well put together match with a crowd-pleasing ending. Match Rating...7TRIPLE H defeated SHAWN MICHAELS 2 Falls To 1, to win the World Heavyweight Title: Hard to rate, this match seemed to lack the freshness of the duo's SummerSlam bout, nor equal the brilliance of Triple H's '2 out of 3 falls' match against Steve Austin at No Way Out 2001. But comparing this match to 2 matches I rated a perfect 10, is definitely a compliment. The effort these 2 put into the 22 minute streetfight, 10 minute cage match & 8 minute ladder match cannot be questioned. Far from perfect, the sum total of 40 minutes was nonetheless entertaining, and at the end of the day, being entertained is why we as fans watch professional wrestling. Match Rating...8PPV RATING (48/80) = 60Looking at the key, I have basically given Armageddon a 'C+' grade & said that it was 'worth a watch'. It only just got into that rating range, yet I'm still happy with that overall grade & comment. It was an up-and-down pay-per-view event.",WWE Armageddon 2002

914191,"Schultze is a foreman at a salt mine in Germany who, along with his two friends Manfred and Jurgen, is laid off shortly before his retirement. The three clearly live to work, or rather, work fills the void in their drab, cookie cutter community. Day after day, they sit in the bar, staring into space, all purpose having been taken away for them. For Manfried and Jurgen, who are both married and have families, there is at least some distraction, but the lonely bachelor Schultze leads a solitary, unfulfilled existence polishing his garden gnomes and taking frequent naps. Although surrounded by salt, Schulze lacks this element and craves it: by heavily salting his food, and by ""tasting"" his salt lamp: a metaphor for his bland life.All this changes one night as he listens to the radio: turning off a report about lung cancer in miners (could this explain his persistent cough?), he happens across a Zydeco tune. He turns off the radio, then is drawn back. Grabbing his accordion, he plays the tune, at first slowly, then faster and faster. Instead of his traditional polka at the annual music fest, Schultze decides to shake things up a little and play Zydeco. Needless to say, this goes against the grain, and even evolves into a near-brawl as Schultze plays his Zydeco tune - one lout jumps up indignantly and yells ""N**** music!"" Schultze's small, self-conscious group of friends are the only ones to applaud his courage and embrace his newfound passion for Zydeco. The film's title is both a clever reference to Schultze's doldrums and to his newfound passion for Zydeco.Schultze finds an unlikely ally in Lisa, the new (female) bartender with a fiery disposition, who introduces herself by dancing a passionate, sensual flamenco dance on the tabletops and whispers a guttural ""Ole."" She is attracted to something in the lonely Schultze, and anonymously gives him a book about the Swamp Kings of Louisiana. Another is Frau Laurant, a resident at the nursing home where Schultze goes to visit his mother. She has a fondness for whiskey and breaking rules, and gets Schulze to live it up a bit, encouraging him to try his luck at the casino and arranging concerts for his new Zydeco music.The town is celebrating its fiftieth annual music celebration, and their sister town in Texas has invited one German musician to play at their German-American festival. Schultze is chosen for this honor, but upon arriving in Texas, he soon finds that German-Americans (who are obsessed by Lawrence Welk polkas and enormous steins of beer) aren't interested in actual German culture. He buys a small motorboat and sets off for the bayous of Louisiana, meeting an unlikely cast of characters along the way: a Czech band that, when he asks for petrol, hands him a glass of vodka, but then gives Schultze a ride to get gas for his boat, a kindly traveler that makes Schultze feel at home in the strange confines of Texas by inviting him into the hot tub (I laughed out loud at the sight of portly Schultze in a Speedo, his beer belly obscuring everything else), and a kind African-American woman and her daughter that invite Schultze into their bayou home for a feast of fresh crab and shrimp and a night out dancing.This film truly captures the wild flavor of the bayous and dancehalls of Louisiana: we hear older couples greeting each other in French, elderly couples dancing cheek to cheek to gentle Cajun fiddle, and the endless tree and water view of the swamps. In Texas, the locals are all portrayed as elderly and suspicious of anything new, much like where Schultze just came from in Germany. He finds kindness in unexpected places, and even though his passion arrived so late in life, he makes the most of his time left.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, at times a series of carefully composed shots that show the tedium and loneliness of Schultze's former life: his home, dwarfed by a pile of potash, the identical garage doors and driveways, the empty home, devoid of any personal touches. The soundtrack is an awesome collection of rollicking Zydeco and Cajun and the occasional German polka. This film struck a chord with me as soon as I heard about it: the first song I can remember hearing was the Zydeco standard ""My Toot Toot"" by Rockin' Sidney at age five, and ever since, I've been collecting Cajun and Zydeco.A delightful film, and although slow-paced, one that is ultimately rewarding. Contains two references to the ""N"" word in subtitles, but otherwise free of obscenity, sex, and violence.",N/A

345654,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Ikiru"" which means ""To Live"" is one of Akira Kurosawa's most beloved films. I also found it very touching.It is about an ambitious city hall employee  who develops an inoperable and incurable stomach cancer. Being terminally ill, he tries to make up for all the lost time he wasted by working too much. After he dies, his family looks back on the last months of his life trying to find out why he suddenly changed.I found the film to be very impressive in many aspects. Both as a period Japansese film and as one with nice scenery including a panchinko parlor.The DVD also has some great special features.Disc 1 contains the film with optional audio commentary by Stephen Prince, who wrote a book on Kurosawa's films. There is also a theatrical trailer.Disc 2 contains two documentaries about Akira Kurosawa.The first is part of a series and is about the film and includes interviews with the filmmakers including Kurosawa.The other is ""A Message from Akira Kurosawa""  the documentary is about Kurosawa himself and includes many interviews with him on the sets of many of his films.",N/A
531273,"An excellent cast is wasted in this overlong, self-important diatribe that showcases everything conservatives target liberals on (and I'm a liberal myself!).It has plot holes so large you could walk through them, a totally ludicrous ending, illogical subplots, silly characters (especially the ditzy, fawning female FBI agent), and several things that made no sense whatsoever and make me wonder how much the ""political insider"" who wrote it knows about American political parties' positions on issues.  In what universe would someone with Laine Hanson's (Joan Allen) views ever have been a Republican?  And it is strongly implied that her father (Philip Baker Hall), a former governor, was a Republican, yet he is adamantly opposed to any expression of religion.  Then there's the part where, after the governor of Virginia (CSI's William Petersen) tries in vain to rescue a drowning woman, the president's chief of staff (Sam Elliott) says to the Va. governor when he is not tapped to be vice president, ""we don't need another Chappaquiddick.""  Uh...sorry guys, but this isn't the same situation as Chappaquiddick.The film made the salient point that politicians' personal lives have no bearing on their competency, but the filmmaker hammers the point home in such a way with his lack of subtlety and the loooooong ending that he renders his message ineffective.  And while the film claims to be feminist, it seems to take every opportunity to degrade and humiliate the Joan Allen character.  As a previous Amazon reviewer said, there's something in this film to offend everyone.  I give it two stars only for the cast (they all tried mightily to overcome their material) and the authenticity of the sets.",N/A
893106,"Every scene is a Rembrandt painting. The visuals alone make this a rare experience. All parts were well cast. But the stand-out performance was Pacino's portrayal of Shylock. The delivery of what is, perhaps, Shakespeare's most poignant dialogue shakes one to the very core of one's being. The social commentary as well as the love-hate one feels toward Shylock is electric. Shylock, both victim and agent of misery, is the soul and conscience of everyman. One will want to watch this film again and again.",William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice

896204,"Well I watched two horror movies last night. One was Darkness, and then the other was Boogeyman. Neither was exactly heart- stopping, but alas the Boogeyman was a heck of a lot better. Boogeyman at least you could understand the true essence of the plot a lot more clearly, the actors definitely were better, and the creature at the end of the film did freak me out for a second. I think this movie made it seem like the Boogeyman is universal, just a bad spirit, and forms into what you imagine it to look like which is what this man, the protagonist in the film, did. I won't spoil the movie but the Boogeyman looks like a few things in his room put together. That was an interesting idea. The whole point of this is that it was something different to watch than the occasional house plagued with mad spirits thing they overdo. This movie was different and not too bad in their difference so I give it a solid three stars. Although in some parts of the movie you could feel lost, in the next scene you usually pick the pieces up quickly. The ending was the best part to me when he finally after running around his house so many times faces the creature once and for all. The ending they first chose, the one they stick with at the end is the best one. The other one, the ending they didn't put in the movie but let you see in the menu, was downright ridiculous. Where was his childhood friend in the second ending? And did you see how he looked standing in the window? He looks like a cartoon colored in! He didn't even look realistic. Now maybe that's because they weren't planning to put it in so they just didn't put much effort into it, they just showed a rough sketch of the second ending. I don't know but the second ending I didn't like at all. Trust me, the first ending, the one they show in the movie, is the best.Overall the movie was all right. I didn't hate it, but I won't be racing to the stores to own it as well. It was good to watch once, but probably never again, unless on t.v. one night when there's nothing else on.",Boogeyman
854903,"Travis Tritt is one of the best country artists of today.  His voice sounds great on this DVD and the performance and picture quality is excellent.  However, this DVD kind of leaves something to be desired.  The main problem is the set list that Travis plays; I don't know about everyone else, but I wanted to see him rockin' on that stage.  But he doesn't really start playing any rockin' songs until the last 3 or 4.  So almost the whole concert is the slower softer songs, which are good, but I just don't think it's a good idea to play that many in a row.  They kind of started to put me to sleep after awhile.Don't mean to sound negative, I was just hoping to hear Travis rock much more than he did on this DVD.",N/A

797205,"When the Nazis occupied France during WWII, part of the French population, rather than be imprisoned, tortured, or put to death, uneasily agreed to participate in the fascist hatred of the Jews that Nazism espoused.  The depiction of this French anti-Semitism in Mr. Klein, set in 1942, is a telling one, involving a cunning French art dealer who takes maximum advantage of Jews fleeing Paris by offering only the bare minimum amounts for their works of art they want to sell to raise money to leave.The dealer, Robert Klein, portrayed by Alain Delon, is arrogant, cocky, charming, and handsome--i.e., women fall for him at the drop of a hat, including the wife of a colleague (the colleague is played by Michel Lonsdale, one of the best, most underrated French actors around) who's now firmly entrenched in the ranks of the French anti-Semites.  This is tellingly on display at a ""theater amusement"" put on for the benefit of the occupying Nazis in which a large-nosed Jewish man (an actor obviously wearing a mask) is seen stealing gold chains from the necks of various women.  The ""theater piece"" is a cheap, tawdry affair that attracts those whose narrow minds gravitate to such drek.  Klein is there with his girlfriend and at the same time that he wishes not to be seen as a Jew, he has absolutely no interest at all in being identified with these riff-raff.The dilemma he finds himself in is that he is, in fact, being seen as a Jew; someone, he thinks, is setting him up for that since he receives in the mail a copy of a Jewish newspaper to which he never subscribed and in protesting to the police, a snowball effect occurs.The trail of activity he initiates, attempting to prove his non-Jewishness only serves, Kafka-like, to dig the hole deeper.  One of the best of the Joseph Losey films, Mr. Klein is a penetrating drama with excellent acting, perfect period re-creation, and brilliant plotting by Franco Solinas.  There is one point, however, that is puzzling.  Many people do not know that the Nazis executed a large number of Catholics; while Judaism was their primary target of destruction, Catholicism was not spared.  Yet in this film, a Catholic mass in Paris is depicted with all church officials in full regalia.Nevertheless, this is a great film, extremely well thought out with great casting and scathing social commentary that makes this resonate long after story's end.",Mr. Klein

275553,"""Annie Hall"" is a great film for the ages. Woody Allen does a great job portraying a man who questions modern relationships and struggles through life, so I think most people can relate to this film. With hilarious scenes like when Woody pulls out the author of the book to make one guy look like a schmuck is very funny, it's no wonder why this film won best picture. The film will have you on an emotional roller coaster ride that'll leave you speechless. You'll be laughing, crying, and even cheering for Woody through the film. Although the film is a bit paced, it's still a great movie. Overall, I highly recommend this one. The DVD has been released from MGM, and features a NON-ANAMORPHIC 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Anyway, it's still worth it to buy this film on DVD.",N/A

If I am not mistaken the same artist that did the graphics for FFX cutscenes is the same one for this movie.  The story is fairly simple, not much is said about the other characters, but having them in the movie is a big plus.  The fight scenes are so awesome and there are a few big surprises (may I say the Aeris death will still be the most talk about video game event in history).  I just wished this was more like a mini series,I still crave for more movies like this type perharps a FFX movie?  I love Square for making it right with this one.

952314,"A sad and funny film, Broken Flowers features Bill Murray as Don Johnston, a disaffected, lonely playboy who, with the encouragement of his neighbor Winston, goes on a quest to find four ex-lovers who might tell him about an alleged son that Don fathered nineteen years earlier. Confronting his past, he realizes his limitations and shortcomings as a man who, too scared and selfish to love, is afflicted with an aching hole in his heart.The film's plot device is amazingly simple. Once he agrees to search for the mother of his alleged son, the film is broken down into four episodes, each visit to a former girlfriend more painful than the previous one. And we see our Don Juan crushed with a sense of a life wasted on caprices and selfish, adolescent passion.The film is hilarious if you are fond, like I am, of Bill Murray's priceless expressions of disgruntled cynicism and irony. There is nothing forced or contrived in the film--its plot, its pacing, its themes. The film is assured and confident in what it has to say and as such has nothing in common with the predictable films that try to overwhelm you every second.One of the major themes of this film is the fear of attachment and as such I would compare it favorably to two other films--You Can Count On Me and The Station Agent.",Broken Flowers

This is great, wholesome entertainment that proves that it doesn't have to have sex and gore to entertain.On the other hand, this set gets the usual Universal short shrift treatment: cheap packaging, no booklet, zero special features, dual-sided disks of questionable quality, etc. Contrast this with all the extras on the Resuce Me DVD set after only one season!

633956,"The Pacifier (Adam Shankman, 2005)Shankman (A Walk to Remember) takes a number of different, rather tired ideas here and actually whips them into something that's surprisingly worth watching, at least on a few levels. You've got the single-male-raising-kids thing from Three Men and a Baby (including, yes, the diaper-changing scene), you've got the buddy-cop thing, you've got the international-intrigue thing, you've got the romantic-entanglement thing, you've got... well, all sorts of things. It all works relatively well, surprisingly.Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel of Pitch Black fame) is a Navy SEAL who's been laid up in the hospital after a snatch-and-grab went bad, resulting in the death of its target, Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan, presently in The O.C.). Upon his release from the hospital, Wolfe is informed that the project Plummer was working on is still MIA, but that it might be in a safety deposit box in Switzerland. Plummer's wife (Faith Ford of Murphy Brown) and Wolfe's boss (Chris Potter of Wild Card) are off to Switzerland to get the box, and Wolfe is left to look after Plummer's five kids. Cue hilarity.Yeah, it's predictable, and you've seen all these jokes before. Under the surface, however, Shankman is doing a very good job of connecting all those things mentioned above into one coherent narrative, and he does it very well. There is some good attention to detail paid in the movie, and it all sets up rather like a game of Mousetrap (for those of you old enough to remember the game Mousetrap, anyway). It's stupid, but it's fun, and surprisingly enough, it does contain a few surprises. Fun stuff, worth a rental. *** ",The Pacifier
705305,"This DVD is just good value. I have been an Ozzy fan since No More Tears mainly because I thought Zak Wyldes  sound was innovative and fresh, given at the time, pop metal and floyd rose tremelos were being done to death. Not sure what all the spitting is about though. Wouldnt want to be a roadie and pick up some foldback speaker Zak had laid one on. Maybe that mass of facial and head heir just keeps getting on and in his mouth. I guess there arent too many guitar heroes with a hair lip.Ozzy is just a legend. If you like his music, you cant deny you've watched some of the Osbournes reality TV show out of interest. So, to his credit, Im amazed this middle aged pom who generally wouldnt know if his pants were on backwards, can still sing in tune and jump around the stage for an hour. (although some of his jumping/clapping antics etc was a little out of time)The footage was really good, the sound wasnt compromised at all by it being live and it was good to see a concert without the hype of stage effects. Just good old music selling itself.There were some extras on the DVD which was OK. A bit too much time spent on Ozzy's bratty kids who I couldnt care less about. If I wanted to watch the antics of a couple of spoilt teenagers I'd hire a Dawsons Creek DVD. Couldve devoted a lot more time instead to the other band members or road/tech crew who work with Ozzy, not just have their credit card bills paid by him.Only real criticism about the concert is the set list. Whilst all the songs were good, would've liked a few off no Rest for the Wicked, but thats just a personal preference.Anyway, just a good value DVD. You'll definitely watch it more than once.",N/A

The bride is gonna kill the rest of the hit squad to get to him and she will either get her revenge or die trying.And while not having much of a plot or any suspense might leave most movies dead in the tracks, Kill Bill succeeds and succeeds with aplomb mostly because of Tarantino's love for the genre and talent for dialogue and Uma Thurman's tour de force acting and physicality.A lot of people are going to sit there and complain that the movie isn't about very much and that it's neither brainy nor socially redeming in the way...oh, I don't know, ""Schindler's List"" is but they'd be missing the point.

After watching The Shining (Original version) I decided to read the book to see what scary parts didn't make it to the movie.  I found that most of the book didn't make it to the movie.

You get a real sense of their emotional and career frustrations, of their conflicted relationships to their colleagues, and of the difficult business of developing their craft.

I'm glad that it's a live recording of the show instead of the taped versions like in Cats, it's so much better with the audience reactions and cheers.Bernadette Peters was phenomenal. People may have doubts with her singing abilities, but we can say with certainty that as a performer she's undoubtedly if not the best one of the best. She has such a presence that just grabs you completely and she has a great comedic timing She is perfection. Another stand out is Joanna Gleason who won a Tony for her role. She has such a great timing. She never missed a beat, all her lines were spot on.The songs were all wonderful and probably the most hummable collection of songs by Stephen Sondheim. But his trademark profound and meaningful lyrics are still there. Children will Listen is a great song that has a very observant lyrics. Agony was just plain hilarious. And the titular song, Into the Woods, is catchy and a great opener.The Act1 is funnier and lighter. Bernadette Peters's entrance as the Witch was memorable. I love how the show mocked itself (""You talk to birds...?"" ""Rapunzel, what kind of name is that?""). Really funny script.

50818,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based upon Harper Lee's wonderful book, is one of the finest films of all time.  Gregory Peck portrays Atticus Finch, the small town lawyer who defends a black man (played with depth and character by the recently deceased Brock Peters) and teaches his children about judging people by the ""content of their character.""The story is seen through the innocent eyes of Atticus' young daughter ""Scout,"" and is set in the early part of the twentieth century.  The story of Finch's defense of Tom Robinson is intertwined with Scout's remembrance of growing up with her brother Jem and  friend Dill and their encounter with Boo Radley, a neighbor recluse considered by most to be insane.  Boo is played by a very young Robert Duvall in his first major (albeit small) film role.Like the book, the movie has genuine heart.

Ben Stiller is White Goodman, a cocky, wealthy and heavily built owner of the hottest gym going. Vince Vaughn is Peter LaFleur, the owner of Average Joe's gym which is old, worn out and in finanical debt to its ears. White and Peter have different philosophy as it relates to human conditioning and outlooks on life. White feels if you're not buff or in shape, you're a loser. Peter is for everyone regardless of what shape their in.The bank gives Peter a notice that the gym is about to be foreclosed if he does not come up with $50,000. If peter fails to come up with this money, White will use the gym to add on to his gym. Peter and his crew try desperately to come up with strageties to make the money, but fall flat each time until one of the guys encouraged the group to get involved in a dodgeball competition. Of course, Peter is pretty much the only guy on the team that has any athletic abilities. In fact the team was so bad that they got schooled by a girl scout's team in order to qualify for the touranment but the girls got disqualified b/c one of the girls failed a drug test. Go Figure. Luckily, the team did get some help as a coach (Rip Torn) comes and shows them the ropes on how to play the game. Of course, that took many, many practices to even get them even close to being competitive.  The coach used wrenches and screwdrivers to as ball to help them practice.  Obvisously, you would want to be good enough to dodge these things or else you'll be in some serious pain. In addition, the woman who entered Average Joe's gym to give him his notice joined the team b/c she hated White just as bad as he did and was you would expect, Average Joe's overcame the odds to advance in the finals of the tourament. However, their cinderalla story was in some serious jeporady. The coach gets killed in a casino, some of the team members had priorities elsewhere, and White strongly encouraged Peter a deal he couldn't refuse in selling his gym. However, against all odds the team did prevail, keep the gym, and run White's gym out of business. White ends up the guy that he thought was a complete loser as he sat in his sofa eating a pound of ice cream grieveing over the loss.

638959,"So. The movie's getting a lot of bad press by folks saying that the movie is nothing like the books.DUH. You can't go to a movie based on a book and expect the book, for the simple fact that it's a movie.Besides, I find that the people who are griping about it tend to be completely ignorant about the story's history. You see, the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" story was originally a BBC radio series, and following this incarnation has been a set of five books, a video game, a BBC television miniseries, and most recently another BBC radio series and the big-budget movie I'm reviewing.My point is that I have seen the BBC series, read all of the books, played the game, and heard the radio series. There are some huge differences from one version to the other. Events happen in different orders, things happen differently, and there are some things in the books that simply do not happen in the radio series, and vice versa. Characters behave differently.My other point is that you don't have to experience all of the story's different incarnations to know this. All you have to do is pick up any copy of the first book and read the introduction. Adams was always the first to say that there were contradictions and inconsistencies.  In other words, you have to be painfully ignorant to be a fan of the books and still complain about any inconsistencies in the movie.Anyway, on with my review.It was good. Everything was designed beautifully, Mos Def played a better Ford than I thought he would, and it was just overall a very good ride.However, it's not perfect.Adams, before his untimely death in 2001, went through many drafts for a screenplay before arriving at the one that was used for the movie.I think that, considering that the first audience was going to be largely American, he tried to overcompensate by altering much of the humor to fit what would be expected by us. There are no sex and fart jokes, thank god, but it's still different. What I found most disappointing was the fact that the movie is no different from many other modern ""comedies"", in that it is hilarious for about thirty minutes and becomes serious the rest of the way.(I even found ""Meet the Parents"" to be guilty of this--a decent movie, yes, but hardly a comedy.)In other words, much of the British humor that made the radio series and books so wonderful is lost. This isn't unique to the movie, though, because if you read the books you'll notice that Adams get kind of preachy and not quite as funny as he gets towards the end of the ""trilogy"".There is an entire extra sub-plot that doesn't exist in the books, the BBC movie, or the radio series. However, there is nothing wrong with this, because the plots of the aforementioned incarnations are often wildly different anyway, and so differences are to be expected.Overall, it was a good movie. However, it was wildly different from any of the previous incarnations of the story, and perhaps a little too Americanized.I give it four out of five stars, thinking that, perhaps, some things are better left out of Hollywood.",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

665115,"The Tholian WebThe USS Enterprise finds her sister ship, the USS Defiant in unsurveyed territory at her last reported position. The vessel which vanished without a trace three weeks ago is investigated by Captain Kirk and a boarding party consisting of Spock, McCoy and Chekov. They discover upon beaming over to the vessel that the Defiant's crew had killed each other apparently during a mutiny on the ship. The landing party found out after further investigation of the vessel that it was mysteriously dissolving prompting Kirk to order the landing party be beamed off the ship immediately.The space that the Defiant had been drifting in was playing havoc with the Enterprise's transporter system, allowing for only three members of the landing party to be beamed off the fading vessel, Kirk elected to stay behind enabling them to return safely aboard the Enterprise. Scotty attempted to beam Kirk back to the Enterprise when the Defiant suddenly disappeared. Spock used the computer to calculate that Kirk would be able to be retrieved during the next period of spatial interphase, which would occur in two hours and twelve minutes.Chekov, who experienced momentary stabs of pain while onboard the Defiant went mad and was removed from the bridge making it extremely urgent for Dr. McCoy to isolate and treat the madness which was apparently affecting the Enterprise crew just like it had affected the Defiant's crew. The rescue mission was disrupted by a Tholian ship claiming that the Enterprise had violated territory belonging to the Tholian Assembly. Spock relayed to the Tholian Commander that the Enterprise was on a rescue mission, the Tholians had no problem in allowing Spock and the Enterprise to complete it.The rescue mission failed due to the Tholian vessels entry into the area. The Tholians who don't tolerate deceit or lack of punctuality fire on the Enterprise, forcing Spock to return fire thereby damaging the Tholian ship. The Enterprise who was damaged herself in the Tholian's attack starts to drift. A second Tholian ship appears and both ships begin to weave a web of energy around the crippled Enterprise. Spock who is forced to take command of the Enterprise deals with the loss of the Captain and the affect that it has on the crew.The race against time was on for Scotty to repair the damage sustained in the Tholian attack and for McCoy to find a cure for the madness that was tearing the crew apart before the Tholians completed their web of energy trapping the Enterprise for good. Despite rising tensions and further episodes of madness amongst the crew, Scotty is able to repair the ship and McCoy finds an antidote to the madness. The Enterprise is able to escape the Tholian's web and retrieve Kirk alive and well.",N/A

She-Ra was definitely one of my favorite shows and I had most, if not all, of the action figures.  I'm so glad something of She-Ra has finally been released on DVD and I give it 5 stars just for that.  I'm sure I will love it.By the way, She-Ra and He-Man would not make a cute couple because they are twin brother and sister.Since writing the above, I have watched the DVD several times.  The quality of the picture was good, I found no fault with it.  As for the bonus material, I thought there could have been more about She-Ra.

Boring characters, except the lead girl, she was the only saving grace in the film, and the only convincing character. That's my opinion.

871978,"Although I enjoyed the Chappelle Show Season 1 set, I was a bit dissapointed and thought that they could have included more in terms of extra bits, behind the scenes footage, etc. Its become common since DVDs became more common, and these kind of extra features have almost become expected of filmmakers and TV broadcasting companies. With that said it was refreshing to get my hands on Season 2 of the Chappelle Show and see a few extra goodies that totally made the purchase that much more worth it.Highlights on this set for me included Dave's 'Training Day' ride with Wayne Brady, Charlie Murphy's Rick James segments, and the Charlie Murphy bit about playing ball with Prince. Included in the extras are several great segments, including more Charlie Murphy interviews, an extended Rick James interview, and some behind the scenes standup of Dave's that is not included during the show. On the negative side and worth note is the fact that Comedy Central felt it necessary to throw a plethora of ads at the viewer on this DVD set, and I personally was able to overlook this small issue because the rest of the total package is just fantastic.Summary:Pros- Extra content beyond the basic episodes, and the episodes themselves.Cons- Lots of annoying Comedy Central ads.Overall- Despite the ads, this is a great purchase and will have you laughing yourself silly over and over.",N/A

881598,"The first season of Tyra Bank's America's Next Top Model is now on DVD.  In some ways Season One seems like a long time ago and then at other times it seems like it was just yesterday.  The first season premiered in 2003.  This is the season that Adrienne Curry won the competition.  Adrienne came a long way on the series.  She was a little rough around the edges and her Joliet, Illinois accent hurt her when it came time to film the Fresh Looks commercial.  Adrienne came across as humble and down to earth and when she came down with food poisoning she still showed up for the judging.The show begins with the 10 girls living in the house.  The various girls are very different and clash.  Elyse was the wild card of the bunch.  She always referred as being an intellect and being intellectually superior to the other girls.  On top of that, the episode of the runway training she proclaimed that if she didn't win the contest she would enroll in medical school and on one occasion she said she didn't even want to be a model and said to the camera, ""eliminate me please.""  Why was she there?  Elyse was a favorite with the judges because she nailed most assignments, but she wore everyone out with her constant references to her intellect.Kesse was a cute little African-American college student who looked like she could have been Tyra's little sister.  She desperately wanted to be away from Arkansas and out on her own.Shannon was a beautiful blond who felt that she could be a strong Christian and a successful model.  She had so many hang ups about being provocative and issues with various things it was hard to imagine her fitting in in the modeling industry.The other blond, Nicole was head over heels in love with her BMX bike riding boyfriend who she left behind to participate in the competition.Giselle, an 18 year old who spent most of her life as a dancer was pressured by the judges to build her confidence. The young woman fished for compliments and what eventually did her in was a comment she made during a photo shoot.  She said, ""I think I look more like a dancer than a model.""Ebony pushed the envelope.  Her trademark bald head made her stand out from the rest, but her anger issues and inner tension was something that even the judges picked up on.  She also tested the roommates by asking them if it was okay if her lesbian lover came to the apartment to visit.Robin was a 27 year old Christian member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.  The oldest member of the group, she was another strong Christian and she often reminded the group of her believes and had no fear in telling them what did and did not agree with and was open about her views about lesbians and homosexuality. The judges also chided Robin about her beauty pageant background.The contests are given assignments and then judged by a panel of celebrity judges.  Janice Dickerson, who is considered by many to be the first super model, serves as a judge.  Tyra Banks, the shows creator is a judge.  The other regular judge is Baby Phat Fashions owner Kimora Lee Simmons.  Various guest judges sit in on each episode.  Tyra actively participates in most episodes bonding with the girls and sharing her experiences with them.The show is a lot like  a soap opera and watching the episodes on DVD can be addictive.  There were 9 episodes filmed during the first season and all of the episodes appear on the box set in order of air date.  The three discs are enclosed in individual plastic clip covers.  The special features on disc three include the following featurettes-,""Casting Call,"" ""Reliving The First Season,"" and ""The Two Jays.""If you like the show, are interested in the modeling industry, a Tyra fan or a fan of one of the models on the show you will really like this box set.

951665,"I fell in love with the Firefly series from the very first episode. But the FOX network being the pathetic clowns they are went and canceled a series that had already been building up a huge fallowing. I was crushed when they canceled Firefly but not surprised. The FOX network's landscape is full of creations canceled due to lower then wanted ratings. FOX has this thing, they will cancel a show even if millions are watching, just because they find joy in crushing people's sand Castles. Sometime later when the series DVD came out. The shows popularity went up even higher then before! I was lucky enough to buy the set the day of it's release, while others had to find stores with a current supply of the DVD's. I remember the set moving up into the fifth all around rating on Amazon.FOX, like others, now sees that rating are only a small part of the overall viewing audience. DVD's are literary Gold! Films like the very first (Blade) movie which did not do all that well in the threaters, made Gold on DVD sales.That being said, this movie is so much better then I was hoping it to be. I was hooked into the plot right from the opening scene. Seeing the FireFly transport ship called the Serenity flying towards a planet with the epic Modern/Western music playing in the background. It was like I found home again. I remember waiting for months and months for the show to hopefully come back. Then waiting more and more months for the DVD set. So seeing a full-pledged movie on the Firefly and her crew was so perfect for me.Now I am not going to post a review telling you anything about the plot, because I always hated those people that went way too far into the plot before you have even had a chance to see the movie. All I will say, is I cried at the end of this movie.I hope so mega much that there will be sequels to this movie. I will watch them until I die,  that is how much I love this story. If you loved the show, you will feel right at home. If you are new to the whole story, then you will find your way to being a fan.Please buy as many DVD's as you can! So all of us fans will have more chapters in the story to look froward to.The production studies make most of their profit on DVD sales, so it is never too late to support this series.Just give Serenity a chance.

507431,"Read reviews above for many great comments!  Seems the better the movie, the better the reviews!My two cents here!Look at the list of fine actors who rejected the""Norman Maine---great actor on the decline"" ...role!  Montgomery Clift and Cary Grant just being two of them.  Why were these many good and great actors so afraid of playing a real role?Here, Cary Grant did us a great service in turning this role down after he apparently initially accepted it.  He was a good actor---sometimes great.But James Mason was almost always great, even in lesser roles.And Mason was ahead of his time in not ""protecting"" his image, by only taking ""good guy"" or ""winner"" roles.  He played edgy characters many, many times.Judy Garland's performance would have  swallowed up any merely good male lead.But Mason's performances has many nuances to it. He is totally believable as the experienced actor coaching the novice.Only a great actor could NOT be overshadowed by Garland's great voice and personal vulnerability.Marlon Brando, in a new style of acting, was different enough to edge Mason out of the Oscar award.  But in retrospect, I think Mason was better than Brando, and both leads in A Star is Born deserved Oscars.",A Star Is Born VHS

878339,"This ""Flintstones"" package marks the midpoint between the ""pre-Pebbles"" and ""post-Pebbles"" eras, and as a lifelong fan who's seen all of these at least twice over, I'm delighted to follow the show as it unfolded. By now, Fred and Barney were at their prehistoric Kramden/Norton best, and the buildup to Pebbles' arrival was- to these much older eyes- surprisingly subtle as well as funny. Hanna-Barbera knew what it was doing and really pitched the show to both kids and their parents. Both the writing (with help from two proud Looney Tunes alums) and animation (headed by a former Walter Lantz director) are sharp and better-timed. Even one-shot guest characters (Grandma Dynamite, fitness expert Brick Boulder) are quirky, while the wisecracking bird/animal appliances are a sideshow in themselves.Some of my all-time favorite episodes are a part of this season. There's ""Dino Goes Hollyrock"", where Fred brings Dino to the TV studio for a guest appearance on the ""Sassie"" show; ""The Twitch"", featuring prehistoric teen idol Rock Roll; ""Baby Barney"" with Barney in baby booties as ""Little Tex"" (to please Fred's rich uncle); ""High School Freddie"" (""Flintstone! Flintstone! Rah-Rah-Rah!""), ""Foxy Grandma"" (Grandma Dynamite, the little old lady bank robber, moonlights as Fred's maid), and many more.Don't miss ""The Buffalo Convention"", with guest bird Doozy, the Talking Dodo, who- in a great nod to Chuck Jones' ""One Froggy Evening""- won't talk in front of anybody but his owner (Fred)...until he tips Wilma off on where the boys have sneaked off to for their convention: ""Gawwk! Frantic City! Frantic City! Doctor's a plumber! Gawwk!"" That's just one ""Flintstones"" line that stuck with me the way ""Lucy"" or ""Seinfeld"" bits did with others. ""Hawaiian Spy"" (with guest star Larry Lava) and ""Dial S for Suspicion"" (a great Hitchcock send-up even better than the ""Brickrock"" episode in Season 1) are two more that show how this really was an adult, as well as kid, comedy. Finally, those baby cues- a pair of booties here, a visit from Betty's baby nephew there, the parade of maids- all lead up, beautifully, to Pebbles' arrival.As with the previous volumes, a couple of mini-features are tacked on. Kitsch fans will be impressed by the incredible collection of Flintstone toys and tchotchkes, as displayed by Scott Shaw! (the ! is a part of his name), the rotund cartoonist who's done more Flintstone drawings and designs (cereal boxes, posters, et al.) than anyone. The other item is a tribute to the late Bea Benaderet and Jean VanderPyl, the wonderful voice artists who did Betty and Wilma. (Note that Bea left soon after this season to head the cast at ""Petticoat Junction""- her giggly, lovable voice was missed.)Yes, I did notice that Episode 26, ""Big Move"" (with some funny bits involving Fred and his new, wealthy neighbor, Reggie Van Slaten- yet another Gleason takeoff) was a bit shorter, and I'm not crazy about double-sided DVDs. But these are minor quibbles. If you're a lifelong 'Stone-head or if you haven't seen them since grammar school, this is for yabba-dabba-you!",N/A

247239,"""Coming to America"" is a 1988 movie that has become an extremely popular movie on the cable channel circuit.  Much of the reason for this popularity is it marked somewhat of a turning point in star Eddie Murphy's career.  The turning point was that this became a movie that would widen Eddie's appeal among different audiences.  Although there still is some foul-language in this movie, it surprisingly isn't Eddie Murphy's character who is dishing it out.  While I wouldn't put ""Coming to America"" in the category of Eddie's ""Family"" movies of recent years (i.e. ""The Nutty Professor"", ""Dr. Dolittle"", ""Daddy Day Care"" and ""The Haunted Mansion""), there still is less foul language than in previous Murphy movies.  But overall, with a good cast of supporting characters, some nice spins, and an interesting setting for the story, this might be the best all-around movie that Eddie Murphy has done.The premise of the story is as follows (this might be a spoiler):  Eddie Murphy plays Prince Akeem, the sole heir to the throne of the fictitious African nation of Zamunda.  The movie opens with Akeem facing an arranged marriage to a woman he has never met.  Akeem immediately has doubts about marrying someone he has never met and tries to get his father, King Jaffe Joffer (played terrifically by James Earl Jones) to let him find his own bride.  The King is convinced that Akeem needs to ""Sow his wild oats"" and agrees to postpone the wedding.  Akeem has other ideas - he wants to travel someplace to go find a bride of his choosing.  With his royal servant, Semmi (another great performance, this time by Arsenio Hall), Akeem decides to go to the United States to find a bride.  In order to get someone who will care for him as a person rather than a prince,  Akeem decides that he and Semmi will live as commoners (even though Semmi is a Servant, he apparently is used to the good life) as the settle into their new residence in Queens, New York.  After some rough bumps, Akeem finds a woman named Lisa McDowell (played by Shari Headley) whom he feels would be his perfect bride.  In an effort to pursue Lisa, Akeem decides that he and Semmi will get jobs at Lisa's father's Fast Food restaurant - McDowells (a ""spin"" on McDonalds that is spun brilliantly by the writers) in the guise of African Exchange Students.  In Akeem's quest to win over Lisa, he faces many hurdles:  Lisa has a boyfriend named Darryl Jenks (in another brilliant performance by Eriq La Salle);  Lisa's father Cleo (in yet another brilliant performance by John Amos) whom he wants to his daughter to marry Darryl; Semmi whom despite being a servant is not acclimating to life as a poor Fast Food worker in Queens; and eventually Akeem's own Father whom will eventually get wind of his son's scheme.There are also two interesting spins in this movie (and this may also be a spoiler).  Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are going to play several other minor characters throughout the film.  These performances, while not central to most of the storyline are very entertaining.  Even if these minor characters were not a part of the film - and even if they weren't played by Murphy and Hall, this would still be a good movie.  The other spin comes from a cameo appearance by the ""Duke"" brothers from a previous Eddie Murphy film, ""Trading Spaces"" (played by Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy).  There is a very interesting spin how the Duke brothers cameo is worked into the movie.  You will need to have seen ""Trading Spaces"" to understand how they spin this into the movie.  If you have seen ""Trading Spaces"", you will realize how brilliantly this was done.As mentioned above, there are some terrific supporting character performances.  While Eddie is still brilliant in his role of Prince Akeem, the performances of Semmi (Arsenio Hall), King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones), Darryl Jenks (Eriq La Salle) and Cleo McDowell (John Amos) really stand out.  In particular, I think John Amos delivers one of his best performances as Cleo.  He comes across very believable as the ""father"" of Lisa - much of this due to the charm that Amos delivers to the character.  The same thing can hold true for James Earl Jones - he seems perfect to play the role of the King (much due to his trademark voice).  There are also two outstanding minor character performances.  We see Samuel L. Jackson in one of his earliest roles do a brilliant job playing a gunman who attempts a holdup of the McDowell's restaurant.  In another minor role, Louie Anderson plays one of the workers at the Fast Food restaurant.  While I'm not the biggest Louie Anderson fan, every time that Louie was in a scene in ""Coming to America"", it was funny.  I kind of wish they gave Louie more dialogue and fit him into the storyline of the movie.  Another note, a young Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a boy getting a haircut.Perhaps the only negative is the opening of the movie.  I thought the first few minutes of the movie are drawn out.  Once Akeem makes the decision to call off the wedding, that is where the action will pick up.I also enjoyed the New York City and Queens setting of the movie.  I think it helped the storyline and was almost a perfect contrast to the African Country of Zamunda.Overall, this is a very good movie to see.  It's the kind of movie you will definitely want to see more than once.  Although this film appears on Cable television several times a year, the uncut version available on DVD is going to have so much more to offer.  This is a highly recommended movie - whether this is your first time checking it out or whether you have seen it multiple times.",N/A
787887,"Problem Child -The movie is basically about this young couple that decide to adopt a child, but they are duped into taking the adoption center's most troubled child, Junior, of them all. All hell breaks loose as Junior reaks havoc with insane practical jokes and low brow humor. This movie does fall into some typical cliches, stereotyped characters, and a lot of bad acting (with exception of John Ritter). Overall, this film is still pretty solid for a few laughs, but I wouldn't expect too much out of it.Problem Child 2 -The sequel picks up where the last movie left off with Ben and Junior moving to a new neighborhood and trying to start a new life. Along the way, Ben tries to date various single women but they are all scared by Junior's antics. A greedy rich woman takes interest with Ben, but Junior soon finds himself being persecuted by another local problem child, older classmates, and his soon to be new mother. Sparks will fly in this laugh out loud comedy for the ages. I do admit though that this film falls under a lot of the same flaws as its other film did with bad acting, cliches, and stereotyped characters. Overall, if you're looking for a comedy that doesn't require a lot of thought, then I highly recommend it.Both films are on a single DVD.

The story is extremely complicated (reportedly not even the writers, which included William Faulkner, knew who killed whom), but it doesn't matter; what makes the movie so great is the dialogue, especially the wisecracking tough guy Bogie. Lauren Bacall plays opposite him and is just as tough and sinister. Virtually the whole movie takes place at night, adding to the suspense and netherworld depravity. Although the plot is unwieldy, confusing, and untidy, this is a great film noir masterpiece. Definitely worth a watch.Another quote: ""My, my, my! Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains.

367377,"HELLRAISER is one of the greatest horror films to grace the screen, thanks to the presence of its director, Clive Barker, who also wrote the story it was based on, The Hellbound Heart. Thanks to its success, it established its evil nemesis, Pinhead, as a cult favorite. He along with his cohorts, the Cenobites, established themselves as the ultimate terror. You don't want to cross paths with these creeps.HELLBOUND picks up where the last HELLRAISER left off, as Kirsty (once again the pretty Ashley Laurence) awakens in a mental hospital, where a detective explains that her boyfriend has been sent home, but that he has more questions for her about what went on in ""daddy's house"". However, Kirsty has little idea that her therapist, Dr. Channard (played on-the-mark by Kenneth Cranham), is about to unlock the gateway once again due to his unnerving obsession with the history of the puzzle box, and of the story that Kirsty has told him. He decides to try something, as he puts a patient on a bed with chains with a nasty blood stain (from the first movie, it was Julia's) and, to his shock, a rather skinless Julia (the delicious Claire Higgins) emerges and sucks the life out of the patient. She explains herself to some degree, and Dr. Channard agrees to help her (you will see the similarities between what happened with Frank in the first movie and with Julia in this one, but they end to a certain point). One of the patients in the hospital, a mute, is given a puzzle box and she unknowingly unlocks the gateway to hell, and so emerge the Cenobites with their fearless leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley, nuff said!). But Pinhead says they were not summoned by hands, but by desire, and so now they're after Dr. Channard. Julia is brought to life after a series of murders by her resurrect her back to normal human state. After such, she tricks Dr. Channard, who ultimately becomes a force to be reckoned with in hell. He becomes a Cenobite, but wants to run things his way, so he tries to massacre the Cenobites (yes, that includes you Pinhead) and briefly takes over things after the diabolical Julia devised a plan that, well, backfired on her. It's up to Kirsty to help her and the mute, Tiffany (played cleverly by Imogen Boorman) escape the clutches of the evil Dr. Channard. Once again, the ending leaves the  door wide open for the next chapter of HELLRAISER, titled HELL ON EARTH. After Julia is finally rid of, and Channard and cohorts are sent back to hell, someone else is going to find the puzzle box...and ultimately become the next hapless sap to open the gateway.This sequel almost nearly matches its predecessor, and is one of the most satisfying sequels in recent years, although I've yet to see how SAW II matches its predecessor. But if you love Pinhead and think the first HELLRAISER was good stuff, you're 'bound' to love this sick, twisted, and more gory second entry.",Hellraiser 2: Hellbound VHS
192276,"A movie that actually has that line in it is already deserving of at least three stars.  Uncle Sam is one entertaining film.  Notice I say ""entertaining"" and not ""scary"".  A few of the one star reviewers apparently expected this to be scary, but all you have to do is merely look at the coverbox of this film, and anyone with common sense knows that this isn't meant to be taken seriously.  Uncle Sam is directed by Blue Underground founder, Bill Lustig.  Lustig directed Maniac Cop, which this film is very similar to.  B movie legend Larry Cohen wrote the script.  Sam was ""killed"" by friendly fire in the Gulf war, and once his body is shipped home, he decides he isn't gonna rest in peace.  Sam is a hardcore patriot(and psychotic and child molester), and blames his ""death"" on Un-American Americans(he indirectly refers to hippies and draft dodgers as ""cowards"").  Once out of the coffin, he dons an Uncle Sam outfit and wreaks havoc at his hometown's annual 4th of July celebration.  His targets include the draft dodging schoolteacher, the cop moving in on his wife, a couple of flag burning punks, a tax cheater, and a guy who makes a mockery of the national anthem.  As ridiculous as this plot sounds, and as easy as it may be to lump this film into the category of silly horror flicks like Leprechaun and Jack Frost, Uncle Sam seems to have a little more class.  Though it's not meant to be taken seriously, it's not trying to be outright comedy like the aforementioned films.  The style is more in the vein of an 80s slasher flick without taking itself as seriously as one.  Bill Lustig knows the genre.  He may not have directed many films, but he's extremely immersed in the horror/exploitation genre.  He's made his own contributions in the early 80s, and of course he runs Blue Underground.  Before the end credits he even has a dedication to Lucio Fulci(this film was made right about the time of his death in 96).  Plus, with Cohen on board as the writer, we have a real dynamite combination.  That's not saying the movie is perfect.  There's a blind, crippled kid who shows up about an hour into the film possessing a psychic ability and a strange bond to Sam which is never fully explained.  All in all this character is completely pointless and does nothing at all for the movie.  Genre fans will be pleased to see Bo Hopkins, PJ Soles and Robert Forster in small roles.  You eventually get a good look at Sam's face in the last ten minutes or so of the film and I must say he does look kinda creepy.  Definitely one you should see.

831547,"I loved watching ""Unsolved Mysteries"" back in its TV heyday.  But, this ""Miracles"" edition is just too uncomfortable to sit through.  These stories on ""Miracles"" are more for the weak-minded, naive, religious-types, than those with reasonable common sense.  Don't get me wrong.  I do believe in God.  Absolutely!  God answers my questions because he's granted me the ability to process realities to know what my answers will be.  I am fortunate to have things go my way.  But, I do work for it, I don't expect anyone to just provide for me.  I'm sure God appreciates that I make my own effort to excel positively, as I do.I really don't believe that there are times when God will choose to intervene a pending tragedy, when so many times, He will not.  Remember the Tsunami, just after Christmas, in a heavily Christian environment?  Yeah right, God was there for them, wasn't He?  Fate is nothing more than the luck of the moment.  I'm sure God will say that we did something to our earth and caused this to happen, so it IS our fault.I don't go around making myself sound ignorant by saying: ""God has put his hand into the intervention of this particular tragedy of which we have been spared"".  Give me a break!  I'm sure, in most of these questionable stories on this ""Miracles"" collection, there is a scientific explanation for what has happened.  Or, they are just well crafted hoaxes.  I wouldn't doubt that there could be desperate church parishioners trying to create an illusion of a godly presence in their church just to drum up some attention.If one person said that a ""miracle"" happened, we'd think he or she was crazy, but if 3 or more people say that a ""miracle"" happened, that now makes it more possibly true?  If 5 or more people say so, then it must be a fact!I think some people give up their investigations too early, and therefore want to comfort themselves by saying that God did this.  God might even say: ""Hell, I had nothing to do with that! People are sure quick to give in to the fantasy of the fabricated power of prayer.""These tabloid-worthy stories of the ""Miracles"" collection somewhat reduces the integrity of the show's appeal to me.  I'm glad this religious crap was separated from the others so that I can enjoy some of the more reasonable tangibility of the other stories.We all have a conscience.  This is what controls our decisions to do good or bad.  Man invented something as to create an alternative to interpret how we deal with our conscience.  And he called it ""religion"".  And man learned how to make money from this cash-cow called religion. God is just another entity of commercialism.  I think we really did forget what Christmas is all about.  Today, Christmas is about Santa Claus and sales figures to compare to sales of the previous years, and Easter is about Easter bunnies and Easter eggs.  Good Friday, to some people, is just some great long three hour lunch hour at the bar.Man learned that he could use religion to take advantage of people.  The rich and the poor.  Yes, especially  the Poor!!  People who have next to nothing, who give what they can to a church or religious entity that already has so much more than them.  I believe God and I both kick back and laugh at that.There are many facets of religion, and they all expect you to make a sacrifice (usually your money), to show your faith.  Because, man knows that some people are weak and insecure, so they need something to believe in because they don't really believe in themselves. And religious parents instill this insecurity into their children so they'll be messed up for life too (unless they start to learn to process common sense early enough in their life).The church says that you'll be rewarded in the end.  Yeah, the rear end, I'm sure.  Get out your wallets, people!I really doubt that I will be buying ""Unsolved Mysteries: Miracles, Volume Two"".  The ""UFO"" Collection can seem to be a little too far fetched too, even the ""Ghosts"" episodes, but they do contribute to what is called an unsolved mystery.  I'd definitely like to see more volumes of other themes made available.",Unsolved Mysteries: Miracles
110309,"There's really not that much that needs to be said. The other most famous adaptation of this book, Disney's Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, is poorly animated, makes tons of pointless changes, and just doesn't tell a very good story.Rankin-Bass's Wind in the Willows, on the other hand, has good songs, more visual appeal, and better voice acting, and it's much more faithful to the book. The characters really feel like themselves; they capture Mole's innocence, Badger's intransigence, Ratty's affability and Toad's mania beautifully, and all of the characters come across as people you'd like to spend time with.It's a real shame this film hasn't been restored and released on DVD, as it's one of my favorite book-to-film adaptations.",N/A
190014,"This New Zealand film is directed with wild abandon by Peter Jackson, who would find fame and fortune with a later and better effort, the critically acclaimed ""Heavenly Creatures"", and with the spectalular, award winning, ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Of course, even the best directors have to start somewhere. This is a sort of campy, darkly comedic, horror film that suffers from an excess of gore that is extreme and over the top. Notwithstanding this, it has moments of actual promise that eventually simply succumb to the director's excesses.The story is a simple one and takes place in the nineteen fifties. In Sumatra,  there is a highly unusual creature called a Rat Monkey that looks exactly as it is named. When one is spirited out of the country, despite  the outrage of the local natives, it is the beginning of the end. Unbeknownst to its handlers, a Rat Monkey bite transmits a virus that makes a zombie out of  the bitten entity. Upon arrival in New Zealand, the Rat Monkey is placed in the local zoo.Meanwhile, a local mama's boy, Lionel (Timothy Balme), meets the luscious Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Penalver), whose ancient crone of a grandmother (Davina Whitehouse) had recently  predicted that Paquita would be meeting  the love of her life. The only problem is that in the Tarot cards her grandmother read, it appears that Paquita's erstwhile lover is surrounded by death.Paquita, sure that Lionel is the one, does everything possible to ensure that Lionel takes her on a date. Unfortunately, Lionel lives in a mansion with his rich, domineering Mum (Elizabeth Moody). So, when Paquita and Lionel go to the zoo on their first date, dear old Mum arranges to catch up with them at the zoo, only to find herself bitten by the Rat Monkey. Soon after, Mum  finds herself a member of undead.Lionel calls for Nurse McTavish (Brenda Kendall) to come and tend to Mum, as to him she appears to have fallen strangely ill.  After a run in with Mum's teeth, Nurse McTavish finds herself among the undead, as well. Initially, Lionel has the situation under control, keep the bodies of the undead tranquilized and tied up in the basement.When, however, his mother is finally declared officially dead and a funeral is arranged , his sleazy , lecherous Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) comes out of the woodwork, looking for a share of Lionel's inheritance. When he goes to the mansion in which Lionel lives, he discovers the undead in the basement. So, he blackmails Lionel. Uncle  Les promises not to notify the police that Lionel has seemingly dead bodies in the basement. In return, Lionel  promises to turn over his mother's mansion and fortune over to Les.Unfortunately, Les  then throws a big party at the mansion, while the undead are in the basement. When the undead get out, all hell breaks loose, as they start biting and eating  everyone, creating hordes of new undead, which Lionel and Paquita must battle in order to survive.There are some very funny moments in this campy, offbeat film. The problem is the gore is so over the top that it becomes tiresome. It is certainly not scary. There are some excellent performances by the cast. Elizabeth Moody is wonderful as Mum, and Ian Watkins is quite funny as  Lionel's Uncle Les.  Diana Penalver is excellent in the role of the winsome Paquita, and the rest of the supporting cast is more than adequate for the roles in this film, which consist mostly of letting oneself be torn asunder by the undead.This is a totally over the top film that has the makings of becoming a cult classic. It is worth a rental for those for whom too much gore is simply not enough.",Dead Alive

Why does Hollywood repeatedly gear Science Fiction films to the mentality of teenage boys? Memo to Hollywood: THERE'S A MARKET FOR GROWN-UPS, even for Sci-Fi!!! Will someone please fill this nitch! PLEASE! I'm not asking for perfection, or genius. Just an ending without any ridiculous predictability, which, in turn, is devoid of any meaning, or real satisfaction. A film where more than half the time is NOT focused on killing and body counts. No more Wonder Women, (or men) who barely get scratched in mortal combat, or don't even bother to break into a sweat! In other words, out with the old LOWEST CAMP DENOMINATOR, and in with some new GROWN-UP STORY TELLING!The world of Aeon Flux is where men are either fools; conservative mass murderers; or fall like cardboard, and die like butter. Women, on the other hand, are tough as steal; have muscles; sleep with men and then knock them out, (ouch!); kill with such perfection, and ease, I thought they must be cyborgs; and single-handedly change the course of history!Here's a future where no one bothers to take a look on the other side of a big wall in 400-years! Human cloning and the quest for immortality are the root of all evil! Where killing pregnent women is done in order to keep the status quo, that is, mostly men in charge!Oh, yes the special-effect-eye-candy is magnificent! Too bad the storyline is two dimentional. I'll trade a low budget, low eye-candy film with a good story over this tedious trash, any day!Do us all a big favor! Don't encourage Hollywood to continuely make nonsense like Aeon Flux!

337308,"Although this film was released on home video in the U.S. in 1984 as ""Taro the Dragon Boy"" (five years after it appeared in Japanese theaters in 1979), not many people seem to remember it, which is a shame, as it is one of the best anime films I've ever seen. I rented the English-dubbed version, helmed by the legendary Peter Fernandez (also worked on the English dubs of ""Speed Racer"" and ""Superbook""), on video from my video store on several occasions as a child, and was awestruck. Taro is a remarkable young man - he possesses immense strength and an enormous appetite, but he also has a heart of gold, and the object of his quest is to find his mother, Katsu, who was changed into a dragon many years ago. (One scene which made a big impression on me is the scene in which Taro and the villagers are feasting after Taro defeated a demon who was threatening the village, and Taro - who has an appetite to rival Garfield's - can't enjoy the celebration because he keeps thinking of the folks back in his home village who have nothing to eat. That shows what a pure, good heart he has.) This film holds up very well even to this day. The animation is remarkably fluid given that the film is now over a quarter-century old, and the music is also very well-done. There are even vocal songs, which were dubbed into English for the U.S. release along with the dialogue, and they're also pretty good, even in English; the dialogue is also well-written and well-dubbed. The ending will absolutely have you in tears. If you can find a used copy of this film on VHS, by all means pick it up. It's a real classic. (Incidentally, despite the Japanese title, ""Tatsu no ko Taro,"" this animation was NOT produced by Tatsunoko Production, but by Toei Animation, which later became internationally famous for ""Dragonball,"" ""Sailor Moon,"" and ""One Piece."")",N/A

768326,"""The Eye""is one of those films whose whole is not equal to the sum of its parts. Sometimes silly, oftentimes dull, other times, brilliant ""The Eye"" will surprise you every so often with a scene that is absolute magic.Mun (Angelica Lee) has been blind her whole life, and by way of a corneal transplant she regains her sight.Then her real problems begin. Because now she literally sees dead people...more specifically ghosts who, through a variety of reasons are unsettled in the afterlife or who have simply not been able to make that final crossover into death.As you can imagine this is a bit discomforting for Mun. Is she insane? And why is that young lad with the cap continually accosting her outside of her apartment asking for his report card? She seeks help from a psychologist Wah (Laurence Chou) who, breaking every Hippocratic oath in the book, falls for her and though he is skeptical about her visions, helps Mun to find the cornea donor's family in Bangkok and hopefully uncover the evidence there to prove to her that she has not gone insane in the process of re-gaining her sight.The scenes in Thailand are gorgeous and directors Pang and Chun have taken advantage of the natural beauty of Bangkok and created a creepy, doomed, mysterious mise en scene that adds to the suspenseful nature of Mun's and Wah's task.""The Eye"" is pretty much redeemed by the scenes and action in Thailand and the directors keen and all-seeing eyes, like Hitchcock's have a knack for focusing on what is really scary: the everyday stuff of life...in this case the fat dripping off a bloody roasting chicken, a caf&eacute; cook loudly and rapidly chopping up some pork or a bad light bulb twinkling in a darkly lit hallway.

666998,"Amores Perros is a Mexican film by 21 Grams director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu that involves three interlocking stories of love, violence, loss, and dogs. Yes, dogs.The first segment of three in the 150-minute movie involves a young man named Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who puts his rottweiler Cofi into dog fights, in which Cofi literally kills all his competition, and makes some nice coin along the way, which he hopes will convince his troubled brother Ramiro's mistreated young wife Susana (Vanessa Bauche), pregnant with Ramiro's second child, to come away with him. The segment begins and ends with the climactic car crash that links the three stories.Segment two focuses on up-and-coming model/actress Valeria (Goya Toledo) and her beau, Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero), a magazine publisher who has left his wife and two daughters to be with her. In the new apartment they share, Valeria's dog Richie accidentally ends up underneath the floorboards, and the couple are at a loss for ideas on how to get him out, especially since they can't even see him and don't know if he's scared, trapped, or lost under there. This, coupled with Valeria's deteriorating health and uncertainty about her professional future, allows complications to arise in the relationship.In the final segment, a seemingly down-on-his-luck guerilla-turned-hitman (Emilio Echevarria) is hired to take out a yuppie's partner for reasons not apparently clear. The hitman has also recently rescued a dying dog and attempting to nurse it back to health, adding him to the already bountiful stable of pooches that follow him around as he pushes his cart around town. The hitman has unfinished business from his past that he is also dealing with - and an opportunity arises for him to set things right and carry out his own designs on the hit for which he has been commissioned.It is near impossible not to get completely absorbed in this film. The characters are so well drawn out, and each given hints of ambiguity that it is so easy to relate to every one of them - because we can immediately recognize them as humans, not just people in movies. Innaritu's documentary style of filmmaking - nearly every shot done with a handheld camera - makes us feel as if we're spying on real life.As far as the involvement of dogs: it's a stroke of genius. Pay attention to the scene near the end when two characters, each carrying a massive amount of enmity toward the other, are unleashed on one another. Besides the species, how is this different from a dog fight? Parallels are drawn throughout the film between dogs and humans; we can be at times loyal, scared, hurt, and vicious. Unlike most movies, Amores Perros does not seek easy answers to life's hardest questions.",Amores Perros

638791,"First of all, I am a total devotee of the Hitchiker novels in particular and all things Douglas Adams in general. I was crushed by his premature death because one of the truly original thinkers and commentators on the inherent bizarreness of the universe was gone. I had very deep reservations about whether the novels could be brought to the screen by Adams -- let along anyone else. However, Adams had apparently completed substantial parts of the screenplay at the time of his death. As astute as he was, he realized that he could not transport his book plots, item by item to the film genre.What amazed me, seeing this DVD, was the thoughtful way the movie presents the ""feel"" of the novels without eroneously trying to remain slavishly faithful to them. There are favorite parts that anyone who has read the books will miss, but if what you love is Adams wonderfully goofy humor, this is a wonderful movie. The director, the talented enselble cast, and the whimsical sets all recreate the true ""essence"" of the Adams novels.If you enjoyed the books and are willing to endure the changes due to the difference in the medium of film and book, then you will really enjoy this great movie. If you have never read the book, and want to see what all the fuss is about over Douglas Adam's books, this is a great way to see whether you ""get it"".You will see other reviews that do a terrific job of describing each of the characters and their parts in the plot. The casting was strong, the direction was excellent, and the CGI was effective but not overwhelming.

713327,"A short R-rated Japanese ""horror"" film about a deranged family that videotapes their crimes by director Takashi Miike.  The movie stars Kenichi Endo, Shungiku Uchida, Kazushi Watanabe, and Shoko Nakahara.  The film contains nudity (both male and female; though a particular lower region is blurry on the front for both the men and women; going by the comic books, the blurring/censoring might be required by law in Japan - though in the movie, that blurring does not always occur).DVD features: Contains the movie (in Japanese with English subtitles) plus some extras.  The special features include: a director's biography (very detailed); liner notes (very detailed); and trailers (four trailers: Samurai Fiction; Freeze Me; Visitor Q; and Fudoh).The movie opens with what looks like a prostitute and a ""John"" in a hotel room (appearances can be deceiving).  Both have cameras, and the jerky camera work appears to represent what the two cameras see, sometimes at an extreme close-up view (though the woman is the one most often in view).  Then the camera becomes mostly stationary and the ""action"" unfolds (though the action is somewhat blurry - the action is blurry, and a particular area of the male form is deliberately blurred; and the stationary position changes).  The movie starts out seeming to be just a somewhat boring interaction in a hotel room.And then it turns strange.  A man (call him father), the same man from the first scene, is hit over the head.  Then a new scene, set in a disturbing home where the son dominates the mother, and what's this?  Father has brought his ""friend"" that hit him on the head over to his apartment to meet his wife and son.  It would appear that father is a journalist that had been trying to make a little documentary about how the youth are fairing in Japan, but was attacked.  The attack was video-taped and shown on the air (not the earlier attack mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph).  The man became disgraced and now is ""on-break.""  Well, his new idea is to film his own family, and document bullying.  The bullied end up bullying others.I suppose it is interesting just trying to figure out what is going on, or what the movie is truly supposed to be about.  Though it isn't that hard to figure out after a while (but, do you are you correct?).  With this type of strange movie, it is difficult to determine how much to reveal, so I'll need to leave the review vague.  I will say that the people involved appear insane, and there appears to be a slight similarity to the film ""15 Seconds"" in that both include criminals video-taping their acts, though they are very different movies.The sick and disturbing movie contains violence (both of the bullying nature and of the sexual nature - women getting attacked), torture, whipping, drug use, death, dismemberment, necrophilia (and the dangers of said acts), and incest.  A strange disturbing little movie (though it can be strangely funny at least one time).  Hard to rate this type of movie, or know which category to place it.  Good music at least.  Due to the need to use the subtitles, and the strange nature of the film, it is hard to critic the acting, nor can proper crediting be given (most of the credits appear to be in Japanese; a list of the actors is given in English, but not matched up with any particular part).

411616,"Someday in the near future, perhaps, some enterprising young scholar will write a lengthy dissertation on Burt Reynolds's storied cinematic career. I know I would like to know how an actor of such populist appeal in the 1970s could plunge into the depths of ignominy by the 1980s and 1990s. Of course Burt is in the midst of a renaissance since his turn in ""Boogie Nights"" a few years back, reemerging as a sort of world weary Hollywood elder statesman of the type William Holden used to be a couple of decades ago. My ponderings about the ups and downs of Reynolds's career inspired me to check out a couple of his earliest films recently, and I started with the 1973 backwoods romp ""White Lightening."" Why not? I've already watched ""The Longest Yard"" so many times that I could probably reproduce the entire script from memory. And as for ""Deliverance,"" well, that picture is more of an ensemble effort than a vehicle for Reynolds. No, ""White Lightening"" is a good place to start because it develops in embryonic form the type of character Burt would cultivate to fullest effect in ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" his most successful film and probably the apogee of his career.""White Lightening"" introduces us to Bobby ""Gator"" McKlusky (Reynolds), a renowned bootlegger currently serving his second sentence for smuggling hooch. Gator is doing his time in the stir the easy way, working in the shop fixing up cars and generally hamming it up with his fellow inmates and the prison staff. Everyone likes Gator and Gator tends to like everyone around him. Then tragedy strikes when McKlusky's sister shows up to tell him that their brother wound up dead in a swamp. Since their brother was a straight arrow and a college student, both are mystified as to why he would fall victim to foul play. When Gator discovers that a corrupt sheriff by the name of J.C. Connors (Ned Beatty) might have something to do with the murder, he walks out of prison with the goal of making things right. The authorities track him down before he gets very far, but his escape and the reasons for it bring in some federal agents and a dangerous offer. If Gator will go undercover and gather evidence against Connors's various illegal schemes, the feds will let McKlusky walk away from the rest of his sentence. Of course, Gator agrees to the proposal because he thinks it will allow him to seek personal revenge against Connors.The feds tell Gator to go see one Dude Watson (Matt Clark), a parolee with a long list of liquor violations, as an in to Connors's action. Watson wants no part of Gator, however, but eventually goes along with the plan when he realizes he has no choice. It is Watson who introduces McKlusky to moonshine runner Roy Boone (Bo Hopkins), and before too long Gator is in like gold with this man and his girlfriend Lou (Jennifer Billingsley). Boone helps his new pal get work with big time liquor manufacturer Big Bear (R.G. Armstrong), a very dangerous individual who trusts no one for very long. But he comes to trust Gator, grudgingly, until a series of incidents reveal exactly whom McKlusky is really working for. Connors resorted to a little torture to divulge this piece of information, which results in the abduction of Gator and Lou by Big Bear's sweaty associates. Faced with certain death, McKlusky manages to escape (of course) and wreak his own brand of down home vengeance on the crooked cop. And he does it without the help of the feds or the state authorities. I'm not giving anything away when I say that the climatic scene involves a big car chase. You knew there would be a car chase, right? If not, you don't belong here!I liked ""White Lightening"" even though the pace of the film tends to drag. Reynolds does a pretty nice job in his role, and even gets a few opportunities to show some range with in his scenes with Lou as well as in a scene where he talks about the pain of losing his brother. Ned Beatty plays the corrupt southern cop with great aplomb, letting us know his brutal nature without taking the character over the top. What really works in the film is the great atmosphere. It's obvious director Joseph Sargent shot the majority of the film in the Deep South. The dismal swamp seen in the opening credits, the gravel back roads hemmed in by vegetation, the claustrophobically small town, and the ramshackle buildings out in the boonies fairly screams ""THIS MOVIE WAS FILMED IN THE SOUTH AND WE'RE DARN PROUD OF IT!"" The set pieces and locations are so good you can practically feel the humidity and heat wafting out of your DVD player. And that's a good thing. It gives the film a realism lacking in other movies in this particular genre. Throw in the car chases, a few fistfights, and some southern humor and you've got all the fixings for a fun way to spend a couple of hours.Unfortunately, the DVD version of ""White Lightening"" leaves a lot to be desired. The picture transfer is fullscreen, not widescreen, and the quality looks below average. How so? Scenes shot in the dark look really dark, so dark it's hard to see what's going on. Moreover, the only extra included on the disc is a trailer. While I don't always listen to (or appreciate) commentary tracks on DVDs, I would like to hear Burt Reynolds's comments on this movie. I'm somewhat of a completist when it comes to this actor's films, which in this instance means I want a commentary track. If you haven't seen it yet, give ""White Lightening"" a shot; it's far superior to the rather lackluster sequel ""Gator"" made several years later.",White Lightning VHS

A lot of stories about those times have been lost, and now thanks to Martin Scorsese's film, we now have a glimpse.Leonardo DiCaprio, according to my research, has nailed the realization of Howard Hughes. What a terrific performance! Best of the year in my opinion. No one in my mind could have pulled it off as well. I was a teenager when Titanic came out, and just like most guys, I hated Leo. Number one reason? You guessed it, probably because you experienced it on one end of the stick or the other: Jealousy. Well, now that I have grown up and knocked the green out of my eyes I can see what an incredible actor he is. Most people fall back on ""Whats eating Gilbert Grape"" as his best performance. Well, yes, that was great, but not the best...anymore. (Check out ""Gangs of New York"" as well. The price of the 2 disc dvd has fallen dramatically, it has awesome sound and video qualities.)Like I mentioned earlier, I have lived with the works or Katie Hepburn for a lifetime, so you can trust me when I say this: Cate Blanchett is Phe-nom-e-nal! The day someone gives a better performance, atleast personality wise, I will be a shocked individual. Even though some of the accounts in this film were very intimate, I don't think she would be upset. She was very candid in speaking her mind and letting people know what she thought. Then there's Mr Tracy...Aviator is a great movie, tragic and epic. One day this film will be recognized, maybe the same way as Raging Bull, Wizard of Oz, or It's a Wonderful Life, as a great film that will grow over time. ~saos~",N/A
289086,"""What about this dame,"" says policeman Gus Forbes (Don Beddoe) to his partner, Detective Sergeant Walter Brown (Charles McGraw), who has already tagged her type without ever meeting her. The dame's a gun moll widow of a gangster. They're in a taxi on their way to pick her up, escort her to the Chicago train station and protect her from mob killers on the train until they reach Los Angeles. She's going to testify before a grand jury and blow the lid off the mob.""A dish,"" Brown says.""What kind of a dish?""""She's a 60-cent special. Cheap, flashy, and strictly poison under the gravy.""""Amazing,"" his partner says. ""And how do you know all this?""""Well, she was married to a hoodlum, wasn't she?"" Brown says. ""What kind of a dame would marry a hood?""The dame they're going to protect, Mrs. Frankie Neall (Marie Windsor), is selfish, not quite a slut, and deeply aware she may not make it to Los Angeles alive. She and Brown instantly dislike each other. Before they can even get out the door of her apartment, the hoods make a play for her but succeed only in killing Forbes. The killers don't see what she looks like, but they see Brown before they run. Brown gets her to the train and into their compartment. For the next day and a half, members of the mob try to bribe him and find and kill her. Brown knows who a couple of the killers are, but what about the woman who spills a drink on him? Or the fat man? Or the smoothie who shows up wearing a white carnation, gloves and a homburg? What about the auto that's racing along side the train to reach the next station when the train stops for a few minutes? Brown is alone, feeling guilty over the death of his partner, protecting a woman he detests, knowing that killers are after them. ""My partner's dead and it's my fault,"" he snarls at her. ""He's dead and you're alive. Some exchange.""This is one of the grade B great noirs from the tail end of Hollywood's noir period. The story line moves as fast and relentlessly forward as the train the plot takes place in. The movie isn't long and not a moment is wasted on exposition or character background. The whole set up for the plot is covered in a few lines of dialogue and a glimpse of a newspaper headline. There's no score, just the sounds of the wheels on the track, doors opening and closing, a train whistle. Almost all the movie is shot on the train, and is confined to the compartments, the club car, the dining car, the tight hallways. There's no place to get away, and the process of elimination will sooner or later bring the hoods to the compartment where Brown has hidden Mrs. Neall. False leads and misdirection keep you on your toes. The photography is exceptional, from the death of Forbes in a shadowy stairway to the reflection of action on the windows of the train.Charles McGraw, a tough looking actor, plays Brown, and Brown is a tough cop. McGraw has a gravelly voice and a face that looks like it's taken a few punches. Marie Windsor matches him in the no illusions department. Windsor, with her sullen eyes, almost always played bad girls. The two of them snarl at each other, slam doors in each other's face and get off some great lines of pulp dialogue. The tension between the two of them provides a lot of the film's energy. The other actors bring dimension to what could have been stock threats.The one weakness is the death of a major character, who, once dead, simply disappears without thought or regret. We've become invested in the character and it's a little unsettling to have the person dealt with so emotionlessly.This is a fast-paced noir with some great, pulp-noir dialogue by screenwriter Earl Felton, a lot of tension on the train and enough suspicious developments to keep you guessing. If you've seen the 1990 remake, Narrow Margin, be prepared for some surprises. The DVD picture looks great. There are no extras except a commentary track by William Friedkin and an old, edited audio interview with Richard Fleischer.",N/A
842512,"It `s not easy to be engaged immediately with this picture, at least I have to recognize it. There are two definite lines that support the script.The first is dramatic: a schizophrenic girl - Lisa - abandons the Psychiatric Institute in search of more affection and less professional treatment: her mother is a flat mind who can not understand anything about. She will find shelter in her friend: a hairdresser who simultaneously makes appearances in night clubs as travesty, playing fantastic imitations of Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow and Bette Davis with elegance far from vulgarity and common places.In this state of things, apparently Lisa seems to be not making the best choice, but the time goes by and finally in a mutual cathartic explosion, she will find affection, understanding and human comfort with her.The picture was made with a clear resources economy, you can note it through the troubled photography and editions adjustments, but the whole result, being in the appropriate anima, can be rewarding for you.I guess this film must have been a reference cult movie in many underground midnight circuits in the middle seventies.",N/A
963175,"Danny (Jonah Bobo), seven years old, and Walter (Josh Hutcherson), ten, are left in the care of their older sister, Lisa (Kirsten Stewart). Dad (Tim Robbins) asks her to keep an eye on them as he runs to the office to pick up something for an upcoming meeting.  Being the teenager she is, she promptly goes back to sleep. Walter wants to watch baseball on TV, avoiding his younger brother. When Danny proves to be too much of a pest, Walter chases him throughout the house. He finds Danny hiding in the old dumb waiter and lowers him into the basement. Danny finds his way to the stairs and notices an old board game hiding between the wooden steps. ""Zathura, a Space Adventure for Two Players"". Danny excitedly shows the game to Walter who ignores him. Danny opens the box and turns the key on the board, causing a button to pop out. He presses the button. His spaceship is moved mechanically across the board. A card pops out. It reads ""Meteor Shower. Take Evasive Action."" Danny can't read the card and shows Walter. Walter looks at the card and explains what it means just as meteors begin to destroy the living room. They soon realize that their house is floating in outer space. The only way home? To complete the game.""Zathura"", directed by Jon Favreau (""Elf"", ""Made"", ""Swingers""), is based on a Chris Van Allsburg book, the same children's book author behind ""Jumanji"" and ""The Polar Express"".A well-crafted film suitable for the whole family, ""Zathura"" is a delight.The story is involving and interesting and effectively brings us into the lives of these children. As Danny and Walter run around the house, getting on each others nerves, they seem entirely realistic; two young boys, stuck inside, bored, on a Saturday afternoon. What else would they do except annoy each other, get into mischief and make various attempts to play together? As soon as they find the game, the story really kicks into gear. They realize that they have to play the game through to the end, to get their house back to its small lot in Pasadena and for everything to return to normal. As they play the game, they realize that they have to work together to overcome the challenges of Zathura.""Jumanji"" had a similar premise, but ""Zathura"" is a very different film. The first film seemed overflowing with characters and animals. ""Zathura"" takes a different approach, telling the story of the two brothers and a couple of visitors who help out through the course of the story. Because of this, ""Zathura"" seems more manageable, more intimate. The first film had Robin Williams' antics, but this new film seems better, more enjoyable, more like a real adventure.Each card popping out of the machine signals the beginning of a new part of the adventure, a new challenge. Some of these put the two boys in dangerous situations that only strengthen the bond between them, others provide some comic relief. An early card reads ""Player enters cryogenic sleep chamber. For next five turns."" Lisa (Stewart), still not realizing that the house is floating through space walks into her bathroom, concerned that she will be late for her date, and instantly freezes solid. The two boys don't know what to do, except to keep her safe until that action has expired. Another card reads ""Rescue Abandoned Astronaut"". At that very moment, an astronaut (Dax Shepard, TV's ""Punked"") flies by the front door. After they rescue him, he proves particularly useful during the remaining challenges.When you were a kid, you most likely played games or with toys, imagining they were real and you were actually interacting with them. ""Zathura"" brilliantly captures this feeling, taking it to a new level. Two little boys who were playing a real board game would probably interact in the same way. If one of the players started imagining something a little scary, the other would either encourage him to keep going, to become stronger, or help him through the challenge. The two brothers do this throughout. As various parts of the house are demolished by a robot, heat seeking aliens, and meteors, they scramble to keep the board game, their ticket home, intact.Director Jon Favreau does a great job at the helm. From the beautiful house, a million plus dollar Arts and Crafts home that dad (Robbins) says he is fixing up, to the look and feel of the board game, Favreau has a definite and unique style. Much like in ""Elf"", Favreau likes everything to seem a little retro. In ""Zathura"", the board game graphics and design appear to have been plucked out of the Fifties. A robot, looking more like something from ""Forbidden Planet"" than ""Star Wars Episode III"", makes an appearance. It actually looks like some of the special effects were created the old fashioned way, with models and miniature, rather than excessive CGI, lending the film a charm many parents should appreciate.Favreau also does a nice job with the actors. The two brothers are great. Funny and entirely believable, they could live in any house on your street. Kirsten Stewart is also very funny as Lisa, the typical teenage girl. And Dax Stewart does a nice job as the slightly charismatic astronaut.""Zathura"" is that rare live action film good for the entire family. Kids will love it and adults will enjoy watching it. A couple of the scenes are probably too scary for some of the youngest children. Children Danny's age, under 7, will probably find the film too scary. But everyone else should have a great time playing ""Zathura"".",Zathura
271131,"I thought this was a very good video, but if you are interested in the long Yang form, this is the more modernized, wu shu version of it rather than the original Yang Chen Fu version, according to my instructor.The video includes some tai chi warm-up excercises, and two presentations of the entire form. The first shows the moves step by step with the names and numbers of the move, with slight pauses in between. The second shows the entire form from beginning to end as one continuous, smooth performance.One difference between this and the original Yang Cheng Fu form is the somewhat larger moves, or ""large frame"" aspect to the form. It follows almost the same sequence, though, except for some changes in several places in the form, especially at the beginning of the form, and in the middle of the second section, in the movements just before and after double wind to ears. Some of the moves are done a little differently, too, such as snake darts out tongue, wave hands like clouds, etc.Also, Dunn does not keep the qua open (keeping the armpits open by one fist distance, or the arms away from the side of the body, which aids with balance through the waist and to the legs) which is an important internal principle. But overall Dunn has very nice, smooth, flowing form, exceptional balance (the ability to pause and hold the kicks), and I enjoyed his performance.Overall I thought this was a well done video and found it useful in comparing what I do with some of the other Yang versions out there. I also have his short Yang form video and thought that was similarly well done.",N/A
258439,"Made in 1983 The Day After gives the viewer an honest look at the aftermath of a nuclear exchange back in the cold war days when the US and USSR had hundreds of ICBM's aimed at each other. A made-for-TV-movie the movie lacks the big budget effects, and more than likely blew most of its money on hiring Jason Robards, but still manages to give the viewewr the creeps when the bombs do hit. There's poor acting abound and too many subplots aren't fleshed out enough for the two hours. This should have been a mini-series of about 6-8 hours to get a full effect of the disaster. Nontheless a worthy anti-war movie that shoots from the heart and not from some Hollywood suit's demographics chart.",N/A
863719,"In the beginning there was ""Up in Smoke"" with Cheech and Chong. If that was not the original stoner comedy it is at least the most pertinent reference point for considering ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,"" because as a society we have clearly moved from a stoner comedy in 1978 starring a Hispanic-American and an Asian-American to a stoner comedy in 2004 starring a pair of Asian-Americans. Not only that, but the two young Asian-Americans are a Korean-American and an Indian-American, and not the Chinese-Americans and Japanese-Americans that usually pop up in American movies (or the Chinese and Japanese that pop up in Chinese and Japanese movies, respectively).The ethnicity of the two main characters, Harold Lee (John Cho), an investment banker, and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn), who is avoiding going to medical school, matters because while these pair are stoners, they are the two smartest stoners in the history of American cinema. Yes, I know, the bar is set pretty low in the first place in that regard, but these guys are really smart. They are both college graduates, Harold has a real job in the real world involving making real money and Kumar has perfect MCAT scores, which explains why he can perform surgery is the situation requires it. Of course the first-time writing team of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are not Asian-American, so I cannot go so far as to argue there is a concerted political statement being made here, but in terms of playing with an ethnic stereotype this works pretty well. Besides, any excuse to make the lead characters in a movie like this something more than dope smoking idiots is always going to be a good thing.This film is in the great tradition of ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" which is to say that ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" is a quest film. The title characters are already high when a White Castle commercial comes on and suddenly the most important thing in the world is getting a bag of the mini-burgers to scarf down. However, this requires getting in a car and driving to the closest White Castle, which is not in the same town. In fact, exactly where the closest White Castle is becomes a major problem in the film, which makes sense because otherwise it ends up being about an hour shorter. In between getting into Harold's car and finding the Promised Land there are a gang of skateboarders, an entire department of racist cops, a tow truck driver with serious genetic problems, and, best of all, Neil Patrick Harris (Neil Patrick Harris).I can appreciate Harold and Kumar's situation in terms of trying to find a White Castle because I thought we had one in our town and we did, but it has since closed. So my plan to have the kids pick up White Castles to eat while watching the film, admittedly not the most original idea in the world for this one, was thwarted. But there was talk about driving 70 miles to where we know there is a White Castle and if it was not for the fact that the movie would have been over by the time whoever made the trip came back with cold burgers we might have considered it. So someone was sent out for tacos instead, which made no sense for watching a movie starring a pair of Asian-Americans, so we ate the tacos without watching the movie (No, when I watched the movie I did not eat Oriental food either, so the whole logic here fell apart completely).Director Danny Leiner did ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and the parallels between the two become really obvious once Harold's car gets stolen by the actor who played Doogie Howswer (playing himself). But this movie really is twice as good. Is it because Leiner learned from his mistakes the first time around? Is it because writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are twice as good as Philip Stark (who at least had the ""Pink Eye"" episode of ""South Park"" on his resume)? Is it because John Cho and Kal Penn are twice the actors Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott happen to be?Now, that last one I am pretty sure I can quantify, because Cho and Penn do a great job of keeping these characters real and quite different from what we usually find in such films, but I keep coming back to the ethnicity of the two stars, although the film does not go overboard on the Asian stereotypes (there is a scene where Harold has to deal with a group of other Korean-Americans that could be right out of ""Gilmore Girls""). Would this film be as funny if the two leads were something other than Asian-American? It really matters that these two guys are smart and the film takes advantage of the stereotype that Asian-Americans are smart to make that point. Lots of stoners have been obsessed with the quest for weed and a bad case of the munchies, but Kumar is smarter than all of them put together, which makes his dream world involving a giant bag of pot that much funnier. Then there is Harold and his quest to at least speak to Maria (Paula Garces), the beautiful girl he keeps meeting in the elevator in his apartment building.The other way in which ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" goes against type in the stoner movie genre is that there is actually a sense of personal growth for the boys after their experience. In this case the film is much more reminiscent of ""The Lord of the Rings"" than ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" You do not expect stoners to grow up at the end of their quest (you expect them to spend all their reward money getting Van Halen to play at their birthday party), which just gets us back to the ethnicity of Harold and Kumar. It is rather difficult to walk that kind of a tightrope in a comedy (see ""White Chicks""), but this film manages to do it. It will also absolutely cure you of ever wanting to sneak into the girl's bathroom in a college dorm.",N/A
431888,"As big dumb action films go, it hardly gets bigger and dumber than this.  Yet ""Con Air"" is bursting at the seams with acting talent and a laugh-out-loud script so chock full of classic action film one-liners it makes this movie one of the most rapturous popcorn-munching guilty pleasures since ""Point Break"".  This is a movie that so gleefully revels in its shallowness and perfectly tuned to its adrenaline-craving audience, it can barely afford five minutes to spend on all of the necessary plot setup, dispensing of it easily before the title graphics even appear.  In that five minutes, we learn that Army Ranger Cameron Poe (a musclebound Nicholas Cage) has returned from a tour of duty to visit his lovely wife.  No sooner does he step off the plane and finish a line dance, then he gets into some trouble with some wound-up locals.  They fight, one pulls a knife, and Poe ends up killing him in self defense.  Whoops.  Well, the yokels make off with the knife and Poe gets railroaded into Arkansas federal prison, where he spends his days weaving in and out of Michael Bey-style quick edits, working furiously on his pecs and voice-over narrating sensitive letters to his yet unseen daughter in a ridiculously mannered southern drawl that sounds like Foghorn Leghorn on a morphine trip. After 8 years of prison workouts and bad hair days, Poe is finally on his way home to meet his daughter - that is, until his prison transfer plane is hijacked by the forces of evil.  And mayhem and madness ensues as all laws of sensible plot development are thrown out the window and action movie physics take over.The ensemble all-star villains cast includes John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi as a Jeffrey Dahmer type, plus sturdy supporting roles for Dave Chappelle and Danny Trejo.  John Cusack and Colm Meaney have a grand time on the ground playing good cop/bad cop as they try to track the runaway jet, while Rachel Ticotin and Mykelti Williamson provide visual confirmation of Poe's conscience as well as distracting semi-perils that our hero must solve.  Director Simon West keeps the action flowing, synched perfectly to Trevor Rabin's noisy industrial-strength action film soundtrack, as Con Air careens from one implausibly over-the-top set piece to another.  This is the kind of movie that could *only* end up crashing a C-130 into the Las Vegas strip.  Are we surprised when the perfectly operational police bike crashes into the back of the firetruck and explodes instantly?  Or seeing an angry Poe taking a gunshot to the arm and not even flinch?  Or how about Malkovich somehow being able to surreptitiously construct an incindiary device in a maximum-security lockdown?  (Of course, i'd say the effete Malkovich has a better chance of the latter, as opposed to giving an freakishly amped-up Cage a good match in a fist fight on a runaway firetruck.)It always amuses me when sensible people - would-be critic and audient alike - log on to try to throw the believability gauntlet at a hilariously grand spectacle like this.  Is it seriously worth wasting your time expressing indignance about your cinematic sensibilities being ruffled by a Simpson/Bruckheimer production?  Were you expecting Simon West to squeeze out a mini-""Citizen Kane"" before he got to work on ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider""?  ADMIT that you have been entertained.  And put the bunny down.",N/A

367055,"Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is certainly quite imaginitive, but it is not a horror film classic by any means whatsoever.  As I watched, I thought to myself that this movie is very radical and way out of the ordinary and that is probably why people like it so much.  Frankly, I did not find the cenobytes to be that scary (interesting, yes, but not scary) or Frank in his bloody flesh form.The movie kept my interest because I wanted to see how it would end, so for that part, I'll give it a 2.5 STAR rating, but as an overall horror flick, I wasn't that impressed.  That being said, it was suspenseful and the story is somewhat interesting and entertaining to a certain degree.  The acting is actually pretty good and the directing is average, but the storyline isn't that compelling as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.The movie starts out with a man named Frank, who is quite evil (he comes off as more evil than the Cenobytes to me) and very sensual who buys a puzzle box that supposedly contains the secret pleasures and pain of Hell which are obviously closely related.  I sincerely doubt there is any pleasure in Hell, but if you are evil maybe you can get some sick form of pleasure from it.  Anyway, the Cenobytes are released from the box by Frank.  The Cenobytes introduce Frank to incredible torture and pain that is of a supernatural nature.  The leader of the Cenobytes named ""Pinhead"" orchestrates such torture upon Frank and anyone else who dares to fiddle with that box.  I should say that I found all of the Cenobytes to be interesting and very imaginative.  My favorite one was the whose teeth were always chattering.  I thought he was funny.However, Frank discovers that he can actually regain human form if he is given enough blood and flesh from the living.  His former adulteress procures men that she kills in order to provide this blood to Frank and slowly but surely he regains this human form.  However, the daughter of the adulteress's husband informs the Cenobytes that Frank is escaping their clutches and she leads Frank back to them so that they can take him back to Hell where he belongs.  The young lady discovers that the Cenobytes want her as well, but she is able to manipulate the box to thwart any of their evil advances.The ending of this movie is pretty lame in my opinion as some demon flies off with the box.  While Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is quite imaginitive and entertaining to some degree, it is also plenty gross and disgusting as the movie indulges itself with inordinate amounts of gore which the film obviously relies very heavily upon in order to attain a horror-like quality.  To me, this is not scary, but it is gross.  I do like blood and gore when it is used correctly to accentuate the horror, but I believe that blood and gore are a tool which should be incidental to the story and atmosphere of the movie.  With ""Hellraiser"", the blood and gore overshadows the story to some degree.  I understand that a certain amount of gore was necessary to the movie's story, but when the gore overshadows the story, I think the movie becomes more of a display of gore for the sake of gore.  In other words, it takes more than imagination and gore to be a great horror movie, and Clive Barker fails to create the ever elusive classic horror experience in ""Hellraiser"".Given the criticisms of this movie, I still recommend renting ""Hellraiser"" just to be able to have said that you have watched it if nothing else, but don't expect it to live up to the raving reviews it has received on Amazon because it simply isn't that scary, nor is it great, and I feel very confident that sophisticated horror movie fans will see exactly what I mean when they watch it.  After having read these glowing reviews, I can honestly say that I was disappointed with ""Hellraiser"".  2.5 STARS for ""Hellraiser"" for the fact that it is a decent (but flawed) horror movie, imaginative and entertaining to some extent.  However, for the reasons mentioned herein, I would conclude by saying that I do not think that ""Hellraiser"" is a great horror movie or a classic horror movie by any stretch of the imagination.",N/A

777168,"I have enjoyed the music of Gary Moore for several years, but being in the States he seldom makes his way over here.  Since this was the case, I was glad to see the release of a DVD filmed at this years ""Monsters Of Rock"" tour.  This piece was filmed as part of Gary touring for his ""Scars"" album.  Joining him in the band is Cass Lewis on bass, and Darrin Mahoney on drums.  Fans might be interested in the fact that Gary seems to have stepped back into his roots of Rock once again.  He took some time off and became a blues man (and while it was done quite well), I still like to see him kicking some serious ass on the strings.  He has not lost any of his skill at this medium.This DVD is essentially a straight ahead concert from beginning to end.  The only additional footage is several minutes of sound-check and some backstage interview footage.  These two portions serve as the Bonus Features, making that aspect somewhat lacking.  Given the scope of Gary Moore's back catalog, Sanctuary should have included a couple of videos, or perhaps even some vintage footage from other ""Monsters Of Rock"" festivals.  Gary Moore has been a steady performer at this festival, so the footage has to be out there and this is what fans will want to see.The DVD moves quite quickly also.  I found this not only because of its 63 minute length but because the songs flow so smoothly.  It was over before I knew it, so I let it run again to just listen to the songs.  I am guessing the shortness of its length was because Gary was on the opening spot during this tour for Whitesnake.  63 minutes seems like a normal running time for a pre-headliner goes onstage.  The songs are listed below for the reader, I was surprised to see two of my favorites excluded (""I'm Always Gonna Love You"", and ""Victims Of The Future"".Song Listing:Shapes Of Things To Come, Wishing Well, Rectify, Guitar Intro, Stand Up, Just Can't Let You Go, Walking By Myself, Don't Believe A Word, Out In The Fields, Parisienne Walkways.While I have the aforementioned criticisms I did enjoy this DVD quite a bit.

838500,"Sanford and Son's 5th season shows one of the best sitcoms ever created running out of steam. While Redd Foxx was funny as ever, especially when he was insulting Aunt Esther, the writing really went downhill. Fred Sanford seemed to becoming the Ralph Kramden of the '70s, entering one big money making scheme after another (selling Whopper Choppers, having a circus in his junkyard, opening a Japanese restaurant in his house, etc). Grady, played by Whitman Mayo, made far less appearances due to his ill-fated spinoff of the same name. There were still several funny episodes in Season 5 with the best being ""The Over The Hill Gag"" and ""Bank On This"" from Disc 1 and ""Sanford And Son Rising"", ""The Olympics"", ""The Oddfather"", and ""Can You Chop This"" from Disc 2. As stated earlier, the writing was getting stale. In ""Brother, Can You Spare An Act?"", Fred and Lamont show their singing and tap dancing skills respectively. Which makes you ask the question, ""Why are they working in a junkyard?"" The ""Steinberg And Son"" episode, where Fred and Lamont attempt to sue over a show that copies their lives, was very unrealistic.

Third, there is the ex-con who is remaking his life as a born-again christian and is lucky to be loved - he takes responsibility for a car accident that claims the lives of the wife's family.What makes this film so outstanding is the actors:  they are absolutely first rate and you feel what they are going thru as they question life and try to cope.  It is so utterly believable that it is very painful to watch:  you feel their conflict and the meaninglessness that threatens to engulf each of them, but also how they reach the point where the survivors can go on.  With all of their flaws and the ambiguous outcome, this is not a simplistic hollywood feel-good film where all's well that ends well.  It is brilliant art that reflects on life.  The time shifts are also quite interesting and are not hard to follow as a narrative that is not quite linear.Warmly recommended.",21 Grams

I think it's because the ensemble characters are so great and really make each other stand out.Another great thing about this set is the anime and music. I was very pleased with this storyline because it's really different from what I normally see, not just in anime but books in general. It's one of those few shows that is a melodramatic/comedy and really works well. One minute I'm laughing my  butt off and the next I'm crying my eyes out.This series really goes through a whole range of emotions and keeps you entertained.",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky
625673,"""I, Robot"" is a good action film with spectacular special effects aided by superb CG visual effects. As for the story itself, it is a fascinating premise that is acted out in an ""decent"" story. Will Smith does some of his best work to date, and Bridget Moynahan is beautiful and engaging. The rest of the cast does as good a job as they can with the slight let-down of a story.Overall, ""I, Robot"" is an above-standard action epic. It may not be the greatest action film ever, but it is better than ""The Day After Tomorrow!""The current DVD presents a commentary track and a twelve-minute featurette. A 2-Disc Collector's DVD Edition is coming out in May. I suggest you wait for that one to buy it! It will be more loaded than this DVD!Movie/DVD Grade: B+","I, Robot"
907956,"First the bad news.... this DVD has some sound issues.  Sometimes Super Safe Chick is speaking but the instrumental music is drowning her out.  We found ourselves constantly raising and lowering the volume since things are happening so fast in the movie.  It may just be a defect in our particular DVD.... we will check into it.Now the good news! This is an EXCELLENT movie to teach kids about protecting themselves from strangers.  Super Safe Chick (SSC)is VERY VERY funny!  My dd actually wants to dress up as her for Halloween. So many clever things in this dvd..like when SSC is in certain situations she wears clothing that is either Green (in safe situations), Amber (in cautious ones) and Red (in danger type situations).  She teaches the kids about the 3 types of people in their lives (""Safe Side Adults"" - mom, dad, and others whom mom and dad have given their trust,  ""Kinda Knows"" - family friends, neighbors, coaches, teachers,  and ""Don't Knows"" - anyone not in the other 2 categories)The movie shows certain situations - ie standing in line at the ice cream truck - SSC is in her red outfit,  hanging at home she is in her green outfit until the doorbell rings... her outfit turns red and she is upset because she knows she shouldn't answer the door without her Safe Side Adult present.  The doorbell keeps ringing and getting louder and she gets louder herself saying ""Some people hate hearing the doorbell ring and they want to answer it - but I won't!  My Safe Side Adult is not here""...then her mom appears and they open the door together and she is back in her green outfit. VERY CLEVER!!!She practices with the kids yelling ""This is not my Mom, This is not my Dad"" - so of course my kids were shouting it for about 30 minutes at the top of their lungs.  But it opened up a wonderful discussion.  We made our list of Safe Side Adults and people who fell into the other category.  The movie is VERY quick - things happen quickly so while my 3 yr old LOVED watching it....she got minimal out of it except what to yell and not to open the door or follow people looking for animals.  But my 9 year old asked us questions for about an hour afterwards.  I would think children ages 5-12 would get the most out of it.  But adults will find it perfect for opening conversations - and very funny even though a very serious topic.",The Safe Side - Stranger Safety: Hot Tips To Keep Cool Kids Safe With People They Don't Know And Kinda Know

Once thought to be simply the Castle, they must now recognize that in the 20th Century, all of Manhattan Island needs their protection.In Season II, the ""Manhattan Clan"" now discovers how much the city needs them.  In the episodes brought into this DVD, fans discover more magic exists than once thought, they finally discover HOW it was Macbeth that named the troubled-Gargoyle Demona, and just how Machiavellian David Xanatos, the man responisble for bringing Goliath and his clan back in Season I to Manhattan, can be . . . especially after returning from prison!Speaking of Xanatos, we EVEN find out how he became the man he is!

795597,"Dewey Finn is a 30-something slacker with aspirations of being in a successful rock band but who can't seem to make it happen.  His latest collaborators have just kicked him out, so he spends his time sleeping and eating, until he intercepts a phone call meant for his roommate, who works as a substitute teacher.  When he finds out how much the job pays, he decides to fake his way into it, intending to slack off some more and pick up a paycheck.  Then he happens to catch the students at band practice, and discovers that his perfect rock band might be sitting right under his nose.Even though I really like most of Richard Linklater's films (WAKING LIFE, BEFORE SUNRISE, TAPE), I had no plans to see this one originally for a couple reasons:  1. I don't much care for kids in my films.  2. I don't much care for Jack Black; though he is amusing in smaller roles (HIGH FIDELITY) I was pretty sure he'd be intolerable as a central character.  But recently I saw the trailer and thought it looked like it might be kind of funny, so I decided to give it a chance.  It was much better than I expected.  Black keeps his manic act under control for the most part, and is quite entertaining (and his character becomes surprisingly likable once he gets his act together.)  The kids are - dare I say it? - actually charming.  And the script by Mike White (THE GOOD GIRL) is smart and funny.This film, which features a cast of nine to eleven year-olds, is rated PG-13 for ""rude humor and drug references.""  They say ""ass"" a few times and the ""drug references"" must have been so vague that I can't even remember any.  A beer is sipped gingerly at a restaurant, and Dewey mentions that he has a hangover on the first day of class.  Oh, I know what it was; Dewey says that one of the other teachers ""must be on crack.""  Anyway, you'd have to be insanely uptight to worry about any of these things.  I have no qualms about recommending this as a family film, an intelligent one that both kids and adults will enjoy because it doesn't talk down to either.  It's also a genuine feel-good movie, not in the fake, sugary way that makes you feel like throwing up.  It has a real heart, and even a little subversive edge to it.The DVD contains numerous extras including two commentary tracks (one with Black and Linklater which is moderately interesting, and one with the kids which is extremely annoying), behind the scenes footage, film festival footage, trailers, and a video plea they made to try to convince Led Zeppelin to let them use one of their songs.",School of Rock
689104,"What can you say about Oz other than watch it?Several people have described the show as ""addictive"" - it really is, the very nature of a prison being a barren, essentially monotone and boring place means the show has to rely 100% on engaging characters - the true anchor of any great TV show or film. This is where Oz shines, the range of colourful characters really does get you hooked, and the futuristic pod-style housing gives the EmCity wing a certain flavour that would definitely not be present if the series was set in an older, more traditional looking jail.There's no yardtime in Oz! I think these guys are just too dangerous to be let outside. There's certainly a noticable bodycount to say the least.If you're looking for a down-to-earh, realistic portrayal of prison then despite what some reviewers seem to be saying or implying: OZ ain't it. It's over the top and paints in vivid colour where real prison would be using greys and blacks, but this is what makes it entertaining.Oz has a very dark sense of humour to it which is almost hilarious at times but trust me when I say you have to have to be able to appreciate dark humour to find certain parts funny - much in the same vain as Australian celebrity criminal flick ""Chopper"". If you can look through the litres of prop blood and the hammed up actor screaming his head off while a steroid-infested TripleH look-alike puts his floor-sharpened spoon to wicked use then you might find a wry smile creeping onto your face - although I must admit that at times the violence crosses a line and there doesn't seem to be any sanctuary available while witnessing a character you really got to know and like being tortured to death by someone who's laughing at his face while he's doing it. You have to play it by ear in this respect.Don't get me wrong, it's not a comedy, but certain parts certainly appear to me to be deliberately blackly comic - not everyone will agree though, not everyone can see past the essentially unfunny jailhouse window-dressing. I just don't think such an over the top steroid fuelled roller-coaster of a show such as Oz should be taken too seriously is all.Watch it and enjoy it cos it is one of the most entertaining and unique shows ever to grace your TV screen.Compulsive viewing!!!",Oz: Season 1

Eddie Hawkins, the World's Greatest Cat Burglar, is recruited for the Next Big Job, first by his new parole officer while being released from prision, then by the mob and finally by the CIA. Despite his desire to go straight, and his intense desire to finally have some cappuccino after a long prision stay, Hawk falls into a tailspin the just keeps getting stranger and stranger.Aiello and Willis are great together, James Coburn eats up the screen as the determined CIA agent who is wistful for the Good Old Days of the Cold War. (Older fans will catch the musical In Like Flint reference heard in the movie.) Andie McDowell turns in a great comic performace which reaches into other dimensions when she starts to 'talk to the dolphins'. And Sandra Bernhardt is smashing as one half of the evil duo pulling all the strings. Don't miss Miami CSI's David Caruso as Agent Kit Kat.Hudson Hawk may be a Willis vanity piece, but its sense of fun and almost complete disconnection from actual reality make it well worth the ride.Did I mention the Homicidal Butler with retractable knives up his sleeves?8.5/10",N/A

636820,"MOVIE: Steve Carell is one hilarious guy.  He was the funniest part of Bruce Almighty, the funniest part of Anchorman, and his show The Office is just plain funny.  This late summer comedy should have been released earlier in the summer, maybe it would have made more money.  Hopefully word of mouth will carry it, because audiences are loving it and critics are too.  The movie is absolutely hilarious.  Carell plays this quiet guy who works at an electronics shop and he gives this guy lots of charm.  This movie actually has character because we get some flashbacks of his past experiences with women and how they fail miserably.  So in a basic sense we do have depth in the character and that allows the audience to connect more.  There are ""scenes"" in this movie like in most comedies because the movie flows very nicely.  For instance in Wedding Crashers there was the ""dinner scene"" or the ""bedroom scene"".  In Anchorman there was the ""news team fight scene"".  This movie really has only one ""scene"" and that would be ""the waxing scene"".  Overall the movie flows and the comedy is layed out within it.  There are some hilarious moments in this one and the ending is probably one of the funniest things I have seen in quite some time.  It's also a nice addition to the ""R"" rated comedy genre.  Previously, only the Farrelly Brothers were able to give us laugh out loud ""R"" rated comedy.  This summer we had the very funny Wedding Crashers and now the even funnier 40-Year Old Virgin.  The character that Carell plays is so simple-minded that it makes it very easy for the audience to connect with.  This movie has enough charm and heart to make it a sappy romance movie, but it also has enough crude sex humor to make it just plain hilarious.ACTING: Steve Carell is a very funny man and he proves that he is more than a supporting actor with this role.  He carries the role with ease and he does not steal the show from the other actors and actresses in the film.  The entire cast in this movie is hilarious and Carell does not have all the funny scenes in the movie, and I'm glad it's like that.BOTTOM LINE: It has character and it has some crude sex humour, it is hilarious.  The end will have you laughing into the credits, and you will be glad you took the time to see it.  I found this to be funnier than Wedding Crashers and an overall better comedy.  It's a real standout when compared to the other trash that's in the theaters right now.",N/A

624220,"After seeing such harch critiscm of Anchorman, my expectations of this comedy were mighty low. But it is exactly those low expectations that led me to enjoy this movie.Sure...a lot of the jokes most any dunce could understand, but that's one of the points that makes Anchorman so enojyable and accesible. While it's not a comdey classic, it is a entertaining time to spend when you have a few hours to spare.The plot focuses around the Channel 4 News studio and the hijinks that occur after a woman is hired as a correspondant. The leading News Anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is quickly smitten with the new newswoman. And hilarity ensues.The character that produces the biggest laughs would have to be Brick, played by Steve Carrell. Will Ferrell deffinitly has his moments as well.While a few of the jokes are lame and don't get across, most of it is simple, harmless, and fun. If you are looking for something with a little more depth, this probably is not for you. Though, if you are looking for a light movie to raise your spirits, this is worth a try.",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

I've given this DVD a three because of these two sections. The actual practice was disappointing. There are no submenus for the Salutation A and B, you just have to skip forward through the practice if you want to do a portion. When I did practice straight through I found Nicki's voice quite abrasive. I'm sorry to say that because I think it is a good practice and in time I'm hoping her voice doesn't irritate me. I doubt I'll be bringing this one out a whole lot. A softer voice and better music would have improved this practice.",N/A

After watching the DVD version without interruptions I found it very entertaining and well done.  The casting was really good with the character of Alice Cooper stealing much of the show for me, as children so often do. For those who enjoy this genre, i.e.  supernatural vision drama, this movie works well.  Like much of today's Hollywood production, the chase scenes at the conclusion were somewhat overdone but did not greatly detract from the story.  Being in England set a tone or mood in the movie that could only be achieved there.  Not a great movie, but really good entertainment  -  a movie that can be enjoyed by repeated viewings.",The Sight

63796,"This film is grand in scale with cinematography and special effects that could not be bettered.  The river's rage is nothing compared to the characters undergoing their conflict.  Sissy Spacek, as usual, turns in another stunning performance (when has she ever been less than excellent in any movie.  Definitely, along with Meryl Streep, the finest actress of her generation...I call her my modern ""Barbara Stanwyck"").  Her portrayal of Mae, the wife, is unflinchingly loyal, yet strong and courageous and feisty.  Her determination is what makes this film what it is.  No less excellent is Scott Glenn as the antagonist/protaganist who believes in what he is doing totally.  Also meriting praise are the two children.  They are fantastic!  The direction is colorful and nearly flawless.  I agree with the previous reviewer though about Mel Gibson.  His character, a mite too proud, is a little difficult to take sometimes.  He definitely could have shown more bite in the scene where he is attacked by the strikers.  The scene where he confronts Scott Glenn in the office is his best scene in this movie.  But he definitely could have done a better job with the character.  He seems miscast at times.  Sissy Spacek makes him look good but his portrayal of the character lacks the nuances necessary to make us believe in what he is doing.  It is Spacek that gives us the sympathy for her family.  I wish they would have cast Gary Busey in Gibson's role.  I think he could have done wonders with it!  Other than that, this film is outstanding and I would definitely give it 5 stars if it hadn't been for Gibson's uneven portrayal.  Spacek deserved her Oscar nomination for this movie.  The DVD contains a theatrical trailer, scene selection and a two page commentary on the highlights of the film.  ALso included are Bios of the stars.  Other than that, nothing else is included.  The sound and video are fine!  This is a film worth adding to your collection!  A true testament to the American fighting Spirit.

735418,"CSI is simply the best US police procedural drama (which, given how many there are, is saying quite a lot).The stories are strong and there is a cast of interesting characters. The central character, Gil Grissom (brilliantly played by William Peterson) is the reason it works so well. Grissom is wonderful character - an introverted and rather unemotional man, a serious scientist who happens to be a criminologist. As such he is free for most of the traditional TV cop baggage, giving the whole series a fresh and interesting perspective. In this series, the CSI team gets on with investigating crime scenes and solving mysteries attempting, but not always succeeding, to do this without bias or preconceptions. They leave the police work to others. Unfortunately, this model was abandoned with CSI: Miami making it a much less interesting program.The rest of the cast is also very, very good bringing complex and interesting characters to life. Marg Helgenberger as ex-exotic dancer Catherine Willows is particularly good.Danny Boyle directs most of the episodes with great style (redeeming himself after the failure of Judge Dread), even his habit of focussing in at a microscopic level (e.g. looking at blood vessels etc) works well. Setting the series in Las Vegas works well - the city, the desert, the mountains - they all provide great backdrops and look fantastic.This is not the best CSI series (the show really got going in series 2) but it makes sense to start at the beginning.",N/A

228321,"Predator, to my mind, is not just the Best Ah-nuld movie, just nudging out T2, but it might be the best Action film ever put on screen, and in this collector's edition, it gets the treatment it deserves.Predator tells a rather simple story: American Special Forces operatives are ordered into the South American jungle to rescue some local government dignitaries.  After discovering and destroying the ""rebel base"" that supposedly housed the ""officials"", team leader Dutch (Arnie) discovers he's been dpuble-crossed by his old buddy, Dillon (Carl Weathers), now a CIA man.  This could have been a great movie right there, but Predator adds an alien that kills for sport that's dropped right into the jungle and begins picking off the squad.  What follows are a number of spectacular action scenes and just the right amount of dialouge that shows just how scared these guys, the baddest of the bad, are of this thing that's hunting them.  The script is lean and mean, never giving up more than it has to, and the direction by John McTiernen is perfect as well.  We're only given an idea of what the Predator really is and what it can do, until the final showdown in the jungle.  The suspense, for an adrenaline fuled action flick, is layed on with the right amount of frightened humor and energing dread as each character begins to realize they're probably not going to make it home.  The film never fails to entertain, and has a rewatchability factor that's off the charts.The DVD Collector's Edition that FOX has put out is a joy to behold for Predator fans.  The first disc features a DTS soundtrack that will shake your bones, especially when Jessie Ventura is firing the minigun.  The predator's sound effects, from the breathing to the ""lock on target"" sounds are crisp, and the dialouge never gets overwhelmed by the action.  And when it gets quiet, boy is it quiet.  McTiernan has a good, not great, commentary on the film that talks a bit about the problems getting the film made, which is interesting enough.  His best commentary is on ""Die Hard"", but this one is good.  The text commentary with technical details is fun to have on as well.Disc 2 is a great tribute the whole film, with a new Documentary that gives time to all of the actors, filmmakers, and the writer.  You get some great on-set stories from Weathers, Arnie, McTiernan and Ventura, and the is supplemented with seven featurettes that show the wierd looking lobster like costume the special effects guys came up with.  It's Van Damme in the suit, which is even funnier.  The disc is rounded out with a couple of deleted scens and the trailer.For Predator fans, this is the disc that you need to own.  FOX has been putting some terrific collections together since they abandoned the ""5-Star"" collection, and this is one of their finest.  Grab it now.",N/A

906539,"High school Senior, Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) longs to be an ice princess, but due to her gawky body, and not enough money for ice skating lessons, she has had to settle for being a science geek. The brainy girl who gets perfect grades, but never has much fun. But all that is about to change. When Casey is given the opportunity to win a Physics Scholarship to Harvard by throwing herself head-first into a project on the ice, she realizes that even with her feminist mother's (Joan Cusack) pushing and prodding, there are more important things than being the best at school. Like having fun on the ice. So Casey discovers a mathematical formula that helps her figure out just how her fellow classmates are doing those tricky stunts, and quickly follows her own instructions to become as graceful on the ice as them. Of course, she soon realizes that she can't go it alone, and enlists the help of some nice-girl skaters, as well as a coach who can show her the ropes to win.When I heard that one of my favorite authors, Meg Cabot (author of THE PRINCESS DIARIES) was penning the script for this film, I knew that I couldn't miss it. Luckily, I was not in any way disappointed. Michelle Trachtenberg (HARRIET THE SPY and INSPECTOR GADGET) is wonderful as brainiac Casey; and Joan Cusack (RAISING HELEN and SCHOOL OF ROCK) is very convincing as a mother who only wants the best for her daughter, even if it means pushing her away. However, in my opinion, I feel that the performances by Kim Cattrall (SEX AND THE CITY and CROSSROADS), as well as her on-screen daughter Hayden Panettiere (RAISING HELEN and RACING STRIPES) stole the movie. Cattrall could not be more perfect in her role of a pushy, demanding skating coach; and Panettiere is amazing in her role as the reluctant skater who wants to spend her time hanging out with her boyfriend, and eating junk food, which is totally different from what she has spent her time doing over the years. Then there's Casey's love interest, Trevor Blumas (GUILT BY ASSOCIATION and THE UNSAID) who is every girls fantasy, as the nice guy who drives the zamboni.Throughout the film, viewers are treated to splendid ice action that will leave everyone's head spinning. We also get to see guest appearances from some professional skaters, such as Michelle Kwan, playing herself. As well as Kirsten Olson (playing Nikki) also known as ""The Jumping Shrimp,"" because she jumps in all of her performances. Quite high, I might add; and Juliana Cannarozzo (playing Zoe Bloch) a girl who truly rocks out on the ice. The performances seen in this movie, both on the ice and off, will please the whole family, from the youngest member to the oldest member, and may even have your children begging to become the next Ice Princess. Overall, this was an enjoyable movie that is more of a drama that should be watched with the whole family, than a great pre-teen/teen comedy that should be watched with your pals. For you'll find yourself shedding more tears during this film than chuckling aloud.Erika SoroccoFreelance ReviewerBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",N/A
890711,"Bellydance for Body Shaping uses bellydance floorwork moves as a foundation for a fun yet challeging workout. The atmosphere is lovely, the music fantastic, and the instructor Tanna is great. She is personable and clear throughout her insrtuction. This DVD has complete warm-ups and cool-downs, including an introduction about the muscle groups used. Tanna makes sure you do each excercise properly so you don't put strain your back, hips, or knees. The workouts are broken down into 3 sessions. As each session progresses, the next is a bit more challenging. Tanna gives a short performance incorporating the moves at the end of each session.With such a great production, I am not sure what happened with some of the camera-work. You can tell the camera is hand held through parts of the DVD, giving you that slight bobbing feeling. And in the beginnging, it seemed like the camera person is too close to Tanna and can't get her quite into the whole shot, so they angle it. At this angle (tilt your head to one side), it is very distracting when you are trying to follow along.

393153,"Suffering a nearly unanimous beating from critics, and grossing a meer 2 million, Mallrats will always be an underappreciated gem. The second in The New Jersey ""Trilogy"" Mallrats focuses on T.S. and Brodie, two hapless fellows who were recently dumped by their girlfriends, so they take solace at their local mall. There they run into some old friends, such as Willam, a guy who does nothing than stare at the magic eye, their old friend from High School Gwen, and of course Jay and Silent Bob. Brodie is trying to believe that he's over his old girlfriend Rene, while T.S. is still hung over about his old girlfriend Brandi. T.S. won't give up trying to win Brandi back, so he thinks that he should try and wreck her father's game show. Jay and Silent Bob decide to do that, while Brodie and T.S. wander around the mall. They discuss Superman's sex life, where the food court is exactly, and get kicked out of the mall. That event takes them to the dirt mall, where probably the funniest scene in the movies. Yes, I'm talking about the topless fortune teller scene, where T.S. makes a breakthrough about his past relationship, but where Brodie is just repulsed. Underrated, but wonderful. Yeah, Jeremy London [T.S.] isn't very good at acting but Jason Lee is hilarious as Brodie. How could the critics not like this movie? It's not nearly as crude as Clerks, but critics hated it. There are some thinks that I'll never understand. Since it went out of print, it's kinda hard to find a copy, but try and get a hold of it. Or you could wait to buy the X Anniverary edition later this year, but I don't when it's coming out.",Mallrats VHS
262455,"Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be""(1943) has to be the most genuinely bizarre political satire to emerge from Hollywood's golden age. It stars Jack Benny and Carol Lombard as Joseph and Maria Tura - a married couple and stage performers living in occupied Poland during WWII. Determined to alter the course of the war, the two helm a troupe of ham actors in a dead pan comic assault on the Nazis When a spy emerges who has damaging information to the Polish resistance, Joseph and Maria decide to prevent the information from being delivered to the Reich. Benny's brilliant lampoon of Hamlet's soliloquy ""to be or not to be"" is at the crux of a disastrous rendezvous between Maria and Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). Stan gets the hots for Maria - a passion not reciprocated. Hence, when Stan is dispatched for war, he cruelly implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), the real spy who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The theater troupe is then forced to use their thespian skills to ensure their own survival; impersonating Nazi officers and even Hitler in order to outwit the enemy. Controversial to say the very least, ""To Be Or Not to Be"" opened to modest acclaim and was later remade, to limited effect, as a 1983 farce starring Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.Warner's DVD treatment is middle of the road. The black and white image has been mastered from reasonably clean film elements. Contrast levels are adequate, though at times weak. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are sometimes nicely realized but darker scenes suffer from inconsistent quality. Film grain is moderate. Age related artifacts are present throughout. An archival news reel and short subject are the only extras included.",To Be Or Not to Be VHS

411582,"Before being a cinematographic success The Lover (fr. l'Amant) is a masterpiece of literature, an autobiographical novel written by Marguerite Duras in 1984, in which the author reveals her torrid adolescent relationship with an older and affluent Chinese man in the Saigon of the 1930s.  Very few adaptations of novels to the screen have ever been rendered so faithfully.  Annaud is known for the meticulousness with which he approaches the details of his films, including the historical ones, and The Lover is no exceptionThe story is an interior monologue so laconically written that the film's characters aren't even named.  Jane Marsh, la jeune fille (""the girl""), acting is effortless and natural, portraying perfectly the ferocious individuality of the adolescent girl. Her resemblance to young Duras is uncanny.  Tony Leung Ka Fai, the ""Chinaman,"" is convincing in the role of the vulnerable aristocratic.The soundtrack, by Gabriel Yared, follows the action well, complementing the scenes, without overwhelming them.  The theme, ""l'Amant,"" is equally poetic and lyrical as the text.  The dialogue is the manifestation of Duras's writing, and the voice-over sequences are taken verbatim from the novel.  The genius of Annaud is again apparent in his choice of Jeanne Moreau for the narrator's part.  Moreau's world-weary, destroyed voice could not have been better for conveying the tone of Duras's lyrical writing.I was rather disappointed while reading more than a dozen American reviews of this film penned by professional film critics. Only one reviewer seemed to be knowledgeable about the author and the position she occupies in world literature.  Even one of the most respected film critics, Roger Ebert, seems to have missed the point of the film altogether, and dismissed it lightly. The majority of the film critics concentrated somewhat obsessively on the sexual scenes (which I must admit are rather explicit), to the exclusion of the other themes, and pronounced it soft-core pornography.  Since the running time of the film is 111 minutes, and only eight percent of it (a total of nine minutes) shows the two protagonists in explicitly sexual situations, including four and one half of actual lovemaking, I personally think the film hardly qualifies as soft-porn.  In my opinion, these movie reviews are the result of the genetic, generic puritan attitude that prevails in the American society.  Or maybe the reviewers were asleep during most of the film and only woke up for the ""good parts?""  So, let's put to bed (no pun intended) the question that this film is somehow pornographicThe Lover is a powerful emotional text, probing deep into the past of the narrator and into France's own colonial past.  It explores the intimate relationship between a young, poor white schoolgirl and her rich Chinese lover in the setting of the colonial society of the late 1920s Saigon.  It uncovers transgression, desire, separation, and death, the ecstatic and dangerous appeal of the mysterious ""other.""The other, arguably as important, theme of the film is relationships -- with her school friend, Helene Lagonelle, the ambivalent tie between the girl and her mother, and the girl's disturbing relationships with her two brothersFinally, there is an undercurrent theme which runs throughout the film, which is that of boundaries and borders. The film opens with a ferry ride across the Mekong and ends with an ocean crossing, signaling the constant crossing of frontiers and borders: geographic of course, but also racial, cultural, and sexual.  These are confronted and sometimes dissolved as the poor white girl of French parentage meets her wealthy Chinese lover in the Cholon, the ill-repute Chinese district of Saigon. She, a white girl, was raised among natives, almost as a native.  He is a native who experienced the western culture and somehow longs for it.There is also the transitory period of the girl's adolescence, between what remains of her childhood, and the onset of her womanhood. On the ferry and on the steam liner, the girl wears a child's pigtails, but she is dressed in women's clothes.  The gender roles are somewhat blurred, too: she wears a woman's dress, but also a man's hat, in a color that signifies femininity.  The boarding school in Saigon is home mainly to the abandoned mixed-blood daughters of local women and French fathers. The girl has an intimate friendship with Helene Lagonelle, which is ambivalent and perhaps sexually charged. The girl is unable to treat the Chinaman with even a modicum of courtesy when she is with her brothers because he is Chinese, not white. In the public bus, she rides in front, separated from the locals, yet in her private home, she lived as a native. In the cocoon of the garconniere, she is separated from the crowd on the street by only thin cotton blinds. There is even a meta-boundary crossed, as Duras takes her memories and feelings and externalizes them in the form of her writing.  What has been internal and private becomes external and public.The Lover is an autobiographical love story set in a post-colonial environment.  We owe the remarkable transcription of this literary masterpiece to the artistry and creativity of Jean-Jacques Annaud. In this production, he has successfully combined two art forms, the beauty of the written word with the fascination of the image. I believe that the film has been, for the most part, misunderstood in this country, and I would recommend a second, more open-minded look at it.  It will be a worthwhile experience.",The Lover VHS

905156,"Warning: This review may contain slight episode spoilers. My summary of the first episode (the following paragraph) and the final paragraph are safe to read if you have not yet seen Oz season five.The first episode, ""Visitation"", focuses mainly on the return of normalcy to Oz after the gas explosion in the season four finale. Whilst the prisoners are reassigned pods, Father Ray Mukada (B. D. Wong) travels with the first group of people to visit inmates at Oz after reopening its doors and converses with several of the passengers. Due to complications with the air vents in the solitary unit, Miguel Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo), Omar White (Michael Wright), and their fellow prisoners are returned to Oz for the time that it will take to repair the ventilation system in their unit. Sister Peter Marie Reimondo (Rita Moreno) talks to Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen) about having him take part in a group counselling session between him, Kareem Said (Eamonn Walker), and Vern Schillinger (J. K. Simmons), which does not start off well as one can imagine due to past conflicts, religious differences, and flaring tempers. Zahir Arif (Granville Adams), unable to keep his guilt to himself any longer from seeing Ryan O'Reily (Dean Winters) kill Patrick Keenan (Dylan Chalfy), unknowingly starts a chain of events that leads to an investigation of Keenan's murder.Episode two, ""Laws of Gravity"", focuses a great deal on newness. One example is that Alvarez, who knows if he stays out of trouble has one last chance to stay in Oz instead of going back to solitary, adopts a new way of handling his issues with Carmen ""Chico"" Guerra (Otto Sanchez). A second example is of Ryan's mother, Suzanne Fitzgerald (Betty Lynn Buckley) arriving at Em City to complete her community service. She begins to have music lessons with the prisoners, the highlights of which are Omar and Cyril O'Reily (Scott William Winters), who due to these lessons forms a bond with Suzanne. A third example is The Governor of the mystery state Oz exists in (Utah has been ruled out as a suspect) appears to form a liaison between the prison and the government and of course she happens to have some history with a certain womaniser who will remain blatantly obvious. This is also the first episode in the season that Bob Rebadow (George Morfogen) begins to take a larger step toward centre stage due to his grandson's fight with leukemia. The investigation into Keenan's death continues as Ryan continues to thwart any attempt made to prove him the guilty party. Meanwhile, Tim McManus (Terry Kinney) comes up with a plan to not only to help Omar, who he does not want to give up on despite all that Omar has done to him, but Said as well whose barely suppressed rage worsens with each passing episode until he reaches his breaking point later on in the season.Episode three, ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"", includes a questionable truce between Alvarez and Enrique Morales (David Zayas) and an alliance between Burr Redding (Anthony Chisholm) and Morales that is unbelievable to say the least. Just as Ryan is returning to his smug attitude, difficulties arise when Jia Kenmin (Michael Delmare) returns to Oz and Sister Peter Marie arranges for a victim/offender counselling session between Kenmin, Ryan and Cyril. Chris Keller (Christopher Meloni) returns to Oz only to be sent to protective custody within moments of entering the building. Whilst all of this is happening, Rebadow continues searching for a way to save his grandson, and despite its rocky start, Said continues to try and save Omar from himself through the sponsorship, which is not an easy task.Season four, ""Next Stop: Valhalla"" introduces a programme that gives three inmates the ability to take care of three dogs whilst training them as guide dogs. Katherine McClain (Sandra Purpuro) agrees to be Chris's lawyer, but due to her feelings for Tobias and her personal belief system it is evident that this will, thankfully, be a short-lived arrangement. Tobias is temporarily distracted from the knowledge that he is being kept from seeing Chris when an old family friend is brought into Oz and needs his protection from the Aryans. Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau Jr.) reverts to his old habits and Omar finds release in music.Episode five, ""Wheel of Fortune"", was possibly one of the least interesting in the season, in my opinion, although the O'Reily brothers' storyline definitely hits new levels of intense emotions. Said loses his patience with Omar. Schillinger attempts to get Tobias to trade the chance to see Chris for the man Tobias is trying to protect from the Aryans. Rebadow discovers that his idea of getting money for his grandson's cure was successful, but complications arise. Augustus ends up in the infirmary and Redding searches for the one responsible.Episode six, ""Variety"", contains segments of some of the stars of the show singing, including a very interesting solo by Wong and a truly frightening duet with Tergesen and Schillinger, instead of the usual narrative by Harold Perrineau Jr. due to the fact that he was needed on the set of The Matrix Reloaded. Omar and Said become closer although Omar chooses to secretly betray McManus and Said when he needs to come up with the courage to stand up in front of his fellow inmates to sing. McClain, fed up with Chris's lies and Tobias's feelings for Chris, leaves Oz and drops Chris's case. Tobias, growing more anxious by the day to see Chris decides to take Schillinger up on his offer but circumstances beyond his control proves the entire thing to be a huge mistake and Tobias is confronted (literally) with the consequences of his actions.Episode seven, ""Good Intentions"", is another rather slow episode in this season, again, in my opinion. A few highlights though from the episode includes McManus trying to help Rebadow find some help for his grandson whose condition is getting worse and worse with each passing day. James Robson (R. E. Rodgers) is dismissed from the Aryan brotherhood upon his return to Unit B after dental surgery leaves him forever changed in their eyes. Tobias has a conversation with Said about his guilt over accepting Schillinger's offer and arrives at a fair but displeasing conclusion.Episode eight, ""Impotence"", brings the entire season to a head, and I did not at all mean for that to seem like a bad pun but you may take it as one if you wish. Robson makes up his mind that he will get the brotherhood to accept him once again despite however they feel about it. Omar tries to protect Said against a prisoner in Unit B who is looking to join the Aryan brotherhood. Busmalis finally receives a visit from the woman who left him at the altar but it does not go as he would have preferred. Thanks to Tobias who has proven once again that he is a good man despite his many flaws, justice finally prevails. The Latinos and Sicilians form an alliance that proves deadly after Augustus returns to Oz after recuperating.The greatest aspect of Oz is the relentless intensity of human emotion ranging from grief to love to fury. The actors and actresses that make up the cast are all incredibly talented men and women. This season through all the emerging and unfolding storylines, there were a few actors who particularly caught my attention with their talents. For instance, Kirk Acevedo, Michael Wright, Eamonn Walker, and Dean Winters all had very challenging scenes in nearly every episode that with the wrong actor, just could not have caused the viewing audience to care so much for their individual predicaments. What continually attracts me to this show is not the drama, violence, or full frontal nudity shots, but the characters' relationships with one another and their personal developments. There are a lot of good shows either currently on air or on DVD but there are very few truly great shows. This just happens to be one of those ""truly great shows"" that more people should watch for the refreshing, fast-moving episodes that are brimming with intensity, intrigue, and emotion.",Oz: Season 5

502474,"It's fitting that Francois Truffaut's final movie before his death should pay direct homage to the one director he admired above all others: Alfred Hitchcock. This is a murder mystery in the tradition of the master, right down to the little comic touches; even the love story is straight Hitchcock.The story is too complicated to actually summarize, but it begins with a man being shot while hunting, an innocent man being accused, and his secretary helping him prove his innocence and falling in love with him at the same time. (Based on just that about a half-dozen Hitchcock films should come to mind.) Two more dead bodies show up, the chase leads to Nice and other places, and leads crop up and disappear before the real murderer is apprehended. At times the story line gets too complicated to follow, and coincidences occur left and right, but Truffaut by this point in his career was only interested in making good entertainments - and in that he succeeded admirably.

626374,"""Collateral"" delivers an interesting story with a tight pace, with some intense action sequences. It has good acting but does not delve too deep into its characters. And we wouldn't expect it too, because the whole story takes place in the course of one night. However, the cast of characters does make enough interesting revelations about themselves as the movie progresses to keep the plot moving along.The best part I thought was the action. Tom Cruise plays ""Vincent"", a contract assassin who has the good looks of a GQ male model, the suave intellectual capacity of a business negotiator (at one point he dishes out an impromptu jazz trivia about where Miles Davis went to school to learn music), and the deft killing skills of a Navy Seal. There's a really cool scene where he takes out a battalion of bodyguards, cops and hitman in a dance club to finally execute his target. Jamie Foxx is convincing at playing a cabbie going about his daily doldrums, and is gradually pushed past the border of sanity by his involuntary role in a killing spree. He eventually reacts to it in the most heroic and unthinkable way. Foxx is good in this movie, but I'm not sure if he's Oscar-good.This movie gave me a vibe like ""Training Day"", where characters are forced into a situation together, and people begin to reveal themselves bit by bit, as they are not really whom they seem to be. Eventually you know someone is going to be pushed to act totally beyond their normal behavior. The action is intense and tight here too, and definitely kept me at the edge of my seat.  3 & 1/2 Stars.",Collateral

337204,"Picture this scene (mild spoilers): Shapely Paulette Goddard, `working girl, honest but tough', is swimming ashore from the hired boat that ferried her from mainland Cuba to the island she has inherited from a Cuban relative. The ferryman will not land on the island after nightfall because it is supposedly haunted by ghosts and zombies. It is midnight, there is fog on the water and the moon is out. Paulette carries afloat a minuscule pyramid-shaped celluloid tote bag, which contains a dressing gown and a pair of sandals, which is the sum total of her wardrobe in the remainder of the film. Her swimming cap, Hollywood-style, has left her long brown curls miraculously dry, fluffy and manageable. She makes her way through the ferns of the parrot-infested jungle and into the haunted castle's moonlit cathedral-like main hall. She calls for Larry (Bob Hope), who is supposed to meet her there. No one answers but the echo of her own voice. Suddenly overcome by the strangeness, loneliness and eeriness of her situation and surroundings, she starts hearing her own inner voice, whispering at first and then shouting more and more urgently: `Get out... Get out... before it's too late!' She goes to exit the castle hall when she is confronted by the vision of a moonlit Black zombie stumbling towards her with murder in his eyes. She lets out a piercing scream and runs to the castle's monumental staircase. Her white bathrobe gets caught on a splinter of the balustrade. For interminable moments, she tries to free herself, immobile as in a nightmare where the dreamer runs to no avail. Finally the bathrobe tears apart, revealing one half of her swimsuit-clad body and her beautiful, long legs. She rushes upstairs and disappears behind the first door she sees.What is remarkable about this scene is that every one of its elements is now a cinematic clich&eacute; that didn't exist before `Ghost Breakers' was shot. Everything from the script, the atmospheric lighting and photography, to the wardrobe, the sets and the music is a precedent-setting tour de force that would inspire all the Universal Studio horrors to come without ever being equalled for suspense and immediacy. And this is a Bob Hope comedy...I love this film because it is really before its time. It's a successful blend of mystery, horror, chills and fine comedy. Bob Hope's manservant Alex (Willie Best) has all the best lines, which come in very handy to defuse some of the tension created by the most atmospheric package to ever grace an American movie screen until that time. The film never stops being intriguing from the opening scene of a thunderstorm above Manhattan to the hilarious epilogue. The night photography of the moonlit castle is especially gripping.The theatrical trailer for this film (which comes with both the VHS and the DVD version) is probably the first known instance of the use of the theremin in a film soundtrack. How cool is that!This is also one of Bob Hope's funniest performances and a great way to remember him.P.S.: Like many commentators, I first saw this film on the late show as a kid and remembered it as the most chilling horror picture I had ever seen and only got to understand the jokes later.

That is quite an accomplishment.This mess starts off with the long, boring story detailing the origin of the villain of this film; the short guy with the dirty beard who runs around with a knife. He is supposed to be some evil, immortal pirate who kills anybody who:a. is in his field of vision, especially if you are wearing a skimpy bikini (I've never really found hoochies cut up and covered in their own blood attractive - obviously the director has this fetish)b. tries to steal his treasure (all pirates have treasures to guard - Arrrgh!)c. tries to prevent him from recovering his treasure (he lost it when he was imprisoned many years ago, before he became immortal. Arrrgh!)The victims are a group of idiots who are participating in a ""Survivor""-type show. They all decide to frolic on this short killer's island.What really shocked me about this poorly filmed, cheap D-grade movie was the incredibly racist portrayal of one of the pirate's victims - a rap star of course. All this guy needed was a Watermellon and a bucket of chicken. It was much worse than Coolio's ""performance"" in Dracula 3000.Skip this one at all costs.",Crossbones
834818,"I'll start off by speculating a bit: if this was Jim Jarmusch's way of playing a joke on global audiences by making an awful film to see if they'd revel on it afraid as to not be hip, well, he failed. The audiences hated it. And they didnt care about being hip.If on the other hand, and here's the worst part, Jim Jarmusch actually completed this film thinking he made a hip, funny, ""alternative"" and kinda weird movie revolving around people just sipping coffee and puffing away on cigarettes, well he failed again. And gave a bad name to smoking and coffee drinking on top of it.Then again maybe he was experimenting (for all i know) by letting people do the coffee thingie without any script and simply allowing them to improvise and say whatever lines crossed their skulls. Nope, i checked in the credits and it says ""written and directed by Jim Jarmusch"". Of course we dont really know what his idea of ""writting"" is, but we cant know everything, can we...I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone suicidal, anyone who wants to give up coffee and/or anyone neurotic or intelligent. Nor to anyone in desperate need to save even the three dollars for the rental. Come to think of it, i wouldnt even reccommend this to people i dont like because i'd know 100% they wouldnt actually see it till the end, and thus my goal to ruin their night through-n-through would be foiled.""Coffee and Cigarettes"" is excruciatingly unfunny, bar a few lines here and there which you can get for free in a real environment (i.e a real coffee shop) just by listening in to strangers.

515916,"This DVD brings us a pair of movies from director Ray Kellogg, whose most notable work would be the John Wayne film ""The Green Berets.""  But long before he worked with the Duke, Kellogg made a couple of low budget monster movies that show you what sort of creatures you come up with when you do not have any money.  The good news is that one of those two bad B-movies should tickle your fancy and make the double feature worth the viewing.""The Giant Gila Monster"" is one of those films where you take a real animal and having it crawl through miniature sets. The tagline for this film was: ""Only Hell could breed such an enormous beast. Only God could destroy it!"" But this 1959 film made in north Texas for $138,000, is a lot more low-keyed than those lines would suggest. In fact, what is interesting given when this film is made is the key relationship between Sheriff Jeff (Fred Graham) and young Chase Winstead (Don Sullivan). The kid is working on his hot rod and instead of busting his chops the sheriff really functions as a mentor: he says he is concerned about the kids in town, and you actually believe it. The idea of having a movie in which a teenage hot rodder, who also sings like Pat Boone who is not a juvenile delinquent, or at least treated like one by the cops, is rather refreshing, although admittedly the character is a bit heavy on the saccharine. But Sullivan has a natural charm and the guy wrote his own songs, so give him some credit.But since we are talking letting a Gila monster wander through miniatures in a film with teenage hot rodders, of course this movie received ""MST3K"" treatment (Season 4, when Joel turned Crow and Servo into ""The Thing With Two Heads"" as inspired by the movie of the same name""). My major complaint about this film is that the day for night shooting is so dark I have a hard time figuring out what is happening. Obviously the special effects budget is such that most of the ""horror"" is suggested by quick cuts rather than actually showing everything. Still, I like the way that everybody is pretty level headed in this film and deal with the giant Gila monster in a relatively intelligent manner without wasting a lot of time and effort. Yes, finding the monster, which is the size of several houses, should not take so long, but then the movie would be shorter and it is only 74 minutes anyway.For me there is a lot more fun to be had with ""The Killer Shrews,"" a 1959 movie that takes itself seriously despite having Miss Universe 1957, dogs dressed up in shag carpets, rubber heads with big teeth, and an escape plan that you have to see to believe.  The only question is why did ""MST3K"" wait until season four to take on this one?  This one has to be on my list of top ten bad monster movies.  Thorne Sherman (James Best) delivers supplies to an island just as a hurricane is coming.  He wants to wait out the story, but Dr. Milo Craigis (Baruch Lumet) wants Thorne to leave right away and take his daughter Ann (Ingrid Goude, Miss Sweden 1956 and then Miss Universe 1957), with him.  The Doctor sounds German while his daughter has a very interesting Swedish accent, but that is not the biggest mystery on the island.Dr. Craigis is concerned with over population and apparently his idea is was to shrink people to make food go farther.  To this end he experiments with the DNA of shrews who (a) grow to the size of dogs wearing shag carpeting, (b) have all of their worst traits becoming dominant, and (c) develop poison saliva.  You would think that any one of those three could cause problems when there are 300 shrews running around on an island, but no, all three happen.  The number of humans starts dwindling as the shrews need desert after eating all of the livestock on the island, so everybody starts drinking more (think about it: do you really want DRUNK giant vicious shrews with poison saliva?).  Jerry Farrell (Ken Curtis) decides that Ann sparking to Thorne is worse than having giant shrews attacking them, but soon sees the error of his ways and decides that going up on the roof would be a good idea.  That is also because he thinks that the idea that Thorne comes up with to escape to the boat is stupid, but I have to say, in terms of 1950s black & white monster movies this plan actually makes sense.Special mention must be made of Gordon McLendon who plays Dr. Radford Baines, the dedicated assistant to Dr. Craigis and who remains the consummate scientist even once he has been bitten.  His death sets up what is probably the funniest line of the movie until we get to the end where the last exchange of dialogue provides a pretty funny punch line to the entire experience of pure terror trying to get away from the giant vicious shrews with poison saliva.  There is just too much to enjoy in this movie, from listening to Goude's accent (you know it has to be Swedish but it does not sound Swedish and trying to figure out what it does sound like will drive you crazy), to watching the dogs covered in carpet frolick around the silly humans rolling on the ground, and waiting for one of the teeth on the rubber shrew heads to get caught on something and break off.  ""The Killer Shrews"" is my kind of bad movie.",The Giant Gila Monster / The Killer Shrews
577901,I loved Pay it Forward it was a great movie with excellent acting and a feel good story. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is simply this the movie is definitley able to keep my attention for most of the time. But there are a few parts in the movie that just become quite dull and dont really seem to have too big of an importance on the overall effect on the movie. Once again I think it's a good movie but just some parts are a little hard to get through. I think anyone who wants a nice feel good movie with a great meaning and a surprise sad ending should rent or buy this movie.,N/A

However, if you were a TV viewer in the early 1970's this collection will bring back lots of great memories of one of the best variety shows of the period. This was all before SNL began.

229098,"If I had it to do over, I'd give this movie five stars. It is hilarious. Yeah, the Coen brothers can have their dark, black comedy, bloody side (e.g., Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing and Fargo); but this film is from their light, witty, innocent side - and totally outrageous. These guys are masters at styling a film according to a certain time and place; and, in this case, the style is 1970's Arizona desert trailer park.The basic plot idea is that Cage and Hunter, who are married, can't have kids. But they read about a couple named Arizona that just had quintuplets, and figure, that's more kids than they can probably handle. So, they decide to kidnap one of the toddlers for themselves. Because Cage is an ex-con and Hunter a policewoman, this leads to some pretty bizarre situations. There are two classic scenes in particular. The first is the baby diaper chase sequence, which involves a gun-toting convenience store attendant, a package of Pampers, the police, a pack of rampaging dogs, a shooting spree in a grocery store, and a chase through people's homes. The second is the baby seat chase sequence, in which little Nathan Arizona, Jr., strapped pleasantly in his car seat, is up for grabs: first by negligent bank robbers, who unintentionally leave him sitting in the middle of the highway; then by a motor cycle babyhunter-from-hell, who snatches him up and rides off with him sitting on the front of his motorcycle; then by his adopted parents, Cage and Hunter. It ends in a showdown with the babyhunter-from-hell. Cohen humor is always outrageous and always hilarious.Like most Cohen brother films, Raising Arizona is full of outlandish characters that are well portrayed. Nicholas Cage is priceless as a Hawaiian shirt-wearing, hair-mussed bum, which he continued to play in other films, including Moonstruck (made that same year). Holly Hunter is fabulous as his tight-lipped, policewoman wife, later to play a similar role in O Brother Where Art Thou. John Goodman is consistent as one of two beer drinking, jail-bate ""friends,"" and played a one-eyed version of the same character in O Brother. There never has been a cuter little boy in film than T. J. Kuhn, who plays Nathan Arizona, Jr. And Trey Wilson is perfect as Nathan's dad - a wheeling, dealing, furniture store chain owner.Raising Arizona is the beginning of a trend of wild, quirky, hilarious films by the Cohens that has not let up, most notably O Brother Where Art Thou, Hudsucker Proxy and Fargo. You'll recognize the seeds of some of the characters and gags from those films in this one. Enjoy!Waitsel Smith",Raising Arizona VHS

198176,"First I must take gentle exception to the post below stating that there were no widescreen (anamorphic) movies in the US prior to 1955.  Uh-uhh!  Fox imported a French anamorphic system, christened it CinemaScope, and used it beginning in 1953 (How to Marry a Millionaire and the Robe, for example).  By 1954 'scope was spreading to other studios, as witness MGM's Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Brigadoon.  OK, the transfer onto DVD of THE GLENN MILLER STORY is a little flat--but blame that on the production standards of 1954, when Technicolor and the other colors were still quite picky--often to the point where cinematographer and director had to use compromise lenses to make sure the film wasn't underexposed.That having been said, and all technical stuff aside, THE GLENN MILLER STORY is a fine movie.  Jimmy Stewart brings his patented aw-shucks manner to a bandleader who was firmly in control of himself and knew what he wanted--to the point of proposing to his belle if that isn't too elevated a word--after they had had only one real date!  June Allyson is charming and fun and the film, especially in the last reel, gives her the chance to dig in and act.  While Allyson wasn't the most talented dancer out of MGM, and her breath control when singing was a sometimes thing, she remains beguiling, a fully fleshed-out figure well beyond ""cute"" or ""fresh.""The film covers the period from the early depression until the waning days of World War II.  Glenn Miller's rise as a player, later bandleader, even later composer/arrangement, was not swift.  I think of this as a kind of ""rags to rags to riches story,"" of the kind that were so sadly numerous during the 1930s.My only real gripe about this tuneful and well-crafted film is that it has a bad case of Eureka-itis.  I mean, the songs that the fictional Glenn would be writing in the future are telegraphed to us, the audience, way ahead of time and usually not subtly, either.  (The first scene in the movie has Stewart in an L.A. pawn shop enquiring about the cost of a string of pearls; later on he complains that the really hot swing is worth playing only when people are in the mood.  That sort of thing.)Nonetheless, at this low price I think most people will be happy to overlook the occasional bits of staginess and enjoy this musical biopic for what it is.  By the way, the music for the movie was re-recorded by the postwar incarnation of Miller's band, and not only is the playing excellent the sound reproduction is not bad considering the film's Fifties origin.",N/A
396316,"All right, let's get this out of the way first: This film is thoroughly racist and D. W. Griffith's politics are utterly disgusting.Griffith was one of the most important innovators in cinema, inventing much of the basic grammar of film. It is impossible to underestimate his technical contributions. Birth of a Nation is his most famous--or rather, infamous--film. It's the first blockbuster in movie history, and it made Griffith a very rich man. It dragged cinema out of the age of the two-reeler and showed the studios that there was a huge market for long films and historical epics. It also inspired (if that's the right word) the revival of the Ku Klux Klan and taught millions of white Americans to hate and fear blacks.But, now that all of Griffith's technical innovations have become utterly commonplace (so commonplace, in fact, that even the most amateurish filmmakers use them without thinking), what's left in Birth of a Nation to enjoy and admire? Well, not much, I'm afraid. Lacking the distinct visionary style of the best silent-era filmmakers (Chaplin, Lang, Stroheim, Murnau, Dreyer, etc.), Griffith's work falls flat. There's nothing here to enchant the eye or exercise the mind, which forces one to concentrate entirely on the content. And what paltry content it is. False, ludicrous melodrama and grimacing, hand-waving performances straight out of some 19th-century traveling stock company's production of East Lynne. Cheesy-looking battle re-enactments. The hoariest old cliches unredeemed by any wit or beauty or intelligence.Judged purely on its artistic merits, Birth of a Nation really rates only one star; but since it occupies an important place in film history, I reluctantly give it two stars. Film geeks should watch it once, just to see how far we've advanced--morally, politically, and cinematically--since Griffith's day.",N/A
604667,"You've got to be kidding me! I watched this movie already 4-5 times since I bought it, and still it brings to life the real reason for not cloning, that clones will always think that it is just an mere echo of the real person. No matter what excuse it gives, like being raised in the mines and learning real hate dished out by Romulans, and any other excuse, the real reason is that clones will always think of theirselves as mere shadows, unable to live up to the real person. We aspire to better ourselves, but that can not be reasoned by a clone. It is not real, it is just an echo. On the heels of Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan, this movie stands as the best of the Next Generation movies made. That right! When you think about how the Romulans are willing to act, when you think that you are going to be one to make diplomatic contact and be friends, when you find a foe that rather end everything else, instead of himself (as a clone) you as the Captain Picard are just presented with one of the weirdest battles a person would ever face. See yourself, and the other side of you, as presented by your clone. And as the real person, at all costs to normality, you can not let it happen, personally to the point of giving your own life to leave others to live, except for a robot, that aspires to be human, but can not, and sees himself with a B4 model, that drives it also drives this movie as a total experience. Unlike a human, a robot can sacrify his life, he is just a mere robot, and in the end, becomes more human just by that act, but will not realize it. The depth of this film demands full attention, as to all the details, such as the strife within the Romulans with some wanting peace and some willing to do anything for war and to win.

807041,"Like other reviewers here, I have strong memories of Patrick McGoohan's Scarecrow. In fact, it made more impact on me than any other episode in many years of childhood viewing of Disney's Sunday night Worlds.  So why has Disney elected to cancel this DVD release without explanation?  Disney must be well aware of the fan interest.  Have they still concluded there is no market?  Are there technical or legal issues?  Are they holding it because of some future project? Check the disneyvideos website and you will see the title does not appear in their release calendar, which currently lists titles to November 2005.  You can, however, if you search their site for Dr. Syn, register your interest in seeing Scarecrow released.  You will also find mailing addresses for Disney and BV Home Entertainment where you could make your case in writing.Update:  I see Tom Hering's Scarecrow of Romney Marsh website is now citing insider information that Disney may be trying to restore and remaster the original full length TV version but has been hampered by loss of some of the original negative elements.

491553,"This movie really amazed me.  It showed me how funny movies could be, even 70 years ago.  In fact, I can't remember a movie this funny being shown in any theater in recent times.  There probably hasn't been something this funny in theaters for at least six years.Groucho is top notch in this one.  Although he's known for making joke after joke after joke in a very short amount of time, he puts tons of top quality jokes into his performance here.  After publicly thanking Mrs. Claypool for financing the opera, he tells the audience that he's sure the memories of a great performer will come back to them, just as sure as Mrs. Claypool's checks will come back in the morning.Chico has a great scene in this film too.  He tells a phoney story about flying across the Atlantic.  He says that after two attempts, the plane ran out of gas, and on the third attempt, his crew got about halfway across the ocean and then realized they forgot the airplane.The Marx Brothers somehow manage to get the opera's orchestra to play ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"" which forces them to succumb to the irresistable temptation of yelling out ""Peanuts, Popcorn.""  They ruin the opera in several other ways as well, like dropping random backgrounds behind the actors while they are singing, with Harpo tearing up one of backgrounds too.One of the best scenes is when they stow away in a boat, and end up in a very small room.  As if it weren't cramped enough, visitor after visitor arrives, and soon 20 more people shove their way in there.  It gets so crowded a sleeping Harpo is pushed onto a woman, and while he's lying on her, Groucho says to Chico something along the lines of, ""Hey, when I said work fast, I didn't mean your friend, I meant the maid.""Groucho's deadbeat-type character never gets old.  He tries to give his hotel bill away, and he withdraws a healthy salary without doing anything.  When he's fired, he demands he gets his two-weeks salary pay.  When informed that he's overdrawn his salary for the next six months, he says he'll take one week's salary instead.Highly recommended.  This movie will get you to really appreciate the genious of the Marx Brothers.",A Night at the Opera VHS
942209,"'March of the Penguins' goes to show how truly a remarkable world that we live in. It's fascinating to say the least. Observing the penguins on their long and arduous journey across the harshest realm on the planet is nothing short of phenomenal not to mention inspiring. To see the dedication, the love and compassion that these animals are capable of, and the long period of time that they've continued this biologial imperative for survival is epic in proportions.One cannot help but admire these quirky yet majestic creatures. Trust me when I say they didn't get the name 'Emperor Penguins' for nothing because they truly are worthy of worship given the gargantuan tasks that they undertake and see through to completion. We learn many impressive facts about these penguins, such as they can dive to 1700 feet in sub-zero waters and remain under water up to 20 minutes at a time. Their natural grace in the water is poetry in motion, truly awe-inspiring as they seem to fly through the antarctic fluid effortlessly.Another intriguing fact is that these penguins remain monogomous for one year at a time, and are wholly devoted to their offspring to the point where they risk their lives for them, and sadly but surely often end up making the ultimate sacrifice. After the mother has nested on the egg until it hatches, the father takes over the nurturing, shielding it under its feathered flesh while the mother goes off to gather food for the little one. It's quite moving to see what great length these wonderful creatures go to in order to ensure the survival of their spawn.Perhaps the most memorable and beautiful moment of the entire film was the mating ritual and brief moments of tenderness between the male and female in which they wooed each other, stroking and caressing their beaks up and down their bodies, ending up with what might equal what we know as a kiss. Such a warm embrace in the coldest, most barren and unforgiving landscape on the planet was nothing short of miraculous. I mean who would expect to find such love in this most remote of regions?The trials they endured, the sacrifices they made, it was all worth it, and of course most of it is the biological need to procreate and perpetuate the longevity of the species, but the film succeeded in portraying that special something that exists within the animal kingdom that science cannot scoop up and study under a microscope. That undefinable, immeasurable and all-conquering thing is love, ladies and gentlemen, and I think we could all learn alot from these lovable, fuzzy little creatures that don't appear to have a mean bone in their tiny bodies.If you've seen animal documentaries on TV and enjoyed them, chances are you'll fall for this film, at the very least feel somewhat enriched by the experience it shares with the people lucky enough to witness their gift to the world. My hat goes off to the French film crew and scientists who helped bring about this wondrous adventure.",N/A

I've seen the original and yes this version does miss the mark on many counts.  That said, one can divorce this film from the original version and still find much to admire.  Now this is not going to go down as one of the Coen brothers landmark achievements, but it's not ""Barton Fink"" either.  The brothers seem to be coasting here.

Here it seems more like a collage of scenes that got linked together to form the film.I never felt that Tommy Powers was a real Public Enemy like the Dillingers or the Little Ceasers . He was more or less a Kid from the slums who made it big by joining up with the more veteran criminals. He never really ran a gang and was basically just trying to make some money being muscle for the boss, he didnt  seem to have any ambition other then money and taking care of his mother.The tension between him and his angelic brother was not as developed or fleshed out as it could have been which might have been interesting as a subplot including his brothers seeming manic depression upon his return from the battlefield of WW1.What makes this film worth a thorough view is the countless innuendos that pass between Cagney and those dames he falls for.One evening his bosses girl starts to get frisky touchy kissey feeley with him and in more words then not came just short of saying lets  f.....The Next morning.

914165,"See this movie.  Please!  Don't worry about the English subtitles, there really is not that much dialogue in the film and when Shultze does get to America, well, the Americans speak English.  The images tell the story of this film even more than the words.  Plus, there is an effect of not even noticing the subtitles after a couple of minutes.This is a film about a seemingly-stolid block of man named Schultze.  He is forced into early retirement from his job in the salt mines with a couple of his buddies.  Since all they know is the pit, they don't handle retirement all that well.  The images of the film are absolutely wonderful in showing us the deadening symmetry and regularity of their lives.  One I can't help sharing with you is the cheap lamp made of rock salt they are given as their retirement gift.They are also members of an amateur music society that is coming up on its fiftieth birthday.  Schultze, like his father before him, is an accordion player, and every year he plays a polka in their presentation.  However, he happens upon a radio station playing Zydeco music.  This ends up changing Schultze's life forever and sets this unadventurous man on a hero's journey whose details I cannot share with you.  You must see all of them for yourself.  Each of the great images in this film could fill pages and pages of explanation because they are so richly conceived and yet shot with such minimal action or dialogue.The ending of the movie left me a bit unsatisfied, but I can understand the hero's fate after he sacrifices everything to reach his final destination.  However, being a musician myself, I know how much he and the other musicians would have enjoyed themselves more if a more outgoing approach had been taken - you don't need English to get other musicians to understand that you like their music and want to play with them.However, that is a quibble.  And it is wonderful how Schultze's grand adventure and his hometown buddies' misunderstanding of and projection onto the hero's adventure leads to changes in what is acceptable and what is also desirable even if symmetrical respectability still holds them in thrall.",N/A

394397,"""The King of Comedy"" is the complementary ""bookend"" of another Scorsese masterpiece, ""Taxi Driver"", with Robert DeNiro playing asocial, near-psychotic fame-obsessed characters in both. Both films play strongly against audience expectation -- ""King"" even more than ""Taxi"".In ""The King of Comedy"", DeNiro's character, Rupert Pupkin -- a seemingly untalented standup-comic wannabe -- is played for very black non-laughs. Rupert is so cut off from normal social interaction that he's unable to make any progress towards becoming the great stand-up comic he knows he's destined to be. When an encounter with his late-night idol Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) finally opens the possibility of appearing on television, he completely blows the chance, throwing him into the anguish that provokes increasingly demented assaults on his idol.On your first viewing -- and likely your third and tenth -- you'll be so violently embarrassed by Pupkin's self-destructive behavior that your toes will spastically curl down -- and stay there. You'll squirm so much you'll think you've mutated into a graboid. Rumor has it the actors _themselves_ were so embarrassed that scenes which should have taken hours to film took _days_.This acute discomfort explains the film's box-office failure (not to mention its ""sitting in the can"" for nearly two years) -- the average viewer isn't interested in a protagonist devoid of any sympathetic or redeeming characteristics -- until the end.The ending wholly upsets our expectations. Though we've been lead to believe Rupert lacks any mirth-provoking skills, he shows himself quite able to get an audience to laugh. His routine might not be brilliant, but he's no less funny than most comedians guesting on late-night talk shows.Significantly, Pupkin's routine isn't a series of jokes, but a more or less literal recitation of his miserable childhood. What the audience finds funny is actually Rupert's personal tragedy. We finally begin to understand why he's so screwed up. (I disagree with Roger Ebert that the film has no ""payoff"" and the ending is ""cynical and unsatisfying"".)Tthough ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" are fundamentally similar, the latter inverts two important elements of the former...>> Despite its gritty look, ""Taxi Driver"" is fundamentally romantic, while ""King of Comedy"" treats the material in a semi-documentary style. Scorsese never ""tells"" us how we're supposed to react to the characters.>> We're initially annoyed (to say the least!) by Rupert Pupkin, then ultimately sympathize with him. Travis Bickle is at first the sympathetic loner, until we realize he's a psycho -- underscored (pun intended) by Bernard Herrmann's re-use of the three-note ""mad house"" theme at the end.Which brings us to the films' use of music. The ""Taxi Driver"" score came from the greatest film composer yet to have set pen to paper, while ""King of Comedy"" has _no_ score. Why?Bernard Herrmann felt music was needed to make the emotional connection between the screen and the audience. This ain't necessarily so -- you can fully convey the most-profound emotions in a scoreless film (eg, ""The Execution of Private Slovick"").Music's ability to enhance emotion is _so_ strong it can override the director's intentions. This is probably why Hitchcock initially told Herrmann _not_ to score Janet Leigh's shower. Without music, the scene is indescribably brutal. With Herrmann's music, its Expressionistic elements are raised to the Nth power. Is it any wonder Hitchcock was thrilled and let the music stand?Scorsese must have recognized this, and realized that any musical ""comment"" on Rupert Pupkin's behavior would only soften and sentimentalize the audience's reaction to him. When Pupkin makes an utter fool of himself, the audience has to experience it directly -- gurgling bassoons can't be telling the viewer they're not supposed to take it seriously. Similarly, when we finally begin to understand Rupert at the end, Scorsese doesn't want to sentimentalize the moment.If you have any lingering doubts about seeing ""The King of Comedy"", there's _one_ thing in it (ignoring even DeNiro's incredibly perfect ""should have won an Oscar"" performance -- he _is_ Rupert Pupkin) that fully justifies a view: After kidnapping Langford, Pupkin and Masha tie him to a chair, then duct-tape his mouth.The sight of ""Mr. Greasy-Hair No-Talent"" himself, Jerry Lewis, with his mouth taped shut (Oh, joy! Oh, rapture!), is worth the price of admission, many, many times over. If all Martin Scorsese's work were destroyed, excpet for this one scene, it would be enough to sanctify his work as a movie maker. I grovel at Scorsese's feet, for (at least symbolically) putting the French toast of intellectuals in his place. It's doubly pleasing, because Lewis's turn as Langford is, consciously or not, strinkingly self-satirizing.If you have Microsoft Cinemania, look up the Ebert and Kael reviews. Ebert's shows why he is one of the finest critics around -- whether or not you agree with him, you come away with a better understanding of a film. (It's also worthwhile reading Ebert's review of ""Taxi Driver"" to see how much of what he says about that film can be applied to ""The King of Comedy."") Kael's review shows that the only insight she has into anything is her own self-serving attitude. There was never a ""serious"" movie critic who brought _less_ -- intellectually or emotionally -- to the reviewing process than Pauline Kael (qv, her review of ""2001"").Is ""The King of Comedy"" a truly great film? I don't know. But it _is_ a terrific piece of totally uncompromising film making. Anyone who claims to love movies should see it.",The King of Comedy VHS

494343,"LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE is a genuinely-terrifying entry into the `haunted house' genre, based on the book ""Hell House"" by Richard Matheson.  The shocks and surprises are brilliantly-executed and just as harrowing for the audience as they are for the on-screen victims.Barrett (Clive Revill) leads an expedition into the infamous `Hell House', the mission being to complete a total spiritual cleansing of the area.  He's joined by his wife Ann (Gayle Hunnicutt), young and idealistic medium Florence Tanner (Pamela Franklin) and Ben Fischer (Roddy McDowall), who took part in the previous attempt to exorcise the house 15 years ago and was the sole member to emerge unscathed.Slowly but surely, the effects of the house and the unspeakable horrors that ocurred within it's walls succeed in turning the members of the team against one another.  Outstanding acting from all concerned but the big standout is Pamela Franklin (who could win a Nicola Pagett look-alike contest) and lights up the screen in her performance as the sincere young medium who is deceived into aiding the wrong side.  Gayle Hunnicutt makes the most out of the least-developed and passive character in the piece, who becomes a raving nymphomanic in one of the most memorable scenes.  Roddy McDowall is amazing as the world-weary Ben, and Clive Revill brings a good dose of sensibility to Barrett.  The DVD is presented in a crisp 16:9 print.  Colours are very rich and black levels are good and deep.  The ahead-of-its-time electronic score is provided by Brian Hodgson and Delia Derbyshire.

371305,"piece of war propaganda that came closer than many think to what women nurses went through in the Pacific. The majority of the actors are excellent, the script is a little corny but still captures your attention (once you begin watching, no way you don't keep watching), and the scenery, while sound-stagish, is more than effective enough to help the film make its point. Anti-Japanese? Today, perhaps, but not at all (and actually kinda mild) for the time. If you were in a supposed battle-free hospital zone suddenly being reduced to rubble by  bombers with your friends among some of the dead, you might be inclined to cast some aspersions on the nationality of the army dropping the bombs, too... The veiled reference to Nanking was also interesting. Yeah, it starts getting a little treacly toward the end, but it's 1943 Hollywood. Same-era war films rarely get better than this.

755823,"This DVD is a faithful screen adaptation of the book ""Gods and Generals"", by Jeffrey Shaara.  It deals with the very beginnings of the American Civil War and progresses through the battle of Chancellorsville.  The book (and movie) are part of a three-part trilogy on the Civil War.  The movie is produced by Ted Turner, who makes a small cameo appearance as a southern soldier. This movie is a prequel to the 1993 hit ""Gettysburg"".The movie (like the book) centers on the major generals of the war, Robert E. Lee (played to a ""tee"" by Robert Duvall), General ""Stonewall"" Jackson (excellently played by Stephan Lang), and the union's Lt. Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (played by the very capable Jeff Daniels).  Of course, the leadership on each side believes in and prays to a God that they hope will deliver them victorious, thus the title ""Gods and Generals"".While the movie has sweeping visuals and equisitely accurate battle sceens, the movie is simply too long at nearly 4 hours in length.  Proper editing would have resulted in a more enjoyable film.  Too much time is allowed for elegant proseic speeches by the generals, generally to their wives.  The movie really bogs down in these sections and one is tempted to fast forward past them to the action that lies ahead.The actors do a remarkable job; all are believable and truly become the character(s) they portray.  The battle scenes are the film's strength and are an eye-opener for anyone not familiar with the bloody brutality of the Civil War, our nation's bloodiest conflict.  The courage of the soldiers facing an 800-yard march across an open field being pounded by cannon fire is something to behold.  The historical accuracy of the film is also a draw, as it teaches Civil War history.I believe the average viewer will tire of this movie due to its excessive length.  However, the Civil War buff will revel in the great detail and the effort to make the film historically accurate.  The film is appropriate for all but the youngest members of the family, as some of the killing is graphic.  I doubt that children will be able to watch the film to its conclusion, as they will lose interest in the non-battle scenes.With proper editing, this could have been a 4 or 5-star movie.  The best I can give it is a 3-star rating due to its length.Jim Konedog Koenig",N/A

If you are in shape at all, this may be a bit too light for you.  Also, this doesn't really teach you bellydance moves so don't buy this DVD for that reason.  It really is just a fun little workout with a bit of bellydance flavor (some hip and chest moves) that will get a beginner sweating.  It does take a few runs through the routine to get the moves and steps down, but before long you'll be way ahead of the voice cues!  I would just stress two things: keep your abs tight throughout the entire workout and if your arms get tired (they will!) just lower them a bit and keep moving.  I think this is definitely worthwhile for the beginner.  Just don't take it too seriously and have some fun!

849207,"This is the best film I've seen in perhaps six months or more.  The direction by Turkish/Italian director Ferzan Ozpetek is consistently interesting, intriguing, beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually.  The film is beautifully cut, and the acting, particularly by the fascinating Giovanna Mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also Giovanna, is first rate.The story begins in a bakery during World War II when Davide Veroli (Massimo Girotti) is a baker's apprentice.  We see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the cave-like establishment.  But he is pounced upon by the baker.  They wrestle, a knife is grabbed and apparently the baker falls and there is blood on Davide's hands as he runs out into the streets.Cut to modern times as Giovanna and her working-class husband, Filippo (Filippo Nigro) are crossing a bridge in the city.  They meet an old man who seems lost and disoriented.  He can't remember his name and he has no identification.  Filippo takes pity on him and against his wife's wishes takes him home with them to their apartment.  We know because of the man's age that the mystery of who he is has something to do with the men in the bakery scene from World War II.But his story is only tangential to the central story of the film which is about Giovanna's brief affair with the man next door, Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), whose apartment window faces hers.  This is a love story, a bitter-sweet one--which all great love stories should be in some sense, since life itself is bittersweet.  It is framed by, and contrasted with, another love story, that involving the older man from many years ago.The tension in the film revolves around the resolution of the affair between the married Giovanna and the handsome man who will soon be leaving the city.  Will she abandon her marriage and her family for the excitement of a new man?  Because the police can find out nothing about the old man, and because Giovanna's heart softens toward him, and because he is an elegant man of refinement, especially in the pastry arts--Giovanna's dream is to be a pastry chef--the man is allowed to stay for a while and the two are drawn together into friendship, the old man and the young woman.That's enough of the plot--the development, the denouement, and the resolution of which are beautifully realized in both an artistic and an emotional sense.  Instead let me say that the feel of modern Italy with its racial tensions and its old world versus new world differences are nicely expressed as the past makes itself felt on the present.  The dialogue is wonderfully expressive and gives us the sense of authenticity and the kind of realistic effect seen only in the very best films.  This is the first film directed by Ozpetek that I have seen, but it won't be the last.But see this for Giovanna Mezzogiorno whose beautiful and expressive eyes and natural demeanor will hold you to the screen.",Facing Windows

I don't think he is a bad actor, but I don't see him as a breakout actor for his acting abilities. He is quite good in this movie though as the arrogant sports-to-go-to man for gambling tips. Jeremy Piven, though in a small role, is very similar to his character on Entourage, but you know, he's great as that character as he is in this one. Al Pacino is always good. Acutally, he's great in this movie. The only problem is that his character is very conventional Pacino. Always yelling, yelling, yelling, getting mad, being scary. But, Pacino is good at that. Though Pacino is presenting nothing new here, he is very good at presenting nothing new. My favorite though is Rene Russo. She really suprised me with her performance.

577007,"This is a tough, hard movie about a retired safe cracker who is recruited for one last job. It also is funny and uncomfortable in equal measure, with excellent performances by Ray Winstone as the cracksman and Ian McShane as the man behind the job. Most of all, it has a mesmerizing and powerful performance by Ben Kingsley as Don Logan, all barely bottled resentment and anger as the muscle sent to recruit the Winstone character for the job.Gal Dove (Winstone) has retired from crime and now lives in a villa on the coast of Spain with his wife, who has also retired, in her case from the porn business. They're easy going working class people who just want to bake in the sun and swim in their pool. One morning while Gal is sunning himself, listening to music, a huge boulder shakes loose from the hill above him and comes rolling down toward him. He doesn't see it and doesn't hear it. It barely misses his head and crashes into the pool.A little later he learns that Teddy Bass (McShane) is sending Logan from London with an offer to buy into one last safe-cracking caper. Logan is more dangerous and lethal than the boulder would ever be. Logan sees everything as a possible affront or a deliberate insult. He's got half a screw loose. He can work himself into a rage in an instant. Just having a drink with him is nerve wracking. When Gal declines the offer, Logan's temperature rapidly starts going up. At one point, late at night while Gal and his wife are sound asleep, Logan wakes up to take a leak in his bathroom. He stands in front of the toilet, starts urinating and quickly talks himself into a rage. He deliberately moves so that he's peeing onto the floor. Then he charges into Gal's bedroom, wakes them up and is almost incoherent with what he seees as the insult of being turned down. It's sort of funny, but frightening. Kingsley gives one of the performances of his life. He is screwed so tight anything can set him off. His Don Logan is muscular, staring, almost rigid at times.Gal quickly sees that he must join the gang in London or there is no predicting what Logan would do to him...or to his wife and their two friends. The rest of the movie is basically the underwater break-in from a pool in a turkish bath to the vaults of the next door bank. Logan is dealt with satisfyingly, but only after it looks like he will kill a young pool boy at Gal's villa. Gal gets back to Spain by the skin of his teeth, because Bass may suspect what happened to Logan but he really doesn't care.Ray Winstone does a great job as the retired safe cracker. All he wants is peace and quiet and to enjoy the fruits of his labor with his wife and his friends. He's just a working class guy who does what he must, but who is a little shrewder than many would give him credit for. Ian McShane, on the other hand, does just as good a job, but his character is absolutely ruthless. He can be charming, with a smile that seems genuine. But the eyes are dead. You wouldn't want to cross him. He could turn Tony Soprano into hash.This is a satisfyingly brutal, funny and ironic movie. The DVD transfer is first rate.",N/A

The problems that she faced trying to keep her friends from finding out about her and her friends from Halloweentown were hilarious. Marnie's powers are tremendously more advanced in Halloweentown High than they were in the other two movies, though her spells don't always have the desired effect most of the time.

A skeleton is attacking someone and Marnie tries the spell that her grandmother uses to make something go away but ends up only making the skeleton several times larger. There were only two things that I didn't like about the movie. One, there was no commentary track by the cast, and two, the audio is 5.1 surround sound. If you don't have a surround sound system, the sound will be compressed which can make the volume get a bit softer in places. I don't have a 5.1 system yet, but I'm hoping.

Wheeeeeeee!The only things left in the wake of this horror (apart from a flood-tide of blood) are body-parts and a designer shoe-bag, so the police forensic team needs a strainer and plastic baggies to haul the evidence back to the Station.Now that's what some might call a promising start---I certainly do!---but trust me, it's *nothing* compared to the unbridled tsunami of ghoulish creepiness and pure unadulterated ick that flows once this baby gets rolling.The party is just getting started: as news of the atrocity on the subway platform filters out through TV and radio, the nation is gripped by a wave of copycat suicides among a wide range of people with no obvious connections. And what is the connection between the spate of suicides and the mind-rippingly awful girl-group ""Desert"" (or Dessert/Desart---the group name inexplicably changes)? Or the link to a website that is evidently tracking the suicides---*before* they occur?When I first watched the film, I had unwittingly rented the R-rated Blockbuster DVD, which trims the opening bloodbath down to about 10 seconds of ruddy splashing. I soon realized my mistake, but it wasn't the opener that sent me running out of the house to buy my own copy: it's the breathtaking second sequence.All I'll tell you is that most of the action in this sequence is filmed in almost unbearably long tracking shots of nurses navigating their way through the dark corridors of a nearly empty hospital. The sequence works---it's very subtle and you are convinced there are things happening just out of range of the camera that Sono is teasing you with---the director doesn't want you to see everything, not yet. That sequence alone was so cripplingly spooky that I rushed out and bought myself an unrated copy.To be honest, when the credits rolled I contemplated returning the thing, perhaps saying it was defective. Having watched the movie in its entirety, I was baffled, confused, frustrated and annoyed. I was quite taken by the visual bravado with which Sono and his trusty DP Kazuto Sato shot the film: it goes in a heartbeat from creepy crawly ick to techno garish and back again. So what was wrong?Certainly not the acting, which is all competent, surprising given the number of younger actors, and even though we obviously lose something in translation. The great Ryo Ishibashi squints and grumbles his way through another cop role (he also starred as the Police Inspector in the American remake of ""The Grudge"" and played against type as a film producer in Miike's ""Audition"").Best of all, Sono ratchets up the level of grue and inexplicable vileness: the autopsy sequence calls to mind ""The Thing"", and rest assured you'll never look at a tuna roll in the same way again.I think my problem with ""Suicide Circle"" is the film's abrupt shift, possibly psychotic shift in tone about 40 minutes in. Initially, I hated this mystifying claptraption; I felt cheated for having bought it---when on Earth, and why, would I ever watch the wretched thing again? If you feel that way after your first viewing, relax---that's normal.But I've changed my mind. I still hate ""Suicide Circle"", but I'm now convinced that it's a work of diabolical brilliance, and I suspect that Shion Sono has created a kind of cursed masterpiece, a work of viral cinema that infects the mind of the viewer and insidiously replicates long after the credits roll. I say this because, quite frankly, I can't get the infernal thing out of my head, and the more I think about it, the more mesmerized I am by this gory-beautiful little puzzle-box of horrors.""Suicide Club"" is compulsively unforgettable and intellectually voracious: this is a film that positively squirms, teems, and writhes with ideas.I can't stop thinking about it. I made the mistake of looking, now I'm forced to watch, even when I close my eyes.JSG",Suicide Club

759702,"Although the reputation of Outer limits rests on Joseph Stephano and the first season, the fact is many (and I mean MANY!) season one stories were more interesting than entertaining, with good ideas but not fully realised as scripts. Episodes like O.B.I.T and The Production and Decay of Strange Particles regularly bored me to the point of curing insomnia, as they were really a half hour plot padded with merciless, banal chatter to the length of an hour.The second season boasts a team of writers such as Harlan Ellison, Jerry Sohl, Ib Melchior and Seeleg Lester, not to mention stories adapted from the likes of Clifford D Simak, and frankly, they're better! They seem to be fully realised science ficiton stories, rather than a quirky or interesting idea which is being dragged out to painful lengths.The Soldier, which inspired The Terminator, is a stunner, thanks to a great plot and a superb performance from Michael Ansara. Demon with a Glass Hand is Ellison's masterpiece and Robert Culp delivers a great performance, in perhaps the best ever Outer Limits ep.Counterweight is an interesting idea about a space flight simulator testing the first crew of regular people and an alien intelligence which awakens their fears and obsessions.The Premonition, which surely inspired the classic ""Timelash"" episode of Gerry Anderson's UFO series, is a gripping time-freeze tale about a test pilot trying to save his little girl from impending death.Wolf 359 is eerie and strange and a little too opaque, with a creature whose motives are never explained, but the central concept is quite good.I, Robot is effective, Cold Hand, Warm Heart is not bad and they boast Kirk and Spock themselves, Shatner and Nimoy. The Inheritors features Robert Duvall and The Invisible Enemy is an involving space adventure despite the lead role in the questionable hands of Adam West, who actually does quite okay in the part.So, while it lacks the way out monsters of season one, (which have dated badly anyway) and the stylised camera work and music, season two is actually in the hands of writers who are in many ways, more engaging story-tellers than the legendary Joseph Stefano. It's probably sacrelige to say it, but the second season is actually better than the first and it's a tragedy that stupid scheduling killed it.","The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 2"

405097,"The title itself of the Wayans Brother's 1996 parody, Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, comically implies to several different films concerning African-American males coming of age in socially troubling environments.  Some of the titles that come to mind are Boyz n the Hood (1991), Juice (1992), and Menace II Society (1993) among many others.  Even though many of these films possess a high cinematic value, the Wayans recognize an excess of these types of films, as they provide a parody portrayal of the difficulties young African-American males face while growing up in rough neighborhoods throughout the United States.  Guiltlessly the Wayans approach this theme with ruthless abandon while applying their traditional spoofing spin on it, which unquestionably will cause both irritation and amusement.The story follows a similar path of Boyz n the Hood from which the audience will recognize the name Tr&eacute;.  Here the name has mutated into Ashtray, and is performed by Shawn Wayans.  The film opens with a picturesque aerial shot of the neighborhood where a stop sign is one of the first things that attracts the audience's attention, which states, ""I wouldn't stop if I was you.""  It is a brief display of impending parody and the comic tone that will heavily play with stereotypes and prejudices, but it also hints of the merciless assault of satire that the Wayans will deliver in this film.Ashtray's mother drops him off at his father's place while she states, ""You know there ain't no positive black females in these movies.""  Ashtray is supposed to learn how to become a man from his father.  Hilariously the audience will discover that Ashtray's father is younger than him, and this immature character could not possibly teach Ashtray any character qualities such as responsibility and loyalty.  Instead, the father informs him not to smoke or drink his stuff while also letting him spend bedtime with the women he brings home.  Despite the crazy humor, the Wayans produce serious undercurrents that deal with racial issues, stereotypes across ethnic groups, and gender issues.The social importance of friendships is seen through Ashtray's cousin Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) whose identity is more or less ripped off from O-Dog in Menace II Society.  The parody does not take any hostages in this film, as it fools around with the idea of being in bad company.  Together Loc Dog and Ashtray continue to display the daily struggles of living in the `hood.  There are moments when the film presents high quality parody to scenes where the comedy sinks to the level of a third grader's poop humor.  Nevertheless, Don't Be a Menace touches a part of the American tapestry with brutal honesty, as this spoof could also serve as a social criticism.  The scene where they play Po'Nopoly, a Monopoly spoof, highlights some of the dismal situations where society limits the African-Americans.Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood might suggest to some that there have been too many films about struggling young African-American males.  Maybe the parody is on society, as several films have to be made, yet no significant changes have been made to help promote a better situation for African-Americans.  The Wayans recognize the problem and through this parody deliver a message that something has to be done so people do not need to say, ""Man, I need to get out of this place.""",Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood VHS
109009,"Agatha Christie has enjoyed a long period of popularity with Filmmakers with her novels always proving popular sources for some very entertaining films. When one's mind conjures up memories of the classic ""Murder on the Orient Express"", or ""Death on the Nile"", as great film adaptations of her novels, ""Murder with Mirrors"", can be seen as possibly one of the more minor made-for-television film efforts to come from one of her works. Despite this minor status and a not totally exciting mystery story this effort has been given an ""A"", treatment in every department with beautiful settings, a first rate cast of both English and American actors, and enough whodunnit mystery included to keep most Agatha Christie lovers satisfied.  The teaming of Hollywood veterans Helen Hayes and Bette Davis is the film's main focus point and despite the well known tension between the two during filming, they team well here despite Davis being very frail and ravaged looking due to the chronic health problems she encountered just prior to filming. She is sadly a shadow of her former dramatic self however her presense here is still very central to the main action.  Christie purists may object to Helen Hayes taking on this very English role perhaps immortalised best by Joan Hickson however she brings her usual likeable personality to the character that is most enjoyable.The story opens as we see Jane Marple (Helen Hayes), being called by the stepson (John Woodvine), of her old friend Carrie Louise Serrocold (Bette Davis). Christian is very concerned about her welfare and asks Miss Marple to pay her a visit at her country estate, Stonygate. Bewilderd by what is actually wrong Miss Marple travels down to visit her friend where she is introduced to the many colourful characters in Carrie Louise's family. Chief among them are Carrie Louise's adoring new husband Lewis Serrocold (John Mills), her bitter widowed daughter Mildred (Dorothy Tutin), and her granddaughter Gina (Liane Langand). Each of these family members seems to have their own problems with Gina involved in a complicated romantic triangle involving her American husband Wally (John Laughlin), and flashy Englishman Steven Restarick (James Coombes). Christian also arrives and it is revealed to Jane that it is feared that someone is trying to slowly poison Carrie Louise. The pressing question is of course who is responsible and when and where are they going to strike. Jane has a real mystery on her hands as it seems most of the family have some kind of a motive. Could it be Carrie Louise's overly efficient nurse Miss Bellaver (Franced de La Tour), who seems strangely preoccupied with her medication? Or is it Gina's gun happy disgruntled husband, or indeed the strange young man who works on the estate (Tim Roth), who claims Lewis is his real father. Indeed it could also be just as easily Carrie Louise's neglected daughter? Soon after arriving Christian is found mysteriously murdered and Scotland Yard in the form of gruff Inspector Curry (Leo McKern), is called in to investigate. Locking horns with the busy body Jane Marple the two form an unlikely alliance in order to track down the killer together. As their investigation deepens tradegy strikes when Edgar is drowned and Jane also finds her own life endangered as twice her life is put in danger and many red herrings seem to be thrown into her path to head her off from finding the real killer. However Jane's reputation as an excellent amateur sleuth was not earned lightly and in the final round up of all the likely suspects Jane manages to pick out the highly unlikely real murderer neatly wrapping up the case under the frustrated eyes of the inspector who had hoped to solve it himself.Despite ""Murder With Mirrors"", being considered a minor work by the queen of murder mystery writing, the main objections raised against the film is the up dating of the story to a 1980's setting and the strange mixture of nationalities in the main cast all playing British. Indeed it is easy to almost forget that this is an Agatha Christie story considering its general look and feel. While it certainly is a minor mystery work with a fairly obvious solution it does have many enjoyable qualities that make the film worth viewing. The great Helen Hayes in what would prove to be her last on screen performance I feel makes a perfectly good Miss Marple despite her American origin and while she is no replacement for the legendary Margaret Rutherford or Joan Hickson in the role she makes the role her own and has in particular a wonderful chemistry with Leo McKern in their very enjoyable scenes together where they match wits and exchange barbs while trying to solve the murder. Of course the greatest shock is in seeing how much illness and old age had by this time ravaged the great Bette Davis and she plays a most passive and frail character here which is light years away from the power house Davis we all have grown accustomed to seeing on screen. Her character really is a walking skeleton and it's sad to contrast the much more agile and spunky Helen Hayes with this fast fading Hollywood legend in their scenes together. The main supporting cast is adequate for this type of ""murder in a country house"", type of story. The exception of course is the terrific Leo Mckern as the frustrated Inspector trying to keep one step ahead of Miss Marple in solving the murder. Playing a role very similiar to his most famous character of Rumpold of the Bailey McKern makes a delightful sleuth who is second guessed every time by the seemingly fuddy Miss Marple. These pair of characters bring the story to life and really dont leave many opportunities for fine performers such as Sir. John Mills, Dorothy Tutin and Anton Rodgers to steal scenes from them. ""Murder With Mirrors"", while definately lacking in the usual Agatha Christie atmosphere is however still very rich in high production values with the on location shooting at Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire giving the film an unexpectedly rich and opulent look unusual in television movies such as this. What has been retained from the expected approach that Agatha Christie would take in such a story are the many enjoyable red herrings thrown in the path of the viewer in the lead up to the expected climax when all the main characters assemble and the killer is finally revealed. This section of ""Murder With Mirrors"", was done very well with predictably just about every main character having a motive.When one is asked to recall a classic Agatha Christie movie thoughts of course automatically go to efforts such as ""Murder on the Orient Express"", and it is almost certain that ""Murder With Mirrors"", would never rate very highly on the lists of any Christie enthusiast. It is however an enjoyable little effort worth spending some time with. Christie purists have of course objected to the American Helen Hayes playing such a icon of British detective fiction as Miss Marple, however she does well in the part bringing just the right elements of daffy nosiness, sly cunning, and detective know how, to make the character her own in this film. For an enjoyable couple of hours mystery lovers should check out ""Murder With Mirrors"", with its red herrings and veteran cast of acting legends for a good but not great viewing experience.",Murder With Mirrors VHS
802723,"As I look over all the reviews to ""Freaks and Geeks"" I can't help but feel that this particular review is a waste of time. Still, I am compelled to praise this excellent show that NBC eventually passed on...the fools.Other shows have tried but most have failed in portraying a realistic high school setting. A few succeeded, their was ""Room 222"" an excellent show that remarkably still holds up today.  Sara Jessica Parker was never cuter than she was in ""Square Pegs"", another short live show similar in theme to ""Freaks"". ""DeGassi"", a Canadian import, was also quite good in exhibiting the trials and tribulations of high school life. That's pretty much it. Others like ""90201"", ""Saved by the Bell"", ""A Different World"", ""That's so Raven"", ""Boy Meets World"", the ""O.C."" and on and on and on all need to bow in respect to ""Freaks"". Granted each show has it's own agenda and it's own audience but it kills me that these shows succeeded where in ""Freaks and Geeks"" didn't. It' not ""The O.C.s"" fault that ""Freaks"" got canceled and ""The O.C.s"" not a terrible show, but it doesn't elevate you like ""Freaks"" does.See, ""Freaks and Geeks"" is a show about underdogs and outsiders.  The first shot of the first show sums it up best. We start in on a jock and his girl friend exchanging cow eyes in the football stands as sweet music fills the scene, then the camera tilts down to under the bleachers. The music turns hard as kids with wild hair and sloppy clothes exchange words and cigarette butts. The scene says it all.

904638,"Ki-duk Kim delivers an inquisitive blow to the audience with his film titled Bad Guy.  Here he intends to make the audience question whether humans can get along despite differences in class, education, appearance, and other social standards that the society creates.  On the surface these differences might not be what the viewer discovers, but in retrospect, or maybe even during the film, the notion of harmony among human differences might emerge in consciousness.  Nonetheless, Ki-duk Kim paints a cinematic tapestry of brutality and hatred that strikes deep into the soul and core of humanity.Bad Guy is not unlike Ki-duk Kim's other films in regards to the symbolism and the artistic expression that this South Korean director strives to visualize on the silver screen.  Yet, the situation is new and the story is unique even though he returned to teenage prostitution in Samaria (2004), the English title Samaria Girl.  The depicted cruelty often finds its place in Ki-duk Kim's films, may be even a reason for his popularity.  However, it is in the moment of viciousness where he generates the artistic moment that crosses between what is acceptable and unacceptable.  These are moments where opposite sides cross into each other's sphere like a bridge built for a moment that is destroyed in the next instant.  The violence can be seen in films such as the Isle (2000) where a woman pulls up a man by a fish hook and the dog killings in Address Unknown (2001).  It is in these violent moments where Ki-duk Kim reaches the furthest while trying to communicate his message to the audience.Cleverly, Ki-duk Kim opens Bad Guy with a scene of a city street where hundreds of of people are wandering during business hour.  People are shown from all walks of life, ugly and pretty, rich and poor, and among them emerges the silent anti-hero of the story Han-gi (Jae-hyeon Jo) who discovers Sun-hwa (Won Seo).  They are from opposite social classes.  Han-gi comes from the lower class while Sun-hwa is a member of the upper class.  Han-gi is a quiet, perhaps of his servitude class, pimp from the part of the town nobody admits they are from, or want to visit unless it is for carnal pleasure. Sun-hwa is the pretty college girl most men would turn their head to look at twice who is both refined and educated.When Han-gi's eyes lands on Sun-hwa for the first time he cannot take them of her, as she sits on a park bench.  He stands there dumbfounded almost drooling all over himself while observing her from a distance.  Awkwardly, he approaches her and is unable to speak he sits down next to her.  Sun-hwa steps away seemingly threatened by his stare and presence, and possibly his looks.  After all he has a thick and long scar running horizontally over his throat.  When her boyfriend arrives Han-gi continues to stare at her.  All of a sudden Han-gi walks up and kisses her right in front of the boyfriend who helplessly tries to remove him.  Consequently, the situation escalates when Sun-hwa demands an apology for Han-gi's transgression, which ends with him getting a severe beating from a large number of bystanders.Like a ghost Han-gi returns to his home in the poor community where girls sell themselves for a few meager bucks while bribing off nosy police officers with their only assets.  Angry and vindictive Han-gi intends to repay the mistreatment in a Machiavellian style where he concocts a trap where Sun-hwa gets into big debt.  Unable to pay off the debt she ends up becoming a slave-like prostitute where she must pay with her body and face.  Silently, Han-gi continues to watch her through a one-way mirror while she begins and continues her new life as a prostitute.  This of course has strong symbolic value in regards to the transparency of the lower class's view of the upper class while the narcissism of the rich blinds them from seeing the poor.Ki-duk Kim's presentation of the theme is a very uncomfortable cinematic experience, yet he succeeds through this tragedy to make people think about the differences between Han-gi and Sun-hwa.  In addition, to strengthen his message he experiments with distance between the characters through both tangible and intangible symbols throughout the whole film.  In essence, the story turns into a macabre education of class struggle and differences between people where Ki-duk Kim does not hold back in his social criticism.  The film is both bizarre and surreal while also humane underneath all the ugliness, as Ki-duk Kim displays his brilliant ability to create visual fabrications from his personal artistic vision that will continue to mesmerize many for a long time.",Bad Guy
576898,"I love and will always this movie The Wolves of Kromer ~ Will Gould (III).  The Wolves of Kromer is now the movie I like most of all in life.  Don't buy this movie expecting your typical horror gore bloodfest because this movie does not even try to go there.  This movie addresses gay social issues, homophobia all the attendant ignorance amd hate it spawns.  Wolves and werewolves are more a recurring methaphor in the movie than fact.  Yes the script and story line could have used some tightening up.  Yes the pace was too slow and the people were a little bit too one demensional but none of that took away from the underlying power messages about how stupid homophobia is this movie sent on many levels.  Yes there could have been more action and better character development and I would agree the movie had more than its share of flaws and bad production values but, I suggest the sheer power of its political message delivered using the Wolf \ Werewolf metaphor was artistic genius and more than makes up for any cinematic lapses in style and quality in other areas.I usually hate movies that come to a tragic end but The Wolves of Kromer end's with a healthy degree of tragic irony that effectively drives the whole point of the movie home in a way worthy of the best hollywood has to offer.  I watched this movie not expecting too much and ended up getting my eyes opened and my heart stolen.  I can tell you now The Wolves of Kromer is a movie you can only understand completely if you have struggled with gay issues in your own life.

897279,"In some respects there'd be no Law and Order without the films of Sidney Lumet-specifically the ones about police corruption and the compromises that cops and lawyers are sometimes forced to make. These themes are the foundation for Dick Wolf's long-running TV show. Like Lumet's police procedure movies, Law and Order takes a just-the-facts approach. We are given no to very little details about the characters' private lives. The show also utilizes gritty, New York City locales filled with tough cops, down-on-their-luck losers and cocky lawyers. Each episode feels like an hour-long version of such Lumet films as Prince of the City or Q & A.Law and Order is the no frills alternative to NYPD Blue which tended to dwell as much on the detectives' personal lives as it did on the actual cases. Law and Order jettisons the interpersonal relationships in favour of also showing what happens to suspects once they go to court. This offers a more balanced view of our law enforcement and justice system that most other shows do not provide. There is something addictive about this show that sucks you in as you're watching an episode and pretty soon you've watched a whole bunch of them. Season three is a good snap-shot of the show in its prime and once Jerry Orbach joined the cast it got even better.There are eight deleted scenes for six episodes that don't really contain anything all that memorable except for the occasional bit of business between characters.""Jerry Orbach Tribute"" is a way-too brief celebration of the late-great actor. Considering how important Orbach was to the success of the show it is rather disappointing the brevity of this extra.""Jerry Orbach Profile"" offers a look at the actor in his natural environment: working on the show.

880048,"Only a week ago, I watched HOOK, and although it was a well done film, I've never been a real PETER PAN fan, so it was with some hesitance that I decided to view FINDING NEVERLAND.  But this wonderful and brilliant film is not so much about how J. M. Barrie came to create Peter Pan, but the story of relationships touched by love, admiration and most importantly imagination.  Barrie was Peter Pan, a grown man who still wanted to be a little boy.  As embodied by the amazingly versatile Johnny Depp, J.M. Barrie becomes a symbol of that youthful innocence we all would love to maintain.  It is a deeply realized, thoughtful and outstanding addition to the amazing repertoire of characters Depp has given us in the past few years.  For once, Depp doesn't look like the eternal teenager, using his dark good looks more as an adult than any film he's done, ironic in that his character still wants to be a boy. Depp never allows his character to sink into predictable maudlin behavior with the Davises; he maintains an honest, forthright position with them and his social climbing wife as well.  In finally taking Sylvia to Neverland, in a heart-rending finale, Depp shows us the depth of his performance.  Kate Winslet continues her chameleonic talents in the role of Sylvia; her every movement, gesture and dialogue carries the weight of a woman who has lost her husband and is facing her own imminent death.  Never self-effacing, or mawkish, Winslet's performance is a glowing one, and when she goes to neverland, it is a three hanky moment.  Freddie Highmore as the young Peter, a little boy who seems to be growing up too fast, is devastatingly brilliant.  A cute Haley Joel Osment clone, Highmore brings such depth and believability to this role, he is amazing, and should have garnered a Best Supporting Actor nomination and win, for this beautifully performed role.  The scene in which he asks Depp why his Mommy had to die is heartbreaking and beautiful.  Director Mark Forster rounds out his cast with marvelous performances from the rest of the little boys; Julie Christie brings a depth to a cliche role as the rather diabolical mother of Winslet, but as we get to know her better, we can see where her motherly love is taking her.  Christie hasn't had a role this good in years; and of course, the superb Dustin Hoffman gives us a remarkably understated performance as the producer who funds Barrie's plays, and his moment of amazement when he realizes Peter Pan is going to be successful is typical Hoffman brilliance.  Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, Open Water) gives a marvelously restrained performance as Barrie's wife, whose reverence for social climbing ultimately results in the destruction of their marriage; it isn't really Barrie's spending time with the Davises, but the fact that the two were mismatched from the beginning that separates them.FINDING NEVERLAND is one of my favorite films I've viewed in the past year, and its Oscar nominations were richly deserved.  Johnny Depp would have stood a good chance of winning Best Actor had it not been the same year as Jamie Foxx's brilliant Ray Charles.  But Depp has range and endurance and I know one day he's going to be up at the podium, and deservedly so.  Don't let the movie's ""quietness"" keep you from viewing it.  It is vastly entertaining and really what moviemaking is all about.",Finding Neverland
741794,"Back in the mid 1980's, when Yngwie first burst onto the scene, Yngwie Malmsteen said that a dream of his was to compose a concerto for Electric Guitar and Orchestra. After hearing ""Rising Force"", I always thought that it would be great to hear ""Black Star"", ""Far beyond the Sun"" and ""Icarus Dream Suite"" played with the depth of an orchestra in the background instead of rock instruments. At the beginning of this millenium, the dream was realized with the release of ""Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra"" on CD. Now that same Suite is available on DVD. This is not a typical working of a rock band and orchestra which has been done by everyone from Elton John to Metallica. Yngwie wrote every note for every instrument and even for a full Choir. His understanding of music theory is far superior to any previous attempts at orchestra and rock.(Except for Keith Emerson) Proof of this can be heard on the ""Black Star Overture"" which features the orchestra playing melodies from 'Black Star' in an overture style. This really shows how Yngwie's classical style can stand out on its own without him playing over it.  The Concerto Suite is aptly named as it doesn't follow the typical 3 movement format of a romantic period Concerto. Instead, this is a real classically styled Suite with an electric guitar replacing a violin. The Concerto Suite is divided into eleven parts. All of the parts have their own defined melodies and style. The Concerto Suite will not disappoint fans of Malmsteen's technique as all of the string skipping, Sweep Picking and alternate picking styles of Yngwie are played over some orchestrated melodies. The orchestration might not be on par with Bach, Vivaldi or someone of the actual Classical Era but it is far better than any Avante Garde period orchestration. The orchestration is diverse enough to sound like it could belong to the Classical or Romantic period. It would be great to hear Yngwie compose Baroque Period Counterpoint like his idol J.S. Bach, but that might be on the second Concerto Suite.As previously stated, the guitar playing by Yngwie has never been better. He lets loose on all of the parts of the suite and plays some amazing acoustic guitar on ""Prelude"" and ""Tocatta"". He is truly enjoying himself and the guitar playing shows it.Also on this DVD is the ""Icarus Dream Fanfare"" which is a piece based on the main theme from 'Icarus Dream Suite"". This piece also is amazing and the greatness of the main theme is accentuated even when Yngwie does his thing over it. No overplaying by Malmsteen on this one.There are also great orchestrated versions of ""Trilogy Suite"", ""Blitzkrieg"", ""Evil Eye"", ""Brothers"" and ""Far Beyond the Sun"". All of these are superior to the versions with a rock band. The version of ""Far Beyond the Sun"" is simply incredible, and I wish that Yngwie would do more of this on the next Concerto Suite. His ability to compose classical influenced melodies and to play guitar like a violin are much more clear with an orchestra and not with a rock band.I highly recommend this to fans of Yngwie or to anyone who wants to hear something so original it defies previous conventions. The wait for true Classical Rock is over. Yngwie's realization is better than the dream.",N/A

533982,"I am bit amused to read so many negative reviews about this movie which people complaints of historical inaccuracy and all that sort of nonsense. And these are probably the same people who praised movies like Braveheart, Elizabeth, Windtalkers and other numerous historical movies that have no concept of being historically accurate.Enemy at the Gates is based on the true Soviet hero but obviously it been fictionalized to meet the Hollywood's standards for entertainment and story. This is typical and not abnormal as some people thinks. Jude Law does an very good job in the lead role and he proves to be well supported by his supporting cast members like Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Wiesz and Ed Harris. Does it really matter if Ed Harris' German sniper ace really existed or not?? Does it matter that Mel Gibson wore kilts in Braveheart when real William Wallace never did?? Or Christ was nailed on the Latin cross in Passion of Christ when he was actually nailed on a Roman ""T"" cross? I guess not so when does historical inaccuracy doom any movie??The movie was made with a singular view point of Jude Law's character. Fiennes' character was most uneven as he goes from overzealous promoter to jealous lover. The romance angle was not bad as Rachel Weisz provided an interesting character. Their love scene among the dirty sleeping soldiers in the bunker add a certain level of reality to their situation. Ed Harris provides an interesting and challenging foe as an ace German sniper whose ego regarded his duel with Vassili like a game. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining as both sides play their cat and mouse game as the story unfold. Interestingly, you never really know who's the mouse and who's playing the cat!The DVD of Enemy at the Gates proves to be a pretty good set. The image quality is pretty good and the sound effects works well in Dolby Digital 5.1. There are also few extra features included in the DVD which may or may not enchane your viewing pleasure.I thought this was one of the underrated World War II movies that came out in our recent years. It could just be that Soviet heroes are not popular Hollywood material (Harrison Ford's K-19 movie sunk at the box offices too).",Enemy At the Gates

Then she has these little tea time moments. The sense of humor that she has most the time makes it hard to believe she can even get into a serious mode.

172583,"I am a little suspicious of short stories that are turned into movies.  I always wonder: How are they going to fill the other hour-and-a-half?  Strangely, this problem does not occur in Brokeback Mountain.  I'd read the short story first and - watching the movie - I did not feel that they were padding for time.  In fact, it seems like the story can barely be contained to the time restrictions of the movie.Perhaps this is because this movie is about emotions and images - not words.  Its characters are not from a very verbal society.  In fact, it is a running joke in the film how little Ennis (Heath Ledger) speaks.  The little dialogue from the short story lasts the whole movie.This is a Western - Ang Lee beautifully captures the Wyoming countryside.  When the action moves into town, the sight of man's raunchy trailers and houses set against the backdrop of the majestic mountains makes a convincing argument for nature over civilization.It is civilization that is ultimately the downfall of these two characters.  They meet and fall in love - all the while convinced that they are not homosexuals.  The story begins in 1963 and - if it had occurred a little later - tragedy may have been averted.  Yet, despite the tragic overtones of the story, there is still something joyful about it.  Despite all odds, these two men find each other and - a few times a year at least - find true happiness.

It's a plot that doesn't seem too different from anything else offered in many of the previous Bond films, but the premise works thanks to some slam bang spectacular action scenes and the further development of Brosnan's interpretation of the character.  Also on board is Desperate Housewives' Teri Hatcher as one of Bond's former lovers, and Hong Kong action star Michelle Yeoh as a very letal secret agent who Bond teams up with.

Definitely worth even 20 dollars for it..It was a great comedy movie, and finally a smart film, not some stupid, plain comedy!As the film rolls along, we see all the drama play out and how characters will lie to try and fool the Existential Detectives, but the joke's on them. Seeing how Jude Law becomes unraveled once his jovial facade is punctured by the detectives, as well as how Schwartzman's existential angst is traced back to an event in childhood is just amazing to watch. This film is so right on with the psychology books I've read and my own ponderings into my inner life. People should see this film over and over and use the information presented to examine their own inner nature. It will lead to some profound conclusions. Its a shame this film wasn't discovered by more people in theaters. I think it would make an excellent TV series as Existential Detectives take on new clients each week, as viewers learn about how important events from our past affect our perception of the world and how we view others and ourselves. My favorite line in the film is when Naomi Watts tells Jude Law something like ""you just can't deal with my infinite nature!"" Brilliant. The music is also a perfect match for the film.

Consequently, I found the DVD extra's to be much more interesting than the movie itself, which is quite the opposite of my usual feeling(s).

851476,"I don't believe director Antoine Fuqa meant ""King Arthur"" to be a comedy or burlesque. So, why was I laughing ten minutes into the film? The movie, about the Roman departure from Britain in the fifth century, and the subsequent invasion of the Saxon hordes, resembles a Hollywood historical epic extravaganza, circa 1960. The first battle scene did me in. The new bishop from Rome, accompanied by a contingent of mighty Roman soldiers on their way to their base near Hadrian's wall, are attacked by Woads, an army of Pictish freedom fighters in delightful blue body paint. Tattoo artists are going to make a bundle from this film! I watched in disbelief as the primitive Picts, on foot, slaughter the mounted elite Romans. Now these are the forces who conquered most of the known world. I don't think these fighting professionals pick-off more than 6 or 7 natives while they, in turn, are being slaughtered. Tell me that's not a rigged fight! Enter the Sarmatian calvary to the rescue, led by their commander, Artorius/Arthur. Suddenly the seemingly invincible Picts are slaughtered like canon fodder, (which has yet to be invented), by the newcomers. How could the Woads be so good one moment and so bad the next?? Talk about contrived! So, from this violent interaction, I concluded that the Romans were the bad guys, the Sarmatians the good ones, and the Woads indeterminate - because Arthur allows their leader to go free. Now, I loved ""Brave Heart,"" ""Rob Roy"" was a good movie too, as was ""Gladiator."" Although Hollywood spectaculars in nature, these movies were believable enough for me to empathize with the characters. I had something to work with - someone to root for!Not to be picky, but as soon as the various fighting forces begin to parlay I began to giggle. The Sarmatians all have different accents - they sound like representatives from diverse parts the UK, and perhaps Australia. The Romans speak English with heavy Italian accents, and when the Saxons eventually speak their lines, their leader Cerdic, (Stellan Skarsgard) sounds like Joe Cocker with a cold. Their soldiers just grunt, but in different dialects. There must have been a worldwide casting call for this film. This is distracting! The dialogue throughout is too cliched to be campy - are you getting the drift? The plot is too predictable. I did like the idea of a revisionist Arthurian history, but David Franzoni's screenplay destroyed the credibility for me. There are moments of cleverness - but too few and far between. I was, and am, very disappointed.The Sarmatians, from the steppes of Central Asia, were conquered by Rome, and their sons forced as adolescents to join the Roman calvary for a fifteen year period. After rigorous training, a group of these impressed soldiers are stationed, with their leader Lancelot, (Ioan Gruffudd) in Britain, where they hang-out with local women, breed like rabbits, complain about the weather, gamble and fight the Woads, whenever they venture south of the wall. Their commander is Arthur, (Clive Owen), a man of mixed parentage, who was born and raised in Britain, is loyal to Rome, but also staunchly loyal to his men. And the Sarmatians are devoted to him.Arthur's knights - Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) -- are about to return home to their families in Sarmatia after having fulfilled their 15 years of service. Their freedom is to officially begin the day after Bishop Germanius, (Ivano Marescotti), arrives. In this period, just before the Dark Ages, the Catholic Church rules in Rome through the emperor. The villainous prelate forces them to go on one last mission where they see, first-hand, examples of Roman cruelty and the brutality of the Saxon invaders, who are determined to take over where the Roman's leave off. These Nordic warriors show their stuff, amidst many more grunts, roars and bloody hacking during an action-packed battle on ice, which was a highpoint - much better and gorier than the Ice Capades. It is on this mission that they acquire Guinevere, (Keira Knightley), a Woadish nymphet who had been captured and tortured by the Romans in an attempt to convert her to Christianity. She is the cleanest one in the movie, and the prettiest, with a sexy, goth-style wardrobe and pouty lips. As a warrioress, she's good with a bow and arrow, and as a love interest, she sighs her way through love scenes with Arthur.Arthur and his band of merry knights decide to stay and fight for Britain, and join forces with Merlin, (Stephen Dillane), the Woad leader, to expel the Saxons. The rest is not history, nor even legend. Boo!JANA",King Arthur
702717,"From Monogram Pictures comes this ridiculously funny, but very fun poverty row film. Boris Karloff, just one year after playing the Frankenstein monster for the last time in ""Son Of Frankenstein, does his own mad doctor role in ""The Ape"". He stars as the seemingly kindly, old Dr. Adrian, a small town doctor and the subject of much talk amongst the town folks. They think the doctor is up to no good with all of his crazy experiments and they would like to be rid of him. Turns out that Adrian was kicked out of a research institute some 25 years ago for performing unethical experiments involving the use of spinal fluids.Dr. Adrian is trying to cure a wheelchair-bound patient named Francis of her paralysis but is having no luck obtaining the experimental spinal fluid. He gets his chance when a cruel animal handler is attacked by an escaped circus ape and taken to Adrian's home for treatment. Rather than help the man, he kills him and takes his spinal fluid. He injects the fluid into the woman and she begins to have feeling in her legs. But Adrian dropped the last vial of fluid and destroyed it. When the ape crashes into his home, Adrian kills it, and makes an ape costume out of the hide. With the town sheriff and the residents still thinking the ape is on the loose, Adrian uses the ape costume to commit more murders to obtain more spinal fluid.You don't want to over analyze the Ape too much as the plot holes are big enough to drive a truck through. I mean since no one sees Adrian dressed as the ape when he goes out to kill someone, why does he even need the outfit to begin with? The cast is strictly B or even less than B. Off hand I was not familiar with any of the other actors in the film by name although I did recognize Henry Hall who played Sheriff Halliday as Hall made a career out of playing sheriff's in B westerns.The copy I saw ran only 58 minutes and was very choppy and dialogue often cuts off in mid-sentence. Still, how can you pass up Karloff in an ape suit? Karloff's next several pictures after ""The Ape"" were for studios such as Universal, Columbia, and RKO and one wonders why he needed to do such low-rent films. Not that I'm complaining, mind you...Reviewed By Tim Janson",The Ape
157381,"I had heard of `The Amityville Horror' series, but passed it off many times as just another haunted house movie. Now that the new version is releasing in April, I thought `sure why not?' and decided to rent this movie.The story is about the Lutz family, consisting of George (the dad, played by James Brolin), Kathy (the wife, played by Margot Kidder), and their kids, Amy, Greg and Matt. They move into a new house on Amityville, Long Island, which is huge, for a really cheap price, because of the history of the house. Before they moved in, a man who lived there shot he wife and four kids in the house while they were sleeping and then shot himself; the reason unknown. Once the Lutz family moves in, each of them start experiencing strange things. The priest who comes in the house sees flies and becomes ill. George starts acting different and begins to feel cold all the time. Amy makes friends with `Jody', a person nobody else can see. A windowsill pushes down on Greg's hand and gets stuck there, making him bleed. Kathy starts suspecting that there is something really wrong with the house. Her Aunt, a nun, too falls ill upon entering the house. Kathy's brother finds his money disappeared before the wedding. Can Kathy prevent the house from taking over her family before it's too late?I wouldn't call this movie really scary. There were some really eerie moments like the flies, and the rocking chair in Amy's room, but apart from that, it very pretty much bland. While the background music really gives a creepy feeling during the scenes, the special effects just ruin it. I know this movie was taken in 1979, but so were the Star Trek series and I felt that they could have made the ghost look more horrifying. The actors, however, did a wonderful job in the movie. James Brolin and Margot Kidder acted splendidly as did Rod Steiger as Father Delaney. Stuart Rosenberg, did a good job with the direction.I wouldn't really call it spooky, since I felt that the `Poltergeist' was made much better than this, since it's in the same genre.

With his good looks and golden curls he almost makes me think of the sun god, Apollo. Just his presence is unique and it is very hard to take your eyes off him, because his acting is so believable.I also strongly believe that the movie just wouldn't be the same if it weren't for the music and the artwork. The costumes are brilliant and really make the cast stand out. Everyone works so well together.  The special featuers are also a special treat. Duchess Sarah Fergusoneven gives a little speach about Peter Pan's past and his meaning in today's society.

But, given that this IS a sequel to the very good, ""The Mask of Zorro"", one cannot help the inevitable comparison, and there is none.  And one would expect this new movie to be in a similar vein as that of its predecessor.  It's not.While the prior Zorro movie was smart, charming, blessed with believable action, and above all, HUMAN, the universe of this Zorro movie seems to be in an alternate dimension where people rarely bleed, the laws of physics need not apply, and people make personal choices that no one can understand or relate to.  The only characterization I can conceive is a confused collage of Zorro, Batman, and the ""Wild Wild West"".I really do like action movies, and am in no way a ""movie snob"", but this is one of the very few movies that my wife and I very nearly walked out of - it was that bad.

775554,"This French film did an excellent job of showing the process of coming out as a young gay man in a clever insightful manner. Etienne, a graceful competitive ice skater, receives a hand held video camera for his 16th birthday and begins a year long video diary. The wonderful twist on this plot devise is that the viewer  now gets to see everthing that catches Etienne's eye, including passages of young working class laborers and firemen hunks. We see Etienne become obsessed with his handsome geography teacher whom he stalks and films. When Etienne is caught filming his teacher in class, a discussion between Laurent his teacher and his mother initiates a new love affair between the two. Of course this allows even more opportunities for Etienne to film and observe Laurent.Etienne's best friend is handsome Ludovic who moves from virgin to young Don Juan. Etienne shows no interest in girls but rather follows Ludovic around filming him dancing with, kissing, and eventually making love to young women.Etienne's innocence is charming and childlike. He films the other skaters in the dressing room and eventually is confronted by both Ludovic and Laurent regarding his filming. It is Laurent who confronts Etienne that his filming indicates he is attracted to men.The video diary approach to this film was very fresh and clever with Etienne and Ludovic playing many games while filmaking.The acting of all the characters was superb. Etienne's charming, beautiful, athletic mother was perfect for a young bright skater. His grandmother was charming. The handsome actors that played Ludovic and Laurent both perfect for their roles.  The city of Rouen and the Normandy coast were a great setting and the film convinced you of setting and place.Finally, several reviewers were concerned with the somewhat abrupt ending of the film. Etienne finally goes to bed with a young fellow and the film ends with them playing with the camera in bed filming each other after love making. I had no problem with this ending at all. After a year of struggling with obsession for his teacher and best friend, Etienne finds a young man with similar sexual orientation and the pieces begin to fall into place. Young gay men become obsessed with the handsome heterosexual males in their lives until they learn to focus this attention on men with their same sexual orientation, or at least the ones who want to minimize their frustration soon learn to focus. I felt that film ended with Etienne reaching this point in his life and the filmakers certainly took us on a delightful journey to reach this point.",N/A

Each episode even has an ""extended"" theme song, where the Clampetts hawk that week's sponsor (Winston cigarettes or Kellogg's Corn Flakes). And the promised commercials (same two products) are great too. It looks like each episode had it's own commercial in the same setting. I lost count but there are at least 20 of them, not the 3 or 4 I was expecting. The bonus features of Buddy Ebsen on some ""vaudeville"" special and Irene Ryan on a show hosted by Roy Rodgers and Dale Evens were fun to see one time.And the shows: priceless. With witty writing and excellent acting, especially by Raymond Bailey (Mr. Drysdale) and Buddy Ebsen, though of course Irene Ryan and Max Baer are hilarious performers too. Most TV series find their legs in the second season, but the first four episodes here (all I've watched so far--I'll update this review if any technical glitches turn up) are brilliant.The minor complaints: The ""unseen"" pilot is really just a slightly different edit of the well-known first episode. And... that's about it really. I guess the booklet could have provided more background on the bonus materials. (There is an hour-long documentary feature that I haven't watched, ""Paul Hennig and the Clampetts"", that might have more information.) But really, if you think you want this set, you do want it.",N/A
348406,"The Hidden Fortress is classic Kurosawa, in every way--except for the wild overacting, inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film.  Had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued, or given comic material with more edge, skewering the upper classes as well as themselves, or been less in the focus and operated far in the background, this wouldn't have been a problem.  But instead we're offered a sort of Dumb & Dumber, Beavis & Butthead of Japan, 50 years ago.  (And yes, I know that is anachronistic, but it's all too true.)  ""Stupidity is funny"" wears thin after a short while, and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast.  Oh, here comes a rocky upwards incline: let's watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up, etc.Which is all too bad, because while the rest of the film has its overblown heroics, its far from bad.  The interactions between cast members has both tension and grit, while the outdoor settings mark a difference from the usual run of Japanese period films (though Kurosawa addicts like myself will well recall what he could do in Roshomon).  Mifune is over the top but splendid, and the direction has energy and focus.I've seen this film twice in 25 years; most recently, just last night, again.  Unfortunately, my initial impressions were only confirmed--and I wish they weren't.",The Hidden Fortress VHS
892659,"Luis Bu&ntilde;uel began his career filming a short film, Un Chien Andalou (1929), together with Salvador Dali and they agreed on one thing before making the film - the idea that each scene should not reveal anything in regards to rational thought.  At the end of his career Bu&ntilde;uel made The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), which won the Oscar for the best foreign film in 1973.  Winning the Oscar and the success of the film gave Bu&ntilde;uel an opportunity create whatever he desired.  Consequently, Bu&ntilde;uel returned to his accustomed traditions of surrealism and the workings of the subconscious through a cinematic experience that would leave many scratching their heads and applauding simultaneously - The Phantom of Liberty.The Phantom of Liberty, in essence, is not a single film in the traditional sense, as Bu&ntilde;uel moves away from cinematic convention by breaking the rules of filmmaking.  The principal distinction from other films is that Bu&ntilde;uel draws the audience's attention to the film by presenting an idea that he slowly makes more interesting by introducing additional stimuli that build up the intrigue.  However, when the intrigue enters the climax Bu&ntilde;uel simply leaves the story where it become most stimulating.  At this point he starts over with another less interesting story that moves forward with new intrigue that once again intensifies, and as before he tosses away the intrigue by starting over.One of these stories within the film opens with ""I'm sick of symmetry."", as a man sits down watching the fireplace and a large preserved spider.  The man stands up while picking up the spider, as he shortly after slides the clock above the fireplace to the left and places the spider on the right.  This scene has nothing to do with what is about to happen, but it offers a brilliant analogy to how simple it is for Bu&ntilde;uel to break the chains of cinematic convention in this film.  Yet, the film has a common thread that continues throughout the film, which brings to mind Marquis de Sade's literary works.  Much of the film offers suggestive sexual and erotic situations where some are more overt than others.The opening of the film takes place in 1808 during Napoleon's occupation of Toledo where the French Army executes captured resistance while the officers are getting drunk within a church.  One of these drunk officers finds a sculpture of a kneeling woman attractive with which he tries to make advances on, but to the audience's astonishment the male kneeling statue next to him stops the officer with a resolute smack to the head.  This is one of several scenes in the film where a character presents deviant sexual behavior.  There is also the man who advances on a prepubescent girl on the playground, the family that defecates in the living room, and the four monks that play poker with the lady in a nightgown.  None of these scenes are explicit in nature, but the mere situation provides strong suggestive notion of the sexually tense moments that also have strong surreal ambiance.Each moment in the film surrounds a surreal element that causes a cerebral conflict.  These moments seem dreamlike, but with enough reality to keep the audience guessing of what will happen next.  For example, there is a man who tries to go to sleep and is visited by an enormous rooster, a candle carrying woman, a postman who delivers a letter, and an emu.  Later, the man visits a doctor, as he found the night extremely disturbing to which the doctor responds that he must see a psychoanalyst.  To convince the doctor the man shows the letter that he received from the postman that visited him during the night in his bedroom.  Cleverly, Bu&ntilde;uel displays the workings of the surreal in the subconscious, as he let reality converge with dream.  This makes it more difficult for the audience to separate the two, as they simply fall into what seems to be a blender that mixes anything that falls inside.Visually The Phantom of Liberty offers something like a stroll through an art museum's section with surrealism, which suggests that Luis Bu&ntilde;uel is not simply a film director trying to tell a story in the traditional sense.  Through Bu&ntilde;uel's direction the audience can experience a plasticity in the manner the film moves along, but it is idiosyncratic in contrasts to the other cinematic geniuses such as Kurosawa, Fellini, and Bergman among others.  It is the peculiarity of Bu&ntilde;uel that makes him unique, as he did not try to do what has already been made.  Instead he took the step into the unexplored and brought back from the deepest corners of the human psyche several experiences that none have ever been able to match.  Thus, the Phantom of Liberty offers a distillation of Bu&ntilde;uel himself.",N/A

My kids got this one from Grandma around the time my youngest was born.  Although the other Barney DVDs that have found there way into our house have been quietly re-routed to other places, I find this one much less irritating than the other Barney episodes that have been borrowed from the library.  Since the video wasn't designed for parents, it's best recommendation is that after more than two years, my kids still watch it at least once every few weeks (about as often as I offer it).There's some information on the animals, including some views that only very lucky zoo-goers ever get to see.  Other than that, there's lots of the singing and dancing characteristic of Barney.  It's a hit with my kids.",Barney - Let's Go to the Zoo VHS
946187,"Its a detractor that promotional reviews and moviedoms promotional bandwagon've spilt it up that the movie's about Clones- whence it would've granted moviegoers a better feel for the film if it weren't so.It've done me good that I've a momentary lapse of memory about this when I went to see the film last night.Peculiarly it opens much too similarly with the set up and all the conceptual contexts of George Lucas' first flick and short project film THX1138 (which coincidentally I've just recentl;y purchased along with Michael Todd's AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS (and on another note having bought also quite only recently Pearl Jam's Mike McReady's side project with other band members from other bands called THE ROCKFORDS (which featured HEART (now LOVEMONGERS)'s Nancy Wilson (said to be one of the most dangerous wimmen along with Imelda Marcos accd to MotorCity Madman Ted Nuge(nt)(see all the thematical synchronicities?)))) have in their album's last track a song called 'Island' which lingered over and over in my head for days now); Part Gatacca and BLADE RUNNER- the movie also incorporated some parts on its set up of the year 2031(?) much similar with the likes of METROPOLIS ( a flick i found out's again missed by me as shown just last week hacked with a lokal band as such) or FUTURAMA for that matter. Plotwise our hero, the guy who played young Kenobi went into a similar process of gradually finding/witnessing out about the truth behind their so-called decontamination confinement, much like when Heston underwent to find out what SOYLENT GREEN (the movie title)- a bisquit essential to contain enough of the required nutrients for the starving masses of the future- are made out of.Just watched the flick last night on my way to a nightshift's work. And although I nearly fell asleep by the half of it- yep that escape scene with Ewan's character's found out love interest played by Scarlett Johansson - which commmences after the first half of the entire film's duration quite on the way throughout the rest of the film - I still comprehended it somehow..I think its just a hard thing to pin down about the movie, other than how it is that the Futuristic LAPD are depicted to've find it hard and even unattainable to capture two naivette clonies despite all of their heavy artillery and high technological armaments, (that I guess which only depicted how stupid these LA Cops and SWAT teams are in the film); which all along , the truck where Ewan and his girlfriend character hopped on a truck full of metal carriage that they found as their means for escape from these ants of chasing military people seems so hard to be convincing that with all of the racket going on about - how come the truck driver never found the idea to stop?? Perhaps the driver is so saturated on headphones with the music of the Steve Miller band while driving on his shades with a dark glassed front for a truck!The other great Clone fiction that there is IS the Spiderman Clone saga that began in the seventies and welled its way by '96 - which according to what i heard have folded disasterously like the franchise of DC's BATMAN movie series commenced by director Tim Burton.Next stop: the movie STEALTH",N/A
284449,"When the wife of a wealthy plantation owner in Malaysia kills a man she claims tried to assault her, an incriminating letter surfaces in the hands of the dead man's Eurasian wife (a stoic and bizarre Gale Sondergaard). Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis) had written the letter to the man demanding him to come over the day of his death. Now, with the help of a guilt ridden attorney (James Stephenson), she must retrieve the letter before it lands in the hands of the prosecutors. Directed by William Wyler, ""The Letter"" stands as one of Davis' most powerful films. Not only is she magnificent, but the film itself seethes with tension and sultry atmosphere. The plantation scenes are meticulously done with some shadows being painted on the ground (at Wyler's insistence) for more eerie moonlit shots. The moon plays a large role in ""The Letter"",  sort of as a governing body over the fates of certain characters.  A hint of Asian mysticism runs throughout as well implying that one cannot escape one's fate...especially if it involves retribution. Herbert Marshall (also with Davis in ""The Little Foxes"" again directed by Wyler) is excellent as the husband and plantation owner brought to ruin by ""the letter"". Warner's has done a fine job in presenting the film (based on W.Somerset Maugham's story) on DVD with good extras including an alternate ending that's more morbid. I couldn't decide which one I liked best. But it's Davis that you're watching here...constantly knitting to conceal her sexual frustration. And for her performance alone, ""The Letter"" is definitely a collector's item.",N/A

635762,"It's all Spider-Man's fault.  Ever since 2002, when ""Spider-Man"" debuted the week before the then-latest ""Star Wars"" film and proved to be a powerful contender in its own right against the intergalactic juggernaut, movie studios have been dragging out every Marvel or DC Comics license they can get their hands on and turning them into feature films.  Some are bombs (""The Hulk""), others do moderately well (""X-Men""), and some are even wildly successful (""Spider-Man 2"").  But all are generally the same:  The origin of classic comic book characters as they take down one of the fans' favorite villains.The latest offering in the comic book superhero department is ""The Fantastic Four"", about a quartet of colleagues with some very strange powers.  While on a space station monitoring a cloud of cosmic radiation, the cloud comes too close for comfort and exposes the scientists to the radiation, altering their DNA.  It is a comic book movie after all, its gotta be a little implausible.The ""leader"" of this new band of heroes is Reed Richards, a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd), who can stretch and bend his body at will.  A methodical, scientific man, Richards is glacial when it comes to making decisions, especially romantic ones, such as how to proceed with his relationship with Susan Storm, The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), who is able to project forcefields and (obviously) become invisible.  Susan's brother Johnny, now The Human Torch (Chris Evans) is a wise-cracking daredevil who can spontaneously combust at will and can, for some reason, fly.  Finally, there's poor Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who was the most exposed to the radiation, who becomes the orange rock-like The Thing.What makes this film stand out from other superhero movies is that rather than having the ""lone wolf"" superhero like Spider-Man or Batman, there's a whole group of them, which leads to interesting character dynamics.  Similar to Disney's ""The Incredibles"" in many ways, even down to most of the superpowers, ""The Fantastic Four"" capitalizes on its characters' relationships.This film has been criticized for having not enough action and too much character development, ironic considering that the problem with most comic book movies is actually the opposite.  ""Fantastic Four"" was entertaining for me because it's different.  Oh sure, there's the bad guy (getting the award for the cheesiest Bad Guy Name in history: Victor Von Doom, played by Julian McMahon) who must be stopped, but that takes a backseat to the larger problem of how these people must learn to deal with their newfound abilities and fame.  This is more then ""good guy-bad guy-fight"": and in fact, that particular aspect has been toned down to let the character struggles between the heroes take center stage.""The Fantastic Four"" is at heart, just another comic book superhero movie, but it is one that is done with honest care for good characters, good humor, and actual drama, as opposed to gratuitous violence and awesome special effects.",Fantastic Four
882440,"Burst Angel is another one of Gonzo Digimation's many releases this year (Gantz, Samurai 7, and Gankutsuou). It's one of those mecha/girls with guns series, only different in that it's a great deal better than the rest. That's not a surprise, as the director, Koichi Ohata, directed great anime films like M.D. Geist and Cybernetics Guardian. How else is it better? Well, read on.First off, episode one starts out with pure action, and displays quickly what the series will offer in terms of animation quality, as the CG mixes almost perfectly with the 2D effects. Then it goes from there to introduce the main characters, all of them, as quickly as possible: Jo, the fighter without a heart, Meg, the constant Damsel in distress, Amy, the tech-freak, and Sei, the leader of the bunch. They also introduce Kyohei, the lucky chef who gets to take care of these women's meals. After that's out of the way (it takes up probably five minutes of time) they quickly get back into the action. Episode two picks up immediately after as a continuation of episode one, and also introduces us to the dark setting of New Tokyo, devastated by natural disasters and crime, and the monstrous enemy robots called Cybots, free-thinking creatures that love destruction.From there, episode three starts a new side plot and also reveals the history of the story, how crime became so prevalent on the streets of Tokyo, and the police force known as RAPT that has taken control in more than one way. In this episode, the girls hunt an apparent psychopath who gets kidnapped, and they are forced to follow. Episode four continues this storyline and shows how multi-faceted the series will be, as this episode has action, comedy, drama, and even a little bit of horror. The climactic scene is a blood-fest that leaves you wanting more.Final impressions: action seems to be the important part in this series, and none of it is generic or recycled. It's mature enough to carry an adult along but still great for older teenagers.Other bonuses include a great western-style soundtrack, with a beginning theme song that's reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop's opening theme ""Tank."" The voice-acting is top notch, with voices familiar to most Funimation productions. And for those of you who love pointy breasts, this series has fan-service to no end. Plus, it actually has special features, a rare thing in anime DVDs, in the form of outtakes, a radio drama, and text-less songs, not to mention the small art-book that comes with the DVD.This series reminds me a lot of Bubblegum Crisis 2040, but with a mixture of Mezzo and Armitage along with it. I'd recommend Burst Angel to anyone who enjoyed these anime, or to fans of other Gonzo films.","Burst Angel, Vol. 1: Death's Angel"

When this picture was first shown at the Vilma Theater on Belair Rd. in Baltimore City there wasn't an empty seat in the house(the line outside was almost as long as it was for ""The Ten Commandments"" that premired a short time after King Creole). To start off I'm not sure how many folks know it but this was Elvis's favorite movie that he made. ""Crawfish,CCrrraaawwwfffiiissshhhh-gees I got'em"",boy if that doesn't make you feel like you are right on the Gulf, sharing plates with Cajuns and of course Creoles! Everything about this movie is first class: the Stars-Presly, Jagger,Mathouw,Jones and of course Vic Marrow as always the perfect Punk.The music is about the best Elvis ever did. I have had the original LP for about 40 years now and still play it for my grandchildren. Dixieland Rock,Trouble, Crawfish, King Creole this is some really good stuff and the fact that this music is backed up by a live Brass Blues Band makes it somewhat ""Outstanding"" not to mention that the back up vocals are done by no other then Gordon Stoker and the Jordonaires as they are right on stage with the King himself. If you want to see some real Hollywood History with a top notch cast (keep in mind Dean Jagger did this movie a year before he stared in ""White Christmas"" with Bing,Danny,Rosemary and Vera Ellen)and a first class plot with some great action and the REAL feel of being down in New Orleans (even if your not a real Cajun like Jimmie C Newman)get yourself a copy of this great show!""Enjoy""",King Creole VHS

518244,"Well, you see what happened was I met a new friend on-line and he noticed that I review things. His name is The Curmudgeon and I guess he is big over-seas. I think. Anyways, he reccommended a few things for me to review. I sent a member of my web-site team up to Video One to get the DVD and a pizza for me. I'm waiting right now. To use my time efficiently, I'm going to write another review somewhere else while I wait. I'll see you over at the Conan section of Amazon.com.Okay, I'm back and so is the movie. Er.....movieS I guess....Alright, there's a small problem. He wasn't sure which movie to get.....Says there were 2 different ones he was looking at. Uh-oh. The first one is pretty non-descript, and the other one is an Arnold Shwartsaneger movie. I have no way to get ahold of The Curmudgeon right now. The names ARE kind of similar...I guess it would be easy to confuse them.....Hmmm. I have an idea. Sounds like it's time for the first ever.....DUAL-REVIEW! The Arnold one is on DVD so I'm having these guys play it on a lap-top computer. Sadly enough, he says the other one was only available on Video-Tape. I'll put that one on the V.C.R. they have.Okay, computer on the left, TV (with V.C.R.) on the right. Alright, they're still setting up the DVD on the lap-top, so I started the V.C.R.......So far, so good. A monster-worm just flew out of a guy's mouth. I'm game.....Hmmmm....Black and White. Wonder if it will change to color like the movie with the girl, and the dog, and the lion, and the wizard, and.....Okay, the DVD is starting on my LEFT side...Ok, well THAT one is in color so it makes up for the RIGHT side's lack of color............Okay, a few minutes have passed. The LEFT side has some mild action stuff....the RIGHT side though, is pretty interesting. The main guy in it is walking out-side and WHOOPS! His foot goes right in a mud-puddle. Kind of reminds me of the Three Stooges by the way it looks. But without any hitting.Okay....after a while a LOT of action happened on the LEFT, with a really big gun. It's really hard to stop watching. But my eyes are drawn to the RIGHT side now. The guy is at a house and no one is talking to him and he seems uncomfortable. I can totally relate to this. I feel like that sometimes. The old lady looks dead. Wow, the dad at the table seems dangerously enthusiastic. Nobody really talks much and it's akward. Kind of like dinner at my place LOL. The LEFT side is in a boring part. The plot seems IMPOSSIBLE to follow. You know, it's kind of weird. I'm watching the RIGHT side more than the action-move on the LEFT! Okay, WOW! Look what's for dinner at the weird house. AMAZING. Let me watch for a few minutes.Okay, wow! How do I catch you guys up? Ummm, the LEFT side had a really crazy scene where Arnold is in a gunfight on an airplane and he jumps out and catches a parachute! And the plot is completely lost on me now. But the RIGHT side has blown my mind. There is a mutant-alien thing. But it doesn't look like either a puppet or a muppet. It looks...real. This is crazy. Give me a little while....Now the LEFT side has alligators! And another wild shoot-out, and EVERYTHING! The RIGHT side is a cloud-nightmare on earth. There is weird little worms and a chipmunk lady that sings, and the alien is out of control and just SCREAMING. I feel like this guy sometimes when I'm around the house with Morris (my dog) and I try to leave and he goes crazy and barks and barks until I come back. Okay, the LEFT side of the movie is...well, I guess you could call it ""pure-action"". If there really is a plot now, it does'nt matter. Arnold has a really big action-gun now. For all I know this is a Terminator sequel. Or prequel. Maybe. HOLY CRAP! On the RIGHT side, the guy that reminds me of me (I think his name might even be the same as mine) has completely been engulfed by his Cloud-Nightmare! He fought the alien, and if I tried to expain what happened next you wouldn't belive me. Some bratty little kid just stole his head and sold it to a pencil-factory. SEE! You don't believe me! I'm not even sure I believe it. WHAT!? I'm being bombarded by both movies at the SAME TIME!! I look to the LEFT, I see a HUGE gunfight with a HUGE gun in a boat-yard! I look RIGHT and I'm absolutely terrified by the chipmunk lady on the screen! Don't touch her! No! AAAAAAAA! Wow... the credits are playing now (RIGHT side only) with some herky-jerky organ music. It compiments the action on the LEFT side, strangely enough. Okay, LEFT side is done with action and almost over. Okay, it's over. That was incredibly rare.Jeez, you guys simply HAVE to try this. I'm not kidding. See what I did there? I didn't know which movie he wanted me to review, so in an amazing display of innovation, I have created a new reviewing medium. The Dual-Review style. It can serve many purposes. First off, it can enhance two mediocre movies to make a sort of super-movie. Secondly, it can save time on reviewing. I never imagined I could increase my productivity by DOUBLE! And third off, the reader (you guys) can benefit from the review because it's something they just can't get anywhere else. THIS is why I'm the reviewer of the future. I fascinate myself sometimes. Partial credit can be given to my friend, since he reccommended one of these movies, but I'm still not sure which one.

It was unfair in the extreme, incidentally, that only two of the three (Eddington & Hawthorne) were awarded OBE's for their performances, but poor Derek Fowlds wasn't.The scriptwriters excelled themselves, producing an absolutely fascinating insight into the world of British beuraucracy, yet managing a laugh a second.The production values were outstanding, as was the supporting cast.Even twentyfive years later, this serial remains entirely up-to-date, and could well have been written just last month.All-in-all, a rare gem, and a must-have for any DVD collection.","Yes, Minister/Yes, Prime Minister 2-Pak"

It is great.  I found the suspense was continued throughout the movie.  I am bored  easily but this movie was not what I had expected at all.  I love finding a gem in low budget!  I am currently re-watching the film with the commentary from the director and writer.  I don't know if you guys periodically check your reviews on Amazon, but thank you for a gem of a film.  As I said, I had heard great things of this film, and I am pleased to say they were true.",N/A
492758,"It's glossy, punchy and melodramatic. The fact that the women are beautiful is an added bonus! This 1959 remake of the original 1934 version probably appeals more to modern day sensibilities. Comparing both versions is inevitable - there are several differences, though the most obvious being the time.Hollywood Diva Lana Turner plays Lora, a struggling widowed actress and mother who, by chance, meets up with a fellow struggling widow, Annie, played adeptly by Juanita Moore. By now, the Aunt Jemima domestic ""Mammy"" image portrayed by Louise Beavers in the original version was deemed politically incorrect, but Juanita plays the dutiful housekeeper all the same. The daughters (played by Sandra Dee and Susan Khoner) hit it off straight away, although there's tension from Annie's pass-for-white daughter from the outset.We advance several years with the girls now in their teens. Lora's now made it as a glittering actress, and can now afford to live in the lap of luxury. Another major difference between this version and the original is that the relationship between the leading ladies is more intertwined. There's an on-screen chemistry that's electric, and it makes for compulsive viewing. Susi and Sarah Jane are like sisters - they practically grew up together. There's also a special bond between Susi and Annie. Indeed, Annie knew that Susi was in love long before her mother did.Although Lana Turner's the star of this movie, she was eclipsed by Juanita Moore and Susan Khoner, who both gave career-best acting performances. Sandra Dee packs a punch too, as the wide-eyed, but neglected Susie. There are some scenes that are heartbreaking, and you can feel Annie's anguish.  Sarah Jane's confused, restless and downright ungrateful! In the end, the viewer doesn't really care about 'Diva' Lora, and her enormous ego.There's something not quite right about the movie, though and it has nothing to do with the acting. I felt that Sarah Jane's character could have been explored in much more detail. It's 1959, on the verge of the Civil Rights movements. Sarah Jane's a beautiful and intelligent young woman who runs away from home and rejects her mother. For what?  So that she can become a dancer in some sleazy nightclub. Give me a break! This was a cop-out from the director who obviously had a very limited view on the capabilities of African Americans. Sure, racism was rife, but was dancing the only option for a young woman with Susi's capabilities?Never mind, what's done is done. I just feel the movie lacks the sincerity of the original in certain parts.The final scenes, like the original, pull out all the stops. Poor Annie - tired, worn and despairing - dies of a broken heart, and has the grandest of funerals, including a majestic, emotionally charged rendition from Gospel legend, Mahalia Jackson. Sarah Jane turns up and throws herself at the casket - just as Peola had done in the original. This is gripping stuff.Juanita Moore and Susan Khoner received Best Supporting Actress nominations for their roles - deservedly so. For years, everyone assumed that the role of Sarah Jane went to a white actress. CORRECTION! In reality, Susan Khoner was mixed-raced herself (part Mexican). Her own racial ambiguity no doubt gave her a valuable insight into Sarah Jane's character. Alas, like the beautiful Fredi Washington (who was typecast as the 'Tragic Mulatto'), Khoner had no blooming movie career after Imitation of Life. She will always be remembered for her outstanding performance in this movie.If you're undecided as to which version to get, I'd say get both and make up your own minds as to which version is better. A note to UK viewers - you'll need a VCR with NTSC playback to watch this movie.",Imitation of Life VHS

779909,"With high quality audio, beautiful visuals, and Peter Gabriel's usually awe-inspiring showmanship (an upside-down moonwalk?!), this DVD has everything. And yet, the performance comes across as a little flat. Sure, I have my qualms with the directorial decisions (why random shots of the crew chilling out during the song?). I think the biggest issue is that the material from ""Up"" lacks the '80s bounce of previous Peter Gabriel records. Also, a couple of the staple songs like ""Red Rain"" and ""In Your Eyes"" seem like they're just going through the motions. (Red Rain is also played way too slow, but that's another matter.) It's far more reflective, more of a superpowered artistic statement than a hopping concert. Only during ""Secret World"" and ""Solsbury Hill"" (and, of course, ""Sledgehammer"") can you feel one with that emotional eruption of a captivated, enchanted audience. Nevertheless, the lights and action of the show are very powerfully done and this mostly makes up for the lack of oomph.",N/A

852719,"Deserving of all the praise, this beautifully researched and executed film is a combination war film/docudrama that carefully and responsibly chronicles not only Hitler's final days as the Fuhrer, but the literal demise of the Third Reich as Berlin succombed to the Russian forces.The strengths of this marvelous, important film come not only in the detailed accuracy of its script but in the inspired detail in every department: cinematography, wardrobe, makeup, effects, sound and especially CASTING.  Every part is played to frightening perfection, especially (in my opinion) Speer, Eva Braun, the Goebbels family and, of course Bruno Ganz's amazing depiction of Hitler.The bonus features, while not plentiful, are worthy of the film itself and the director's commentary (in English) especially interesting and insightful.One to own and view in rememberance of the terrible time in our not-so-distant past.

166627,"Is Brando's performance as Terry Malloy in On The Waterfront the best screen performance of all time? Well I have never seen a better one. Watch this film and see why Brando was so highly rated. As the ex boxer turned longshoreman/borderline gangster, Brando gives a perfect performance. Yet Brando does not dominate the film, Karl Malden, Rod Steiger, Lee J Cobb and Eve Marie Saint all give marvelous performances, which but for Brando's would all be remembered as a high point of film acting. Malden, Cobb and Steiger were all nominated for the Oscar as best supporting actor.The story is about corruption on the Brooklyn Docks of the nineteen fifties. It is one of the few American films to portray the working class. The black and white shots of working class Brooklyn are the perfect background for a story of a loser struggling to do the right thing dispite the social pressures on him.Brando and Steiger in the back of the taxi cab is one of the greatest. if not the greatest, movie scene of all time.There is nothing false or overdone in this film. All to often in films and in life working class people are told that the way to success is to move out of their communities and leave them behind.  This film is about real people struggling not to leave their community, but to make that community better. Realism is everything in this film, the acting, the costumes, the sets, the story.  Even today the fight between  Brando and Cobb at the end of the film is shocking in it's realism.On the Waterfront must have a claim to be the best film ever made, it is certainly one of the best two or three American films ever made.Watch and enjoy a perfect film which will leave you gasping at the talent of everyone who had anything to do with it.",N/A

I wonder what Tom Clancy thinks about that. Muslims are just innocent bystanders, and the liberals save the day, because war is all just a misunderstanding, or is caused by European nazis. This movie is shameless political correctness. The film is actually excellent, but I give it only two stars for the tired leftwing cliches. If they had filmed it based on Clancy's novel, it would have been great. I think Hollywood just copped out and got scared of portraying the Muslims as ""the enemy"", and so did what they always do: just turn the bad guys into white nazis.

236489,"Connery was sort of the Johnny Depp of the Sixties/Seventies in that he was a handsome leading-man type who always was trying to break loose from the ""Bond"" straightjacket by choosing offbeat, interesting, ""challenging"" roles when he wasn't saving the world as 007. (The only place Connery wouldn't DARE go back then are the fey, semi-gay characters Depp will occasionally take on.  Sean had/has WAY too much ""Scottish Macho"" flowing through his veins to ""go gay""! It would be like John Wayne or Clint Eastwood playing gay!)  Anyway, he tackled this against-type role of rollicking, blue-collar poet Sampson Shillitoe. (Albeit, Gawd knows, Shillitoe is a strutting, bristlingly macho, overloaded-with-testosterone, thoroughly HETEROSEXUAL poet---sort of what Norman Mailer would be if he was a poet & not a prose writer.) When the role was somewhat customized in this way to suit Connery's screen persona, he succeeded in pulling off a bravura comic performance. As previous posters have mentioned, highlights are his hilariously disastrous, drunken recital at some high-society Ladies' Social Club & his explosive display of feeling-the-touch-of-God creative joy on the (Brooklyn?) Bridge.  The macho/near abusive attitudes toward women are now very dated (as they now are in the early ""Bond"" films), but the movie is definitely a keeper, a nearly-forgotten, flawed gem.",N/A

It explores three generations of mother-daughter relationships.This would be a great movie for any child of an abusive mother.Siddalee, the Sandra Bullock character, gradually comes to understand her grandmother and mother and is thus gradually able to forgive them.It is a frustrating movie. I found myself demanding the plot bound along with series of Hollywood contrivances, but it meanders and backtracks, tantalising then not delivering, much like real life.The unbearably aching mood of reconciliation and nostalgia gradually develops, partly due to the long suffering, ever-loving Shep Walker (James Garner in a low-profile role quite unlike the ones he normally plays), and Connor (Angus Macfadyen), Siddalee's ever-patient Irish boyfriend.Maggie Smith is in it, reason enough to go.The movie recreates the south in lush technicolor over three generations, a visual feast.If you are embarrassed to cry in public, make sure to watch this alone.",N/A

832737,"""Fractured Flickers"" was a noble if short-lived TV series of 1963-64 that ""fractured"" vintage silent movies with humorous voices, narration, and sound effects. Those who like their silent movies uncut and in the proper context should be warned: the irreverent scripts are often hilarious, and the show is paced so quickly that some of the jokes are just blackouts, with edits lasting just a few seconds.Hans Conried is outstanding as the live-action host; he uses his cultured diction and dignified bearing for maximum comic effect, especially when he makes snide and self-conscious remarks about the show itself! Conried also chats on camera with guest stars, many of whom enter into the spirit of the show: Rod Serling, Edward Everett Horton, Pat Carroll, and especially Conried impersonating a beatnik for Bob Denver's benefit are memorable.The voice-over cast consists of only three actors: Paul Frees, Bill Scott, and June Foray, all versatile and all familiar from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons. Some of the offbeat voices are surprising, like Scott's impersonation of Bob Newhart; Newhart actually appears on one of the later shows to protest!This set contains all 26 episodes of the series, which should probably be watched one or two at a time. The format does get repetitive and the hectic, bang-bang-bang pacing could possibly wear an audience out after an extended viewing. The show's treatment of dramatic footage is obviously better than its handling of comedy footage (Buster Keaton, who appears frequently, doesn't need voice-overs to be funny). But the new twists on the old films are often ingenious, and the show is definitely of interest to Bullwinkle fans and old-movie buffs. Technical quality is excellent except for episode #1, which has audio problems (no fault of the DVDs, that's how the surviving elements are).",Fractured Flickers - The Complete Collection

I did not grow up in America and do not know how it feels to hate other races, but I often felt hopeless being caught between black and white in times of conflicts since I am neither black nor white.The change in this film sadly cost them one of their lives. I think any time a change occurs there is a friction, and the friction can be extremely sad as a result.Also, the film reminded me of the fact that we all cannot escape Karma - a consistency of cause and effect. One kills someone, and that action will eventually comes back to him or her. I am not a Buddhist, but the consistency of cause and effect is there no matter who we are.

925858,"Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE (is this a double entendre about the star?) is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep - you put it in the DVD slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day. And it works for that for that purpose: being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more.The story is a rather simple one about a wife Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) married to an increasingly distant husband Sam (Jimi Mistry) who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice. His partner Archie (Dougray Scott) is fond of both Sam and Alice, but has a longtime attraction to Alice that goes beyond friendship. Alice pals with her sister Felicity (Kate Miles), a free love advocate, who encourages Alice to have affairs. On Valentine's Day, after a drinking binge with her sister, Alice mails a card to Sam signed 'Anonymous' as a test to see if Sam responds, testing his fidelity. At the same time Archie mails a radish seed packet to Alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not. Both have ex post facto regrets. Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya (Branka Katic) and is indeed cheating on Alice. Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in disguise as 'Anonymous' to test his fidelity. The entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth - and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise (of sorts) of the fluffy script.British comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting. Perhaps had director John Hay elected to cast a British actress as Alice instead of pasting a phony accent on Jennifer Love Hewitt the result may have been improved. But in the end this story by Peter Bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages. One terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive. There are some nice scenes of London and a few moments of passable humor, but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music/white noise. Grady Harp, October 05",N/A

900771,"STRANGE BEDFELLOWS is one of those films that plays like a TV sitcom without the canned laughter - especially now that gay themed shows have made it big on television.  This film's main charm is its Aussie flavor and that forgives a lot of the shortcomings of a fluffy idea of a script.Essentially, two men (Paul Hogan and Michael Caton) decide to avoid back taxes and take advantage of a new law that allows same sex partners to gain the rights of married couples by passing as a gay married couple.  How they go about convincing each other that they can pass as gay in order to convince the authorities and then how they can learn to act gay and live a gay life to back up their story is the action of the movie.  Many stereotypes are included but somehow the Aussies know how to pull this off with minimal offense.The overall theme, after the story is all said and done, is one of tolerance and compassion for people who are in different societal climes.  Hogan and Caton pull this off well, showing how really everyone they meet in their charade is just a 'regular guy' - and for that reason the film becomes more tolerable than the usual farces that deal with 'passing'.

83817,"Nancy - that woman on the cover - she's just a nice, honest girl who takes off her clothes for a living. Just about no one else is that easy to place.This movie is the best in a lot of different directions. For one, it's at the top of the new noir. Everything and everyone has a dark edge; the good guys have a bad edge, and the bad guys have a really bad edge, and some of them are just over over the edge. Just about every scene is night, a dark time for the dark businesses of murder and revenge. And best, this isn't just one story, it's three or four that wind together.It's also probably the best comic book adaptation ever. The comic's original writer and artist, Frank Miller, was co-director, and he brought these stories to their dark, gritty life the way it needed to be done. The actors put in some memorable performances, too - Elijah Wood's ""Kevin"" is no hobbit, not even a little. The script is close to the original, but the visuals are so true to Miller's chiaroscuro art that it's incredible.This is also one of the most creative, pointed uses of color in any movie I've ever seen. It's black and white, with the emphasis on the black - like the characters themselves, there's not a lot of gray in the middle. That makes every spot of color matter, starting with that first red dress and soft mouth full of red lipstick. Goldie's hair, Cindy's eyes, that yellow b*st*rd, and blood. Lots of blood. Sometimes, though the blood turns black as death, or glows white like molten metal - the color (or lack) conveys the mood better than literality ever could.It's not for the squeamish, though. The hookers and strippers do their work out of sight, but the violence gets pretty raw. It's a raw story, though.And it's great.

960582,"This collection of David Lynch's short films was originally only available through his Web site. This new edition is reportedly the same disc with different packaging (it lacks the oversized box and booklet of the first version), but it's considerably cheaper. You can watch each film with or without an introduction by Lynch. The films are:SIX MEN GETTING SICK - This animated one-minute movie was Lynch's very first film. It was originally part of a multi-media piece and was projected over a sculpture on a continuously running loop. The title is an accurate description of the film, as several human heads become inflamed, catch fire, and vomit copiously. It's worth noting that, while 99.9% of movie directors become filmmakers because they're into films, Lynch came to filmmaking purely as an extension of his painting, and was never a movie buff. I think that simple fact goes a long way in explaining Lynch's originality as a director.THE ALPHABET - A combination of animation and live action, this approximately 5-minute film is ""about the fear of learning,"" according to Lynch. The soundtrack consists of children repeatedly chanting the alphabet, while animated letters seem to excrete and procreate and a woman in white-face cowers in a bed and eventually vomits blood (vomiting figures strongly in Lynch's early film work). It's a concentrated and eerie piece of surrealism.THE GRANDMOTHER - A lonely, abused boy grows a grandmother from a seed in this, Lynch's first attempt at narrative (of a sort). There's some animation, but live action dominates. It's crudely made in comparison to his first feature, Eraserhead, but it's clearly the product of the same singular artistic vision.THE AMPUTEE - Back around the time he was making ERASERHEAD, Lynch was offered some videotape for free, so he used it to shoot this short bit of black comedy. It stars Catherine Coulson (much later she became the Log Lady in TWIN PEAKS) and Lynch himself.THE COWBOY AND THE FRENCHMAN - Made for French TV right after he finished BLUE VELVET, this is a virtually plotless exercise in comic surrealism, plopping down an absurdly stereotypical Frenchman (he wears a beret, and carries a bottle of wine and snails in briefcase) in the middle of a ranch inhabited by several stereotypical cowboys. It looks like it was mastered off a videotape source, which is odd. I wonder  if the original film elements were lost.LUMIERE - Originally titled PREMONITION FOLLOWING AN EVIL DEED, which I personally like a lot better than LUMIERE. This was made for the film LUMIERE AND COMPANY, in which acclaimed directors from all over the world were given a Lumiere camera (the very first motion picture camera) and asked to make a movie with it. Since the camera could only hold 55 seconds worth of film, the directors were retsricted to that running time. They also were not allowed to edit. If you've seen LUMIERE AND COMPANY, you know that Lynch's film is by far the most interesting and imaginative of the bunch. He ingeniously got around the prohibition against editing by constructing several sets side-by-side, and blocking the lens momentarily while he moved the camera to the next scene. The movie goes by in a flash of bizarre black and white images. Was that a naked woman floating in a huge glass tube? And what were those humanoid things and what exactly were they doing? You have to watch the film several times to begin to get a clear idea of what you've seen.These shorts represent the more abstract side of Lynch's film work - they're much more the work of the Lynch who made ERASERHEAD than the Lynch who made THE STRAIGHT STORY. Your average Joe Filmgoer would hate them. But if you're a Lynch fan and haven't seen some or all of these films, you'll definitely want to get this.",The Short Films of David Lynch
819344,"I found this film mildly gripping until the last act, and then I was sickened. Perhaps I was more sympathetic to Tim Robbins' character's sincere efforts to control his urges than I was to Sean Penn's manic rages, but one need not be conflicted to sense that something is morally and ethically amiss. There is never really any doubt (at least for the audience) of Dave Boyle's innocence of the murder of Jimmy Marcus's daughter, yet Marcus' thuggish character over-rides any such concerns. Marcus coerces a ""confession"" from Boyle after telling him he will let him live, and then once Marcus' pre-conceived notion is thus confirmed, he kills Boyle anyways. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) shows up just in time to tell Marcus that he has killed an innocent man, and Marcus' reaction can be summed as a ""so what.""  The end of the film doesn't ask any gray moral or ethical questions--quite the contrary. Devine and Marcus wave and smile at each other, as if justice was served--the daughter was an innocent, Boyle was innocent, and they're both dead. It all ""evens out"" in some warped way. The pathetic Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) the only person who apparently cared if Boyle lived or died, is left unnoticed and marginalized. The last ten minutes of the film, thus, makes what transpired before filmmaking mendacity.What exactly was the message Clint Eastwood was trying to convey here? The only one that makes sense to me is  Dirty Harry-type vigilantism where colateral damage is a fact of life is acceptible under certain situations. I, frankly, find such reasoning appalling.",N/A

876471,"I was looking through my local video store and was excited to find a movie about Stu U ! I read mnay things about him on the internet and his lifestory was so interesting that a film about his life would be very interesting as well. Sadly, this movie didn't come close to revealing the passion that was stu. His grief and anguish in this film was but a small glimpse of a real man with more profound emotions than the character who played him. The movie felt like it was on the peripheral rather than really facing the man, Stu U. In short the character didn't do justice to him nor did the script. Stu was a brilliant man but they never showed his intellect the way he deserved. Rather, they portrayed him as a very good Gin player, which he was, with a foul mouth and bad manners. I believe he wasn't as naive and childish as they made him out to be in the movie. I wish they focused less on his childhood, which comprised a decent portion of the film, and more on his poker games as well as his demons .",High Roller - The Stu Ungar Story
252989,"I'm old enough to recall the 1966 previews, aired on ABC, for a mid-season replacement series based on the longstanding comic hero, ""Batman"". The trailer just hinted at what the show was about: a masked crime fighter, driving a souped-up car unlike anything coming out of Detroit, and a mystique that served to pique interest in the series.But, when the show hit, it hit BIG! Wednesday and Thursday nights were its domain, having hold on the 7:30 - 8:00 time period for two of its three years aired.This disc is the film adaptation of the series, made during the first year hiatus, as explained by stars Adam West and Burt Ward in the DVD's commentary. The movie features the same supporting cast, as did the series (Neil Hamilton as ""Commissioner Gordon,"" Stafford Repp as ""Chief O'Hara,"" and Alan Napier as devoted manservant ""Alfred""). Also rounding out the cast are frequent ""guest villains"" Frank Gorshin (""The Riddler""), Caesar Romero (""The Joker""), Burgess Meredith (""The Penguin"") and new ""Catwoman"" Lee Meriweather, who replaced Julie Newmar, unavailable due to previous theatrical commitments.The movie also has the series' trademark comic book action ""sounds"" (""POW!"" ""BANG!"" ""ZOWIE!"" et. al.), the gaudy colors (brought to life in vivid Technicolor), the crazy sound effects, and the tongue-in-cheek dialogue and winks that made the show so cool.Speaking of the color, I couldn't help but be taken as to how great the set pieces look, even those ""recycled"" from other shows filmed on the Fox lot. As one whose household didn't get a color set until after the show's end, this DVD allows me to see what I had been missing. Granted, I did have the View Master reel set of the show but it was just an ""appetizer"" to how ""Batman"" really looked on screen.Best of the DVD extras is a four-minute ""visit"" with George Barris, the designer of The Batmobile. It's not long on info, but any chance to look at what is perhaps the best ""ride"" to come across the big or small screen is cause for celebration.",N/A

874423,"This was the very first pre-recorded video I ever purchased way back in 1979. At that point in time, video stores did not even exist and I had to purchase it through the mail via a long-defunct company called, The Videotape Network. They also sold The Best of Ernie Kovacs and The Beatles Live in Tokyo. At the time I was thrilled to have actual moving images of Lenny Bruce who, due to the nature of his material, was not often in front of the camera - film, television or otherwise. In hindsight the film leaves a little bit to be desired because of the fact that Fred Baker, a good filmmaker, uses alot of unrelated material to illustrate Lenny's  recorded bits - not that he had any other choice. Since then, a far superior film has been made that was shown briefly in  New York City and on HBO about five or six years ago, Lenny Bruce: Swear To Tell The Truth. For some reason that film has yet to be released on DVD or VHS. Untill that happens this film is your best bet. You won't be disappointed.Tom DeganGoshen, NY",Lenny Bruce Without Tears

I thought it was great.  I loved how Nick Cannon had the opportunity to show his charismatic personality in the guitar scene.  I didn't like his hair either way he styled it, but I liked his transformation.  His friends were realistically nerdy (not over the top--minus the entrance to the car scene) and the story fell into place nicely.Steve Harvey was funny as usual and Christina Milian played her part quite nicely.

228942,"Fiesty Federal Investigator is hot on the trail of a husband-killer, but to catch her she has to think like the killer thinks and play her game...I would love to see a rematch of these two dynamite femme stars, Debra Winger and Theresa Russell. The movie world needs them. Russell, as an actress, generally lacks Winger's inner-fire, but some of her close-ups are more revealing than her dialogue anyway(watch for the scene on the beach after the scuba diving accident). In 1987, this was considered a modest hit which got generally good reviews(Roger Ebert panned it, however). So it's fair to say the movie is highly underrated and should be seen by anyone who loves a good mystery or a great acting match between two top-flight stars. Supporting performances are also very good, and the direction is tricky & tight right up until the final scene(which seems a little rushed). Great cinematography, suspenseful music by Michael Small, incredible Winger & Russell!",Black Widow VHS
996874,"Hellsing is perhaps the best anime I've seen since Cowboy Bebop. It has action, mysterious characters, and a soundtrack that can compete with Cowboy Bebop. The main theme is simple enough. The Hellsing Family of Great Britian has guarded the Royal Family for hundreds of years from vampires and ghouls and other supernatural creatures. The family is currently head by Sir Integra Hellsing (a woman, I swear) who has the ultimate trump card: a vampire of her own. She ressurected the vampire Alucard, who serves her and hunts vampires for Hellsing. At the start of the series, Alucard rescues a young police girl named Seras, and makes her a vampire in his service. Through the course of the series they discover more and more about a plot by another organization that is creating ""artificial"" vampires. The series ends with Alucard fighting the strongest of them, Incognito (yes, the name is funny.)What really makes the series is Alucard, who it is suggested is Dracula. He takes great pride in what he is, and finds the freak vampires to be disgusting abominations. Through the show, the viewer gets the impression that Alucard is bored. He spends his time trying to find a worth opponent that he can go all out against. He finds this in the form of Father Anderson, a Paladin working for a secret Vatican organization, and Incognito. But still, one feels sorry for the vampire because he is so alone. He had wiped out most of his race and can find no enjoyment in missions anymore.Seras is a less likeable character at the start though. She has what I call ""Anne Rice Vampire Syndrome"" where she feels so conflicted about drinking blood and leaving her home. She does get over it, but very late in the series. The other characters are much more impressive like Integra, Anderson, and Walter, Integra's retainer. He seems like a nice old guy, but he's as ruthless as Alucard.I really enjoyed Hellsing, but apparently Japan did not, since it was never that popular. It felt to me like the series was expected to continue, since there are so many plot holes left at the end. The ending notes seemed really tacked on, and there is so much that suggests a second season was intended. I really wish that it was, since the show could have only gotten better. The manga answers many questions, but in a way that seems cheap. But this is good DVD reguardless. The dubbing is well done, and the subtitles are accurate. The price is worth it, and if you get really into it, check out the manga.",Hellsing: Complete

76901,"Plot: A cyborg from the 2029 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has arrived in the present (which, for the sake of the film, is 1984).

You see, in this seemingly hopeless future, there will be a man who is capable of leading an army that conquers the machines. The cyborg must terminate the mother of that child -- Sarah Connor. Also sent back in time is the ""good guy"" of the story -- Reese. Reese has been sent ot protect Sarah from the cyborg, to be sure the child is eventually born. But, even with Sarah's natural determination to live and Reese's passion for his duty, the incredibly advanced humanoid machine will be one tough cookie to beat! Can they terminate the terminator? Will our future ever be safe from the rise of the machines?A wonderful storyline, a heart-pounding score, great direction by James Cameron, and an overall grim feeling of futuristic mayhem are just a few of the aspects of The Terminator that make it a scifi classic. Is it Schwarzenegger on screen with his mechanical brutality that attracts so many? Or maybe the terrifying ride along with Reese and Sarah trying to escape this madness? Maybe we'll never really know why this is such an amazing movie.

23331,"For his first film, Director Michael Bay took production to Miami like a bull in a china shop.  The perfectionist film maker supposedly ruffled many feathers with his demands and `do-it-my-way' approach.Despite the rumors, and they are just rumors which are usually based on disproportionate facts, Bay had Jerry Bruckheimer in his corner and was able to get it done.  Even back in 1994 when Bruckheimer was merely a Producer Czar, and not quite the Producer Deity that he is today he was able to get sections of busy streets closed off and complete shooting schedules approved on location in Miami.  Bay went on to help Bruckheimer became even more influential with a string of blockbuster action hits; The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor.To emphasize the point, Bay really does know what he's doing when it comes to making movies.  Bad Boys being his first film, he certainly wanted to do it right.  The SE DVD explains much of this as he worked with Lawrence and Smith to get the most out of the characters as well as the sets.  He actually paid for an entire scene (several thousand dollars) on the basis that he believed the movie needed it and would get it back if the movie made enough at the box office.  It did, and he got his money back and then some.Now to focus on the movie itself.  It's a buddy cop movie at the core, but it's different in that both characters are black.  The script was originally written for Dana Carvey and John Lovitz, which would have made it a much different movie.  As with many scripts, parts are usually written with the assumption that a white person would play the role but could easily be played by a black person.  Samuel L. Jackson has won many roles by pointing out this oversight.  It's a refreshing change compared to many movies because not only are they black but Lawrence and Smith do a superb job of characterizing two very different people.  Lawrence play Det. Marcus Burnett, a working man's cop.  He's married with kids and a house.  Will Smith, in his first action flick, plays Det. Mike Lowrey, a somewhat self centered ladies man who was left a large trust fund by his parents (we're never told what happened to them).  He drives a Porsche, wears silk shirts and lives in an art deco condo on Bayside.  The two play off each other with skill in being very black sometimes but at the same time, very funny.  They have deep chemistry that comes off as a partnership/friendship that goes back a long way.The plot centers around the two Vice Detectives as they try to find out who stole their largest bust of heroine.  The fear of political repercussion of someone taking the fall for the screw up gives them a time limit.  As Marcus and Mike hit the street one of the thieves squanders some of the heroine and gets himself killed by the mastermind of the operation, Fouchet (Tch&eacute;ky Karyo).  In the process, an expensive call girl and her friend, Julie (T&eacute;a Leoni) are caught in the crossfire.  Only Julie survives.  What happens next is a case of mistaken Identity that cannot explained in a short sentence or two.  Suffice to say, it provides the movie with many moments of comic relief.As things unfold the action scenes become more energenic.  The cinematography and use of slow motion are used to their full potential.  This is where Michael Bay shines, in the look of the film.  The lobby shoot out/foot chase provides the best action sequence of the movie with many shots of Smith that glimpse into his future stardom.  The ending action scenes are a great climax.This movie is a stellar introduction piece of work.  It has some flaws but none that are glaring.  The infusion of life into the buddy cop movie was badly needed and this movie does it in large doses.",N/A

392129,"Jack Clayton's film of Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw"" is second only to ""The Haunting"" as the most effective and eerie ghost story put on film. Brilliantly photographed by Freddie Francis and superbly acted by Deborah Kerr, Pamela Franklin (""Hell House"") and Martin Stephens (""Village of the Damned""), Clayton's film starts off as an idyllic glimpse into the life of a new governess Miss Giddens (Kerr) taking care of two children Flora and Miles(Franklin and Stephens)for an indifferent uncle (Michael Redgrave). Isolated on the uncle's country estate, it soon becomes clear that something is not right with the children and that Giddens wasn't told everything about the death of their previous governess. Giddens begins to suspect that the children are being guided or possessed by two spirits but to what end she's not sure. Or is it all in her head and due to her repressed Victorian sexuality? Director Clayton and writers William Archibald (who worked on Hitchcock's ""I Confess"") and Truman Capote keep you guessing.Updated for Blu-ray Review (German Import):The Blu-ray is region A and B compatible.The Blu-ray of ""The Innocents"" looks exceptional good and, with the exception of one shot, is an immaculate transfer (the one scene has a hair that inexplicably appears at the bottom of the frame). Blacks are rock solid and the detail is remarkably good with nice depth as well.The audio is presented in its original mono. The only issue with the German import is that you have to choose English as the audio option as it defaults to German. Subtitles are in English and German.Where the disc shines are the special features. We get an audio commentary track from film scholar Sir Christopher Frayling that covers a wide variety of material from the original source material to the details of shooting and reception of the film.Only the anamorphic scope presentation of the film is on the Blu-ray (not the full screen and widescreen like the Fox domestic DVD).Frayling also holds a nearly half hour featurette that focuses on much of the same material and includes Frayling shot on the estate where the film is set.Some of the special features played with a bit of difficulty at first (which surprised me)but, if you hold the enter button (longer than usual) you'll be able to get access to them. Don't be discouraged the first time if, when you hit the enter button, it just restarts the main menu. The interface is a bit awkward at times.There's also an audio reading of the original book by Henry James (but in German) as well as a featurette on the costume designers and trailers for both the film and other titles put out by Capelight Pictures the label responsible for the release. There is also reversable cover art with a replica of the original German poster.Overall, this is a well done release with a very nice looking transfer of the film (the BFI UK transfer of the film) as well as numerous special features.It's a pity that Fox thinks so little of this release that they won't put it out in the U.S. on Blu-ray.Original Fox DVD:Fox has done a nice job in transferring this classic to DVD. ""The Innocents"" appears for the first time in an anamorphic widescreen transfer. Curiously, the pan and scan version (which is what I originally saw on TV) is on the A side of the flipper while the superior anamorphic widescreen transfer is on the B side. The film shows quite a bit of wear and tear at the beginning but be patient as the image quality improves at the film moves along. The rich grays, black and white imagery look marvelous throughout most of the presentation. I am disappointed by the extras. Fox has provided commentary tracks for many of their film noirs. Since Franklin is still around (and, at the time of this writing so is Kerr)as is Stephens, I'd think that they would consider adding a commentary track for the film. A featurette on the making of the film would also have been nice. Unfortunately, it seems that no one at Fox values this film in the same fashion as the folks at Warner Home Video did ""The Haunting"" a perfect companion piece to this classic. We do get the original theatrical trailer as well as Fox Flix recommendations for other ""horror"" movies. Remade at least at least four occasions (with the 1999 TV version a solid entry as well), this is the best of the films made from James' novel.Like Robert Wise's classic film ""The Haunting"", ""The Innocents"" is disquieting. The strong performances by the British cast and visually stunning direction keeps the film interesting throughout the production. The pacing is slow like many ghost stories creating tension and a sense of unease due to the unusual camera angles and visuals. Unlike many thrillers today, ""The Innocents"" doesn't resort to simple tricks like gore or violence. Instead Clayton uses sound effects and unusual camera tricks to create the tension that drives this thriller. If you come to this film expecting ""Scream"" you'll be sadly disappointed. The film that is nearest to this classic in tone is Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" which was clearly influenced by ""The Innocents"".Now the only other film I'm waiting on to show up on DVD is Robert Mulligan's film of Tom Tryon's novel ""The Other"". It's a good of example of how creepy thrillers used to be made with intelligence and style. Sadly, there's no DVD release announced yet for ""The Other"" or another film I admire (although it's flawed)""The Fool Killer"".",The Innocents VHS
849406,"This is the worst season of Buffy. I wish it weren't so. I wish it were the best season, but I cannot lie. It is the worst, including the first season in which the show had not truly yet found its voice. (And fellow Buffy fans, before you blast me, keep in mind that *some* season has to be the worst one. ;)And yet, I still rate it (and with no qualms) 5 Stars, for that is what it deserves. That should give you some idea of the quality of the show, entire.Specifically as regards the Seventh Season, it has a few great episodes (Selfless, Conversations with Dead People, Storyteller and the grand finale, Chosen) and a few which go awry (though Him is way underrated). The problems of the Seventh Season mainly occur in the last quarter, and they seem to stem from the fact that the production team learned of the series' impending end a little too late to prepare for it adequately. And so, we have some too-convenient plot devices (like the 'Scythe' and Guardian) and some elements ignored all-together (Buffy won't choose Dawn, huh?). Some of the later episodes, like Empty Places, seem to be just killing time.And yet the show never loses its wonderful characters, acting, writing, directing or dialogue. And the ending does truly befit a show that has been 5 Star all the way. It is majestic, sweeping, fitting, touching, triumphant, heroic.Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the greatest television show of all time. Read my reviews of each season, if you'd like.

928375,"This is yet another fine Kino Video production of a deluxe 2-disc edition featuring more silent comedy by one of the era's foremost comedians, Harold Lloyd.  It follows the first excellent Kino Video DVD, ""The Harold Lloyd Collection"" (Vol 1) which features the one-hour ""Grandma's Boy"" and seven shorter comedies.  In this second volume there is even more to enjoy, with six short pre-1920 comedies on the first disc, and four longer films on the second disc from 1920-21 which show Lloyd's quick development in a few short years; each film being different in its own way, and showcasing the versatility and wide range of themes Lloyd offered his audiences.  Although ranked alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, it was Harold Lloyd who attracted the biggest audiences and box office successes in the early 1920s, and it's high time, therefore, that his films are finally seeing the light of day again.For those who don't already know:  Harold Lloyd is pretty much an ordinary guy - unlike Chaplin whose trademark was his clown-like Tramp image, for instance, and his style is less slapstick than Chaplin and Arbuckle, but like Keaton and other silent film comedians, his strength also lies in athletic and even acrobatic ability.  Being silent films, early comedies relied heavily on physical action and gags, and Harold Lloyd set a pace to rival Keaton and others, especially in the action-packed films on disc 2 like ""High and Dizzy"" and ""Never Weaken"".  Some of the scenes taking place on high-rise ledges and scaffolding kept me on the edge of my seat holding my breath, while at the same time admiring the skills required to do such thrilling scenes in the early 1920s.  There are many other thrills and surprises, and I particularly appreciate Kino Video's choice of films, presenting great variety on each disc:  from barroom action in a Western (""Two Gun Gussie"") to backstage antics in ""Ring Up the Curtain"" and adventures on the high seas on an all-girl pirate ship in ""Captain Kidd's Kids"".  All of these films have the classic silent comedy formula of a boy, (Lloyd) a girl (Bebe Daniels in the early films, then Mildred Davis) and a third person; either a rival or a bad guy, and while this format is usually predictable, the rest of the plot is always a surprise.  All these films are a real pleasure to watch all these decades later, especially due to very good picture quality and outstanding original piano score by Donald Sosin, whose silent film accompaniment is always a cut above the rest.",N/A
892847,"This was a groundbreaking show when it aired on Fox in 1996.  And it was one of that network's early wrongful cancellations - more recent examples being Firefly, The Inside and Greg the Bunny.

The people who worked on it knew they were doing something special.  Unfortunately, Fox is the network of the mundane - special has no place.

737895,"This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish.  It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp.  Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot.  George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on ""The A-Team"".  Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture.  It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill.  Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy.  The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular).  If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow.",N/A
910163,"I recently purchased this DVD on Amazon.  I couldn't believe that the film makers were so stupid to put out a Director's Cut edition that was so much shorter than the original release that I decided I would just buy the longer one.Well over the Labor Day weekend I watched it.At first I really enjoyed it.  It had a lot of violence and fighting kind of like Gladiator or Braveheart.  However, the further it got into the movie the more I was wishing I had just gotten the Director's Shortened Version.There were several places where it starts on a tangent and then just stops and goes back and nothing else is said about it.  In other places it goes ahead and takes the tangent and doesn't achieve anything by including the tangent.  This motion picture, needed to be extensively redone mainly to give it some continuity and also to take out alot  of the unnecessary gay sex things and other type parts of the story that should never have been presented in this type of film.Over all the orignal version sucked.  I have not yet seen the Director's Cut.  I don't really know that I want to waste another 2.75 hours of this crap.",Alexander

832398,"With THE EYE being among my favorite scary movies ever, I was looking forward to this film with both excitement and trepidation.  The promising side was that the Pang Brothers helmed this film as well, rather than turning it over to someone else.  But we know how sequels tend to go, especially if the original cast does not return.As it turns out, that isn't a problem, because THE EYE 2 is a sequel only in the most general sense.  It, too, concerns a woman who begins seeing ghosts.  (The literal translation of both films' original title - JIAN GUI - is ""Seeing Ghosts."")  Otherwise, this film is completely unrelated.  Joey Cheng (Shu Qi - THE TRANSPORTER, GORGEOUS) is an outwardly tough but emotionally fragile young woman who has just ended a relationship with a married man.  After a failed suicide attempt she starts to see phantoms wherever she goes -- in particular, one ghostly woman who seems to be following her around.In some ways, THE EYE 2 is a better film than its predecessor.  It's not as frightening (though it has its moments) but it strives to be something more than a straight-ahead thriller.  It's about a woman facing an unwanted, unexpected pregnancy alone.  It delves into eastern philosophy and themes of karma and reincarnation.  It's just a different movie altogether, and viewers should go in expecting that.  The distinctive style of the Pang Brothers is still ever-present.Lion's Gate has released a nice DVD package of this film.  Extras include a thirteen-minute behind-the-scenes feature which sheds light on the creators' intentions and trailers for AUDITION, INFECTION, PREMONITION, JU-ON, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS and more.  The movie looks and sounds fantastic (5.1 surround is strongly suggested if you have it available.)Since both films are independent stories, you don't need to watch them in any particular order, but both are recommended.",N/A

523139,"After looking at all my reviews I realized that this review does the film no justice and I just emphasize my fasination with anything Russell Crowe so I've decided to rewrite my review if in hopes to help a few appreciate a great and wonderful film.My original review:First of all I decided to write my review for Gladiator today and I pulled it up and now I just have to say I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE RELEASING AN EXTENDED VERSION TO THIS MOVIE!!!  Now that I said all that...This movie introduced me to Russell Crowe.  I've been hooked ever since.  My wife says I'm obsesive, but who can blame me.  In this film Russell glows, he reaks of star, he oozes forward with OSCAR written all over him...Yes, there are other films that Russell owned, like A Beautiful Mind and the recent Cinderella Man, but this is what really got him noticed.  The story here is quite good for an action film, considering most action films lack (there are a few exceptions, like Armegedon & The Matrix for example)  There is pure emotion portrayed here by the entire cast, but notibly moreso in Crowe and Phoenix...The movie is quite gory, but please don't let that hinder you from watching this film...Ridley Scott brilliantly placed this film together and made one of the best films I've ever seen.  The battle's and fights are amazing and very well put together...everything about this film is eye catching.  I would recommend to anyone.  You won't be dissapointed.And now, my new review:Maximus (Crowe) is a loyal general of the Roman army, a man devoted to serving his country, a man who left behind his loved ones to serve the Emperor Marcus Arelious (I know I butchered the spelling)...theres just one problem and that problem is the Emperor's some Comodus (Phoenix) who wants rulership after his fathers death, and since his father is unwilling to do so, wanting the Roman empire to fall back to the ways of the Senate, Comodus murders his father in order to attain rule.  After doing so he has Maximus taken out to be exicuted.  Maximus of course escapes and upon returning home finds his wife and son have been murdered.  The week and tired soilder then collapses and is found by traveling merchants as sold as a gladiator to fight in the Roman games Comodus has decided to throw in rememberence of his late father.  Here is Maximus's chance for vengence, and vengence he will have.  The film is spot on with a tight script and impressive acting on all fronts, a film that delivers solid action with an emotinal sucker punch.  Much praise for Crowe who gives us a look at an amazingly strong man, one who can rise above what he's been redused to in order to free himself from the pain.  Amazing and powerful film!",Gladiator VHS

766664,"OK, here's how it all started for me. About a month ago in the Kansas City Star, I read a review of this interesting-looking movie I'd seen previews to called SERENITY. (""How cool to see a sci-fi movie with a title named after our ultimate goal in my N.A. group,"" I thought.) The guy reviewing the movie is GUSHING over it, admitting out loud it's hard for him to give a completely unbiased review of the movie, since he's a die-hard fan of the TV series it was based on. Up to this point, I'd only heard the title ""Firefly"" bandied about on occasion...seeing it in TV Guide, hearing the occasional reference to it in my chat room, etc. About the only TV I watch on a regular basis are the classic series that are found on both HBO and FX--the other channels held little if any interest for me. So, after reading the KC Star reviewer ranting about the Firefly series, implying it was the sci-fi equivalent of the Second Coming of Christ, I thought I'd put it on my Netflix list and check it out. I remember thinking, ""Well, if it's as good as STAR TREK and STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, I'll be impressed.God, was I ever impressed.The TV series box set all arrived in the space of one week, and I ended up watching them all in the space of 4 days. I couldn't put one disc in and just watch one episode...I was fished in like a spawning trout and had to watch the entire thing, start to finish. Hooked, hooked, HOOKED. I loved everything about this show from the get-go. The cast: It was cool to see the familiar faces of Ron Glass and Adam Baldwin, but even cooler to get acquainted with the others who were unfamiliar to me. 9 very, very gifted actors who, for all intents & purposes, appeared BORN to play these roles. I could rant about them all individually, but I'd be sitting here for another hour. You get the message. The acting: Matter of opinion here, but I think they pulled it off effortlessly. They BECAME their characters in the fashion of true method actors. When actors make their jobs look completely natural and effortless, they are achieving their goals magna cum laude. The stories: They pull you in immediately, the same way Stephen King and others like him pull you in right from the first few pages instead of taking forever with plot set-up and character study. Some of the more cynical among us would argue that the stories got a bit corny on occasion. To that I would argue, hey, even the best sci-fi TV shows and movies would occasionally tread into that territory (I have yet to forgive the NEXT GENERATION series for coming up with the episode where Data tried to become a stand-up comedian with the help of Joe Piscopo...or in the original STAR TREK where they took on the group of outer-space ""hippies""...) Sometimes corniness can be the right kind of comic relief at the right time within a story; whether it works or not is subject to anyone's opinion. Personally, I don't think they ever crossed the line where that was concerned. The humor in the stories was a godsend, and the vast majority of the time, very well-done and thought out...and as I stated in my review of the movie, it was even more pronounced throughout the movie.I could go on about other nuances of the series that grabbed me or tell you about my favorite episodes, but after 1835 previous reviews of this series, you've gotten the message. Allow me to share this with you, though: After spending 4 days last week watching the series non-stop on DVD, I was chomping at the bit to go see the movie. I checked the newspapers to see if it was still showing anywhere here, since it had been playing for about a month at the time. Thankfully, it was still showing at ONE THEATRE quite a distance from where I live, and it goes without saying that it was worth the time, distance & $$ to get to see a truly fantastic movie. (Thank YOU, Joss.) It was the 7:30 showing that evening, and just imagine my surprise when I walked into the theatre to find it nearly PACKED. I thought I'd actually walked into the Friday night premiere of JARHEAD or something. Walked up to the top row, found a seat and asked the girl next to me if this was the theatre for SERENITY, & she said it was. No way in hell was I expecting to see that many people in the theatre that night, considering the movie was on its last run before (hopefully) hitting the dollar houses. Hard to describe the feeling that went through me as the lights went down and the movie started up...""corny"" as this might sound to some, there was a real feeling of camaraderie, of family...like I was part of a large group of like-minded people of greater-than-average intelligence who know quality when they see it. I'm sure I don't have to tell any of you by now what a rush the movie was, or how it's one of the few movies I've seen in recent memory that I would pay to see again.As has been stated by other reviewers, we can hope that the suits at Fox have learned a lesson by pulling the plug on a series that deserved to survive. (Can't help wondering if the FX network might learn a similar lesson now that I've heard that OVER THERE has been cancelled...) I'd like to believe that this series will be remembered for ages to come for its quality, its humor, its depth, its humanity. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and I feel blessed to be a part of the Firefly/Serenity community.",N/A

It is also fascinating that it is the youngest person who actually has philanthropic ideas on how to spend it.Spurred on by the urgency that England is switching over to the Euro in a few days (not gonna happen,) freckle-faced Damien and his brother, Anthony, have to think fast.  Damien feels the money came from God and therefore should be used to help the less fortunate.  Anthony feels like they *are* the less fortunate and should use it to help themselves.  Damien is also helped by odd visions of saints who counsel him.  Meanwhile, Anthony is out pricing real estate.Of course, tossing money on unsuspecting children is not really God's style, as the boys' father states.  The money was actually tossed by a bank robber who wants it back at any cost.This is a fun yet profound film that accurately shows greed, kindness, faith, and selfishness all resulting from the same event.

159243,"This most fondly remembered film from the 1950's is romantic escapism at its finest and most frivolous. There are no deeper meanings here, just a beautiful and colorful dish of Rome garnished with three equally pleasing romantic stories. An attractive cast and an appropriately romantic score from the great Victor Young make this film based on John H. Secondari's popular novel of the day a rousing success. Sinatra's fine rendition of the Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn title song doesn't hurt a bit either.Dorothy McGuire, Jean Peters and Maggie McNamara are three secretaries who follow the tradition of throwing a coin over their shoulder into the beautiful fountains in Rome and making a wish. The wish is supposed to be about staying in Rome forever, but of course is really about finding love and staying in Rome forever.Frances (McGuire) is in love with her boss John Shadwell (Clifton Webb), a famous writer who has been in romantic Rome many years, yet can't see what everyone else already knows. Anita (Jean Peters) is going back home to America in two weeks so breaks office rules when she accepts an invitation from Georgio (Rossano Brazzi) to the country for a weekend. And Maria (Maggie McNamara) is the new arrival, enraptured by the beauty of Rome and a playboy Prince (Louis Jourdan) she sets her sights on.Nothing is rushed in Rome as one of the girls explains to newcomer Maria, and neither will this film be. Each story takes its time but the scenery is so beautiful you never get bored, not even for a moment. There are complications to each romance I'll refrain from revealing here, so there will at least be a few surprises awaiting you if you have not seen this before.The film begins at the fountains in Rome and will end there, with the title song being sung by a chorus as everyone's romantic sory is sorted out in enjoyable fashion. Color was only good in musicals and escapist fare like this. Here the glorious technicolor should get star billing, as it holds our attention even during the more leisurely moments of the story.If you don't want a heavy meal but like to go straight to the desert instead, you can't go wrong with this one.

Anyone who has seen A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC in its previous video releases knows that this DVD release is magnificent in almost EVERY way.The original Embassy VHS release was fuzzy and washed out - but at least there was some hint of color. The later Nelson VHS and Laser Disc release was fuzzy, washed out and drained the color out of the film completely. In both cases it was in full screen, the picture was compressed so that the actors faces were thin and angular and the sound was merely adequate.Now Henstooth presents this long-lost film in the best version we have ever seen  since its original theatrical release. The colors are bright and warm. The picture is restored to its original size and the sound is crisp and clear. (All of this is rather remarkable considering that the word is that the original negatives for this film have all but been destoyed and is in need of a major restoration.) I didn't have much hope for this release when announced but having seen it, it took my breath away.Now the film --Based on Ingmar Bergman's film SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT, this musical film adapted by its Broadway creators Hugh Wheeler (screenplay), Stephen Sondheim (Music and Lyrics) and Harold Prince (director), concerns three mismatched couples.Actress Desiree Armfeldt (Elizabeth Taylor), is seeing Count Mittelheim (Laurence Guittard) who is married to Charlotte Mittelheim (a delicious scene stealing performance from Diana Rigg). Frederick Egerman (Len Cariou), Deseiree's past lover, is married to the still-virginal Anne (Lesley-Anne Down), who is half his age. Frederick's son Erick (Christopher Guard) is hopelessly in love with his stepmother Anne (who is actually only a year younger than he.)Petra (Lesley Dunlop); Frederick and Anne's maid, Madame Armfeldt (Hermione Gingold); Desiree's mother, and Frederika (Chloe Franks); Desiree's daughter - round out the action which occurs in town and culminates during a hectic ""Weekend in the Country"" at Madame Armfeldt's sprawling manor.Forget what you've heard or read about the film. Yes, it is flawed in context to the Broadway original, but considering it was made when film musicals were all but dead in Hollywood, it is amazing that it even exists. The score is still just as witty and romantic and features a wonderful new version of THE GLAMOROUS LIFE written specifically for the film. The cast, many of them reprising their original stage roles, is uniformly superb! And despite all the nasty comments, Elizabeth Taylor is quite charming as Desiree (especially in the duet YOU MUST MEET MY WIFE with Cariou.) Sondheim even added a new verse or two for the marvelous song EVERY DAY A LITTLE DEATH.If you get a chance - see this film in its new DVD transfer (The best it has ever looked or sounded on home video!)

700945,"In some ways, ""Fulltime Killer"" is a bit of a mishmash, but while it may not be perfect cinema, it's certainly a delightful action genre.  Director Johnny To who did ""The Mission"" and recently the romantic ""Xiang Zuo Zuo, Xiang You Zou,"" has sometimes been compared as the Hong Kong Antonioni with a brooding sense of gloom that pervades his action efforts.  This comes though as Takashi Sorimachi as O is a very disciplined assassin who lays low and takes a careful appraoch.  He rents a flat & then rents another space in another building across the way to observe by telescope what happens in his apartment.  His housekeeper is killed and sends him into an emotional tailspin since he'd developed an attachment for her.  Kelly Lin as Chin becomes the part-time housekeeper and is observed from afar.  Andy Lau is delightful as the flashy killer eager to establish his reputation and out-do his rival O.  He parades around in a Bill Clinton mask and injects a mob boss with a lethal syringe.  Simon Yam as Inspector Lee does a great job, although his character seems queer when he resigns to write a book.  I found elements of Hitchcock as well as O carefully observes his flat by telescope.  The firework filled big bang of an ending in the warehouse worked for me and was Matrix-like in its cinematic assault.  While not perfect, this is an excellent piece by this Hong Kong director with blockbuster performances by its stars.  Enjoy!",N/A

Yes, there are other good ones too, but NYPD Blue, started it all in the nineties with it's gritty, realistic stories, compelling characters and edgy camera work.  It's nearest rival in the nineties was ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and only ""Boomtown"" and ""The Wire"" were comparable in terms of quality over the last three or four years.  That's something!The show actually got better after the departure of David Caruso.  Bobby Simone as played by Jimmy Smits was a much more low-key portrayal in keeping with the ensemble approach  to the show and allowed the other characters to shine as well, in contrast to Season 1.Fox is changing the packaging slightly by putting the episodes on 4 two-sided discs rather than having 6 or 8 single sided discs.  I hope that these do not suffer the same problems as many of Universal's releases which also utilize two-sided discs.Support this show and buy the releases so that the Fox execs continue to release all seasons until 12.

627363,"I know I'm probably going to get a barrage of not helpful votes like for my reviews of ""Monty Python & The Holy Grail"" and ""Titanic"", but I actually found ""Meet The Fockers"" funnier than the first moive, 2000's ""Meet The Parents"". I got a lot more of the humor and the additoion of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand to the cast made the film for me.The film picks up some time after the events of the first one. Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller) has finally earned the respect of future father in law Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro), who he is now allowing to marry his daughter Pamela (Teri Polo). However, there is one hurdle they have to clear: meeting Gaylord's parents. Jack is intent on meeting his daughter's future in-laws. So, the Byrnes (including Blythe Danner, returning as Dina Byrnes, and Jinx the Cat) journey down to Florida to meet Bernie Fokcer (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand), Greg's carefree parents. As soon as they meet each other, it's clear that the Byrnes and the Fockers are polar oppsites. The Byrnes (okay, Jack) are conservative and somewhat stuffy. They tell onlyof their achievements and think that a simple handshake is the proper way to show friendship. The Fockers on the other hand are the opposite: they hug people, tell embarassing stories, and dedicate an entire wall to Greg's underachievements. This creates some tension between ex - CIA agent Jack and Greg.This results in several slight but very funny gags. Among them, a football goes horribly wrong, baby Jack drinks booze and sees ""Scarface"", Greg ""speaks the truth"" aout what he thinks of everyone, andon top of it all, Gaylord may already have a little Focker of his own.It's basically a rehash of the first movie, but the same schtick is even funnier the second time around.

865447,"After I saw this film, I could easily see how it was pitched to the studios...""Cellular is Speed meets Phone Booth"", and that's exactly what it is.  Sure, it follows a suspense-film formula that we've seen before, with the gimmick of this one a cellular phone instead of a phone booth or a bus with a bomb that cannot drop below 55 mph, but its still an interesting premise and it works surprisingly well.  I give huge credit for that to actor Chris Evans in his first starring role.  He emotes quite well, very realistically, considering that he's practically on a cell phone for most of the movie.  His facial expressions and comments are fun to watch.Kim Basinger plays the terrified victim, who pretty much yells and screams a lot, but she has a few tricks up her sleeves as well, so that's a relief.  To reveal anything more about the film would spoil the plot, as there are some neat twists thrown in, while also falling prey to some moments of predictability as well.  Its a good suspense and action film that packs a lot of punch in the short 90 minute duration.  After seeing the deleted scenes, I personally think the original ending was better.  Its just a few seconds longer, but it packs more of a punch.  Overall, a film worth watching and it will undoubtedly remind you of ""Speed"" and ""Phone Booth"" as a perfect blend of both.  This film probably launched Chris Evans' career, so expect to see more of him in the future.There are a few short documentaries on the disk...including one on the way cell phones have transformed society.  It is surprisingly accurate, even down to some of the negatives associated with cell phone usage (people discussing the minutaie of their lives to the poor unfortunate souls on the other end of the line; people even using it while at a urinal--which I did happen to witness once and thought it crossed the line in cell phone etiquette).  Very fascinating documentary...cell phones are here to stay and I still haven't succumbed to the pressures of owning one (I guess I still value the idea of being ""unreachable"").",N/A
205771,"A great cast and some snappy dialogue make this nutty comedy about a woman who wants to divorce her husband in order to finance him by marrying a wealthy man, is everything this genre of comedy can be. Preston Sturges wrote and directed this little gem with fast pacing, and lots of little character parts to back up his stars, that help the keep the humor going throughout the film. The generous but deaf Wenie King (Robert Dudley), Sig Arno as Toto, and Arthur Hoyt as the Pullman conductor are among those that make this film take flight.Claudette Colbert sparkles, and looks heavenly in an assortment of lavish gowns, and Joel McCrea plays her handsome but penniless husband, an inventor whose ideas have never paid off. Enter myopic millionaire John D. Hackensacker III, played with marvelous ease by Rudy Vallee, who goes on a shopping spree when he meets Claudette that includes a very large diamond ring. To complicate matters, Rudy has a sophisticated and lustful sister (Mary Astor in a terrific performance), who sets her heart on Joel, because she has been led to believe he is Claudette's brother.Victor Young wrote the music, and Rudy Vallee, the legendary ""Megaphone Crooner"" of the 1930s, sings ""Goodnight Sweetheart."" Always unpredictable, ""Palm Beach Story"" is a silly, wacky farce that is written with intelligence, making it a smart and sassy comedy, with never a dull moment between chuckles.

724496,"This DVD release presents one of Hendrix's most memorable live performances. Playing in front of 600,000 people, Hendrix quickly goes to work, taking control of the show with his guitar right around his performance of Spanish Castle Magic. This leads into some of the greatest guitar mastery you'll ever hear, with blasting metal riffs found within basically every song listed hear. Jimi's voice isn't in good voice at all times, but obviously that doesn't matter, seeing as Hendrix was never known for having a great singing voice.Their are many superb performances throughout this thrilling performance, and the special features are interesting as well. We get to see a Behind the scenes interview with Director Murray Lerner. Also featured are a couple of brief clips from other Live DVDs in the Hendrix collection. The Introduction before the concert is also very interesting to see, and we get to hear from bassist Billy Cox and drummer Mitch Mitchell.As for the overall footage and its presentation, such songs like Red House, Machine Gun and Spanish Castle Magic have strong camera work and we get some nice looks at Jimi soloing. The sound quality is perfect, and for the most part, the performance is enjoyable to watch.Performance Highlights:All Along the Watchtower: An epic song, and Hendrix gives a superb performance, with some fabulous guitar work. Always a classic song, and this is one great performance of the hit song.Machine Gun: The song immediately following All Along the Watchtower, Hendrix takes on a guitar journey with some of the most incredible guitar solos you'll ever hear. Great drumming on this one too.Red House: Most likely the most memorable performance from the concert, Hendrix takes a blues hit with a very, delicate, superb pace and displays his magnificent sense of blues. This live version is nearly 12 minutes long which leaves it being roughly 3 times the length of the song in its original form.In From The Storm: A perfect close, to a seemingly incredible live performance from the greatest guitar player of all time. Jimi is also in perfect voice for this one. Superb guitar work also compliment the song.Overall, I would have to recommend this DVD to any Jimi Hendrix fan, as it is truly an epic Hendrix concert, Live at The Isle of Wight. However, rock fans just looking into his music should avoid this DVD. Highly recommended to Jimi Hendrix fans who want to witness one of the greatest live rock performances of all time.",N/A
159067,"I got sick of waiting for Lucas to release the original trilogy on DVD a long time ago and I actually purchased a LaserDisc player and the so-called 'Original' Star Wars trilogy on laserdisc - only it's not the original Empire Strikes Back that I saw in the theater!!THE MISSING SCENES FROM EMPIRE STRIKES BACK:1 - The 'Bacta' scene with Luke in the tank and the medical droid was longer. Thre was a point where Luke was floating in the tank and you see this red goo/dye injected into the tank. Then they pull him out and Leia or 21B (the droid) says something like, 'The Bacta are growing well, the scars should be gone in a day or two...'When I saw 'Empire' in the theater back in 1980 there was another scene I will never forget that I have NEVER seen since except on the earliest of (bootleg?)VHS copies.2 - In the battle scene on Hoth in 'The Empire Strikes Back', right before General Veers is about to destroy the power generators, Hobby 'kamikazees' the walker with his snowspeeder. He lets out a blood curdling 'Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!' on his way in. You see the snowspeeder coming in from General Veers perspective from inside the walker then you see the General - the expression on his face is priceless. The walker's head then explodes as the snowspeeder hits it. Another walker then destroys the power gens a little later. The power gen explosion is also different, it is a more pulled-back shot with full view of a nuclear mushroom cloud superimposed over what were the generators.Also!CUT SCENE/AUDIO #3When the snowtroopers enter the base immediately following the battle, there are some scenes cut out of them rushing in to the command center and the audio has been changed to eliminate a PA announcement that says, 'Imperial troops have entered the base, Imperial troops have entered the base! (then Static as it is cut off presumably by the announcer being killed).I give up.It turns out that my local theater may have gotten a 'prescreener' version of the film!I have purchased the 'Special Editions', the original laserdisc releases, and a bootleg DVD set from eBay and I STILL do not have the original trilogy unaltered.

245269,"I needn't repeat all the fine reviews preceding mine. Just a few salient items round them out.First, as Martin Ritt never made a bad film, this is among his finest, especially in his poetic understanding of LeCarre's masterpiece. How his colleague and competitor Sir Carol Reed must have smiled upon that moment when Burton, seeing his photo on the front page of The Times, listed as missing and sought by the police, looks westward from Holland's shores toward an invisible Britain, the Channel's mist symbolic of an England which he then knows he'll never see again. This must be among all of filmdom's finest moments.Second, the wondrous collusion between Ritt and LeCarre is masterful. To belabor the point: As 20th century prosody shakes out, the author doubtless will be considered among the top of the heap. If ever a film faithfully transferred not just plot, not just characters, but as well the ethos of the writing, Ritt's film does it.Third, the electricity between Burton and Bloom is ecstatic in the literal sense precisely because she is no sex-pot and he is, in fact, a burned-out sot. Her need of him is electrifying because of her need for realizing herself. This LeCarre struggled to portray in the book, and Ritt brought it out so beautifully in this splendid actress, Burton so masterfully assisting her. What a protege quality to their roles!Fourth, for those of us devotees of George Smiley, Rupert Davies' Smiley role is perfectly cast, well fitting LeCarre's description of him. No one would ever fault the decades-later portrayal by Sir Alec Guinness, of course, because he gave the role in impression. But Davies, for his spare moments in the film, shows us what Smiley looks like in LeCarre's ink.Fifth, the writing is superlative, LeCarre having had the major hand in the screenplay. The more philosophic conversations thankfully are easily summarized by Bloom, Burton, Cusack and Werner, quite to the point, sparing us any contrivances. Only the later Rohmer could have done more, but his type of talent would have destroyed this picture.Sixth, what a good transfer this is, for sound as well as sight. Altogether, it is fine film-making. And that this movie in its generation is a faithful representation of an early LeCarre work makes it a joy to see, so tragic as it is.",The Spy Who Came in From the Cold VHS
628852,"I was attracted to Garden State at first because it went to the Sundance Film Festival, whose movies - most of them - I loved a lot. The movie starts well, with some unique perspective on characterization and techniques in revealing the alone-ness of characters. Yet, the whole plot finally falls into a ""I-love-you-and-I-don't-want-to-leave-you-anymore"" ending. The closure of the movie is disappointing as it seems unconvincing how Largeman (Braff) and Sam (Portman) heal each other's pathological habits and attitudes. Largeman suffers from depression. Why did he experience a siginificant state of epiphany later on? Not clear. Portman claims to ba a pathological liar. Does she really stop lying? Not clear? What is there is merely the romance plot, which, inevitably leads to whole movie to end in a commercial way, like many others high-school romance. Garden State is about the troubled generation, about how the troubled individuals survive in their difficult lives. As a view, I can see how they are troubled, but I can't see how they are relieved. Portman gives an impressive performance, which really revives my memory of her in Closer. Braff's is dull, monotonous and flat. I always feel like I am watching an expression-less Adam Sandler.",Garden State

638733,"This movie was one of the all-time big disappointments.  It seems like they got everything wrong they possibly could.  I am not a purist, and I can certainly accept changes, but the only resemblence to the books, radio series or TV series (which all made changes) are the names, and the superficial aspects of some incidents.  The movie captured none of the wonderful, wacky feel of the earlier versions.I knew the movie was in big trouble when they started implying a Hollywood romance between Arthur and Trillian.  But when I saw what they did to Marvin, I knew the people responsible for this mess of a movie completely missed all the points.They tried to make a mass market movie from a cult classic, deleting virtually all the special flavor that made it a cult classic, but it's still too off-the-wall for mainstream audiences.This could have been a great film, if some attempt had been made to retain the spirit of the earlier versions.  Instead, it seems like a delibrate attempt was made to stamp out any semblence of such spirit.  The focus seemed to be on replacing all the wit and subversiveness with nifty special effects.I walked out of the theatre halfway through, keenly resenting the ticket price and the hour of my life so thoroughly wasted.

Kiba wakes up to find himself in an idyllic wilderness paradise, with a lynx-like creature named Mew, who can assume human form like the wolves. Kiba feels at peace and begins to forget about the past, present, and future. Has he found Paradise, or is there something more sinister working underneath it all? As his friends desperately try to locate him, they encounter a human tribe who look suspiciously like Native American Indians whose legends say they are descended from wolves. As the human world begins to descend into full-scale warfare, Hubb and Cher continue their search for Cheza, who was captured by Jaguara's forces along with Blue. And let's not forget about Quent, the wolf-killer whose life just might be saved by the creatures he hates.After being infuriated by the last volume of Wolf's Rain, which consisted entirely of flashbacks and recycled animation, this was a welcome return to a series that I rank as one of the best. Like Cowboy Bebop, this anime has a very American feel to me. At times, it seems equal parts fairy tale and visionquest. In an interview with one of the shows creators, it is stated that some people just ""won't get"" this series. In other words, they won't comprehend it and get behind it and support it. But I promise you, if you let yourself go and get involved in this story, you'll enter a world more incredible than any other film out there.

729323,"This farcical ""who done it"" is funny, absurd, campish, and silly all at the same time.  Starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the French cinema, 8 femmes reminds me of similar tongue-in-cheek ""who done its"" such as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and especially Neil Simon's Murder by Death.Adapted from the play by Robert Thomas, which accounts for the stage play feel to the production, this one begins--as a proper murder mystery might--with a murder in a well-appointed house out in the country.  Somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion.  While Neil Simon made fun of detectives in Murder by Death, and Agatha Christie made fun of murder, period, here the fun is on the players themselves. What follows, as all point fingers away from themselves, is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about.The scandalous revelations, including interracial lesbianism, same- and heterosexual incest, etc., are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties.  (Note Suzon's pink/orange pony skirt.)  To quote a line from the film, ""it's a sad family affair"" played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight.  Yet, there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film.  Strange.In another sense this is a celebration of some of the French cinema's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs.Catherine Deneuve heads the cast as Gaby the wife of the murdered.  She looks stately, beautiful and more than a bit spoiled.  Danielle Darrieux at 85 steals a few scenes as the mother, Mamy.  Isabelle Huppert makes herself into a neurotic, dotty old maid named Augustine while Emmanuelle Beart plays Louise, the sexy maid.  Fanny Ardant is Pierrette, Gaby's scandalous sister-in-law.  The cast takes turns doing lightweight song and dance numbers which tends to fluff out the production in a sweet fifties-ish way.  In a kind of gender joke, no men appear in the movie, although we do see the back of Marcel (Gaby's husband) a couple of times.You will not be able to guess who done it, but I will not tell you why.See this for Danielle Darrieux, one the grande dames of the French cinema whose film credits go back to 1931--yes, 1931.

Director Tony Scott employs ADD filmmaking to get Domino's frantic story across.  The constant quick cuts work against the story, but after a while become bearable.  Knightly does an adequate job as the titular character, with great support from Rourke.  Ironically, two of the best roles are Brian Austin Green and Ian Ziering (from ""Beverly Hills 90210"") playing themselves as hosts of a reality show focusing on Domino and her gang.This film will probably either be loved or hated by the average viewer, most likely hated.

846875,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE UNRATED WIDESCREEN EDITIONI won't spend much time on reviewing the movie itself as there are plenty here for you check out. I will do a review on the ""director's cut"" version and the DVD itself. In a nutshell COR is a combination of action sci-fi and classic serial science fiction (or ""Comic Book"" sci-fi if you prefer). In other words lots of cool action, fantastic sets, nice special effects, and decent plot development is on one side. On the other side you get cheesy names for locales and peoples (Crematoria, Hellion, The Elementals, The Necromongers), a few 2-dimensional characters, and a somewhat condensed story. This kind of content would do well in a longer run time (in spite of that being taboo in Hollywood). While it is a completely different kind of movie than the previous one, for those who loved Riddick in Pitch Black you will love him here too.Now for the special edition. To those of you who watched the theatrical version and complained about holes in the story a lot of them get filled in this edition. With 15 minutes of new footage lots of little loose ends get tied up and a new character is introduced. The new slant might seem a bit on the mystical side for some tastes, but I felt it appropriate. There are more than a few little things added to scenes to help flesh out development and I'm glad they did that.Probably the biggest change was the big fight scene at Crematoria. It now has more of it and the scene now has full audio sounds of guns blazing and bodies busted instead of just music like on the theatrical release. As much as I enjoy the additional footage I kinda liked the silence of the theatrical release better. What with just music playing and seeing all that mayhem it felt more dramatic and even artsy (in a ""Ballet of Death"" sort of way).They took out the ""Back of the Bus"" dialog in one scene, which i miss. Seems like they replaced it with a ""sexy"" scene that to me is a total waste of film. Don't ask me why they decided to put such a useless scene in (if you watch you'll know what I'm talking about). At least this is the only added footage that I recall that would have been better off in the deleted scenes section.While I won't say they fixed everything and now COR is the movie it should have been I do have to admit it felt much better watching the Unrated Edition as opposed to the Theatrical one. That might just be that I picked up more the third time around (yes I saw it twice in the theater), but then again maybe the new cut is just plain better. As for the ""unrated"" rating it's no big deal. More violence but still little to no blood and gore. Maybe a little more bad language, but it didn't seem like it. I guess it could be an R movie now, but it's a light R. If I was the one running the MPAA I would still call this a PG-13 movie.Quality-wise Twohy makes a comment on the introduction about how you might see noticeable fluctuations where they made the cuts for the new footage, but I didn't notice any. However I didn't see it on HDTV so maybe as you get to better quality TV's and bigger screen tv's you might notice it. DVD looks great and visually crisp with the audio being just as clear.The extras are pretty good, but I've seen better. Here's a breakdown:Audio Commentary - It's informative but not nearly as much as I had hoped. There is a fair amount of the crew just shooting the breeze comparitively speaking. No Vin commentary, which I would have liked to have heard since he apparently put a LOT of creative effort into this movie.Two menus - The exact same menu but with different art and stuff. An interesting diversion, but not a dealmaker.Toombs Log - Interesting, but doesn't really give you that much insight. As a primer for the movie don't bother, but as a little character development on Toombs' side it works well enough.Worlds or Riddick - The 360 degree view of some of the sets is not bad. The sets are pretty neat and it's nice to know they didn't go all CG like George Lucas and actually built some wonderful sets. Extra feature-wise? Again I say... I've seen better. The tiny featurette with Vin Diesel was the most informative and entertaining of this set. That little snippet should have been longer.Documentary - A pretty good documentary for its size. Definitely the most worthwhile extra on here. Again it would be nice if they made it longer.Deleted scenes - Some of these scenes are not only cool, but I feel would have really given more depth to the movie. Those few scenes I wish had stayed, but most are approprately taken out for whatever reason. Still as far as deleted scenes go most of them are pretty nice with only one lame duck scene that never should have gotten past the script that I recall.Virtual Guide - Practically useless if you are looking get more insight into the Riddick universe. Doesn't really tell you anything more than what you would find out in the movie anyway.Facts on Demand Viewing - Haven't tried it yet, but it sounds interesting. Will update when I learn more.Riddick X-Box game - Useless if you don't have an X-Box. No trailers or other teasers for non-X'ers to see.All in all if you liked Riddick in the theater you definitely should be getting this version. Forget the theatrical cut. There is more to love here. If you never seen Chronicles of Riddick and are a sci-fi fan of any kind I recommend renting this. If you like what you see you can always buy it later. Better yet go to one of those used DVD stores that apply credit from rental towards a purchase.",N/A

792421,"When I first caught this movie on cable I was flipping channels and the ambience immediately attracted me.  The use of dark colors is beautiful and gives you the feel of watching a home movie almost. The underlying emotion and attitude was so strong that I could tell right away that it was going to have a profound message.  I was compelled to watch it.It was astonishing in its honesty.  So many things about both of the girls struck a chord with me.  I felt like I could relate completely in my own teenage experiences.After a while I stopped relating and was suddenly terrified.  I'm not a teenager anymore.  These things are not ok.  They're dangerous and it scares the heck out of me that not only did I do some of these things, but as a parent, my own children could be doing these things... and they might not be as lucky or as smart as I was to get away from them.What scares me even more about this film is that if I had seen it as a teenager I would have thought it was cool.

747541,"Over the decades, I have watched hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours of documentary film on W.W.II.  Most all of these films have been in b&w;, but I have not seen a feature length documentary of this quality devoted solely to color film.I was skeptical as to the merits of the film since only a small percentage of W.W.II film was in color.  However, the PBS producers out did themselves in achieving a superb documentary.  The main fault with the film was the occasional disjointed telling of the story so that the film could continue with only color footage.  However, the overall effect was compelling enough to forgive these infrequent intrusions.What makes this documentary unique from the very few other color-documentaries is the producers finding so many home made films by soldiers' families.  This brought the story to a more intimate level than many other such films.  Also, I became emotional in listening to many of the letters written by soldiers and their loved ones.  In one particular case, a marine officer writes eloquently to his very young children to speak about himself in case he should not return to them.  All the while, the viewer watches home movies of this marine with his infants and his wife.  We then learn that the marine died in action.  If that scene alone is not worth supporting the viewing of this film, then you've got very cold blood in your veins.The World at War series (filmed in b&w;) is still the best overall documentary of this subject (especially the dvd version with the extra features).  However, Perilous Fight is a must have dvd and it would go far to better educate our children about the war, and the troubled period of this nations history when the war was fought.  That is not to degrade the b&w; films, but I really noticed things in Perilous Fight footage that I can't always say were as obvious in b&w; versions.  For example, the sometimes beauty of the scenery in which some of the bloody battles were fought.Finally, for those who oppose this film because of the narrator, I guess the overused phrase ""Get over it"" comes to mind.  My father was a W.W.II vet and I'm sure that he would have loved to have seen this film.  Can you imagine not watching the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston, or The Searchers with John Wayne just because you didn't like their political views?  That kind of criticism is beyond odd, it's just plain childish logic.  Besides, if one were to attribute politics to the narrator of this documentary, then one could only conclude that the narrator is highly patriotic and holds great empathy for the W.W.II vet since that is the message from this film.P.s., there is much footage of dead, severely wounded, and dismembered bodies including Americans.  The viewer should exercise careful judgment about allowing pre-teens to see the whole of this film.",The Perilous Fight - America's World War II in Color
790656,"When does a trashy movie stop being fun and start being repulsive?  I've been asking myself this question ever since I saw Ching Siu-Tung's ""Naked Weapon"" (2002).  Ching is one of my favorite action directors.  His credits include the underrated gem ""The Terra-Cotta Warrior"" (1989) and better-known actioners like ""The East Is Red"" (1993).  He also provided the fight choreography for several of Tsui Hark's films and Zhang Yimou's two high-profile martial-arts movies.  So, seeing Ching's name on the credits of ""Naked Weapon"" instantly told me that the film would be a quality product.  But I was not only disappointed -- I was revolted.Now, I don't automatically fault a film for being a bit on the junky side.  Cult cinema certainly has its place, and so-called ""trash"" aesthetics can have their own positive properties that are as intriguing as the more ""respectable"" ones employed by more prestigious films.  So, just because some filmmakers might not take their subject matter seriously, or just because they might revel in the artificiality of their medium, that is not reason enough to condemn a movie.  Films that utilize trash aesthetics include many of John Waters' intriguing works and several enjoyable romps from Hong Kong like Luk Kim-Ming's ""Robotrix"" (1993).But ""Naked Weapon"" crossed the line from trashy action movie to something more disturbing.  Perhaps we're not supposed to take the film's premise -- a secret Darwinian ""school"" for female assassins where the pupils must kill each other to ""graduate"" -- at face value, but the subject is viewed with a solemnly straight face, not with a cartoonish or ironic distance.  Coupled with Ching's fierce fight choreography, the bloody, nerve-racking events faced by the main character, Charlene (Maggie Q), are harrowing in an unpleasant way.  Like other films I detest -- such as Masaru Konuma's ""Wife to Be Sacrificed"" (1974) or Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Sal&ograve;"" (1975) -- ""Naked Weapon"" seems to encourage its audience to take sadistic delight in its lead character's misfortunes.This unsettling element reaches its pinnacle mid-way in the film when the ""school's"" cold-blooded leader, Madame M (Almen Wong), drugs her surviving graduates (presumably virgins) and has them raped by her male guards.  The scene is utterly gratuitous, and its gut-wrenching realism erases any ability to view the moment simply as a make-believe fiction.  The ""making of"" documentary that is included on ""Naked Weapon's"" DVD interviews Maggie Q and the other actresses after the rape scene was shot, and the women seem somewhat traumatized by the experience.  Why would a director want to put his actresses through such an ordeal?  For what purpose?  Furthermore, I would submit that the scene wants the viewer to identify with the rapists, rather than the women being raped.Now, let me be clear: I am not arguing against all depictions of rape per se.  The aquatic rape scene in ""Erotic Ghost Story II"" (1991) and the invisible rape scene in ""The Eternal Evil of Asia"" (1995) were too over-the-top to take seriously as portrayals of violence against women, as anything other than bizarre performances staged for the camera.  And there are more substantial films about rape where the viewer is made to indentify with the victim.  ""Naked Weapon's"" rape scene is in a different class entirely: a humorless, realistic moment where the (presumably male) viewer is allowed to relish the sexual suffering of beautiful women.  Moreover, Madame M never gets her comeuppance in the story (suggesting that the rape didn't warrant punishment), and Charlene's climatic battle with an out-of-left-field villain implies that it was her ordeals with Madame M -- including the rape -- that enable her to prevail.  Rape, the movie implies, is a relatively positive stepping stone toward female ""empowerment,"" something akin to a difficult step in a Shaolin student's martial-arts training.Some comments elsewhere on the Internet say that the rape scene in ""Naked Weapon"" shouldn't be taken seriously.  But the moment is played very seriously in this very serious film.  Others say that the scene should be taken within the context of the action genre.  I disagree: ""Naked Weapon"" is already a very grueling film about scantily clad women inflicting pain on each other in order to survive.  The action genre mandates neither the Darwinian violence of the ""student"" assassins against each other (I kept waiting for the girls to rise up against Madame M) nor the male viewer's pleasure in female suffering.  I'm appalled that anyone -- especially a director I respect -- would find this sadistic portrayal of rape and violence entertaining.",Naked Weapon

407382,"Hellraiser IV: BloodlineAs my subject line of my review states. Being a huge fan of I and II - I've looked upon later movies in the franchise with a leery eye. Too much of good thing spoils the flesh.Pleasingly, this one isn't a hour and 20 some minutes wasted. The story at times is engaging and demands your attention. As in many of my reviews, I'll avoid the already reviewed ground of the plot and offer my insights.The opening scenes of ""Hellraiser in Space"" at first, I almost turned the movie off. But then, something said give it a chance so off I went.  I'm generally not a fan of flashback sequences. This one however was well done. The flashbacks provided pivotal backstory as to the events of 2127 and what lead to events on the space station.I agree with the statements that the Merchant men should've been played by different actors. One face spanning the generations. Don't buy it. Different cast actors would've made it more believable.Using seduction instead of pain in competing Demon styles was interesting. Although Pinhead gets the last line and laugh there. He was on target with terror vs. seduction.My favorite scene when the one black man's skin on his face is completely torn off. Just gorgeously gorey. It was quick and brutal. Pinhead wasn't in the mood for a long play session. ;)Overall the story holds my interest. However, with the removal of Pinhead which largely *is* the franchise these days. It becomes much weaker.Thats where my criticism comes in. I've never been able to get past in II when Pinhead gets killed.  The good doctor reduces him to a mortal, then offs him. I know he comes back in the end of II with the rotating column - translation sequel.  However, after Pinhead's and the Cenobytes deaths in that film. That left an impression of finality.To resurrect Pinhead for go around after go around. Its turned the Hellraiser franchise into too much of a good thing. It lost its special touch I and II had.As a sequel its worth checking out if you enjoyed I and II. Just rent it first.",Hellraiser: Bloodline VHS

I stumbled across this when I was looking for something  a little more mature than his regular Sesame Street type videos (which he still loves, but this gives him a variety). While it has Spiderman's origin story told again (to a little girl who is Webhead's greatest fan) and some 'only in New York' scenarios such as the female jamaican cabby who comes to the aid of the Webhead, the grand kid still is a bit frightened at the Green Goblin. He calls the Goblin ""Monster"" and edges near his paw-paw for protection. Overall, the web swinging and the sticking on the walls alone are enough to keep him into it. This may be a better show for him when he gets older...but hey! For all other Spiderman fans, this is a great video of the 80's series that adequately touch all the bases.

Obivously, even if you've never seen the musical, you know that the movie version is going to be different because, well, you don't get the luxury of ""takes"" on stage, and a movie is much larger than a stage production ever could be.For the movie itself, this DVD was magnificent. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, with the stunning visuals and well-rounded cast of actors and actresses. As a DVD, the full-screen edition SUCKS, because, well, there are no extras! All you get is the theatrical trailer.

608530,"This is probably the best Star Wars film to date. ""The Phantom Menace"" seemed more aimed toward the younger audiences where the plot had no real significance to the Saga beyond the finding of Anakin Skywalker. ""Attack of the Clones"" was overall better,but was very slow-paced and had only momentary action. The Original Trilogy was great, but had several side plots just to extend the movies, slowing it down. ""Revenge of the Sith"", however, has action all throughout the movie keeping you at the edge of your seat, with plot twists that will keep you very interested.""Revenge of the Sith"" does have its share of problems though. Continuity is slightly flawed here, with the unexplained reason why the Clone Troopers' helmets being changed and the droids having higher-pitched voices than the previouse two films. Count Dooku played a very inportant role in ""Episode II"", and I wish it could be so in this one, but it is not as Anakin kills him very quickly early on in the film. After watching the ""Star Wars: Clone Wars Animated Micro-Series"" I expected General Grievous to be the ultimate ""Star Wars"" villain, but it turns out, he was just and over-confidant pushover that could have been left out of the film.The rest of the film though is great and easily makes up for the flaws ad so much more.

901404,"Because DEAR FRANKIE is a limited release, many of us have to drive a while to find a theater that is showing it. The 25 mile drive I took was completely worth it.Emily Mortimer plays Lizzie, who has been writing letters under the guise of her estranged husband to her deaf son, Frankie, for years. In writing the letters many things are accomplished. Frankie gets to feel like he has some contact with his dad and Lizzie gets to hear the innermost thoughts and wishes of her son through the letters she reads and answers.When Lizzie, Frankie, and grandma Nell arrive in a new town, they befriend Marie. They also learn that the Accra--the ship on which Frankie thinks his dad lives--is docking near their town. With Marie's help, Lizzie encounters ""The Stranger"" and pays him to pretend to be Frankie's dad for one day.Now I have seen a couple of critics find fault in casting Gerard Butler as The Stranger, thinking him too cold and gruff for the role. If these critics had watched the movie closer, they would've seen that the role called for gruffness at the beginning. However, Frankie has the same affect on The Stranger as he has on everyone else--making people want to be better and thawing out their chilly dispositions.By the end of the movie everyone has learned something. Frankie has learned some truths through his mother and discovered others on his own. Lizzie learns to open up to others a little more. We learn who The Stranger actually is and, though we don't know anything about his past, we know that he has probably been emotionally shut down for a long time.Like many, I went to see it because I wanted to see Gerard Butler, but I can honestly say that once the movie started (and he doesn't appear until about 45 minutes into the film) I was so engrossed in the story that the original reason didn't even exist anymore.I have never seen Emily Mortimer in a film before (except her tiny part in Notting Hill,) but I was very impressed with the heart and realism that she brought to her role, as well as the actress who played her mother. Young Jack McElhone was especially impressive. You could see why his mother wanted to protect him so much and you could understand why The Stranger wanted to extend the time he spent with him.Critic Roger Ebert mentioned a scene in a doorway with Lizzie and The Stranger. He talked about the way a powerful scene does not need a lot of dialogue. I watched especially for that scene and completely agreed with his comments on its profundity. This was a beautiful film and I'm so glad that I saw it. It was sweet, simple, real, and powerful in many ways. It was the kind of film that will stay with you for several days. That is what good film-making is all about and it is refreshing to see one as high quality as DEAR FRANKIE. Enjoy-",Dear Frankie
719470,"The fact that this movie even got made is a miracle. It's not perfect, but you have to realise how the US Gov't ""intelligence"" services (which we fund w/ our taxes) tried amazing disinformation, threats and lies to keep not only the honest folks of Roswell doubting their sanity, but all of America as well.

It shows an entire Christian concert that took place in the city of Jerusalem itself.  Jerusalem looked like a really neat place, with modern highways and a few old, old buildings.  I'm talking OLD.  The venue for the concert is one of these OLD places.There's a whole variety of songs featured here.  Some are very powerful and moving, focusing the overwhelming grace of God, and then there are other songs that are just plain fun like, ""Hey Moses, Take Your Shoes Off.""  I think my favorite is, ""Can't Stop Talking About Him,"" which is a song that's more on the fun side.Most of the songs are original, but there are a few classics like, ""It Is Well With My Soul.""  I really like those.I am pleased with this Gaither product.  It's really good if you want to see a group of Christians experiencing joy through musical worship.On a side note, I kept thinking through the whole concert that one of the singers REALLY looked like the stereotypical picture of Jesus, with the beard and long hair and big smile.

131204,"As far as adaptations of old American novels go, Tim Burton's visually rich, tightly composed, resplendent version of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' ranks in the top echelon.  The script for the screen is the work of Kevin Yagher  and Andrew Kevin Walker and while it takes some liberties from Irving's story, the resulting dialogue and action pacing are so wholly in keeping with Burton's vision that it feels like an original story.Much of the magnificence of this film is due to the atmospheric set design by Rick Heinrichs (with art direction by Ken Court, John Dexter, and Andy Nicholson with set decoration by Peter Young) and  Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes.  It is not usual to credit these artists when reviewing a film, but their contributions are an integral part of the success of the movie.As far as acting, Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane shines in a fully nuanced character portrayal complete with paraphernalia and ticks and mild madness.  He is ably supported by Christina Ricci (in one of her finest moments), and a troupe of brilliant actors that includes Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid.  They appear as though they are daguerreotypes, so perfectly in keeping with the time and period and mannerisms of Irving's novel.

422824,"When I first saw Sling Blade back in 1996, I was immensely moved by Thornton's portrayal of a mentally retarded man trying to assimilate into the world from which he was cast years ago for killing his mother and her lover. It was, to me, a perfect movie from beginning to end. The movement was precise; all of the situations (unfortunately) highly believable, and the acting, from Thornton to John Ritter to Lucas Black was terrific. Lucas Black, incidentally, seems to be making the transition from child star to adult actor quite well. So many ""cute kids"" that can act like ""cute kids"" grow into ungainly adults who can't act like adults. He's breaking that mold, and perhaps it's because he was never under the intense scrutiny that others like Macaulay Culkin were.Anyway, I'm digressing in a huge way.Having seen this recently on cable, I was surprised at how strongly certain images remained from my first viewing. Frank (Lucas Black) tossing huge bags of laundry out of the Laundromat, the cot that Karl (Thornton) slept on, originally, in the back of the garage he worked at, the horrible scene where Doyle (played to oily perfection by Dwight Yoakam) flew into a drunken rage and shoved Linda (Frank's mom, Natalie Canerday), whereupon Frank viciously attacked Doyle by throwing everything he could get his hands on at him. That was such a brilliant and moving scene. As was the scene where Karl grabbed Doyle's hand and said something like, ""Don't you lay a hand on that boy"".However, while watching it, I realized that I had missed a rather major plot line, the entire reason that Karl and Frank bonded the way the way they did. I'm chalking it up to being nine years dumber than I am today, but that's just a convenient excuse. I missed it, and, uh, all I can say about that is ""duh!"".What I missed is rather simple, and may come as no surprise to anyone reading this. Karl, under direction from his parents, drowned his younger brother and buried him alive. Retarded and young as he was, he didn't have a complete grasp on the situation, but over the years, he came to realize that what he did was wrong. On Frank's end, his father killed himself. Rather simple here. Karl found the little brother he wanted as well as his perceptive abilities could grasp, and Frank found the father he desperately missed and needed. Without that core, the movie really lacks coherency. So for me to have missed that and still enjoyed the film immensely - well, like I said earlier, duh. My only complaint about the missing father figure was that John Ritter's character, who was gay, could easily have been a father figure to Frank. Being gay didn't disqualify him. Let's get serious - if being gay disqualifies, even in young Frank's mind, wouldn't a socially inept retarded person be disqualified too? That's a minor problem, though.Going back to powerful images, anyone who has seen this film is not likely to forget the ending, where Karl calmly goes from place to place, extracting promises from various people so that he and Doyle will be alone later that night. Karl calmly asks Doyle how to reach the police, and once Doyle tells him, Karl calmly stands up, kills him with what I guess is a sling blade (I admit ignorance here), then calls the police, reports a murder, and says that with the second blow he nearly cleaved Doyle's head in two. After reporting the murder, he sits down and finishes eating dinner.Later, upon being readmitted to the mental institution, we are confronted with the most disgusting of criminals - and I'm not even certain why this particular criminal was institutionalized, unless he had a great lawyer - the child molester. This man is talking to Karl about his ""exploits"", which are revolting, and asks if Karl had met anyone on the ""outside"". Karl says he met a boy, and the molester indicates that he doesn't go that way, but was sure that Karl had a good time with him. Karl replies, and I'm paraphrasing liberally, ""Don't you never say nothin' `bout that boy. As a matter of fact, I'd appreciate it if you don't say `nothing to me at all.""Retarded, yes. Immoral? That's a more difficult question. The Bible told him that killing was wrong, but obviously he somehow worked out that in certain matters killing was OK (he said to his father that he would kill him where he sat, but he saw that his father was doing a fine job of it himself).This was the first time I'd seen Billy Bob Thornton, although he'd appeared in and/or written seventeen films prior. Having never seen him, I had no idea how remarkable his acting was. After seeing him in other films, his performance here put Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man to shame.",N/A

I have to agree with some other reviewers and say that there was a lot of silence in the film, but the music that played in the background was awesome!!I think that both main actors, Cameron Bright, and Nicole Kidman did a great job in working with the script.A little weird, but when you are working with type of material, what is to be expected?Worst part of the film...the ending!!! Kinda left you hanging!!",N/A
59680,"Jennifer Lopez breathes a whole lot of life into Elmore Leonard's powerful DA Karen Sisco.  Worth noting off the top of things is that J.lo's character in this movie was not meant to be a Latina.Nevertheless, the movie gives is plenty of great shots of J.lo's lower half, usually dressed in one heck of a power suit.Although the Elmore Novel book was the source material, and the movie stays relatively true to it's origins, the ending was changed a bit and we are treated to a much more intense version of the relationship between the two main characters, played by George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.Clooney had just established his ""bad ass"" credentials with ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"" and does a tremendous role as the lovable scumbag in this movie, having us follow along in his misadventures as he is sent to prison for bank robbing, escapes with his Cuban inmate buddies, then spends the rest of his time trying to evade the law AND plan that last great final heist at the same time.Meanwhile, Karen Sisco is going cross country trying to take this guy down, but is also having to face up to the fact that criminal losers are her type of man.The movie thus follows the route of our anti-heroes from Florida in December to a wintery Detroit, where a heist, hook up and final climactic confrontation all occur.This movie features spectacular performances by character actors Ving Rhames (Clooney's sidekick), Don Cheadle (Clooney's rival), and (surprisingly) strong performances by Jennifer Lopez (this is her best role ever) and of course, George Clooney (who is at his sleazeball charming best).The movie follows the plot of the book incredibly well, save for the ending. Also worth noting was that J.lo's character from this movie proved so likeable, that a TV show based on the character was created.SO, if you like Elmore Leonard, Jennifer Lopez or think that Clooney is best when he's breaking the law, this is your type of popcorn fare.",N/A

It is a love story that deals with Michael Ontkean's stuggle in ""coming out"" (he is married to Kate Jackson)  but meets and has a major attraction to Harry Hamlin.  While flawed in some ways, it still comes across as a very sensitive film that deals with a very sensitive & emotional issue that is still as timely as ever.

139859,"This would have to be one of the most overrated and overhyped movies ever produced. It concerns a drunken loser by the name of Ben, played by Nicholas Cage who is set on drinking himself to death in Las Vegas. Instead ofbeing totally absorbed in his quest to find his next drink (just like any normal drunk) he finds time to develop a relationship with Sera, a prostitute. I have read that prostitutes  HATE DRUNKS for various reasons which I won't go into in this review but this movie does call for an immense ""Suspension Of Disbelief "" on the part of the viewer like the scene in which Ben wakes up smiling after a hard night of drinking. Somebody should tell the makers of this turkey of a movie that no drunk ever wakes up smiling (and happy , no less!!!) after a drinking binge.I give this movie 5 stars because I kind of like Elisabeth Shue.What I really want to know is that how come every streetwalker portrayed by Hollywood is always good looking whereas in reality they are all Heroin addicts with Hepatitis B which has eroded any good looks they may once have had?

399640,"The movie starts with a bellhop starting his shift. He is the night bellhop in what seems to be a high class hotel. He is the only one working that night and has to contend with four different roooms (not all at the same time) which is where the name comes from. Each room has its own segment and is written by a different writer. The first two I don't remember who did them, but the last two are done by Robert Rodriguez(#3) and Quentin Tarintino(#4).Now that all of the rooms are fun to watch. The first room is horrible and contains one of the worst actresses in the world, Maddona. Stay away from this room and don't bother watching it. Basically it features a group of witches attempting to resurrect their leader. They all bring different items but one of them doesn't. She needed to bring sperm but didn't, so guess who is going to give them some? That's right the bellhop. She doesn't want to take advantage of him but is forced to. There is some nudity in this scene(and it is a beautiful women who is nude) but that would be the only reason to watch this scene, and I say just fast forward until you get to it.The second room contains a couple who are in the middle of a major conflict. The bellhop walks into the room to find the husband with a gun and the wife tied up. The husband is accusing the bellhop of committing adultery with his wife. He denies it and they go back and force. The bellhop gains his trust then loses it, and back and force like that. It was quite funny but not my favorite.The third room contains Antonio Banderas(I don't think I spelled his name right) and an actress playing his wife. They want to go out but they have two childen, a young son and older daughter. These two children are trouble and you can tell from the moment they appear on the screen. Now in order to get away from their children they pay the bellhop to check on them every hour. The parents leave, mischief occurs, children don't listen, and more mischief happens. Loved this scene, one of Robert Rodriguez's greatest works. The only thing of his I liked more was From Dusk til' Dawn.Then there is an intermission where the bellhop complains to the pothead manager of the hotel, who is played hilariously by Kathy Griffin. Good break up from the rooms that perfectly sets up the final and greatest room of the movie.The final room was written and stars Quetin Tarintino. Quentin plays a famous actor who rented the penthouse with a bunch of his friends. They are drunk and bored and asked the bellhop for what seems to be a bunch of random items. When he delivers these he is instantly greeted by a drunk and merry Quentin. He invites him to drink a little with him and another of his friends, while Bruce Willis argues with his wife on the phone in the bedroom. Eventually he asks to the bellhop to help out in an outrageous bet with crazy circumstances(don't want to give it away) and the bellhop eventually after much begging to do it.That is the basic plot. It is a good comedy and for a little more than 10 bucks it is a great addition to anyone's DVD collection. Get it, skip the first room, and enjoy.",Four Rooms VHS

It's such a beautiful story and with an incredible ensemble. You would think they would have taken the time to make a nice package for the fans. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Even so, I am glad to see this movie at last on DVD.  Again, this is a great storyline. It is the story of a Unicorn who goes off to find the other unicorns in the world.

15187,"Like Gena Rowlands in this country (who ironically did a similar film, 1996's ""Unhook the Stars""), Brazil's Fernanda Montenegro is a masterful actress who inhabits her characters wholly with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of personal depth. In this beautifully filmed 1998 film directed by Walter Salles, she offers a superbly realistic portrayal of an aging, embittered spinster named Dora, who earns money by writing letters for illiterate passers-by at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station. At the outset, she is a petty thief who takes the letters and decides with her friend Irene which ones to post if at all. Her dull world changes when Josu&eacute;, the nine year-old son of a woman for whom Dora has written a letter, suddenly becomes orphaned when the woman is killed by a speeding bus. The letter was to be sent to Josu&eacute;'s father to reunite the family. Now his plight gradually becomes Dora's concern, and over the course of the film, her destiny.What Salles does with great dexterity is show the gradual closeness between Dora and Josu&eacute; without resorting to any obvious sentimental plot devices, as neither is particularly sympathetic at the beginning and use their surly, obstinate personalities as protective shells. Even though this story has an overly familiar structure, Salles and screenwriters Joo Emanuel Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein bring a heavy dose of neo-realism within the unfamiliar, non-tourist locales used. It's all reminiscent of Vittorio de Sica's and Roberto Rosellini's classic post-WWII work in Italy like ""The Bicycle Thief"" and ""Open City"". With his later film, 2004's wonderful ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" and now slated to film Jack Keroauc's seminal ""On the Road"", Salles is obviously becoming known as a master of the road movie, and it is easy to see why with this work. Helping considerably is the stunning cinematography of Walter Carvalho, who presents vividly inhabited tableaux with each new phase of the journey from the bustle of inner-city Rio to the open roads to the religious pilgrimage to the new shoebox-style settlement.But it is Montenegro who dominates the proceedings as she gradually develops a character who earns our sympathy economically and honestly as she makes every moment count. For example, as she senses herself becoming attracted to Cesar, the religious truck driver, she applies a stranger's lipstick with a quivering hesitation that is almost as heartbreaking as the realization she faces moments later that he has left for good. A real shoeshine boy picked by Salles, Vin&iacute;cius de Oliveira plays Josu&eacute; with equal economy and responds to Dora's actions with realism that alternates between touching and frustrating. Smaller roles are filled expertly with Mar&iacute;lia Pra amusingly ebullient as Irene and Othon Bastos compellingly conflicted as Cesar. The climax comes a bit out of left field with the introduction of new characters that provide some amount of closure to Josu&eacute;'s fate and wrap up many of the open plot threads, but the somewhat pat turn does not undermine the genuine strength of the film.The DVD provides a nice extra with Montenegro, Salles, and producer Arthur Cohn contributing invaluable audio commentary in English. Salles and Cohn talk about the sources of inspiration for the movie as well as the more technical aspects including the rigors of location shooting with masses of amateur actors and a minimum of art direction and constructed sets. Montenegro speaks less, but like her performance, makes all her comments resonate. It's interesting how variations of the film's basic plot have come up in recent years - for instance, Jan Sver&aacute;k's 1996 ""Kolya"" from the Czech Republic and Takeshi Kitano's 2000 ""Kikujiro"" from Japan - and this one certainly holds up well as a prototype.",N/A

907682,"Constantine is the story of a demonologist/exorcist who was born with the unique and uncanny abilities to see and combat demons(and angels), and other creatures from hell. The story begins with the finding of the ""Sword of Destiny"" - the sword that was used to spear Jesus Christ on the Cross at Calvary - and ends with John Constantine battled none other than Lucifer himself.Constantine moves along at a good pace and provides an immersive story that will keep you engrossed. There are grand battles with flying demons, and a good working chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Rachal Weisz. Overall, you will walk away from Constantine having been entertained as well as glad you stepped into the fictional world of the ""Hellblazer.""There are some weak spots to the film. Keanu Reeves was generally very convining, but had moments (especially when he was smoking cigarettes) where he seemed a little off. There were also some blatant inconsistancies that can leave the audience scratching their collective heads. For example: in the first 45 minutes of Constantine, John Constantine is continuously smoking cigarettes, and we are shown (quite often) the severity of his lung cancer. Then, for seemingly no reason, this character issue is forgotten. There is no hint of cigarettes or lung cancer until one of the last scenes.Despite these odd defects, Constantine is worth viewing.Total Score (out of 100) = 7138 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

713359,"This film was a major hit upon release in the summer of `79.  With a budget seven-million-dollars, the film took in over $40 million at the domestic box office and became one of the top-ten grossers of the year.  Unfortunately, it has since been written off by many fans and critics alike as one of Streisand's weakest film efforts.  As for myself, I believe THE MAIN EVENT manages to be likable, funny, and entertaining.  Even though we've seen the same story a thousand times before, THE MAIN EVENT is very enjoyable while it's playing.The scenes are all set up very well, the one-liners are funny (""I said celebrate, not fornicate ""), and Streisand and O'Neal give off a strong sexual charge between them onscreen.  The film also features a very strong supporting cast, with Paul Sand, Whitman Mayo, and Patti D'Arbanville turning in terrific performances.  Unfairly mangled by most critics and many viewers (many of whom need to learn how to loosen up), the film is complete fun from start to finish.  Ignore all of the naysayers, THE MAIN EVENT stands one of my favorite romantic comedies.About the DVD:  The picture quality is great, and the mono sound is fine as well.  It's great to have the original trailer and the 19-minute television special, titled GETTING IN SHAPE FOR THE MAIN EVENT, preserved on disc, although Streisand's brief audio commentary is slightly disappointing.",The Main Event

Kest is a fabulous instructor who narrates his class with a clean sense of timing and a knack for saying what the student needs to hear at the precise moment. If you are a total beginner, however, this may not be the best place to start, because all three sessions are fairly challenging, and the pace is too fast for somebody who is still learning the sequence of a vinyasa. For the intermediate student, however, I cannot recommend this instruction highly enough. The sequencing just ""feels right""; it flows naturally.

816485,"Hayao Miyazaki has many hobbies, and these show up in the long list of themes in his movies.His movies almost always have a strong female lead. This is because he's a feminist. He loves machines, especially airplanes and the entire field of aviation. He loves bizarre and cute creatures, and likes to include tough old men (like himself) as the mentor or teacher. This movie was one written for Miyazaki. He made a movie he wanted to see. In fact, it was originaly written for business men and airplane enthusiasts, as he said in an interview after its release. Yet, because it's such a good story, and the feelings involved are all good ones, all ages love this movie. As I have said, and will, these Disney re-masters (Cat Returns, Nausicaa, Porco) all are a great addition for family, Ghibli fans, or anyone who like animation and great stories.Porco Rosso is the story of Marco, a man changed into a pig by a strange curse after the war. It takes place in the Mediterranian, over the Adriatic Sea, then takes us to Milan in Italy during the 1930's. All of these are beautifully done, so much so that you may just want to visit the ocean. And the period deals with (basically only touches on) the fascism in Italy at the time. But, now that he's a pig, and no longer a soldier (because of the regime), he has become a seaplane bounty hunter, under the name 'Porco Rosso' (thats crimson pig in italian). When the sea pirates he hunts band with a hotshot american pilot named Donald Curtis, Porco and Curtis are more than ready to meet in the sky. After an amazing dogfight sequence with Curtis, Porco's plane needs repairs, so he heads to Milan where his mechanic Piccolo resides. Once there, he meets old man Piccolo's gorgeous granddaughter Fio. She's only 17, and for her first job, she may just have to engineer Porco's entire plane. This is only the first third, and there are so many more points, but the story is never too confusing, or convoluted. Anyone can follow it and it never gets too adult either.The quality is great, anyone who has seen Kiki's Delivery Service or some of the other Ghibli films with the European cityscapes, these are done by the same amazing art director. He has such detail, from the middle of the ocean, to Milan, everything is crisp and well colored. They show up beautifully on this version, and Disney really out did themselves with such a good transfer. They have kept the film intact, but without any pops, jitters, or fuzz. The sound is great, another one with a grand score. If you have surround sound this one is probably the best for effects, plus the orchestral score just pops out, making the flight scenes as moving as the romantic ones.The special features are the standard for these collections, with language options and subtitles, japanese TV trailers and spot, and 2 more familiar featurettes.This time, it's the Behind the Microphone from the other Disney releases, only they seem to cover a lot more of the voice replacement process. It features Michael Keaton of Batman fame as Porco, Susan Egan (meg from hercules) as Gina, Cary Elwes (from Saw) as Curtis, the Mamma Aiuto Boss by Brad Garret from Everybody loves Raymond, David Ogden Stiers as Grandpa Piccolo (he is so many disney voices, and Winchester from the MASH series). One thing it left out was the french dub they did, which featured many famous french actors including Jean Reno as Porco, but maybe they did a PAL version with french features...Second on the featurette list is an interview with the producer, Toshio Suzuki. This is informative and funny, and if you are a Ghibli fan, this is sure to please.(Not as good as the one on Nausicaa though)The second disc rounds out Extras with a Complete Storyboard. Again, this is the audio from the movie to Miyzaki's own drawings and boards. Think audio comic. Not all that grand for specials and that's why it lost a star. In another ten years, the second disc will be bigger I'm sure, and I will not feel so bad about taking a star away. But you just exoect more with two discs, and for such an amazin movie, they should be rolling out lots more red carpet. Overall, a fantastic movie worth buying, and if you don't get any of these Miyazaki movies, try your best to SEE this one. Or, do like me and buy them all....",N/A
825722,"The answer that the Children of the Damned give to that question is the most interesting.There are only four years between the classic British horror film Village of the Damned (1960) and the sequel, Children of the Damned (1964), but when you watch both movies you see that there's at least a decade (maybe a whole generation) separating them.Children of the Damned is one of those rare horror sequels that has more ideas in it than the original (like The Rage: Carrie 2, Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed, and Vampires: Los Muertos, for instance, all of which are worth seeing).Village is an old-fashioned fifties movie; Children is a modern sixties film.Village is a rural story; Children is urban.Village has blond alien children who all look alike; Children shows a multiethnic and multinational group of children with different skin colors and languages but the same Mind.Village is the story of an alien invasion; the Children are ""genetic sports"" that may be the next step in human evolution - - not Them, but Us.The ""Midwich Cuckoos"" in Village of the Damned are a murderous threat to the adult humans around them; The Children of the Damned are the victims, not the aggressors.In Village, the worst threat from the children is to the ""natural"" family (father, mother, child); In Children there are no ""natural"" families except for the one the Children make to protect themselves.In the Cold War 1950s in the Village of the Damned, authorities in Great Britain (the freedom-loving West) at first only want to study the children, but they receive word that ""behind the Iron Curtain"" Communist leaders with no regard for human life have tried to massacre ""their children"" when they couldn't be controlled.But by the 1960s the Children of the Damned have seen the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the start of the Vietnam War. The Cold War isn't a struggle between good and evil, it's a feud between two greedy superpowers. Now the generals of both East and West try to murder the ""their own"" children rather than let their superhuman mental powers fall into enemy hands. The children have other ideas, and the film makes it clear they (the children) are only protecting themselves. Every time the children strike out, the authorities (usually British) have tried to harm them first.Paul's mother (shown as a tramp - - ""I think we can safely say that he didn't get his brains from mother"") is under his mental control and she says to him, ""I want you to suffer the way you've made me suffer."" Then Paul plants the idea in her mind of walking into a tunnel in front of a truck. But nothing else Paul or any other of the children do is violent except in self-defense. We see other children (mostly from poor families, unlike the Midwich middle class) who seem to love their parents and whose parents seem to love them without being telepathically controlled. Maybe Paul is just defending himself against an abusive mother. (One theme of this movie is MOTHERS ARE BAD. There's really only one good mother in the movie, and he's a man.)Two male scientist ""friends"" (a psychologist and a geneticist) who live together discover the children's powers. (One scene shows them coming out separate bedrooms at night, but they're not fooling anyone. The geneticist walks around the flat carrying a frying pan and trying to strike a balance between Basil Rathbone and Oscar Wilde.)The geneticist is Oxbridge English while the psychologist is Welsh with an accent - - not ""one of us.""The geneticist wants to destroy the children as a threat to homo sapiens' domination of the planet. (""It's the law of nature - - ask any ape."")But the psychologist asks what if they just want to be poets or lovers? (""Nowadays we find a better use for Shakespeare and Casanova."")The climax of the movie may not be what a logical species would do in trying to protect itself, but maybe the children are operating with a different logic than we understand. By the time the final conflagration unites the East and West in more ways than one, it's more important for the film to show the inescapable conclusion of the insanity that's gone before.",N/A

My rating 8.71/10.Match Two-Cruiserweight Championship-Spike Dudley(C)Vs Nunzio-This was a pleasantly good match and it had some interference which really spiced this nice match up. Hopefully WWE continue to have lots of cruiserweight matches as they're really good. My rating 8.81/10.Match Three-Billy Kidman Vs Paul London-This was excellent,two cruiserweight matches in a row,now thats good. This had some great high flying moves and a great ending with it. It had some aftermath which was great and I thoroughly enjoyed this match with its fast paced action. My rating 8.91/10.Match Four-WWE Tag Team Championship-Kenzo Suzuki & Rene Dupre(C)Vs RVD & Rey Mysterio-This was a fastly paced match with some nice action and some good spots. It wasn't the greatest match these four coud have put on but it was still very good indeed. I hope these two teams continue to feud amongst themselves and with other teams as its really enjoyable and exciting. My rating 8.86/10.Match Five-Big Show Vs Kurt Angle-This match was great compared to most of Big Show's matches. Kurt and Show put on a great performance here and it really showed big time. Great spots,bumps and action throughout this match. Show and Kurt should really continue this, as its exciting and they could really go somewhere with it. My rating 8.95/10.Match Six-US Title-Booker T(C)Vs John Cena-This was the fifth and final match in these two mens series of matches for the US title. The action was back and forfth and you couldn't guess the winner til the bell rung to signal the winner. It was an excellent match with some great action. Keep up the great work men. My rating 8.99/10.Match Seven-Jackie,Rico & Charlie Haas Vs D-Von Dudley,Buh Buh Ray Dudley & Dawn Marie-This match was announced a week or two prior to this event with Dawn spiling the beans about Charlie and Jackie being engaged. The match itself wasn't that great but it was still enjoyable and helped the crowd get excited for the main event. My rating 7.41/10.Match Eight-Main Event-Last Ride Match-WWE Championship-JBL(C)Vs The Undertaker-This was purely brutal with everything they could do being done in this match. Tombstones,Chokeslams and everything,chair shots, stairs used anything used in this brutal match. It was absolutely great and the ending did what it needed to,setting up future feuds. A great main event to end a very good show. My rating 9.76/10.In my opinion No Mercy 2004 was a great show with lots of very good matches with a great main event. Now lets see how it scored, the score is in and it is 70.30 out of 80 which is equal to 87.87%. Thats a great score which is equal to an A-. I hope this review helps you, feel free to vote on this or any other of my reviews.",WWE No Mercy 2004
183078,"I bought this because I love Dvorak, and know little or nothing about his operas...I confess I began to watch it without reading the plot synopsis...tried to figure out what was going on without it...I think it's a reasonable expectation that one should be able to understand the plot that way.  So...what's with this girl in the swing, and the pond in the middle of the bedroom floor?  OK...it's a modern interpretation...oh, she's a water nymph, and she's sitting in a tree. It's not that her bedroom has flooded; it's a woodland pond.  Sigh. I hate these modern versions--a fairy tale should be a fairy tale, and in the case of an opera like this, which is not as well known as most, most viewers will (like me) never have seen it before, so why not go with a real tree, a pond, etc.?  This modern nonsense spoils it. Can we expect to see Hansel and Gretel set in the South Bronx? Also, I agree with others...just because it's sung in English (why on earth?) doesn't mean it doesn't need subtitles.  I can only catch about half of the words.  The music is great, and the singing is OK (the prince is too old and too fat to be her love object), but overall it's a disappointment",N/A

The most remarkable thing about this movie is that it was shot in the studio - in the hands of any team other than Powell and Pressburger and Cardiff this would be a serious problem - but here the set design, surprisingly, adds more to the way this film looks than it takes away - it is not the material the artist uses but how he or she uses it. This story about a nunnery run amok is as hilarious as it is intriguing - at times I found myself just delighted by the naughty sister Ruth, who is overcome by her wild desires - there is but a very small step between the innocent and the possessed",N/A

Bedford, New York. Samantha is being raised by her grandmother as her parents died in a boat accident while she was an infant. As the movie begins Samantha is playing with Eddie Rylan, her neighbor. Samantha's grandmother is raising her to take her place in society, however Samantha likes to run, jump and climb trees, quite the contrast to what her GrandMary has in mind. The Rylan's have recently hired an Irish immigrant family from New York City to serve as their live in servants. The family is comprised of a widower,Mr. O'Malley and his three daughters, Nellie, Bridget and Jenny. The family had lived in New York City where the girls worked in a thread factory to support their family. After meeting the O'Malley's Samantha's Uncle Gardner comes to visit with his fiancee' Corneila. Samantha is not pleased with their engagement, but over time accepts Corneila as part of their family and even gives Corneila her mother's wedding veil after hers is destroyed by fire. Samantha moves to New York City to live with Uncle Garnder and Aunt Cornelia while GrandMary leaves to visit relatives out of state. While living in New York Samantha discovers that the O'Malley sisters have lost their father and are living at Cold Rock Orphange which is controlled by the nasty Mrs. Frouchy. Samantha also discovers that Mrs. Frouchy is embellzing money from the orphange and has plans to split up the O'Malley sisters by sending Nellie on the orphan train. Samantha and Nellie plan for the girls escape, which leads them to Uncle Gardner and Aunt Corneila's attic. All is going well until Bridget becomes sick, leaving Samantha to confess to her Aunt and Uncle what she has done. In the meantime Gardner and Cornelia learn of what really goes on at Cold Rock Orphange and through Mrs. Vandergelds assistance bring an end to the reign of Mrs. Frouchy. In the end Uncle Gardner and Aunt Corneila ask Samantha to stay with them permanently as GrandMary is getting married. On Christmas morning there is a surprise for everyone, Gardner and Corneila are planning to adopt the O'Malley girls so Samantha will have sisters and they will be a family.This movie was faithful to the original books, the screenplay, casting, directing and musical score are brillant!This movie is one you will want to watch again and again with your family.",Samantha - An American Girl Holiday
604670,"This film has haunting music, great special effects, and terrific themes. The DVD has incredible extras. The menus are improved over the first version, and there are more deleted scenes. It could be the last TNG movie, but the door is open for sequels and crossovers with other Trek series. There is also a lot of character development. There's also a lot of mythology included, especially in regards to B-4 from TNG episode, ""Inheritance."" I only wish they would have expanded the Romulan mythology more, by adding Tomalok or Sela or even Spock to the movie.

Along with his pals (""droogs"" as he calls 'em), Alex sets out on his daily mission to fulfill his life by robbing, beating, raping, and killing his prey. He is the ""ID"" unleashed, the animal throwback, the barbarian let loose upon society! Alex is a walking nightmare! The most terrifying thing about him though, is just how damned likeable he is! He is an enigma, a lover of Ludwig Von Beethoven with a taste for extreme wickedness. His voice and mannerisms are so refined, so poetic, as to lure us into his world, only to find out too late that he is reprehensible! Alex is charismatic and attractive too. He cruises along on a plane of existence somewhere within the shadows of our own, slithering through our universe like the world's most beautiful reptile. I first saw this movie when I was 10 (way back in '72). Me and my friends snuck into see it at the theatre and spent the summer roaming alleys, pretending to be Alex and company. I've since seen it again and consider it to be a work of evil genius, so very far ahead of it's time that it's yet to be outdated! I find myself hating Alex's actions, while feeling pity for him during his betrayal, imprisonment, and eventual swan-dive out that window! Yep, Alex finds himself caught in the cold claws of something far more evil than himself. Becoming nothing more than a laboratory animal for government experiments. A perverse poster-child for the political gain of others.  If you love social satire, or irreverence mixed with sex and violence, then A CLOCKWORK ORANGE will scratch that itch!

Or the episode where Murphy is trying to find the ""pro shop"".  Or ""TinFins"".  And don't let me forget the BIZARRO episode.  I don't think any one of these 13 episodes is weak unlike a few on the season one collection.  Plus bonus material this time, such as containing an unaired ""rough"" episode where Murphy sells his soul to the devil for some pie.  Funny.

52618,"Yes, Eddie Murphy is amazingly chameleonic in this reworking of Jerry Lewis' classic 1963 comedy.  Unfortunately, Eddie's not totally funny in this crass update.  If you're into flatulence or fat jokes, then this movie is right up your alley.  But its threadbare plot takes second place to Eddie's mugging not only of his title character and alter ego, but also all of the Klumps as well.  Jada Pinkett is the customary African/American woman who does her best (Like Halle Berry or Vanessa Williams) to look as Caucasian as she can.  The late James Coburn as a cameo role as a hotshot millionaire out to fund Murphy's research project, and Dave Chappelle has a bit as a stand up comic who is not all that funny either.  While the intentions are good, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR of 1996 doesn't capture the manic charisma of the one and only Jerry Lewis whose mugging was more charming than obnoxious.",N/A

806727,"A Hero: a maiden fair; a castle; the ingenues - male and female; battles by sword, bow and arrow, fire; horses in their finery - ---- and ta-da! Time Travel!!The time travel is what fans of the book were looking for but to me was the least interesting part of an old-fashioned 'Errol Flynn' movie.  The buckles were swashing all over the place as we had sword fights.  We had castles under seige by fire, raining arrows, and catapulting balls of explosive fire.  We had the chaos of the final bridging of the walls and the two sides engaged in one on one combat.In the 'Flynn' part we had Gerard Butler, and he was a fine romantic lead.  Our fair lady was Anna Friel as Lady Claire.  Their sweet story is played out in way to short a time.The ingenues are Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor.  Attractive, but bland and banal.  Way too much of the film is watching them run here and there.Since this was based on a novel, I suppose they had to follow the time travel plot.  But the romantic 'Flynn' type swashbuckling story with the costumes, castles, horses  and scenery would have been a better film.  7/10",N/A
853418,"I really feel they should put a better title on this movie. It doesn't say anything about being set in modern times - but it most definitely is. Not only that, but it's set in Salt Lake City, Utah. It's a very funny movie, but it's not an actual adaptation of the book :)In this version, Elizabeth Bennett is a blonde writer going to school at BYU. Jane is her Argentinian roommate. Lydia, Kitty and Mary are all in the story too, retaining their general characteristics. The Bingleys are a rich pair who breeze into town, along of course with Darcy, who owns a publishing firm.There are parts of the movie that I love - and others that really bug me a lot. For example, Lydia and Kitty maliciously do various things to try to muscle in on Jane and Elizabeth's beaus. That's completely against the ""regular"" storyline, where the family was generally supportive and helpful. That's what made some of the scenes so poignant, that Lizzie loved her family dearly even as they embarassed her.On the other hand, though, when Mary is making a fool of herself musically, it's Lizzie who gets up on stage and rescues her, not the father. So they make an effort to show more of Lizzie's tender side. They also introduce Wickham right at the beginning, as a long term friend of Lizzie's. That strikes me better than having Lizzie start getting friendly with a guy her sisters are already interested in.There are no parents at all in this story - the kids are all on their own completely. Parents are, if anything, a nebulous ""expectation generator"" somewhere offstage. I really felt sad at that too, because the father and mother are such meaningful characters in the story. It's as if they made this story for teens who didn't want to deal with parents any more. In the original story, the parents, aunts and uncles all played important roles. In this one, not even Collins is related any more.Other changes were made that I didn't agree with. Collins publicly humiliates Elizabeth, which is *extremely* ungentlemanly and quite against his character. Darcy had nothing to do really with dragging Bingley away from Jane! Caroline explicitly lied to Elizabeth about being engaged to Darcy? They were changes that weren't necessary, and that turned characters into ""black"" or ""white"" - it lost a great deal of the gorgeous character depth in the story.On the other hand, there were several scenes where I laughed out loud. The little scene-titles that introduce sections of the story are often hilarious. There are a ton of subtle references to the original story. This can be a downfall, though. People who know the story well laugh right away at certain circumstances, understanding the meaning. If you hadn't read the book, you miss those items and the movie seems far more shallow because of it.A film for occasional watching, but not one to treasure like other versions of Price & Prejudice that exist.",N/A

622734,"I'm a big Ben Stiller fan so I obvioulsy was excited to see this movie. But unlike the rest of his movies, this one is forgetable and pretty lame. The movie is about a guy who gets a real low blow when his wife cheats on him on their honeymoon. So this uptight guy who hates spicy foods now is single and sad and frustrated. He then meets Polly, a neat girl that's kind of the opposite of him because she's free and does whatever she wants while he's really uptight.The movie just wasn't funny and was just pointless and weird. It was very simple and predictable and after the movie I was like:""along came who?"" This isn't worth even a rent because it's not funny at all. The only funny moments that I recall are:1. Stiller's crazy white friend screams ""White Chocolate"" while going up for a layup in a basketball game where he throws the ball off the backboard.2. A shirtless really hair dude runs into Stiller and his hair rubs against Stiller's face.3. Stiller spanks Aniston while they're making love because his friend told him to do so. She looks at him strangely and he says it was a twitch.That's all that I remember that was funny.

636493,"""The Skeleton Key"" is a strange movie. It is a horror film that relies more on psychological horror than normal horror that invades most horror movies these days. It is a ghost story, although the ghosts are never seen as ghosts. The script, penned by ""Ring""-master Ehren Kruger, is effectively terrifying. The acting is great, and the Louisiana town the film is set in is atmospheric and just back-woodsy enough. When the movies falters, the slightest bit that is, it is in the twist ending that makes little sense. But it fits with the rest of the movie. It, too, makes little sense and in scenes such as a club scene and a scene at a gas station seem like they don't really fit into the movie and are only there for the sole purpose of, respectfully, showing a hip, trendy atmosphere and it also being a way to showcase the movie's theme song. And the last is just to scare the audience. Gena Rowlands is good in a supportiing role, but is stuck with bad lines (""Child, I do believe that you broke my legs. Now it's time to pay!""). The script is good, although not frightening, it has some well staged scenes. Although the violence goes way overboard in the last third (broken legs, lynchings, burnings, shootings, strangulations, stabbings, dismemberment) the movie never loses its pacing and stays satisfyingly dark throughout.Caroline (Kate Hudson) is a hospice worker that regrets not caring for her late father. She gets a job at the Deveraux manse caring for Ben (John Hurt) who suffered a stroke after seeing something shocking in a mirror. Violet (Rowlands) thinks that Caroline will not understand the house. Violet tells Caroline that there used to be a family of rich white bankers that lived in the house. One night, while having a party, the parting guests wanted to bid fairwell to the children. They find them sitting in a hoodoo circle with the servants Mamma Cecile and Papa Justify. The family and guests lynch the servants, whose spirits now haunt the house and appear in all the mirrors in the home. Hoodoo, Caroline finds out, is different than voodoo. Voodoo is more of a religion associated with God. Hoodoo is associated with the fact that, if a person was killed in the write way in a Circle Of Life, the years on the late persons life will be added to the killers, keeping them safe from anything. Caroline becomes entrenched in the hoodoo phenomenon. Peter Saarsgaard appears as a lawyer that helps Caroline.Their is a twist in the end that is unexplainable, but the less you think about it the more sense it makes. The movie is also scarier because of the twist. And, as a result, the movie makes sense because of the twist. For a change this is a movie that has a twist that isn't cliched and is neccessary. The ending twist may not be needed, but it, in an odd way, it is needed to make sense of the rest of the film.""The Skeleton Key"" is 1 hour 38 minutes.It is rated PG-13 for Violence (A strangulation, a stabbing, a few shootings, broken legs, lynchings, burnings, and a dismemberment), Disturbing Images (Skin, teeth, animal fetus' are seen in jars, a persons eyes and mouth are shown stitched shut, and we see it happen), Nudity (Brief toplessness), and Language (1 f-word, other profanities).",N/A

906358,"I just got this DVD yesterday afternoon and couldn't wait to get back home to watch it and see the insert. I started with volume I and it played all the tracks from volume II! I figured I had 2 of the same discs but realized the problem had to do with the pressing. Although each discs are labelled, coded and packaged as volume I and II, disc 1 contains the other disc's material and vice-versa. This problem should only affect the Canadian editions and will hopefully be fixed, as people buying only one out of the two volumes might not be particularly happy with their purchase!This comes in a clear Amaray-type case and the booklet has 8 pages, including 4 full pictures. The cover is designed to represent one half of a full picture and, as the result, the artwork for volume I is reversed. The DVD menus are very simple and feature the ONJ heart logo but no Olivia pictures, except for animated previews on the tracks selection pages. The cool thing is that on top of being able to play separate songs and the whole DVD, there's also a playlist feature, giving the option to view them in a different order.If you think all Olivia Newton-John related reviews should be 100% positive, please stop reading here.The digital transfer for this single-layer release is very average, at best, and overly compressed. In most cases, it's better than the ""20th Century Masters"" DVD but very grainy for the live songs, compared to the ""Olivia Live In Concert"" bootleg DVD from Korea. On the plus side, the audio sounds than on the tapes and the Korean bootleg.While the audio presents noticeable limitations due to the fact that it's only available in Dolby Digital 2.0, the worse part is the remastering. Instead of using the original audio tracks, they edited the actual album tracks. ""Landslide"" is the album version, instead of the video mix, and there are no crowd sounds present at the beginning or end of the bar scenes from certain of the ""Physical"" videos.Overall, it's great to finally have a lot (though not all) of Olivia Newton-John's videos on DVD but I feel they could've put more effort into it, quality-wise. Also, the live songs should've been released separately as the original ""Olivia In Concert"", since they're not actual videos and don't quite belong on this collection.

910997,"It wasn't horrible, don't get me wrong. However, if you are going out to see a good romantic-comedy type movie I would suggest something else. Hitch for example. 'Hitch' is everything this movie is not. It is funny, fast paced, with great chemistry between actors, and a good leading male in Will Smith. 'Guess Who' however was incredibly predictable and slow moving at times. While there were a lot of ""funny"" parts in the movie, there was nothing in it that I laughed out loud at. The jokes were forced out for the most part, and the actors looked like they were going through the motions. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the the leading male and female in this. At no point did I feel I was looking at real characters. I just felt I was seeing Bernie Mac playing the role of the father, and Ashton playing the 'boyfriend'. Ashton was silly while trying to be funny, which is his style and personality. But he was unconvincing and awkward while trying to be serious. Ashton is just in over his head with this kind of acting.In short, this is one I would suggest waiting to see on video. If you were thinking of a good evening out, I would suggest Hitch or go with a totally different genre of movie.",N/A
594960,"Is director M. Night Shyamalan returning to his roots? His first film (which only played at the Toronto Film Festival in 1992), Praying With Anger, explored some religious themes. Signs not only explores them, it exhausts them. If you go into the theater expecting a scary, action-packed chiller with freaky aliens and lots of special effects, you might be looking for other signs, the ones that say EXIT. If however, you're willing to settle for a drama about a man who's lost his faith in God and struggles to find it again when faced with a life and death struggle, you just might like Signs. It's not a bad movie, but it's not what it's being marketed as. I have a feeling that at least one of the crop circles was made by the missing reel that would have made this movie pay off its marketing plot.Billed as a thriller, Signs is set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and stars Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, a recently widowed, recently retired preacher, raising two small children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) and supporting his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) on the sprawling family farm. The signs start to occur right away, when crop circles appear in Hess's cornfield. Without much time to decide whether or not the circles are the work of pranksters, the news media announces that aliens have invaded the world and they're not here to use the telephone.Between the buildup (there are some excellent 'fakeout' scares), there are lots of flashbacks designed to show us why Hess lost his faith. His wife was hit by an inattentive director, er, driver (played by Shyamalan) while out on a late night walk on one of the country roads. Mrs. Hess, of course, hangs on just long enough to deliver some prophetic last words to her husband. (The other unforgivable clich&eacute; in the movie is the asthmatic child locked in a small room, separated from his precious medicine, while the bad guys roam the home.)Like Unbreakable, Shyamalan's second major feature, Signs takes a very long time to get to the point. And just when it seems like things are about to get exciting, it's decided that locking everyone in a dark coal cellar, where nobody (including the audience) can see anything, is a good idea. The cinematography (by the usually very capable Tak Fujimoto), is often too dim, flat, and muddied.You could say Signs is an amalgam of The Apostle, The Blair Witch Project, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Panic Room, and The Natural. I've heard some 'crap circles' grumblings from the movie-going ranks, and someone else compared The Sixth Sense director's batting average to the Phoenix character in Signs: he's a failed baseball player who struck out too many times and has found himself in limbo. Shyamalan hit the ball out of the park with The Sixth Sense, but now he's got two strikes with Unbreakable and Signs. One more and is he out? It may seem unfair to compare his three major motion pictures this way, but that's what moviegoers do. They try to make informed decisions on what they've seen before, before parting with their hard-earned dollars.In Signs, there are some excellent moments of suspense. You hear more than you see, and that works beautifully in connection with the understated, eerie score by James Newton Howard. Unfortunately, there are long stretches of downtime and distracting flashbacks between the moments of suspense. It's too bad, because Shyamalan is talented, and I know he is capable of ratcheting up the suspense levels to all-time highs. But in this case, it looks like he fell in love with the idea of ""two kinds of people"" (you have to see the movie to get that) and forgot he was making Signs for the general masses.There are bits and pieces of a good, scary story here, and the cast is definitely above par. Gibson paired with Shyamalan, and the promise of creepy aliens, is bound to bring in some dollar signs at the box office. Whether or not it will have legs depends on whether or not the audiences will accept that the sci-fi element is just a facade for the movie's true wares: a ponderous sermon on spirituality rising above the threat of 'the devil'.",Signs
367383,"Horror movies have become total s@#t lately. Most of them are PG-13 kiddie flicks with no true terror or even minor scares, and they definalty don't have any smarts or even ideas really. Darkness Falls, Soul Survivors, Final Destination 2, The Grudge, Boogeyman, Cursed, this stuff isn't even watchable anymore. Clive Barker must come deliver us from these times of mundane generic horror and refresh us with his brilliant imagination. Movies like Hellraiser raised the bar for horror in its day.

333054,"This should have been the end of the Home Alone series, seeing that the same premise and cast were used for two films but, naturally, Hollywood just can't resist trying to squeeze more money from a proven formula.I'm not one for sequels but this was one of the handful that I can enjoy time and again, not only because the original cast is in it, but because of Macaulay Culkin's comedic ability (even as a kid) and Joe Pesci's and Daniel Stern's reactions to getting their butts kicked, booby trap style.Kevin is not forgotten (like he was last time) but hops the wrong plane after he puts fresh batteries in the family camera right before he gets to the gate at the airport (his family had all the bad luck with high winds knocking out the electric - and the alarm clock - twice).  He mistakes a man with the same coat as his father and after Kevin reassures a flight attendant he's on the right plane, takes his seat ... in a plane heading in the exact opposite direction the rest of his family is going (naturally, no one realizes Kevin's missing until they're in Miami and he's in NY).Who could have thought a vacant New York brownstone could be so much fun?  Sure, Pesci's and Stern's characters are more banged up this time but, hey, they started it.

710709,"In 1971 the psychologist Phil Zimbardo commenced a prison study that was about to change the rules for human behavioral science.  The study consisted of volunteers that were arranged as either prisoners or guards, as the study took place in the basement of Stanford's Psychology Department.  No formal training was given to the guards, as they were told to exercise their judgment in how to enforce the law.  Through five days of imprisonment the ""prisoners"" endured humiliation and degradation and they were forced to abort the study due to having generated a powerfully dangerous situation.  The Experiment is based of this study by Zimbardo; however, in this fictionalized version the audience gets to see how the study continues after five days.Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bleibtreu) drives a taxi for a living and while waiting for a customer he stumbles across an ad for a research prison study.  Fascinated by the ad he applies for a part in the study, as the audience finds out that he also is a highly educated man who used to work as a journalist.  Through Tarek's old connections he gets a freelance job to provide inside information for a new paper while secretively filming the events in the simulated prison.  The study begins harmlessly, as the assigned guards are awkward in their role as prison guards while the prisoner's initially are entertained by the simulated situation.  Nonetheless, after a mere 24-hours the guards begin to exercise their powers and as the hours pass they become more comfortable in their role as guards and begin to enforce the law with callous authority.During the time in the simulated prison Tarek, or prisoner #77, which is his new name, and the other inmates slowly begin to confuse the border between reality and make-believe.  In order for #77 to keep his sanity he often thinks and dreams of Dora (Maren Eggert), a young woman he met through a car accident just before being imprisoned in the illusion of a jail.  The thought of Dora seems to provide #77 a sense of connection with reality, and hope, much like his friend and inmate #82 (Oliver Stokowski) who dreams of a yellow Ferrari.  Yet, the hope and dream of being on the outside for something better quickly gets murkier, as the humiliation increases and the derogatory treatment of the inmates intensifies.  This continues while the scientists discuss the possibility of aborting the experiment, as it is deemed dangerous, but the experiment continues--something many will regret in the aftermath of the experiment.Experiment will induce strong uncomfortable feelings in the audience.  Some will feel a level of disgust to the behavior and this could manifest itself in a feeling as if the intestines were tying themselves in a knot.  There are moments when the audience will want to turn their heads away, yet they cannot as what takes place in front of them is so distastefully hypnotizing as curiosity of what will happen next draws the audience to continue to watch.  This is cleverly created by Oliver Hirschbiegel who generates a similar curiosity that the scientists must be experiencing.  This notion also triggers a certain level of guilt within the audience for participating in the viewing of the film, as it makes the audience a silent participate in a manner similar to one of the prison guards.The cast performs exceptionally, as the audience will begin to feel revulsion and maybe even hatred toward some of the guards.  However, can one blame the guards in the film, as the experiment encourages this absolute repulsive behavior when the guards begin to live their roles as guards?  Ultimately, the audience will feel disgust for what took place, yet the film leaves the audience in a contemplative mind-set of similar actions taking place where those who protect the law are not overseen.  For example, in prisons around the world, and the recent prison scandal in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and elsewhere where similar incidents might not have been reported.  Another question that the film raises is whether convicts that experiences similar treatment will be rehabilitated to reenter the society after their release.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel who recently made Downfall (2004) about Hitler's last day in the Berlin bunker brings this truly repulsive, yet important film to the audience.  The camera work, lighting, mise-en-scene, and script provide additional strength to the story, as the cast's performance ties it together in front of the camera with several strong performances.  Together these cinematic elements help create an experience that should be contemplated, as they provide an abhorrent event at a safe distance where the audience can learn the valuable lesson that the film provides.  Long after the screen has turned black and time has past since the viewing of Experiment, the audience will remember this film, which makes this film even more powerful.",N/A

Rich shipyard owner, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), presses the retiree to undertake a detective job following his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who Gavin believes may be under some kind of supernatural possession and who seems to be a reincarnated version of her grandmother. Following a near death drowning Scotty becomes embroiled in an affair with Mrs. Elster, using several attempts at psychoanalysis to try and find what is at the root of her mysterious illness.Hitchcock's hypnotic tale of suspense and intrigue builds itself around the premise of obsession and compulsive disorders. The director even conjured up a pre-sixties trippy montage sequence. Vertigo is shot rich in color with lots of moving lighting effects even simulating cloud clover over the sun. The choice of filming at a number of popular American landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge gives Vertigo its grandeur along with geographical attraction.The deconstruction of Scotty who goes mad towards the end of the film has a sense of urgency about it as he quickly becomes the `control freak' of all movies. It is an interesting note to see shop models wearing the clothes that people want to buy. The last scene invokes a sense of history repeating itself for those who try to free themselves of the past.

The auditioners thought that his appearance and accent were acceptable but then, well, they just didn't know....  so they asked Andy to wait in the office while a few other applicants were evaluated.  In the office a secretary asked Andy what he did so in explaination he went into one of his night club monologues for her.  Passers by heard the goings on and stopped their activities to watch also.

Comics of the 50's that went on to inspire the show on disc two.The episode's of season one:""The Man Who Was Death"" - William Sadler (""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey"" & ""Die Hard 2"") stars as an electrician who works at the state pen pulling the switch for the electric chair on death row. When the state decide's to ax the death penalty law, Sadler loses his job & dispenses his own type of lightning fast justice with electrifying results. O.K. first episode that sets the stage for the basic premise of the series.""And All Through The House..."" - An adulterous wife murders her idiot husband on Christmas Eve. But, a homicidal Santa Claws pays a visit with some last minute Xmas chopping to do. Hands down the best episode of the season. It's my personal favorite & arguably the best episode of the entire series. This is the episode that got viewers hooked, and the, now classic, ending feels like its right out of the comic book. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Back To The Future"", ""Forrest Gump"") with Larry Drake (""Dark Night Of The Scarecrow"", ""L.A. Law"") as Santa.""Dig That Cat He's Real Gone"" - Directed by ""Lethal Weapon"" & ""Superman"" auteur Richard Donnor. Joe Pantialano (""Risky Business"", ""The Goonies"" & ""The Sopranos"") is a homeless stumblebum who, after being bribed with a couple of bucks, goes through a bizarre scientific experiment in which the gland of a cat is surgically put into his head. This gland contains the cat's nine lives, & with the operation a success the stumblebum decides to make money off his other lives. But, with money comes fame and all the trappings with it including irresponsibility. In the end the bum is one dumb p***y. Another O.K. episode that has a few decent laughs, with a cameo by Donnor.""Only Sin Deep"" - Lea Thompson (""Back To The Future"", ""Howard The Duck"") stars as a prostitute who sells her beauty for money & romance. But, everything comes with a price & she must learn that beauty is only skin deep, the hard way. Lame episode that has no scares or thrills.""Lover Come Hack To Me"" - A newlywed couple's honeymoon goes awry when a savage thunderstorm gets them lost in the middle of nowhere, making them spend the night in a deserted house. Or are they really lost? The husband plans to off the wife and take her money, but, the wife has other plans in store for her beloved. And how about that mother-in-law... what a real battle ax! Decent episode that's quite gruesome at the end.""Collection Completed"" - M. Emmet Walsh (""Fletch"") stars as a  hardware sales rep. freshly retired & ready to spend his golden years in the house that he payed for with his wife. But, with his goofy wife and her legions of pets roaming around the house, its enought to make a man pick up a new hobby -taxedermy! Another decent episode with a shocking conclusion.The downside of ""Tales"":The problem with this set is that this should have been part of a much larger box set with season two.The episodes aren't remastered and there is some noticable grain throughout the series (these were released on video in 1990 after there intial first run on HBO). What's worse is in 1999 HBO Video released a compilation of Robert Zemeckis' ""Crypt"" episodes on DVD & those looked better than the the episodes presented here.2.0 Dolby (what the f**k?!)The opening main titles aren't even shown. Only the closing credits are shown after each episode. This is retarded. Instead, we are treated to a severly cropped & grainy version of the opening credits at the very beginning of the DVD presentation with a skip intro option at the bottom righthand screen. Very gay & hopefully won't be on season two.The upside of ""Tales"":The packaging is pretty cool & looks like the same way, format wise, as the comic book looked back in the day.The documentary is awesome revealing the history of the comic book. ""Tales From The Crypt"" was the second best selling comic book in the fifties, right behind DC Comics' ""Superman"".Before the series debuted on HBO in 1989, in the early seventies there was a low budget ""Crypt"" movie made starring Joan Collins.""And All Through The House..."" A great episode that, with the documentary, is what makes getting this set all the more worthwhile.With season two due out on October 25th, ""Tales From The Crypt"" is both trick, as well as, treat.",Tales from the Crypt: Season 1
201184,"When you first see George and Doris, they're decked out in 1950s clothes.  In fact Doris is wearing some ""New Look"" outfits that show it must be during the 1950s.  Some years later we see the faces of Ike and Adlai Stevenson, showing the 1950s and the rise of Elvis Presley, and Doris picks a quarrel with George.  (At least that is my interpretation.)  How did they get the two stars to look so young?  If you ask me, the makeup people should have won the Oscar, not the stars!  Just kidding because actually, the stars are excellent and Ellen Burstyn easily out does her part in ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANY MORE.  Watching the movie on DVD you can appreciate her more, in fact living through the movie is rather like leafing through one of those books about THE FILMS OF ELLEN BURSTYN, for many of her ""looks"" from her previous movies are referenced-from time to time you will see the young, innocent Burstyn of her TV days when she was still billed as ""Ellen McRae,"" and then you will experience the sensual, assured Ellen Burstyn of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.  Fast forward a bit to Burstyn as Chris in ""The Exorcist,"" and then to her wonderful part in the Jules Dassin film with Melina Mercouri, ""A Dream of Passion.""  In the very last part of the film, set in 1977, Burstyn is skillfully aged so that she seems almost to be an old woman, forecasting the way she would come to look in, say, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.Next to her you realize that Alan Alda's appearance doesn't change that much (though he has many comic moments in the hippie era) but he's providing admirable support to Burstyn and he never lets her down.  Wonder why neither of them truly made it as superstars.  What they lack in looks (and both are very good looking, just not ""perfect"" in the way of Hollywood) they both have in talent.  The script of STNY is serviceable, and the California locations in Mendocino are superb.  When I first saw the movie, I decided that if you have to cheat, Heritage House is the place to do it in.

If huge screens and stereophonic sound couldn't put those asses into the seats, then maybe actual rip offs of already aired TV programs might.  (We see this same thinking today with studio remakes of such old TV series as BEWITCHED, SWAT, THE MOD SQUAD, DUKES OF HAZZARD, really anything that is remembered fondly).  Here they sent in TV director par excellence Sidney Lumet, with a limited budget, to film Reginald Rose's controversial teleplay he called ""TWELVE ANGRY MEN.""  They gave him one bona fide movie star and for the rest of the parts they hired a bunch of so called ""character actors"" including Broadway's own Lee J. Cobb, a man tormented by the role he had played in the McCarthy Era, when to save his own skin he had named name after name to anti-Communist inquisitors and ruined countless careers.  When he sweats in this movie you can see the guilt streaming from his pores, it's almost as though you can touch your finger to the screen and it woild be wet.The movie wasn't an overwhelming box office hit, but it had its partisans, and it launched Lumet's career as a reliable film director who could bring projects in on time AND work well with ""difficult"" talent.  When we watch the show today we see the faults in the play's mise-en-scene, but we note the skill with which Lumet puts the cast through their paces and manages to bring some variety in his endless re-stagings of conversations between angelic Fonda and the all-too-human rest of them.As other reviewers have noticed, if it was today, one of the jurors would have early on beaten Fonda to a pulp and had a mistrial called.

But for her role in the 2003 film, Monster, no one had expected see this beautiful girl take on a role so horrifying. That role is the real life role of serial killer & prostitute, Aileen Wuornos.Aileen Wuornos (played the beautiful Charlize Theron) has grown up living the worst life you could even possible think of. She was raped and beaten. You would think she would have at least one day to be happy during her adolescent years. But Aileen had one day killed the man who she was living with the time for raping her and beating her.No grown up and living Florida, Aileen has no professional job. Instead, she earns living as a prostitute. Living with her is Selby (played by Christina Ricci), who has made abundantly clear that is a full-blown out Lesbian. Together, Aileen and Selby have developed a friendship, which goes into a sort of love affair. Because of her rotten teen years, Aileen is all screwed up. I mean, she is experiment with lesbianism, she is prostituting all over Florida. Now, she lures men into thinking she'll give them a quick bang in the backseat of their cars. Apparently, the men do get a quick bang in the backseat, but the bang is not even close to sex; the quick bang is a gunshot, coming from the gun owned by Aileen. Seven murders later, Aileen is arrested and taken to court, after she allows Selby to go free, since she has nothing to do with the murders. Aileen was locked up, sentenced for life, where she and Selby never spoke again. On October 29th, 2002, Aileen was executed after a 12-year trial.For this role, Charlize Theron's beauty had vanished into the hideous face of Aileen Wuornos. Because of her outstanding portrayal as the psychotic woman, Charlize had received the Oscar for Best Actress. And I tell you something, this woman more than deserved the award. Aileen may have been a complete wacko, meaning she lied about the whole ordeal she went through, while growing up, Charlize had portrayed this character so brilliantly that there was no choice, but to allow Charlize to be the only actress to win this Oscar award.

288583,"""Smile"" is a gentle satire of the beauty pageant scene as well as more generally the 1970s California lifestyle.  Released in 1975, the film was not a hit but has gathered a bit of a cult following.  Barbara Feldon and Bruce Dern star as the organizers of the California Young American Miss contest.  The story follows the behind-the-scenes shenanigans leading up to the final pageant.  Sprained ankles, exploding batons, and dead chickens are just part of the fun!The script by Jay Belson (""Fun with Dick and Jane"") is great fun -- ranging from subtle poking of its targets to broad farce.  A number of targets are skewered facilely aside from beauty contests, particularly the superificial California lifestyle where making money and looking good is paramount.  It's a clever movie, although not every scene is designed to be laugh-out-loud funny.Director Michael Ritchie definitely peaked with this film, as he would later direct such bombs as ""The Island"" and ""The Golden Child.""  Although ""Smile"" is a somewhat obscure movie, the genial humor of the film makes it most worthy of greater attention.  In particular, people who have enjoyed the satirical movies of Christopher Guest (""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best In Show"") are likely to appreciate ""Smile.""  Overall, a solid 1970s film that will make you laugh and smile.DVD Extras: Consist only of an original trailer.  Fortunately, the DVD transfer and sound are quite good.",N/A

The plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not live up to Porter's quality.The best examples I can give is the fact that there is no Evangelist so the title song ""Anything Goes"" turns into a second act number, sung by Mitzi and chorus (with horrific word changes) and ""Blow Gabriel Blow"" becomes a finale in the broadway show (sung by the four main characters) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line.If you haven't seen it on stage it's pleasant enough, but if you're expecting the broadway show it's a major disappointment.",N/A

The thirty-million dollar budgeted The Passion of the Christ, which then went on to gross more then three-hundred and seventy-million dollars in North America alone by the end of its run in theatres, played brilliantly off of Michael Moore's seething anti-Bush propagandist piece Fahrenheit 9/11 and by November of that year proved to be momentous in the president's reelection victory, although it was far from the true issue which garnered him the majority of the people's vote (that being his stance toward the war against terrorism). The release of the second of six books in the Chronicles of Narnia series comes at a time when American Christians, many of whom side with in some shape or another with the Republican Party, find themselves in pitched battle against the intimations of political correctness and multiculturalism in their retention of the significance and sanctity of Christmas itself. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe will likely play a less indicative role then The Passion of the Christ did toward the political environment of the country last year and yet its direct allusions to Christ and his message will almost certainly be a factor in the way Christians are motivated maintain their traditions and be less reluctant to give them up for anyone.The story for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe remains true to both C.S. Lewis's epic vision of the whimsical world of Narnia and all those who inhabit it and the Christian undertones which encompass the plot and character developments of the entire book series. This said however, the feature film adaptation of the classic children's novel does take its fair share of creative liberties in regards to specific plot elements which, for lack of a better word, fail to translate as effectively onto the screen as Lewis may have hoped they would. Rather then tarnishing C.S. Lewis's epic, they instead enhance the emotional intensity of the plot. For example, there is a scene not presented in the book in which the White Witch's secret police (wolves) are in hot pursuit of Peter, Susan, and Lucy as they cross the thawing river. This accentuates the potency of the situation and makes for a far more engaging experience then any minimal description penned in the novel could have. Furthermore, scenes like the opening sequence of the film in which German (Nazi) planes are seen bombing the city of London, an event now referred to as The Battle of Britain, fills in the gaps of background information left absent by Lewis. And while Adamson falls short of addressing the specifics of either the Nazis who bombed Britain or the Second World War in general, he leaves just enough room to allow parents at their own discretion to discuss these events in more detail with their own children as they see fit.All four child actors in the roles of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie do a splendid job in their respected roles. There are however some issues with their characters. Peter's transformation from a gangling British preteen into a cunning and formidable warrior and inspirational leader of Aslan's army is one point of contention. It comes off as a bit miraculous, if not a bit implausible, and may be difficult for some people to swallow. Nevertheless, this is a fantasy film after all and it can just as easily be contributed to magic.James McAvoy is positively magnificent in the role of Mr. Tumnus, the faun, or half-man/half-goat, who is the first creature in the world of Narnia to befriend the young Lucy when she initially enters the magical wardrobe. His interaction with Lucy, played adorably by newcomer Georgie Henley, is emotionally priceless and works every bit as well as one might have imagined reading the children's novel. The character himself is representative of two crucial concepts author C.S. Lewis introduces in the novel. While the faun is a creature often associated with Greek/Roman paganism, he is not necessarily an evil character. Although he does stray from the righteous path in the beginning, he quickly comes to see the error of his ways and repents. Lewis' point here is that while Christianity is preferred above all other religions, every religion strives toward the virtues of charity and compassion. So when you boil down to the basics of religion, there is a common element that every one of us can relate to. The second point Lewis makes with the introduction of Mr. Tumnus is that while Christians are susceptible to sin and may initially fall prey to it, whether it be out of fear or necessity, we still have the choice to realize we are in the wrong and make up for our mistakes as Mr. Tumnus does.Tilda Swinton is emphatically conniving as the white witch Jadis, an evil enchantress who rules the realm of Narnia with a cold iron fist, turning anyone who crosses her path into stone and stowing away the hope of all its inhabitants with continuous winter without Christmas. Jadis signifies the figurative temptation of sin and evil in the world. While on the outside she may emit a certain ambiance about her that makes her attractive and desirable, once Edward gives in to the white witch's desire to capture Peter, Susan, and Lucy, he comes to grips with her true nature which is malevolent to the core. And while some readers are quick to associate Jadis with Satan, supreme rule of Hell, most literary scholars agree that she may very well be a servant of Lucifer but not the actual Prince of Darkness himself since there is no direct correlation between her actions and those of Satan as opposed to the equivalence between Aslan and Jesus Christ. Her demise, however, is not as dramatic as it should have been and feels a bit rushed as soon as the resurrected Aslan arrives on the battle scene.Overall, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is every bit as magnificent as readers dreamed it would be and exceeds nearly every expectation, though certainly far from all of them, writer C.S. Lewis may have set down for its adaptation in the last fifty years since audiences first discovered the world of Narnia. Parents however should seek to take certain precautions with their younger children as there particular scenes in the film, specifically the sacrifice of Aslan on the Stone Table, which are emotionally profound and may be too stimulating for smaller audiences. Nevertheless, if children of a specific age demographic are able to sit through the latest Harry Potter picture with little if any difficulties at all then they should be fine toward this film. The musical score, conducted by Academy Award-winning composer Harry Gregson-Williams, famous for compositions for Shrek and Team America: World Police, is not nearly as memorable as those for The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter franchises, lacking anything related to a reoccurring musical theme, but at the same time it reaches the right emotional depth, particularly in the Battle for Narnia, while not overshadowing the actions or dialogue onscreen. Director Andrew Adamson and, more importantly, the new leadership of the Walt Disney Corporation who have in the past been far from what one would consider a close friend to the Christian community should be commended for not downplaying the allusions to Christian theology, particularly Aslan as a mirror-image of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, in an age where political correctness has dominated modern society. There is still much debate amongst the literary community as to whether the Christian allegories in The Chronicles of Narnia series were intentional or not on the part of adult Christian convert C.S. Lewis. Regardless of the true answer, if one does indeed exist, anyone unfamiliar with the suggested theological prospects of the story will hardly notice and their perception of the film so go unchanged. Though comparisons are likely to made to The Lord of the Rings series or even the Harry Potter franchise, nonetheless the special effects of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe hold their own as dazzling and the physical environment which encompasses the characters of the film, all shot on the island of New Zealand where Peter Jackson's King Kong and the three Lord of the Rings films were also filmed, is nothing short of breathtaking. Notwithstanding allegations from the ACLU quick to label The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a piece of unmitigated brainwashing propaganda from the religious right who seek to convert the `pagans' to Christianity, the film remains a timeless fantasy classic and an emotionally grappling motion picture event, theological allusions or not.",N/A

There is close observation of details in how we talk to each other, much of which is very funny.  Catherine Keener once again shows how excellent an actor she is, inhabiting her character so completely and naturally she saves the movie.  Her examples of ""fake"" and real smiles are terrific to watch, as is her panic being at a party where she is a nobody.  In a way this movie is part insider ""Hollywood "" joke and part essay on female insecurities.The director has inserted a subplot about an adopted sister that is good by itself but not really needed as part of the flow and it detracts from the overall effect.Rent it for Keener, otherwise as an example of a project that did not quite make it..

898119,"Filmed in 1994, this Live At Montreux series DVD gives the viewer a taste of three virtuosos performing material for the first time together as a trio. How would they fare, given the unique dynamics and peculiarities of each performer, in an unrehearsed live session?During the solo performances of Al DiMeola in the the first track, ""Song To John,""the camera closed in on his hands as if to suggest, ""See, this is how easy it is."" As if! In an extended solo duel between with Stanely Clarke, each leaned in towards the other, exchanging intense but friendly eye contact. Ponty and DiMeola constantly populated the music with bright, rich and silken notes. Ponty's notes seem almost to sing out on their own, the higher in pitch they climbed. Clarke, head bopping, eyes squinting as if they were squeezing out notes. He plucked his bass frantically, appearing almost as if he was in a trance-like state. This was all in the first track, in which applause erupted as it quieted to a close.Ponty's solo began with him tapping the strings on his violin with his bow and having it quietly played back over and over again, thanks to the electronics employed. While not revolutionary, it added dimension to his performance and made you wonder, ""Is he really playing all that music by himself?"" Born in 1942 in Avranches, France, Ponty, came from a family of classical musicians. He began his career as a classical player, often playing jazz late at night in the clubs. The violin initially was a tough sell as a jazz instrument, but eventually, he won them over and released his debut solo album at the age of 22. He released 12 consective albums that reached the top 5 in the Billboard jazz charts in the 70s and established himself as a prime touring artist.In one one of his quieter solos, DiMeola coaxed out the familiar wailing guitar notes for ""Layla."" DiMeola sat in the middle, and occaisionally, Clarke and Ponty, both standing would lock eyes and play off of each other.One of the strongest examples of the group gelling together really well is in the DiMeola-written ""Chilean Pipe Song."" Everything Ponty plays seems to fit as if it was written specifically with him in mind. It's also very catchy.In a light moment, after DiMeola introduced Clarke and Ponty, he proceeded to turn his sheet music over and over and upside down, not sure where to begin playing the new song.In the fusion world, Stanley Clarke (1951)was the first bassist to headline sold out tours and have his albums reach Gold status. He essentially made it just fine to be a bass player, band leader and seller of lots of records and preceded the late, great Jaco Pastorius as the first prominent fusion bass player. Clarke was part of the seminal fusion group, Return To Forever, along with Chick Corea, Al DiMeola and various drummers. He's also an accomplished composer of film soundstracks, such as Boys N the Hood, Passenger 57, Higher Learning, and Poetic Justice. His solo performance piece was his famous ""School Days"" from his 1976 album of the same name. He is the pre-eminent fusion bass player of our time.Born in 1954, Al DiMeola was lauded early on for his speed, technical skills, and complicated soloing. He became known for his Latin, flamenco and tango-influenced playing. He joined Return To Forever as the replacement for Bill Connors and helped them to achieve great commercial success. The 1976 album Romantic Warrior was a top 40 album. He went solo in 1976 and released a string of landmark fusion albums, such as Land of the Midnight Sun and Elegant Gypsy. Towards the early part of the 90s, he began to focus more on world-music influenced recordings, such as World Sinfonia Trio and Heart of the Immigrants.Keyboardist Monty Alexander tickled the ivories for the encore of ""Song To John."" While he's a fine player, I can honestly say that I have never enjoyed the sound of the electronic piano. It just doesn't as good as a real acoustic piano. Still, Alexander's prescence adds to this number in a positive way. I almost wish the Jamaican-born pianist had been there from the begining.It's to be expected that you can throw a group of experienced jazz musicians together and have them play as if they had been rehearsing and playing together as a group for years.Fusion jazz very much flows freely, without the usual tension and counterbalance heard in straight ahead jazz. In many places, the players seem to wander off on their own, creating the lack of a common theme to bind the music together. For this reason, people who generally don't like fusion may find this recording tedious and may not be won over by it. On the other hand, some will appreciate the subtle spontanaiety and the result of putting three players, all dominant on their respective instrument, together to see what transpires.Far from being a clinical or lifeless concert, the often flawless musicianship left me wanting more and wishing that I was there. Having seen Al DiMeola perform live with his acoustic guitar, in support of the Heart of the Immigrants album from 1993, I can tell you how downright thrilling it was to see him. He's one of the few musicians, as a friend noted, who's better live than he is on album.In 1995, the trio recorded the Rites of String album, which peaked at #4 on the US jazz charts.Set list01.

DMX gets a serious role, and just exceeded my exectations.Also nice performances by Michael Ealy as a man filled with nothing but revenge and sorrow, David Arquet, the man who uncoverd David's past via his documentery, and Cliftion Powel, the man King David owes.This movie is dark, gritty, and a movie that shouldn't be slept on, especially by fans of X.

I loved seeing this film partly because I was never able to attend the stage performance so it was great to see it in action.I loved this film because it struck my chords of emotion, empathy, and anticipation not just irritating song after smiling song. I hate musicals and this is NOT a mere musical, it is a work of art. The colors, the actors, the sets, the story. Nothing was overdone. Gerard Butler was great as the phantom letting the audience see the sinister and the sympathetic without giving too much.However his voice, while speaking is rich, but I can't say I cared for his singing much except the DON JUAN performance. As an experienced musician with a good ear, I say Emmy Rossum was great I don't know why people are dogging her so! And last but not least, Minnie Driver did an excellent job as the Diva Carlotta, she was just out of control.Okay I don't have any other words to describe how much I enjoyed this film ( I cried at the end and I usually don't cry over movies).

873333,"As someone who is admittedly addicted to horror films, I'd like to think I've seen it all. But every now and then, a movie comes along, takes me by surprise, and knees me in the groin. ""Saw"" is that film. From beginning to end, this movie is pure intensity. Directed by the young James Wan, who is just getting started in the business (and got one helluva headstart with this movie), ""Saw"" revolves around two seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) who wake up opposite of each other in a dirty, stinky, sketchy old bathroom, chained to the pipes and with a dead body loafing in between them. It seems that someone is playing a game with them, someone who selects the players in his game for a reason. He doesn't actually kill these people himself, but somehow, they end up dead (sound familiar, Kevin Spacey fans?). Hot on his trail, in a simultaneous subplot is Detective David Tapp (played by Danny Glover), who has a has a vendetta against one of the men trapped in the room. The movie moves at a brisk pace. It is absolutely unrelentless and virtually humorless. There isn't a moment where the movie sags, or where you, the viewer, can relax. Everytime you think you've wrapped your head around this movie, a curveball is thrown at you, straight up until the knock-out ending. I really can't explain much more about the plot without ruining parts of the movie. No doubt, this movie bares similarities with ""Se7en,"" both in the story (which was also penned by Whannell) and in Wan's directing style. However, instead of coming off as derivitive, Wan uses his obvious influences to paint a totally different picture. He uses some stark, nightmarish images to full effect (check out the child abduction scene...how creepy) and turns old cliches (Adam's apartment scene) on their heels. The story, and more importantly, the characters are what's important here. Whannell created two very different, flawed, but sympathetic leads that we really start to care for, despite whatever events unfold (I saw a little of myself in Adam). Overall, I can't find a flaw in this film. It is just mind-blowing. It is perfectly crafted. Every little shot in this movie is in there for a reason, so pay attention. ""Saw"" is more than just your average thriller, and it doesn't reduce to splatterfest either (although there are some grisly scenes). Easily the best horror flick to come out last year. Fans of the genre should not miss it. The DVD is a little disappointing, with the mere highlight being the insightful commentary from Wan and Whannell. Also included is a feature, albeit brief, on the making of the movie, along with two versions of Fear Factory's ""Bite The Hand That Bleeds"" video and a making of the video segment. Pretty skimpy for a landmark release like this. I smell a re-release on the horizon (?).",N/A
849623,"MASH proved better than any show that cast changes can be done right. And this was the second season with Winchester, who finally fit into the overall picture better. He was not a spitful comic foil as Burns had been. But he was a more well rounded character.So were all the characters. After 7 years, it was impossible for this show to continue to be the vaudville style comedy it had been in season one and two. It was the death of Henry at the end of season three that paved the way for a more serious show. Or at least more believable characters, who evolved as their situation changed.Season 7 has some great funny episodes and some more serious ones. And it is that balancing act that kept MASH at the forefront of all time great TV shows.In later seasons, the writing gets a little bit harder to enjoy, as does some of the extras on the show, who really couldn't act very well. But after over 200 episodes, it was hard to figure out how to keep the ball in the air without retreading old storylines.Seasons 7 and 8 were among the last of the ""fresh"" feeling seasons, before things started to seem a little tired.

884413,"Patrick Marber, the author of the play by the same name wrote the screenplay for Mike Nichols' screen adaption so I assume he's happy with this production. First, Mike Nichols continues to give us one fine movie after another-- from his first THE GRADUATE to his most recent ANGELS IN AMERICA. This film is no exception and is wonderfully filmed-- there are lots of closeups of the characters that we expect from Nichols and certainly appropriate here since the movie essentially is about four individuals who do an awful lot of talking-- when they aren't changing partners and bedrooms. The acting is superb: Julia Roberts as Anna, Jude Law as Dan, Nathalie Portman as Alice and Clive Owen as Larry give tremendous performances. These are beautiful people who are selfish and nasty to everyone they should care about most, i.e., their spouses and/or lovers.A friend of mine used to say that he didn't care for either fiction or movies if he couldn't like any of the characters. Using that criterion, this movie falls on its face. On the other hand, if you want to see people acting very badly and completely self-centered, then you'll find this movie to your liking.Alice says it all in a scene near the end of the movie when she finally kicks Dan out of her life, saying something to the effect that he didn't have to be cruel to her by being unfaithful and sleeping with Anna, that all of us should realize that there's a line we shouldn't cross in order to prevent hurting someone we love. With the possible exception of Anna, these people will do whatever it takes to get what they think they want and have no interest in staying within boundries.A dark, well acted, well directed movie.",N/A

My son and I are color fanatics, so it had our attention right from the start.Sleeping Beauty is visually arresting. Aurora is one of the most lovely creations of our time and Mary Costa's beautiful voice is perfectly suited to the artwork. The green of Maleficent's cruel visage practically leaps off the screen.

The three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are delightful, especially Merryweather and her petulant intonations (you may recognize her as the well-bred Lady of ""Lady and the Tramp""). The reworking of Tchaikovsky's classic melodies lends a lovely, lilting tone to the settings and characters.The digital transfer and restoration is wonderful and I like that you have the option of viewing the film in either wide- or fullscreen format. I invariably select the widescreen, but I do understand that others do not care for the black bars. The features on the second disk are pleasant and informative for the entire family. There are plenty of fun activities for the children such as the ""Princess Personality Profile"", the ""Sleeping Beauty Ink & Paint Game"", and the ""Rescue Aurora Adventure Game"".

939995,"I have mixed feelings about this performance. Filmed for British TV in 1979, ten years after Dusty's last chart hit, there is an air of ""lounge act"" to this show, with its medley of hits and her covers of trendy disco tunes that she felt obliged to include here (it would have been better had she sung Pattie Brooks' great ""After Dark"", where Brooks sounds uncannily like Dusty.) Dusty recorded some interesting things around this time period, and she could have done justice to a few of her recent recordings, but she chose not to, and instead did a couple of ballads which are effective, but a bit sad (especially one where she sings about not being the latest rage). For a show that apparently was a big deal, with the Queen in attendance, Dusty giggles through a few tunes, including ""The Look of Love"", spoiling the mood. Despite all this, it's interesting to see how the audience clearly loves her. It's too bad there are no shows available from her 1960s TV show. I have a bootleg copy of one of them, and although the quality isn't great, the performances are, with Dusty in her prime, complete with the high hairdos and black makeup, singing incredibly, gesturing enthusiastically, and even playing guitar (on the lovely ""Wayfaring Stranger""). It wasn't until the Pet Shop Boys brought her back into the spotlight with ""What Have I Done to Deserve This"" in 1987 that we got to see & hear Dusty in top form again, which led to several more hits (""Nothing Has Been Proved"", ""In Private"" and ""Reputation"").

325758,"The setting is England, 1940.  A young, newly-commissioned officer arrives at his headquarters.  Whatever he may be expecting, it is not to find out that his first appointment is heading up a bomb disposal unit.  It is an assignment in which the life expectancy is ten weeks, and the disposal men die at a rate of one per day.  When Lieutenant Brian Ash (played superbly by Anthony Andrews (Brideshead Revisited)) realizes that there has been no mistake and that, with no previous knowledge, training or understanding of bombs or bomb defusal, he is to take charge of one of the units, the look on his face is worth a thousand words.  I for one certainly felt a shiver go down my spine.  You see, as the officer in charge, it will be Ash's duty to physically disable the bombs.  The rest of the unit--the sappers, as they're called--are there to do the digging and wood-framing around the bombs so that the officer in charge can access them and so that they can be lifted out and carted away for detonation once they're disarmed.Produced and written (for the most part) by John Hawkesworth, who is most famous for having brought us both Upstairs Downstairs and The Duchess of Duke Street, Danger UXB is a 1979 production and is an absolutely superb period drama--every bit as good as his two better-known offerings and sure to be enjoyed by those who've enjoyed either of those series.  This series, which consists of thirteen 50-minute episodes, revolves around Ash and his unit as they fight the neverending battle of getting rid of unexploded bombs.  The Germans actually used to drop bombs that were designed to remain intact upon impact, often until such time as they were tampered with or until a certain amount of time had passed.  The British were initially unprepared for such a tactic, and with no instruction manuals, they had little choice but to learn about the types of bombs and how best to defuse them through observation and experimentation and with the aid of a lot of luck.  To make matters worse, the Germans kept redesigning the bombs in order to thwart the efforts of the defusers.  As a point of interest, over 20,000 UXBs were moved by disposal units during the war.DVD extras:  A 45-minute ""History Channel"" documentary (an American production) about modern-day bomb disposal units which includes interviews with the men who do the job wherein they share their experiences and reasons for choosing such a high-risk occupation.  One nice thing about this DVD set is that the four discs come in extra-skinny cases (half as thick as the usual cases), which makes it much more compact for storage!In conclusion, this is an intelligently written, superbly acted British suspense-drama (indeed, the suspense is almost unbearable at times!), and the information about the types of bombs and how they work is accurate and informative--so informative that when the series was broadcast in England, a viewer apparently realized that one of his child's toys was in fact a butterfly bomb!  This is a series which will of course be of immense interest to fans of the war genre, but the appeal is broad enough that I would highly recommend it to fans of period productions in general or to anyone looking for a good suspense drama.  Personally, I debated getting it, as I don't really care for war shows, but I'm glad I took a chance on it, as it's as much about relationships and individuals as it is about the dramatic and suspenseful war-time jobs the men do.  With a little of something for everyone, this was a show that both the men and the women in our family thoroughly enjoyed.Extremely highly recommended!",N/A
94712,"What where they thinking giving the script for this movie the green light? Obviously Warner bros. Where just cashing in on the franchise and decided that casting the movie with big names will make it sell, but don't worry about finding a script for it.Val Kilmar replaces Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/ Batman. And he obviously never bothered to watch how Keaton portrayed Batman because he went in a completely wrong direction and made the Bruce Wayne character stiff and almost lifeless at times. The main character of Gotham City is the main focus of the Batman franchise, why cast such a boring actor to drain the life out of character?Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as the Riddler you would think would make a great combination, Tommy as a great actor and Jim bringing the humour to the film, however both of them turned out the worst performance of there acting career's if you ask me. Tommy Lee Jones may have acted like a character he had never been seen to do before, but that doesn't make it good. And Carey did not bring what he should have either, and his acting was horrible too.Nicole Kidman playing the physiatrist to Batman also turned over a new low and created her worst performance too. Her character had no thought and no life behind it, just a familiar face to see on screen.The only actor in this whole film apart from the guy who returned to play Alfred is Chris O'Donnell. But even O'Donnell's excellent portrayal of Robin couldn't save this movie. At least he got to reprise his role in the next Bat-movie and be in a movie much better then this garbage.Please, forget about the cast, I know this movie has a lot of well-known actors, but please, forget that for one moment and take a look at the acting. Take a look at the plot, I was more interested to watch how bad the CGI was in backgrounds then I was in trying to find a good thing to say about this god-awful film. This film was sold on the cast alone. The Big name stars where all that was needed to sell this movie and to cash in on the franchise, and I wish that was a crime, because all it does is produces bad movies and major Hollywood rip-off's that make way for similar cheap scams and ideas by these companies to see what they have got to cash in on.The overall movie's plot could have been interesting with a few tweaks here and there, but instead it has become one of my personal ""worst movie of all time"" contender choices. The movie also murders the realism the first 2 movies had, as far fetched as some things where, at least you could believe it was somewhat in the same reality as the one we live in. Where as this movie and in the 4th one Gotham City has gone from a realistic city to the worlds oldest, most historic and gigantic city in the entire world where all crime bosses and villains seem to be lured to or they are created there.

212906,"This movie is one of a handful of Stephen King stories which translates well on the screen thanks mainly to a wonderful performace by Christopher Walken who is one of my favourite actors. Mr. Walken plays Johnny Smith , a teacher who has a bad car accident while driving home after a date with his girlfriend. Johhny then spends the next 5 years in a coma and awakes to fimnd a new world and his girlfriend hs moved on with her life and has marrid somebody else. However Johnny now finds himself Blessed (or Cursed depending on how you look at it) with the gift of Premonition.Johnny soon becomes a celebrity but all he wants to do is be left alone and pick up the pieces of his lost life.This movis does not contain the standrad Stephen King Horor but is wonderful to watch as Johnnny tries to rebuild his life.

750438,"I wasn't much impressed with the first ""Saw"" but now I realize the first one was a masterpiece comparing to the sequel. The second ""Saw"" is not boring or dumb - it's rather interesting to watch and to follow the story-line. It's interesting to expect the upcoming plot-twist and identification of a killer. But from this kind of a film you always expect something more than just being an ordinary thriller. Unfortunately here you don't get anything except a certain number of used cliches. In the end I got so many questions I didn't know whom to ask. I'm not going to ask now not to spoil the movie for you, I'll just say there are so many flaws in the film... Its creators didn't even try to cover them up. OK, every film has some, and I usually tend not to notice them, but here it was just outrageous.There are successful movies with just a couple of main characters (like ""Saw"", ""Cube"" or ""Blair Witch Project""). When sequel is being made filmmakers stick much more characters into it because they just don't know what to do with this amount of film time. They don't have a talent (like makers of the original) to make a picture with two main characters so it could be intense and gripping and thrilling. It's easier to kill another character every 10 minutes than to keep a viewer breathless for hour and a half, concentrating on just two persons.In ""Saw 2"" when I saw this bunch of people obviously going to get murdered, I understood right away - this won't be a talented thriller.Yes, it has its tense moments, thrill and gore, but as I said, from this kind of film you expect a lot more.A definite potboiler.",Saw II

There are actually about 30 minutes of fun items that await you if you can find them!  Unfortunately, they can't be found by just clicking on an item on the menu. Instead, you have to jump to a subsequent ""title"" on the disc to see them.So what are you missing? 2 fun items.1) A fake behind-the-scenes video on production 'overrun' costs that is about 16 minutes long. In this short feature someone is hired by 20th Century Fox to drive (and use his videocamera) to check out the set of the SIDEWAYS production area. His mission: find out why the movie is over budget when those working in the movie are putting in shortened work days. As I stated, it's all done for fun and it's worth a look.and2) A series of funny bloopers and shots of the crew on location, running about 14 minutes in length. There are quite a few fun items here. Definitely worth a look.Why these were made so hard to find on the disc I don't know, but  if you've got the DVD, pop it in and find them. They're very enjoyable.",Sideways (Region 2)

However these elements are used with purpose, usually to continue exploring the parallel drawn between contemporary hip-hop and gangster culture, and Edo period Japan where the story is set.  The use of graphic elements remind me a lot of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, and no, it is most certainly not for kids -- that's why it's rated  'mature'.  (And I must agree that this is by no means the most explicit anime ever produced, though it's possibly the most adult themed anime to show on Cartoon Network.)Incredibly well written, beautifully drawn and directed (though I don't care for the zombie episode on this disc), with just amazing action scenes, it's just an extremely well crafted anime.

166568,"Now I'm not going to lie. I'm biased in this review. In my mind no one can beat the pure and utter genius that is Marlon Brando. He was a true inspiration to many of todays actors and actresses. Whenever you see him on screen the characters seem more real and the entire movie takes on a new dimension. When Marlon acted it was like looking at a artist painting. Marlon Brando has the ability to breath life into all of his characters and give them new meaning and a purpose. You can never take your eyes off of him. When the movie ends you're upset because you don't get to watch him anymore - he gets you to make such an emotional investment in the characters that you want to know what happens to them after the movie. That is the mark of a great actor.Now as for the rest of the movie? Superb. Eva Marie won her first Oscar with this role and even more amazing was that this was her first film role ever. She does a wonderful job of portraying Edie Doyle and your heart really goes out to her. She has great chemistry with Marlon Brando and the steam from their relationship seems to rise from the screen at points during the movie. When he bursts down that door and comes running in to kiss her....you tell me if you don't feel it.You then have the rest of the cast rounded out with such film greats as Rod Steiger, Karl Malden, and Lee J. Cobb. All three of them do a amazing job. Karl Maldens monologue at the docks after another death is truly touching and Rod Steiger plays the perfect yet horrible brother to Marlon Brando. In one of the most quoted scenes in film history you have Marlon telling his brother that ""  I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley."" That pretty much sums up the brother-brother relationship in this movie.But lets not forget the script and the director. Elia Kazan does a wonderful job with cinematography and his previous work with both Karl MAlden and Marlon Brando allows him to use the camera to help their performaces be even better. Kazan has a real knack for camera work and his films are really great to watch. As for the script - well, it's probably one of the most quoted films in history and it won best screnn play at the oscar - it also won best picture along with a good number of other awards. This picture also gave Marlon his first Oscar - he had been nominated three times before.So if I have to say anything abou this movie I would say that its a must see...it's a must own - its a must everything. No film collection is complete without this film and no one can call themselves a MArlon Fan without seeing this film.",N/A
211109,"Matthau was a veteran actor and Clayburgh was a rising star in Hollywood when this movie was made. This is a lightweight comedy-drama. There is some great verbal sparring between the two and you expect the movie to put them in situations that can take advantage of it but unfortunately the plot is not up to the standard of the actors.Clayburgh plays the first woman to be appointed to the US Supreme Court. Mathhau is one of the current Justices, a crusty veteran who doesn't get along with anyone else. The plot calls for Clayburgh to beconservative and Matthau a liberal. This helps get the verbal sparring going early.Unfortunately the plot starts to bog down and is a disappointment after the initial promise shown. The writers create some sexual tension between the two as Clayburgh and Matthau's characters get to know each other and understand where the other is coming from, each develops a deeper appreciation of the other while still disagreeing with the other's viewpoint. Unfortunately this tension is never released as nothing ever happens between the two.The plot really starts to sag when we find out that Clayburgh's ex-husband's company is implicated in a case that casts aspersions on Clayburgh's professional ethics. There are some elements of the real-life Whitewater case so perhaps the writers ran out of ideas and borrowed from the headlines in the newspaper. In any case this subplot is very uninteresting and the movie ends leaving you feeling it could have been so much better.Still, its a movie worth watching if only for the first half. Its pretty lightweight so don't expect too much.",N/A

This movie seemed to try harder at first than the second film did, but it boils down to a piece of crap that ties onto one little (yet very hot) scene with the first movie.  I was appalled that in the ending credits Tarantino, Rodriguez, and Lawrence Bender all get Exec. Producer credits for this film.  I can just see all three of them on the set, rolling their eyes.  I can't believe how this turned out after the first and second movie.  None of the characters are very likeable, Danny Trejo and Orlando Jones (!?) are both in this giving it a little push, but it doesn't last.  Don't see this film.

144970,"Fame is a movie about the four years of attending the High School of the Performing Arts in NYC. It starts off at the auditions and moves its way to graduation. Intertwined the students learn their craft, have dreams, and come into realization that the arts may not be all the glamour they thought it was. The extras in the movies are mostly students from the real high school and so there is some exceptionally beautiful modern dancing, music, and worthwhile performances.There are so many reasons I could give for loving this movie.First off the music is incredible. Though the title song Fame won the Academy Award, my favorite piece was Sing the Body Electric at the finale. It was amazing with the orchesta and the chorus of students with tambourines. It just makes you feel charged and positive. I admit to hitting scene select to that part just to hear it over and over. Irene Cara who has a part in the majority of the songs (also playing Coco), has the most beautiful voice, plus can really dance and act.I also love this movie because it hits a note with anyone going through self identity. The way that kids entering high school grow up into themselves. The character (for instance) of Doris demonstrates that a nervous, fearful, and withdrawn girl whose mother is obsessed with her success can blossom into a strong independent lovely woman. Another character I love is Bruno, who hides in his music, but eventually warms up to Coco's (Irene Cara) friendship and affection. I love the scene when she plays on the piano and you can see in his face that he loves her.The movie is also real in its portrayal of the hardships that these students are facing day to day such as poverty, violence, drugs, death, and sacrificing their health to be better performers. Fame shows the gifts these children have but also how grown up their problems are.The last thing that I really want to mention is how extrememly talented these kids are. The dancing is sensational. One character is a beauiful ballerina, while another is a sensational modern dancer. The music numbers feature a lot of beautiful choreography that makes your eyes move throughout. Everytime I watch it I focus on another student because there is so much movement to take in. This musical will really waken your creative spirit. It makes you feel young and alive.",N/A

The film is full of small 'events' none really leading into the other, but not scary either. In the end, (and this is not a spoiler, because there is nothing to spoil, and besides it's in the trailer) the house blows up, but the lights stay on in the front doorway after the rest of the house is gone.

487773,"The Incredibles is fresh, funny, and touching.  The film is so great in all ways that I wish I could give it ten stars.  The story is about Jack Parr, who used to be Mr. Incredible, a super-strong superhero.  But he was retired by the government, along with the rest of the superheroes, when our litigious-happy society got out of control, and the government could not afford to settle all the lawsuits against superheroes.  All the heroes were relocated, and told to just fit in with the rest of the populace, and to conceal their superpowers.And so our story begins.  Jack is married to the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter).  They have three children: Dash, Violet, and Baby Jack-Jack.  Dash and Violet have superpowers, but are discouraged from using them.  Mom stays at home, while Dad has become an overweight, depressed insurance adjustor. The themes in this movie are very valid and very touching.  One theme is: why bend over backwards to make EVERYONE feel special - then no one will be.  Jack questions the importance of going to his son's ""graduation"" from fourth grade.The main theme is that life is empty without doing what you are meant to be doing.  Jack meets secretly with another superhero, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to listen to the police scanner and to sneak in and help - unseen.  A mysterious woman offers Mr. Incredible a secret mission.  Seeking meaning in his life, Mr. I. seizes the opportunity, while keeping it from his wife.Superheroes are not the only ones languishing, and longing for the glory days.  Uber-designer Edna Mole longs to design costumes the way she used to.  When Jack comes to her to patch up his old suit, she designs a brand-new suit for him - and one for each member of his family, even though they are not practicing superheroes.Edna completely stole the show.

902170,"One of ADV Film's newest releases ""Gilgamesh"" is a bizarre mixture of sci-fi, mystery, and a dash of ancient history all served up with a gothic twist. When I read the original synopsis from a press release it seemed like a rehash of The Animatrix's ""The second Renaissance (parts 1 & 2) with the similar commection to Mesopotamia and the blocking out of the sky. However,having viewed the disc it now seems that this show is something comepletely different.The show quickly introduces the setting. The discovery of an ancient tomb belonging to the ancient Mesopotamian King Gilgamesh is discovered to have supernatural qualities. Hoping to capitalise on these qualities an international scientific hub, Heaven's Gate, is built over the tomb to exploit whatever potential lies within. A terrorist attack on Heaven's Gate causes a world-wide catastrophe known as the twin X phenomenon (the catastrophe happens on Oct 10) which interupts the electromagnetic fields on the planet rendering computers useless and changing the sky into a psychedelic mirror.The new world is a ashy, dark world where civilization is in decay. We are introduced to siblings Tatsuya and Kiyoko- brother and sister on the run from debt collectors. Their deceased mother left themw ith huge debts and their father has disappeared. Left to their own devices they are constantly on the run until they meet 3 mysterious people (the gilgamesh) who take out the debt collectors. Tatsuya and Kiyoko are grateful for their help but still have reservations about these 3 men.Another three people arrive working for a mysterious lady known as the countess. These being are after kiyoko and Tatsuya also but their motive sren't known. A psychic battle between them and the the 3 men known as ""gilgamesh"" ensues as the siblings are caught up in a battle which will determine their fate.These first disc really did a good job of establishing mood and introducing to the cast of characters. There are many questions that crop up while watching these first episodes which will have you wondering how everyone is connected and what their motives are for seeking Tatsuya and Kiyoko. Fans who like anime which really build up suspense and mystery will definetly enjoy. I was reminded of RahXEphon while watching the disc as I attempted to try and guess what was going to happen next.The animation was overall very good. The character designs are very different from your typical anime styles which has been applauded by some fans and criticised by others. The characters have a more ""western"" art style in the sense that they have full lips on most characters and the eyes are slightly more western comic book styled. Personally, I think the design work and really gives the show a different look while still maintaining its anime flavor.I am a little disappointed that there aren't any extras included in the collectors box. Given the current state of anime I guess we should be happy a artbox exists with so many companies trying to save money. Still, for $10+ over the DVD only version it seems a rather high asking price for just a box.Overall a great show - Recommended!",Gilgamesh: Orphans of the Apocalypse - Volume 1
633967,"Some people seem to miss the point: It's a movie for the kids! So I'm not going to bash it for its inaccuracies, or for how corny it is. However, I will criticize it for its lack of originality. This has all been done before in other movies. It borrowed a lot from the movie ""Major Payne"" (a way superior movie) plus it had stuff from other movies like Mr. mom, and home alone. The characters in the movie also have no depth, they are very superficial. They were pretty much there just to be there. It's a movie you will watch and then never watch again. It is definitely a movie not too many adults are going to repeatedly watch. It just lacked ideas. However, it did make my son laugh several times. So from a kids perspective, I guess it's not all that bad, even though I didn't care for it.Side Note: I actually have a bone to pick with Disney: I am so sick of Disney's subjective censorship in their movies. They are hypocrites! Let me explain: I watched the new ""where the red fern grows"" and Disney took it upon itself to edit all the gun fire out of the movie (and it's a movie about hunting), they edited all the violence to the point that you have to rewind the movie a couple times to make heads are tales out of a bad editing scene where a boy dies. They also edited the violence out of the dog fighting with the mountain lion scene; it was so bad that it actually looks like a stuffed animal fight. So Disney likes to edit out any thing it finds ""questionable"" or ""offensive, YET IN THIS MOVIE, Disney found it ""ok"" to encourage children to fight, be violent, and setup traps that could actually kill someone. Disney also found it ""ok"" that this movie uses terms like ""boobs"" (repeatedly) and uses a wrestling move term called a ""nipple crippler"" these are terms taken straight from this movie. I'm not a conservative or a prude, as a matter of fact, I have a potty mouth, and I am an anti-censorship supporter. I just find Disney to be a little stupid and hypocritical when it comes to what they approve of in their movies. After all, this is the first movie my son ever heard the words ""boobs"" and ""nipple"" Lets not have a double stand Disney, one is just fine!",The Pacifier
745242,"&quot;The 300 Spartans&quot; is the story of an impossible, yet inspiring, stand by 300 Greek soldiers against the greatest army in the ancient world. Richard Egan, a buff, second string matinee idol, is King Leonidas of Sparta. His attempts to back the full scope of his military in defence of Thermopylae is hampered by political squabbling. Undaunted, Leonidas sets out to destroy Persian king, Xerxes - all the while realizing just how futile his journey is and how tragic his destiny shall be. The usual prerequisites of half naked women and massively overdone battle sequences - that all Hollywood epics circa the mid 50s to late 60s had - are reinstated for this film. Visually, it's stunning. Dramatically: below par and very long on spectacle over substance.TRANSFER: Fox gives us a very clean, very nice looking anamorphic transfer of this would be classic. Colors are rich, vibrant and bold. Contrast and black levels are dead on. There is some fading present during several night sequences. Film grain is noticeable but not distracting. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum. Digital anomalies (edge enhancement, pixelization) are present but do not distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely brings back the stereophonic appeal of classic Cinemascope movies. There's a sonic breadth to the musical score that does not extend to dialogue sequences.EXTRAS: Theatrical trailers and a few TV spots. Big deal!BOTTOM LINE: This is a movie for people who truly love and admire Hollywood epics. But it does not represent the height or even the best that the genre can offer. If you're starved for this sort of entertainment, I would recommend either &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; or &quot;Cleopatra&quot; over this film.",N/A

904834,"This movie was made for TV, but still got on R rating on DVD.  This is probably because of the marijuana smoking the bad high school athlete does in the boys bathroom at one point.  Otherwise, even the violence doesn't have that Hollywood graphic detail.  The characters in this film display the sexual mores of, well, they don't.Tom Selleck is very good as Jesse Stone, the run down big city cop who brings his problems to be the chief of police in a small town where the duties are small and his foibles can be indulged without hurting anyone.  His best friend is Abby Taylor (Polly Shannon) and she is one of the best things in the movie.The movie opens with one of the town's few policemen finding a murdered corpse and a live dog.  As the movie progresses there are more murders and it becomes clear that these are the work of a serial killer.  Another plot involves a young schoolgirl who is raped whose mother wants the perpetrators punished, but everything kept confidential because of the shame her family would suffer in such a small town.  The girl caught between her family, the boys who did this to her, and just trying to survive her teenage years.  Jesse does his best to help her as does another policewoman, Molly Crane (Viola Davis).It is a decent movie, but just moves so slowly.  I guess that is to evoke the pace of a small town.  The music emphasizes how quiet and slow everything is as well.  Even at 87 minutes, the movie seems full length.  The performances are good, the story isn't special, but not bad.  Still it takes so much time to get things done.  I would love to have learned more about the personal lives of some of the minor characters and more background on Jesse.  Instead, we get to see a lot of contemplating and drinking of whiskey without much dramatic point to it.If you enjoy seeing Tom Selleck on the screen, and he is always enjoyable to watch, then this is worth the hour and a half.",N/A

Anyway...well done to  newline .....this is the kind of package I usually see from WB...so  its nice to  see another studio step  up to the plate and compete for quality content and production!I am adding this last paragraph after my earlier comments above...BUY THE BOX SET...the bonus disc has a wonderful collection  of features that you can not  get as a stand alone...from lovely memories of friends of Harold Lloyd to interesting histories of the motion picture process (camera and Lighting and demonstrations)...informative,interesting and entertaining....the producer of these programs is Eric Young and he should be singled out for his spectacular job..I hope he gets handed  more  projects because his treatment of these treasures is appreciated by those  who care!",N/A
746453,This is real history given at the freshman college level.  The main information is in the audio with the video as illustrations.This is in stark contrast to the junior high school level journalism-propaganda type programs on PBS that pass for history lessons.One shortcoming is that it does not give enough time to the espionage operations of the wars.  Another is some minor errors.  For example the Bismark is claimed to have been sunk.  The captain claimed it was scuttled.  Underwater photos of the wreck confirm this.There are some errors.  In the Vietnam portion they describe a general rotating out after two years (standard Army practice) as being relieved of his command.  They fail to mention that the final collapse was caused by congress cutting off resupply of critical items such as ammunition.  Tet 68 was a US victory.  Almost of the Vietcong were killed when they fought to the death instead of retreating.  After that the war was carried on by regular army troops of the north who wore civilian clothes.  Another error was their inferring that the US public in general had turned against the war by 1972 or so.  Nixon won the election by the second greatest landslide in presidential election history.  He won over the other candidate who wanted to stop the war immediately and withdraw immediately.,N/A

625011,"When this flop was first arriving in theatres, I thought that it would definitely recieve an ""R"" rating. But, since ""Troy"" happened, studio executives are giving films that should be all-out bloody battles like this turned to be a piece of cinematic crap like this. By the way, it is way too flashy and dumb. It definitely deserved better.""Alien Vs. Predator"" started out good. Along the way, as the humans were threatened by these alien forces, and the aliens were killing the people off, there was kind of a sense of hopelessness for the humans who were there investigating something. And, after the war between Alien and Predator started for real, it started to get really, really dumb. Partly because they only can have the amount of gore to fit a PG-13 and that the violence was SO fake!!! If you even stay for the end credits, you can see a very long list of puppeteers. The little Alien babies looked like puppets...go figure.And, even though this made a good amount of money in the box office, (because little kiddies got to see it) it deserved better-known actors. The ones that were in it were good, but it deserved big names if it were to be an all-out blockbuster. But the DVD is good, though. It has a 25+ minute making of featurette that is listed as ""AVP Promo"" - I don't know either. And it has some other cool things on it. It has different main menus. That's something you should notice. And the slipsleeve cover for the DVD is all-out awesome. But, that's just something that 20th Century Fox did to make it look appealing to viewers.

Come to find out I was the only one in the theatre for a half hour.  Pretty funny.  This movie was really the first foreign film I had ever really seen in theatres.  The story was excellent and original of any other film I can think of.  My only beef with the film is that it went on a bit long, however, using that time makes you feel the distraught that this father is feeling.A man comes home from work to an empty house with birthday decorations up everywhere.  There is a tv set up with a videotape ready to be played.  He gets a beer, puts in the tape and it is his wife and two children wishing him a happy birthday.  The two kids exit the room at the request of their mother, and the mother, Alexandra, starts a striptease for her husband.  As the tape goes on, his wife gets more and more cynical, and the dread gets thicker.  You cannot help but feel sorrow for this poor man.  As the movie draws to a close, it may be impossible to comprehend the type of sabotage commited by this woman.  Shock and awe!  Terrible what this man must now endure.Anyone who has read my past unedited review of this movie might remember some spoilers.  Well, I only edited the past review to appease the bookworm above me.  Obviously she doesn't understand that if people don't like spoilers, or if they think they could currently be reading one, they can.....I don't know.....not read it.  Me myself, need to read spoilers because the suspense kills me.Anyway, this movie is completely edible and quaffable; because when it's over, you will eat and drink this mans's sorrow for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",Alexandra's Project

This match in my opinion wasn't very special although it still was a watchable women's match-up. 6/10Bradshaw vs. X-PacAn alright match with a couple of highlights although all in all not too exciting. X-pac does get Powerbombed of the top rope and Bradshaw gets all bloody although the wrong person won this battle, X-pac in my opinion. 5.5/10WWE Hardcore Championship:Steven Richards (c) vs. Booker TThis match in my opinion was almost match of the night it was spectacular high flying hardcore match that you see between guys like Jeff Hardy & RVD. This match was still pretty brutal with a unique variety of weapons used such as trash cans, broomstick, sterling silver and tables. The match had multiple title changes which made the match more interesting. 8/10Hardy Boyz vs. Shawn Stasiak & Brock Lesnar w/Paul HeymanI did not see the point of this match Brock's match against Jeff Hardy at Backlash made him the huge heel character. It was short and above all else very boring with little of an arsenal of moves used. 5/10WWE European TitleSpike Dudley (c) vs William RegalVery disappointing four mins into the match and poor Spike has broken his ankle supposedly and then Regal beats him up. Then suddenly Spike rolls up Regal and wins. This wasn't a match. 3/10Stone Cold vs. Big Show w/Ric Flair as guest RefereeThis was the match that the crowd had been waiting for and it certainly delivered what it needed to do. Show dominates the first half of the match and then Stone cold with a cool Lou thez press from the top rope gaining him the advantage. Also tons of stunners in this match-up to Show, Nash and yes Ric Flair, an awesome match. 9/10Triple H. vs. UndertakerI was very surprised with this match it might've not been for the world title although throughout the match it seemed like a world title match.  This match displayed plenty of nice moves by HHH & Taker a lot of reversals throughout the match engaging the audience to decide who the hell is going to win. The ropes also break during the match forcing the two to use each other as leverage. Fantastic match 9.5/10Overall mark 53.5/80 making Insurrextion a B in which I believe that Insurrextion is the worth the money although do not be expecting a ppv with the calibre of Wrestlemania or Summerslam.

390349,"My Man Godfrey (1936) embodies why we like to watch old movies.  We are reminded of a simpler, more innocent time when people dressed, acted, and spoke with a degree of class that you do not often see in movies today.  In such old films, there is no bad language, nudity, violence, or graphic sex.  Yet much more is conveyed with a glance or a phrase than a whole modern movie sex scene.This movie is just hilarious.  The film opens with a bunch of rich ne'er do wells in a scavenger hunt for all kinds of bizarre objects.  The scene is pure chaos and pure delight.  One of the objects is to find a ""forgotten man.""  A young, pretty, somewhat airheaded socialite named Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) encounters Godfrey (William Powell) in a hobo camp and persuades him to come with her.  He soon becomes employed as the family butler, bringing some order to the chaotic Bullock household.It soon becomes clear that there is more to this man than meets the eye.  Godfrey has a mysterious past.  The two sisters start vying for his affections.  No one's life will ever be the same, as rich meet poor and some people learn some much-needed lessons.One of the funniest characters in the film is a permanent ""houseguest"" who has no employ but somehow manages to mooch off them.

599476,"24 is the best television show to ever hit the world. The show is based on the life of Jack Bauer(Kiefer Sutherland), a government CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) agent. The show is real time, a season is based on one full 24 hour day. There are 24 episodes, each episode lasting an hour, example: 12:00 A.M.-1:00 A.M.This show contains drama, action, shocks and twists. At the beginning of the season, Jack Bauer is told that an there is an assassination attempt on David Palmer, a presidential candidate, that will take place within 24 hours. While Jack is trying to figure out who is behind the attacks, his wife and daughter are kidnapped by the terrorists responsible for the assassination attempt. By threatening to kill his family, the terrorists want Jack to assassinate David Palmer and take the blame of the killing. What will Jack Bauer do?: Save his family and sacrifice David Palmer, or sacrifice his family in order to save the future President of the United States? This is only the first 12 hours of the season!!!I highly recommend buying the first, second, third, and fourth season on DVD. In my opinion, the first season is the best. Kiefer Sutherland is sensational playing Jack Bauer, this is his best performance. No one else can play Jack Bauer, because Kiefer Sutherland is JACK BAUER. Here is my list:1.) Season 12.)

916857,"Arizona Senator John McCain enjoys his present day life as an influential member of the congress, leading debates on important issues and influencing legislation. He often gets into conflicts over some of his stands, but none of these can compare to the conflict McCain experienced back in the late 1960's and early 1970's. It was during this time that McCain spent several years as a Vietnam prisoner of war. This event is the subject of this movie, which is based on McCain's book of the same name.In this film, McCain is portrayed briefly during his teenage years but the majority of the movie's time is spent either in Vietnam (inside the prison) or at McCain's military school, the U.S. Naval Academy. The movie begins by showing McCain (who is played by actor Shawn Hatosy) operating a fighter plane over Vietnam. He is shot down and has to parachute to safety; landing in water where some local Vietnamese come to his rescue and then promptly turn him over to the proper authorities. The film then alternates back and forth between scenes in the prison and flashbacks to scenes in the Naval Academy.There is some violence in this film, but it is nothing compared to what was actually experienced. And herein lies the main problem I have with this film. The director made this movie in a very toned- down fashion so that it would be mild enough to get past the censors and be shown on television. In order to accomplish this, he had to eliminate scenes of brutal violence; profanity; and tough talk. Because of this, the movie seems very unrealistic. If you have read McCain's book by the same name, then you know that the conditions and the treatment McCain and others like him endured were horrifying. None of this comes through in this movie. It comes across as a little rough and unpleasant, but nowhere near the awful, inhumane experience that it really was.Another problem I have with this film (which stems from the first problem) is the attitude of actor Shawn Hatosy and others who play the POW's. Hatosy's McCain character seems very bland, and rarely does he voice any concern over the nightmare he is living through. You can tell he and the others are not happy, but about the only dialogue you get is when McCain and another prisoner talk through the walls, between cells, by placing a cup to the wall. There is no intelligent dialogue, discussion of escape, feelings about the war or the captors, or anything else. This, again, makes the film seem a little unrealistic.This movie is 90 minutes in length and it needed to be another half hour (or more) longer to give the McCain story the attention and respect it deserves. McCain's story, as told in his book, would make for a great, dramatic, and powerful Hollywood motion picture about the atrocities of war. But the way it is presented in this film, his experience seems more like a bad day on the job than the horrifying experience that it really was.McCain, and the viewing public, deserved better.",Faith of My Fathers

Apparently it was released in 1993, but it really looks like it was filmed in 1984 or 85.Anyway, I was intimidated by all the reviews that described this as a dancy video, so I bought it, tried it once, then let it sit for 3 months before trying again. After just 2 tries I learned all the moves and began having fun with this video. Yes, it's more of a dance routine than an athletic workout, but I needed that variety. There are a series of segments, some more challenging than others, and they remind you when to pick it up and push yourself in an interval. So at the end you're definitely sweating and feelin' good. The moves are repeated alot, which makes it a bit easier to catch onto, but it's not so repetitive that it becomes boring. The music is upbeat, the group is lively, and Jane Fonda (despite the weird black lace bodysuit and ankle boots?!?) really delivers.",N/A
635020,"This new version of War of thw Worlds blew me away! It was the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life! The thing in War of the Worlds is the aliens. These aliens are brutal and show no mercy. They kill every human in sight and are smart. They are hard to kill. But this movie is really a sci-fi action thriller but mostly action. It actually starts in the begining.It's Saving Private Ryan with aliens except without the blood and gore and language. This is very intense. For example, shortly after the begining after a storm, something comes out of the ground. It's a big spaceship and a few seconds later,it fires a laser and starts blowing up any target it finds.Yes they are that brutal and they don't take crap. There are some comedy events in the movie and the special effects are the best. Anyone should see this movie at all costs! The action was better than I expected. WOTW will have you at the edge of your seat and will give you an intense movie. It's not dissapointingand to me, greatest movie since Saving Privtae Ryan. The aliens on Earth force people to make desperate measures for examples.1.Tom Cruise and the kids are in a van and are driving and people are everywhere. They actually try to kill them by hitting windows. Like this one part when there's a big hole in the windshield, this dude actually tries to break in by ripping the glass off with his bare hands!2.In the same scene, this guy robs Cruise with a gun and Cruise drops his gun. The dude takes the car and some dude grabs Cruise's gun and kills the guy who took Tom's car and everyone's trying to kill each other.

Apart from his weak appearance he fails to convince in his role as a mean and greedy drug addicted mercenary.Furthermore, he somehow manages to kick Vin Diesel's butt repeatedly!!!Moreover, what was the point of the Muslim cleric with his four acolytes???Or the Australian woman and the arrogant Englishman for that matter?Not to mention the obnoxious, spoiled kid who for some reason is not scared at being stuck on ""hell planet"" and who has a ""surprise"" for us later on in the movie.Unless of course the whole point of having these annoying characters in the film was for the audience to enjoy seeing them picked off one by one in true B-movie fashion (as I've seen other reviewers characterize the movie).In a nutshell, it's an average plot, the acting and the actors are very weak, the dialogues are poor and the special effects are very good.The potential for a great movie was definitely there, but the surprisingly poor acting/casting and the full of holes plot prevented it from becoming anything more than average.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a B-movie so one should not expect too much.Overall, both Vin Diesel as well as the rest of the ""cast"" do a rather poor job of trying to cover up for the mediocre plot; wait `til Pitch Black is shown on TV.",N/A
761492,"You can tell how bad the DVD is of this film; the website for which I am doing this review does not even list this title on DVD anymore.  No question, it is a terrible DVD transfer.  I am giving this three stars because it's a great film.  The screenplay is by none other than Walter Hill and one of the two leads, Robert Culp, directed--as far as I know, his only feature film directorial effort (he did direct a number of TV show episodes, different shows).This is a tough as nails noir film with Culp and Bill Cosby as two cynical PIs who get mixed up in a money laundering caper to the tune of 400 grand from a prior bank heist.  Also involved are a slick crime boss and his henchmen--one of them is played by a very young Michael Moriarty--and, echoing Chandler, an effeminate lawyer, as well as the cops.  The main two of that group are Vincent Gardenia, Sgt. Papadakis, and another early appearance, this time by James Woods at Lt. Wyatt.But the two title characters carry the film and they do a great job.  The dialogue is razor sharp and probably the most cynical in any film from the 70s, and maybe even since then.  These two guys are so jaded and emotionally hollowed out that when a tragic loss hits one of them, the other one engages in semi-banter to cheer the first guy up, not even offering any sympathy.Each of them carries an extra-long barrel revolver; each of them always wears a suit.  Boggs (Culp) drinks too much.  Each of them is divorced, but Hickey has dreams of getting back together with his wife while Boggs watches his ex dance in a strip club.As a writer, Walter Hill is almost always great and here he shows his stuff to the max.  Hill knows his noir; he smacks the viewer in the face with it, knowing just how far to go without being completely alienating.  He's a master screenwriter, no question.It's really too bad that the DVD quality of this film is so miserable.  Maybe one day a clean crisp transfer will be available.  Until then, as many others here have said, the VHS copy actually shows better video quality than the crappy DVD.  Shame on AIP for putting out such a piece of trash for such a punchy film.",N/A

The three silent films are marvellous with astounding new prints and orchestral scores.

Each chapter is an even-handed critical study and appreciation of each of her Hollywood films, ideally read prior to watching the movies in the set to gain a deeper appreciation.It has long been considered by vintage cinema buffs that Greta was 'above' the quality of the films she was cast in, Mr. Viera's book attempts to rein in that myth, take a step back and objectively assess each of her films on their own merit.The extras included in the DVD set are priceless, with particular reference to the screen test Garbo made for the unmade 1948 film 'La Duchesse de Langais', seven years after the final film she would ultimately appear in and also the alternate German language version of 'Anna Christie'.No fan of vintage Hollywood or Greta Garbo should be without this one.",Greta Garbo: The Signature Collection (Anna Christie / Mata Hari / Grand Hotel / Queen Christina / Anna Karenina / and more)
833600,"Based on the comics, this production directed by Japanese animators and the screenplay written in part by the director of ""Home Alone"" really brought good memories of when I first watched it in 1992. It came out the same year as Disney's ""Aladdin"". While ""Little Nemo"" is not as humorous and entertaining as ""Aladdin"", I found that this film was more engaging and I cared more for the characters. The storyline shares ideas from the comics and reminds me of ""Alice in Wonderland"". While Slumberland is not as strange and exotic like Wonderland, the setting still perfectly fits the storyline. The backgrounds I found impressive even today considering the advances in animation. The characters to me were well realized with some minor flaws (Icarus did irritate me in the beginning). And I forgot that the movie had songs, but they don't distract from the storyline and make you wait for the next number like ""Aladdin""(While ""Aladdin"" was really good; the songs and Genie overwhelmed the story). I would recommend this if you really like ""Fantasy-Adventure"" based animation like ""Spirited Away"".",N/A
805994,"In The Western Canon, Harold Bloom, probably the most influential - and some say greatest - critic, listed Angels in America (the play)as one of the important works. As a play, I see how it may work - great metaphorical, beautiful language and sometimes in iambic pentameter - very Shakespeare.But adapted to screen, I think it is the language that fails. It sounds contrived and unnatural. When Shakespeare's plays are transposed to films, the directors often find new ways, new settings, new mise-en-scene to match the metaphoric language but in the case of Angels in America (the series), the director does not and that's where it fails.Another thing that I do not understand is why Al Pacino is given the best actor in the Golden Globe over Douglas Kirk who plays a more central and convincing role. Marry-Louise Parker is undeserving of her best supporting actress Golden Globe award as she is most of the time, wooden at best.",Angels in America
620199,"I know that I might not be in the majority on this one, but I have to say that this is one of my top five movie favorites of all time.I loved this movie. I loved the idea of this movie, the acting in this movie, the way that both of those were framed and offered to the viewer. I love that this movie starts at the end and ends at the start. I love the visuals of this movie, the little details that you might not notice the first time around. I love that the books disappear when Joel tells Clementine 'bye' in her bookstore towards the end. I love the little loops that this movie makes, the twists and ties of things that seem so innocent, but that end up turning back and consuming themselves.Most of all, I love that this movie takes careful aim at the condition of being human and gives us all a second chance. I love that the writer decided to give Love itself an encore, a curtain call, a way to come back and make sure to make it work the second time. I love that this movie takes away all our hope, then gives back the seed of something new, something better.Aside from the raving lunacy I just put down...this movie is good. It offers us a possibility: erasing unwanted memories through science. It then takes that (non)existant science and asks questions about it, about the implications of it, about what our memories mean to us. Are memories something we should tamper with? Would we want to? What is the price of a memory? This is nothing new to movies, and there are other movies that deal with real world science, such as cloning, but I would argue that this one is more touching and close to home. This is something that could happen to any of us; not just through science either. With things like alzheimers and the like, the threat of losing our memories of ourselves and others is a real one. This is a movie to take an idea and really make you think about it. This is a movie that will make you cherish what fond memories you already might have.Bottom line: this is a must see.-LP",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

148998,"On of the most impressive things about ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (""Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"") is that it is not director Sergio Leone's best film, which would be his next one, 1968's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (""C'era una volta il West""). But this 1966 film has is where Leone moves from his first two spaghetti westerns, the Akira Kurosawa inspired ""For a Fistful of Dollars"" (""Per un pugno di dollari"") and ""For a Few Dollars More"" (""Per qualche dollaro in pi&ugrave;""), and starts playing on a grander scale.In listening to the commentary on the DVD version of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" I learned that all of the actors in his films were dubbed because Leone did not bother with sound when he went out to shoot his movies. If you remember how the invention of sound destroyed the more cinematic aspects of the movies by restricting movement so that actors could be near microphones, then you can appreciate the sense of freedom this gave Leone. The result is a distinctive style that goes well beyond Leone's signature juxtaposition of wide vistas and extreme close ups (often in a single shot, without a cut). Leone also likes to take his time, as evidenced by the final three scenes of the film, where Tuco searches for the grave with the gold, the three-way gunfight, and the parting of the two survivors. His films ran long and were routinely shortened (read: ""butchered"") for their American releases. But even so, there is a clearly boldness and a flavor to Leone's cinematic vision of the west that is as distinct as that of John Ford or any other classic Hollywood director of westerns you want to name.In the final film of Leone's ""Man With No Name"" triology, Clint Eastwood (now called Blondie instead of Joe and Manco but obvious the ""Good"" guy) has a new scam going as a bounty hunter who saves his captures from the rope so that the reward goes up and he can move on to the new town and do the same thing all over again. His pigeon, the ""Ugly"" Tuco (Eli Wallach), is not exactly happy with the arrangement and finally has the opportunity to reverse their situation. However the former partners find a new unity of purpose when a dying man tells each of them part of the secret location of $200,000 in captured Union cold. Our story takes place in the New Mexico territory (that is where the two particular generals mentioned had minor skirmishes during the Civil War), and the Yankees and Rebels are between the two and the gold. Then, there is the ""Bad"" Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), called Angel Eyes, who has also been on the trail of the gold.From an acting perspective the most impressive performance is that of Wallach, although this is partly by default. Tuco never stops talking while Blondie is a man of very few words (but great timing) and Angel Eyes communicates best when he narrows his eyes and glares at people. In the hands of another actor Tuco might have been more of a buffoon, but Wallach develops one of the most multi-dimension characterizations in the history of Westerns. In those brief moments when Tuco stops talking you can see his mind turning over what to do next before heading off full throttle in a new direction.""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" does stand on its own, even though it is the final film of a triology. I originally saw the film in a movie theater and did not see the previous two Leone-Eastwood collaborations until decades later on late night television. But while the order in watching Leone's films is of little consequence to the appreciation of any particular one of them, at some point you should enjoy going through them in chronological order to see exactly how within a five year period he went from ripping off Kurosawa to creating what remains my favorite western of all time.",N/A
488020,"Maybe I'm a sucker for early 60's retro styling, which is what the look of this film is based on. Or maybe I'm a sucker for super heroes. Maybe I like almost everything that comes out of Pixar inordinately. Or maybe I like the 60's style jazz they use for the music - especially at the end. Maybe I just like James Bond type movies, with all the gadgets and exotic locations - and there are plenty in this movie. Or maybe I love modern architecture and design. Maybe I just like the color red! I don't know - but this movie really worked on me, and it was great!Director Brad Bird has brought together all these elements, plus good writing, funny dialog, and enough suspense and surprise to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you're into the visual elements, your eyes will have a feast. Now that I think of it, so will your ears because, besides the music, the sound effects are awesome. What's really incredible is that you feel like the physical objects in this movie are real. Like Mr. Incredible's (Bob's) car - after it's been downsized to a normal, economy car - which is featured in several gags. It looks and moves like a real - albeit, toy  - car, complete with broken door. Same for most things in this film.There is a possible disappointment to the realism: the people don't look like flesh and blood, which you might expect in a world that, otherwise, seems so real. They look like animated dolls with rubber skin. But, somehow, that's okay. You kind of buy into the fact that these are cartoon characters rather than real people. And yet, I would love to take their place in some of those high tech environments - especially on the island where Syndrome hangs out.Something else that disappoints a bit: Syndrome. I couldn't get past the fact that he looked like a kid even after he had grown up. It's hard to take seriously or be threatened by a villain that looks like a kid. But maybe that's the point: the filmmakers have their tongues in their cheeks. Which is probably true of most of this film. It is definitely a spoof - but not totally. If you're a kid at heart, you'll be taking a lot of it more seriously than you think.All the characters are memorable, but I've got to say, besides Mr. Incredible, my favorite is Baby Jack. There just wasn't enough of him in the film to suit me; so I was glad the filmmakers provided an additional cartoon featuring him on the DVD. It's really funny.Even though this film was mostly about the art and design for me, that is not to suggest that the plot, dialogue, voice acting and other aspects aren't up to par: they are. That's why the movie is so darn funny and so entertaining. Craig Nelson (Mr. Incredible), Holly Hunter (Elastigirl), Samuel L. Jackson (Frozone), Jason Lee (Syndrome), plus the others all did incredible jobs.It's hard to think of a better word to describe this film than its title: incredible. It may not be quite as remarkable as Toy Story, which will always hold a special place in Pixar-lovers' hearts. But in many ways it is better, and certainly holds its own with the other offerings of the Pixar team. Those guys, themselves, seem pretty incredible to me.Waitsel Smith",The Incredibles (Mandarin Chinese Edition)

But one question...who chose the new music???..Peter Gabriel, Sting and Depeche Mode were removed from the DVDs!!!! The original airing of ""Come from the Shadows"" had ""Fragile"" by Sting on its soundtrack which was so moving and so appropriate for the episode... The original airing of ""Out of Control"" introduced Depeche Mode to me  (""Never Come Down Again"") and made me a lifelong fan of DM... If the artists initially agreed to have their songs played on the soundrack originally then why is it so difficult to include them on the DVDs?

256992,"Ah, here we finally have the first FRIDAY THE 13TH that isn't in a campground, and that alone makes this a change of pace. However, just because the scenery has changed doesn't make things any better. Now we're headed to the Big Apple, where Jason is about to make his presence known by everyone. Does he make it big in the Big Apple?A group of students and some teaching staff are headed on a cruise ship for a little lax and leisure while the big finals are looming close. There are those meddling kids, but then there's Jensen Daggett, who's actually one of the better leads since Tina in the seventh FRIDAY. We also find our masked maniac at the bottom of the lake, where Tina sent him back, resurrected by an electrical underwater cable. Once again, Jason has been brought back to life and he's decided to stow away on board a cruise ship...with an appetite to kill again. Rennie (Daggett) is trying to keep with him, and while Jason does have a few creative killings (did you like the sauna killing?), most of them are nearly blood-free, which makes the impact of the killings a lot less gruesome, and that kind of takes the fun out of Jason killing anyone. The one scene I'm sure some will laugh at and some will raise eyebrows to is the scene where one girl presents her biology presentation very scantily clad, with thong and bra and skeleton parts drawn on her. She tries to make out with the teacher, but ultimately he knows her motives are more about trying to get an 'A' from her ""effort"" than from any real schoolwork. It makes a very amusing scene, but she adds some sexy appeal to it. But this is Jason's time, and no one's going to stand in his way. By the time he's bored of the cruise and decides to pursue a band of surivors on the streets of good ole New York City, things start to get interesting again. That's where we find a rather subdued climax, and it left the door open to if the series was finally dead, or if it would take a different turn, now that Jason's been stopped in the big city.While still entertaining and enjoyable for the most part, the lack of blood and gore and stale humor tends to weigh down this film. JASON TAKES MANHATTAN remains the weakest entry in the Friday the 13th series, but if you're a fan of Jason and the series, no doubt you won't pass this up. The ninth installment, JASON GOES TO HELL, would bring the series back to full spark but for casual fans, what you find on display here in this entry might disappoint you.",N/A
853682,"Like the proverbial bolt from the blue, the first season of thehighly-acclaimed SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES has finally beengathered onto a 2-disc, 3-sided DVD set; one long awaited byanimation fans, comic page enthusiasts, and lovers of goodsolid drama. Its extra featurettes and occasional commentaryadds an extra treat to what is easily one of the mosteagerly-anticipated DVD releases from Warner Home Video.Amidst a sterling array of cartoon series which distinguishedthe 1990s (from THE SIMPSONS to GARGOYLES and more),the animated SUPERMAN is a standout classic. Fresh fromthe success of BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES, the ingeniousenergies of Paul Dini, Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett andassociates were focused upon rendering the saga of thelegendary Man of Tomorrow as the serious action-adventurepresentation that SUPERMAN was conceived to be over ahalf-century ago.Rendering SUPERMAN as a serious tale for tube and screen hasbeen no small order over the years. Consider the variousefforts to trivialize the character, and one can only wonderhow the character can continue to hold full interest andinspire vehicles as well-struck as the current seriesSMALLVILLE, or imaginative movie-makers such as BryanSinger, who is currently preparing a long-awaitedblockbuster promising to be as thrilling and evocative ashis pair of X-MEN epics.From a mid-1960 Gilbert & Sullivan-esque Broadway musicalborne from the camp-ridden hokum of that era's so-calledBATMAN series, and the half-hearted efforts of the SUPERMANfilms of the 1970s and 1980s (hamstringing the superb workof actor Christopher Reeve), to the even-cheesier camp ofthe 1990s LOIS & CLARK series, the presentation of SUPERMANon screen has too often been the image of an ineffectual clodin tights, a lantern-jawed strong man mouthing moralplatitudes which would have embarrassed even Dudley DoRight.For all the superlative efforts of Kirk Alyn, George Reeves,Mr. Reeve (despite lackluster producers), and the Fleischerbrothers in capturing the power and fortitude of the Manof Steel, the overwhelming image most have of SUPERMAN onscreen is the wooden bilge of SUPER-FRIENDS, its voiceactors mumbling dead lines masking as derring-do, itsstudios ripping off American myth & folklore with stolidfour-color blow chow odiously passed-off as ""nostalgia"",""pure entertainment"" or, perhaps most contemptuously,""popular culture"".Thankfully, Mssrs. Dini, Timm, Burnett, Glen Murakami andcrew would have none of this nonsense. The animated SUPERMANis a class act from the get-go, its rendition of the legendaryorigin a heart-stopper in itself. From its brief-but-tellinglook at the planet Krypton (featuring the most chillingportayal of nemesis Brainiac to date), to the injection ofa young Clark Kent fleetingly wondering if he might be somesort of freak, ""The Last Son Of Krypton"" delivers the pointof the series' compelling drama for all to see.In fact, the theme of participation vs. alienation is arunning topic of this saga. Nowhere is this presented moreeffectively than in the consistent intolerance of the saga'sarch-nemesis Lex Luthor (superbly voiced by Clancy Brown).His ominously-smooth tones dripping with snide racism, thisLuthor is the perfect foil to Kal-El's humble tolerance, andsets the stage for the discomforting paranoia which willfrequently confront SUPERMAN in later episodes (from ""ThePrometheon"" in this collection to  -most exceptionally- theseries' finale in the third season , the gripping ""Legacy"").As the series' creators created a classic film noir settingfor the animated BATMAN, so do they conceive a Metropoliswhose sun & spires are worthy of the Fritz Lang epic ofthe same name. Just like that film's METROPOLIS, the famedhome of SUPERMAN bears its hidden flaws and arrogantby-products, awaiting the chance to manipulate or usurpwhat is best for all.A superb team of composers delivers an ever-evolvingscore which portrays the grandeur and gravity of thedrama as magnificently as the best work of big screencomposers such as John Williams and Danny Elfman. Ledby the amazing Shirley Walker (whose SUPERMAN theme isamong the finest works ever conceived for symphonyorchestra), this team ably continues the grand traditionof Warner cartoon composer Carl Stalling in their abilityto meld modern thrust and timeless taste into a musicaljuggernaut which can sweep you into the heart of the story,or touch your sensibilities with the delicacy of a feather.One would hope that Warner and Rhino will finally collectthis work onto a CD collection, especially consideringthat the animated SUPERMAN is fast approaching its 10thanniversary.Not enough can be said about the voice-acting, easilyamong the finest to grace any cartoon. Highest compliments,once more, to Executive Producer Jean MacCurdy and VoiceDircetor Andrea Romano for their uncanny ability toassemble the finest artists around to bring such gripping,versatile expression to bear in such a consistentlywonderful manner.I'll leave it to you stalwart readers to discover the vastarray of dramatic talent contained here, but specialmention must go to the lead work of Timothy Daly and DanaDelany. Daly, best known for his work on WINGS and a brief-but-well-rendered FUGITIVE series, is exceptional as bothSUPERMAN and Clark Kent; delivering a strong, flexibleheroism and warm, perceptive humanity. None of DeanCain's sappy diffidence here.Likewise, the star of CHINA BEACH and TOMBSTONE bringshome a Lois Lane who's rat-a-tat pro, hapless target,and vulnerable friend all rolled up in one. Sharp, saucy,and full of heart, Delany puts Teri Hatcher's bubble-headed depiction of the intrepid reporter to shame.Aptly reflecting the finer changes of the DC comic seriessince the late 1980s, the classic Fleischer cartoons ofthe 1940s, and the thematic wallop of Sequential giantJack Kirby, the animated SUPERMAN is a stirring narrativeof awe-inspiring delight. This collection is but the firstof three projected packages, taking the storyline from witand peril to pathos and the ability to prevail, from thedeadly whimsy of The Toyman to the mainipulative menaceof Darkseid.Here is a SUPERMAN to eagerly watch, gain ethical wisdomfrom, and heartily enjoy. If, like this reviewer, you'vebeen waiting almost 10 years for Warner Home Video to geton the case, the wait is finally over.If you never saw this series, and your only image ofSUPERMAN is cheesy corn more fitting for UNDERDOG, thenconsider yourselves encouraged to begin your re-evaluationof a major fictional icon here.Heed the lightning.

476982,"Happy, Texas is a quick, easy film with expected twists, but made memorable by a very charming cast.  Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam star as two thieves who are mistaken for pageant directors.  Northam's Harry is the slick brains of the operation, while Zahn's Wayne is a slow, misunderstood brick of a man.  While trying to come up with a feasible plan for robbing the local bank, the men find themselves more and more involved with the outcome of the upcoming pageant and their relationship with the residents of Happy, Texas.  The beautiful Ally Walker co-stars as the local bank manager and Ileana Douglas is the wide-eyed pageant attendant who nearly bursts into frightened tears after watching Zahn's dance demonstration.It is a cute film and mostly just yuk-yuk laughs (typical mistaken identity comedy), but Steve Zahn elevates the movie with his sincerely spastic attempts to connect with the young girls as the pageant dance choreographer.  I was snorting I was laughing so hard.  Some mad comic energy, yet lacking that horrible self-aware Jim Carrey style--sweet, quirky, and over the top.

398260,"Before Ken Burns, we had books.In our continuing devolution, our history is being digitized.  And history can be distorted, too.  Career historians often sense that they are fighting a continuing battle against those who would put faith into the old saying that history belongs to the victors.But, there's another issue today:  history belongs to Ken Burns.  At least American history does.And if he decides to ignore Nikola Tesla, then Tesla will be ignored.Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and scientist, who was born on July 9 or 10, 1856 in Smiljan, Lika (Austria-Hungary) and died on January 7, 1943 in New York City.Among many other things, he invented radio after inventing wireless transmission.  He also invented a telephone repeater, rotating magnetic field principle, polyphase alternating-current system, the induction motor, alternating-current power transmission, Tesla coil transformer, fluorescent lights, and held more more than 700 other patents.Radio would not have existed without Tesla's crucial contributions, but he's not even mentioned here.So, Sarnoff (defined by another writer as ""a communist's idea of a capitalist""), deForest and others get the billing, and Tesla vanishes.  I'd guess it's because Tesla's not photogenic.Even though this is (intentionally) a short treatment of a big subject, I don't know how Burns can produce this and still call himself a historian.",Empire of the Air - The Men Who Made Radio VHS

777677,"Its difficult to judge this season of Buffy. After all it had all the hallmarks of being one of the best. There was multiple main character deaths, plenty of original storylines, an interesting villian. It really had promise. And yet...it didnt quite hit the mark.For some reason the soul seemed to vanish with this season. This may have been intentional on the creators part, but for some reason this viewer was left a little cold.For starters the character of Buffy became even more unlikeable for me. Her death brought about a kind of vacuousness that was only ever so slightly present before. Xander, once a wonderful and funny character, began his slow descent into nothingness. Dawn continued her pointless presence. And Willows so called increased power just seemed rushed and out of place(though admittedly quite cool towards the end).The one saving grace for me, as it has always been, is Spike. His character has always remained fresh and interesting. Even in this season where he endures countless acts of humilation at the hand of a very heartless Buffy, Spike retains his dignity. (This is disregarding the episode of ""Seeing Red"", which I have since learned was nothing but a last minute ploy to get Spikes character out of Sunnydale and into a new soul.)Of course this season had its highlights. ""Once More With Feeling"" is an amazing triumph. The songs are wonderful and brilliantly sung by the cast. I enjoyed Amber Bensons contribution most of all. I also like ""Wrecked"" and ""Smashed"" if only for the gratuitous nudity of a certain Mr. James Marsters;-}""The Body"" has a kind of eery powerful charm that leaves the viewer very unsettled. And the final two episodes are memorable, particulary for the dialogue between Willow and Buffy before their big showdown. Plus I did enjoy most of the early Nerds scenes. Andrew and Jonathan retained a kind of warped sweetness even when trying to be ""Crimelords"", that made you feel very conflicted over whether you should care what happened to them.I suppose this season seems like such a departure from the others because of the fact that the emotions of the characters achieve dominance over the action for a change. This results in an entirely different tone to the previous seasons. There is a disjointed structure in the narrative for example. One episode would deal with something important and then the next would disregard it completely. Our main villians are infact nothing more than red herrings and we lose the important characters of Joyce and Tara. The viewer suffers a lot of changes and upheavals, and unfortunately it doesnt really pay off. Not to say that all stories should have a happy ending but after such an amount of grinding misery it would help a little.Even dispite its change of pace and noticible lack of humour, season six maintains a certain level of distinction for experimenting with an already winning formula. It is quite fearless in taking these well established characters and situations down an new and much darker road and for that it should be given credit.",N/A

379445,"When I decided to watch this long movie, my attention was caught right away because of the Civil War part, and yet what kept me awake was the domestic war and the victor.  It's past my bedtime so I will keep this as short as I know how.I cried through parts as it was so unfair for such a cultured girl to be caught in the web of an old liar, who was no hero in the war but a young thirteen-year-old who survived his best friend and felt guilty for the boy's death.  He lured the heart-broken teenager into his web of deceit when she was most vulnerable.  Like me, she wanted out before it began but, unlike me, she endured and suffered more as a consequence.We make some bad choices in our lives and must sleep in the bed which we made.  It is never easy to declare defeat but, in her day, it was an impossibility.  It was a miracle she survived so much and lived all those years with her guilt.  Something similar happened in my family, but he lasted only a couple of years because of cancer.  It was kept from me, like most of the things we really need to know.  I have been to very few funerals, because someone else makes the decision not to let me know.This lady survived all of her children, and when the celebration for her honor approaches, almost the same as her husband was given, she relives his war terror and hardships and their combative, but loving family life through flashbacks.  This is where I cried, and I guess my eyes will still be red tomorrow.Diane Lane was marvelous as the young wife and Anne Bancroft spectacular as the celebrant who was confined to a wheel chair and living in a nursing home.  It's tragic what age does to us, even when we are still the young person inside.  She was intelligent enough to make friends with a pessimistic physics professor and they learned a thing or two from each other.It was fantastic to watch Cicely Tyson age as the family servant no one could live without, and the acting ability it took to change so much.  Her character was one of the best, even though it is hard to understand.I loved the war scenes with the Confederate flag. A few months ago, I was invited to join the Daughters of the Confederacy but declined as I figured I was the only rebel in my family.  Actually, I was not ready to look too closely into my father's side of the family.  Living in Sevier County during that time, I doubt that they were on the side I favor, and it might hurt more to know that than to pay so much to be an associate member.

100378,"I've never read a single Batman comic or watched a single (whole) episode of the original animated series. Therefore, my opinion of this movie is the opinion of a normal moviegoer who can judge Batflicks as movies in their own right, without getting hung up on whether or not they contradict the comics. And B&R not the only Batflick to contradict the comics, either. Both Batman '89 and Batman Begins contradicted the comics by revealing the identity of the killer of Bruce's parents, and removing the idea that any punk Batman faces on the streets could be the killer. Batman Returns futzed with the origins of both Penguin, who was originally just the normal son of the owner of a bird store, and Catwoman, who was originally a stewardess (and in later comics, a hooker). Batman Forever made the Riddler an employee of Wayne enterprises and made Two-Face the killer of Robin's parents - again, not from the comics. The only real complaint that can be levelled only against a Batman movie is that it's not dark enough - Gotham city should look, well, gothic, and not like a cross between a rave and a circus. That being said, I've felt for a long time that Batman & Robin, though not a great movie, is still a good movie, even if it's not a good _Batman_ movie. It's not Batman Begins, but then again, it's not Catwoman, either. If you look past the day-glo graffiti, laser light shows, and rubber nipples (which were sadly absent from Batgirl's costume...), there's a smart, solid movie under all of it. Unfortunately, this was lost among people who felt that it was too colorful, too much like the campy '60s TV series, and too different from the comics, and they blamed Joel Schumacher for running the franchise into the ground. But now that we have a Two-Disc Special Edition with a commentary by Joel Schumacher, we are all given a second chance to look at this movie in a different way. I must say that I'm VERY glad I listened to the commentary. Most of Joel's comments are anywhere from useless (""Batgirl is played by Alicia Silverstone,"" ""here's yet another shot of Gotham City,"" etc.) to simply amusing (""If you like a movie, you have hundreds of people to thank for it, but if you hate a movie, blame the director""). However, he does provide some extremely insightful information about why the movie was made the way it was. He denies allegations that he was trying to make the movie similar to the '60s TV series, saying that the show didn't even cross his mind. He even says ""I don't like jokes"" at one point. He says that he actually wanted to do a darker movie based on the Year One comic, but WB wanted him to make the movies more colorful, entertaining, kid-friendly, toy-friendly, and product-placement-friendly. However, he also accepts full responsibility for the way the movie turned out, admitting that he was happy to do the movie either way and pointing out that the script's writer won an Oscar (for a different movie). He explains how he chose the movie's villains, and that he went through every issue of the comics and every episode of the animated series that featured these villains. He explains why Bane was dumbed down, why Batgirl was made Alfred's niece, and why Bruce Wayne was made ""less self-absorbed"", and I think that all of his reasons are pretty good. In the end, you just have to take this movie for what it is. If you like grand, colorful, gorgeous, fun action movies with a lot of heart and wit, then you should like Batman and Robin. If you can't swallow such a movie just because it has ""Batman"" in the title, then you won't like Batman and Robin, but you should still give the commentary a chance.",N/A

Obviously that premise will allow to show the reduced list of involuntary candidates: a drunkard who suffers an accident, a sadistic dentist, a thief and finally a pros. Curiously three of these deaths are accidental but one is induced by the floristry's  owner and all of them are nightly facts. Additionally we have a broad display of characters depicted with sublime cynicism as the eat flower, the low budget Mrs. who lives according a predetermined script: familiar tragedy to get discount, and a masochist who thrives the dental interventions: Jack Nicholson in his beginnings.The film was made in just two days and remains to my mind as the most surrealist American movie until now. This movie joins to Hallelujah, the hills and the Troublemaker as the purest and genuine independent expression of the craziest humor in those decades.",The Little Shop of Horrors VHS

Being my favorite book series, the only complaint I have about Unfortunate Events is how depressing it is.  Of course, you can tell it's not going to be cheerful just by the title, but the movie makes it even more depressing with the wonderful score.  I didn't like how they crammed three books into one movie.  It's okay, but it's just not the same as the books.",N/A

963907,"""Jarhead"" is the true story of Anthony Swafford (Gyllenhaal) from basic training through the Gulf War.  Basic training is rough and reminiscent of the movie ""Full Metal Jacket"".  Swafford emerges from the training as a sniper candidate, and becomes best friends with his spotter, Tony (Sarsgaard).  Sergeant Siek (Foxx) is their commander, and sees them as the best snipers of the group.  In 1990, Swafford's unit is sent to Iraq to participate in the Gulf War, but this war is not a war for snipers, and he soon finds himself ready to fight, but never allowed to.The unit is trained and trained and trained to be their very best, but there is no outlet for all their training, and soon that begins to take its toll.  They are soldiers who are unable to use the skills that they have, and sooner or later someone is going to snap.Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the baby faced Swafford, and is a definite candidate for an Oscar nomination.  Sarsgaard, who has been in a number of films this year, finally has found a role to really shine in.  Finally, Foxx is perfect as a true Marine that loves being a Marine.  ""Jarhead"" is an interesting war movie that really has little war in it.  Its focus is on the people that are there to fight the war, and what happens when the highly trained men are not allowed to do what they have been trained for.  This is the best war movie in recent years, and I highly recommend it.",N/A
754138,"Upon first look at the Hitcher 2, your first question will simply be, why?  Why was this direct to video sequel to an 80's horror/suspense classic even green lighted?  Who knows, but it shouldn't have been.  Despite some relatively good stretches, for the most part the Hitcher 2, which retreads on the plot of the original, is a routine and predictable pot boiler.  An older C. Thomas Howell returns as Jim, who is now a troubled cop trying to put his past behind him and go away for a little R&R with his girlfriend (Kari Wuhrer).  Eventually, they come across a hitcher (Jake Busey) whom they pick up, and well, you know where this is going.  Busey is good as a murdering psychopath who may or may not be Rutger Hauer's character from the original film, but Howell looks so bored in his brief return as Jim, and Wuhrer's acting abilities are wasted leaving her as eye candy (which isn't such a bad thing).  The police force is presented here as ignorant hillbillies, a stereotype which the original Hitcher avoided, and the acting isn't anything to write home about either.  Predictable until it's end, which actually does offer a few nice surprises, the Hitcher 2 is something which should have never been.  Fans of the original will want to see this, but all others should avoid.",The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting
790348,"I can't think of another comic TV show that was on for so long, did so poorly in the ratings, and was such a huge cult/critic hit.When I think of NewsRadio I think of the ""whys"". Why did NBC move it so many times? Why was it so under appreciated? Why was Jon Lovitz hired to replace the sadly missed Phil Hartman in the doomed final season?This boxed set of the first two seasons (a season and a third really, since it started as a mid-season replacement) answers some of those ""whys"". Not only do we see the first 29 episodes as they were first aired, unedited and uncondensed, but we are treated to commentary on a whopping 20 episodes!  It's almost too much, as by commentary 18 you're hearing some things for the third of fourth time, but beautiful nuggets of information are abundant though out, even towards the end. My favorites are when Joe Rogan and Andy Dick almost re-ignite a 10-year-old fight over garlic breath and a stunning commentary by then NBC chief Warren Littlefield as he admits that he never should have moved the show around so much.In an age when the sitcom seems to be a deaths door, it's frustrating to see the networks make the same mistakes they did 10 years ago. NewsRadio could of been the blueprint for ensemble sitcoms, Rule 1-Hire comedians and comical actors not washed up actors with strong Q ratings, 2-Find a good time for your show and if it does well don't move it, 3-Hire good writers. Sadly few shows/networks follow any of these rules. Rule 2 doomed NewsRadio but the show lives on because it lived and died by Rules 1 and 3. I guess that's what still makes it so funny and so uniquely special.",N/A
459531,"This is really the last of the Clouseau films.  The others were cobbled together after Sellers' death and are not as enjoyable.  This film is actually quite fresh and very enjoyable.  Not only are the regulars in attendance, we get to meet the people who provide Clouseau with his fabulously ridiculous disguises.  It turns out that there is a store that provides them and is owned by one Professor Auguste Balls (done to a T by the remarkable Graham Stark).In this film, Robert Webber plays Phillipe Douvier, who is a gangster that his peers think is losing his edge.  So, he kills Clouseau as a demonstration that he is still a powerful man.  Well, everyone thinks he has killed Clouseau and that leads to most of the delightful humor in the film.  While the familiar elements of Dreyfus and Kato are here, everything is twisted pretty hard and kept fresh even though they are familiar.  We get to find out more about Kato and what he turns to once he thinks Clouseau is gone.  Amazing stuff.Dyan Cannon, at her most stunning, plays Simone Legree (ho, ho, ho) who is Douvier's mistress / secretary.  The mighty Dourvier is afraid of his wife who demands that he end his relationship with Simone which, of course, makes Simone angry and reckless.  Douvier intends to have her killed and she is inadvertently saved by the already deceased Clouseau.  Fireworks ensue.  When you get all this plus an inflatable parrot, how can you go wrong?",N/A
638398,"This IS the best movie of 2005. There is too many good things to say about this movie.1. The action is spectacular! I was literally on the edge of my seat for the last 2 1/2 hours(the first 1/2 hour was a wee bit slow but the movie wouldn't be the same without it).2. The special effect were fantastic. ""The popcorn movie of the millennium, setting a new standard for special effects wizardry.""Jamie Gillies, APOLLO GUIDE says.3. The story is the best! It is 1933, and vaudeville actress Ann Darrow (Oscar nominee for 21 Grams, NAOMI WATTS) has found herself-like so many other New Yorkers during the Great Depression-without the means to earn a living. Unwilling to compromise and allow herself to sink into a career in burlesque, she considers her limited options while aimlessly wandering the streets of Manhattan. When her hunger drives her to unsuccessfully try to steal an apple from a fruit vendor's stall, she is rescued-literally- by filmmaker and multiple hyphenate Carl Denham (JACK BLACK of The School of Rock).It seems that the entrepreneur-raconteur-adventurer is no stranger to theft, having that day lifted the only existing print of his most recent and unfinished film from under his studio executives' noses when they threatened to pull his completion funds. Carl has until the end of the day to get his crew onboard the Singapore-bound tramp steamer, the S.S. Venture, in hopes of completing his travelogue/action film. With that, the showman is certain he will finally achieve the personal greatness he knows awaits him around the corner...and although the crew believe that corner to be Singapore, Denham actually hopes to find and capture on film the mysterious place of legend: Skull Island.Unfortunately for Carl, his headlining actress has pulled out of his project, but his search for a size-four leading lady (the costumes have all been made) has, fatefully, led him to Ann. The struggling actress is reluctant to sign on with Denham, until she learns that the up-and-coming, socially relevant playwright Jack Driscoll (Oscar winner for The Pianist, ADRIEN BRODY) is penning the screenplay-the fees his friend Carl pays for potboiling adventure are a welcome supplement to Driscoll's nominal income from his stage plays.With his newly discovered star and coerced screenwriter reluctantly onboard, Denham's ""moving picture ship"" heads out of New York Harbor...and toward a destiny that none aboard could possibly foresee.(King Kong)4. The actors are great! Joining Watts, Black and Brody is an accomplished ensemble cast from around the globe. German star THOMAS KRETSCHMANN (U-571) portrays Captain Englehorn, commander of the Venture, who allows Denham and his ever-increasing bribes to persuade him to endanger the lives of his crew by searching for Skull Island. COLIN HANKS (Orange County) is Preston, Denham's put-upon assistant and unwitting moral compass, who attempts to keep his boss in check and the production from spiraling out of control. Young actor JAMIE BELL (Billy Elliot) plays Jimmy, the youngest crew member, whose experiences onboard the Venture prove more fantastical than any old salt's seafaring yarn. EVAN PARKE lends his talents to the role of first mate Hayes, keeping a watchful eye on young Jimmy and serving as Englehorn's conscience. KYLE CHANDLER takes on the character of Bruce Baxter, a ""B""-movie-level leading man cast opposite Ann Darrow in Denham's adventure movie. ANDY SERKIS (who performed the role of the CGI character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) provides both on-set performance reference and motion-capture performance for the ""Eighth Wonder of the World""...the title character of King Kong; he also appears onscreen as the eccentric sailor in charge of the Venture's galley, Lumpy the Cook.I myself have seen this movie twice and hope to go see it again!

676455,"Moulin Rouge is probably my favorite movie of the last ten years, and it's definitely in the running for my favorite movie ever.Baz Luhrmann revolutionized the movie musical with this film, and I firmly believe that Chicago (and, to a lesser extent, The Phantom of the Opera) owes its success to this movie.  I love movie musicals, but they're usually horribly cheesy because they're a direct adaptation from stage to film, and the two mediums are not interchangable.  On stage, you can go from talking to singing and dancing, and the audience goes along with that because they expect it.  The sets and costumes combined with the live audience remind us that it's not real, and so we can accept the spectacle of song and dance.  The problem with most movie musicals (West Side Story is a prime example of this) is that the film goes from a straight scene and dialogue to singing and dancing, and it's a huge jolt for the audience.  Throw in a more realistic set than you'd get on stage (such as the streets of New York), and it's impossible to expect the audience to suspend their disbelief.But with Moulin Rouge Baz Luhrmann created a surreal, larger-than-life, heightened reality where characters can break out into song and dance and the audience members won't bat an eye.  Through fast camera cuts, outlandish costumes, computer-generated animations (like the singing moon), and luscious sets, Luhrmann reminds us at every turn that this isn't real--and to just sit back and enjoy the ride.The casting for this movie was brilliant.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman play the star-crossed lovers Christian and Satine, and they do all their own singing--and they're better than you'd expect.  (McGregor, especially, has a surprisingly hauting, powerful voice.  The movie is worth watching for his performance alone.)  Richard Roxburgh is marvelous (and often overlooked) as the sniveling, rat-faced Duke who wants to keep Satine for himself.  The cast is rounded out by Jim Broadbent, who plays the larger-than-life manager of the Moulin Rouge, and John Leguizamo, who plays Christian's friend Toulouse-Letrec.This 2-disc DVD is packed with tons of bonus features, including two commentaries, interviews with the cast, documentaries, and uncut footage of the dance El Tango de Roxanne.  It's definitely worth picking up if you liked this movie.This film is, to put it simply, pure art.  Stunning visuals and fantastic performances abound, and there's so much to see that you'll catch something new every time.  I highly, highly recommend it.",N/A

568800,"Imagine a small group of would-be moral pioneers, intelligent but confused. With heroic ideals and some ordinary human weaknesses, they try to shape their lives according to half baked notions of reason and independence.  Their philosophy raises excessive self assertion to a virtue, and their unrealistic expectations of themselves and each other lead to conflict and emotional breakdown.It's a well played chamber drama.  I don't know how accurate its details are, but Helen Mirren and the others have gathered a lot of deserved praise for their acting.  Mirren offers an especially persuasive image of moral certainty, sexual passion, intolerance and a capacity for self deception.

271001,"Ok, I admit it, I was actually a fan of that 2 Coreys hype back in the day.  As I've been on a quest lately to recaputre my cinematic childhood, I picked this movie up remembering the 2 Corey hype and wanting to see it again with adult eyes.This movie was actually a lot of fun.  It captures an awkward time in our lives where we are desperate to break free with that just-about-to-get-my -licence feeling.  Driving means freedom and liberation, and like Corey Haim, we were eager.  As he was the one the story evolves around, in the way only an adolescent boy can, without the coveted licence and desperate for the affection of the most beautiful girl in school, he takes the car out for the night.  What could possibly go wrong?Everything, as it soon ensues.  Near brushes with death are accompanied by many bumps, scrapes and dents in the car, as well as encounters with happy, bumbling characters and his sidekick, Corey Feldman, and that nerdy friend (a well behaved Corey Feldman).  It's not the best movie on earth, no question, but we got to see a younger Heather Graham before Boogie Nights and that she's actually hotter now than then.  After this it was all downhill from there for the 2 Coreys.  Enjoy it for the physical humor and how the disaster unfolds.",License to Drive VHS
160168,"Seeing the films Mel Brooks has directed in recent years, it is hard to understand where he lost his muse.  His early works are full of genius and uniformly well-cast.  The Producers, Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein are all classics today.  The Twelve Chairs should be, for it rates with those other three as a film of comic genius.The plot is set in the 1920's USSR and does a masterful job of skewering the Soviet system while capturing the flavor of Russia.  Ron Moody is a deposed nobleman whose dying mother tells him that she hid the family jewels in a set of dining room chairs.  As Moody hunts them down, he inadvertently teams up with drifter and opportunist Frank Langella.  The villain is Father Fyodor (Dom deLuise), an Orthodox priest who hears about the wealth in mama's deathbed confession, and then cuts off his whiskers and joins the scavenger hunt.Moody is great in the madcap role he plays as former Marshal Vorobyaninov.  His legs-all-akimbo, owlish countenance is ideal.  Langella's character is a pathologically mendacious delight.  Dom deLuise overacts a bit and is somewhat intrusive.  Mel Brooks himself has a modest cameo as Tikhon, the Marshal's old servant, waxing nostalgic for the good ole days when he could enjoy being slapped around by the nobility.There's sometimes touchingly artistic cinematography, good pacing, and a neat soundtrack combining everything from the Internationale to the Brooks-written title song ""Hope for the Best.""If the film has a flaw, it's that towards the end it gets a bit too serious and loses the madcap edge that the jerkily-fast-photographed chase scenes gave it early on.  But that's the only star off the top for this gem.Well worth the price and a good addition to your collection!",The Twelve Chairs VHS
845148,"Don't get me wrong, I love low budget horror movies, and in fact, that was what attracted me to this film, not what put me off.Since it was low-budget, I can easily excuse the bad acting, fairly low quality sound, and brush aside the lousy special effects.What I cannot excuse, however, is a weak story that adds up to a far less than satisfying conclusion.  There are plenty of scenes and attempted scares that really have no place in the movie, (like the hot tub and the fence; you will know what I mean if you see the film.)  Worse still, since this was apparently shot on video, the picture quality is lousy, and the camera reacts extremely poorly to back light - (as well as low light, and most other lighting situations for that matter).More frustrating still, is that despite the film's best efforts, it is not in the least bit frightening, save for one scene in the very beginning that made me jump.  That won't cut it, especially since being startled and being scared are two entirely different things.As for DVD extras, there is one extremely lousy behind the scenes of production, one interesting featurette behind the computer effects and image layering, a number of deleted scenes, and a trailer, and a one ore two other assorted extras.But since the film is this bad, the DVD extras should not determine whether or not you give it a rental.

627512,"MEET THE FOCKERS was worth my time and money because we got Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand together all at once, all of them obviously having a grand old time chewing up the scenery in this so-so sequel to MEET THE PARENTS.  Sure, the movie is merely a copy cat version of the original, but throwing in Babs and Hoffman as Ben Stiller's parents is the coup de gras of this enjoyable film.  Blythe Danner may be the second banana to all the shenanigans of her co-stars, but she admirably holds her own, in the role of the wife of a real paranoid lunatic.  This time DeNiro DOES come across more vindictive and irrational than in the first, and there are times when you wonder why Stiller and Teri Polo just don't tell him to stuff it and live their lives without his constant judgment and interference.  But then we wouldn't have a movie would we?  Jinx the Cat and Moses the Dog steal a few scenes, but they aren't in the movie as much as you might have thought.  The little baby is cute, but he gets in the way after a while.  Suffice to say, it's the delightful Streisand in her first movie in almost ten years and her first supporting role and Hoffman in his delightfully zany Bernie that make this movie so special.  Whether it's the whipped cream scene or Hoffman taking on DeNiro in a friendly game of football, these two stars shine like the celestial icons they richly deserve to be.  They alone with DeNiro make this a movie well worth watching and not worrying how bad it would have been without them!",Meet the Fockers

Throughout the six DVD's -I laughed, I cried, I learned, I reflected - and through it all I came away with more respect for Oprah Winfrey than anyone else on this planet. I am inspired to truly want to be the best person that I can be.In this DVD collection, you will see that Oprah is as real as they come. She doesn't prepare all her interview questions, but rather, she is successful because she allows her viewers to see her, as she is...flaws and all. Tom Cruise sees this firsthand when Oprah talks to a future guest via satellite.... sans make-up with her wet hair and wrapped in her bathrobe after a shower. (As Oprah later confesses, ""Sometimes you can just be TOO natural!"")We have all made mistakes or social blunders, but Oprah admits them all. (Although, personally I thought her elephant ride entrance was great and looked like so much fun!!) She has the unique ability to laugh at herself; forgive herself; and then pick herself up and become better than she was before. And because she displays this with such transparency, you realize that you too can learn from your mistakes and become a better human being.You will rarely encounter a woman with such a spirit of generosity, which is so evidently displayed in this collection. She is giddy with anticipation as she prepares various surprise gifts such as the almost 300 cars that she gives an audience who are in need of new transportation. There is also a great clip of Oprah surprising her best friend, Gail, with a performance by Josh Groban. You suddenly realize that there is nothing in this world that this woman enjoys more than the ability to be generous with those around her who are in need.Oprah has given us 20 years of wisdom, insight, and generosity. She has proven to be such a role model with her book club, with her acts of kindness, with her love for humanity and her desire to give back to the world. Her presence has done more to help close the race gap than almost anything else I can visualize.I sometimes question whether the next stage of Oprah's life can possibly be more meaningful than what she is achieving through her show. On an almost daily basis, she demonstrates and is the epitome of what true growth in your life is all about. She makes us ALL want to be better human beings...to be kinder to others and to ourselves. She may have an impact in Africa or help in other areas of the world, but I hope that she will seriously reconsider before she ever decides to halt production of her show. I hope that Oprah will continue to pursue these noble projects during the summer hiatus. Because frankly, there are too many people who NEED to hear the message that she is sending: Be kind to others; be kind to yourself; learn from your mistakes and continue daily to educate yourself and grow.... and truly your life will be meaningful and rich.",The Oprah Winfrey Show: 20th Anniversary Collection

299269,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is arguably the most religious science fiction film ever made. It is hard to miss the religious symbolism of Klaatu (Michael Rennie), the strange visitor from another planet, who explores the neighborhood under the name of ""Carpenter,"" especially when he is killed and resurrected by his robot companion Gort (Lock Morton). The parallels between Klaatu and Christ continue as the alien brings a message for all of the people of earth that the people of earth are not all that interested in hearing. It seems that now that Earth is developing atomic power, the other inhabited planets of the galaxy are concerned that the new kids on the block are not mature enough to avoid destroying everything.I remember Michael Rennie from ""Lost in Space,"" where he played ""The Keeper,"" and he brings the same sort of strong, dignity to the role of Klaatu. The alien might be here to lecture the Earth people, but he sounds so reasonable in his condemnation. Besides, how can you disagree with his reasoning? Patricia Neal as Helen Benson is the calmest and most rationale female lead every seen in a science fiction film, black & white from the Fifties or any other type. Helen accepts the reality of the rather remarkable situation she and her son Bobby (Billy Gray) find themselves involved in without really batting an eye. Nor does her voice tremble when she utters the greatest alien phrase in cinematic history. Sam Jaffe is equally unperturbed as Professor Jacob Barnhardt, the smartest man on Earth, who comes back from lunch and finds somebody (Klaatu) has been editing the formula on his blackboard. In contrast to these paragons of humanity is Hugh Marlowe as Tom Stevens, who has been stepping out with the widow Benson but throws all that away to be the man who captures the fugitive alien. The man is just such a schmuck.The film is based on the Harry Bates short story ""Farewell to the Master,"" which was first published in the October 1940 issue of ""Astounding Stories."" Actually, screenwriter Edmund H. North only keeps the first part of the story, when the spaceship lands on earth, Klaatu and the robot emerge, and the humanoid is shot (check out the original story if you can track it down). Of course, in the 1950s, Hollywood was always taking great liberties with classic science fiction short stories. The other great example of this would be ""The Thing From Another World,"" based on John W. Campbell's short story ""Who Goes There?""""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" provides one of the most unambiguous alien messages to be found in a science fiction film (cf. ""2001: A Space Odyssey""). As an extra bonus, you have Aunt Bee sharing her thoughts on aliens. This remains a classic science fiction film, a rare opportunity for the intellectualism of the genre to be given free reign on the big screen. Not my favorite Fifites sci-fi film, but certainly should be on everybody's top 10 list for the decade. However, watching the movie again this time I was struck by the fact that Robert Wise took the same sort of approach when he directed ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" The weaker moments in both of those films have a lot in common.",The Day the Earth Stood Still VHS

62119,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" was widely panned at it's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 1998.  In ""Premiere"" magazine's end-of-the-year list of the critical consensus of the year's films it finished around 95th out of 100 films.  So why does this film have such a devoted following?  Answers to that can be found in this superb package from Criterion.  As for the film itself, it's true to it's subject matter.  Writer Hunter Thompson a.k.a Raoul Duke circa 1971 is deeply apprehensive of the decay that he perceives is at the heart of America.  How does one cope with such grotesquery but with copious amounts of chemicals?  The question remains in imbibing said chemicals do they help you cope or do they just fuel the fear and paranoia?  I do not feel that this film advocates drug use.  The preponderance of it is more of a reflection of it's central characters' dependence on it and it is played so broadly and grotesque that it would be made unappealing to any thinking person watching this film.  I think where director Terry Gilliam succeeds is in showing the decay prevalent in America, Las Vegas being the magnet for said decay.  I think where he is less successful is in illustrating the social upheavals of the day and the creative processes that drive Duke.  Johnny Depp, however, is excellent in capturing the spirit of Duke which is apparent when viewing the real-life Thompson on the DVDs supplements.  Benicio Del Toro is equally fine as Gonzo, Duke's partner in crime and attorney.  As for the supplements there are three commentaries and I chose Terry Gilliam's.  Like any good commentary, it sheds light on the creative processes involved in making the film and almost makes you think it's a greater film than it really is.  There is a filmed segment of Johnny Depp reading correspondence between he and Thompson that is hilarious.  Another involves a visit by Thompson to the set of ""Fear and Loathing"" that is interesting.  Lastly, there is a British ""Omnibus"" segment on Thompson circa 1978 that shows him as a man who is weary of people not separating him from the real person and the Duke alter ego.  On an eerie note, this documentary concludes with Thompson visiting with an Aspen mortician discussing how he would like his remains disposed of.",N/A
675954,"The Rocky Horror comparison is easy, I guess. Why? Well, it's a rock musical with transvestites in it, right? But it's much more than that. If you're a Rocky fan, and you watch Hedwig because you heard they're alike, expecting cult value, you'll probably be disappointed... even though Hedwig has more cult following than you'd expect, and in some places weekly screenings with costumes and audience participation a la Rocky are actually held. But Hedwig is much more than that. Aside from the truly great music (which I'll discuss in a minute) the story of Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a sad tale of surprising depth, encompassing loneliness, betrayal, sexual confusion and identity crises as well as a bit of simplistic but kindly treated Platonic philosophy, with a brilliant ending that leaves many question marks and is good for hours of debate and discussion.Hedwig and the Angry Inch is certainly not, as some reviewers point out, a niche film to be enjoyed only by homosexuals - though I imagine you'd probably have some problems with it if you're particularly homophobic or conservative. As long as you're open-minded, Hedwig (meaning both the film and the character) has the power to appeal and to move everyone; I haven't seen the stage version - Many people say that other actors who played Hedwig were better than John Cameron Mitchell - but John is absolutely electrifying in this role, surprisingly appealing and charismatic, as well as recognizable (which is quite surprising when you're talking about a transvestite glam-rocker from East Germany), and he acts and sings with all his guts. The fact that he is also the writer and the director, I think, really shows and it's for the best; the film is very personal, and you can tell from his acting that the character is all his own. Miriam Shor and Michael Pitt are both amazing in the supporting roles.Even if all of that doesn't work for you, the music is where the film really stands out, and it's also the biggest point of difference between it and Rocky. While Rocky was created and inspired by the glam rock scene, the music - with maybe a couple of exceptions, like the wonderful and biting 'Sweet Transvestite' - is the stuff of Broadway, or at least Off-Broadway. That's not putting it down; it was intentional. The music on the Rocky Horror Picture Show is for the most part musical parody, pop tunes of sarcasm and wonderful dark humor. The songs on Hedwig are much more serious business, and much more complex, too, and most of them sound like they might have been recorded by David Bowie at the very height of his career. The rockier, harder songs like 'Angry Inch', 'Exquisite Corpse' and the spectacular, show-stopping opener 'Tear Me Down' sound like Ziggy Stardust mixed with Iggy Pop and tossed twenty five years into the future, with heavenly power chords and thundering bass and drums; 'The Origin Of Love' is an amazingly beautiful epic rock ballad with gorgeous lyrics; 'Wig In A Box' is a spectacular pop song which is so catchy it would have made a mega-hit were it released in the 70s; and the closing song 'Midnight Radio' is so classic a power ballad that you'll find your hand immediately reaching for the lighter. The band is fantastic, they have a terrific sound and are all great musicians, but they let Mitchell have all the attention he deserves. By the way, the music used in the shooting is playback as is usually the case in such movies, but John's vocals were recorded live, and it shows in his very emotional and powerful performances that have the feel of a live concert. Also, each song - especially 'The Origin Of Love' and 'Wig In A Box' - is shot as a perfect video clip. The band members, though they are not actors, and hardly talk at all, all look great on film and are pretty funny guys, too.In conclusion, let's just say it's a great film and get it over with. It's not a trash film, or a cult film, or a gay film. Just a great musical and a great film overall. I dare you not to run and buy the soundtrack after you watch it.",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

833532,"The Last Man on Earth (Sidney Salkow/Ubaldo Ragona, 1964)I'd have probably ignored this film for the rest of my natural life. I've heard it reviled, vilified, and otherwise trashed by most every Richard Matheson fan on the planet and score after score of critics who fled, screaming and retching, from theatres upon its release. However, I have a friend who is a very big fan of movies that have that particular train-wreck feel to them that I find so appealing, and every time I mention The Omega Man, he counters with The Last Man on Earth. So  popped it into the player Friday night to see what all the fuss was about.The fuss is about atmosphere. It's certainly not about acting, technical proficiency, consistency, or anything else of that sort. Matheson adapted his own novel, but by the time the movie was finished, disowned the project, insisting that his nom de plume Logan Swanson be put in the credits (Swanson, Matheson was heard to say later, wrote ""some of the worst crap ever""). And, really, it is. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price, basically reprising his House of Usher role from four years previous) is a scientist who has survived a worldwide plague that has turned his friends and neighbors (and the rest of the world, of course) into vampires. (For vampires, they look an awful lot like the zombies of modern horror films; George Romero has, in fact, cited Matheson's novel I Am Legend as one of the main influences for Night of the Living Dead.) Led by Morgan's old friend Ben (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart, who turned up later in the infamous stinker Bloodsucker Leads the Dance), the vampires, presumably for lack of anything better to do, crowd around Morgan's house at night, shunning the mirrors and garlic he leaves on the door, banging the dies of the house with sticks and rocks, entreating Morgan to come out so they can kill him. (One wonders why Morgan didn't move into a high-rise, but one may be influenced by having seen The Omega Man too many times.) We get lots of flashback about how the plague spread, and then Morgan meets another survivor-- female, of course(Franca Bettoia of the Sandokan franchise), so they can repopulate the planet. Or something. Because, after all, this is an Italian horror flick, where nothing can go right.Much has been made of the pseudo-fascist imagery, and there is much to be said for it as a subtext, but where the movie really had a chance to shine is in the opening third, before the flashback starts, when we see Morgan going through his daily routine of cleaning up the streets, shopping, staking some vampires and tossing them into the plague pit (which is still aflame after three years-- which seems like a lapse in film logic, but really works, on an eerie sort of level), replenishing his garlic and gasoline supply, etc. There is an almost limitless potential for atmosphere in these scenes, which is evident because despite Salkow's hurrying through them to get to the picture's real plot (which doesn't actually start until almost an hour into the movie, when Price meets Bettoia), there's atmosphere in spades anyway. This despite the widespread and utterly false belief of directors in black-and-white-film days that you could film in the daytime and have viewers believe it was dark because a car had its headlights on. (There are a number of cuts in a scene where Price is dashing back to his house after dark where portions were obviously shot at, or close to, noon. Beautiful.) This despite the terrible acting by the zombies, and Price's woeful narration, which sounds more like he's already one of the undead than just some guy who happens to be tired of his lot in life. There's still so much in these opening scenes that works. One wonders what might have happened had the original option on the novel (optioned by Hammer, who had signed Val Guest to direct) panned out. Maybe Logan Swanson would never have reared his ugly head. ** ",N/A
422800,"Billy Bob Thornton's unforgetable should have been nominated for best picture. It's a fantastic ride with an emotional story and great relationships. Also, I never saw the movie Shine with Geoffrey Rush but I seriously don't understand how anyone could have acted better than Billy Bob Thornton. Where the heck is his oscar? For all of you that think that Jamie Foxx was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING in Ray, well, watch this movie because Billy Bob Thorton's performance is 10000000 times better. Just look at his posture, facial expressions, grunts, moans, and his accent. I find his performance in this movie to be the BEST ACTING PERFROMANCE EVER! Thornton wrote, directed and starred in this so just watch it for all of the effort that he put into it. And his performance is absolutely breathtaking. He'll make you laugh and cry your head off. This is a very sad and emotional movie.The movie is about Karl (Billy Bob Thorton), a man released from a mental institution a long time after he slaughtered his mother and her boyfriend as a child. Now, while, most of the critics call this man a boyfriend, he's not. He's a student abusing her and she's enjoying it. Karl freaks and murders them with a sling blade or as he calls it, a keiser blade. Karl is mentally challenged and now is finally released from the mental institution. By the way, for parents worriedfor their children, the movie doesn't show him kill them. He just tells the story of how and what happened. So for the whole movi, there is no violence that you see. Also, for language, there are literally no cuss words besides one scene of strong nonstop language. The movie is very powerful and emotional and is in my opinion appropriate for 13 years + children or mature children.Anywhere, from then Karl gets a job and meets a friend, Frank. Frank is a boy who has a nice mother who has an awful boyfriend. The boyfriend is racist and threathens to kill Frank's mom if she ever leaves him. THis boyfriend is masterfully played by Dwight Yoakam. So, this boyfriend is the only mean person in the story. He's the vilain. When Karl moves in with Frank, the boyfriend gets mad and sparks fly. Karl will then have to make a tough decision and will need to confront his past. The movie has amazing performances by everyone including Billy Bob Thorton, Dwight Yoakam, John Ritter and the actor that played Frank.THe movie is the best when Karl and Frank are together. They love each other and are best friends. They protect each other and they both reveal their secrets. Karl and Frank seem very similiar and you can see many parralels between Karl as a boy and Frank.The movie is very sad and emotional and will make you cry probably. You love Karl and I wanted to hug him. He is a very kind troubled man and Frank is the loving boy who cares for him. THeir life would be perfect if it weren't for the mean, racist and abusive boyfriend. I recommend this movie to everyone and I will definitely add it to my top 25 movies. And hopefully tonight, I'll enjoy American Beauty like I did this amazing movie. This is must rent and a worthy addition to any serious DVD collection.",N/A

Let's begin with the music... the band picked a great night to record because they are dead on and extremely tight. I'm still having a hard time choosing a favorite tune because they're all awesome and there is quite a spectrum to choose from. Some are straight metal, some rock, some ballads, and occasionally a progressive groove is thrown in for good measure.The video is very sharp and clear and the eerie lighting totally enhances the viewing experience. The video editing and camerawork is outstanding... it's not choppy like many concert DVD's that jump from one shot to another in a nanosecond, and it's nice when the camera is in the right place at the right time. Like camera on the guitar player during the guitar solo, duh! Again, outstanding work! The audio choices are stereo or DTS 5.1...  DD 5.1 is not provided which is fine since both mixes sound great. Personally I like to hear a concert mix sound live and this does well to emulate that.The packaging is great also... complete with a very cool slipcover and booklet. I have yet to see all the DVD extra's (about six hours long) and most of it, besides the videos, looks like it was recorded with a regular camcorder, so the sound and picture aren't great but there are some very humorous (almost Spinal Tap) moments, for example, the engineer explaining how he records each individual cymbal and drum in stereo with two mics.All concert DVD's should have the complete uninterrupted concert, great video without choppy editing or crappy superimposed graphics, great sound with multiple audio mixes, great music, and interviews/chatter as extras (not rudely stuck in-between tunes).

Jackson's ultra-smooth gun dealer character, to Robert de Niro playing a stoned out aging criminal, Pam Grier getting her due in screen time in the title role, and Robert Forster as the conflicted bailbondsman Max Cherry.  If one complaint were to be made about the movie, it is that it drags a bit in places.  Tarentino seems to go for a little too much dramatic effect with long scenes of a character walking or driving accompanied by the 1970's soundtrack.

146298,"In 1939 the world was moving on.  Warner Brothers, the Hollywood studio that owed its existence to Prohibition and the Volstead Act, was slowly weaning itself from gangster movies.  The genre's greatest star, James Cagney, was heartily sick of playing gangsters - How many ways can you hit a guy, anyway?THE ROARING TWENTIES, from the story ""The World Moves On"" by popular Broadway columnist Mark Hellinger, was `a memory' of the era Warners mined so successfully, and profitably, in the thirties.  It stars Cagney as Eddie Bartlett, a more-or-less good guy who fought in World War I only to return to a country that didn't quite know what to do with all of her returning soldiers.  Bartlett's two army buddies figure prominently in his eventual rise and fall - the slimy George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) and golden boy Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn).  Bartlett's first touch of the Big Bottom occurs early on after his return.  The job he'd thought was waiting for him when he got home is filled by someone else, and soon enough he sees and grabs at the opportunities presented by Prohibition.  Bartlett's ascent begins when he begins to manufacture his own bathtub gin.  Along the way Barlett enlists the services of old foxhole buddies Hally (right-hand gunsel) and Hart (legal advisor).  Bartlett goes into the speakeasy business with Panama Smith (Gladys George) and falls hard for pretty young Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane).  Of course it's lonely at the top, and with treacherous associates like Hally and rivals like Nick Brown (Paul Kelly), precarious as well.Cagney may have been sick of playing gangsters by 1939, but it's hard to tell that from his performance.  There's just something right about everything he does with a character who has to travel, convincingly, from the gutter to the penthouse, and then back again to the gutter.  It's a consummate performance, and director Raoul Walsh, best known as an action director, handles the intimate moments with delicacy and sensitivity.  Barlett's forlorn love for good-girl Jean, with good-boy Lloyd lurking around in the background, is doomed from the start, and Walsh and Cagney explore it to good effect.  Gladys George's Panama's miscast affections are also delicately painted.  Walsh balances the quieter moments with action scenes that would have fit comfortably in the later-day gangster films of Coppola and Scorsese.  In fact, the shootout in Nick Brown's diner is an obvious template for a similar scene in The Godfather.THE ROARING TWENTIES is a masterpiece.  The transfer print is in very good condition - I was so wrapped up in the story I really didn't notice any flicks or flacks.  Warners has loaded this one with fun extras.  There's a twenty minute feature titled ""The Roaring Twenties: Time Moves On"" featuring director Martin Scorsese and film experts Lincoln Hurst, Alain Silver, Mark Viera and Andrew Sarris.  The theme is the end of the gangster movie cycle and Cagney's and Bogart's careers.  The other special feature is Warner Night at the Movies, which opens with a trailer; a 1939 newsreel (""Worlds of Tomorrow""); a charming Lloyd French directed ""All-Girl Revue"" that features a young June Allyson as `mayor for a day' singing the forgettable ""We've Got to Make the City Pretty""; a Grouch Club entry titled ""The Great Library Misery""; and a color cartoon, ""Thugs With a Dirty Mug.""",N/A

632010,"Batman Begins is a slow starter. It goes into great depth about Bruce Wayne's history with flashbacks inside of flashbacks. This is done early on in the movie to such a pain staking degree that some people may think it was a mistake to expect this to be an action movie. People may chalk it up to a boring movie and stop watching before giving it a chance.Batman Begins may start slow, but it builds momentum so gradually that by the end you're on a roller coaster ride going breakneck speed and your not even sure exactly at what point the true ride started. Instead of being numbed by the non-stop, start to finish barrage of action, you're left with the thrill of having been taken through a progressive ride.Batman Begins also makes an unusual choice in using some of the more obscure villains. Most writers would typically go for the big names: Joker, Riddler, Catwoman et al. This movie goes for villains that you wouldn't probably recognize without being a fan. Sure anyone who has seen the animated series knows who Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow are. But this has some appearances by some villains even more obscure than that: Zsasz and Joe Chill for starters.While the character selection may seem to limit the audience to long time Batman fans only, what it really does is open the movie up to being taken to a place that most people have never seen Batman before.There are several little nuances that make this Batman stand out from any previous incarnations. Newcomers can follow it. Fans can appreciate it. This is said with all possible respect due to the amazing movies done by Tim Burton. Batman Begins truly is the best of the Batman films out there.",Batman Begins

Wes Anderson should have focused less on the film's hipster soundtrack and more on making the characters have at least a slight semblance to real people. Come on, you know your film is in trouble when a scene is so boring, you have to stick animals doing stupid things in the background to distract the audience from the pointless dialogue. Anderson needs to go back to writing his own films, and should take a break from Bill Murray, who also needs to stop playing himself in every movie he's in.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
83581,"With some 600 reviews extant, I have no idea why I was sent a free copy of this to review, but I have to admit I'm genuinely happy that someone out there likes me.  The subject of this two-disk + graphic novel extravaganza is a film that dramatizes the Sin City graphic novel series written and drawn by Frank Miller.  Miller's storylines are archetypical noir set in a city where it is always night, and the darkest night at that.  People just plain don't come to good ends in Miller's work.The original release weaves four different Miller stores.  The Hard Goodbye is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), a not-quite-borderline psychotic, who finds a moment of love only to have the woman killed as she sleeps next to him.  Revenge is slow in coming and not the least bit sweet.  Then there is a tale about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop who takes on a child killer and goes to prison for it.  Years later he gets to wrap up the grim loose ends.  The Big Fat Kill finds Dwight (Clive Owen) pitted against a crooked cop (Benicio del Toro) who doesn't know how to stay dead.  Next thing you know all the women of Old Town are in a war. And The Customer Is Always Right is a short that offers little explanation but somehow brings the story together.Robert Rodriguez's direction is brilliant.  Rather than remake Miller's artwork, he sets out to match it stroke for stroke.  This is one of those rare films where an adaptation of an artist's work is the next best thing.  Deft use of black and white with vivid splashes of color, capture the original's intensity, the framing and scene setting are inspired, and the casting is outstanding.  Even if you are put off by all the violence, sex, and harsh language, you will have to admit that as a piece of film work, Rodriguez has recreated Sin City perfectly.I prefer the original film to the recut and extended version though.  The original interweaves the stories, which gives the view not only a better sense of timing, but also highlights the connections between the stories.  In the newer version you experience the stories one at a time, and while this may make things easier to follow, the common threads in this film about the price of vengeance in a lonely world don't come through as effectively.  The interviews, commentary, and other extras are quite good, though, so this is definitely the version to buy.",N/A
877267,"While ""Whisky Galore!"" was the original name of this film in England, it was retitled at the time for it's American release to ""Tight Little Island"" and you may  know it by that name. It is by far is one of the best films to ever come from the British Ealing Studio. After WWII this studio created many comedies that are true gems to this day, and this is one of the best of the bunch. With a wonderful director and ensemble group of character actors, the film has a depth of personality that comes across from the script and the acting makes you feel as if you know these people, or you will wish you did.The story is a simple one, allowing for comic genius by the actors themselves. It is set during WWII and a remote Scottish island is banned from any liquor shipments due to war rations. Over the long period of the ""dry time"" the residents are beginning to crave a drink, whiskey to be exact. It is not so much that they are big drinkers, its the old mental trick that we always want something when we are told we can't have it anymore. On the other hand there are those that want it more than others - so much so they even pray about it. After another dry evening of missing the good stuff, suddenly a ship crashes on their shores and spills out fifty thousand cases of the amber liquid like manna from heaven right in front of them. The residents can't help but want some of it but the government wants to swoop in and take it away, and search the entire island for any missing cases too. The islanders decide to sock some away for themselves and so the great cat and mouse game begins. The antics of the islanders as they go to great lengths to trick the government officials is brilliantly funny.  All in all a very satisfying movie and for those that have seen this movie, it becomes something they will never forget. I highly recommend!",N/A
475678,"Chronologically, ""Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is supposed to be the first of a six-part saga, yet one gets the feeling right at the start that one is in the middle of something, almost as if there ought to have been a prequel before this one, as the vessel carrying two alleged ""ambassadors"" representing the Galactic Republic approaches one of the droid control vessels participating in a ""legal"" blockade of the planet Naboo. The ""ambassadors"" are none other than two Jedi knights, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), who have come to enter into ""negotiations"" with the ""greedy"" Trade Federation regarding the blockade.As Kenobi points out, they certainly were, only the outcome was, to say the least, not what was expected: a droid army is poised to invade Naboo. The Jedi smuggle themselves, undiscovered, on separate vessels and end up on the surface of Naboo. They encounter a rather dizzy-headed local, a Gungan named Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), who agrees to take them (apparently on pain of death) to his city, where Boss Nass (Brian Blessed) has little time both for the Jedi and the Naboo and dismisses them, albeit after he agrees to give them a transport and to let Binks accompany them. Plying the planet core has its own, rather fishy hazards, but they manage to get to the city, albeit after Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) and her entourage have been captured. A quick light-sabre fight despatches the escorting droids and the entourage escapes with the help of Naboo pilots and, in the particular case of the Queen's vessel, a little astro-droid designated R2-D2 (Kenny Baker).All is not well, however, as the ship is forced to divert to a planet called Tatooine owing to a malfunctioning propulsion system. Gui-Jon meets a rather sly and devious Troydarian named Watto (voiced wonderfully by Andrew Secombe, almost as if he were French!), who has exactly what they need, but credits won't do fine, much to his inner frustration. Amidala, disguised as a hand-maiden, encounters a little slave boy named Anakin (Jake Lloyd), who declares himself to be an avid pod-racer and being good at his hands, as his home-made protocol droid, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), shows, even if it is ""naked"", as R2-D2 points out. It turns out that he is not all he seems, but that would be to say that one already knows how he turns out later in life. All we should know now is that ""there's something about this boy"", given the snippets of evidence that attract Qui-Gon's attention: fast reactions and the fact that apparently he had no father, according to his mother Shmi (Pernilla August). Microscopic life-forms called ""midi-chlorians"" rest in the cells of all Jedi, and an analysis of the boy's blood reveals that he has them. Herein lies the apparent biochemical explanation for the ""Force"" (much to many fans' annoyance, as they would have preferred it to have remained mysterious and thus inexplicable).However, the fact is that, without suitable parts for their ship, they are stuck, so it is up to Anakin to participate in a colourful, yet highly dangerous and no-holds-barred pod-race - and not just because of the natural obstacles, but also Tusken raiders and devious ""slimeballs"" like Sebulba (Lewis Macleod), upon whom Watto is prepared to bet everything. Qui-Gon seizes his chance to capitalize on Tatooine's main strength/weakness, gambling, and Watto unwisely accepts the bet that would result in the boy's freedom. The pod-race is undoubtedly the highlight of the movie, being as it is a nod to the chariot-race in the classic 1959 movie, ""Ben-Hur"", but should only be seen as a vital link to the chain of events that would see young Anakin part, almost tearfully, from his mother, who advises him to ""be brave"" and not look back.Just when one thought one might relax, up comes a rather sinister light-sabre-wielding character, who briefly duels with Qui-Gon before the Queen's ship escapes to Coruscant, the home of the Jedi Council. There, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) outlines the situation: a weak leadership by Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) and ""greedy, squabbling delegates"" with ""no interest in the common good"". Political machinations are rife in the senate and, on Palpatine's advice, Amidala, now in full regalia, calls for a vote of no confidence in Valorum, since he apparently appears not to want to take immediate action as regards the invasion of her home planet. This vote is an opportunity immediately seized upon by the senate. In the meantime, Qui-Gon tells the Council, including Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the ever-wise Yoda (Frank Oz), of his conviction that the boy is the one to fulfil the prophecy of being ""the Chosen One"", yet Yoda sees danger in the boy, who fears losing his mother. Right here, Yoda makes references to the so-called ""Dark Side"", a path which he fears the boy will take - only more pressing concerns now require them all to travel to Naboo.The Queen is determined to take back Naboo from the Trade Federation and Jar Jar proves a most unlikely link, as he succeeds in getting Boss Nass to help them. While a classic scene from the 1960 movie, ""Spartacus"", comes to mind as opposing armies (in this case, droid and Gungan) face each other, the Queen's party, including the Jedi and the captain of her royal guard, Panaka (Hugh Quarshie), succeed in entering the palace and capturing Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson, who also played the pilot of the ship seen at the start of the movie). However, the mysterious double light-sabre wielding character reappears: Darth Maul (Ray Park) takes on both Jinn and Kenobi in a scene that ranks amongst the best choreographed fight scenes on film reminiscent of Chinese martial arts (""Wu Xia"") films. The two knights are separated, leaving one to face the attacker: one mistake proves fatal, and the end for one of the knights is predictable. It is therefore up to the other to avenge him, which he does. As he lies dying, Jinn makes Kenobi promise that he will train Anakin, a decision he had already taken, defying the wishes of the Council, who, at Jinn's sombre funeral, wonder who had been destroyed - the master or the apprentice Sith Lord: one gets an answer as the camera focuses in on Palpatine.George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" had already had an established reputation more than two decades by the time ""Episode I"" came out, and a lot of the criticism of the movie has come from people who insist on comparing this with the movies that started the whole saga. Yet every story has a beginning, and, while some characters have been dismissed by some as ""irritating"" and some dialogue as ""boring"", the fact is that it would be totally unrealistic, as in real life, even in ""Star Wars"", NOT to have characters who some people may think are ""irritating"" and NOT to have dialogue which some people may think is ""boring"". As Qui-Gon himself said to Obi-Wan, ""keep your concentration here and now"": meaning, perhaps, that fans of the movies ought to bear in mind that this story takes place chronologically first and so should ""forget"" most, if not all, of what they know of what happens in the saga later - black masks, heavy breathing and all.",N/A
609563,"HOLES is a movie that not only captured my attention, but left me wanting more as the end credits started rolling. This is a rare occurance for me - normally I'm pretty fidgety in the movie theatre, but from the second the movie started to the end of the credits, I was interested.When I first heard that they were going to make my favorite young adult book into a movie, I was a bit doubtful. I didn't want to see the ""Hollywood"" version of a book that I've read countless times, but after seeing the previews, I knew I would go see it. I saw HOLES in theatres three times, and bought the DVD on the day it came out.HOLES is one of the best book to movie transitions I have ever seen. The characters, scenery, and stories are all exactly how they are imagined, and it's hard not to fall under the spell that the cast creates (the fact that the boys were pretty much unknown added to this - had they used well-known actors, it would be a lot different, in my opinion). The extras on the DVD are great as well - commentary by some of the cast (this is probably my favorite extra, as it had me laughing all the way through), deleted scenes, and a gag reel.HOLES is a story of love, friendship, family, truth, racism, and loyalty. Somehow, it conveys the messages without being cliched or preachy, and it's a family movie that kids, teenagers, and parents can all enjoy.Highly recommended.Overall grade - A+",N/A
916250,"*First things first.... The front of the package of this DVD is emblazoned with the following eye-grabbing proclamation:''FROM OXIDE AND DANNY PANG (DIRECTORS OF ""THE EYE"")''Before you start getting wet & excited over that blurb, however, please allow me to facilitate your somewhat painful crash back to earth. This movie is comprised of THREE INDEPENDENT VIGNETTES (which is expressed clearly in the film's original Thai-language title, ''Pee Sahm Baht'' -- I'll explain very shortly). The first and second segments of the film were directed by Pisuth Praesaengaim, who also served in the capacity of ''writer'' and ''producer.'' The third/last installment is not even directed by the ''Brothers,'' in the strict sense -- it is directed solely by OXIDE Pang, independent of his brother Danny.I utterly HATE when DVD marketers act in such a deliberately disingenuous and deceptive manner, especially with many of the ''Asian'' titles -- they're assuming, I suppose, that everybody's ignorant and that nobody's going to call them out on their bull droppings. Al Franken has a term for it: he refers to words or statements that are ''technically'' the truth but which hide or cover over certain other pertinent bits of information so as not to tell the ''whole'' story as ''Weasel Words'' -- but there are OTHER statements, such as the one made on the cover of this DVD case, which contain ''SOME'' truth but which have been manipulated for the sole and deliberate purpose of misleading or deceiving -- these Franken refers to as ''sleasels'' ('sleazy weasels'). But I have to admit, though, that you all get ''cooler'' looking cover art for the ''Region-1'' DVD than those of us who acquired our DVDs of this title from the Asian market.The original Thai title, translated into English, is ''THREE BAHT GHOST.'' The average Thai citizen would automatically understand the reference. At one time in their history a ''baht'' (Thailand's basic monetary unit) could buy a comic book of whatever genre the reader was interested in -- romance/drama themes tend to be quite popular in places like Thailand, Philippines and Singapore, but ''ghost story'' comics were also quite popular in Thailand (much like our own ''House of Mystery,'' ''The Witching Hour'' or the old ''E.C.'' comics were to ''Baby Boomers''), and since ''one baht'' could buy the reader a ghost story comic book, such a publication became known as a ''One Baht Ghost.'' So, naturally, ''3'' ghost stories would together cost ''three baht,'' hence the ''cultural reference'' in the movie's original language title.It has come to my attention that the marketers of this ''Region-1'' DVD (which is still on ''pre-order'' status at the time of this writing) have apparently insisted on continuing to mislead their target American & Canadian audiences by following the lead of the Asian DVD marketers and supplying UNAPOLOGETICALLY INCORRECT English translations of the vignettes' original language titles. So, for those of you who hate having your intelligence insulted by ''translators'' who deliberately 'MIS-translate' & 'reword' important titles and key dialogue in Asian movies, for you I present the CORRECT Thai-to-English vignette titles (all others who enjoy swimming in blissful ignorance, please disregard):* The ''first'' installment's title, correctly translated into English, is ''Arm of the Dancer''* The ''second'' installment is entitled ''Female-Corpse Oil''* The last installment is called ''Vengeance''The three chapters are tied together by three female friends who are spending the closing hours in a cafe, each of them entertaining the others with a ghost story she's chosen to share. The stories are of different styles and of different intensities -- none of which overtly or overly terrifying; catering, of course, to ''Asian'' story styles & sensibilities. (Recall, as I explained in my ''So You'd Like To...'' guide entitled  ''FIND OUT WHAT SPOOKS ASIANS!'' that Asian stories and movies involving ghosts play mostly for tension & ''creepiness'' rather than shock & fright.)The first story tells its tale in a very ''traditional'' style, which only makes sense since about half of it plays out as flashbacks. Because of its subdued tone and ''sad story,'' however, it is almost universally panned as the weakest and least acclaimed of the three vignettes -- yet, it is for these very same reasons that make this installment of the movie my personal favorite of the three. The story recounts the history of a specially crafted drum and tries to determine why the spirit of a dead woman remains inseparably connected to it.Story number two involves a horny but unfulfilled single woman who learns of an oily substance which, when used on her desired conquest, will transform even the most upstanding & chaste of men into hyper-enegetic lovemaking machines who'll have eyes only for her. But it would seem its use sometimes comes with some very unpleasant side-effects.The last segment, which most viewers favor, involves a young woman whose body was found hanging from what would appear to be a suicide. But a young detective is not so convinced -- the evidence for suicide just isn't there, and it appears she was the victim of murder. And it would seem that every man she's ever been involved with has mistreated her in some fashion, and since she wasn't exactly pristine as fresh-fallen snow herself, any one of them could have had a motive. In his search for the truth behind her death, the detective seems to be getting a little assistance from the ghost of the dead woman. But is it ''justice'' the dead girl wants? -- Or ''vengeance''?The film's final moments with the storytelling girlfriends is also a very nice touch -- totally unexpected, catching me completely off-guard.Unfortunately, most people are not going to be able to relate to this film -- if not for expecting something as powerful as ''The Eye'' (because of that lying blurb on the package cover), then they'll be trying to hold it up to the unrealistic standards of films like ''Juon'' or ''Ring,'' and they will be severely disappointed for doing so. This film is what it is, and should be allowed to work on its OWN level, and not 'projected' onto. Even so, it's not exactly a ''stand out'' film: It ""IS"" from Thailand, after all -- a country not exactly notable for producing international hits, though they do seem to be getting much better at the game (you'll be hearing about a movie called ''SHUTTER'' soon enough, trust me).But if you're up for something that's a bit more heavy on the 'atmospheric' and 'moody,' and/or if you want to look at the ghost-story genre from one of the lesser-focused-on Asian countries, then it just might be worth your while. Otherwise, tread lightly -- try renting it first, if you can, and give it at least two good viewings before forming a opinion.",Bangkok Haunted

Kilmer is a talented actor but most of the movies that he is in are average. He was good as Batman, but the movie sucked. This movie is a good drama movie that is a thriller. It has suspensful moments, shocking moments and puzzling moments. This is one movie that requires the viewer's complete attention.

For example, his character Andy as an endless number of classic action figures that he collects in their ""orginal packages"" and has a custom made video game chair for playing his countless number of video games. Seeing that he co-wrote this film, proves that he is a comedic genius.The humor in this film does a great job of not being too over the top or have the jokes run too long. But this movie isn't just for those that like raunchy, sex humor. Soon after Andy (Steve Carell's character) meets a nice girl named Trish, the story kind of takes a turn and it becomes a very sweet love story between the two.I must say that just about every single character in this movie is funny.

798825,"The negative reviews here are really eye-opening in the level hostility they exhibit.  I see a lot of sneering condemnation of this documentary as ""propaganda"", ""ridiculous"", ""dishonest"", ""junk"", and ""GARBAGE"" (in caps no less), what I DON'T see a lot of is these negative reviewers challenging this documentary's evidence with any facts.  I just see a lot of visceral, emotional reaction.  It's pretty clear that these reviewers had their balloon popped and not only did not like it, they will not face up to it either.  The title of every one of those reviews ought to be: ""I know what I know; don't bother me with facts!""  On reviewer even states that he stopped watching less than halfway through the program.  Well how CAN his rebutal be an intelligent let alone informed one?And those negative reviewers who do try to cite facts get them WRONG!  One, for example, starts the shots at Zapruder frame 210, giving only 5.6 seconds for the assassination.  They really began at frame 160, giving over 8 seconds.  Another talks about that the Warren Commission ""moving a wound up 5 to six inches"" in order to ""put this wound in the neck"", and also talks about moving Kennedy's head wound up ""not one, not two, but 4 full inches from the Eop at the base of the skull to the cowlick in the center of the head.""!?!I've seen the Kennedy autopsy photos.  You can see them for yourself at any number of websites that a google search will turn up in less than 3 seconds.  The clearly show a large wound at the top of JFK's skull, not at the base, and they also show a wound at the base of the president's neck, not the middle of his upper back where the CTs claim it is.  The same reviewer asks: ""...now ponder for a moment, do you think a neuromuscular reaction is stronger than a speeding bullet?""  As a matter of fact, yes.  Yes it is. The reviewer also seems to have forgotten a basic law of physics: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  If the impact of a bullet had enough force to hurl a human body about like a rag doll, the recoil of the gun firing that bullet would be equally savage, and would hurl the shooter backward with just as much force.  Shoot a rifle like the one Oswald fired, and you will experience no such level of recoil.  Shoot such a gun at an animal of roughly the same body mass as an average adult human male -- such as a good sized white tail deer buck, for example -- and you will very often see the animal jerk NOT AT ALL, and instead, just start running in reaction to the hit.  I know this from experience.  A tiny piece of lead, weighing no more than an ounce or two simply doesn't have the ability to shove over a hundred pounds around like nothing, not even when it's travelling at 2500 feet per second.  It just zips through, making a hole, and the violent jerk, if there is one, is the result of a neuromuscular spasm.  And this is particularly true if the head -- the bio-electric generator that sends electric impulses out to the muscles -- is the target that is zapped.This documentary serves up a good healthy dose or reality.  A lot of people need to face it.  I never cease to marvel at how people believe that the CIA, the Mob, LBJ, the Castro regime, and/or some combination of any or all of the above carried off a plot to kill Kennedy without letting the cat out of the bag, and then, still more incredibly, the LBJ White House, the Supreme Court, the CIA, the FBI, the Dallas Police Department, as well as doctors, nurses, reporters, and any number of others ALL conspired after the fact to bury all evidence of this before it could reach the public, and in over 40 years, NO ONE among these hordes of people in the know EVER betrayed any part of the plot.  Give me a break.  Face up to reality people.  Just because you want something to be true doesn't mean it is.",ABC News Presents The Kennedy Assassination - Beyond Conspiracy

Hopping vampires dont get any stupider, the plot stupid and makes no sense, movie just ends out of the blue. the evil dead are only in the first half of the movie then are gone out of know where. Where they come from or or how they just dissapear is unknown. A very common Japanese flick that makes no sense . i have about 7 or japanese flicks and i would say 2 or 3 of them are ok.

213940,"This is the last real Jason film, and arguably the most vicious of the whole series. As other reviewers point out, it is the also last F-13 movie that made an actual attempt to scare the audience. Although the formula was already exhausted by the time ""The Final Chapter"" showed up, there was just enough vinegar left in Mr. Voorhees to make me nervous about getting in the shower after I watched this flick. The goalie is back, and boy, is he piss*d.""The Final Chapter"" closes out the more-or-less ""human"" phase of Crystal Lake's least popular citizen. In Parts II and III, Jason is clearly alive -- he makes noise (grunting), feels pain, bleeds, shows some concern for his own saftey, and moves fast. When he reappears in Part VI, he's a supernatural being, a dead man walking, who has the distinct advantage of being unkillable because he's already dead. Most Friday fans prefer this Jason, who was ably played by the big stuntman Kane Hodder in most of the sequels afterwards. Hodder definetly brought a distinctive style to Jason's movements, but I think the violently active Jason we see here is hell of a lot scarier.The basic storyline is this: at the end of Part III, the rampaging Jason has been put down by an axe through the forehead. Seemingly dead, he is taken to the morgue, where he wakes up on the wrong side of the morgue slab and promptly commits yet another vicious murder -- the stupid morgue attendant, Axel, gets his throat ripped open with a surgical saw and then has his head twisted off. Next goes a pretty nurse, whose extremely loud screams fail to rouse anyone in the building.Having set the proper tone, Jason wanders off toward the Lake, killing a fat hitchhitker on the way, apparently just for the hell of it (truly disgusting scene of her vomiting up a half-chewed banana as he knifes her). Seems yet another party of horny teens has taken up residence near his favorite killing grounds, and he means to do something about it with any and all kitchen impliments handy. Thickening this very thin plot are the Jarvis family (Mom, Trish, and young Tommy) who are actual Crystal Lake citizens who live next to the party house with their unfortunate dog, a pair of nubile twin sisters (also locals) and a mysterious young hunter wandering the woods looking for ""bears."" Non-discriminatory, Jason decides to kill them all. Having run out of counselors, he's now apparently decided to wipe out the town as well. Anger management, anyone?What follows is extremely predicatable but still kind of scary.  Jason just seems really P.O'd in this film and his murders are incredibly vicious. One poor slob gets a speargun through the crotch and is lifted screaming high into the air, like a shishkabob. Crispin Glover, who is far and away the funniest and best of the characters in the film, gets a corkscrew through his hand and a butcher knife through the face. And the dude in the shower gets a Jason loofah treatment guaranteed to eliminate skin both dead and living. The most disturbing murder, which also seems to take about 2 minutes, is Rob, who screams ""HE'S KILLING ME!!!"" at the top of his lungs as Jason stabs him over and over again with what appears to be one of those things you pull weeds with. I was truly sorry he didn't at least get a couple of licks in to pay Jason back for killing his sister, but I guess they were saving the big payback scene for Tommy.The logical gaps in this film are big enough to drive a tractor trailer through. Rob has a rifle, but he leaves it in the tent and arms himself with only a machete to fight Jason. Sure, that's a good idea, let's all do that. Jason always just happens to be in the right place to find isolated individuals....almost as if he read the script and knew when they'd be alone (and they say print is dead). Best of all, he manages to do things like throw a twin through a window down into a car parked right outside the front door without Ted, who is in the living room hearing it; nor does Ted hear Glover get murdered in the kitchen, like 5 feet away from him. Jason, who is like 220 pounds, can apparently do things like go up and down stairs, break glass, and nail corpses to doorways without people 7 feet away suspecting a thing. Dude, I don't care what you've been smoking, if somebody takes a speargun through the crotch, they'll hear his screams on Mars.The fact is, however, this is a scary film despite its silliness. There is just something nasty about his bulging eyes peering out psychotically from beneath that hockey mask -- like he wants to kill you even more than you want to stay alive.The last 20 minutes are relentlessly violent, and I loved watching Jason feint and dodge as Trish tries to nail him with the machete. And let's be honest, I was ready to see the big crybaby get his commuppance at the end. ""Die! Die! Die!"" How's it feel to be machete bait yourself, Jason?So that's ""The (not so) Final Chapter."" It would have been nice if they'd ended the franchise here instead of exploiting it until it became a running joke. I would have loved to have unleashed Jason on the studio suits who were responsible for ""Part V""....",N/A
525402,"Harry Potter is a young boy with magical powers.  He lives with his nasty foster family until the age of 11 when he is taken away to Hogwarts, a school of wizardry, for training.  It is here that he discovers his true heritage.  Much like at the Boston pub Cheers, everybody knows his name.  Turns out Harry's family has made quite a name for themselves in the land of wizards and witches.  Eventually he and his two new friends - awkward, put-upon Ron Weasley and snotty know-it-all Hermione Grainger - come to believe that one of their professors is up to some shady business, and venture out on their own to uncover the plot.What follows is an overlong, disjointed picture in which we are shown the many wonders of Hogwarts and occasionally, bits of an actual story.  Shifting staircases and talking hats may amuse the younger ones, but I found it all rather tedious.  The thrust of the story itself doesn't have much logic to it; if the sorcerer's stone is so precious and dangerous, why is it removed from the vault and placed in the care of an inept guard dog (and its equally inept master) to begin with?  The surprise villain isn't clever and serves only to trick the viewer.  Again, kids won't care, but adults will shake their heads in exasperation.I liked the critters.  There are numerous owls of various types, a talking boa constrictor, a shape-shifting cat, and briefly, a large iguana.  And Alan Rickman (not a critter) is wonderful as always.HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is a juvenile film that I wouldn't recommend for anyone that is older than its main characters.",N/A

Turns out this release is the movie that ran in theaters for a short time in later '75 of Alice's 'Welcome To My Nightmare' world tour. I remember seeing this movie in a theater, twice. Picture isn't perfect, but acceptable. Color may be a bit faded, but that lets the viewer(s) know just how long Alice Cooper has been at his craft. Some Cooper fans might find it somewhat amusing as Alice slurs on the vocals big-time during ""Eighteen"". The concert here makes full use of props like dancing demons, strutting / fighting giant spiders on ""Black Widow"" and ""Devil's Food"" and a cyclops during ""Department Of Youth"".

623677,"Quite impressed with this movie. The human fragment of the film is slender but well brought into focus by the director. The CGI and visual element was innovative and extremely exciting. The 'science' of the film - (can a film have science anyway?) was not as bad as many here think, it stands to reason that if a hurricane is powerful enough and the pressure at it's core low enough then it could draw freezing air downward from the upper layers of the atmosphere - in theory, however if it happens i dont expect it to happen like it did in this movie! There is plenty of global warming research out there which can not be dismissed as easily as a piece of entertainment, however. Back to the film, some of the dialogue was corny and badly put together...eg when one guy says to the woman 'Friedrich Nietzsche was the most important thinker of the nineteenth century'and she replies 'he was a chauvanistic pig who was in love with his sister'then he says 'he was not a chauvanistic pig'They should have left it like this with an uncomfortable silence (the joke being that he was not chavanistic but was incestuous), instead she replies 'he was in love with his sister' - ruins the joke. The homeless guy and his dog were lovable characters and added a spark of humanity needed to counterbalance the pampered preppie kids around them.I enjoyed this film and recommend it to any potential viewers with the warning that they should enjoy it as a piece of entertainment and a warning about the possible dangers of global warming - but please dont equate the film with the scientific global warming argument!",The Day After Tomorrow
850804,"Don't take my rating wrong, I don't hate this cartoon, what I hate is the way Lucasfilm has handled the property. Basically what this release is is 8 episodes from the first season of the show cobbled together to form two very unbalanced animated films. What we do get is basically 8 episodes of the show with new adult Wicket voice-overs. What we don't get is the opening theme song, original end credits, and I have a feeling original music (though I guess I'll never know since this will probably be the only release in this format.) At least the ""chapters"" are labeled with the original episode titles. I know this sounds nit-picky and in the vein of the ""complainers"" of the ill done reissues of the Original Star Wars trilogy on DVD, but come on. What is the purpose of releasing an old saturday morning cartoon, almost certainly because the fans demanded it for nostalgia purposes, and then heavily editing it so that it has almost no feel of how it originally aired?",Star Wars Animated Adventures: Ewoks
931251,"This an interesting slasher flick that takes place in a secluded mansion in the Italian country side.  The cinematography is beautiful and the women are gorgeous.  However, outside of the few slasher scenes there really isn't much to this movie.  Stephen King obviously has seen this movie because there's a few incredible similarities to his novel The Shining.We have a failed alcoholic novelist (sound familiar?) obsessed with his dead mother who sadistically abuses his timid wife who is terrified of their black cat named Satan.  When his mistress is brutally murdered, his wife suspects him of being responsible and the body count begins.  Who's the killer?  Could it be the novelist who is prone to alcohol induced black outs?  Could it be his timid wife?  Perhaps it's the shadowy figure that appears just before some one is murdered?  Maybe it's the ghost of his mother possessing the cat or his sexy niece who suddenly shows up on their door step?This is a fairly slow moving misogynistic film with a lot of unnecessary  nudity and sex but it was the early 70s so it's understandable.  The end is pretty good in an Edgar Allen Poe kind of way but first you have to trudge through several long drawn out scenes of sex and nudity before the final payoff.Recommended only for true fans of Italian ""giallo"" horror.

585415,"At the time of its release, ""Spider-Man"" was considered by many to be the best superhero movie ever made.  It has since been surpassed by three films, one of which is its outstanding sequel, ""Spider-Man 2"".  ""Spider-Man"" is still amongst the very best superhero movies, though, behind ""X-Men"" and in front of ""Superman"".Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, a nerdy high school student who undergoes a series of unusual changes after being bitten by a new species of spider.  Parker eventually becomes web-slinging superhero Spider-Man, in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Unfortunately for Peter, Mary Jane is dating Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose father (Willem Dafoe) is the latest threat to New York City.Sam Raimi, who previously had directed only cult films (most of which were excellent), proves that he is more than capable of directing big-budget pictures.  He does a great job of focusing on the adventure of the Spider-Man legend, as well as Peter Parker's impossible romance with Mary Jane and his need for secrecy.The cast is very good.  Tobey Maguire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker, making him a very likable character, as well as one that we can feel for.  Willem Dafoe is enjoyably over-the-top as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, while J.K. Simmons is perfectly cast as J. Jonah Jameson.  ""Evil Dead"" fans: Bruce Campbell is the announcer at the wrestling match.David Koepp's script remains faithful to the comics on which it's based, while never being too cheesy or unbelievable.  It's funny and well-written.Danny Elfman's soundtrack is excellent.  At times it's reminescent of his magnificent soundtrack for Tim Burton's ""Batman"".  The music really heightens the level of excitement for the movie.""Spider-Man"" is a fantastic, fun, and well-made superhero film, but it's also much more: it's a great movie.  Thanks primarily to the directing of Sam Raimi, the acting of Tobey Maguire and a high-flying soundtrack by Danny Elfman, this is a film that can be watched again and again.",N/A

Two years later the were reteamed in the movie that would elevate them to superstars, The Odd Couple.  The would make twelve films together (one Jack just directed (Kotch), one they would just have a few scenes together (The Grass Harp) and one they never had a scene together (JFK)).  Grumpy Old Men was the seventh film together.John (Jack) and Max (Walter) have been lifelong neighbors who have been feuding most of the time.  Both are widowed with children (Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollock).

790282,"I know that Meg Ryan feared the typecasting system, and she's worried that if she was to make another ""crowd-pleaser"" romantic comedy, audiences would get sick of her being the American sweetheart again and again. So she really deserve the credit for having the courage to surprise her fans with this provokative and daring sexual thriller. She goes to the dark side so that she can broaden her range as a actress. Everyone who had seen Jane Campion's films such as The Piano(Holly Hunter) or Portrait of a Lady(Nicole Kidman), were eager to see how she managed to transform Ryan into a different kind of woman. Afterall, she's so good at creating brilliant female roles. Unfortunately, the result is rather mediocre, not that Meg Ryan didn't submit herself emotionally and physically(she had some nudity) to this film, but it's because the script is weak, and it's hard for a viewer like myself to feel any sympathy towards her character.It's a kinky and mysterious experience for Ryan to endure in this film that covers murder, sex, manipulation(head game played by the twisted and highly sexualized cop/Mark Ruffalo). She's drawn to the mysterious and dangerous aspect of love and vulnerable to explore despite the dangerous consquences she might encounter. This film is dark in terms of the story and the lighting as well. It really doesn't have the artsy look of The Piano at all.Jennifer Jason Leigh is inappropiately cast as Ryan's sister, and she had little to do with minimal screen time. Mark Ruffalo tried his very best with his corrupted character, but I can't see him in this kind of roles, especially when his You Can Count On Me performance is so heartbreaking and totally opposite of this film.I know this film has been somewhat of a failure for both Campion and Ryan, because it bombed at the box office, and didn't have good reviews from critics and viewers, but it will always be the movie that had changed the way people see Meg Ryan.",N/A
635827,"It is amazing the level of sarcasm that has been generated among critics concerning Marvel's latest action hero movie Fantastic Four. Among the comments are ""more like mediocre"" or ""cheesy enough to clog one's arteries"". After seeing the movie, myself, I have to say that these annotations are childish, unfounded, and rather aloof.Fantastic Four was a great movie that centered around a development storyline of the beloved Marvel Comics superheroes Mr. Fantastic, The Thing, The Invisible Woman, and The Human Torch, as well as that of the noted adversary Victor von Doom, aka Dr. Doom. There were those who might have been looking for more fighting scenes, but again, the characters were those who obtained powers that were by and large in their unprocessed stages.I will not get into all the details about how those powers were gained from radiation exposure, because I feel that in terms of this vein of discourse, they are not necessary. What I think is important are the series of transitions that inflected the lives of the main players. As newfound abilities were acquired, so were additional, interpersonal dynamics that revolved around the characters. Among the conflicting subject matters throughout were individuality versus team reliability, beauty within versus beauty without, and impersonal logic versus passion.Though the Fantastic Four is a superhero teamup, the movie script nicely picked apart the traits and personalities that separated one member from the other. A careful introspection makes the viewer realize that just as those individualities were strengthened, so was the need to combine them for the purpose of dealing with societal threats. In other words, for the audience to better know the Fantastic Four as a whole, they had to look at the sum of its important parts and beyond.If a person contemplates the themes of the movie just at the surface level and does not explore what treasures might lie within, he or she, at best, might regard it as merely all-around fun, which I think is well-intended but amiss.To seriously compare Fantastic Four with Batman Begins or Spider-Man in terms of intensity or excitability is really a futile waste of time. What does separate Fantastic Four from those other movies is not that the attainment of extraordinary powers can change a person's mode of existence but that four separate personalities, albeit egos, had to find ways to adjust and fuse together those attitudes and unique, advanced capabilities to form the right stuff known as The Fantastic Four.Though there are negatives along with the positives that arise in virtually every situation, Fantastic Four, nonetheless, did manage to end on a good, high note. If there is an underlying message from this movie, it is that if people are not content with the constants in their lives, then there is always that glimmer of hope that meaningful change will occur so long as one wants it badly enough.",Fantastic Four

564326,"Alright, I'm back and I've rented it.  And the verdict is--well, not all bad. Not GOOD--not by any means--but not all bad.First off: the plot was okay.  It wasn't solid, and it doesn't stand up to any sort of scrutiny, but had this been a stand-alone and not a cheap-quel, it might have worked.  Maybe. The story was cliche. The tough girl is really a softie and she helps the naive guy.  I KNOW it's cliche, but I love that cliche.  It's too bad they didn't pull it off well. The characters made constant contradictions of themselves.  This thing might have worked if Scamp HAD actually been ""kind and decent"", or if Buster really DID think that ""Buster's trouble is Buster's trouble"".  ""But, hey, it's a kid's movie!  It doesn't need PLOT!""  Yeah, right!Animation: The norm for these Disney rip-offs is that the clean-up is nice, and a couple of seconds of animation are nice, with lots of inbetweens to fool the consumer into believing that this is quality animation.  Well, this followed suit, with a lot of sudden action and acting that didn't really help any of the character development or establishment.  Oh, and there were bad 3-D effects, as well.  No, wait--by ""bad"" I only mean ""really, REALLY OBVIOUSLY not hand-drawn"".  They might have been nice in an all 3-D movie, but they were horrible against these hand-drawn backgrounds.Third, if you're going to make a cheap-quel of something that's already MORE than resolved enough, at least stick with the original in SOME REMOTE WAY.  Okay?  I mean, they tried--they replicated the backgrounds and layout--but they didn't bother with the most important things like personality.  Tramp, after 6 months (in movie time), had had a complete personality transplant!  He turned from the cocky, charming rogue into the preachy, overbearing, unskilled father.  Lady lost any life or spark she once had.  Because, of course, moms and dads don't have ANY personality of their own, right?  They're just ""Mom"" and ""Dad"". Right? Wrong!  I mean, yeah, there would be some adjustment for Tramp in a family, but he NEVER got mad in the first movie.  He was so relaxed-sounding and charming!  Sure, the replacement voice had the same kind of sound to his voice, but all the cockiness and  whimsy of the original voice was gone and he just sounded--I don't know, FALSE.The thing that they lost the most, however, was the relationship between the people and the dogs.  In the first movie, the dogs were really DOGS.  Yeah, they had some human action (e.g. talking), but you could TELL that they were dogs becausea) the animation kept enough dog action/anatomy in these clearly human actions--i.e. characteristic dog lips and teeth, even though the dog is talking; Tramp rolls over laughing at Jock and Trustyb) the way they thought of humans was inherently doggish--calling the man ""Jim-dear"" and the woman ""Darling""; running out to meet Jim-dear when he came home, etc.So, this movie really only deserves two stars.

429806,"This review is for the ""Batman Anthology"" set, where each movie is packaged in a new, 2-disc special edition. There is also an older, ""Batman Legacy"" set with the bare-bones editions, and Amazon seems to be grouping the two reviews together.It's about time that Warner Home Video has finally given these superhero films the two disc, special-edition treatment they deserve. Each film comes with restored/enhanced video and audio, and all the special features one expects from a current dvd release these days; we get commentaries, archival music videos and trailers, making-of featurettes, interviews, retrospectives, and deleted scenes. The last bit will be of special interest to some fans, especially because the Batman Forever DVD finally includes those missing sequences we saw in the storybooks and trading cards (though they appear here in rough form). Also of interest to fans of the animated series is the abandoned ""Robin sequence"" from the original movie, where they got Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil to bring the storyboards to life. Overall the special features are excellent, and these special editions are not a cheap double-dip.The big question is if you should shell out for the box set, which includes the generally reviled ""Batman and Robin."" Personally I completely love the first three movies, and since the box set is about the price of buying them seperately or even cheaper, I'd say go for it. The Batman and Robin edition has enough special features to be worth the investment, and besides that the complete box set just looks nicer on my shelf. If you only like two of the four movies, it's a harder decision. If you can guarantee to yourself that you'll never be tempted to pick up more than two of the films, grab them individually. But if you're a collector who might eventually cave-in and get the others for completion's sake, the best bet is to buy the box set now.Either way, it's nice to finally own these films with all the trimmings.",The Batman Legacy Four Film Giftset  VHS

It has no English track, sorry, but many of us don't worry about that.Lots of gun battles, female robots and gritty dark streets. Is it EVER day?Good soundtrack, but not great. Lot of it seems to be plucked right out of the first movie.  Hehe. Plucked, get it?The plot was taken from one of the many sub-plots from The Ghost In The Shell manga (Vol One) but characters have been changed, details have been added, parts twisted and expanded on so much that you don't know it till the last ten minutes or so WHICH stand alone story was used.That way you don't feel cheated with an old plot and yet the story fits the setting because it, like the background, was from the same source. It doesn't feel forced.The Major does pop up a couple of times and the hound, just to let you have one spoiler, is in no danger. The hound is never in any danger - no body points a gun at him and he is never threatened in any way. His health may be in question, but he never dies on the big screen. Just like the dogs in _The Day After Tomorrow_ and _ID4_ he is the one person you KNOW will make it. Like that cat from Alien. Just to calm all you animal lovers.Don't worry - they kill off a bunch of humans, cyborgs and ""other"", mostly people who are no good and really should die. For the plot, anyway.I WOULD of given it five stars with cleaner subtitles and a English sound track, but what can you do?",N/A
290249,"""Cinema Paradiso"" (1989) was a great and much loved movie, written and directed by  Giuseppe Tornatore (Mal&egrave;na). The 2003 ""director's cut (""Cinema Paradiso: The New Version"") shows that the cutting, credited to Mario Morra (Battle of Algiers, Burn!) was work of genius. That is, what was cut, primarily the story of the film-maker's lost love with a girl from an elite family, swamped the story of the boy Toto and the town's misanthropic film-projectionist Alfredo (the Basset-hound-faced French actor Philippe Noiret dubbed into Italian, as in his other greatest screen triumph, ""Il Postino"") and the magic of movies. Young lovers torn apart has, um, been done before and done better, and those who loved the version of ""Cinema Paradiso"" that won shelves of award may be curious about the postadolescent story of Toto, but 29 of the 30 interim years is not in the 47 minutes that had been put back either. The longer story turns Alfredo into a darker (not to mention meddlesome) character. As the adolescent Toto, Marco Leonardi (Like Water for Chocolate) is pleasant to look at, but the compelling performances are those of Noiret and of Salvatore Cascio as the child Toto.5 stars for the released version, 3 for the director's uncut one. The DVD has both versions. For anyone who has not seen the movie, I would strongly recommend starting with the 1989 version. Then, a viewer who wants to know more will likely discover or relearn that ""less can be more,"" and, more specifically, that a masterpeice was cut out of a fairly mediocre love story.",N/A

While the formula never changes, the plot and dialogue repeatedly get better and better with each episode.  Fred Dryer is amazingly good at playing the role of ""Hunter"", a criminal-hating detective with a mafiaso family background.  Dryer is witty, cool and humurous without being annoying or without blatent over-acting.  Stepfanie Kramer is equally great as Sgt.

600207,"DS9's writing in this first season was a little poor--it lacked development and explanation.  It is always disappointing when something interesting develops, then is entirely ignored and unexplained.  Characters also often acted, well, out of character.  They would do things entirely unlike themselves and completely below their capabilities because the writers found it more convenient to write it that way.However, it is entertaining.  Some of the characters are very interesting.  Although this season is often far too topical and offers far less for discovery than it should, it is still fun to watch.The DVD setup was remarkably poorly designed.  The format for the episode selections is terrible.  We had to look at the box to figure out what sequence they aired in.  The extras on the last disk  are even worse.  They are randomly scattered around the screen, usually without even a description of what they are.  And they're FULL of spoilers about the rest of the entire series!!  Instead of just a perspective about the particular season, they talked about the entire series and gave away a lot of info as to what happens in later seasons.  It's like they gave no thought at all to the format and setup of the DVD's.I gave it three stars, because there's a balance between enjoying the episodes and having to deal with the poorly-conceived presentation of them.",N/A
896737,"I'm sure you're thinking ""now that the series has been completely milked for each season, it makes sense for Fox to put out these theme driven sets."" Yes, it does.  For those fans that were big on the mythology episodes and tolerated all the other ones between them, this is the perfect set to own. It also makes ""The X-Files"" more affordable with 15 episodes running the span of the series. The mythology story arc focused on the fact that extraterrestrial aliens have been among us since the beginning of time. Let's be honest about ""The X-Files""; like any show it had its share of clunkers. Most of the mythology episodes were highlights of the series. These episodes were built initially around Mulder's sister who was, he believes, abducted by aliens. His search pushes him forward into a dark, mysterious world where it turns out that aliens are the dominating force in every government throughout the world. It seems that they have plans to colonize Earth. Why and how is what Mulder and his FBI partner Scully must discover.With sixteen episodes spread over the set, the image quality is exceptionally good throughout. It appears as if these are the same transfers that Fox used for the entire series when it first brought them out on DVD. While they've been tweaked a bit here and there they do also suffer many of the same flaws including halos, edge enhancement and other digital issues. The 2.0 soundtrack is crisp and clear with nice reproduction of the dialog and the music by Mark Snow.In the new 30 minute documentary Carter comments on how Gillian Anderson's real-life pregnancy impacted the storytelling arc of the series. Suddenly, Carter and his crew had to create a series of episodes built around her abduction and her unavailability for shooting. There's also a discussion on the development of the Cigarette Smoking Man throughout the series. When Bill Davis first appeared in ""The X-Files"" the writers didn't know how good an actor he was because they hadn't seen most of his work. So the episode where Mulder threatens the Cigarette Smoking Man with a gun had tension not only because of the conflict but because they weren't sure how the scenes would truly play out. ""Colony"" and ""Endgame"" are two of the most popular episodes due to the creativity of Carter, Frank Spotnitz (who was brought in when Carter needed help on the series in developing the mythology). The two in collaboration created much of the complex narrative. There's interviews with Brian Thompson who played the Alien Bounty Hunter gives his take on the character. ""Anasazi"" one of my least favorite of ""The X-Files"" two parters takes on new life (pardon the pun) due to some of the comments from Carter and Spotnitz. Inspired by a trip to Sedona, Arizona where he saw images that reminded him of drawings of aliens, Carter crafted the cliffhanger for season two advancing the series again. The complexity between the first season vs. the second season is like comparing learning the alphabet to reading whole sentences; both are important but one expressed sounds the other ideas.Featuring new commentary tracks by the directors and writers of each episode, this set is more than just a reissue or repackaging. Fox has attempted with these new commentary tracks and short documentary to provide additional value much as they did with the season boxed sets. On the other hand, it is a selling point designed to move more product among fans. For example, Director R. W. Goodwin does the commentary track for ""Anasazi"" and he provides both quite a bit of trivia about the mythology episode we're watching as well as trivia about the actual production.  We learn, for example, that the sequence where the boxcar was discovered is actually a quarry far from Arizona which Goodwin had his crew paint to match the sand in Arizona. They painted about a mile of the area. What the Indian community discovers there and what it brings to them changes that community forever but it also has an impact on the life of Agents Mulder and Scully. Carter's commentary as always is intelligent and insightful for his tracks.A creative show that fell on hard times by the end, ""The X-Files"" was a fresh, vital series for much of its run. The mythology episodes related to alien abduction are among the creepiest and best the series produced particularly ones like ""Duane Barry"".  In many respects the first season struck me as being only slightly better than the two 1970's TV series (and one of its inspirations) ""Project Bluebook"" and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"".. Combining that series with the dark conspiratorial tones of the post-Watergate era, these episodes are among the best in the story arcs Carter established.",N/A

I asked a friend of mine what he thought of this while WM3 situation, he shrugged his shoulders and said ""They eat there young down there"".  His attitude seems to reflect that of many people, that the subjects of this film (Including the murdered boys) were subhuman and it didn't matter what happened to them.  This attitude seems to be reflected in the actions of the so-called authorities who mismanaged this case from the get go.  Anyone with eyes can see the confession was laughable, that in any other state, almost, it would never have been admissible, but the individuals, I think, simply pinned the murder on these three simple minded boys, then railroaded them based on peoples ignorance and fear.  They cared less then not at all for the people they convicted and for the victims even less, they just wanted somebody, anybody to pin this on and they went with it.  When compelling evidence is found afterward to prove they are not guilty, they just ignore it so they don't look bad.  All that matters is that they are right, not the murdered children or the WM3, who cares about a bunch of inbred, illiterate morons with bad teeth?  They live in trailer courts and they talk funny, so what?  It is frustrating to watch and even more so as time goes on.

727432,"One of the best things about this dvd (I'm reviewing the second version of the Hemingway base story) is the interview with Clu Gulager. This was quite a surprise. It is a really outstanding commentary on what makes this film something special, and after watching it I am left with a respect for Gulager's brains and judgement which I didn't have, and had no reason to have, before. Gulager is careful not to denigrate any of his co-stars, or the director, or anyone involved in the movie. But somehow he lets it be known that, fundamentally, it would be virtually nothing without the towering presence of Lee Marvin. Play it a couple of times and you realize that the scenes which don't have Marvin in them are, let's be honest, fairly ordinary and even downright dull. Reagan is merely coasting along. Cassavetes and Dickinson are just not that charismatic, either together or alone: although Angie does seem to rise above herself in the final scene, just before Marvin plugs her. The story seems to drag, and there's too much padding. But, as Gulager stresses, Marvin's performance is stratospheric. Like the man says, every moment he's on screen, every movement he makes, every word he utters, is humming with pure mastery of the cinematic actor's art. He is colossal. That is why the film is so memorable, so unforgettable, even after 40 years.",N/A
685202,"I don't want to call this a horror movie. It is not particularly frightening.  I don't want to call it a thriller, because it moves at a very slow and steady pace.  I WOULD like to call it a suspense film, because from start to finish, there is a certain tension that you may not be able to put your finger on, but will haunt you even as the closing credits begin to roll.Session 9 is the story of an asbestos cleaning crew, working to clean out Danvers Insane Asylum (a real location, beautifully used in the film) within a week, an extremely difficult deadline given the size and scope of the job.  Their motivation is a substantial bonus if they meet their deadline.But tensions start to rise among the members of the crew...  Something about the building perhaps that seems to be bringing it out in them.  And, as the movie churns forward, you will discover that some of the men have may be hiding something as well.Director Brad Anderson keeps a slow and steady pace throughout, only escalating the pace in the final thrilling minutes.  He uses his gorgeous location to great effect.  The exterior of the hospital is gorgeous in itself, and is captured with some great aerial shots, but the deteriorating interior, with dripping pipes, slick floors, and graffiti covered walls, is haunting and leaves a lasting impression.  The sound effects and music help drive the film, and never feel out of place.  Everything is captured on high-definition digital video, I believe, but seems fitting.The acting is phenomenal throughout, and the movie feels almost like a character study rather than a suspense film.  And although it is not scary necessarily, (the IDEA behind it is a bit frightening), the film often draws comparisons to Kubrick's The Shining, and the comparisons are fitting.  Both films use enormous, lonely, abandoned buildings to generate tension and bring out the worst in their characters, and use steadily sweeping cameras to great effect, and both films are divided in to days, using titles (""Monday"") in similar fashion.The bottomline, then, is this: Session 9 is a terrific little suspense film.  If you are disappointed at first, I might suggest giving it another try.  For me, each viewing is more enjoyable than the last, and it was not until the second that I began to really appreciate it's genius.  Recommended.",Session 9
751200,"Here we go again with yet another disaster style epic from the 1970s. You know how the routine goes, don't you? Hire a bunch of big Hollywood names, some up and comers and some over the hill, and plop them down in the middle of a life-threatening situation. Irwin Allen made a career out of these types of films, weighing in with movies like ""Earthquake,"" ""The Swarm,"" ""When Time Ran Out,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" and a bunch of other titles. Some chap named Ronald Neame brought us a movie about an ocean liner turned upside down by a tidal wave in the 1972 classic ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" which Irwin Allen promptly followed up a few years later with ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure."" Obviously, the law of diminishing returns kicked in with this much product floating around, and the disaster movie quietly slipped into coma until Hollywood resurrected the formula at the end of the 1990s with movies like ""Armageddon,"" ""Dante's Peak,"" and several others. One film that seems to have slipped through the cracks, however, is Richard Lester's 1974 thriller ""Juggernaut."" Here it is, given to us on DVD by none other than MGM. It's an interesting entry in the disaster genre.It's important to note that Lester readily subscribed to the idea that a disaster film needs an all-star cast. To meet this goal he hired Omar Sharif, Richard Harris, David Hemmings, Anthony Hopkins, Ian Holm, Freddie Jones, Shirley Knight, Clifton James, Julian Glover, and Roy Kinnear to play major and minor parts. If you don't recognize some of these names, you'll likely recognize their faces. Taken together these actors have made probably a few thousand films. Anyway, the plot is incredibly simple. An ocean liner called the Britannic sets sail from England with some 1,200 passengers aboard. Unfortunately for these folks there are also seven bombs in seven steel drums scattered throughout the ship. The first sign of trouble arrives when Nicholas Porter (Holm), the chief executive of the travel company that owns the Britannic, receives a terrifying phone call from an individual calling himself Juggernaut. This man tells Porter about the bombs on the boat, and demands that the company pay him half a million pounds within twenty-four hours. If someone decides to drag their feet, the bombs will detonate and sink the ship. Yummy. Predictably the cops and the government enter the picture, namely in the form of Scotland Yard investigator John McCleod (Hopkins) and bomb disposal expert Anthony Fallon (Harris).The passengers, despite the best efforts of Social Director Curtain (Kinnear) to cheer them up, soon discover exactly what's going on. They can't leave the ship, however, since a storm in the North Atlantic makes using the lifeboats a risky proposition. All they can do is sit helplessly by as Fallon and his crack commandos parachute into the sea and climb aboard the ship to defuse the explosives. Standing by to assist in the tricky operation is the ship's captain Alex Brunel (Sharif), his main squeeze Barbara Bannister (Knight), and McCleod's wife and two children who just happen to be passengers on the boat. Fallon soon discovers that Juggernaut is a crafty devil, an expert bomb maker with abilities that may well surpass his own. The movie from this point forward falls into the predictable pattern of showing us the passengers moving about the boat at the behest of Social Director Curtain, scenes of McCleod trying to track down Juggernaut back in London, and Nicholas Porter arguing with the government over the effectiveness of caving into the demands of the terrorist. Seeing as how ""Juggernaut"" is a bomb thriller, you can bet your bottom dollar that we'll see a scene where Fallon agonizes over which wire to cut. Red or blue? Times a wastin'!I went back and forth with ""Juggernaut."" No one can argue with the level of talent here, as every one involved turns in a solid performance. Unintentional snickers, though, must go to Roy Kinnear for his spirited rendition of ""Roll Out the Barrels."" It's also nice to see Roshan Seth in a small role as Azad, a lowly servant on the ship who makes the ultimate sacrifice (love that Al Pacino haircut too, man!). What I do take exception with is the uneven character development. I suspect a lot of footage ended up on the cutting room floor in order to make the film move along faster because some of the interactions between characters don't carry much weight. You'd think McCleod would be on edge with his wife and kids on the boat, but he looks like he's ready for a nap. Too, the relationship between Bannister and Brunel seems superficial and doesn't add anything to the plot. Perhaps the greatest sin committed by Lester's movie involves what I call Annoying Kid Syndrome. I kept waiting for someone to strap McCleod's offspring to one of the bombs, or at least throw them overboard. These two are like fingernails on a chalkboard! But the tension works at times, Harris hams it up every chance he gets, and the ending is riveting despite being a clich&eacute;.MGM saw fit to give us ""Juggernaut"" with a trailer as the only extra, sad to say, but the picture quality looks very sharp. It's letterboxed, too. If you're a nut for these types of movies--the disaster movies of the 1970s, that is--I say give this one a shot. I'm struggling about how many stars I should give the movie. ""Juggernaut"" hovers somewhere between three and four due to the problems cited above, but the fact that it redeems itself at the end should count for something. Most importantly, it lacks the utter ridiculousness of many of Irwin Allen's destruction epics. Let's round up and say four for the overall effort. It's a good way to spend a couple of hours.",Juggernaut

This satire, very dark and disturbing at times, is as campy as any melodrama from the 60s, 70s, or 80s.  Imagine if ""Dynasty"" were all gay and the lead females were really drag queens.  Imagine if Joan Crawford was played by a drag queen in ""Mommie Dearest.""  Or better yet, the lead female in ""The People Under the Stairs"" was a drag queen!  Wait!  The last one was a drag queen!  This movie is all those things rolled into one.  The only thing missing was John Waters, but you can feel his influences.  A great deal of backstabbing, I think aimed at Debbie Renyolds, but could also be Crawford, Davis, et al.  A lot of bitchyness and sly humor.  The musical numbers are silly and funny.

910722,"This movie is kind of similar to Undertow and Monster's Ball. It deals with violence, crime, tragedy, forgiveness, redemption, and reconcilation. It's a great vehicle to showcase the relatively unknown Lisa Blount who managed to upstaged the rather low-key Billy Bob Thorton. Blount plays the title character who was traumatized and physically damaged by the car accident that took the life of her little boy. Her husband Joe(Thorton) was to blame for the tragedy, because he was smuggling drug in the car, and ended sentenced to prison for twenty years.During the time when Joe was absent, Chrystal lives alone with her dog Precise in an isolated farm, and she occasionally offers herself sexually to the local boys. She's constantly haunted by the death of her son, and still angry at Joe when he came home. They no longer connect emotionally and sexually. At one point, Joe ask her,"" Am I still your husband?"" She responded angrily and said,""If you just want my P****, just come and get it...."". He's trying to seek her forgiveness and start over again, but the worst thing was that she can no longer have children.The local marajuana dealer named Snake(Ray McKinnon, director and writer of this film) tried to persuade Joe to grow marajuana on his farm, but he declined, and things get nasty and physical between the two. Meanwhile, a travelling blind musicologist named Kalid is in town to gather research for his book, and becomes friend with Chrystal who used to be a good singer. This subplot allowed the film to feature many beautiful songs that resembles Songcatcher and some of the Bluegrass music featured in You Can Count On Me. Things gets even more ugly when Snake and his gang chased Chrystal and Kalid into the woods and want to gang rape her. Fortunately, Joe was hiding in the woods and rescued them. Will Chrystal be able to reconcile with Joe and let go of the the shadows of the past?Overall, the performances are very good, and the actors delivered their lines with impressive southern accent. This film is obviously very low budget, one would wonder how they could get Billy Bob Thorton to be in it. I loved the soundtrack, and I also was quite touched by Lisa Blount's performance, despite not having seen her previous works.",Chrystal

One of the most overlooked but greatest girl-movies all time, *Shag* is a meticulously crafted period piece that takes a look back at the summer of '63 - a hallowed summer cinematically, supposedly representing an innocent America untouched by the coming traumas of the Sixties. It is the story of four girls who have just graduated from high school who hightail it to Myrtle Beach - the forbidden zone of boys and booze. As they whoop it up, each of them has their eyes opened to a reality that is not part of the world their parents laid out for them. ""Y'all, I'm *wild*,"" Cates' character tells her friends towards the end of the movie, ""I guess I always have been - I just didn't know it,"" and Cates' youthful beauty and innocence make it completely believable. Page Hannah (Daryl's sister) seems to not take herself as seriously as her more famous sister does - and her hilarious portrayal of the tight-assed Luanne morphs from rigid propriety to semi-unbridled lust. Pudge finally meets a boy who loves her for everything she is, and Gish has a field day with the character. But it is Fonda's portrayal of the bad-girl preacher's daughter who steals the show.

224014,"Okay, so we all know the old formula--especially back in the 80s:  Boy wants girl who's out of his league while girl he only sees as a friend or doesn't know exists wants him.  Sometimes the genders were reversed.  Always, in 80s teen flicks, we see the same self-important oh-mi-gawd-type characters fill the screen in their high fashion and high hair.  Unlike so many of the decade's movies, however, this one is more timeless than, say, Sixteen Candles or Pretty in Pink which are very much of their time.What makes this movie effective more than John Hughes' direction or the script are very strong performances by some very talented young people.  The triangle of Eric Stolz as Keith, Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts, and Lea Thompson as Amanda Jones gels on every level and breathes life into a script that might not have taken off with any other combination of the day's most popular teen actors.  It simply worked, and that is that.  If you haven't seen this movie, I advise you to check it out rather than give much away.

Along with his friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander, trying desparately to add some life into his post - ""Seinfeld"" career), Hal scowers various dance clubs looking for beautiful women. One day, everything changes. Hal gets stuck in an elevator with self help guru Tony Robbins. Hal and Tony have a discussion. Tony is bothered by Hal's superficiality when it comes to women, and puts a spell of sorts of Hal. Hal is now able a woman's inner beauty. In his eyes, all women are beautiful. The problem is, in everyone's else's eyes, they're really not all that attractive. So when Jack meets the 300 pound plus Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit), he sees her as the typical stick thin blonde he's used to. Hal hits it off with her without ever knowing what she really looks like. As Mauricio becomes increasingly worried about his friend, Hal and Rosemary fall deeper in love. Until the spell is broken. Of course, by the end, everything wraps up in a preditable fashion, but it still works out.The film is every funny. I applaud Gwyneth changing her look for her role. Most actresses would balk at the idea, but Gwyneth is about showing off her acting talents rather than her looks (though she is a very beautiful women). Jack Black is very funny as Hal, and though as I said earlier he's trying shamelessly to revive his career, it was nice to have Jason Alexander along for the ride. Loaded with extras, this is a dvd that I would recommend to most people.",Shallow Hal
606396,"As an adult, I thought that scary movies were things of the past--Friday the 13th and Halloween from my youth,  but The Ring jumped from the screen and creeped me out.  Not more than five minutes into it, I had goosebumps and was checking behind me.Not only is this scary and creepy, it is also a psychological thriller and mystery movie.  It is actually intelligently written and directed--I think a rarity for the scary movie genre.The acting is believable and genuine, even the children and teens perform well and add to the climate of fear.The story takes a few twists and is unpredictable until the very end.  There are no lulls and no resting until the tv is turned off.  As one reviewer intimated, you will need to get religion to get this one out of your system.",N/A
84260,"Andrew Adamson is good at what he does best.  He can make adults and children laugh and cry at his whim.  Referring to the interview that he had given, he was brought up with the book and thus, he was adamant that the movie was to be as faithful to the book rendition as much as possible.  Some readers commented that it's not 100% accurate, well, to have the book been converted into a movie is by no mean an easy feat.  The stars of the show would definitely be those adorable children.  Special effects in this instance is second rank with some really shoddy resolution.  Then, there's the deja-vu with Lords of the Ring Trilogy and I can't blame them when you could see towards the end credits that costumes and weapons are derived from WETA (special effects wing of Peter Jackson's production company).  I think that a movie shall be enjoyed for what it is rather than this discussion about the Christianity element in it.  If that's the case, what's so wrong about it when Christianity is to preach people to do the moral things?  Ultimately, this movie is about the magic that we possessed when we were young and then, we lose it when we get older.  It's all about faith and hope in believing in the little children that is in all of us.  By the way, Tilda Swinton is absolutely superb and Liam Neeson's majestic voice is superb.  Highly recommended for family viewing.  It's overall a good movie but not a great one.  It shall be interesting to see if there is any sequel coming out of this one.",N/A

Ooops.  As many reviewers have so adroitly noted, if you're not a fan of the series, you probably won't get a lot out of this film.  While expertly done, FIGHT THE FUTURE has a lot of elements that one cannot fully appreciate if one wasn't involved in the series.  And that makes me wonder, what was the point of making a movie if only fans of the series could truly appreciate it?  Why didn't they just make a two hour t.v. movie?  Obviously, they were hoping to expand their market with this big screen version, but as box office receipts proved, the film did not make the beaucoups of money the producers had hoped to.  Nor did it make movie stars out of David Duchovny or Gillian Anderson.  I will admit however that the movie is not the least bit boring, just confusing.  The performances are professional and noteworthy, the music is neat, and it moves at a very intense pace.  However, for the simple movie goer and those who did not follow the series after this movie was released, it left a lot of open territory to explore.  A well made, interesting movie, but not enough to make me run out and buy the DVDs of the series.",N/A
932220,"""Cinderella Man"" follows the boxing career of James J. Braddock, whom the newspapers dubbed ""Cinderella Man"" when he rose from abject poverty to be World Heavyweight Championship in 1935, inspiring scores of fans who were also suffering the bane of the Great Depression. Braddock (Russell Crowe) led a comfortable middle-class life in New Jersey with wife Mae (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and their children, with a shot at the light heavyweight crown, when he lost his home and savings in the Crash of 1929 and then lost his career to injuries. Like so many Americans at the time, Jim and Mae couldn't feed their children or pay the heating bill. In 1934, a year after the Boxing Commission decommissioned him, manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) got Jim a chance to fight Corn Griffin for $250 when his opponent backed out at the last minute. No time to train. A one-shot deal. He was expected to lose. But it was Jim Braddock's only chance to earn a living, and it was the only chance he needed.Russell Crowe is a superb character actor who also has great presence, so he's perfect to play a star athlete. James Braddock was a modest and unassuming man, and this is a nice understated performance by Crowe. In contrast to a well-spoken, big personality like Captain Aubrey in ""Master and Commander"", Braddock's mindset is conveyed with few words and simple gestures. We see the contrasting personalities of Jim Braddock and arrogant, flamboyant Heavyweight Champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), who had proven himself a killer in the ring. Some of the film's most interesting scenes concern the anxieties and politics anticipating the Baer-Braddock Championship fight. And boxing fans will enjoy the fight scenes, which often place the camera in the ring.Braddock became a symbol of hope to thousands of disillusioned boxing fans and New Jersey natives: A hardworking, honest Everyman who had suffered great loss and triumphed. To reflect the demoralized American psyche of the Great Depression, the backdrop against which this story is told, the cinematography is on the dark side. Indoor scenes are often shot low-key, with very little light. But I never had the impression that there was not enough light in critical areas of the frame, as is too often the case when people try to use low-key lighting with color film. Really nice work by cinematographer Salvatore Totino.I feel I should mention Paul Giamatti's role as manger Joe Gould, because I don't normally like Giamatti. His characters tend to be whiney and neurotic. But Gould isn't that at all and really shows what Giamatti can do if he stays away from the misfit roles. Jim Braddock's granddaughter, actress Rosemarie DeWitt, plays the Braddocks' friend Sara Wilson in the film, by the way. ""Cinderella Man"" is a finely crafted biopic that successfully conveys the anguish of Braddock's hardships, his gratitude at getting a second chance, and the joy so many fans felt at his triumph, which makes it a successful sports film as well. Sometimes I come away from Director Ron Howard's films feeling that he is very good at some things, but depth of emotion isn't one of them. I didn't have that impression with ""Cinderella Man"". This film bears Ron Howard's straightforward narrative style, but its emotions are not showy or superficial.",N/A
499385,"Great cast, poorly used. Story is just so, so. Interesting premise, just never goes anywhere. The pulling together of the team, often one of the more entertaining aspects of these types of films, is just not that engaging, despite a good measure of the film being devoted to it. I have no issue with the premise of crafty older guys taking on the mission of this type. It's just that the craftiness isn't well demonstrated, rather they seem to plod through it. There are relationships between a number of the troop, but not very well developed. Action, once finally engaged, is just OK and often repetitious; how many times do you need to see bodies flying through the air as a result of a grenade blast.The double cross by the employer adds interest but their way out of that situation is not terribly inventive or entertaining either, again just more plodding. And there's not the underlying humor anywhere displayed that can often be had in these types of films. The film takes itself too seriously.Wanted it to be better. Could have been the Dirty Dozen of mercinary movies. Isn't!Interestingly, cover tries to promote Roger Moore as the principal star when it was really a Richard Burton film with Roger having a meaty supporting role.

103976,"Surviving war is the most challenging part of it. Whether it be surviving the physical and psychological rigors of war or it's sometimes nasty aftermath ""The Big Red One: The Reconstruction"" is one of the finest movies made about World War II. Fuller (""Shock Corridor"" among many other films)made a lot of exploitation films during his long varied career but it's clear that here Fuller had found his best story to tell.Lee Marvin gives a terrific performance (and one of the best of his career)as the leader of a group of young soldiers. Most of the cast does an exceptional job as well (particularly Robert Carradine essentially playing Fuller). The film has its minor flaws certainly (some of the performances are a bit stilted)but film critic Richard Schickel a long time admirer of Fuller and this film has done a marvelous job of restoring Fuller's masterpiece to its original projected length. Schickel used the original script, production notes and the memories of some of the production participants to help recreate the film Fuller intended to release in the first place.The new version runs two hours and forty two minutes with the first disc devoted to the film. The second disc has alternate scenes; ""Anatomy of a Scene"" looks at the film both before and after the restoration.

836785,"""Decoys"" is a little flick from our neighbors to the north.  It features a cast built up primarily of newcomers(at least to the U.S. audience)and some reasonably good special effects considering the budget.The story centers around St. John's College(filmed at University of Ottawa) where a good chunk of the male population has started to come up missing or frozen from the inside out.  No one knows what's happening to these guys until one curious male student stumbles upon a pair of sorority sister cousins with some interesting appendages.  They lack belly buttons but have another surprise waiting for the boys in their unusual birthmarks.  The story unfolds from there as the student, Luke Callahan, attempts to uncover the girls for what they really are and to find out why they are freezing any and every amorous boy that they can get their hands on.  Of course, our hero becomes a suspect in the case, lead by an eager Canadian cop played by the recognizable Richard Burgi and his sidekick, the lovely but never quite a star, Nicole Eggert.As stated before, the majority of this cast is comprised of newcomers excepting Burgi and Eggert.  Also, look out for the guy who plays ""Jay"" on ""Degrassi:  The Next Generation.""  Another little surprise was the coroner, played with tongue-firmly-in-cheek by veteran soap star Don Hastings.The FX are pretty good.  The creatures look good in close-ups, but you can tell when a CGI model is used pretty easily.The story isn't too terrible, but allow for the below-average acting and the sometimes hokey direction.  It's obvious that the director was trying to keep things reasonably light, as attested to in the ""Making Of"" documentary included on the DVD.  In other words, it seems like the cast and crew knew that this flick wasn't going to be a contender in the awards department, so they had fun making it.There is some nudity and a lot of sensuality, usually followed by some swift violence.  The language isn't too horrible.  As a matter of fact, if you cut out the few scenes with nudity, this film probably would have registered a PG-13 rating in the U.S.Recommended to fans of B-grade horror who know what they are getting into.",N/A

Poor Lonette is probably wondering why she doesn't get the plum parts she used to in such films as COTTON CLUB and MALCOLM X but she's got nothing to be ashamed about!  Her fans have never forgotten her crooning ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" in ROUND MIDNIGHT and we will never will!  What they should have done in HONEY is have a duet with Lonette McKee and Missy Elliott.Meanwhile Mekhi Phifer is adorable as the lovesick barber who clawed his way outta the gangs, and as for David Moscow (who plays Michael, the hyorndog viedo director), he was so cute in BIG and NEWSIES that we hope this turn towards sexual harassment is just a momentary aberration on his part.The final number, ""I Believe,"" is just as good as the climax ""I Sing The Body Electric"" in FAME.

872025,"Chappelle's Show became Comedy Central's breakthrough hit show in 2003, giving the network its hottest program to date.  Of course it would lead to the release of Season 1 on DVD and thusly lead to the biggest-selling DVD collection of a TV series in history with nearly 3 million copies sold and counting (currently beating out the Family Guy DVD collections).  So how do you match that?The answer is you follow up your hit season with an even bigger second season and that is what viewers get with Chappelle's Show Season 2: Uncensored.  The newest volume of the series contains all 13 episodes of the smashing 2nd season of Chappelle's Show, including the episodes and various sketches that have made the show explode into a cult phenomenon.The first of the classic episodes deals with Charlie Murphy (Eddie's brother) and his ""True Hollywood Stories"" involving funk superstar Rick James, who also appears in the story to seemingly corroborate (or at times disprove) Charlie's statements. Additionally, James is portrayed hilariously in flashbacks by Dave Chappelle and if you can't laugh at his performance you need a serious laughter transfusion.  As we all know this led to the creation of one of the most quoted, or paraphrased, phrases of last and this year: ""I'm Rick James, b---h!""Another episode is a second edition of ""THS"" that has Charlie meeting up with another funk legend, Prince (again played up for laughs in flashbacks by Chappelle),who along with his band The Revolution challenges Charlie and his friends to a basketball game after a listening party.  This is one of the funnest sketches of the entire 2nd season and worth getting the set.Several sketches over the series run have Dave playing the self-proclaimed ""King of Crunk"", Lil Jon and seemingly reducing the rapper/producer's vocabulary to the 3 most well-known words he says: Yeah!, What? and Okay!, and making him seem like a seriously intellingent man (which he is in real life)at times (so much so the real Lil Jon appears in one sketch).But without question the one episode the takes the prize in the collection is when Dave abruptly quits the show and is ultimately replaced by...Wayne Brady?!?!  The fact that Brady plays so far against the normally typecast ""goody-two-shoes"" way that he normally acts is a howler, especially when he says ""Does Wayne Brady need to choke a b---h around here?""  That line alone make the episode a classic.Unlike the Season 1 set which was made up of 2 discs, the Season 2 set has 3 discs, the episodes are on discs 1 and 2 including audio commentary from Dave and his partner/co-creator Neal Brennan on selected episodes, but the 3rd disc contains all the bonus features to include: an additional stand-up from Dave, over an hour of deleted/extended scenes and bloopers with commentary, an extended interview with Rick James, 2 unaired Charile Murphy stories, and more.  The one thing that might burn some viewers is that in the Rick James episode, a scene where two women show ""Rick"" (Dave) their breasts is still blurred in the episode.  Never fear though: The scene is located in the Deleted Scenes without blurring and (believe it or not) shows a rather unique way to use chocolate...:)This is definitely for those Chappelle's Show fans that loved the first season and need something to tide them over until the 3rd season FINALLY gets completed or just for those that always wonder why someone is consistently walking around saying ""I'm Rick James, b---h!"" and have no clue why.  This will definitely prove that some things are funner the second time around...",N/A

3114,"that NEVER should have suffered a remake. No need to go into the grim details, but if you want style, thrills and chills, see the 1946 version with George Brent, Dorothy McGuire and Ethel Barrymore and ignore the dreadful attempt to update a classic that needed no updating.This is the one that set the template for all horror movies that followed; the original from which all others flowed. The spooky music, which, in it's time, was as groundbreaking as the theme from Jaws. The classic 3 notes sent chills down my spine, and when I first saw this movie I was 7 years old and it really did scare the hell out of me. I watched it with my father and he loved it too; we had a Million Dollar Movie that played 5 nights for one week and we watched it every night.Ethel Barrymore is, as always, superb and lends the perfect touch to this spooky, suspenseful movie. George Brent is wonderful as the smooth soft-spoken professor, the head of the house, and the caretaker of the family. Dorothy McGuire conveys tremendous emotion given her muted state; she has, throughout most of the movie, not one word of dialogue but a world of emotions and you can tell what she's thinking and feeling.The setting is a New England town, circa 1890, and the house is a huge Victorian, very luxurious and beautifully furnished. The opening scene shows a group of people in a room in a hotel breathlessly watching ""The Kiss"", which was groundbreaking in it's time, because it showed the first kiss ever put on film and was quite shocking back then. The music for ""The Kiss"" consists of a woman playing the piano according to whatever mood is onscreen, and is perfect for the score for SS also.There is a serial killer on the loose; preying on women with handicaps/afflictions, which puts Dorothy McGuire, as Helen, in a very precarious situation and it is her safety we are concerned with. The house is populated with a disparate group, and one by one each is somehow removed in varying circumstances, leaving Helen vulnerable to an attack. To enhance the mood, there is a violent thunderstorm throughout the movie, and the lightning flashes occasionally reveal hidden dangers outside and inside (!) the house.So, for an appreciation of truly excellent moviemaking, (and ""thrills and chills"")see this gem, it is as scary today as it was in it's film debut back in 1946...",N/A

Possibly the very first buddy movie as well.Set on the Indian northwest frontier, the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevadas makes a perfect match for the place, and the steady hand of the director provides just the right touch of farce and high adventure. I can still hear the pipes as the Scottish troops march into the fanatics trap, and hear Gunga Din blowing the bugle to save the regiment.

576976,"I read where John Irving said recently that he always writes the end of his story first, and I have the feeling that writer-director Sara Sugarman did something along those lines with ""Very Annie Mary.""  That is because there is a great ending to this one, or at least a great climax (how much you will think of the denouement is debatable).  I know that part of it is being on emotional edge this week watching the news from New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, but I really think that Sugarman provides a transcendent ending to the story of Annie Mary Pugh (Rachel Griffiths), who lives in a town in Wales.  That explains why everybody speaks in a Welsh accent, not that we can imitate such the way we do an English, Irish or Scotch accent (ever notice in Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" that the comic relief is provided by four men: an Englishman, an Irishman, a Scott, and a Welshman; so that there are four different accents at play in their conversations).Annie Mary's father, Jack (Jonathan Pryce), runs the local bakery and not only likes to sing like Pavarotti over the speaker system of his truck as he makes his deliveries, he dresses up like the great tenor (including a mask).  Annie Mary used to sing too, and even won a contest 15 years ago that earned her a chance to study in Milan.  But then her mother died and Annie Mary has not sung since.  For reasons that only become clear if you think about it at the end, her father treats her abominably.  For her birthday he gives her a cabbage, and when he is cold he makes her curl around his feet.  Annie Mary has no luck with the boys in town, even though she offers to pay one for a kiss.  Her best friend is Bethan Bevan (Joanna Page), a bedridden 16-year-old who is quite ill.  It is only with Bethan that Annie Mary can watch the silent videotape of her and her mother 15 years ago when they were happy.  Meanwhile, the mayor wants to raise money to send Bethan to Disneyland and Annie Mary would like to help.Then her father suffers a stroke, and the responsibility for taking care of him and running the shop falls to Annie Mary.  Eventually she realizes that she has the upper hand now, and with a new sense of freedom she paints the kitchen a ghastly color and decides to join a local female pop group for a talent contest in Cardiff where there is a prize of 1000 pounds.  Is this a chance for redemption, a recipe for disaster, or both?  More importantly, will this be the point when Bethan (and the audience) finally get to hear Annie Mary sing?  Certainly she can do better than the weak Freddie Mercury imitation she attempts.  Then there is the question of the house that Annie Mary waves at when she walks by it.Annie Mary is an odd duck, but then most of the people in town are strange.  While this is entertaining, it really does not set up the big ending as well as it might if this was less of a comic-tragedy and more of an outright tragic tale.  After all, her father's actions towards her are truly despicable, and as a general rule I am not inclined to find that sort of abuse comic.  The low point that Annie Mary reaches makes her not only a sad figure, but rather pathetic, and some viewers may find that their reservoir of sympathy towards her has run out.  Certainly her few friends in town reach that point.  But such doubts about her character do not deter from the gloriously transcendent moment that Annie Mary achieves thanks to her one true friend.  Whatever problems there might be with the set up of the big moment, Sugarman and Griffith both deliver on that score.",Very Annie Mary

My expectations for this DVD were quite low (hopeful- but I was ready to be disappointed again). Well I was quite pleasantly surprised! This DVD is WAY better than Symphonic Yes!

946204,"This is a spoiler-free review of 'The Island'.'The Island' is a fun, fast-paced riff around the mid-1970s science fiction film 'Logan's Run'. The premises are almost identical - a group of people who believe they live in a seclused artificial 'paradise' for their own safety are actually being controlled by an Orwellian bureaucracy. This isn't a straightahead remake of the earlier film; instead director Michael Bay revisits aspects of the original movie and then introduces more contemporary ideas. I prefer movies that are 'inspired' by classic films to straightforward remakes,and 'The Island' is no exception.On the positive side is the chemistry between both Ewan McGregor and Scarlet Johannson. They're attractive leads who make a believable couple, and they nicely capture the naive essence of characters raised in seclusion all their lives. It's a pleasure to see a film where the romantic leads actually seem interested in one another, rather than being tossed together as the result of 'high concept' casting. There are also a few scattered scenes with Steve Buscemi, and fans of Buscemi's bug-eyed weasel persona are going to enjoy his too-brief appearance. The plot moves along nicely, and while much if it will be formulaic to almost any frequent movie-goer, it certainly works well most of the time.On the negative side - this is a Michael Bay movie. If you didn't like his over-the-top style, you won't like this. This includes some far-fetched stuntwork. And if you're hoping for a cerebral examination of the morality of cloning and related research, you'd better leave the theater and open an introductory biology textbook because this film sure isn't going to provide it.I go to the movies at least twice a month every summer, and 'The Island' is one of the best times I've had all year at the movies. It's a good, though not great, movie that you probably were discouraged from seeing from its awful advertising campaign. Give it a try, or rent it when it's on video. You just might be surprised at this one.",N/A
83753,"There is no denying this movie's technical and stylistic excellence, but Sin City is a pretentious film noir wannabe. It takes gratuitous violence to uninspired levels of depravity, and it pretends at a plot by interweaving multiple storylines and characters, all of which is too clever by half and amounts to a house of cards. This is a movie in which every male character is either a killer or a cop (sometimes both), and every female character is a Black Belt prostitute. Almost nothing makes sense, so you must watch the film as a pure sensory experience - albeit a very gruesome one. Some characters possess supernatural powers; we never discover why. I liked Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but even though Sin City adopted elements of those two films, I absolutely hated it. If viewing two hours of violence and torture is your idea of entertainment, then by all means, see this movie. If it is not, stay away. At best, you will feel bored; at worst, you will feel disgusted. This film creates a new genre: The Sadomasochistic Fantasy.",N/A

637856,"I realize Edgar Rice Burroughs' dopey King Kong story was written for  children & a young teen audience. I know it's supposed to be trite and two-dimensional! What I didn't expect was the blatant racism, the non-stop killing & gore, the pathological narcissism by one of the main characters, and the 1950's style monster movie drudgery, at the hands of an alleged genius, Mr. Jackson of Lord Of The Rings fame! I literally trusted that he would not pander to American society's lowest common denominator in order to make a buck.What a disappointment! I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when they did focus groups before making this movie. They must have impaneled a bunch of immature teenagers without any regard to either young children or grown-ups, which is a real shame!I was also a bit shocked by the disgusting racism shown towards a very dark skinned tribal community. It's now 2005, why were indigenous people portrayed as dangerous maniacs, and downright evil? This is a rather ugly stereotype the Western world has been carrying around for many centuries. To this very day, indigenous people are being run-off their land, or killed, because they stand in the way of the almighty dollar! Some situations are so extreme that organizations like Survival International from the United Kingdom, and Cultural Survival, out of Boston area, solely exist so this kind of mindless brutality will finally come to an end.This is a teachable moment. I hope Mr. Jackson makes amends for profiting off of a very White author's terribly misguided, and hateful, fantasies. Perhaps it's time to get Howard Zinn on the phone!The violence and gore caught me by surprise to the point it got rather tedious, and annoying! Besides being preposterous, for example, I don't care how strong a vine is, it's simply not going to hold onto a squirming, multiple ton dinosaur!  There was also a very disturbing message - that nature in its pristine wild state is, by design, an extremely dangerous place. Which, of course, needs to civilized by mostly White men!The attack of the giant cave bugs obviously reflects our childhood fears of the dark. But back in the real world most cave systems are occupied by some of the most unusually fragile endangered species on earth! Besides being fragile, they are blind, and totally harmless! How ironic! If this movie deters a single vandal from damaging an underground cave system, then hooray. But what most children, and plenty of older folks now will think is that caves are creepy, bad places instead of  biological treasure troves worthy of badly needed government protection!I could go on forever about why this film stinks. To sum it all up: The young child sitting behind me was constantly asking his father questions because he was trying to cope with the trash that was unfolding before his eyes. I had the good sense to walk out at the two hour mark. I dearly hope the boy's father had enough sense to do the same!",King Kong

He plays sizzling slide guitar on a terrific ""It Hurts Me Too"", and lets loose with a series of raw blues solos during Freddy King's ""I'm Tore Down"" and Eddie Boyd's ""Five Long Years"", and even pulls off a better-than-average ""Hoochie Coochie Man"".Eric Clapton's vocals are as good as I've ever heard him, and fans of his bluesier side should definitely pick up this fine concert video.

115566,"Gag me.  This is everything I hate in a musical.A family in the suburbs of St. Louis are living their life happily while their two eldest daughters, Rose and Esther, contemplate love and marriage.  The beginning sets off the tone nicely: ""How is this ketchup?"" ""Oh well it's too sweet...""  ""What do you think?""  ""Oh, much too flat.""  Indeed, the movie was nice enough to use its own device to describe what's wrong with it: sickly sweetness and flat tones.I haven't a problem with Technicolor or sweetness, but these people look like they're made out of marshmallow peeps and St. Louis looks like Candyland.  Even the muddy street looks edible!  Even when worries come up, there's never really any conflict, just a bunch of stretches to try to find a good way of fitting another song in; basic musical conceit, keep setting up songs and it's fun for the whole family.Now the singing is absolutely excellent, I'll give it that, but the music isn't particularly remarkable and the lyrics are terrible.  However, it's all in the name of good family entertainment.Honestly, if it wasn't for the singing and the relatively compelling character of Tootie, who despite her cutesy name and her cutesy image is something of a fledgling sadist, it'd be hard to really care about the plot...  wait a minute, plot?  You mean the thing where these characters  fall in love, then fear a move, then don't move, then just go back to being in love?  Oops, looks like we forgot something.Something else is a bit confusing about this movie... it's set in 1903... so why does nothing about it feel like 1903, at all?  It's so incredibly anachronistic it's appalling.  But see, we're not supposed to focus on any of these things, we're only suppost to feel happy and lovely that everything works out in the end, or something.  It's dated escapism; very little of it seems really appealing or even important theseadays.  I'm sure if you're looking  for a way to ""fall in love all over again"" or something, this could be a good movie to cosy down to, but then again, there's a lot better out there for just that same purpose.--PolarisDiB",N/A
45506,""" Which Way Is Up "" , has been , and still is one of the funniest movies , that I've seen. From the beginning to the end , it's just down right hilarious. I'm smiling right now , just thinking about certain scenes. The script isn't original , by any means...but Richard Pryor's comedic talents take this film to unprecedented heights of humor. During a period of 1970's film making , when stereotypical images of Blacks , were the norm , this film is highly likely to offend people who are desiring political correctness.However , if you're able to except this film , for what it is .....you'll soon find yourself laughing at every ludricrous scene. I think the genuine qualities, of this film , are that it doesn't try to be something it isn't. It also doesn't attmept to be over-the-top, ridiculous. It simply tells the story of Leroy Jones's ( a young man , who leads a life of stagnant impoverishment), relocation to the big city. Motivated by the prospects of new romance , more money , and the threat of being killed for unknowingly starting a worker's strike ( in his hometown)...Leroy moves.Early and dedicated perfomances by Leonette Mckee ( Sparkle , Jungle Fever , Malcom X , ect ) , Marilyn Coleman ( Menace 2 Society , Looking for Mr. Goodbar, ect. ), and Margaret Avery ( Color Purple ), give this film an inescapable sence of truth. Honestly , if it weren't for the cast's ability to play their characters with an honest sense of seriousness , this film wouldn't be so funny. But that's the key to "" Which Way Is Up"". And that's why it's still hilarious, today. I highly recommend it and it will remain one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen.The dvd doesn't offer anything , but the ability to skip and choose scenes . However , this film, captures Richard Pryor ( playing three different charactors ) during his comedic prime , and that's well worth the money you'll spend.",N/A
787878,"I was a little kid, probably younger then Junior when I first saw this movie. I never saw it as a PG rated movie, to me at the time it was kind of a naughty movie that somehow I was getting away with watching, almost being a mischievous kid myself by getting away with watching it. Now, I look back on it with fond memories and how I was probably influenced myself by these movie when I was in school. Tho none of us who where wild child's could say they drove a car through a store window, hung nuns out to fly, electrocuted the neighbours, torched there room, led a bear to the camp site, threw the birthday girls presents into the pool or drove heavy machinery into a wedding, we where guilty of a few things Junior and Trixie get up to in these movies. Junior may not be everybody's idea of a fun movie, but I saw him as the kind of kid that was doing what some kids where imagining, sure, there probably ex-cons by the 4th grade, but ya gotta have a sense of humour.The 2 movies are placed onto the one disc (same side). There are a few trailers to get through first, and then you have the option for part 1 or 2. Unfortunately there are not any bonus features. I know there are plenty of deleted scenes, you only have to see the trailer once to know that, and what I really would have liked is an audio commentary and a ""where are they now"" clip. I always wondered who the juniors in the beginning where? Where they related to the main actor, or where they look a likes at younger ages? And what ever happened to the kid who played Junior? Also, a bit about how Amy Yasbeck ( Flo Healy / Annie Young) met her husband , John Ritter(R.I.P) (Little Ben Healy) for the first time on the set of this very movie! Hopefully, one day they will make a special edition for Problem Child, but for now this will do. 2 of 3, and the best of the 2 one disc is a good deal. Both movies are equally funny, which proves the theory that sequels are never as good as the original, wrong!Problem Child 3 was a lame movie that shouldn't have been made, so take these two great movies for the kids, and maybe the adults might get a kick out of it, too!?",N/A

892810,"Nominated for only one Emmy, the entertainment quality of Silk Stalkings is nevertheless evidenced by its nine season run which is one of the most enduring ever for an original cable TV series. Partly responsible for this lack of critical acclaim is that Silk Stalkings was a trailblazer in the cable genre, and handing out Emmys to original cable series didn't become fashionable until the late-1990s when Sex And The City and The Sopranos broke the cable barrier for good. Another contributing factor to the lack of peer recognition is that Silk Stalkings lasted about four seasons longer than it should have, given that nearly the entire cast and crew were replaced after the first five seasons. Regardless, this hour-long drama series set in Palm Beach, Florida contains all the necessary ingredients for a hit show - beautiful people in a beautiful setting with lots of murder, violence, and intrigue. Silk Stalkings offers everything one could ask for in a TV drama, and the show's success helped pave the way for additional original cable series such as Monk and The Shield...Silk Stalkings follows the exploits of two Palm Beach, Florida detectives who investigate murders and other high profile crimes in an elite community which is no stranger to fame and fortune. Sgt. Chris Lorenzo (Rob Estes) and Sgt. Rita Lee Lance (Mitzi Kapture) are partners on the local Palm Beach Police Department, and each episode they must investigate one or more high-profile crimes. The dynamic relationship between Chris and Rita is a focal point of the show, and the two will overturn every stone and use every tactic at their disposal to bring justice to those who, either due to fame and/or wealth, believe they are above the laws that governor average people... Veteran entertainer Ben Vereen plays their boss, Capt. Hutchinson, in seasons one through three before being replaced by Charlie Brill (Capt. Harry Lipschitz) for the remainder of the series... Overall, Silk Stalkings is a finely scripted investigative drama cut from the same mold as Law & Order SVU...The Silk Stalkings (Season 3) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Crime of Love"" in which Rita becomes disillusioned when the parole board grants an early release to Tony Fielding, a convicted criminal apprehended by Rita several years earlier... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Love Never Dies"" in which the Palm Beach fashion community is rocked when a young model dies from a drug overdose, and ""The Scarlet Shadow"" in which Rita becomes the subject of an internal investigation when she's the last person to see one of her friends before that friend turns up murdered...Below is a list of episodes included on the Silk Stalkings (Season 3) DVD:Episode 44 (Crime of Love)Episode 45 (Team Spirit)Episode 46 (The Perfect Alibi)Episode 47 (To Serve and Protect)Episode 48 (Tough Love)Episode 49 (Sex, Lies, and Yellow Tape)Episode 50 (Schemes Like Old Times)Episode 51 (Love Never Dies)Episode 52 (Daddy Dearest)Episode 53 (Ladies Night Out)Episode 54 (The Party's Over)Episode 55 (Killer Cop)Episode 56 (T.K.O.)Episode 57 (Judas Kiss)Episode 58 (Love Bandit)Episode 59 (Whore Wars)Episode 60 (The Scarlet Shadow)Episode 61 (Head 'N' Tail)Episode 62 (Freudian Slip)Episode 63 (The Last Campaign)Episode 64 (The Deep End)Episode 65 (Mother Love)Episode 66 (Dark Heart)The DVD Report",Silk Stalkings - The Complete Third Season

858075,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a moving performance in ""Ladder 49,"" playing a Baltimore firefighter who goes from rookie to 10-year veteran in the course of the story.Although its chief selling point is its spectacular - but never hyperbolic - fire sequences, ""Ladder 49"" is actually at its most compelling when it focuses on the struggle firemen go through trying to balance their high risk occupation with their role as husband and father.In addition to Phoenix, who brings a self-effacing strength and heroism to his character, there are fine performances by John Travolta as the captain of the station, and Jacinda Barrett as Phoenix's understanding but understandably concerned wife.In the first half of the film, the screenplay threatens to erupt into a raging inferno of stereotypes and cliches, as the characters take an occasional time out from firefighting for puppy love romance at the supermarket, frat boy antics at the fire station and domestic squabbles involving neglected wives and children at the old homestead.  But about halfway through the film, the deeper themes rise to the surface and ""Ladder 49"" begins to explore complex issues in a mature way.

Listen, for example, as to how the composer treats several disperate scenes with his bittersweet 'Americana'-imbued score [influences of Copland (naturally), Gershwin, and the second-movement of Elliott Carter's First Symphony (1942), the latter of which was known to Friedhofer].If this great score does not move you, then absolutely nothing will.

621879,"After I watched this movie I felt empty, lifeless, boring.  Then I remembered this was made in Hollywood.  Duh!  Here's the script:  The movie is about people in quirky New England.  You watch them live their lives.  Everything seems sort of normal in the beginning.  There are marital problems between Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger, but it seems like they are handling it maturely.  Insert here a college boy (hollywood suggests this fellow is your average college duude) to act as our sort of, on-camera witness to this family.  As the movie unfolds, you realize Jeff and Kim do not behave like normal people do.  Finally you find out why they are all screwed up.  And then it ends.  I guess in Hollywood, its OK to be sociopathic if you have a troubled past.  Hollywood rationalizes self-destructive behavior.  So what else is new?Don't try to figure out the door in the floor or what kind of publisher would call ""that"" a childrens story.  There is tragedy in the lives of these rich people and they have difficulty with day to day life.  The way they cope is both humorous and tragic.  Watch this movie for the lighter side.  See it to enjoy attractive naked people (sans Jeff Bridges).  Tom Cruises' ex, Mimi Rogers, bares it all.  Kim, just about all.  Both are still in great shape.  Laugh at the silly situations these addled rich people get themselves into.  Find humor in the college dudes doofusness.That's all your going to get, though, sporadic chortles.  Its a souped-up reality TV show. You get to watch people do stupid things (see Jackass, the Movie), but you don't learn anything.  Except how to wallow in your own misery... with panache.  I gave it three stars because the actors really gave it a good effort, in spite of a pretty weak storyline.I got teased into the DVD because of the cover.  Ebert gave it two thumbs up.  Basinger (?) and Bridges got good acting reviews.  Interesting tag line.  Though the writer and director may think otherwise, this movie is like King Kong or Lord of the Rings; nothing more than a hollywood fantasy without special effects - though they may have done a little airbrushing on Kim.",N/A

Previous reviewers have already analyzed the plot, etc., but I was impressed with Bill Condon's direction and especially his Screenplay (he was nominated by the Writers' Guild; also won the Oscar for writing the wonderful ""Gods & Monsters""). This is an ""indie"" but I never would've realized that. The photography by Frederick Elmes was exquisite; period detail was completely caught by costumer Bruce Finlayson and set designer Richard Sherman. Especially impressive was the editing by Virginia Katz, keeping the narrative frantic, or calm & sweet, as necessary. Liam Neeson was perfect, as was Laura Linney as his wife. Excellent chemistry. Also were excellent performances from Peter Sarsgaard, Chris O'Donnell, Timothy Hutton, John Lithgow, Oliver Platt & Tim Curry (as a prude?). Two performances really blew me away: William Sadler as the ultimate sex-offender was so subtle and natural in his delivery that it was unsettling. Also, at the very end, a stunning and beautifully created cameo from Lynn Redgrave, giving Mr. Kinsey a sense of renewal. It's very hard for me to believe that there are people out there who don't realize that Mr. Kinsey meant well.

734148,"Two things must be known by the viewer before they see this movie in order for them not to be disappointed. One, this doesn't take a very realistic approach to the cryptozoological creature known as Bigfoot or Sasquatch (for those who believe in it, anyway). And two, this is a typical low-end monster flick that was never meant to be any kind of masterpiece, but rather an accomplice to popcorn and a lonely weekday's night.The story isn't a very complex one. Lance Henriksen and his little expedition group have traveled up in the snowy mountains in an attempt to find his daughter, whose plane crashed there and no one knows what had happened (or even if they survived). Also there (for the greedy part of the gang), lost in the mountains, is a nifty little device that, once they recover it, may hold the proof of Sasquatch's existence. As it turns out, it does. (Since the movie is nothing of a genius plot, I'm about to spoil the story a little bit) A family member of Sasquatch was killed by the plane as it crashed to the ground. If that didn't piss him off enough, there's that stinkin' box-like device that can prove his existence. So, he chases and tries to slaughter Henriksen's team, wanting to make sure that box doesn't leave his woods (yeah, it's getting a bit silly, isn't it?). By the end of the movie, Henriksen faces off with the beast (the others have left, but he insisted on staying behind and killing the monster). I won't spoil the very end for you, but trust me, it's just as silly and full of plot-holes as the rest of the film.Sasquatch certainly fails to present an interesting or scary monster flick. On the other hand, there are plenty of nights when boredom is your only company that it could very possibly entertain you. One highlight of the film is the fact that there is little to no CGI used for the creature. The suit isn't all that pathetic, either. They did make a wise choice by showing as little of the monster as they could, since it wasn't a very believeable costume if given a closer and clearer inspection. In short, the only reason to see Sasquatch is if you're bored and have that craving for a hairy monster stalking people in the woods. And for that, it's pretty enjoyable.",N/A

597961,"Some movies are just so beautifully filmed that one can watch the movie over and over despite a lack of plot or good story.  ""Road to Perdition"" is the rare example of a movie that has a compelling story with excellent cinematography.  The story in ""Road"" has been told several times in several different cultures.  There is nothing new with a gangster film with the traditional cat and mouse chase thrown in.  The movie opens and closes with scenes that have an overabundance of light, while everything in between is shrouded in darkness.  Some directors seem to want to fill every available film space with music or sound tracks.  Director Mendes does not fall into this clich&eacute; however.  Two scenes come to mind where Mendes uses the lack of music or sound to great effect.  One is towards the end of the movie where Hanks' character guns down the remaining members of Rooney's thugs.  Instead of hearing the shrill sound of several Tommy Guns go off at the same time, we instead see foggy gangsters falling one after another with no sound whatsoever except for Newman's haunting score.  When Sullivan finally guns down Newman's Rooney, we do hear these shots thereby making this killing all the more chilling.  The second example is at the very end of the movie where Jude Law's Maguire character faces off with the Sullivans in the cottage by the lake.  The average director may pack this tension filled scene with nervous instrumentation.  Instead, Mendes gives us no music, but just the sounds of the waves crashing on the Lake Michigan shore.  This silence heightens the tension rather then downplaying it.  ""Road to Perdition"" came out during the middle of the summer when the average movie consisted of action movies having large budgets and even larger explosions.  ""Road"" did fairly well at the box office with Tom Hanks/Paul Newman's star power but many people who came to see this intelligent movie were probably tired of brainless action movies.  It would be good if Hollywood turned out a movie like this every once in a while, during the summer, to appeal to the viewer that may be tired of movies that the Jerry Bruckheimer cookie cutter machine cranks out.  Just one caveat: you should not look to ""Road"" as a gangster movie in the same vein as ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas.""  Instead, it is a simple father-son movie disguised as a gangster flick.  This father-son motif is evident in many movies but is disguised many ways.  ""Field of Dreams"" had this motif as a baseball movie, while ""Star Wars"" couched the motif in the middle of intergalactic warfare.  Much praise should be given to Thomas Newman's beautiful score in the film as well.  Overall, ""Road to Perdition"" is probably Mendes most underrated work, while `American Beauty' stands out as his most `overrated.'",N/A
975577,"Felicity Huffman plays desperate housewife Lynette Scavo on the popular TV miniseries DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, which, though occasionally immensely entertaining, is also Desperately Silly. In TRANSAMERICA, Huffman has a Big Screen gig that should indisputably prove that she's an actress of considerable ability. The other desperate housewives, actresses Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, and Nicolette Sheridan, can only stand back and envy.Here, Huffman is Bree Osbourne, born Stanley, a California man on the verge of the very last stage of his transgender transference, i.e. genital surgery that will, as he puts it, convert his ""outey"" to an ""inney"". In every other way, Stanley/Bree already presents to society as a female. What has otherwise been a relatively smooth transition hits a bump when Bree discovers, and must bail out of a New York City jail, his 17-year old transient son, Toby (Kevin Zegers), conceived in a long-ago liaison with a since-deceased girlfriend. Bree's problem is how to get Toby back to the Golden State without revealing to the teenager their biological relationship and the former's genetic gender. What's a poor girl to do?When the creators were sitting around the table discussing casting for this clever film, there had to have been some argument. Do they find a man to play a man morphing to a woman, or a woman to play a man morphing to a woman? Their choice of Huffman was inspired, and it pays off brilliantly. This is perhaps not surprising as the excellent actor William H. Macy is the movie's producer (and, also, Huffman's real-life hubby). Indeed, Felicity's performance is eminently Oscar-worthy, and will be a definite eye-opener to audiences that are only familiar with her DH persona. Also notable in brief supporting roles are Graham Greene as the Navaho rancher, Calvin Manygoats, who gives Bree and Toby a ride after their car is stolen in New Mexico, and Fionnula Flanagan as Bree's distraught and resentful Jewish mother.On the surface, TRANSAMERICA is a four-star, insightful, poignant, and amusing look at the practical problems associated with transgender transition.

Sleepy Hollow takes place in 1799 in the village town of Tarrytown, New York upon the heels of the turn of the century, and Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), an eccentric investigator, is responsible for restoring the town's peace from the Headless Horseman.  Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is the daughter of the head townsman who has ties to the supernatural, and takes a liking to Ichabod.The film itself is amazing.  Burton adds a gothic dimension to Irving's tale and captures the gothic aspect of the story with a dark, foggy, and gory exhibition that is displayed with the characters, costumes and props in the film.  The cinematography is exceptional as well as Burton's teaming with Danny Elfman for the film's score.  The film has an array of horrific scenes of bloody gore, but the most interesting one is the scene where Ichabod takes jabs at a creepy tree with an axe that splashes out blood.  He discovers a most gruesome discovery as he digs deep within the tree, which will make you leap out of your pants.  Sleepy Hollow possesses the Burton traits that many will identify with:  Gray skies and dark nights that resonate doom and gloom and sunless snowy endings, and tinges of dysfunction within the family.  For example, Ichabod Crane is an investigator, but in his own life, he has unending nightmares of his loving mother and his monster-like father lurking in the background.Sleepy Hollow will frighten anyone who is looking for a horror film during a Halloween night or anytime of the year.  However, this is not a film for small children, and I recommend Disney's version of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.""  Nevertheless, Burton captures the Halloween spirit with much precision.  This quirky and scary horror flick will not disappoint those looking for the macabre in a film.",N/A

The premise is ripped off from Citizen Kane (detectivey-person must talk to surviving loved ones to find out a Big Secret about the Big Man), and it takes forever, goes off down a million side roads that are never resolved or resolved with a big thud. This Beethoven isn't a likable guy--unlike the film character of Amadeus, who was a spoiled brat but still kind of fun and sympathetic, Beethoven is a self-centered, sadistic monster, plain and simple. A single redeeming quality in him--or anyone--would have carried this film a long way. The Ode to Joy at the end is very well done, and the only reason I bumped this film up to 2 stars.",N/A
208197,"Director Walter Hill has decided to revisit his movie and altered it slightly so that it closer resembles his original comic book vision. His new tweaks to the movie are obvious right from the get-go as he narrates an opening scrawl featuring parallels to some nonsense about what we are about to see with a Greek myth. Some of the scene transitions are now done in a more overt, comic book style a la panels featuring stylized frames from the movie. It doesn't look too bad but is unnecessary and does tend to upset the rhythm of the film somewhat.The Warriors is set almost entirely at night and presents the city as a dark, foreboding labyrinth fraught with danger that lurks around every corner, much like what Escape From New York would capitalize on for an even greater effect. Even though Hill claims this to be a comic book-like film, it really doesn't feel or look like one despite his recent tinkering. The gritty setting, the ominous music and the constant danger that our heroes are in doesn't evoke a comic book vibe at all. And this is what fans of the film like about it.""The Warriors: The Beginning"" examines the film's origins. This featurette also takes a look at the casting process including an amusing anecdote that James Remar tells of how he got the role of Ajax.""The Warriors: Battleground"" examines the filming process. They shot mostly at night and on location in New York City. It was a tough one as principal photography took place during the summer with short nights and in rough neighbourhoods.""The Warriors: The Way Home"" explores how the encounters with various gangs, like the Baseball Furies, was done.

955327,"Ralph Fiennes stars as Justin Quayle in ""The Constant Gardener,"" a film based on the novel of the same name by John Le Carr&eacute;.  Fiennes is a diplomat with the British High Commission who meets Tessa, played by Rachel Weisz, when she publicly rails against a speech he has just delivered. Justin and Tessa have completely opposite temperaments. He is undemonstrative and introspective; she is passionate and outspoken.  Still, they fall in love and end up traveling to Kenya as man and wife.In Kenya, Rachel spends a great deal of time with a man whom she grows to admire greatly, a black doctor named Arnold Bluhm.  Much to their horror, Rachel and Arnold uncover a conspiracy that endangers the African people for whom they care so much.  Heedless of their personal safety, the two crusaders plan to reveal what they have discovered.  Before they get their chance, they are brutally murdered and a false cover story is circulated to explain the crime.  Justin Quayle has a choice to make.  Should he go back to his quiet existence in England and try to move on with his life?  Or should he conduct his own investigation into Tessa's death?Ralph Fiennes is an exceptionally expressive actor whose face reveals, during different scenes in the film, hurt, jealousy, grief, and rage.  Rachel Weisz's Tessa is a beautiful and sensitive woman who wears her heart on her sleeve.  She never holds back when she sees injustice, and she refuses to puts her personal safety ahead of her concern for others.  In smaller roles, Hubert Kound&eacute; exudes warmth as the compassionate Dr. Arnold Bluhm, Danny Huston is effectively slimy as two-faced Sandy Woodrow, a colleague of Justin's with his own agenda, and Bill Nighy is a chilling Sir Bernard Pellegrin, a man whom it is most unwise to cross.Credit goes to the director, Fernando Meirelles, and the cinematographer, C&eacute;sar Charlone, for the sweeping shots of Africa, with screeching flocks of birds wheeling towards an endless sky.  The scenes featuring hundreds of Kenyans, with their colorful garb, melodious voices, beautiful smiles, and heartbreaking suffering, are intensely moving.  Alberto Iglesias's haunting background score is by turns dramatic and poignant, and it adds immeasurably to film's atmosphere.I did have some problems with ""The Constant Gardener.""  Much of the dialogue is mumbled and difficult to make out, some of the scenes are choppily cut, the hand-held camera work is headache inducing, and the villains are a bit too one-dimensional.  Even with these flaws, however, the film is extremely effective, and it leaves the viewer with deep feelings of revulsion towards the many venal individuals who routinely exploit vulnerable human beings for personal gain.  The transformation of Ralph Fiennes from a proper and well-mannered man who never makes waves to a firebrand who is anxious to ""finish what [his wife] started"" is in itself worth the price of admission.",N/A
259208,"If you go into THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY with the idea that you will learn anything factual about Michelangelo, Pope Julius II, the Sistine Chapel, and Renaissance Rome--much less art--you are in for a rude awakening.  Historians were quick to point out that the film was even less historically accurate than the Irving Stone bestseller on which it was based.  Film critics were also harsh: while they described the film as competent, by and large they felt that a movie so crammed with notable talents should have been quite a bit better than it actually was.There is some truth to these accusations.  As a whole, THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY is essentially a prettified and cleaned-up 1965 idea of the characters and story it offers.  Even the alleys are well-swept and the servant drudges remarkably clean, and in terms of visuals and designs the film is nothing so much than THE SOUND OF MUSIC gone Italian.  The dialogue is remarkably pretentious and the plot extremely repetitive.  And certainly neither Charleton Heston nor Rex Harrison were anything like Michelangelo or Pope Julius II.Even so, the film works unexpectedly well on its own merits.  Heston and Harrison may be incredibly miscast, but they both play with considerable conviction, and their clashing styles lend surprising believability to their scenes together.  While a more accurate portrait of the era would be more interesting, one can't complain about the entertainment value involved; there is always something to see on the screen.  And although director Carol Reed and writer Philip Dunne play fast and loose with the facts, the story they offer is quite entertaining.This is not a great masterpiece of cinema, but it is a lot of fun to watch--as long as you don't take it too seriously as either history or art.  The bonus package is quite slight, but the restoration is very nice, and the film comes with the original and interesting documentary on Michelangelo's works that prefaced it when it was in theatrical release.  While I would not place this on a short of list of films to own, it is a pleasant enough way to spend a rainy night, particularly if you are looking for a film the entire family can watch together.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",N/A

634099,"John Lasseter must be really worried about now.  Pixar has had a straight run of 6 for 6 hits. That 'Cars' has been pushed back to next year may point to problems - although with their high standards and willingness to go back to the storyboard, I'm not worried.  However, Robots is the first film to truly compete with Pixar's output in both visual and script terms.Dreamworks had Shrek and its sequel (which were pretty good) and then disappointed terribly with the appauling Shark Tale - visually their next (Madagascar) looks undercooked.  Even Pixar's weakest (arguably A Bugs Life) is still excellent (and beat Dreamworks Antz on all levels).By these standards Fox looked like a rank outsider.  Ice Age was good but pretty fogettable and didn't rival any of the other studios on design while the story smelled a little too much like that of Monsters Inc.  This all has lead to Robots being the biggest animated surprise in a good few years.  We all knew that The Incredibles would be good - Robots hits you right between the eyes when you're not looking!The design is fantastic and beautifully rendered.  Its entire universe has been created from the imagination and is stunning.  Robot City is a vista that takes away the breath!Also taking away the breath are the numerous expertly handled set-pieces.  The city's pubic transportation system gives us our best moments with a staggeringly intricate journey from the station to BigWeld Industries.  Also amazing are the domino sequence and the genuinely exciting climax. Another particular favourite moment of mine was the fight over a foot that ends up as a wonderfully choreographed ballet.The voice talent is uniformly good. Robin Williams obviously steals the show but, since his character is pretty incidental, isn't allowed to upstage the action.The script is tight and works on all levels - from in-jokes to fart gags - with a good message that isn't rammed down the audiences' throats.

Joaquin Phoenix in one of his best performances plays firefighter Jack Morrison who we first meet trapped in a pyrotechnical nightmare.  Via flashbacks, we trace Jack through his first day on the job through his current predicament.  Phoenix gives Jack a heroic foundation but also shows us his own doubts, his love for his job and his family.  John Travolta pulls his weight in a subtler performance as the fire chief, Mike Kennedy, who shows a real love for his firefighters and a sense of humor to boot.  Jacinda Barrett does a credible job as Morrison's wife, Linda, who professes the expected worry over Jack's dangerous profession, but also lets him know how proud she is of him, and she's behind him all the way.  Baltazar Getty, Robert Patrick, Tim Guinee, Billy Burke and Morris Chesnut are especially good in their supporting roles.  The special effects are seamless and some of the best since BACKDRAFT.  Director Jay Russell focuses on the character's heroics and although the end is predictable, it still packs a wallop.

875585,"Keeping in mind that this is a made for television mini-series, DAY OF DESTRUCTION is good entertainment.  While burdened with derivative characters and mediocre acting, the movie sustains interest as the above average effects (for tv of course) carry the weight of the film.  The concept of such a powerful storm hitting a major city like Chicago is well thought out and its ramifications devastating.  Dianne Wiest does well in her role as as congresswoman who is trying to get legislation passed regarding important environmental issues.  Nancy McKeon from tv's FACTS OF LIFE offers a sincere enthusiastic performance in her role as a tv anchorwoman, and Randy Quaid seems to be having fun playing Tornado Tommy, a stormchaser who is enthralled with the force of the storms.  Thomas Gibson is wooden in a leading role, but Ari Cohen as the whistleblower and Andrew Jackson as McKeon's boss redeem themselves noteably.

674816,"One word: WOW!  After I got my ""Ultimate 3D Collection"" assortment (which also included ""Alien Adventure"" and ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"" IMAX DVDs), the first movie I had to see was ""Haunted Castle"", since I love to go ghost investigating when I can get the free time and people to join me.  Sure, the movie doesn't even comes close to anything realistic in the field of paranormal investigation, but as a 3D CGI fun ride, it's awesome.  I can see that it would be quite boring in 2D, but I watched it with the accompanying Razor 3D shutter glasses (put out by edimensional) and was totally blown away.  Got my mother to sit in and enjoy the film as well.  We were both loving the dimensional effects, and more importantly, the fantastic music.  If it wasn't for ""Haunted Castle,"" I would never have known about ""Lunascape"".  Can't wait to get their ""Reminiscence"" album, which has the ""Lane Navachi"" song from this movie on it.  ""Arid"" is also excellent in the movie, though ""Little Things of Venom"" is really the only good song from their album ""At The Close Of Every Day"".  As for the CGI in the movie, it kind of reminds me of the first two ""Myst"" games for computers.  Really, the only thing that dates it is the globular effect used for when the three knights melt at the beginning of the film.  Everything else is still excellent.  My only complaint would be that the roller coaster segment doesn't go fast enough and wasn't more like the CGI ""Devil's Mine Ride"" short film (which can be found on the ""Computer Animation Festival 2.0"" video, if you can find a copy).

622711,"Over the past decade, Ben Stiller has displayed a propensity for producing blockbuster comedies, and Along Came Polly is a fun and enjoyable comedy. Although not on the hilarity level of There's Something About Mary, Meet The Parents, or Zoolander - Along Came Polly is nonetheless a funny film (and it's certainly better than the horrid Duplex fiasco with Drew Barrymore). Ben Stiller again plays the role of the nice guy, but this time with a neurotic twist. As a result, the audience still likes his character, just perhaps not as much as some of Stiller's previous roles. But with some hilarious comedy sequences and good one-liners, Along Came Polly manages to keep its viewers entertained quite nicely...Ben Stiller plays the role of Reuben Feffer, an insurance man who avoids risk in every aspect of his life. Measuring everything from the probability of falling through a sidewalk grate to the odds of a piano falling on one's head, he calculates every decision he makes. Following his wedding to Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing), Reuben is devastated when (avoiding the risk of scuba diving), he catches his new bride having an affair with a scuba instructor on their honeymoon. Forced to reevaluate his life, Reuben determines that he needs to take on more risk in his life.With the help of his friend Sandy, Reuben gets out into the public arena once again, where he runs into former junior high school classmate Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston). Polly is the exact opposite of Reuben in almost every way, and he decides to pursue her so as to have more fun in his life. Everything goes well until Lisa returns hoping to win Reuben back, and Polly discovers that Reuben ran a risk analysis on their relationship, determining that Polly was a good risk to take. Now Reuben must decide what to do with his life...Jennifer Aniston, in her role as Polly Prince, turns in another great performance as a leading character's girlfriend (Office Space and Bruce Almighty). Playing a character whose attitude, demeanor, and life are the total opposite of Stiller's, the two Hollywood mainstays are able to save an otherwise adequately written screenplay. Some of the more hilarious scenes involve Reuben's has-been actor friend Sandy Lyle (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who continues to live off of his short-lived fame as ""the kid with the bagpipes"" in a 1980's movie similar to The Breakfast Club. In one scene, Sandy also ""sharts"" (a fart that's a little bit more than a fart), forcing Reuben to leave a party prematurely.Overall, Along Came Polly is a fun and entertaining film that's well worth the time spent. Although Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston have both made better films, it does have its high points. Movie-goers will find this to be a good, light-hearted romantic comedy with Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller stealing the show. Because of its headline talent and some good one-liners, Along Came Polly makes the cut as a highly recommended, must-see movie...The DVD Report",N/A

Not to mention that the film is more dated than ever, is chock full of almost non-existant and wooden acting, and a horribly executed take on the slasher killer.  The blood in the film is almost non-existant, which isn't such a bad thing considering director Armand Mastroianni was trying to go for a ""less is more"" angle, but He Knows You're Alone is one of those rare cases where more would probably have been better.

Whether you want to see Hanks in the beginning of his career, or you want a nostalgia trip down the 80's slasher road, He Knows You're Alone isn't utterly horrible and is worth a look if you've never seen it, but with so many superior films of the genre out there, your better off with something else.

897556,"This is an audacious, surprisingly amusing piece of Hollywood filmmaking by a veteran craftsman of the first magnitude, yet for a number of reasons, not necessarily of Martin Scorsese's sole doing, the movie does not resonate as much as you wish it would. In staying true to the spirit of multimillionaire magnate Howard Hughes between the late 1920's and the late 40's, Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan are stuck with the facts as they happened, and consequently, the film feels episodic with a great, sometimes dazzling story in the first 2/3 of its epic 166-minute running time and a pedantic, only occasionally involving last hour.You need to have some familiarity with Hughes' life to understand his halcyon years proving himself as a Hollywood tycoon worthy of respect, and his legendary excess during the three-year production of the now-forgotten ""Hell's Angels"" is captured perfectly here with truly thrilling aviation sequences. Scorsese then focuses on Hughes' romance with Katharine Hepburn and captures the oddball chemistry of burgeoning eccentrics amid the frenzied environment of studio-owned Hollywood, in particular, the Cocoanut Grove nightclub. These sequences remind me a lot of Scorsese's failed musical, ""New York, New York"", but this time he seems far more assured. Ava Gardner enters the picture in the forties, as Hughes builds luxury airplanes that can't fly and his obsessions and paranoia start to take over. There's a magnificently filmed sequence of Hughes crashing his XF-11 plane in the middle of Beverly Hills.Once he recovers from this incident, the film starts to drag, as the story shifts focus to the power struggles in positioning Hughes' airline TWA against the European-route monopoly of Pan Am and the machinations of Pan Am CEO Juan Trippe and the corrupt Maine senator Owen Brewster who investigates Hughes' WWII government contracts. Even the legendary mini-flight of the Spruce Goose fails to excite this late in the story. Only Scorsese's famous ""Taxi Driver""-like, mind-bending touch brings off the surrealism of the sequences where Hughes locks himself up in his room. The film ends rather anticlimactically with Hughes' successful 1947 appearance before Brewster's committee before he drowns in his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).Leonardo DiCaprio's chief asset as an actor is his intensity of purpose, and as Hughes, he has plenty of opportunities to display this attribute with his character's obsessions with aviation, moviemaking, glamorous movie stars and ultimately germs. What he is missing is a level of gravitas that would have made his character's increasing eccentricities more bearable to watch. Even though the reed-thin Texas-tinged voice is accurate, there is something perpetually juvenile about DiCaprio's appearance regardless of the twenty-year span of the story. This unfortunately compromises the chemistry between him and the obviously more mature Cate Blanchett, who initially seems to be crossing the border into parody as Hepburn. She displays the familiar brusque manner without caution and even affects the recognizable voice but with an inaccurate throatiness that belies the legendary actress' high, fluttery pitch at the time. Nevertheless, she eventually finds her grounding, especially as she recognizes their too-similar personalities and softens during the Hepburn family gathering scene.With less to do, the too-patrician Kate Beckinsale is in over her head as Ava Gardner, unable to convey the real actress' palpable sultriness or predatory voraciousness without posturing. On the other hand, Alec Baldwin is becoming a stronger character actor with every new film, and he plays Trippe with disquieting authority. John C. Reilly plays assistant Noah Dietrich in his typically hangdog fashion as he subsists more in the shadows. Alan Alda plays Brewster with Hawkeye's familiar mannerisms unafraid to show the underlying sliminess of his character. All the externals are impressive - Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing (the pacing never drags...just the story), Robert Richardson's cinematography, Dante Ferretti's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes. Yet for all of this, the movie falls short as a masterwork in Scorsese's filmography. This is a film to respect and not to love.The first disc has an excellent commentary track by Scorsese, Schoonover and producer Michael Mann - all full of insights without being pedantic. The number of extras on the second disc of the two-DVD set is staggering, really too much for anyone except for those deeply interested in Hughes. There is one deleted scene and twelve separate featurettes and documentaries covering everything from the production to Hughes' role in aviation to OCD to the music. Beyond the sheer number, my complaint about the set is that it's hard to maneuver around the decidedly viewer-unfriendly menus.",N/A
382904,"`Radio Days', written, directed and narrated by Woody Allen might be thought of as Allen's doing Jean Shepherd. The comparisons between this movie and Shepherd's `A Christmas Story' and his RADIO commentary is strong. The irony is that while Allen is going for nostalgia and comedy here, Shepherd, according to a lecture I saw him give about two years before his death, is actually going for satire. That is, while the notes in the `Radio Days' insert says that many of the episodes in the movie actually happened to Allen in Rockaway, Long Island, Shepherd's parents were entirely different from his fictional family living in Hammond, Indiana.I still remember with glee the opening of `Radio Days' coinciding roughly with the movie `Brighton Beach Memoirs' by the immensely well reputed comedy writer, Neal Simon. And, `Radio Days' got the better reviews. It's been a long time since I saw `Brighton Beach Memoirs', but I will offer the memory that Allen bests Simon by a long shot.As in most Allen movies, a great little game is to find all the cameo performers, and this one has more than it is share. The roster of guest appearances is filled to overflowing with the appearance of many semi-famous radio personalities such as Kitty Carlyle Hart, playing herself, without credit as far as I can see. Allen's stock company is here in force, headed by Mia Farrow, Julie Kavner, Tony Roberts, Wallace Shawn, and Dianne Wiest. Visitors to this stock company are Josh Mostel and Danny Aiello (after a recent especially strong appearance in `The Purple Rose of Cairo'). Most subtle are the appearances of Kenneth Mars as a heavily bearded rabbi and the very talented William H. Macy, whose role is so small, I don't even remember seeing him, much less recognizing him on the screen. The biggest casting surprise is a very brief appearance by Diane Keaton as a big band vocalist who has no lines except for the song she sings in the last scene.The action covers roughly six years, from the summer of 1938 (the year of Orson Wells' `War of the Worlds' Halloween broadcast) to New Year's Eve of 1944 and deals largely with the adult narrator's extended conservative Jewish family of mother, father, married aunt and uncle, unmarried aunt, and a pair of grandparents, all living in a rather large house between the waterfront and the business district of Rockaway, Long Island. There are a few asides to the Mia Farrow role who begins as a wannabe actress / cigarette girl who, in this six year period, achieves success in, you guessed it, radio.At the time of the action in the movie, the narrator appears as an eleven-year-old grade school boy who lusts after a Captain Midnight secret compartment ring. The parallel with Shepherd's `A Christmas Story' is strengthened by the analogy of this ring and Shepherd's Red Ryder BB gun. There are also strong connections to Shepherd's frequent references to the Little Orphan Annie secret decoder ring.This movie is fueled almost entirely by nostalgia, real and imagined, for adolescence and the radio. There seem to be fewer quick gags than even the relatively serious `Crimes and Misdemeanors' and the previous work, `Hannah and Her Sisters'.Parents are a recurring theme in many of Allen's movies, the most prominent being their appearance in interviews in `Annie Hall'. I often wonder if Allen was actually treated as poorly by his parents as he seems to depict in the many brief allusions in his movies. As this film is all about growing up with parents, it is perhaps the strongest essay on the subject, and the little boy character is either smacked or spanked at least five times in this movie by his parents. I have a very strong suspicion that much of this is done for dramatic effect and does not reflect an `Unhappy Childhood' for Allen, but it does make me curious.In spite of the fact that this is an excellent movie, on a par with `A Christmas Story' and superior to `Brighton Beach Memoirs', the bar is set so high with Allen's movies that I have to put this at no better than a 7 out of 10 among Allen's movies in overall quality. Being just good in the company of such outstanding works still rates it five stars when compared to movies as a whole.",N/A
849226,"After watching the movie you'll wonder if it was the simplicity of the movie or the overwhelming charm and beauty of Giovanna Mezzogiorno that captivated your attention. I guess it is a combination of both (however, I am tempted to give more marks to the sparkling beauty of Giovanna Mezzogiorno).Giovanna and her husband run into an octogenarian (played by Massimo Girotti) suffering from partial amnesia on the streets of Rome. Reluctant to leave him alone, they bring him home for the night. He doesn't speak much, but after some coaxing by Giovanna's kids, he reveals his name as Simone. For some inexplicable reason Giovanna's husband does not take Simone to the police and Simone lands up staying with their family for a few days. In the mean time relationship between Giovanna and her husband gets strained and in a trite twist, Giovanna gets attracted towards a smart looking man living across the street (and has facing windows).Simone's memory relapse continues and he mysteriously wanders into old city, knocking on the doors of an old shop (Simone has a number etched on his forearm, which is a tell-tale insignia of a Nazi prisoner). One day, Simone goes missing and Giovanna embarks on a mini investigation to track him down. She manages to locate him. Simone is actually a very well-off ex-baker (and also a queer) who had rescued many prisoners from the Nazis. Simone teaches Giovanna some trade secrets of baking excellent cakes/pastries and indirectly advices her to avoid succumbing to temptations of an extra-marital fling with the neighbor. Giovanna overcomes her temptations, starts her life anew by starting her own bakery and accepting her husband again.The story is very simple, but the execution is wonderful. Watch it ... you wont be disappointed.",Facing Windows

907648,"The movie has a good script, good effects, good direction, excellent cinematography, and some decent performances, but is badly undermined by the disastrous miscasting of Keanu Reeves as Constantine. Reeves is a somewhat limited actor who can be good in the right role, but this isn't it. Constantine's acid cynicism is simply beyond Reeves's range. Since Reeves obviously isn't up to the task of Constantine's British accent, Constantine has been arbitrarily transformed into an American. Presumably, the studio was hoping to lure Matrix fans by casting Reeves. They would have been better advised to trust the material and find an actor such as James Marsters who could do the character properly, cynicism, accent, and all. Fans of the Constantine Hellblazer stories will probably be most disappointed. If you aren't already familiar with the Constantine character, you may be less disturbed by how badly Reeves misses the mark.",Constantine
451332,"How do you top When A Stranger Calls? Well, you don't because that's absolutely impossible. How do you equal it? Come out with a sequel that's every bit as entertaining and suspenseful, but do it in different ways. many have said that again this movie like its' predecessor has a terriffic opening and ending with a slow going central piece. Others think the central piece is better here than in the original. I feel that When a Stranger Calls Back is a thrill ride all it's own that builds upon premises and themes that the original helped Hollywood capitalize on in numerous films after the original Stranger. As such a movie it can only do better than all those that followed the original stranger since stranger was the standard. In When a Stranger Calls Back we see a much hardened Jill played by Kane, now an advocate for women taking charge of themselves and not depending on dismissive men around them to keep them safe. while the transformation is a wonderful thing to see, you still feel the presence of the original scared girl that had us so riveted in the first movie. In comparison, our young heroine in ""Back"" that Kane's character Jill befriends never really manages to push the button of that nerve Kane so brilliantly did in the first movie, she only touches on it. Still, Back is an unending supply of suspense and mindplay that keeps you just as riveted as the original did. The climax is more reminiscent of the brilliant Wait Until Dark, but is just as intense as the original When a Stranger Calls. All in all, When a Stranger Calls Back is a must see thrill ride that is equally as great as the first, but has terror that is more distributed than concentrated.  5.5 stars",When a Stranger Calls Back

Cary Grant plays a gambler who convinces a wartime relief organization to run a gambling function for one night to raise money for supplies to send overseas. Only his real motive is to keep all the profits for himself and skip town. But he falls in love with the organization's leader (Lorraine Day) and reforms. There is one horrendous scene in a church where Grant comes to see the light, but otherwise the picture is pretty good. Day is more a looker than an actress, but Grant is good in the lead. It's very well directed, with some interesting use of ""silent conversation"" behind glass doors that open so we can catch the main points as they're said.

It is nothing like the first two, but for me, that was a good thing.  I think that is why this one is getting bashed by some.  (Except for the reviewer who called it a ""stoner movie"".  She's clearly a cultural snob who belives in philosophical elitism, but I digress.)I thought the first 2 Qatsi movies were too slowly paced and didn't really show anything I hadn't seen before (Time-lapse footage of traffic.....awesome.)  About half way through both I was fairly bored, understood what the filmmakers were doing, and wanted to move on.  That being said, I'm sure if I had seen them earlier when they first came out, I would have been blown away.  Many years have passed, and with 500+ channel TV, internet, DVD, etc., the images aren't as powerful now as they probably were 10-15 years ago.  Back then, you just didn't see things like the images seen in the Qatsi movies.  So I can see why people who loved the first 2 movies would be let down by Naqoyqatsi.  I think it's the same reason why younger people like myself (I'm 24) will enjoy Naqoyqatsi more.  It's more modern and more relevant than either of the first two.  It doesn't drag as much either.  The only part that I got bored with was the athletes segment, which definitely went on a bit longer than needed.This one is worth buying for sure.  Naqoyqatsi is a beautiful collage of images and music that is intensely thought provoking.",N/A
602621,"DARK BLUEGREAT FILMThis film is as powerful as it is gripping and not necessarily because it is a classic film, because it's not. The film its self is a good film but not one of the all time greats, it's because of the subject matter in this film, and that makes it good. The film is centered around Eldon Perry {Kurt Russell} and his rookie partner played by Scott Speedman. As they are out to solve a robbery/multi homicide during the time of the Rodney King beating, which has everything/nothing to do with the film. As the film proceeds toward the end of the film each one of the two proceeds to have a change of heart. One because he is really a good hearted person and the other because his wife leaves him and his boss wants to have him killed. So one dies for his beliefs and the other gives out the dirt live in front of the force and media about what he did and his boss.One of the most interesting things about this film is the riot that breaks out because of the verdict in the King beating trial. In fact one of the most memorable moments is when DASH MIHOK is killed by all the black guys because he is white, sadly things like that really happened when the riot happened. Director Ron Shelton did an excellent job with this film, but the acting is what makes this film a great movie.Kurt Russell may actually give his best performance ever in this film, his gritty corrupt cop role is played with excellence. And Ving Rhames is excellent in his role as well has the next chief of police, I was really pleased to learn of his presence in this film. But the best thing about this film is two small supporting roles in KURUPT, and Dash Mihok. The two fiendish friends in this film who kick it off in the beginning are definitely the most entertaining to watch threw out the entire film. I dare u to watch the film and not agree with me. Each scene the two are in is heightened by their presence. I just wish these two would have had more screen time.Over all this is a very good film, I recommend it to any body looking for a good, entertaining film.",N/A

29420,"Director:  Wes Craven.Cast:  John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, Johnny Depp.Rated R for violence, language, gore, and mild sexual situations.Running Time:  91 minutes.Director Wes Craven's coming out party, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of the most original spine-tinglers of the past quarter-century.  What the film lacks in budget and special effects is made up with a superb, mesmerizing script written by Craven, a devilish performance by the underrated Robert Englund as the demonic fiend, and an excellent musical score that only heightens the tension.Heather Langenkamp stars as Nancy Thompson, a regular teenage girl who wants nothing but to fit in and life a normal life.  Her world is turned upside down as her terrifying dreams of a burnt maniac with knifes for fingers becomes a reality.  As Freddy Krueger, the infamous murderer, stalks all of Nancy's friends in their dreams, Nancy attempts to uncover the secrets behind Kreuger, learn why he is after her, and stop him once and for all.  John Saxon stars as the police officer daddy who would do anything for his little girl, but we soon find out that he is not all that he is not all that he is cracked up to be.Famous for many of its incredibly outlandish murder sequences, including the scene in which a girl is tossed around the ceiling of her room, bleeding profusely from knife wounds, as her boyfriend watches petrified in the corner.  Craven does a masterful job of creating suspense that leads to the ultimate showdown between good and evil.  He also takes a page from John Carpenter's play book and keeps the twists and turns coming until the last reel.  Robert Englund is stupendous as the icon Krueger, allowing enough of his humorous personality to surface throughout the performance, but it does not envelop the film and take away from the genuine terror on the screen.  ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a true masterpiece of cinematic horror--originality, great performances from the entire cast, and of course, an introductory role from none other than Johnny Depp.  Gory, slasher horror at its creepy finest.",N/A

Sharona fulfills her role as the ""Watson"" character in a way that is beyond good.Trivial, but noticeable: I do wish some reviewers would get this right ... Monk solves way more than one case a show, in fact usually several, so its not just a matter of a new season and ""16 more cases to solve"", in fact it is closer to double that amount, easily.Sharona just disappears ""Mid-Season"", and The so-called  Sharona  clone, Natalie, is introduced. Well, she is not, officially, a Sharona  clone. Yes she is a new assistant, but look at the specials on disk 3.The Special  Feature LIFE BEFORE  MONK is actually at odds with the NATALIE  TEEGER PROFILE, where Tony says ( wether for the official  Studio line, or ?? ) that the change to Natalie is to basically cut loose Monk and see if/how he grows. Well, check out the two special  features on disc 3, the two are incompatible as views on the same  situation.From Shows 1-9 in the third series, Sharona Helps Monk, Motivates Monk, and pushes him on to do more; Sharona is the emotional, and plot catalyst in many ways ( she  rips the Hair piece off the Commisioner, and thus helps solve the case).In the Shows 10-16, Teeger is a fifth wheel, does less than Sharona, and is superbly vacuous. One scene has Monk asking why she is doing something and ""Natalie"" says "" I can do anything I want, I'm cute..."".In one great episode, Mako ( as Master Zee) makes some observations that resonate so well, and in a manner that only Mako, a superb character player, can deliver.I don't want to say which scenes are the best emotionally, but when Monk/Adrian, gets to play essentially on his own, Monk is superbly emotional and emotive.If they can find a way to restore Sharona, then this will restore the original Successful Formula.Also,the Box is of a high Quality than previous boxes; contrary to some comments, the smaller plastic covers are better than the foldouts in Seasons  1 and 2 because they are more  robust. I have bought enough of the Digipack foldouts to know, and to be able to recommend that the Individual  Disc  Covers are Superb.I honestly hope that this is not the last Major Season of Monk, but maybe, like so many great shows, three seasons is the limit; however, some superb shows can last 8 seasons with great writing. In my view, the core writing idea is great, what you need is maybe some fresh views on a timeless plot structure, not a change to a vacuous assistant that allows the lead to show his skills. The superb essence of this show is the ensemble cast that works so very, VERY  well.",Monk: Season Three

It scared the HELL out of me visually at times. Unfortunately it also confused me. I wasn't expecting flashbacks and sequences that you had no way to be sure if they were real or not, and the plot just wasn't strong.Two friends at a girl's school in Seoul take ballet class in school. It came naturally for So-hee, but Jin-sung has to work very hard to be good and the teacher reminded her. So-hee had been sitting out injured w/ wraps to heal. As things move along, we see that So-hee is an adorable, vibrant personality that does things spontaneously, like sneaking out to a concert or into the school dorm to talk to Jin-sung late at night. One night she says she only does ballet because her mother forces her and she'd rather quit. Then she says that it makes her feel alive. Before she leaves she tells Jin-sung that in 10 years they'll be performing in London, her as Giselle (the lead) and Jin as some other character and leaves. So-hee is also pretty insensitive, clueless, and self-preoccupied. Around this time, the fat, crazy girl in the school with orange hair has been wandering around- being weird. The ""wishing stairs"" are mentioned and explained in the beginning, and her fascination. One day- she appears to have lost weight, but she still acts and walks awkwardly- she tells Jin-sung what happened. In the meantime, it has been announced that there will be an audition and the best goes to a competition where the winner goes to ballet school in Russia. No one is excited because So-hee takes off her wraps and dances like she was never injured- which inspires gossip. Jin-sung overhears So-hee getting pointers on her dance,etc. -So-hee is so self-centered you really want Jin-sung to win!!Jin goes to the stais, makes a wish to go to the competition -totally innocent. The next day she breaks a glass in the locker room and switches toe shoes- she comes out ans as Soo-hee dances, her foot starts to bleed badly. Ignoring it, she finishes perfectly and no one mentions it. After that Jin doesn't even want to talk to So-hee who keeps bugging her. Things come to a head on a staircase where Jin tells her she hates her and So-hee, used to getting everything she wants, grabs her. Jin tries to get loose and Soo-hee falls down the stairs. Jin wins the competition in So-hee's place and we see her go to the hospital. So-hee looks fine and is wheeling around in a wheel-chair. Next day- news that she's dead(?!?!?) and everyone is mad at Jin. That's when the crazy girl mourns the loss of her secret idol by asking the stairs to bring her back to her. That's when the hauntings and possessions begin. The scene of So-hee as a dead girl in her costume following Jin and dancing was terrifying! 5 stars to that, but other things were just too confusing and not explained after that. At the beginning and that one point, it IS the movie described on the box, before it shatters into confusion again.This is the third movie in the Whispering Corriders series.",Wishing Stairs

More linear in its story than Ju-On; it's a somewhat languid, suspenseful build up on some creepy moments.  A harried divorcee attempts to provide a home for her daughter whom she has been granted custody of.  They arrive at a solemn gray apartment complex and are given the unit directly below a family which lost their daughter a few years ago.  Bits and pieces of the mother's mental history come out in custody interviews and we learn that she's struggled with sleep disorders and various mania for a while.  All this serves to call into question her validity as the point of reference for the weird happenings including a forever dripping ceiling and the appearance of the mysterious missing girl, whose face is always slightly obscured and blurred.  The lead character of the mother is at once sympathetic and pathetic, you can see her disintegration commencing as the movie progresses.

598139,"This is a film about mother/daughter relationships and about unconditional love. Despite being marked by fine performances, the film never really grabs the viewer, at least, not this viewer. While moderately enjoyable, I found the film to fall a little flat, as the whole Ya-Ya thing left me cold, finding it all a bit silly.Not having read the book of the same name upon which the film is based, I  had no frame of reference. Judging strictly on the merits of the film, I found that it has its ups and downs. The name of the film is apparently derived from a childhood club to which a group of lifelong friends belonged as children in which they were all Ya-Ya priestesses.  These friends, of which Vivi (Ellyn Burstyn) is at the center of this story, are all trying to reconcile Vivi to her daughter Sidda (Sandra Bullock). The friends, as well as Vivi, are all aging southern belles from Louisiana. Sidda, however, has moved North, where she is a budding, successful playwright.Sidda had a traumatic childhood, as her mother is a mercurial woman with a drinking problem. It seems that Vivi never got over losing her childhood sweetheart during the war. She married another man, Shep Walker (James Garner), Sidda's father and a man who has loved Vivi unconditionally throughout their entire married life,  and proceeded to put her husband and her children through a living hell. Still, Vivi and Sidda manage to plod along as so many mothers and daughters do, until Vivi goes too far and Sidda decides that enough is enough.The story of Vivi, Sidda, and Shep is told in flashbacks, which provide the  most interesting parts of the movie. Ashley Judd is simply sensational as the young Vivi, and she outshines all the film and stage veterans in this film, infusing the role with a gritty reality. David Lee Smith is very good as the hunky young Shep, the husband who tries to understand a mercurial wife who has become unbalanced by her longing for what could never be.Ellen Burstyn as the senior Vivi is not as compelling as the younger one portrayed by Ashley Judd. The senior Vivi comes across as a silly, petulant, spoiled, self-absorbed woman who needs a good swift kick in the butt. Consequently, the viewer cares very little for what happens to her, even though she is eventually reconciled to her daughter and comes to appreciate her patient, selfless husband.Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan, and Shirley Knight are all excellent as Vivi's lifelong friends, though Ms. Smith occasionally seems to have a bit of difficulty suppressing her British accent. They inject a touch of humor into their attempts to reconcile the estranged Vivi and Sidda, which is a good counterpoint to the underlying pathos of the film. Sandra Bullock is also excellent as the fed up Sidda, who has said that enough is enough. As in all her film, she charms the viewer. James Garner is wonderful as Vivi's long suffering husband, who comes to be appreciated by Vivi only at the end.Unfortunately, the director appears to have striven for mawkishness. Consequently, the ending of this film is enough to make one gag,  as Sidda is inducted into the Ya-Ya sisterhood. This alone is enough for me to counsel viewers to rent, and not buy, this film.",N/A

494572,"As a kid growing up in the 1980s, I used to watch this movie all the time on HBO. The Last Dragon is one of those movies you see as a child, and you remember it for years into the future. I don't quite know what it is about this film, but it certainly is memorable. I agree 100% with the other viewer that said movies in the 80's had a certain quality about them that you just don't get anymore.The Last Dragon is as charasmatic as it comes. Part martial arts beat-em-up, part drama, part comedy, and part romantic love story; the formula sounds like a disaster on paper but The Last Dragon pulls it off nicely in an all-around enjoyable film.I take the film to also be, at least in part, a social satire as well. The cast of characters includes people from a wide variety of racial/ethnic backgrounds, and the movie itself abounds in stereotypes. However, there is a major dose of role reversal, as the stereotypes are moved around and attached to different groups. Thus, we have a black martial arts hero who constantly utters ""wise old man"" proverbs and a black shogun wannabe who serves as one of the key villains. The neighborhood pizza parlor is operated by an African-American family, while a trio of Chinese males shoot craps, smoke weed, and constantly engage in the dozens. The tongue-in-cheek approach is part of what gives The Last Dragon its drive.The only reason I give this DVD four stars instead of five is because the disc contains barely any extras. You have the director's commentary and that's it. I get annoyed when films that are classics go light on the extra features. Other than that, I highly recommend The Last Dragon. The actual digital quality of the movie is outstanding. The picture quality of the disc is great, with one of the best quality transfers from VHS to DVD of any movie I know of. Also, the soundtrack has been digitally remastered as sounds great on your TV.The Last Dragon is both a quality film and a high quality disc.",N/A

I am extremely disappointed in the decisions they have been making regarding the release of this series.  I will NOT buy this 6 disc set.  I reiterate the words of a previous reviewer when I say that people do enjoy this series and would probably buy this, but not when it's produced with such incompetent negligence and disrepect for the fanbase.  I hope people will boycott this edition lest it be a subtle marketing ploy (often done by George Lucas with his orginal Star Wars movies) to hook devoted customers into buying this edition, and then to release a set in season format with additional episodes among those that have already been released.

849236,"(Very) Loosely based on Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud's famous comic strip, Blueberry, Jan Kounen's Renegade only uses the French artist's work as a starting point for which to go off on all kinds of fanciful, metaphysical tangents. It starts with obvious nods to Sergio Leone's expansive widescreen spaghetti westerns and ends up tripping the light fantastic with blatant references to the cosmic climax of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.From the opening shots of vast, sun-drenched desert landscapes to the lush, green forests that the Native American inhabit, Renegade is saturated in atmosphere. It is rich in texture and detail that immerses the viewer in this world. Kounen uses an impressive arsenal of visual tricks, such as time lapse photography and dissolves to enhance the mystical effect that he is trying to achieve. By the film's climatic 20 minute mind-trip, the director cranks up his style to a whole other psychedelic kaleidoscope of computer generated abstractions that threatens to overload the senses. After the ten-minute mark it gets to be a little much and after that point it becomes an endurance test.Renegade is a western but with a definite European sensibility that is steeped in symbolism and flashy style. Kounen simultaneously celebrates traditional western iconography (six-shooters, horses, etc.) and subverts it with images of mysticism and magic (animal totems). In this respect it bears more than a passing resemblance to the similarly minded western, Dead Man by Jim Jarmusch. Like it, Renegade is an artsy western but with pretensions to 2001-like cosmic and spiritual awareness. After the last image fades you are practically choking on the dense and intense imagery that comes off as extremely pretentious. But after awhile and once the film's imagery sinks in, some of Renegade's striking imagery lingers.",N/A

739257,"Did Charlton Heston get blind-sided by Michael Moore?  Yes, but he's definitely old enough and savvy enough to know better.  Did Moore gain entry to the Heston Hollywood mansion using false pretenses?  No, he told the one-time celluloid god of the waters that he was a lifetime, paid-up member of the National Rifle Association, and once inside even showed his membership card.  And, although the average guy in the street might be disarmed by Moore's folksy style and declasse dress code, Heston knew that Moore was a big time media guy (previous film: Roger and Me; book: Stupid White Men).But Heston never misses a chance to spread the Second Amendment gospel.  He just thought he could handle the situation.  There's no fool like an old fool, they say.  To his credit, when he realized that he had fallen into a trap, he moseyed off, putting one gimpy leg carefully in front of the other as he carried a bent back and a 79-year-old frame off camera.Well, was this fair?  Indeed, was the entire film fair?  No, of course not.  This is Michael Moore simultaneously making a buck, building a rep, and working a cause.  The cause is something like 11,000 dead-by-gunshot Americans every year (a pretty good cause), and the target is indeed Charlton Heston, long-time spokesman not only for God, but more significantly, the NRA, and of course gun and ammo manufacturers and sellers.  So at least we can say that Michael Moore was after big game.He mostly bagged them too (and made Dick Clark look heartless), but somehow I didn't gain much satisfaction.  I don't care much for Charlton Heston, either as an actor or a proselytizer, but I am finding, after watching this and Fahrenheit 9/11, that I don't care much for Michael Moore either.  I think all good, right-thinking liberals should continue to play fair even though the opposition might not.  This film preached to the choir and a good time was had by all who agree with Moore's point of view.  The cover on this DVD even quotes Time Magazine as saying the film is ""hilarious.""Somehow though I don't think those on the right thought it was all that funny.  And I wonder if those in the middle were swayed one way or the other.  It is indeed heartbreaking that kids in this country pick up guns and shoot each other, and the fact that they do it much more often per capita than any other country in the First World does indeed call for an explanation.  Ironically, I think Heston actually had the answer.  This is a violent country with a violent history relative to other industrial nations.  Moore and Heston agreed that our history isn't more violent than, say, Germany's, but they got their ideas confused.  In Germany the violence was by the state and its armies and its police.  We have plenty of that as well of course, but in the US we also have a tradition of the handy six-shooter in the holster for a quick draw and a further tradition of celebrating the rugged individual who stands up against the state and anyone wanting to take his arms away.Personally I think there's a lot to be said and not said for both sides in this all too American debate.  The Freudian implication that would-be macho guys need guns symbolically to feel like men is very real.  It was no accident that Heston let slip the ""multi-ethnic"" rationale for explaining all those dead by firearms in the USA, a rationale that is usually interpreted to mean fear of a big black dude breaking into one's home.  Or actually that is often a sort of ""make my day"" fantasy indulged in by some randy militia types as they sip a little Jack Daniels on the front porch swing as they fondle their weapon.Well, what's the answer?  There is no answer.  It is a gradual process from the jungle to civilization, and the US, in this gun-toting regard, is just a little behind the rest of the West.  If Michael Moore wants to focus on some people who really adore their weapons, he should take a trip to Iraq or Afghanistan, or just watch the nightly news.Still this is worth seeing as a kind of Americana snapshot portfolio.  Marilyn Manson proves a fine foil for Charlton Heston, and the Afro-American elementary school principal can be balanced against the poor little black kid who shot the little white girl, who can be contrasted with the members of the NRA who think the black kid should be tried as an adult, who can be contrasted with the kids at Columbine who were just there when it happened.  And the mentality of Moore and his crew in imagining that they won a ""victory"" against K-Mart when it agreed to take the ammo off it shelves can be contrasted with the young dude who was disappointed that he wasn't named a number one collaborating suspect.  (Actually the ammo sales are small potatoes to K-Mart which has big management and bottom-line problems.)But see this to study the techniques used by Moore.

227250,"One of the more under-appreciated comedies of the 1980's, Johnny Dangerously seems to have slipped under the radar of the majority of the movie viewing public. But this is a true gem of a comedy created in the spirit of cult hits like Airplane and The Naked Gun. Sporting an all-star cast, and an endless number of hilarious scenes and one-liners, Johnny Dangerously is one of my favorite comedy films of all time. Michael Keaton is at his best in a comedic role (much like Tom Hanks before he too moved into more serious roles). Joe Piscopo also turns in one of his most memorable movie appearances, but the show stealer is little known actor Richard Dimitri in his portrayal of Roman Moronie - that fargin' bastage can really act!Set in the 1930's, Johnny Dangerously follows the life of Johnny Kelly (Michael Keaton), an honest, All-American boy who turns to a life of crime in order to help pay for his mother's ever-mounting medical bills. When local gangster Jocko Dundee (Peter Boyle) has his butt saved by the enterprising young paperboy, he gives him the nickname Johnny Dangerously and hires him to work as courier in his operation. Boyle, a superb actor in his own right (Honeymoon In Vegas and Everybody Loves Raymond), has several great one-liners, and right from the start, this movie is scene after scene of laughs...As the years pass, Johnny works his way up in the Dundee gang, which wages a constant turf war with the immigrant mobster Roman Moronie (Richard Dimitri). However, when Jocko is assassinated, Johnny is appointed to take his place, prompting inter-gang rival Danny Vermin (Joe Piscopo) to form his own gang in direct competition to Johnny. The situation is further complicated when Johnny's little brother, Tommy (Griffin Dunne), rises to the position of Attorney General, vowing to take on mobsters like Johnny Dangerously. When Danny Vermin finds out that Johnny and Tommy are brothers, he uses the information to his own advantage - threatening to ruin Johnny and all he holds dear...Featuring a brief appearance by Danny DeVito, and Marliu Henner starring in a supporting role, Johnny Dangerously is packed with top-tier talent. Well written, and absolutely hilarious, the film is another comedy classic for director Amy Heckerling (Fast Times At Ridgemont High, European Vacation, Clueless, and A Night At The Roxbury). The laughs are endless in Johnny Dangerously, which is filled with scenes such as the one where Michael Keaton gives his mob buddies a pep talk about the need to compete against ""low-cost, high-quality Japanese gangs"" and Joe Piscopo's warning to not hang him on a hook, because his ""sister hung him on a hook once... Once!""The key to Johnny Dangerously's success is the performers and their ability to deliver the lines with absolute perfection. A cast with lesser experience in the realm of comedy would have made this movie a footnote in history. Instead, Johnny Dangerously turned out to be one of the top comedies of the decade. If you haven't seen it (and a lot of people haven't even heard of it), then I highly recommend that you watch Johnny Dangerously. It's quite simply one of the funniest films ever made, and it's definitely a must-see...The DVD Report",N/A
866789,"Call me a sap if you like, but I think MR. 3000 tells a beautiful story. Predictable? Maybe. Cliched? Possibly. And yet, it's so well-written and directed, so vividly acted, and so attentive to characters rather than to attending to carrying out a sports-movie formula, that I never FELT that the movie was musty or cliched. The whole thing feels fresh. It's also funny and, in the end, rather touching.MR. 3000 is basically about a selfish man's comeuppance. After getting his 3000th hit, Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) decides to rest on his laurels and retire from baseball---even as his team, the Milwaukee Brewers, is in the midst of playoff contention. Nine years later, Ross finds out that he didn't have his 3000 hits after all; a counting error caused a few hits to count more than once, and he really had only 2997 when he retired. His pride having taken a beating, he decides to return to baseball to get his final three hits...and, in the process, grows up a little from the selfish man he was in the past.It's a plot that doesn't sound all that fresh on paper. But there's no anticipating the depth that the screenwriters, director Charles Stone III, and Bernie Mac bring to the character of Stan Ross. Ross could have been made into a caricature of arrogance, a painfully funny stick figure of a character off of whom easy satirical points could have been scored. But the Ross of MR. 3000 is disarmingly likable in spite of his (hilarious) flaws, because you realize that, despite his me-first nature, he really does love the game of baseball, and understands how it works. It is with this understanding that he becomes a mentor of sorts to the new Brewers team he joins: a group of self-satisfied, self-absorbed players who seem to care little about the game itself (and their indifference is reflected in their cellar-dwelling status in their league). In one scene, Ross sees a faintly disturbing reflection of his old self in T-Rex (Brian J. White), and, as T-Rex is about to get into his car, Ross stops him and advises him on the virtues of becoming a forceful team leader, one who can encourage the highest level of play from the team. Ross has clearly seen enough to know what makes for a winning team, and that is what makes Ross an admirable character regardless of his inflated ego.But, of course, at that point of the movie, you might be thinking that he's being a little hypocritical, telling a teammate to act like a team leader when he himself hasn't shown a great deal of similar unselfish attributes. It is precisely that kind of character complexity and nuance that makes MR. 3000 stand out from the usual standard sports-movie ilk, with its comic caricatures and by-the-numbers plots. The film doesn't take a mechanical approach to Stan Ross' change of heart. When Hit No. 3000 looms on the horizon for him, Ross decides to call for an extra team practice...only to blow it off himself in order to appear on Jay Leno. He still can't resist the lure of his own ego, even as he selflessly inspires his team to try to at least go down fighting.Stan Ross is a character that has been sensitively written by its three credited writers (Eric Champnella, Keith Mitchell, and Howard Michael Gould), but of course it's up to the actor to bring a character to life, and Bernie Mac comes through with a performance that is better than anyone had a right to expect from a man whose first leading role this is. Whereas another actor might have gone for psychological depth in portraying Ross' selfishness, Mac makes it light and funny. But Mac does achieve some real moments of emotional gravitas, moments in which one can sense, looking at Mac's expressive face at certain moments, that Ross' anxiety and fear about losing his hard-fought legacy loom in his head. It's a charming, beautifully-shaded, marvelous performance, and for all the hype Jamie Foxx garnered for his Ray Charles interpretation in RAY, Bernie Mac's may actually be superior in its emotional impact. Seriously.Director Charles Stone III keeps everything light, fresh and above all honest; this movie, which could easily have given into Hollywood-style bathos, never becomes overly sentimental with its change-of-heart story. Instead, it is emotionally convincing every step of the way. Stone---as well as the script, of course---also shows an awareness of the realities of the game of baseball today: how pro athletes can sometimes be less than serious about the game they're playing, how baseball owners can sometimes be concerned only about drawing in crowds, how sensitive media members can be when a player treats them less than respectfully, etc. You can see how a focused player like Stan Ross could be considered a refreshing and even uplifting presence in the midst of such cynicism. Thankfully, the movie itself never becomes merely cynical: even as it takes some sharp jabs at baseball as it is run today, there is always that faint recognition of truth that makes for an enriching movie.By the end of MR. 3000, the movie inevitably comes down to a last-ditch effort in the bottom of the 9th inning in a tie game. And eventually Stan Ross gets redemption---but not the kind of redemption he necessarily expects. It's perhaps not as surprising an ending as the filmmakers clearly want it to be; still, it is a beautifully fitting ending, one that puts a capper on a surprisingly better-than-average sports movie. Call me sentimental, but I found MR. 3000 touching. Recommended.",N/A
347411,"[...].  ""The Fox and the Hound ranks as one of the studio's lesser efforts, but it suggests that better films were soon to follow."" What is that supposed to mean? Despite what some may say, I think nearly every Disney animated film from ""Snow White"" to the mid-90s are magical. (There are others past that, but those are what I consider their classics. Don't get me wrong, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is adorable, but I won't remember it 30 years from now like ""Aladdin"" or ""Bambi"". I think ""Brother Bear"" was a notable exception, perhaps.) ""The Fox and the Hound"" was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was probably in Kindergarten-2nd grade. It is such a simple story, but it's definitely one of the studio's most heartwarming. Like others have said, it's most certainly bittersweet. This is the story of a young Fox, whose mother is shot. A kindly old owl is concerned about the orphan and arranges for a kindly farmwoman to adopt him. Young Tod soon meets Copper, the hunter-neighbor's hound puppy. They form a dear friendship. However, Copper leaves to learn how to be a hunting dog and their friendship is never the same. I don't know who wrote the songs in this movie, but whoever did, I salute them. ""When You're the Best of Friends"" and ""Goodbye my Seem Forever"" (I'm not sure if those are the original titles, they're my best guesses.) are beautiful, heart-wrenching songs.

628976,"Mel Gibson served as co-producer of this routine revenge thriller that harkens back to the days of Charles Bronson in the original Death Wish.

771718,"""The Driver's Seat"" is pure arty trash, pretentious, boring and smugly self-conscious, a blatant exploitation of Elizabeth Taylor in which she was obviously a willing participant.  Someone was smoking something when they concocted this one, but it's a-typical of the sort of stuff that tried hard to shock and be esoteric during the 70's.  The plot, such as it is, concerns a woman sought by the police who wanders around, looking for the right man to kill her.  Anyone who doesn't know what ""going south"" means might not realize her intent at first, but unless they're a diehard Elizabeth Taylor fan, I can't imagine they would care one way or the other what she's up to.  Basically Taylor is in her ""strange"" phase, the anti-MGM star, and here she is becoming blowsy and given to wild and tasteless patterns in clothes and frizzy hair, her milieu during this period along with kaftans, but even when shrieking like a harridan or filmed with unforgiving, show-every-bump-on-the-complexion lighting (as is the case here), Taylor is still an amazingly beautiful woman on a scale that few have ever come close to.  This is not one of her better performances, however; it is an excuse to show her clutching her own breasts and writhing on a bed and rolling around in seedy encounters with equally seedy men who spout such ""clever"" lines as, ""I need my daily orgasm"" and being as weird and self-indulgent as possible.  Andy Warhol even makes an appearance.  About as deep as a night at Studio 54 and every bit as banal.

""The Life Aquatic"" is also a fake documentary, and the premise is that oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) hunts for the mythical Jaguar Shark that ate his friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel). There are many similarities between these two films, so if you enjoyed the Hertzog film, you will like this, and vice versa.Along with Murray and Cassell, the film boasts a cast of many well known actors, including Owen Wilson who plays Murray's presumed son, Cate Blanchett as a reporter, Angelica Huston as Murray's wife, as well as Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, and Bud Cort.The talent that shines the brightest is singer/guitarist Seu Jorge, whose material is excellent (including some David Bowie songs translated into Portuguese), and vocal style wonderful.Writer/director Wes Anderson missed some opportunities here; a more cohesive script and editing would have made this film a far more entertaining adventure, and also greater use of the marvelous stop motion animated effects of marine life, which are a delight, but are few and far between.

But seeing her file for divorce (after finally saving and winning back his heart) to marry another (Orlando played by Shemar Moore) with christian values, was even tougher. Is this what marriage has come to?Despite the stereotyping and Christian principles utilized carelessly throughout the script, I found ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" to be one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Just forget all your burdens u had today, get some food, sit back, and relax before watching this. You will be entertained.",N/A
368373,Akira the animated film is a different animal from it's original comic book/graphic novel series. The printed series is far superior to this animated one and if you just plop in the DVD you're more than likely going to be confused as to what's happening in the end. Tetsuo's power is so overwhelming that he cannot control it thus it manifests itself in the grotesque flesh mutation we see at the end of the movie. In the books this happens over a long period of time so we know exactly what is happening to him. Akira himself appears in the book series as a little boy but in the film we see him in parts contained in jars of liquid. When you know the difference between what we read and what we see in this film then can we only appreciate what Akira is really about.I would not recommend this DVD to anyone unless you have read through the paper series and can understand what the whole story is about. If you're just a technical junkie then the animation prowess Otomo presents in this film may be enough to get you to like it.Overall the series is an absolute must read and the film itself is good but is rather condensed which is what is confusing a lot of the reviewers I have read through.,Akira VHS
901855,"The grand irony of ""Hitch"" is that it talks the talk but in the end does not walk the walk.  The best part of this 2005 romantic comedy happen when the title character, Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), a.k.a. the ""Date Doctor,"" and his newest pupil, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) are making an effort to impress the women with whom they are smitten.  Respectively, these ladies are Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a smart but cynical gossip columnist for a New York City tabloid, and Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a glamorous celebrity socialite.  Nobody can get past the cold exterior that Sara has built around herself and everybody, especially the rest of the NYC celebrity set wants a piece of Allegra.Hitch decides he is interested in Sara and his opening gambits in getting her to respond are brilliant.  The script by Kevin Bisch provides a hook (at the bar) and a line (at her office) that set up a literal sinker (on the water).  More importantly, Will Smith could not be more comfortable playing a character.  Hitch is charming and he is smart, and despite a couple of problems with this first ""date,"" you have no trouble believing he is the ""Date Doctor.""  Albert is an accountant and in great need of Hitch's coaching, even to the point of needing advice whispered in his ear while having a face to face conversation with the woman he adores (try doing THAT Cyrano de Bergerac).  But when Albert first manages to get Allegra's attention, and when he manages to get her to attend a function and has to run the gauntlet of her friends, he proves himself up to the task, and the important thing is that although Hitch has set up objectives (e.g., ""shock and awe""), it is Albert who comes up with the specifics.  James's performance is almost as good as Smith's, but take into consideration that his role is harder, because he has to be both the timid accountant who needs all the help in the world and the guy who has his own charming side when he has the confidence to make it work for him.The problem with ""Hitch"" is that once director Andy Tennant has shown us that the Date Doctor is effective, both for his clients as well as in his own behalf, he decides that that he has come not to praise Hitch but to bury him.  I disagree with this diagnosis.  Hitch is not a smooth operator, which is a bad thing (a.k.a. being a pig), Hitch is just flat out smooth (I never thought I would say this, but Will Smith could be the closest thing we have to a new Cary Grant).  He is not scheming to seduce Sara, he is interested in her and capable of playing the high stakes came it takes to get her to actually take a guy seriously.  Likewise, Albert is not faking.  He has a better understanding of what it is he needs to do and why, and he makes an earnest attempt to do what needs to be done.  Neither one of them is lying when they say what they say and there is certainly nothing wrong with trying to put your best foot forward.  For that matter, knowing what that means in all of its myriad forms is not a bad thing either when you are trying to impress the woman you love.But when Hitch has his big moment of revelation and says what the script thinks is his big line, THAT is when the character tells his first lie.  Because what he says is simply not true and the proof for it is so simple: If Hitch had never talked to Albert how far would our accounting nebbish have gotten with Allegra?  For that matter, what in all honesty could Hitch have done to impress Sara given the dazzling display that we say it took from him to get her to agree to go out in the first place?  However, before the big dramatic ending ruins ""Hitch"" this is a pretty good romantic comedy with lots of smart and funny scenes, so there will be a lot of people willing to enjoy it and gloss over the hypocrisy of the final act, especially with all that cool dancing during the end credits.  But I have rarely seen a film whose self-proclaimed moral so badly missed the lesson it spent one hour and forty-five minutes developing.",N/A

624754,"As a moderate fan of this film's predecessors - namely the ""Alien"" series - I was eager to see this mighty-idea-of-a-flick long ago when Internet promotion flourished as much as a year before the film's theatrical release.  It's a mammoth undertaking to bring two screen legends to one place at one time - left to duke it out until the best, or most ugly, man/thing is standing.  It happened nearly two years earlier with the successful ""Freddie Vs. Jason"",  which went on to slash away a whopping $82.2 million dollars from US theater goers; plus it was surprisingly effective, ultra bloody, and even a bit scary.  ""Alien Vs. Predator"" grossed a couple million less, but made up for it with a far-sturdier script and dazzling special effects display.The screenplay is well-below prolific, but as far as monster movies go it should win the Monster Oscar.  The dialogue is not jerky or forced, the settings are SMART (thank goodness it's set in present day, on Earth, and not on some unbelievable distant planet or some floating space ship - we've reverted to ancient history rather than space-age fiction), and the development and flow is speedy and quick with enough suspense in just the right places.  The writers deserve a loft paycheck for making such an unlikely meeting so much fun to watch, weaving the two movie franchises together (with direct assistance from the comic book, no doubt), and paying attention to plot and dialogue when other script writers would have relied solely on gore to sustain the movie.The acting is less-than-impressive, but, again, the film creators were on-task to assist.  Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson along with a team of 6 other contributing scriptees excelled so astoundingly that they pumped enough appeal and energy into their cast - helping to elevate them from ""B"" movie actors to ""B+"" actors with the flip of a pen and the turn of a lens.  Sigourney Weaver is painfully absent (as a prequel, her character hadn't been born yet), but Arnold Schwarzenegger is thankfully M.I.A.  (Though it might have been fun to see Weaver cream Arnold's butt.)The cinematography is unexpectedly progressive and smooth.  The camera movements, lighting, and set design are smart and efficient.  The special effects are some of the best I've ever seen, and certainly more convincing and impressive than any of this film's ancestors.  The long-headed, saliva-toothed Aliens are more alive than I've seen them before (mama Alien even comes out to run amuck this time), and Mr. Predator's dreadlocks have never looked more lively and quick.  The scenes in the ancient, underground pyramid get a bit too monotonous after a time, and the repetitive far-off eerie sounds (oh my we should be scared!) aren't as effective or as chilling as they ought to be, but you can't help but feel an impeccable rush of adrenalin when the two vile foes come face to face time and again.Now that it's on DVD, see it.Grade: C+",AVP: Alien vs. Predator
628580,"Possibly the best High-School Loser movie ever made, Napoleon Dynamite is a film that you will either love or hate but if you are willing to see through some of the silliness of the plot you will see that this is a movie about connecting with your reality whatever that may be. All of the main characters of this film are highly out of touch with mainstream society and even out of touch with themselves.  In a word they are all loners.  As a wise person once told me ""friends keep you sane"" and these people, without friends, are insane.  Living in the past, online, in another culture or just in some other dimension, they all are living lives that aren't checked by the world that goes on around them. This makes conversation, even between each other, disjointed.  Lost, somehow they come together and eventually Napoleon gets a few friends and begins to connect to some sense of reality. Napoleon's moment of revelation comes when he says ""I dont have any skills. Girls only want to go out with guys who have skills... Ninja Skills, Numchuck skills"" ... etc. Here his friend Pedro finally connects with him saying he has drawing skills (which he barely has) and Napoleon begins to have some sense of direction. The setting of the movie is somewhat absurd.  It is set in rural/suburban Idaho with all of its dreary depressingly out of date architecture, which lends itself well to the out of touch feeling the film seeks to develop.Is the movie believable? No.  Is the Movie thoroughly enjoyable? Yes.So why is this possibly the best high-school movie?  The answer is simple:  everyone feels out of touch to a certain degree in high school.  This movie portrays that vividly and humorously.  It isn't the run-of-the-mill cool people - vs. loser film but a film about individuals against the world.  Seeing the film as something other than a lame joke is key to its enjoyment but is certainly a good film for mixed audiences and anyone who has ever felt out of place... maybe even you.Ted Murena",Napoleon Dynamite
562835,"I was discouraged from getting this set by a Scottish friend of mine who is a rabid fan of Black Adder.  He said, ""You watch 'The Thin Blue Line' and cry,"" implying that it's nowhere near as good as BA.  I'm glad to say he was mistaken!""The Thin Blue Line"" is a fine BritCom.  Although nowhere near as sinister as ""Black Adder,"" the writing is still sharp and funny.  There is much more slapstick involved as well, making me feel it has more in common with ""Fawlty Towers,"" perhaps, than BA.There are two big reasons that I enjoy this show so much.  First off, is the obvious choice of Rowan Atkinson.  It's hard to find fault with him in most things, and the the same is true here.  He does such a great job of playing the middle-aged, condescending Inspector Fowler.  The character is best described as the emobodiment of those people who anally correct others' spelling mistakes on internet message boards, and Atkinson plays him well, indeed!  He also comes off blissfully aloof.  When his girlfriend suggests they do something passionate after work, he suggests reading ""King Soloman's Mines!""The second reason to watch this series is, without a doubt, James Dreyfus' performance as the figity, effeminate, Mars bar-loving Constable Goody.  He often gives Rowan a run for his money in several scenes.  His constant attempts to gain the affection of Constable Habib and his interactions with Inspector Fowler are hilarious.The only real thing I can complain about is the swap out of Det. Insp. Grim's sidekick between series one and two.  Mark Addy's character is okay in series two, but the Det. Constable Cray was hilarious in the first series.  He didn't say much, but that was the point...he was just sort of a neanderthalish guy, but the delivery was quite funny.I'm not giving this a full 5 stars simply because I am comparing it to truly untouchable stuff like ""Black Adder,"" but it's certainly a worthy addition to anyone's BritCom collection.  If you're a fan of British wit, Ben Elton or Rowan Atkinson, I highly recommend it!",N/A

631408,"Movies usually either meet, go below, or totally exceed your expectations. &lt;em>Batman Begins&lt;/em> was more masterful than I could've hoped and as far as comic book movies go it blows &lt;em>X2&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Spider-man 2&lt;/em> totally out of the water. Not only that, but it's a great movie even without being in the comic book genre. This movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the first four Batman incarnations and is not really a prequel. It's a starting Batman movie the way it was meant to be done. The acting was completely and utterly spot-on. I can't imagine if Bruce Wayne would've been so perfect without Christian Bale and Michael Caine really puts Michael Gough to shame as Alfred. Hopefully, more people will show love for Gary Oldman after him aptly portraying a pre-Comissioner Gordon. Cillian Murphy is finally showing the mainstream public, who likely hadn't heard of him, how good he really is in his role as Scarecrow and it just felt right. Katie Holmes and Morgan Freeman did very well reinventing their characters and I just love how they both interacted with Bruce Wayne. I'm not going to talk about Liam Neeson and Ken Wantanabe to avoid spoilers, but just know that they were no different from the rest.I still have more to say though so indulge me for another paragraph. Acting is all well and good, but what is it that makes this movie so special? The careful attention poured onto every shot. When you can't tell what's cg and what's real, you know you have a winner. You may think that the bats aren't real, but you'd be surprised which scenes actually had live bats. Part of this grueling attention comes from the dialogue though, which I just fell in love with. Not a single line was actually corny or out of place, but rather it got to its point without having to dumb things down at all. It all seemed pretty intricate, and I liked how key lines (especially those relating to big themes) came back. &lt;em>Batman Returns&lt;/em> came on last night and comparing this script to that one is like comparing night to day. David Goyer really outdid himself and so did Christopher Nolan. For the latter to top &lt;em>Memento&lt;/em> is no small feat, and yet he managed to do it right here. Not only was his hand in the script good but also his sense of art direction and grabbing the essence of Batman. The whole movie seems designed for people my age and older because of how dark it is. Batman isn't scary when he goes around in a batsuit like in those old four movies, but he may strike fear in you a couple of times when he does what he does this time around! It's hard for me to scrape up anything I didn't like besides one thing I don't really want to spoil (very minor anyway) and how fast the hand-to-hand combat was. I think the latter was on purpose, but I just would've preferred to see them go a little slower. Of course, it makes sense that in real life the people fighting wouldn't slow down and what this movie did best was putting you in a world where everything happening seemed possible, not gimmicky. I loved the subtle explanations of things and the batmobile may not look as sleek as before but it's definitely more useful.The video and sound quality are pretty good, though I feel that the transfer could've been a little brighter though I was watching the movie on an older television model. The special features are accessed via a comic book, which is kind of neat, but I'd rather just have it all straightforward rather than hunt for them (though if you navigate to the last page of it you can do this also). The features I've watched so far are really good and none are too long so you can easily watch them all in short bursts. They range from his training to the history of the movie's development to the costume design and down to the creation of Gotham City. Plus, you learn a lot of nifty things like how much fighting Christian Bale actually had to learn and that the scenes in the mountains were filmed on location. If you enjoyed the movie I feel that this set is pretty worthwhile. Even if they were to release a super duper edition, this is really all you need to thoroughly enjoy the film. The only thing that's missing is a commentary track, but I've heard that Nolan's commentary on &lt;em>Memento&lt;/em> sucks anyway so it's no big deal.",Batman Begins
369228,"It's easy to discuss 'Killing Zoe's problems; they are, after all, plentiful and in clear view. It's hard to deny, though, that it's an incredibly entertaining movie. It's important not to be misled by the treacherous phrase 'from the creators of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction'; Killing Zoe was directed by Roger Avary, who may has a co-writer's credit on Pulp Fiction but his part in it was quite small; in Reservoir Dogs all his actually did was write the radio dialogue that runs in the background. Quentin Tarantino was executive producer, but clearly had no influence on the creative side of the movie. The presence of Tarantino's name on the Killing Zoe DVD is a double-ended sword; on the one hand, it's what made me notice it and pick it up in the first place, and I'm sure it helped a lot in the film's sales when it was first released. On the other, it inevitably creates some high expectations, and these can hinder your enjoyment from the movie, as they did mine. Because while Killing Zoe shares with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction some themes of crime, drugs, sex and honor among thieves, it shares none of Tarantino's witty, sarcastic edge and cultural awareness.If, however, you remember to steer clear of these expectations - and if you like this kind of movie, of course - then you're bound to enjoy Killing Zoe. It's a fast-paced, entertaining crime story with lots of violence, some sense of humor, some sex and a lot of atmosphere. Very good performances are also given by the beautiful Julie Delpy (""the prostitute with a heart of gold"") and Jean-Hugues Anglade (""the psychopathic sadist""), who plays one of the coolest villains of the 90's (who's more than a bit similar to Gary Oldman's fantastic Agent Stansfield from 'Leon'), and these two almost make up for the unimpressive leading man we have in Eric Stoltz - who, though he made a fine career for himself playing small character roles in fantastic films from Pulp Fiction to Singles, had not proven himself as a capable lead since his breakthrough performance as a disfigured boy in Mask - who plays a rather unlikable and uninteresting hero.Killing Zoe is a featherweight film with absolutely no depth to the story or characters, that generally likes waving around the sex and violence for the sake of sex and violence, which are sometimes unnecessarily excessive (like the far too long sex scene at the beginning, or the gory image of the dying man near the end); it's not a very intelligent crime movie, and it won't stick with you, but it's great entertainment, with fantastic atmosphere, and for any fan of the genre - one who is not easily offended (and you'll be amazed at how dirty a dirty joke sounds in French even if you don't understand one word) - it's well worth seeing. Keep your expectations low, and you'll have lots of fun.",Killing Zoe VHS
636479,"Kate Hudson stars as a caring and sweet twenty-something nursing home assistant down in New Orleans who has had enough of retirement homes and despises how their staff and management mistreats the elderly. The general indifference towards the old, dying and dead seniors is unforgivable and intolerable, so she quits, packs her bags and seeks a more nurturing and rewarding job because her previous occupation was taking its toll on her general well being.She ends up finding a job as a care taker of an older southern gentleman, being hired by his wife, both of whom live in an old plantation mansion situated way out in the middle of a remote swamp on the outskirts of New Orleans. The caretaker's best friend questions the wisdom of this move, foreshadowing unexpected things to come. Nevertheless, she accepts the job, anxious to get away from the apathy of the big city life and looks forward to truly helping a person in need. Her wish is fulfilled, but not in the way she was hoping for. She's introduced to the manager of the estate who sets up the job interview and subsequent hiring, after he seemingly convinces the older gentleman's wife to accept the young girl to live and care for her stroke-affected husband.As her journey from the urban to rural life progresses, the audience is introduced to a rich and vibrant cajun culture, full with Hoodoo and Voodoo, not to be confused with one another. The experience for her is a bit of a culture shock to say the least, but she finds it intriguing and it fuels her desire to learn more and adapt to her newfound circumstances. What follows however isn't quite as enriching of an experience as she wanted but rather she is confronted with not only age old superstitions but also their very real impact on the people entrenched within the inherent customs and beliefs.After working for awhile in the house and getting to know the tenants a little better, exploring the house and its history, she finds herself immersed in a swamp of mystery that promises to never let her go back to her old life in more ways than one.Without revealing too much, the movie had an interesting premise with strong performances from the entire cast, not to mention the setting which is a character all by itself, but the entertainment factor of the film was lost in translation from its inability to decide whether it was a real or fictional story, and that's where the magic was debunked by its own doing. The film never had the makings of greatness but it could have ended up being a decent film had it stuck with its original direction of where the story was headed. Surprising twists can make a break a film, and in this case it was the latter. It's a shame that the indirect magic of watching the film was disspelled by its supernatural hoodoo.It might please some fans of thrillers and the supernatural, but it's barely worth watching once.",N/A

This sequel to the Kubrick classic tries to continue many themes of the original, such as the HAL-9000 computer, astronaut David Bowmen's spirit and the Discovery ship, it is hard to call it a necessary sequel because it ends up being an explanation of the events in 2001, trying to neatly package what was already a great mystery that could stand on its own two feet. Still 2010 can be viewed without ever watching 2001 (although you should). It is, for all intents and purposes, a new odyssey, that deals more with the enigma of the Discovery and the Jupiter Mission. There are some great names in the cast, Roy Scheider as Dr. Heywood Floyd, John Lithgow as Dr. Walter Curnow, Helen Mirren as Tanya Kirbuk and Bob Balaban as Dr. R. Chandra who set off onboard the Soviet deep space Leonov as a bunch of science-detectives to figure out what is going on with the old ship. Written by Arthur C. Clarke, this movie captures some wonderful moments, such as various space walks with glorious moving backdrops that will leave your head and stomach spinning. There is also the very memorable air-breaking manoeuvre around a planet and the final countdown escape sequence. All in all, even though this is a needless sequel it still manages to be downright awe inspiring stuff. Even some 20 years on it has still kept up with the times.

447327,"WARNING: In the last paragraph I reveal the film's endingI am usually annoyed by ""this"" meets ""that"" comparisons. But in this case I find it appropriate.If you struggle with films outside the mainstream, then this film is not for you. It seeks to redefine the vanguard of film-as-art (rather than sheer entertainment) and lies far, far from the mainstream (art tends to prod boundaries, challenge norms, and stimulate emotions/intellect whereas entertainment just stimulates).This film is so far removed from normalcy; I am having trouble forming an opinion about it. What is this movie about?!? Perhaps it is a comment regarding the degradation of the human psyche brought on by a self-perpetuating industrial modernization. Maybe the protagonist is coming to terms with his homosexuality. I think the latter a more viable interpretation. I would imagine the emotions depicted in this film are the very emotions a gay person would feel in a society where the stringent mores established over 2 centuries ago and covertly enforced via the fear of disrespect and banishment are just now starting to relax...slightly.I have found that the vanguard is more fully appreciated by those steeped in a genre. Thus, I'll leave interpretation or criticism to pundits. I will say this, this film exhibits a strong parallel with zombie films.Rather than interpret or assess this film I offer my impressions:Character's bodies are quivering sweaty and always in pain...constantly in motion. Morphing into the jumbled mass of rusty and discarded metal pieces that comprise their environment.Spaces are claustrophobic, dilapidated, lonely, and abandoned industrial factories lit by segregated fixtures of florescent white light. Shadows engulf whole objects rather than giving shape or softness to figures. All scenes shot outside or in any un-cramped area are sped up removing any sense of relief from claustrophobia in these potentially spacious shots.Horrific metal phalli protrude in sexual rage, penetrating, torturing, killing.The relationships between all the characters are typified by violence and/or sexual rage.Tetsuo's body is eventually overcome by metal and is physically and psychically joined with the protagonist who's quest is to convert all humans to maniacal human-shaped metal creatures.

We counted the days 'til the release; we even met Herbie and his driver during their national promotional tour. I wanted my daughters to share in my childhood affection for the beetle. I must admit to some trepidation not only to Lindsay Lohan's inclusion in the project, but to the potentially overpowering CGI Herbie like WB's live-action DOOs. But good news, the animation is well balanced and timely.  The film pays tribute to its film roots while infusing itself with enough 21st cen. references to make it appealing the next generation.If connects Herbie to the NASCAR industry, including some driver cameos (they're easy to spot: just look for the strained, cheesy acting. Sorry guys). How's this for mod refs there's even street racing and monster trucks. Herbie attitude, especially about his appearance, hasn't changed. In one of my favorite moments in the film Herbie ""keys"" the bad guy Matt Dillion's beautiful racecar with his appendage-like mirror! Herbie is still a love machine, flirting with VWs a quarter of his age, still hustling to get the protagonists together. ""Fully Loaded"" uses lots of gimmicky racing split screens and quarter screens to great effect. The movie's music, old and new, retro and original, meshes nicely with each scene.

192886,"Enough people have commented on the content of the film and its purported credibility, so I will skip that issue and focus squarely on the execution of the film.  After all, the content of a film can be wonderful but if the film is poorly executed, what's the point?WTBDWK is, in short, a mess.  Perhaps there is a coherent and entertaining film buried in there somewhere, but as it stands now, what we have is two hours of incoherence.  The switching between talking heads and a dramatic story featuring Marlee Matlin does not work.  Rather than complement one another, the film's two ""halves"" serve only to confuse and muddle the proceedings.  I found the Marlee Matlin scenes totally unnecessary - they neither enhanced the talking points nor were particularly entertaining.  The interviews were the most interesting aspect of the film, but the clips are too brief to be of much use.  Quantum physics is not something you can describe adequately in a one-minute sound bite.A better approach would have been to keep the special effects (not bad) and include longer interview segments with the so-called experts (minus the Ramtha lady, whose presence delegitimizes the entire film).

155432,"With the recent deaths of Teresa Wright and Virginia Mayo, it gives a compelling reason to revisit one of the finest of American films, a deserved classic that focuses on the challenges faced by returning WWII veterans. Directed by William Wyler, a master at capturing the spectrum of human behavior no matter the size of his canvas, this poignant 1946 film focuses on three men, all affected deeply by their wartime experiences. Ostensibly a period piece, the film's emotionalism continues to resonate and even takes on a burnished quality because of its uncommon honesty during a time that could have easily been made rose-colored by the Hollywood studio system.As the oldest of the trio, Fredric March portrays Al Stephenson, an Army sergeant, who comes home to his picture-perfect family - a loyal wife (Myrna Loy in her typical role) and two well-adjusted children. Even with such an idyllic life awaiting him, he becomes conflicted about how life has changed during his absence from the home front. Perhaps released too soon after Billy Wilder's blistering classic about alcoholism, ""The Lost Weekend"", the film dances around Al's heavy drinking which could have been an interesting angle to explore. Although March won his second Oscar for this role, I feel the film's most impressive performance actually comes from Dana Andrews, who plays Air Force bombardier Fred Derry caught between a loveless marriage to good-time gal Marie (Mayo) and a growing attraction toward Peggy, Al's fresh-scrubbed daughter (Wright). The third man is sailor Homer Parrish, portrayed in an honest, unaffected manner by real-life double amputee Harold Russell. Although it looks like the movie will focus primarily on Al's situation, Wyler cleverly shifts the story to Fred in the second half since he is the one who faces the most uncertain future. Homer's story is interspersed throughout. But what brings the film together is the palpable sense of disquiet experienced by all three in trying to assimilate into their former lives. Homer has the most obvious challenge as he faces others' discomfort in handling his disability. There is a heartbreaking scene where Russell smashes his artificial hooks through a window out of sheer frustration and terrifies his young sister to plead for forgiveness.  But the most powerful scenes belong to Andrews who faces the humiliation of going back to his pre-war soda jerk job, then slowly realizes how superficial his wife is and what he must do to build his life again, perfectly symbolized by his halting walk through a massive, desolate graveyard of junked WWII airplanes.The irony of the movie's title refers to the irretrievable fact that many servicemen experienced their best years in wartime, not in conforming their lives to peacetime as they get reacquainted with their loved ones.  It's a significant distinction treated gently by Wyler and screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood. The almost-three-hour running time goes by quickly, as one feels a true sense of empathy for all the characters, even Mayo's floozy who has more under the surface than one would suspect. Special mention needs to be given to Cathy O'Donnell's touching performance as Wilma, Homer's innocent and accepting fianc&eacute;e.  Sterling work from a bygone era.",The Best Years of Our Lives

It's incredibly fast moving story unfolds in such a jerky fashion it's hardly enjoyable.

638682,"I loved the books as a kid and enjoyed the BBC series. This movie tried so hard to be liked, like a puppy prancing around frantically licking everyone in sight. Yet for all its sincerity and studied silliness, the end result left me feeling distanced from the source material, which never felt as self conscious as this labored effort.That being said, it looked great. But that wasn't enough to offset this well intentioned but ragged script, which I am certain that involved as he was, Adams would've adjusted as the dailies rolled in. That is, if he had lived long enough to see it through.I'm giving it three stars for good intentions and for moments of greatness. But I still think that primitive as it was technically, the BBS production came closer to the spirit of the books and on the whole was a more satisfying Hitchhiker's experience.Since the above review, I have viewed this film for a second time and had a much more favorable impression. Actually, it was really quite good, all in all.  This was a difficult undertaking, as the book was episodic and really didn't have a coherent plot. The writers (including Adams) were obviously trying to make it more cinematic by attempting to give it a story arc that wasn't even in the source material. The end result really is quite satisfying as long as one tries not to compare it to the other mediums it has appeared in.Still, rather than the unequivocally enjoyable Hitchiker's Guide I was longing for,  the best I can muster beyond the occasional moments of brilliance of which there are many) is that it's ""mostly harmless"".",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition
565971,"Somehow it's difficult to say anything useful about this film. It is so well made, so well told, that it leaves me merely with a sense of completeness. There is no real ""plot"", and it is senseless to give a pedestrian outline of what does or does not happen. I must have seen it when it came out, perhaps about 1977, and have not been able to forget it. It is, somehow, a perfectly made presentation of one man's life: insignificant yet universal, simultaneously realistic, surrealistic, artistic, fantastic, true yet imaginative. I was staggered to see that an apparently bone-headed remake by Blake Edwards, a clumsy and insensitive film-maker --- think of what a misuse of Peter Sellers' talents the Pink Panther series was! --- had attempted either to spoof it, or to exploit it. Well, I haven't seen his remake, but I can imagine it as the crudest possible American bludgeoning of French finesse. This masterpiece by Truffaut is an utterly fascinating account of the enigma of the male-female human relationship --- far, far superior in its own terms to anything produced in the English-speaking world.",N/A

275736,"If your knowledge of ""42nd Street"" comes from seeing the stage musical, you'll be surprised to find how much less of a musical the film actually is, and how much darker it is than its stage counterpart. The spectre of the Great Depression pervades every frame of the film. These Broadway hoofers never once look like they're enjoying themselves; instead, they look like any other group of factory or assembly workers, desperately holding on to the job they have no matter how miserable it may be.Busby Berkeley's groundbreaking choreography bursts on to the screen late in the film in a couple of dazzling production numbers. Though actually there is something disturbing about his obsession (and the entire film's obsession) with objectifying women until they are nearly indistinguishable from one another. To the producers of the musical within the film, the women are nothing more than pairs of legs. In the audition scene we are privy to, they select the chorus by asking them to hike up their skirts so that their legs will be more easily visible!! If there are any auditions to actually find out if the women can sing or dance, we don't see them. And again, in Berkeley's dance numbers, the women become little more than individual body parts, swirling around in kaleidoscopic images that blur one into the next.These early Depression-era musicals are known for launching the career of Ruby Keeler, but I was quite taken aback by how awful she is. She can't act, and her dancing is atrocious. She clomps around and flails her arms like a chimpanzee impersonating a human. Of the actors, Ginger Rogers makes an impression in a small role as the acerbic Anytime Annie (and get a load of the scene where she insists that Ruby Keeler take on the lead role in the musical, because she can dance rings around poor Ginger....yeah, right). Bebe Daniels and George Brent do well with their parts, and Warner Baxter serves up the ham and gets to deliver the film's most famous line.I know this review sounds more critical than positive, but I actually enjoyed this film very much. It's corny, silly and melodramatic to be sure, but it's also earnest and well crafted. It's a fascinating slice of film history and one that any serious film buff should see.Grade: A-",42nd Street VHS
325244,"Since Thomas Edison's invention of the modern cinema, countless filmmakers have endeavored to produce a moving picture that accurately chronicles the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth. Aside from Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, which chronicled only a part of the life and crucifixion of Jesus, Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth is the greatest of all. Originally aired as a television mini-series (it's over six hours in length), the film closely adheres to the word-for-word accounts found in the Gospels.The story begins with Joseph (Yorgo Voyagis) and Mary's (Olivia Hussey) reception of God's angels. Each is told of the child that Mary will bear and what his name will be. The scene where Mary receives her message is an especially powerful piece of cinematic artistry with no dialogue - only a warm light surrounding Mary as she bows in prayer. The film holds true to every utterance in the Gospels, recounting the census, Herod's decree, and the travels of Joseph and Mary.As Jesus (Robert Powell) develops into adulthood, we witness the beginning of his ministry. He calls on his disciples, teaches through use of parables, and displays many miracles. Zeffirelli makes powerful use of the camera by having his star, Powell, never be caught blinking in any scene. At first, it's barely noticeable, and it takes some time to figure out what is so different. But this absence of the uniformly common trait of blinking creates a divine aura around the character of Jesus. It draws in the audience by creating an emotional sense of peace that lends credibility to the onscreen portrayal of Jesus.From beginning to end, Jesus of Nazareth offers a plethora of memorable scenes and exchanges which are more attributable to the Gospels and the actual life of Jesus rather than brilliant direction and acting ability. But the subject matter is aptly handled by a great production team and an endless array of first-rate actors and actresses, among them are - Mary Magdalene (Anne Bancroft), the Centurion (Ernest Borgnine), Simon Peter (James Farentino), Balthazar (James Earl Jones), Joseph of Arimathea (James Mason), Nicodemus (Laurence Olivier), Caiaphas (Anthony Quinn), and many others... Overall, the individual performances come together to form a rich tapestry of wisdom and intrigue that will leave its audience with much upon which to reflect and ponder. If you believe Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah (which this author does), then Jesus of Nazareth serves as a form of meditation and renewal of one's spiritual connection to God. But if you don't view Jesus in this way, no other film will leave you in such awe of the profound influence promulgated by a humble, sandal-clan man from a province on the outskirts of mighty Rome - an influence that has completely dominated the world for almost two thousand years to the present day.For spiritual, philosophical, and cinematic reasons, Jesus of Nazareth is a definite must-see film for the ages...The DVD Report",N/A
933155,"Director Gregg Araki's adaptation of Scott Heim's novel about child abuse is entirely true to the novel.  In fact, having just read the novel before seeing the movie, I could predict every on-screen action, and the movie just became a vivid and larger-than-life version of the haunting elements of the novel.  Every character was true to the novel, and the plot barely diverged from the novel's action.  Would I have enjoyed this without reading the novel?  I think I might have been a little confused about all the hype, because it was the novel truly brought home the real-life impacts and emotions surrounding child sexual abuse.  Brian was a much stronger character in the novel, and came across as ridiculously innocent and confused in the movie.  Neil, on the other hand, was strengthened by his on-screen portrayal, because his conflicted emotions over his hustling behavior were really driven home by Joseph's Gordon-Levitt's acting.",Mysterious Skin
625716,"This movie centres on digital effects and considerable noise. There is the ghost of a story here and, like a ghost, appears unexpectedly at times but, again like a ghost, is difficult to see and vanishes quickly.The movie holds your attention to a degree but in the way a series of explosions do. One goes off, then another then ... there's a pause, and then another. So when they stop you wait for the next one because you know it will happen shortly.I suppose my biggest problem with the film is the digital look. It is so excessive you want to tear your hair out. The actors look like people lost in a Twilight Zone episode where they've found themselves in a huge video game.As for the characters, it's fitting that James Cromwell plays a character who is seen only as a holographic image - something with no depth. This is pretty much what every character is.It's hard to fault the actors given what they have to work with. In fact, Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin is quite good and effective given the little room she has to actually act. But she's about the only one.For instance, there is the movie's star, Will Smith as Del Spooner . He appears to have phoned in his performance. But to be fair he has to spend the majority of his time being an action figure. But riding motorcycles and jumping from ledges is not acting. As an actor in I, Robot, he's a great stunt man.The sad thing about this movie is that there actually are the seeds of a pretty good story here.

356593,"""Call Northside 777"" is based on the true story of Joseph Machek and Theodore Marcinkovitz, who were wrongly convicted of the Prohibition-era murder of a police officer, and the ""Chicago Times"" newspapermen, reporter James P. McGuire and copywriter Jack McPhail, whose investigative reporting exposed the miscarriage of justice. The film was made in the documentary style that gained popularity in the late 1940s, with sparse, omniscient voiceover narration, non-professional actors in small roles, and even occasional documentary footage. It was filmed on location in Chicago and in the Illinois State Penitentiary. Names have been changed, and the ""Chicago Times"" journalists have been merged into one composite character. ""Call Northside 777"" is sometimes called documentary-noir or newspaper-noir, but it doesn't possess the cynicism or corrosive noir environment of the hard-hitting ""T-Men"", which was also based on a true story. ""T-Men"" is more noir, while ""Call Northside 777"" is more neo-realist. But this is top-notch docudrama and late-40s-style ""social conscious"" filmmaking that honors crusaders against injustice.In the Polish district of Chicago, December 1932, a police officer is shot to death by two masked gunmen in the storefront of a speakeasy owned by  Wanda Skutnik (Betty Garde). Police suspect a patron of the establishment named Tomek Zaleska (George Tyre). They arrest his friends, Helen and Frank Wiecek, at whose home he spent the night of the crime. Frank (Richard Conte) and Tomek protest their innocence, but both are convicted of the crime on the testimony of Wanda Skutnik and sentenced to 99 years behind bars. In 1944, eleven years after the conviction, Frank's mother, Tillie Wiecek (Kasia Orzazewski), advertises a reward of $5,000 for the identity of the real killers. ""Chicago Times"" city editor Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb) asks his reporter Jim McNeal (Jimmy Stewart) to investigate the unusual advertisement and pushes a skeptical McNeal to pursue the story of Frank's case and possible innocence.""Call Northside 777"" -which is the telephone number in Tillie Wiecek's ad, by the way- was Jimmy Stewart's first hardened or cynical role, as he began to get away from the boy-next-door charm of his earlier roles. Jim McNeal is a blunt, distrustful man, who is out for his own interests. He isn't always a nice guy, and he isn't sympathetic at first. Jimmy Stewart could play obsessive and intractable as well as anyone. And he could create a sense of downhome, common sense righteousness better than anyone. Much of ""Call Northside 777""'s success rests on his ability to do both here. At 1 hour and 51 minutes, this was a long movie for its time, but it moves along at a nice clip. There is a bit of technophilia that is so often present in post-war films, as we anxiously await photostats that have been sent over a wire service. Photostats have rarely been so fascinating. ""Call Northside 777"" is terrific docudrama whose story, style, and performances hold up very well.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): ""Fox Movietone News"" is a one-minute newsreel of the film's 1949 premiere. There are theatrical trailers for this film (2 minutes) and 4 other films. The audio commentary by film noir theorists and authors James Ursini and Alain Silver is very worthwhile. They provide scene-by-scene commentary on visual and narrative style, characters, actors, discuss the roots of the documentary style, and compare the film to the real case on which it is based.

Millions (dare I say billions?) of kids have grown-up watching Scooby-Doo and I was one of them. While these episodes from the 1960's and 1970's look and feel dated they are still perfectly acceptable and the overall fun of the show is not lessened.The episodes are as follows.Season 1What a Night for a Knight (1969)A Clue for Scooby Doo (1969)Hassle in the Castle (1969)Mine Your Own Business (1969)Decoy for a Dognapper (1969)What the Hex Going On?

(1970)Don't Fool with a Phantom (1970)Season 2 is slightly better thanks to the inclusion of one really 70's Danny Janssen song per episode. They are actually quite pleasant, easy-listening songs and it gives the Season 2 episodes a higher nostalgic feel.Of course all 25 episodes adhere to the strict formula the franchise would soon find it increasingly hard to break away from (and end-up resorting to self-parody instead). Each episode will see the gang going about their ordinary lives before getting involved in a monster mystery. The suspects will all be introduced within 5 minutes. The gang will try to trap the monster but Shaggy and Scooby will screw up and fall into the trap instead. Through sheer luck the monster will be caught and unmasked. The criminal motivations will either be revenge, smugglers dressed up to scare away intruders or townsfolks dressed up to attract tourists. It is very hard to come across a Scooby-Doo episode from any season that doesn't flow this way. But, to be honest, towards the end of the second season the writers did try very hard to put a new spin on things and keep it fresh.What I like best about the old school Scooby animation is the rustic feel to the backgrounds and settings. The spookyness is painted on in deep purples and blues and makes for surprisingly atmospheric looking environments. While the slick modern nature of the What's New Scooby-Doo TV show is pleasing to the eye there's just something more and better about the old look.Most of the classic Scooby villains are in here (most of them appearing in Scooby Doo 2) and I strongly suggest that all Scooby-Doo fans buy this box set if they don't have it already. The DVD actually contains some great extras including a cool featurette on Scooby collectors (I must admit I am beaten a zillion times over compared to these guys). Some extras are still fluff tho.The episodes are presented in 1.33:1 full frame, as originally drawn, with Dolby Mono sound. The quality between them is fairly average with age only marring it occasionally. Still though, you must have!","Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete First and Second Seasons"

And upon inspection of the credits etc.. and saw it was made in 1984! The cover made it look like a modern day movie, but i'm glad i finally go tto see it.Top secret is typical Zucker/Abraham humour like there other films, Airplane(flying high), Naked Gun & Kentucky Fried Movie. This one however may not be the funniest movie they have done, but it is the funniest movie about a rocker from America who goes to Germany to be the first ever rocker allowed to perform in the country, but ends up tangled up with a woman who is the head of the underground rebellion and there misshap adventures continue from there.What I really liked about the film was how it was shot in 84, yet it looks like a huge hollywood blockbuster from the 50's or 60's. Huge stages and looks very 'classic' in it's appearence. It really is a wonderull job in shooting it and the scenery and backgrounds are very nice... and thats coming from someone who never gives a s#!~ abou tthat kind of stuff!!!! IMO it deserves an award for it, you just dont see those kind of things anymore these days.Overall, the comedy is definitly there. It is funny, whacky and crazy as you expect from the Z-Z-A trio.

They said the movie did nothing when it was released but has done well in the rental market! They say it's 'cause you can fast forward the slow bits and get to the interesting part and watch a 30 minute movie... nah, i thought it paced ok, so i dunno what there on about it. it probably just went up against something else that took all the focus off this one.Overall, it's a great film for what it is.

Soon, a ""non-fiction"" novel of their story came out.  The Lutz's made the rounds of less picky talk shows and basically, a huge urban legend sprung up.  Their story was TRUE!!  (Of course, it was all a hoax, but who cares about that!).  Then a movie came out, and everyone was all in an uproar over the walls that bled!  Cool!!!  But the movie, with James Brolin and Margot Kidder was schlock then and it's certainly dreadful now.Then here comes a remake that doesn't even bring the zeitgeist of the original with it.  We take it as pure fiction right from the get-go, despite the title card stating ""Based on a True Story.""  Yep, it truly is a story alright.The thrills are predictable in the extreme.  Most of them are heralded with a burst of loud music.  Over and over.  Now, I will grant you that horror movies have been doing this for years...but this movie makes the most of the device.  It accompanies EVERYTHING that might be even remotely creepy.  LOUD NOISE=HUGE THRILL!!! Right??Wrong.  In one scene, the father (played by a bushy faced Ryan Reynolds...designed to make him look like the bearded James Brolin from the original) is watching some home movies.  He smiles.  Suddenly, one of the kids' faces briefly turns demonic, right on the film.  LOUD, LOUD BLAST OF SOUND!!  I just about had to laugh.  This wasn't scary at all.  The kid wasn't going to come out of the film and attack the father. It was just a weird little thing that would have been more effective with quiet music or none at all.  But no, why be subtle when a SLEDGEHAMMER OF SOUND is readily available.  Thus, the movie renders all its thrills equal.  There's really no sense of climax.  Right near the end, something horrible happens to a major character, and we actually think, ""Cool, the movie is daring enough to surprise us in this way.""  Nope, it was just a dream.Also horrific is the fact that the wonderfully talented Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights) plays the local priest as though a gun were being held to his head.  I assume he got a nice paycheck, or maybe did it on a bet or a dare, but he sure looks unhappy to be in this film.I give the film 2 stars, because I reserve 1 star reviews for the true dregs of the earth like FEAR DOT COM or THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.  But this movie is just clumsy, unexciting and UNTHRILLING.  As for the R rating?  Well, one ""F"" bomb is dropped, and there are some disturbing images when we discover what REALLY happened on the land the house was built on.  Mind you, I said disturbing.  But not scary.  So, I don't recommend the movie for kids...or anyone else, for that matter!",The Amityville Horror

This movie definitely is one of Studio Ghibli's best, for it's wit and humor.The Disney English dub sees to it that you're not dissapointed, with an excellent voice casting, with the likes of Anne Hathaway, Cary Elwes, Peter Boyle, Tim Curry and Elliott Gould. Each of them brings fun and charm to their characters, sounding like they had fun in the process. The characters themesleves are awesome, Baron being the coolest out of them all in this feature. They're all so charming that they're hard not to like.If you love Kiki's Delivery Service (like I do) you'll love this little underappreciated gem. A great addition to your DVD library.",N/A
874844,"After a few years of disappointing Asian movies, this movie gets it right. This Korean film, Tae Guk Gi, tells a story of two brothers thrust into a war they care little about. Over time one embraces the brutality of war, while the other fights against it. In the name of love the warrior fights brutally. But, in the movie's central point, this brutality overcomes good intentions. The other brother must wage his own war against the depravity of war that is destroying his brother.The last few years have seen an influx of Asian movies hit the scene here in the States. Most have been disappointing and most get lost in their own beauty. Tae Guk Gi is very beautiful and its imagery is amazing. But the story keeps true to its theme. This is well worth the time, and is a gripping portrait of war.",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War
78786,"Pocahontas was the 1995 follow up to Disney's blockbuster success of The Lion King. Although it didn't manage to even gross half of what TLK did, it managed to pull in over $141 million domestically, which is quite respectable. Many don't care for it because of its historical inaccuracies. For a while as of late, I did push it aside and thought that I no longer cared for it like I did. However, when Disney announced a 10th Anniversary 2-Disc DVD, featuring a new extended version of the film with the previously and wrongfully deleted If I Never Knew You song, I decided to get it and gained an all new appreciation for the film, its themes, and its visual beauty...an appreciation I never had at 12 when I first saw it.The transfer is much better than the Gold Collection DVD, which was riddled with grain and softness. There's not a speck of grain or any other video flaws. Audio is excellent. It's kind of hard to believe Pocahontas is 10 years old. And the film finally feels complete now that If I Never Knew You has been restored into the film.While not as packed as a Platinum Edition, this DVD is thankfully void of the countless games (Instead, only one game is included here.) and cheesy pop remake videos and gets down to the MEATY stuff. The two videos for the pop songs heard during the end credits ARE here, however, but they all provide nostalgic fun while looking at videos riddled with mid-90's video cliches. Nostalgic fun. Also included is a 28-minute making-of docu produced in 1995 for the Disney Channel. It also includes cliched mid-90's touches. Nostalgic fun, yet again. It's also surprisingly not completely fluffy. Also included are various featurettes on the premiere, the making of the If I Never Knew You scene, and the music, as well as an early presentation reel featuring an early demo of Colors Of The Wind, deleted scenes, and theatrical trailers.For a non-Platinum disc of a more overlooked film, Disney has certainly given Pocahontas an awesome DVD treatment, complete with a deleted song. I definitely recommend it, and I hope Disney does something similar in 2006 for the 10th Anniversary of another cruelly overlooked classic, The Hunchback Of Notre Dame.",N/A
319287,"Not to be confused with the 2005 Uwe Boll film of the same name (of which I haven't seen yet, but heard nothing but bad things about), Alone in the Dark (1982) is a wonderful little nugget of cinematic nastiness that came out in the early 80s, unfairly lost in a morass of mediocre slasher films that were so very popular at the time.  While it does have many of the trappings of movies within that genre, escaped psychopaths, sharp implements of death, a big, old house, a family in terror, it doesn't really fit within the genre as it has some things a lot of those films didn't, like an interesting story, strong script, and a talented and experienced cast.  Co-written and directed by Jack Sholder (A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge, The Hidden), the film features Jack Palance and Martin Landau, both of whom would later to go on to win Academy Awards for their roles in the films City Slickers (1991) and Ed Wood (1994), respectively.  Also appearing is Donald Pleasence (Halloween, Escape from New York), Dwight `""Howling Mad"" Murdock' Schultz  (""The A-Team"", Fat Man and Little Boy), accomplish opera performer Erland van Lidth (Stir Crazy, The Running Man), Deborah Hedwall (""As the World Turns""), Lee Taylor-Allan (Stargate), Phillip Clark (""Another World""), Brent Jennings (Witness, Red Heat), and Carol Levy (The Princess and the Call Girl), as Bunky, the ill fated babysitter with the nice rack.After an entirely bizarre sequence that would make any male viewer cringe, we see Dr. Dan Potter (Schultz) arriving at a nut farm known as `The Haven'.  Apparently it's his first day, and he and his family have just recently re-located within the area so that Dan could accept the position.  Run by an oddball named Dr. Leo Bain (Pleasence), Haven isn't your typical loony bin, as the patients aren't called `patients', but voyagers, each `exploring their own space', as Bain would put it...yeah, ok...anyway, the Haven features pretty much your run-of-the-mill nuts, except for those housed on the third floor.  These are the more dangerous ones, kept in check by a sophisticated security system, which Bain objects to, but the state requires.  There's Frank Hawkes (Palance), a once POW, now fulltime psychotic schizophrenic, Byron Sutcliff (Landau) aka Preacher, a scripture quoting (Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord!), ex-minister who likes to set fires, a 400 pound child lover named Ronald Elster (van Lidth) aka Fatty, and Skaggs, a serial killer better known as `The Bleeder' because of his tendency to get nosebleeds prior to carving up his victims.  After their initial meeting with their new doctor (the previous one left to take another position), the boys on the third floor get it in their heads that Dr. Potter killed their old doctor, and now intends to kill them, so they decide to their only option is to kill him first...and soon get the chance as the sophisticated security system keeping them from escaping has one, major flaw...it only works if the electricity is on...and wouldn't you know it, the town suffers a blackout...oh yeah, the Haven's backup generator conks out (pretty convenient timing, if you ask me).  During the confusion, the boys grab themselves a car, hit the town, arm themselves at the local sporting goods store (looters are running rampant during the power outage), and then head over to the Potter residence...I really did enjoy this film a lot, as it was the first movie I've seen in awhile that actually gave me the creeps, and created a good deal of real suspense.  I have to say, Martin Landau makes an extremely convincing psychopath, with his penetrating glares and huge, toothy, menacing grin.  He sold his character more than anyone else here, and left a lasting impression.  As far as Palance, I've always thought he be a little (okay, a lot) nuts, so playing a role like this probably wasn't much of a reach for him.  I thought he did well, but his screen time and character felt limited and lacking...I suppose this was to be expected, given the film features four homicidal maniacs.  Pleasence was a riot in his role as the unconventional, easy-going, eternally optimistic, touchy feely, weed smoking Dr. Bain...there's one scene, in particular, that highlights this...near the end, Dr, Bain shows up at Potter's house (the crazies have been terrorizing the family during the blackout), learns his `voyagers' are lurking about, and pleads with them to come out so they can `explore a few things together'.  The film has a handful of these comic moments that I enjoyed primarily because I have a sick sense of humor.  As far as Dwight Schultz, I thought he also did pretty well, and it must have been difficult playing against so many accomplished performers.  I did find his character to be a little annoying, the consummate clinician trying to apply his skills in a rational matter even during time of severe danger.  Eventually he does resort to his more primal instincts, ones that we all share.  I really got a strong sense of direction from this film, as tension is thick and almost always there, providing underlying aspect of uncertainty and uneasiness throughout, one of knowing at any moment, something nasty could happen...which is pretty interesting considering this is Sholder directorial debut, as normally one wouldn't expect someone to put a film together as well as he did, but I do believe he started out as an editor, so perhaps he developed an eye for how sequences should play out and fit together as a whole.  The pacing is strong, but really picks up after them men escape, and rarely slows down until the end.  There is a number of little surprises throughout, punctuated by a large one, which I managed to figure out well before it was presented...which, in turn, made me a little proud of myself as I didn't think it was entirely obvious, but, I suspect the average viewer will probably pick up on it as there are a few, well placed clues.  Regardless, even given what I suspected, the reveal was classic and worth waiting for...as far as the ending goes, it was definitely unexpected, but interesting.  Serious gore hounds may be disappointed by the lack of blood, but what this is in the movie is effective...one scene in particular features the brutal disposition of the ward attendant, played by Jennings, during the inmates escape.  All in all a creepy horror thriller, worth checking out if you're interested in something above and beyond the usual slasher picture.Image Entertainment provides a really good-looking widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) print on this DVD release, along with three audio options, Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1, and Dolby Digital 2.0.  As far as special features, there are quite a few including a commentary track with writer/director Jack Sholder, a video interview with Carol Levy (16:28) who plays the character of Bunky, the babysitter, a video interview with New York punk band The Sic F*cks and Adam Rockoff (16:28), who actually perform within the movie, an original theatrical trailer, extensive liner notes written by Fangoria's own Michael Gingold, and an extensive promotional art gallery.Cookieman108",Alone in the Dark VHS

952678,"Who came up with the title ""Kamikaze Girls,"" anyway?  That makes no sense.  It's like calling the ""Indiana Jones"" films ""Guy with a hotdog and bun.""  There's no sound reason for renaming ""Shimotsuma Monogatari"" aka ""Shimotsuma Town's Story.""  It is in no way related to Japanese nationalism or WWII.  That said, this is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen!Kyoko Fukada is such a darling, and she plays her character Momoko with a great detachment which really adds to her wonderful day dream fantasies.  When Ichigo, a yanki-gang member becomes best friends with Momoko, a teen sporting the new fashion craze of Lolita style, the pair embark on a journey to seek out a legendary embroiderer who can fix Ichigo's misspelled kanji (chinese characters) on her jacket.  The two go to Tokyo and their unlikely bond grows into a full fledged friendship.  Momoko soon realizes, after spending most of the film avoiding or complaining about Ichigo's company and antics, how vital Ichigo's friendship really is to her.  When Ichigo's gang is miffed at her lack of loyalty to them...well what can I say, girl power all the way!  This film is a laugh a minute!  And the colors are so saturated, making the visuals all have a pink, green, blue, purple, gloss to the various scenes.  The music by Yoko Kano is genius and fits the popular trends and themes of this movie with equally appealing pop beats!For those who understand Japanese culture, the film is doubly funny with its social commentary and comedic satire.

775408,"Sleep-inducing.  That's 'Gerry,' and I know, some of you like the film still.  But even so, you must admit that you had to try hard to keep your eyes open.  At least, the landscapes are beautiful, but that's not enough for you to be keep awake.What you see is simple: two unnamed guys --  Matt Damon and Casey Affleck -- stray from the marked path somewhere in the wilderness, and wonder the deserted land for three days.  And ... and nothing more.  Surprisingly, according to one interview with Gus Van Sant, this film is loosely based on truth.'Gerry' refuses the traditional rules of films based on our accepted concepts about characters, stories, etc.  So, you should know that to criticize the film according to these ideas is pointless.  Yes, I know very well.  But....Can you really sit through this for more than 100 minutes?  Ask yourself.  Be honest.  Please, tell me.  And I watched it in theatre.  Yes, I confess, I slept during these long, continous scenes that show you two guys walking on and on and on ... and is that worth our money?  OK, let's not talk about money.  That's commercialism.THE problem is, Gus Van Sant denies traditional way of filmmaking -- that's fine in itself -- but  does not show something new, something that can take the place of the good old traditions.  We need something, or anything, in the place of conventional ideas storytelling.  Instead, what we see is, two men wondering on and on, trapped in the land of nowhere.  Existential?  Maybe, but think about that they made (part of) the film on location in Argentina!  Is that worth that trouble?Using the clout he got with 'Good Will Hunting,' Gus Van Sant made a silly remake (or copy) of 'Psycho.'  And he made this, with Matt Damon (why not use some unknown actors. then?).  With all respect to him, he should have learned that some kind of idea is valid only on paper.",Gerry
29960,"'Liberty! The American Revolution' is a wonderful PBS series, a six-part treatment of the period leading up to and including the American Revolution in the mid-to-late 1700s.As this series shows, the seeds of the American Revolution were planted long before the actual conflicts began. This was not an overnight decision on the part ofthe colonists or the British; intense negotiations and political attempts were made for years prior to the outbreak of hostilities. The colonists largely came from Britain; the leadership certainly looked to Britain for political, moral and cultural guidance, as well as primary trade and security vis-a-vis the Spanish, the French, and the Native Americans. American leaders were, by and large, British leaders too -- George Washington held a commission and fought with the British in the French and Indian War.This was a family break-up in many ways -- the series' astute use of the actual words of the people of the time show the emotions that conflict, the love-hate relationship both sides embodied. The first episode shows the beginnings of discontent on both sides, with the colonists beginning to be stressed over being ignored by the British leadership, and the British leadership, in the form of George III, newly ascended to the throne, and various high-powered ministers, feeling that the colonists were rather ungrateful toward their (so-they-considered-themselves-to-be) rightful lords.Liberty, ironically, was what George III and his first minister, William Pitt, were all about. The Seven-Years War was won as a fight for liberty; the colonies in America and elsewhere were won over to Britain, who had a parliamentary democracy (however poorly enacted) as opposed to absolute monarchy (such as in France). So, the break-up between Britain and the American colonies becomes all the more troublesome -- not only were the opposing sides practically family, but largely believed the same things.The series never makes the direct comparison, but one can get the sense of Jonathan Swift here, that the battles are fought over relatively minor things (like which side of the egg to crack) -- in the scheme of world politics then and now, the controversies were relatively slight. However, the issues of taxation, governance and respect were important, not perhaps so much for what they were, but for what they did portend as future treatment, and the colonists did not like being second-class citizens in a British-dominated world, even if, to the British leadership, being second-class British was better than being almost anything else. There was also the spectre of the Irish tyranny, perpetrated by the English, that loomed large as a possibility. Sadly, one cannot say that these fears were unjustified.The series is intriguing, introducing sides to the conflict that one doesn't recall from grade-school and high-school civics classes -- the conflicts among the colonies themselves; the dissent among the colonies who often wanted a repair rather than a break with Britain; and the personal reflections and fears of the founding fathers and mothers (yes, there were many women involved in this process). Using diaries, correspondence, official documents and media reports of the time, the show weaves together a narrative history that achieves a good popular balance between historical detail and narrative reporting.The writers' admiration for the founding Americans, their bravery and their intelligence, is very apparent. Their concern to present the British in a fair and balanced light is also apparent, and often portrayed as trying to be reasonable and responsive to many of the colonial concerns, if not always pleasant and courteous to the colonial leaders themselves. The writing is interesting and thoughtful, and done in a popular tone that gives personality to the people who figure in the events.The final episode looks at the aftermath of the war, and the struggle for unity as a nation. George Washington's statement that liberty could be both a blessing and curse was taken to heart -- when the Constitutional Convention met to amend the Articles of Confederation, it went far beyond its original mandate, and it was telling that not all colonies sent representatives, and not all that were sent agreed to stay through the proceedings.A great series in many ways, it makes a great gift for anyone (or to oneself) with an interest in history.  It also has a companion volume available, which works both as a stand-alone volume or as a supplement.",N/A
273180,"This film is very unique in a lot of ways.Buster Keaton's particular style tends to contain a playfulness involving machinery and nature, and this film is not only no exception, it's more like the actualization of his oevre into an almost final, complete form.The key thing here is the trains.  Keaton loves trains, and indeed this film has more trains than you can shake a stick at... not that you can really shake a stick at a train and expect something to happen, but you get the point.  Anyways, not only does it have a lot of trains, it has a lot more trains than I think any other film (it definitely has more trains than any other film I've seen, that is).  Furthermore, while I have seen other films involving train chases, I've very seldomly seen films involving trains chasing trains... and even the ones I have don't have as many.For that matter, this film seems almost Hollywoodesque in its train-chases and explosions.  Lots of chases, lots of explosions, sounds like Ye Olde Hollywood Fare to me!, only it's like, way before that became typical Hollywood use and it's all tied together specifically by the great Keaton himself.Some people express a little dissatisfaction by the fact that Keaton takes the side of the South.  I don't know particularly why he did that, but what strikes me about this film is how it also takes little pokes of parody at the great Birth of a Nation.  Furthermore, his relationship with the girl in this case seems like a pretty good deconstruction of the ol' Southern Belle, and that's pretty funny too.I like this film slightly less than other of Keaton's films because it's epic.  Actually, this makes this film technically at or above the level of Keaton's other films because of the sheer scale of it.  I just like it less because it's slightly less Keaton, and he doesn't have nearly as much space to do what he possibly could.  However, touches of his real hard-hitting humor still come through, like when he is sitting on the piston and the train starts to leave while he stares forlornly into space...  I'm sure we can all recognize the feeling of just having to let ourselves be carried away by the world when it seems there's no hope for love.Thus, I give this film a 5 out of 5 rating for technical superiority, but 4 out of 5 reflects my personal ranking of it in comparison of other films of his I like.  If you like this and haven't seen Sherlock Jr. yet, please see that one as it's my personal favorite.--PolarisDiB",N/A
890223,"Yes, I know the last exclamation mark is a 1This film has taken its place among my top 3 favorite movies, the first 2 being The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the first Pirates of the Carribean movie (they're making a sequel).First, let's talk about the music. The music is brought to the grand scale that Andrew Lloyd Webber had always dreamed of, now that it is being played by a full orchestra and not a pit band.The production design is extraordinary. I was rooting for the art department to win the Oscar for Best Art Direction. The grand scale of the stage show has been elevated to new heights.The treatment of the show itself is excellent. I loved the added touches of backstory and action and mystery. I personally preferred the sword fight in the cemetary because it works better on film than what actually happens on stage (the Phantom throws fireballs.) I also love how Schumacher gave the characters of Madame Giry and Joseph Buquet so much more to do than in the stage version. Frankly, they're just throwaway characters in the stage version but in the movie, we realize what Buquet is all about and we get to see that Madame Giry had a more vital role to play in the Phantom's life.Now for the cast:Emmy Rossum has the voice of an angel and is perfect for the part. She's the right age and has a young, crystalline voice.Gerard Butler as the Phantom. I don't agree that his singing voice is the best in the world. I know he's not really a trained singer but they could have trained him just a tad harder. Then again, Schumacher did not want a pretty voice for the Phantom. So, I forgive him. To tell the truth, his voice isn't that bad.Patrick Wilson has vocal chords made of gold, which is only right since he has done Broadway. He is perfect as the dashing, romantic, swashbuckling, and somewhat wimpy Raoul.Minnie Driver is hysterical as La Carlotta (I 'ATE MY 'AT!!!!)It's a pity that she's not really an opera singer.Miranda Richardson has an ok singing voice. She also puts on a convincing French accent. I've noticed that Madame Giry is normally the only member of the cast who has to do a French accent. She's less of a throwaway in the movie than in the stage version and more of a driving force. We see that she truly cares about Meg and Christine. So when the new managers are checking the two out, she's like, ""Don't even think about it!""Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (pronounced KEE-ran HINDS; long I) are hysterical as the two managers (this never happened in the junk business; scrap metal!)I feel that Simon Callow's singing voice rivals Ciaran Hinds by far.Jennifer Ellison is a little delight as Meg Giry. And she's the first Meg I've ever heard who can sing. She's so petite and adorable that I thought Kristen Chenoweth was playing the part!Victor McGuire as Piangi is wonderfully hammy and henpecked. He has a wonderfully exaggerated tenor which gets crappy in all the right places. (Sad to return to find the la-a-a-and we love).I still don't understand why that midget was there all the time.Kevin McNally as Buquet. Well, he's better than the stage Buquet, who was a total throwaway character. At least he has more to do (like trying to catch the Ballet Girls getting dressed)The makeup on the Phantom was somewhat of a let down. It looked more like he had an encounter with acid as a young child. Then again, in the movie, it's never established that he was deformed from birth, so that may be what happened.The guy who played Monsuier Reyer was also funny (UNDERSTUDY!? There is no understudy for La Carlotta!)Just for the record, the horse in the title song is a homage to the original novel. The Phantom takes Christine to his lair on a horse.And now the special features:The featurette on the history of the musical was really cool. I especially liked the film clips of the Sydmonton production, the current production in England and clips from the music videos (the British DVD has the full, unedited music videos. Lucky dogs! Oh, well, they've had this show and Andrew Lloyd Webber longer.)The deleted song, No One Would Listen, is lovely even if it is really the first draft of Learn to Be Lonely.It's an awesome film and if the upcoming movie versions of Rent, The Producers, and Dreamgirls once again kill the movie musical which has barely been resurrected by Chicago and Moulin Rouge, this will be a reminder that this generation had its share of movie musicals. What can I say? I'm a sucker for movie musicals. I even liked Man of La Mancha.",N/A

The beginning and middle are great--Aish Rai is amazing, clearly, one of the loveliest women to ever walk the earth. Graceful and just stunning.

For me at least, I find this movie to be quiet, somewhat symbolic of something, and just stylish. It is stylish in a way that's not flashy, but trendy and artsy. I think it's hard to explain. I thought there was decent acting, but I don't feel that the actors were given much to do really. You do end up seeing a lot of nice scenes and images in Japan which I can appreciate. It is set in modern day Japan and you have Bill Murray and Scarlett J staring as the main actors...they end up forming a friendship (which I thought was going to turn into something more). You also see Anna Faris (Cindy fron Scary Movie) in kind of the same bubbly spirit.I gave this movie 2 stars but I'd like to really give it 2 1/2 because of the picture and color of it and its style. Other than that, I did not like it. If you tend to like movies like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Equilibrium and things like that, you will most likely not like this film. If you like Tom Hanks kind of films, this is probably right up your alley.",Lost in Translation
851438,"This was a good attempt.  It was probably more historically accurate than any of the plethora of other Arthurian works on film.  I have no complaint concerning the quality thespianism demonstrated here.  The direction was excellent, the photography was wonderful, and I even managed to appreciate the camera angles, CGI used in fog creation, etc.I don't know about anyone else, but I -like- Magick in my mythology.  Magick is in all mythology; even christian.  It's called something else, of course, but it's all Magick, just the same.While I enjoyed this attempt, it just was not the Legend of King Arthur I embrace.  The Magick and mysticism are gone from it, and it lost all attraction for me.  It felt like watching Spiderman with no powers, or Superman when he couldn't fly.  It completely failed to capture imagination due to its having none of its own.If you felt like I did, I highly recommend John Boorman's ""Excalibur.""  That was a magickal endeavor in the name of King Arthur.",King Arthur
821116,"Johnny Depp, the greatest actor in modern cinema, transforms from the brillaint scalliwag Jack Sparrow into the secluded writer Mort Rainey in this adaptation of Stephen King's short story.  This film garnered mixed reviews throughout 2004, but after seeing it, I have no idea why.  From start to finish, Depp's performance intrigues, from the ridiculous attire he wears at home to the cynical comments he makes to others.  The plot, as would be expected from a Stephen King story, is well crafted, and it builds progressively from start to finish.  In the end, the viewer is satisfied by a sweet, dark ending that Stephen King is so renowned for creating.  Secret Window was probably the most overlooked great film that 2004 had to offer.",N/A
838179,"I know Paramount had promised us that we'd get the uncut versions of the ""Friday the 13th"" series months before they released this boxed-set on DVD and considering the fact that these are only the original R-rated cuts, a fair amount of fans were left disappointed. However, this is NOT as bad a deal as many people are making it out to be. After all, we DO still get all eight movies on four disks (two movies per disk), plenty of blood and gore [that would even satisfy the most hardcore gore-hound], and of course the main feature: JASON HIMSELF!! Here's a[n] short overview for all the movies included here:DISK ONE: ""FRIDAY THE 13TH"" PARTS I & IIPART I (1980, Run time: 95 minutes, Rated R)The one that started it all! In 1958, strange events begin to occur at the Camp Crystal Lake resort: a young boy drowns in the lake and two camp counselors are brutally murdered! 20 years later, the campsite is re-opened by a new generation of camp counselors. From there, we witness some of the most shocking (not to mention creative) death sequences ever caught on camera as they are all picked off one by one by an unseen killer!OVERALL: *****One of the BEST in the F13 series! It was also the movie that helped launch Kevin Bacon's movie career. (Who can ever forget the arrowhead through the throat scene?) The acting is also very well done, especially by actress Adrienne King, and the dark and disturbing atmosphere proves to be quite effective for a low-budget classic!PART II (1981, Run time: 86 minutes, Rated R)Once again, a new group of camp counselors experience a horrifying fate five years after the murders at Camp Crystal Lake. Relocated to a different campsite (but coincidently on the same lake), the carnage continues as a new killer lurks deep in the woods!OVERALL: ****Not as good as the original, but still packs plenty of scares! Such stars as Amy Steel and Paul Holt give pretty convincing performances, though they cannot hold a candle next to Adrienne King. This is also the first F13 to introduce us to everyone's favorite hockey-masked psycho, Jason Voorhees!DISK 2: ""FRIDAY THE 13TH"" Parts III & IVPART III (1982, Run time: 96 minutes, Rated R)Originally released as a 3-D feature in theaters, the DVD version [disappointingly] is only FLAT! Aside from this, the third installment is worth a look! Yet another set of camp counselors take a holiday at Camp Crystal Lake, but fall prey to the unstoppable killer known as Jason! This time, YOU are the victim!*****In my opinion, this is where everything really started picking up. It's also the movie where Jason first receives his hockey mask! Despite some so-so acting (e.g. Dana Kimmell's performance) and cheesy special effects, it is still an eye-popping (literally) thrill-ride! The musical score is also SUPERB!PART IV: THE FINAL CHAPTER (1984, Run time: 90 minutes, Rated R)After the events portrayed in Part 3, Jason's corpse is brought back to life and escapes from the town morgue! Elsewhere, a group of sex-crazed teens are on their way to the familiar Crystal Lake resort, but soon come face to face with the indestructible psycho! One by one, they meet some of the most shocking and twisted fate[s] yet! Now, it's up to whiz-kid, Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) a young boy with a talent for making monster masks and makeup. Has Jason finally met his match?OVERALL: *****Considered to be a favorite among fans, which is not hard to understand why. The acting is good, the atmosphere is nice and creepy, and the gore effects are some of the greatest ever used in a horror film! (Kudos to makeup artist, Tom Savini) In addition, some of the BEST death sequences are executed well in this one! (The face-crushing shower scene is guaranteed to make you cringe) Of course, as we all know, this is NOT the 'Final' Friday!DISK 3: ""Friday the 13th"" Parts V & VIPart V: A NEW BEGINNING (1985, Run time: 92 minutes, Rated R)In this follow-up to `The Final Chapter, Tommy Jarvis (this time, played by John Shepherd) is all grown up and still traumatized by his experience as a child after brutally slaying the hockey masked murderer, Jason Voorhees! Although Jason is now believed to be dead, Tommy continues to be haunted by disturbing visions and fears that he is still alive and out there! It's seems to be his imagination at first, but it soon becomes reality! Jason's back, and this time he's after the troubled youths of an old country mental institute. But could this truly be the killer who everyone suspects, or is there something more to the story?OVERALL: ***Many fans claim this one to be the weakest in the series, which can be understandable. The script is a little silly and uneven at times, the acting is so-so (as with Part 2 & 3), and it isn't as scary as its previous titles. Still, it is quite interesting and worth a look, despite the so-called ""imposter"" twist at the end.PART VI: JASON LIVES (1986, Run time: 87 minutes, Rated R)One dark and stormy night, Tommy Jarvis (now played by Thom Mathews) drives down the road with an old friend in order to discover for himself if the legendary killer, Jason Voorhees is really dead. But after digging up the rotting corpse, lightning strikes the ground and instantly Jason is revived from his grave and escapes the cemetery! Now, more victims fall prey to the machete-wielding maniac and returns to where all the mayhem began at Camp Crystal Lake! (Re-named ""Camp Forest Green"") It's a race against time, as Tommy must put Jason back in his place, or die trying!OVERALL: ****While not exactly the best in the series, this is another favorite among fans. Compared to the previous installments, this is where things REALLY start to get campy! The acting is fine, the atmosphere is still scary, and the gore effects are still terrific! An improvement over Part 5!DISK 4: ""Friday the 13th"" Parts VII & VIIIPART VII: THE NEW BLOOD (1988, Run time: 88 minutes, Rated R)When a young psychic girl named Tina Shepard (Lar Park-Lincoln) and her widowed mother move back to their old home (which is ironically near Camp Crystal Lake) she accidentally frees Jason from his watery grave with her gift and the body count continues. Finally, Tina and Jason duke it out in an electrifying array of special effects and explosive entertainment!OVERALL: *****Another great entry to the series! Personally, this is one of my favorites and it's worth a watch just for the `Carrie VS. Jason' Plot alone. `The New Blood' may not be your usual `Friday' film, but for those who are looking for something different this time around rather than the usual find-the-counselor-and-kill routine will NOT be disappointed! The acting is dull, and the script is cheesy, but Jason is much stronger than he used to be this time around! It's also the first `Friday' that stars Kane Hodder as everyone's favorite hockey-masked killer!PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN (1989, Run time: 100 minutes, Rated R)The last `Friday' film included in this boxed-set finds Jason leaving good ol' Camp Crystal Lake and stalking a group of High School graduates who are on their way aboard a luxury cruise to Manhattan! Now, Jason is painting the town red (literally), as he chases the teens through the mean streets of New York, tearing apart anyone who stands in his way! Can the masked psycho be stopped for good this time?!OVERALL: ****Not bad, though not too good either. The concept of Jason in the Big Apple is actually very interesting and fun to watch! As with Part 7, this one is also quite campy at times with the acting and script. However, there are even more awesome death scenes thrown in for your viewing pleasure! (The uppercut-and-decapitation-to-the-head scene is priceless!) Though not the last, it was followed by box-office flop, ""Jason Goes to Hell"" in 1993!BONUS DISK (Not Rated)Here we have a showcase of the special features for ALL eight of the movies:1. ""THE FRIDAY THE 13TH CHRONICLES - 8-PART FEATURETTE""Spanning through all eight films, with cast and crew interviews (including Betsy Palmer and gore-effects wizard, Tom Savini) behind the popular horror franchise!2. ""SECRETS GALORE BEHIND THE GORE - 3-PART FEATURETTE""A look behind the death sequences used in the movies with never-before-seen footage, drawings, and still photos that highlight the legacy of Jason Voorhees!3. ""CRYSTAL LAKE VICTIMS TELL ALL!""Interviews with cast members from all the different films who explain their death scenes and how they feel with being stalked by Mr. Voorhees on camera!4. ""TALES FROM THE CUTTING ROOM""This is the feature many fans have been screaming for: Uncut footage from some of the films that reveal even more blood curdling shock with Jason dispatching his victims (such as a longer death scene from Part I with Kevin Bacon) and rare, alternative scenes! This should appeal to ANY `Friday' fan!5. ""FRIDAY ARTIFACTS AND COLLECTIBLES""Many different props and collectibles from the films set on display at a convention for the fans.6. ""SCARY TRAILERS""Includes ALL of the theatrical trailers for Parts I-VIII!And there you have it!Indeed, this is a very good collection from the classic 80s slasher genre! Yes, it IS a bit of a letdown that we did not receive the uncut versions, but it's actually quite understandable, considering the fact that the deleted scenes' quality (seen in the `Cutting Room' feature) are kind of poor, while some of the other movies' footage is probably missing as well, or cannot be restored at all! Still, you gotta give credit where credit is due, and I say that the people at Paramount tried their best to bring us this Ultimate DVD set! With that in mind, these movies are fun and original and are worth watching again and again by all horror fans, young and old!",N/A

It's just a classic. This season is filled with great stories and wonderful action.In addition to the wonderful episodes the box set also has some great interviews. Being a mega fan I would have loved to have seen more interviews, but I'm grateful to have what was given to us.I recommend this set to everyone willing and able to purchase it!",Xena Warrior Princess - Season Six
898208,"As a Seagal fan I have to say that this direct-to-toilet DVD ranks high on my all-time worst film list. Seagal started getting pretty bad when he released The Patriot. Between that horrible film and Submerged Seagal has released a few decent direct-to-video films. Submerged is not one of them. The sound quality on Submerged was awful.  It's bad enough trying to understand what Seagal says with his mumbling (or the dubbing), but my wife and I found ourselves turning the volume up and down depending on the scene. While you don't really buy these films for the plot, you expect at least a minimal storyline...not with Submerged! We gave up on Submerged less than 15 minutes into the film. Unless your a Seagal fan and feel the overwhelming compulsion to add to your collection, do not buy this DVD!!! If you're not a fan, don't even bother renting (or borrowing from a friend)!",N/A
47591,"I have to say that I am not familiar with any of the Shadow's comics, games or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" the Shadow prior to the film I have to say that the movie was really good!Needless to say, Alec Baldwin, Tim Curry, Ian McKellen, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!The only setbacks are in relation to not providing enough background on the character in the movie, and the reason why the Shadow has to laugh (so annoyingly) before making an appearance.The plot, the setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie worth watching!",N/A
512287,"""Last Broadcast"" was released a full year before the ""Blair Witch Project"" release date, and upon seeing this film, the viewer can only conclude that this film was the source of the ideas behind ""Blair Witch.""  ""Last Broadcast"" is a far better film both technically and artistically. What's amazing is that Last Broadcast was shot for under $500. ""Blair Witch Project"" directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez did one thing  better than ""Last Broadcast"" directors: promote themselves and their film. ""Blair Witch"" directors Sanchez and Myrick knew how to hype their product using an internet campaign and eventually got widespread distribution for ""Blair Witch Project."" Had Stefan Alavos and Lance Weiler possessed that kind of marketing strategy, perhaps ""Last Broadcast"" would have been the sleeper hit movie that came out of nowhere. Unfortunately ""Last Broadcast"" came out of nowhere and stayed in nowhere, but thanks to verenrable cable networks like Sundance and IFC, this remarkable movie can still be seen on television, occasionally.The strength of ""Last Broadcast ""is that it's utterly believable. The characters in the film crew are intelligent (albeit; eccentric tekkies in the marginal subculture of contemporary infotainment television). The young men of the television crew are high tech savvy producers of a public access ""fact or fiction"" type of show. The crew members are a cross section of a generation who readily mastered the digital and internet technology, but ironically, explain the ambiguities of the real world in terms of paranormal science,esoteric rituals,urban legends and X-File conspiracy theories. These are smart men who like agents Scully and Mulder want to beleive that the truth is ""out there.""  Our misguided perception is that the truth is the source of all authority, but the search for truth often ends with a confrontation with a beast hidden beneath the veneer of ""truth.""The acting of the entire cast is so natural and spontaneous that it's hard to believe they aren't real people, unless you know the movie is a hoax. David Seward as the accused killer, resists an opportunity to portray Jim Suerd as an over-the-top caricature of a mass murderer. Instead, Jim Suerd is a brooding self obsessed psychic, not unlike any number of colorful characters and psychic charlatans you might encounter at a New Age seminar or even a Phish concert. Maybe he's manipulating you with his smoke and mirrors magic act, but otherwise Suerd is the sort of entertaining character that inhabits the margins of mainstream America, except for one personality flaw. Suerd takes himself too seriously and exhibits agressive behavior toward those who would ridicule his psychic talents. Prosecutors use Suerd's short-fuse to make a convincing case that he is an out of control lunatic.There are a number of red herrings that the prosecution was unable to resolve: How did Suerd manage to overpower four other people and commit the level of carnage at the crime scene? What happened to the crew member that simply disappeared leaving only a hat at the crime scene? How could Suerd commit the crime when he spent the evening in an internet relay chatroom set up inside his tent? The answer is lies in partially destroyed videotape that is left on the doorstep of the documentary film director. Or is the  answer really in the destoyed video tape, or is the tape just another red herring?...another faked or manipulated document to mask the idenity of the real killer.The final revelation of the truth by the Beard's narrator makes the ending of the movie even more unsettling. The narrator speaks of the nature of evil and how truth can be easily manipulated in the age of reality T.V. Reality is often not what it seems to be and the ""truth"" is elusive and operates under the laws of relativity. As we witness the disclosure of the ""real killer"", the truth is still ambiguous. With so many red herrings, is it possible that the ending is another clever deception by the killer?Perhaps many of the Amazon reviewers missed the subtle point of the ending. Those critics of the ""Last Broadcast"" have said that its ending isn't ""realistic."" The camera angles and wide shots in the last five minutes couldn't have been done by the just one person. That makes complete sense, if you beleive that the killer acted alone. I disagree with the single killer theory; indeed the final scene is compelling evidence of a more sinister scenario....the murderer had one or more accomplices.When I saw the final shot final wide angle camera shot of the narrator in the woods, I concluded that the ""killer"" was simply a pawn being manipulated by the real mastermind of the killings, whose idenity is never disclosed in the film... The actual mastermind of the killings was operating the second camera doing the tight shots, rooftop shots and wide angle shots that would have impossible for the documentarian to film in the last two scenes of the movie. The mastermind was filming his own documentary of the documentary and was cleverly manipulating even the final revelation of the killer by the documentarian! The killer's final coup d'grace is that when he shoots the final scene of his insane and babbling partner in crime, to prove he exploited at least one other person to do his bidding. Perhaps it was shot for the purpose of blackmail, but it's more likely he shot for the footage of as a homage to his own pure evil.So,who was the mastermind in these horrifying murders? Could it be that oddball, lip stick wearing, down-and out soap opera director, Sam Wells, who lurks in the background of the events? His scruffy appearance and bizzare personality make him my candidate for a guru of thrill kill cult.  Or maybe the overly ambitious and genial ""Fact or Fiction"" video editor, Tom Brunt, who disclosed his television career had taken the fast track since the killings? Or was it the the benign and supportive Dr. Dale Worstall, the killer's psychological counselor prior to the killings? His status as a psychologist would certainly benefit from being the treating psychologist to a notorious mass murderer. You can almost see the book deals and movie options coming in for Dr. Dale.The message of the ""Last Broadcast"" is ""trust no one."" In modern America it pays to be skeptical, particularly if someone tells you they have the ""truth.""  The truth is cheap and you can get as many versions of ""truth"", as reflected images in a house of mirrors. If you don't like one person's version of the ""facts"", change the channel, or surf over to a website where someone has an entirely different version of the ""truth"" that you can agree with. The ""truth"" is mediated by spin doctors, checkbook journalism, reality television, ""fact based"" movies, mockumentaries, supressed evidence, cult superstitions, out of context quotations, politcal and moral censors, press agents, rumor and heresay. With the right kind of media coverage, the same people who were gullible enough to beleive the ""weapons of mass destruction"" fantasy, can be convinced that boogeymen like Bigfoot and the New Jersey Devil are coming to get them. After all, a good tyrant always needs a boogeyman to blame everything on. This ultimate deception of tyrants and boggeymen,is they sucessfully convince the entire world that someone else is really the boogeyman.",N/A

249429,"The nice thing about noirs is that they don't have to be about doomed men, traitorous women and a bad fate waiting just around the corner (although many great noirs are). For me, a good Forties noir is about style, almost always centered around crime or a mystery of some sort, with an instantly recognizable look. I Wake Up Screaming is an effective noir, but it also is a romance with a light touch. What keeps it from being just another light weight romantic caper, in my view, is the approach the movie takes to the crime.Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is a good-looking waitress in New York when she's spotted by a sports promoter, Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), who bets two pals he can promote her into becoming a society celebrity. With their good-natured help, he succeeds. But Vicky has an eye for the main chance. After she becomes a well-known name, she cuts a deal for herself for an opportunity in Hollywood. She announces to Frankie and his friends that she's leaving the next day. That night, she's murdered. The police bring in Frankie for questioning. One of the cops, a hulking detective named Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar), is sure Frankie is the killer. Frankie had motive and he had opportunity. All Cornell needs is some firm evidence. The police also bring in Vicky's sister, Jill (Betty Grable), who had been living with Vicky. By questioning her they are able to find some possible holes in Frankie's story, but they eventually have to let Frankie go. It's apparent that Jill may be in love with Frankie, but at first Frankie doesn't realize this. Eventually they team up to try to find the real killer. Dogging them at every step is the looming menace of Ed Cornell, determined to pin the crime on Frankie.I Wake Up Screaming has all the stylistic flourishes of a good noir: Off kilter camera angles, deep shadows, harsh lighting, tight close-ups, smoky interrogation rooms and vivid characters. Frankie's two pals are played by Alan Mobray as a former star actor on the slide down and by Allyn Joslyn as a friendly but somewhat amoral newspaper gossip columnist. Elisha Cook Jr. shows up as a nervous hotel clerk. Laird Cregar, a big, fleshy guy who almost always played above his age (he was only 27 when he made this movie), brings a kind of creepy, relentless sadness to his role. While Betty Grable and Victor Mature were never known as outstanding actors, they both had a great deal of good-natured personality about them. They handle the serious stuff well, but they do a fine job as the amateur sleuths moving from affection to love.One other thing that has always struck me about this film. It seems to me that, for a 1941 mystery noir, it brings a lot of psychological drama to the table. Partly this is through the structure of the film. Particularly in the first third, the story is told through a series of flashbacks bouncing between the interrogation rooms of the police and the recollections of Frankie and then Jill. Then later we get more flashbacks from Frankie's two pals that establish their vulnerabilities as well as making some plot points. During all this there is the growing awareness that something unhealthy is ticking away inside Ed Cornell's head.All in all, this is a first-rate noir, and it combines nice style with a satisfying ending. It's only available on VHS tape, but if you're a fan of film noir I think it's worth getting.",I Wake Up Screaming VHS

442511,"Petty criminals in the American society. They are small, they are vain, they are insignificant. One cheats in bars to give ten dollars and get the change on twenty. One works for a bookmaker and bets heavy sums on outsiders in horse-races to force the odds and make people bet on the horse for nothing, but she becomes greedy and steals some of the money from her boss, who is a lot bigger than she is. A third one is trying to sell fake diamonds to a jeweller to make an easy profit when she is not selling her body for petty sums. And life goes on. But when danger comes up they find out that among them there can be no team spirit, only hate and jealousy. If one needs to get away for a while, she does not hesitate to kill to make her getaway. In such a profession there is no partner. One is entirely alone and against the whole world. That's the psychology of the profession. But Frears goes a little bit further than that and deals with them as a metaphor of society at large, of all those men and women who make a living out of sheer financial speculation. Their interest is to make an easy and fast buck and they do not see their fellow men and women as men and women any more but only as obstacles, at best, and as non-existing collaterals, at worst. A society dominated by such greed can only become dishumanized and rotting from the inside. Life becomes war and death is the most banal thing you can deal with. You kill not to make the other one die, but you kill your would-be partners to escape the claws of the big preybirds in this society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Grifters

795285,"I watched the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" back when I was in college and again when this remake was released in the theaters.  I enjoyed it very much, with its camp horror and constant terror throughout.  It was a very good film, but it's young remake is also up to the task.Though most people who've watched the original will probably find more wrong with this film than folks who didn't(think old Star Wars vs. new Star Wars), this new version is actually pretty good.  It has a likeable young cast who do very good jobs with their roles.  Leatherface, Granny, and the rest of the cannibalistic family are fun to watch as well.  Their interactions with each other are morbidly engaging.  R. Lee Ermey is hysterical as the sheriff.The film is very tense, especially when Jessica Biel realizes that her friends are being murdered and she attempts to save the few that remain.  At one point, Ermey's character takes a sick and twisted turn in one of the most tense-filled scenes in the film.  He forces one of Biel's friends to ""help"" him in the investigation of a suicide by re-enacting it.  Biel does a lot of running and screaming, but it is all very believable and done with good cause(obviously, I'd run too if Leatherface was chasing me).  Also, the camera manages to find Biel's bosom and midriff quite often, especially in close-ups.  We see her running with a dry, tight shirt, a wet shirt(white nonetheless), and a blood-soaked shirt.  It's obvious why we see her in this way, but I'm sure most of the gents in the crowd won't be offended.Overall, I was surprised at how good this film actually was.  I was actually a little tired after the constant, relentless chase scenes in the flick, which means I was really captivated by the action on the screen. It managed to haul me in and keep me interested until the credits rolled.In closing, I highly recommend this remake of a classic.  I do suggest you watch both of them if you haven't, but keep in mind that the original will always be tough to beat.  Give this remake a little breathing room, and you'll quickly find that it is one of the better horror flicks in recent years.",N/A

925661,"NB: As is Amazon's Wont, they've very unhelpfully bundled all the reviews for various editions and formats together.THE DIRECTOR'S CUTKingdom of Heaven was probably my favorite film of last year, and the 194-minute director's cut gives the film more room to breathe, but it won't make converts of the unbelievers. Instead, it's a more leisurely paced version of the film for the faithful who liked the theatrical cut and want to revisit its world and characters in a little more detail. Closer in style and tone to sixties roadshows than Scott's Gladiator, and all the better for it, in many ways it's the richest and most ambitious of the recent batch of epics. It's more of a journey in the extended version, and a bloodier one (the added violence will please the gore hounds), although there are a few moments that tip over into self-indulgence and could have been tightened or omitted entirely.The extended opening allows more character detail, but at the expense of more of Michael Sheen's caricatured greedy priest, now revealed as Balian's brother. Orlando Bloom's limitations are also given a little more room than they had in the theatrical cut, but he certainly never stoops to the lows of Gerard ""I'm wonderful, me"" Butler in Beowulf, Colin Farrell's Alexander or Clive Owen's truly catastrophic non-performance in King Arthur that left that film with a void at its center. Edward Norton's performance as the Leper King suffers a little from using different takes than the theatrical version, and at least one of his expanded scenes is simply longer without really being any better than its equivalent in the shorter version. The real winner in the extra footage stakes is Eva Green, who I think I'm falling in love with and whose part is considerably expanded and much more complex, allowing her a mass of contradictory motives (few of them noble), impulses and emotions that were smoothed away in the theatrical version. The subplot involving her son also helps add more of an emotional charge to Baldwin's death, with the shot of his leprous face no longer gratuitous but essential. In fact, in this version of the film, there are even a couple of genuinely touching sequences.While the added complexity in this cut is more in the characters than in the plot, some of the problems of the theatrical version have been addressed. The shipwreck is just as rushed in this cut as in the theatrical version, but the pacing problems in the astonishingly spectacular siege finale are much improved by the addition of a fairly minimal amount of footage. It no longer seems quite so hurried and there's more of a sense of the human cost after the battle at the Christopher Gate that was lacking in the shorter version by the simple expedient of including characters we briefly get to know among the dead. There IS one massive miscalculation after the siege where a redundant swordfight has been added: not only is it completely ineffective, dwarfed by the sheer scale and weight of what has come before, but it's also unnecessary, winding up a plot point no-one cares about any more and simply underlining the events of the previous scene.It also now comes with added Bill Paterson, which is rarely a bad thing, especially since his brief scene as a compassionate Bishop establishes the incompatibility of fanatical adherence to religious law with the actions of a loving savior that is one of the film's major themes. Although most of the Christian clerics here are transparent hypocrites, they are also counterbalanced by David Thewlis' Knight Hospitaler just as the `good' Muslims are counterbalanced by fanatics as both Saladin and Baldwin have to walk a tightrope with their own people to prevent war.Thanks to a strong script this is easily Scott's best film since Blade Runner. Unlike Gladiator it doesn't feel like it was written on the hoof, and he has enough confidence in the material not to overdo the stylistics at the expense of the storytelling: here the visuals serve the picture, which isn't always the case in his past work. Even John Mathieson, probably the worst cinematographer to ever win an Oscar, finally delivers the goods. CGI is used sparingly and very effectively when it is (none of the poor FX problems that plagued parts of Gladiator here, thankfully). Instead, much of the spectacle is shot for real - not only is it usually cheaper, but it's certainly a lot more impressive to look at.The transfer quality is not as good as on the theatrical version, but it's more than acceptable. The extra features on the 4-disc set are impressive (or what I've seen of them), including a deeply depressed screenwriter mulling over its US failure. Of the additional deleted scenes included as extras, there's nothing that needed to go back into the picture: most are ideas that didn't really work while a couple are just plain silly. The DVD also includes an interesting collection of trailers and TV spots that try to sell it as everything from The Passion of the Christ II in an outrageous piece of false advertising involving adding a ""Don't worry, God is with me"" line of dialog not in the film (particularly ironic considering its Humanist viewpoint and the crisis of faith of its hero), a family movie, an epic adventure, a country and western rock video and a kick-a** heavy metal teen bloodbath: anything to avoid mentioning Muslims or, God forbid, history. Can't think why this didn't take off at the US box-office... Blu-ray buyers get the short end of the stick, though - just a trailer with no other extras carried over.THE TWO-DISC THEATRICAL CUTKingdom of Heaven turns out to be Ridley Scott's best film since Blade Runner, largely because for once his visuals are matched with a pretty good script that doesn't feel like an afterthought. While most critics, aware of the longer director's cut on the horizon, found it rushed, I had no such problem: true, the film has the quickest shipwreck in screen history and the love story quickly disappears (a shame, because Eva Green gives the film a lightness it otherwise lacks), but for the most part it's journey is well told. Nor is it overly politically correct - the Muslims might be more honorable than some of the Crusaders, but that doesn't make them any less ruthless. Its biggest structural problem is the siege finale, which for all the impressive visuals pales besides Orlando's last couple of efforts at the battlements, The Two Towers and Troy, and unfortunately feels rushed and underpowered and ultimately overstylized. We're never in the thick of it, either emotionally or visually.For a film about religious and moral ideals, it's a curiously untriumphant epic dealing with the failure of reason and compromise. Even it's hero's attempts to live a decent life becomes a part of that failure: when offered the chance to save the city from war and get the girl, his knightly code will not allow him, condemning the people of Jerusalem to war. That, and the fact that it's a film about a loser may well be part of the reason for the film's failure to find an audience in America, but it's also one of the things that makes it so interesting. Even though it's full of historical errors, it does encompass the ebb and flow of a state of mind in a point in history surprisingly well.Orlando Bloom is far from disastrous even if he's not quite good enough. He does the grim and serious stuff well, but he doesn't offer much else: there's no light or shade to the performance, just a conscientiousness that isn't exactly wrong for the character but still leaves you hoping for something more as the third act comes along. If he's not exactly two-dimensional, he does at least manage one-and-a-half more dimensions than Clive Owen did in King Arthur and never embarrasses himself as much as Colin Farrell did in parts of Alexander. The supporting cast are mostly on good form, although Edward Norton seems to be doing Anthony Zerbe's leper turn from Papillon as the dying king.The film was shot largely with real extras for all but the largest crowd scenes, which plays real dividends here. Aside from giving you a sense of a world outside the main characters, it also highlights one of the real limitations of CGi extras: their failure to interact with the elements. It doesn't feel like a computer game but a conflict involving real people, which helps ground the story and give it a sense of weight. John Mathieson's photography is infinitely superior to his overpraised work on Gladiator even though he does overdo the dreariness of Europe.Harry Gregson-Williams' score is competent, but it's telling that much of the film needed to be scored with several cues from Graeme Revell's Crow, Marco Beltrani's Blade and, most effectively in the ""Rise a knight"" sequence, Jerry Goldsmith's Valhalla prayer from The 13th Warrior - so don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly wanting to see one of them straight afterwards!Extras on the two-disc version are plentiful and mostly different from those on the four disc director's cut.",N/A
114745,"I bought this movie with great expectations, but was utterly disappointed on how uninspired and flat this movie fell on all fronts.  I'm no feminist, but even considering the unsavory idea of selling your kid to the highest roller left me flabbergasted.  There is no great singing in this movie and and absolutely no heart. I got more than halfway through the movie, and although Caron was known as a prima ballerina, I saw no great choreography or dancing. It'a a bitter pill to swallow for a movie buff like myself, that wonderful  musical movies like Minelli's own Meet Me in St Louis, and others like Singing In The Rain, didn't receive nominations, and that wonderful performers like Fred Astaire and Marilyn Monroe and Doris Day never won Academy Awards.The old people(who are actually wonderful,and the best part of this dreary movie) are the only ones that have decent songs in this pic.  That is, if you can get past the actual words to ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls"", the lyrics are kind of creepy if you really think about them.  ""The Night They Invented Champagne"", which sparkles in the introduction overture and should be the movies highlight, falls extremly flat during the actual performance of the song.(Surprisingly, no  great singing or dancing.)The production values also do not hold up to that old MGM musical movie machine of yesteryear.  It's not a wonder why that this old horse would soon come to a creaking halt; producing  bland movies,with terrible messages, with uninspired actors= going bankrupt.To be honest with you, I don't think that ""Chicago"" should have won best picture even though as a musical  it was a good picture. ""West Side Story "", and ""Oliver"", and ""Cabaret"" are totally deserving of their Oscar wins.  But to think that this movie won 9,  count 'em, 9 Oscars, well, thats OUTRAGEOUS!

904250,"Back in the 1950's when EC comics released Tales from the Crypt, the moral police said these comics were too violent, too gory, too sexy and way too evil and and should be banned. Allowing children to read such filth would be the downfall of civilzation. I don't know about all that but when I was a boy I read and re-read every issue I could get and and my civilization is still standing tall.

It's obvious everyone invloved in bringing these dark tales to TV ""got"" whatever made the comics so popular and caused teenagers from my generation to invest our entire weekly allowance on this series.This DVD includes the first 6 episodes of the long running HBO series. The stories are lifted directly from 6 of the actual stories from some of the most classic tales which include a blood splattered bride, a grisly carny act, an ax weilding Santa Claus (which will be watched every Christmas along with Mircle on 34th Street), an old crone of a hooker, an umemployed electric chair operator, and a crazy old lady with too many cats.

350598,"Initially, when I saw the preview for this movie back in 1993, I will be the first to admit that I thought this movie was going to be terrible.  However, I was convinced to watch this movie when it came out on video and I must say that this is one of the best sci-fi/action movies I have seen.Demolition Man takes place in the year 2032 in the city of San Angeles, which encompasses the current day cities of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Diego.  The society closely mimics the society described in the book ""The Time Machine"" by H.G. Wells.  Most of society resembles the ""Eloi"".  Society has turned into a utopia of political correctness.  Most everyday things have been made illegal including swearing, sex, spicy foods, and salt for example.  The city has no violence or firearms of any kind.  Rather than prison, criminals are frozen and rehabilitated during their ""hibernation"".  However, there is an underground ""Morlock"" type society known as ""scaps"" in the movie.  The ""scraps"" are the free thinkers, which I would compare to modern day Americans.The leader of San Angeles secretly releases a violent criminal, Simon Phoenix (played by Wesley Snipes) to kill the leader of the ""scraps"", Edgar Friendly (played by Dennis Leary).  The police release another ""cryo-con"", a maverick 20th century cop named John Spartan (played by Sylvester Stallone) who originally captured Phoenix in the 20th century and was framed during the arrest of Phoenix.  Spartan is partnered with a bored officer named Lenina Huxley (played by Sandra Bullock), who is a nave police officer obsessed with the 20th century.The result is an awesome action film with a shaky plot.  This movie reminds me a lot of ""The Last Boyscout"", a loud movie with a lot of shootouts.  However, this film is also filled with many laughs, as Huxley rattles off many 20th century clich&eacute;s but manages to screw most of them up.  Product placement in the movie is everywhere.  Despite the frequent referral to brand names that would become nauseous in most movies, the product placement works very well in this movie and adds to the comedy and charm.  The movie also makes references to a couple of 20th century actors such as Arnold Schwartzenegger and Jackie Chan.If you enjoy an occasional pointless, loud, violent action movie, this is definitely the movie for you.  While I would not rate this movie as a masterpiece, I do think this is one of the few movies that pull action and comedy together exceptionally well.  I thought the mix of actors worked exceptionally well in this movie and complimented each other beautifully.  I would definitely say this is a must see movie!  I think the movie is even better now as it brings up a lot of memories of the late 80's and early 90's.",Demolition Man VHS

910770,"Larry Elder gathers input from an impressive collection of historians, lawyers, criminologists, and scholars on the role of guns in America, including comparisons of other nations' relationships with guns and gun control.  In addition to the erudite speakers interviewed by Elder, there were numerous man-on-the-street interviews which reflected the knowledge, ignorance, and opinions of Americans about gun rights.  Also fascinating were the insights of reformed gang leaders and their anecdotal experiences and views on guns and crime.The American public ranges from ignorant to sharply astute in their understanding of our Constitution, our nation's gun laws, and gun statistics.  Elder dispels misunderstandings, clarifies realities, and reveals the plain-spoken truth of guns.  The result shows guns to be tools (dangerous in the hands of criminals and life-saving in the hands of those who would deter them); shows that these tools are used far more to protect than to harm; explains that even if you could undo the 2nd Amendment and remove guns from the law-abiding, you'd still have a thriving black-market abundantly providing them to the lawless; and unambiguously explains that, love them or hate them, it is our Constitutional right to own guns.I confess a bias in reviewing this documentary:  I came into the 1990's a gun-hater, but found my opinions irrevocably altered over the course of that decade by exactly the kind of hard facts compiled and introduced here by Larry Elder.  So be warned, those of you who think you are faithfully married to the ideals of gun control:  this movie can alter your thinking, it can lead to the kind of knowledge and understanding that, once achieved, can never be undone.My one beef with this documentary is the title, which I thought was slightly misleading.  I had hoped for a greater confrontation between Elder & Michael Moore, though in all fairness, it's been so long since I saw ""Roger & Me"" that I don't remember whether Moore succeeded in any better of a showdown between himself and Roger Smith in that movie.  Fortunately for America, Larry Elder never had to ambush Alzheimer's patients to score pathetic points against his opposition, as Michael Moore did in ""Bowling for Columbine"".

Did these guys have enough box office pull in 1977 that would override these turd-like performances?I don't know but it's really a shame because it takes the edge off a film that might have been legitimately great had the two leads been better cast.Still, once you get past the fact that every time the two actors open their mouth you'll be disappointed, the rest of the film is quite worthwhile and it's unique premise, a series of duels over twenty years, pulls you into the story line, especially if, like me, you like historical dramas.",N/A

638760,"Some novels cannot be filmed, and Douglas Adam's THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY and its several sequels is a prime example.  The plot, such as it is, is non-traditional--but more significantly, the brilliance of the novel is not so much what it is about as how it is written.  And that, as screen adaptors of everything from THE GREAT GATSBY to CATCH-22 will tell you, isn't something that translates to film.No, Adam's novel cannot be filmed and it really is as simple as that.  Once you accept this, stop expecting the film to duplicate the novel, and take it for what it is--a riff on Adam's ideas rather than a bona fide adaptation--the 2005 HITCHERHIKER'S GUIDE is really quite a lot of fun.The plot is episodic to the point of interglatic buckshot.  Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is an ordinary Englishman without great aspirations or indeed without an interesting life, at least until the world comes to an end and he finds himself hitching a ride on a space ship for parts unknown courtesy of alien Ford Prefect (Mos Def.)  Along the way there will everything from  bureaucratic and poetry-reading Vogons, the two-faced (literally) president of the galaxy, a depressed robot with a bi-polar disorder, evil preachers from outer space, and, er, mice.The film looks sharp in its mixture of real-time puppets and the inevitable CGI effects, the cast is attractive, and at its best HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE has an almost Monty Python sensiblity.  When it works it all goes like a house afire; when it doesn't it is at least visually entertaining.  Purists will argue almost every aspect of the film, and truly nothing can nor should surplant the novel itself, but taken on its own merits the film is unexpectly amusing.

810791,"`Cold Mountain', a film based on Charles Frazier's outstanding novel of the same name, tells a powerful tale set in the end game of the Civil War, as the Rebel armies fought on though all hope for a Southern victory was gone. A wounded rebel soldier, Inman (Jude Law), deserts the hopeless fighting to make a desperate, dangerous quest to his mountain home in North Carolina and to Ada (Nicole Kidman), the girl that he left behind. The story cuts back and forth between Inman's perilous trek walking home and Ada's struggle to maintain her farm in a world fallen apart around her. Interspersed in these two strands are flashbacks to Inman and Ada's pre-war courting. It's a sad story of the cost of war, not on the battlefields, but on the lives and fortunes of those left behind on the home front.`Cold Mountain' is beautifully and movingly filmed. It opens with a dramatic portrayal of the Battle of the Crater that is stunningly effective in showing the brutal violence and horror of the hopeless war Inman leaves to seek his far away home. Just as effectively captured is the natural beauty of the mountain home he left behind, as well as the changing and challenging landscapes through which he moves on his journey home.Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are adequate leads, though neither really distinguishes themselves in their roles, and their near perfect physical attractiveness seems inauthentic for a film set in 1860s Appalachia. The best performances in the movie belong to the excellent supporting cast - in particular Renee Zellweger's brilliant portrayal of Ruby Thewes, the tough, coarse, outspoken young woman who taught the frail Ada how to survive. Philip Seymour Hoffman also deserves mention for his brief but evocative performance as a decadent rogue preacher Inman meets on his journey home, as does Natalie Portman for her role as a desperate, war widow mother whom Inman encounters. Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Brendan Gleeson, and Ray Winstone round out a fine cast of character actors.`Cold Mountain' is not a perfect film, but when all of its virtues are considered together - its stunning visual storytelling, outstanding supporting cast, and its use of amazing old-time Appalachian music throughout, it emerges as one of the best Civil War movies yet made. It is an honest, tragic tale of war's cost, told well. It has my recommendation.Theo Logos",Cold Mountain VHS
361200,"I'm having a hard time dealing with this movie. On the one hand, I think it, technically, is a masterfully directed film that kept me watching. On the other hand, most movies so obviously dealing with loss as a major theme have never touched me strongly. I'm always aware that I'm watching a movie. And in this case, I had conflicted feelings about Julie. I understand someone feeling a personal loss so greatly that he or she simply wants to retreat from everything. But at least half or more of the movie was about this emotional retreat. I began to want to shake her and say, ""Get on with your life."" There comes a time when sadness can become simply self indulgent. I also had difficulty finding an emotional bond with her. Discarding her husband's last manuscript, described as ""so beautiful,"" could be an act of emotional desolation, but it also is an act --within a movie -- of high vandalism. A person may be frightened of mice, in Julie's case more likely frightened of the sense of motherhood and dependence, but bringing a cat to kill and eat the mother mouse and her babies is an act of someone, however troubled, I wouldn't want to know. That she is distraught later helps me with her, but it doesn't do much for the mice.The movie is made up of so many sequences that, for me, don't build much resonance concerning Julie because, well, there are so many sequences. The emotionless love making with Olivier, the beggar with the flute, the situation with the prostitute in her apartment building, the young man bringing her the necklace, the old lady with the bottle, and so on. These and the other sequences are all masterfully done, but for me there are just too many of them dealing with Julie's frozen emotional state. Only when she begins to come out of it, when she invites her pregnant husband's mistress to the country house, helps the prostitute who sees her father in the audience, and then begins to help Olivier to finish the score...and agrees to jointly take credit with him and her husband, does the movie begin to pick up the pace. I know one can say that her emotional death is being shown by the slowness and ambiguity of the first two-thirds of the movie. Nonetheless, I think it was too much, at least for the story being told. However, for a movie being shown, it kept me watching. The use of brief blackouts to represent her emotional blackouts was absolutely masterful. I'd never seen it before. The ending, however, I felt was a little self conscious. Trying to bring all the people whom Julie had encountered, even briefly, into one big canvas to close the movie just seemed pushing it.

91690,"Until 2005's BATMAN BEGINS appeared on movie screens, 1989's BATMAN was considered the best of Dark Knight's cinematic entries...basically because the other sequels were so bad.Jack Nicholson's Joker and his nefarious plot may have been foiled by the end of this movie, but he gets away scot-free with stealing the movie from Batman and everyone else, for what it's worth.  It looks like they really jazzed up the Joker's scenes to attract Nicholson, but left Batman as a first draft.Originally, Sean Young was supposed to be cast as Vicki Vale and something went wrong.  I don't think the E! True Hollywood Story has even figured that one out.  But the role fell to Kim Basinger.  She's a great actress, but all wrong for this movie.  The reason: she's blonde.  It throws the entire color scheme of the movie off.  If they had gone with Sean Young's dark hair, then the only color in the movie would've been the Joker's crazy world.The major problem I had with this film was that Tim Burton, as quirky and gifted as he is, can't shoot an action sequence to save his life.  The film has no momentum.  The only thing slower is the next film, BATMAN RETURNS, which was a dark, indulgent mess.The set design of Gotham City was cool, the soundtrack worked.  But I was hoping Adam West would show up at some point to breath some life into the cowl.",N/A
398877,"First of all, I will say I am a big Marilyn fan, and for that reason alone would buy this movie.  She is incredibly beautiful in her last complete film, and her acting is wonderful.  Her charisma alone gets this poorly written, pretentious movie three stars.  I do remember reading a quote from Marilyn, referring to this movie script, in which she said ""He could have written me anything, and he comes up with this. If that's what he thinks of me, well, then, I'm not for him and he's not for me."" Obviously she did not care for the script too much.  It is truly horrible, probably the worst written rubbish ever taken seriously, but only by pseudo-intellectuals who assume anything by Arthur Miller will be up to the standards of ""Death of a Salesman"".  It isn't.  It is so pretentious, corny, contrived, and manipulative it never fails to disgust, degrade(you feel stupid even watching something so inane) and offend.  Still, Marilyn is magical and she can make any movie watchable.  This movie proves it.I would recommend this only for Marilyn fans, and then without reservation.  She is just so beautiful in this movie, and the image of her radiant face lasts longer than the revulsion from the insipid, hackneyed dialogue.",Misfits VHS
873178,"It's a great thing I saw this for free! Like the title says, the Divas really destroyed this from being a solid PPV! Let's begin...Match #1 Eddie Guererro & Rey Mysterio vs. The Bashams for the WWE Tag Team Championships: CRAP! Eddie and rey were suppose to lose resulting in a heel turn for Eddie, leading to him and Rey at WM21. It's 20 days until WM21 and I don't know how they plan on building this match up at all. Anyways Eddie and Rey beat the horrible Bashams and win the tag titles. Decent opener. 7/10I'm not gonna get into the Diva segments at all because they were a waste of time. They could have gotten rid of these and atleast had one more match in there, like Cena working two matches and the other involving the US title.Match #2 Booker T vs. Heidenreich: UGGH, poor Booker T...one of my favorite wrestlers ever, and he is getting such a raw deal here, it's disgusting. Book wons by DQ after a chairshot to the throat. I'm so glad Book got his revenge twice on Smackdown! and maybe they'll give him a good feud now, because even Book couldn't make Heidenreich look good...5/10Match #3 6 Man Guantlet for the Cruiserweight Title: A majority of the fans suck because they never give the cruiserweight s the respect they deserve. their matches are ruined by Divas and they get little to no recognition. paul London started this match and went the whole way only to get cheated by Chavo. Funaki walked in the champ and was the first to be eliminated, WOW! Chavo becomes new champ and we get to see Chavo vs. Paul London at WM21. I see this opening the show and it will be awesome! 10/10 even though this match was short!Match #4 Taker v.s Luther Reigns: Taker made reigns look good in a match that I was sure would stink the joint up, but was better than I expected. Taker wins, obviously. 6/10Match #5 Kurt Angle vs. John Cena for the #1 Contenders Slot a WM21: Match of the night by far! This was a war. I thought Kurt broke Cena's neck when he german suplexed him into the turnbuckle, CRAZY!!! I thought HBK would interfere here, but I'm glad he didn't cuz it would have made Cena look weak. Cena wins clean with the FU and is going to WM21!!! 10/10!Match #6 Big Show vs. JBL (c) in a Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match for the WWE Title: Kind of slow at times, but a great match! With the ""lack"" of outside interference (yes there was still some), it made the match good, and JBL won CLEAN! Big Show chokeslams JBL through the ring, Big Show rips the chain off the door and as he is about to win JBL's music starts to play...JBL crawled out through the bottom of the ring!!! AWESOME! The Cabinet comes down to attack Show, but then Batista comes in and cleans house of the Cabinet! Then Cena spinebusts JBL through some stage and he and Batista have one of the longest stare downs ever to end the show. 9/10!Besides the diva crap, this was a decent PPV. It was better then No Way Out 2004. The only other bad thing about this was the the barbed wire never came into play during the whole match.

297006,"I recently rented INHERIT THE WIND to see for myself if it was really as bad as I'd heard. It was. I am astounded to find how many reviewers have excused its massive deviation from fact under the banner of ""entertainment.""  Has our capacity to evaluate information diminished to the point that we are no longer able to differentiate between simple entertainment and pure propaganda?  When a movie presents a supposedly intellectual argument, and paints EVERY SINGLE MEMBER on one side of that argument as a buffoon maroon, but shows the other side as thoughtful, open-minded, and humanitarian, you can bet the farm that you're being propagandized! A couple of reviewers here have equated the movie with an indictment of the horrors of ""McCarthyism.""  These folks have been twice-bamboozled!  Obviously they don't do any independent research, but ingest whatever gets fed to them.  Go to [...] and click on ""Profiles"" if you want to learn the truth about Joseph McCarthy and ""McCarthyism.""INHERIT THE WIND pretends to portray the famous 1925 Scopes ""Monkey Trial"" with a little dramatic license.  This movie strays SO FAR from the facts that even saying it is ""based on"" the actual event renders that term so elastic as to be meaningless!  John Scopes is renamed Bert Cates (Dick York), Clarence Darrow becomes Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy), William Jennings Bryan becomes Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March) and Dayton, Tennessee becomes Hillsboro, Tennessee. The playwrights, Jerome Lawrence & Robert Lee, did not alter the names because they thought they could improve on them, but so they could legally reinvent history. The idea was to twist the truth & present it as entertainment ""based on"" a true story, knowing that over time, the drama will become accepted as factual by the masses. And it worked!  Look how many of us grew up thinking that INHERIT THE WIND was an essentially accurate account of the ""Monkey Trial.""All of the Christians (believing in ""Creationism"") in the movie are portrayed as emotionally-overwrought, brain-dead bigots. Paint any other group with such a broad brush and you'll be in court for the rest of your life, but here in Amerika, it's always ""open season"" on Christians.  Hardly sympathetic to both views, in reality, Darrow called Christianity, Bryan's ""fool religion.""Contrary to many opinions posted here, the acting does NOT make INHERIT THE WIND worthy of your time. March & Claude Akins are mere caricatures, but they're not to be blamed as Brady and Rev. Brown were written as cartoon blowhards. Tracy's naturalistic performance is enjoyable as usual, but Tracy was ALWAYS Tracy from film to film; there's nothing new here. Gene Kelly was fine as the cynical, MENSA-donkey newspaper reporter, but it was a simple part to play. The best, most sympathetic performance was actually turned in by Florence Eldridge as Mrs. Sarah Brady. Now her I believed.If you're interested in comparing the events portrayed in the movie, INHERIT THE WIND with the REALITY of the 1925 ""Monkey Trial"", to see just how far the playwrights deviated from truth, click on my name above, and go to my Amazon guide called, ""SO YOU'D LIKE TO...STOP FALLING FOR SPENCER TRACY'S MONKEY BUSINESS!""

The movie itself, of course, had nothing to do with Bruce Lee(which in a way in itself is a plus because usually Bruce Li's flicks are an attempted portrayal of Lee or blatant imitation at worst)...but the story is unique, the choreography is on-point, and my man Bruce Li(while not the MAIN character of this flick) renders the best acting and martial arts performance I've seen since he starred in Chinese Connection II(honestly...compared to his other movies, I've never seen my boy throw down so fast...lol). But I DO have to agree with many of the others posts and add that the only reason I didn't go on and give the Invincible a 5 is the whole GORILLA scene. What was really goin' on and what was the director smokin'? I started to cover my eyes and FWD when I 1st heard mention in the flick of the 'big apes,' and when I saw that mess I cringed at how fake they looked and at the fact that the gorillas were knowin' shaolin. AAAAAAAAGH!!!Would've done better as an outtake. But I strongly recommend this movie nonetheless, particularly to the die hard fans of Bruce Li's Chinese Connection II(official sequel to Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection) becuase like in CC2, he's being himself as opposed to trying to fill the Little Dragon's shoes.

912273,"It's a bit hard to be objective about this film, as my wife and I saw it in Santa Fe on vacation on an evening when we were in the perfect mood for a good film. We had no idea what this movie was about, only that it had two of our favorite actors, Sam Elliot and Joan Allen in it and that it was made in New Mexico. In a nutshell,  I found the actors to be so at ease and the story so human that ever so slowly I was drawn in to what proved to be a beautiful tale, at once sublety powerful and whimsical. Valentina de Angelis, as the daughter of the principles, is extraordinary (although she does stay close to precociousness now and then) in her role. I'll not relate any of the plot here, just encourage you to see this film as soon as you can. It will remind you that the drivel that pours out of Hollywood may catch your attention, but films like this stay with you.",N/A
925674,"-- though I'll leave it to others to discuss the historical accuracy.Balian, a blacksmith in medieval Europe, loses his wife. He finds that the village priest not only desecrated but looted her body. This costs Balian much of his Christian faith, and costs the priest his life. Balian joins a myterious traveller on a Crusade to the holy land, one step ahead of the law, whether or not that law stands for justice.The rest of the story builds well. Balian enters Jerusalem, and rises in importance there. His dealings with the other Christians in charge of the city corrode his already rusted faith. Although their voices aren't as loud, he speaks as one of the secular rulers of the city, dealing as fairly as he can with Jew, Muslim, and Christian alike.Balian becomes ruler of Jerusalem, through improbable circumstance, and its defender when the Saracens attack. The battle scenes are dramatic. In-fighting is bloody and vicious, and the night attack on the city will horrify anyone who thinks about it. The night sky light with Greek fire isn't that different from the napalm and phosphorus attacks of our own age, in all the worst ways. In the end, the city wall falls to the catapaults, and the attackers flow in like water through a breached levee.Although the city falls, Balian single-handedly saves the people in it. His personal honor is known and respected among the attackers, so they trade him the brick and stone of the city for the lives of its citizens, and for their safe passage out.It's an exciting movie. The battles are vivid, even if parts them were computer enhanced. The people are larger than life, but not exaggerated beyond belief - perhaps that's what cost it at the box office. Ignore the critics. It's well made, with characters you can care about, and better than a lot of other quasi-historical dramas out there.//wiredweird",N/A

201929,"Readers who have read my Amazon DVD review on F.I.S.T. (1978) and other films will have noticed my interest in the sharp contrast between actors Robert De Niro (and director Martin Scorsese and writer/director Paul Schrader) on the one hand and Sylvester Stallone on the other hand in their portrayal of similar themes - Vietnam war veterans, boxing champs - and labour union corruption.  In 1978 we not only see the release of two movies on Vietnam that share the Oscar awards among them (The Deer Hunter and Coming Home) but also the release of two movies on labour union corruption that resemble the divergence of viewpoints on the American dream for workers.  In Rocky (1976), Stallone's character is asked: ""Do you believe in the American dream?"" and a hesitant Rocky finally wins the heavyweight bout - the American dream came true not only for this fairy-tale character but also for a struggling Stallone as he received Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay.  But the film critic Schrader did not even receive an Oscar nomination in the same screenplay category for the critically acclaimed Taxi Driver (1976) that (in contrast with the Oscar Winner for Best Picture, Rocky) did not receive a single Academy Award.  Taxi Driver represented the polar opposite of Rocky - De Niro embodying the American nightmare.Two years later, scriptwriters Stallone and Schrader once again presented completely different views on blue-collar anti-heroes.  After Stallone rewrote Joe Ezsterhas's script, F.I.S.T. leader Johnny Kovac came closer to resembling icon Walter Reuther than thuggish Jimmy Hoffa (on whom Ezsterhas based his original script).  If Stallone had his way with director Norman Jewison, Kovac would not have suffered the ignoble end that finally prevailed.  But Schrader's Blue Collar comes perhaps closer to what Ezsterhas originally envisioned for his uneconomically long and commercially unfeasible movie script: a poignant tale of the tragedy of union labour corruption.",Blue Collar VHS

920274,"Today, many movies and television shows exist in order to offend, such as South Park and Family Guy.  They insult religion, ethnicities, and even the different genders.  Shock value is used to either teach a lesson or just plain have fun with the audience who would never think that anyone would say such things.  Crash is different.  The almost non-stop racial remarks in this movie aren't in good fun; they are meant to be taken seriously, as if real people would (and probably do) say/do the things that the characters in this movie do.  Crash shows us just how deeply ingrained racism is in our world even if we choose not to acknowledge it, and it does so without mercy.Crash takes place over the course of about 36 hours.  The movie begins toward the end, as we meet Det. Graham (Don Cheadle) and his partner, Ria (Jennifer Esposito) at a crime scene.  Graham makes a few remarks about racism and life in LA, then we are taken back to the previous day, and a diverse group of characters are introduced to us.  Farhad (Shaun Toub) is a Persian convenience store owner who relies on his daughter to translate most of his conversations into English.  Due to his poor grasp on the language, many things that people tell him get lost in translation.  Anthony (Ludacris) is a young black man who constantly complains about how black people are treated in LA by both white and black people.  His friend/partner Peter (Larenz Tate) tries to argue with him, but Anthony usually wins.  After a profound speech about how they are misunderstood, the pair carjacks an SUV from the Los Angeles District Attorney and his wife.  Rick (Brendan Fraser), the DA is a nice enough guy, but when it comes to politics, he tends to display a little ""reverse racism"".  He is way too concerned about how black people will respond to the carjacking.  His wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), on the other hand, is a high-strung racist who doesn't hold back when she thinks she has someone figured out.  Two other police officers soon enter the mix while searching for the DA's car.  Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) is a blatant racist and abuses the badge whenever he is in a low-risk situation.  However, when life is at stake, he tends to be a pretty good cop.  His partner, Hanson (Ryan Phillipe), detests him for his racist behavior.  Hanson is a rookie who (I hate to say this) is still naive and idealist.  The duo pull over Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), a very affluent black couple, and Ryan has his way with the subdued Cameron.  Finally, there's Daniel (Michael Pena), a Hispanic locksmith who, on the same night, has an unfortunate encounter with both Farhad and Karen.The cast of characters is very large, which in turn causes many interesting overlaps.  Different characters move in and out of the lives of each other, causing many misunderstandings, fights, and embarassments.  With few exceptions, every character at some time or another, shows that racism has nearly permeated our entire culture.  The characters that are openly racist can sometimes do good things for the people they claim to hate, while other characters who try to be moral can sometimes be subconsciously racist.  I can think of only one major character who never showed a racist side, however, due to the beliefs of someone else, was put in a bad situation.One of the best things about this movie is that it is so hard to watch.  Some of the things that people say are just so terrible that one doesn't want to ever think about them.  But I guess that this story had to be told sometime, and the writers and actors do a wonderful job with pure hatred.  The characters act and react the way their real-life counterparts would, while none of the characters are actual stereotypes.  The actors do a great job with this film, even Ludacris, who is a rapper, not an actor.  One reason for the great performances may be that the actors had a lot of passion for this project (Bullock even paid for her plane ticket out of her own pocket just so that she could be in this movie).This movie is not for the weak of heart, and not everyone may be ready/prepared to hear what it has to say.  Nonetheless, this is a film that I wholeheartedly reccomend.  Everyone should, at some point, see this movie.  The message is very powerful and very important.",Crash
407785,"Despite the great noir visuals, a good (if somewhat over-the-top) performance by Robert Ryan as the villain (you can tell his character is guilty right away) and the always welcome presence of sultry femme fatale Gloria Grahame, I think that ""Crossfire"" hasn't dated as well as other film noirs.  ""Crossfire"" is really two films in one.  First, the film is a murder mystery in which the crime turns out to have been motivated by anti-Semitism. This is the part that hasn't aged well, especially the customary (for a classic Hollywood film) educational speech delivered by a white actor (Robert Young) in a father figure role. Secondly, the film is about the difficulties faced by soldiers and their wives as they try to get back together in postwar America.  There are two couples that face this problem, and this is the part of the film that is still interesting nowadays.  In the original version of the story, the crime was motivated by homophobia and not anti-Semitism, which makes a lot more sense when trying to understand the relationship between the murder mystery and the domestic problems of the two couples.  The cast of ""Crossfire"" is uniformly good.  Robert Ryan, Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly are particularly memorable, but Robert Young and especially Robert Mitchum could have played their parts in their sleep.",Crossfire VHS
252863,"Provided you are a Batman fan, this is a good dvd for several reasons. Obviously, the main reason is the movie itself. The campy moments and the laughs from the television series are certainly there. But, there are also enough unusual circumstances that make this a movie as opposed to just another episode. (4 villains as opposed to just one, the batboat, the batcopter, an attack on the batcave, a new weapon at the villains' fingertips) These things help prevent the movie from being just another episode. Also, it is interesting to see how the villains' methods don't always harmonize. (Riddler's method of leaving riddles that lead to clues doesn't make the other villains too happy.) Batman and Robin are ofcourse on the scene but this movie also gives Bruce Wayne a fair amount of time on screen. All in all, the elements that made the series so wonderful are given a few extra ingredients. So, the results are the adventures, the many laughs, the suspense, the entertaining villains, feeling for situations Batman is in but at the same time laughing ('Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb'), and an unusually sad moment where Bruce Wayne makes a shocking discovery. Besides the good movie itself, there are a number of extras worth watching. The standouts are a recent interview with Adam West and Burt Ward, a small commentary on the Batmobile, and the feature commentary where Adam West and Burt Ward conduct a delightful tour through the movie. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and Kevin Conroy would eventually take on the cape and cowl, but Adam West deserves applause for paving the way for the movies, the animated series, and the animated movies.

862134,"Well, this movie can be bought on dvd and vhs everywhere here in the Netherlands since almost a year ago now. Kinda strange that it got released in the US only last month, and that it appears to be not that successfull, since this movie got only very few reviews.Anyway, if that is the case, I want to make clear that it is highly underrated, since it is a very good movie.Although you'll see the climax coming miles away, this movie still keeps you on the edge of your seat, and makes you wonder which one of the students who are bullied will snap in the end.The editing is very stylish, since it doesn't run in chronological order, but not confusing in anyway, I thought it was a nice touch. The soundtrack really adds to the emotions the ""victims"" feel; and by victims, I mean the students who are bullied all over through highschool and then finally snap.They went through hell, and a bully can't imagine what he is doing to a person. Don't get me wrong, I'm not approving of taking revenge on bullies by killing them, but to be honest, I can understand why they did it.If you're humiliated, bullied, abused, hit and kicked every single day, year in year out, you're bound to snap one day; a human being can only take this much.This movie really lets you understand the hell those students are going through, and why they one day pick up a gun, and don't care what they do, even if it cost their own life.Therefore this is a great movie, well-acted well directed and everyone should see this.I'm a teacher myself, and can't possibly understand how these things can happen and escalate. I mean, if a student gets picked on every day, it's hard to believe that the teachers don't know about it. So I guess, they DO know, but just don't do anything about it, maybe because they're used to it, and think it's ""part of the game"".When students in my class pick on each other, I immediately nip it in the bud, so I got a ""happy"" classroom, and after the first schooldays the bullying was soon over.But I guess, it can happen everywhere.Not only in America this happened, but it already happened 2 years ago in Germany, and last year here in the Netherlands. A student in The Hague snapped and killed a principal.I think people should act upon this ongoing trend, and prevent other highschool dramas from happening.Anyway, I'm rambling along about the events in our world, but this should be a movie review; and to come to that, I just think that this movie can be of great influence on students; not in a way, to encourage the bullied ones to pick up a gun, but I think it will convert some bullies and stop them from bullying others. I think unwillingly they will come to their senses and realize what they're doing to other people, and what consequences it may have.Therefore I absolutely recommend this movie, not only to students, but to everyone, since everyone should know what is going on in the world in in our students' heads and lives.",N/A

288593,"This review is for the 2005 20th Century Fox DVD release.This movie has a very simple story line.  A criminal gang is under investigation for two murders during separate robberies.  The gang is later infiltrated by an undercover FBI agent.  It has story narration and uses actual FBI film footage and late 1940's lab techniques to give the film an authentic look.  The well-written plot held my interest from start to finish and had a sufficient amount of dramatic and suspenseful scenes.  The two main characters: Mark Stevens and Richard Whitmark have great screen appeal in this movie.  I wish there was more of Barbara Lawrence.  I also liked the setting: the skid row part of a major city with shots in places like a seedy hotel, an arcade, a pool hall and a boxing gym.  My only minor criticism of the film is that it seemed too business-like in the way it was presented.As for the DVD, the image quality is overall excellent but far from perfect.  I did notice on occasion a top-to-bottom hairline scratch on the film negative.  I barely noticed it for a very brief period of time in just a couple of scenes in the first part of the movie, but then there was a segment near the end where it lasted for at least a full minute and was rather distracting.  The film also lacked the true noir look.  The black and white tones seemed a lot more washed out than the typical darker look one would expect for a noir film, but the film is still very watchable and entertaining.Overall, if you are classic crime noir fan of the late '40's, you will not be disappointed in this film.Movie: B+DVD Quality: B-",N/A

Good actors, a solid storyline that doesn't drag, great make-up and visual affects, and fast paced directing make this movie a must see for the serious horror fan.

Regardless, I would rather watch these guys chase Eliza Dushku  through the woods and up the trees any day than to watch Ned Beatty squeal like a pig! :-)Wrong turn is a truly scary and very creepy horror film. I get the ""willies"" every time I watch it! You really want these characters to make it out alive. Dushku is fantastic in her role as the strong female survivor. She plays it with everything she's got and it shows! The scene in which she is taken back to the cabin and tied to the bed.....well, it's a great piece of acting just as good as any of our beloved scream queens from years past.The rest of the cast also delivers consistently throughout the film. All in all this is a great film and a class apart from what has been released to us horror fans in the last few years. I enjoyed it tremendously, and would reccomend this movie to anyone who is a horror film fan!!",N/A
889800,"I just got through viewing this DVD for the third time and I have to say I think it is one of the best depictions (of a stage musical to film) I've ever seen.A lot of negative critique relayed towards ""Phantom"" seems to be related to the fact that ""it isn't true to the stage musical.  Gerard Butler doesn't really sound like Michael Crawford, la la la...""Ummm...I'm going to take a guess that these critics did not read the casting before they saw it and were thus disappointed?""Phantom"" is not meant to be an absolute re-creation of Crawford and Brightman's brilliant stage performances.  Anybody who went into the theatre expecting that was BOUND to be disappointed.But there are some great perks to the film.  The introduction, where the raising of the chandelier corresponds with special effects to recreate the Opera Populaire in its heyday gave me goosebumps.Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum have incredible chemistry.  In fact, my biggest problem was ""accepting"" the fact that Phantom is supposed to be a hideous deformed pyshopath (Butler is sinfully handsome, and no suspension of disbelief can change the fact.) Theirs is a more romantic and erotic depiction of the love triangle.Butler's voice is rich and sensual, more geared towards a rock sound than Crawford's portrayal.  This makes it DIFFERENT, not necessarily BAD.  Rossum is a joy to hear.It was also refreshing to see Raul involved in some action scenes instead of his portrayal in the musical of a trust fund baby waiting for the opera star to hand herself to him on a plate.I've seen the stage version twice, and was very pleased with the film.  It had enough originality and enhancement to make it grow beyond the stage piece.",N/A

422296,"You are never going to mistake ""The Phantom"" for anything more than campy fun, but it is enjoyable campy fun.  Billy Zane is just a bit goofy in the role.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the not-quite-bad bad girl Sala.  Kristy Swanson, of the original ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" movie, is swaggering girl friend Diana Palmer.  She reminds me of Princess Leia in the first Star Wars movie.  Treat Williams is corny bad guy Xander Drax.  None of these actors treat their roles seriously, and there is enough over-acting for two movies, but it all seems intentional.We learn at the beginning of the movie that most of these characters have a history that begins well before this movie.  Quill (Patrick Remar) has even killed the Phantom once.  Later we find that a lot of people have killed the Phantom.  It is sort of like a rite of passage for bad guys (and a throwaway one-liner).  Of course, we know the Phantom can not be killed.Xander Drax has attained an idea from ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  Find three mysterious skulls and achieve a power greater than any known to man.  The skulls are really cool.  When you find two of them, they burn a hole in a map to point the way to the third.  Far more efficient than having them point in a center direction so that it takes a significant portion of the movie to find the next skull.  Instead, we zip to the island, having a big fight, kill some people off and move on.  However, I am getting ahead of myself.At the outset of this movie we recognize how fun it is going to be.  The bad guys force a boy to drive a truck a rickety hanging bridge (perhaps another carry-over from ""Temple of Doom"").  The bridge threatens to break, but the boy makes it across.  During the bad guy's escape they force the boy to drive across again, but this time the bridge really does start to break and the Phantom has to rescue himself and the boy.There are later fun scenes with the Phantom rescuing Diana from a ship and escaping in a plane.  We have seen hundreds of cowboys drop from a building or a rock into a saddle.  How about the Phantom dropping from a biplane into a saddle?  The Phantom heads to New York City, proving that jungle people can survive in the Big Apple.  After all, the Big Apple is just another kind of jungle.  Billy Zane even gets to slide down elevator cables and escape just in the nick of time.This movie has all the elements of a fun adventure movie.  The characters have just the right combination of believability and unbelievability that the entertainment factor is high.  When people get hurt it is so cartoonish that you never can keep their injury in perspective.  The only drawback is that the original Phantom comics were never that campy.There are some downsides to this movie.  The plot seems to borrow way too many elements from the Indiana Jones movies, especially from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  As noted above, the camp factor was high.  This movie may have been too campy for fans of the original Phantom; not as extreme as the difference between the original Batman comics and the campy 1960s series, but similar.One interesting and fun choice for supporting actors was Patrick McGoohan as the Phantom's Dad.  McGoohan is a wonderful actor with credits in both television and movies.A viewer will not mistake this movie for something with Academy Award potential.  The movie is way too derivative.  However, it is highly entertaining as long as you do not analyze it too much.  Grab a bowl of popcorn, gather the family, and turn your brain off for a while.",N/A

I loved the young beautiful girl who played Wendy, but her teeth were...interesting to say the least. It was so obvious they were fake.

777463,"The near future: Some young people deal with their disillusionment by participating in an illegal virtual reality war game.  Its simulated thrills and deaths are compulsive and addictive.  Some players, working in teams called &#8220;parties&#8221; even earn their living from the game.  The game is named after the legendary island where the souls of departed heroes come to rest: Avalon.  For Ash, an expert player, only 3 levels are left in order for her to conquer the game.  She usually plays solo but this time she knows she will need a partner because the levels are bound to get harder and harder&#8230;Sounds like a blast right?  A wet dream come true for sci-fi and cyberpunk fans?  So I thought but Avalon is nothing but one big snooze, a movie deceivingly packaged as something it&#8217;s not.  It started off on the right foot, with an intense 10-minute action sequence showing Ash blasting her way through one of the levels of the game.  After that it&#8217;s all downhill.  Between the first 10 minutes of action and the final 10 minutes of action, the movie veers towards emotionalism and existentialism that is not in the least interesting, the whole film moving at a snail&#8217;s pace.  Ok, so maybe Avalon was intentionally not meant to be a fast-paced action film but rather a character study about one of its players.  Problem is, Ash is not in the least bit an interesting character.  She is a withdrawn person who spends the whole time moping, feeling depressed and feeling sorry for herself.  We are never really told why she is such an unhappy person or where her single-minded obsession for the game originated from.It&#8217;s too bad because if it had been done right, Avalon could have succeeded, it does have a few good things going for it.  In true cyberpunk fashion, the city is presented to us, convincingly, as a bleak and fascist place.  When Ash does strap on to that reclining chair and puts on her game helmet (in a scene directly lifted out of The Matrix, which itself lifted the scene directly off Ghost in the Shell) the images are striking.  The game levels are a dream-like visual feast of decayed walled cities and those sets just brim with desolation and atmosphere.  But as I mentioned previously the first 10 minutes are like that, the last 10 minutes are like that and the rest is an insomnia cure about poor old pouting Ash.Don&#8217;t let the plot summary or box packaging fool you.  This film is not a virtual reality adventure.  It&#8217;s a joke. It&#8217;s such a shame too because I really love this type of movie.  But beyond The Matrix and David Cronenberg&#8217;s Existenz I haven&#8217;t seen too many other VR sci-fi films that impressed me. If you know of any other good ones please e-mail me and let me know.",Avalon

Plenty of crazy and bizarre stuff happens. But why? Because it's the curse of the vortex, duh. Gee, thanks.

877056,"Certainly this is cheap. Indeed you will save your money bigtime and you will have all 26 episodes. However, the quality of these episodes is very different from the episodes that ADV originally released, and not for the better. Pay no more attention to the advertising gimmick of the remastered video and jaw dropping 5.1 surround sound, because this is the first way that the series has been ruined in this format. All that has been changed is the sound effects are louder and at times the voices echo. On top of that, the 4 director's cut episodes have been redubbed, with a few characters voiced by completely different actors.The other problem with this item is that the pacing of nearly every episode has been changed. Where there were pauses in the older versions between dialogue, now there are none. The characters sound like they have been drinking too much coffee. Even though Ritsuko is bummed out in Episode 24, she is babbling like a baboon.  I suppose in order to fit 6 episodes on one disk, this must be done.Finally, there are no extras, none. The perfect collection which runs at about $130 contains character descriptions, Spanish and French language tracks, plenty more artwork on the covers and protect the discs much better than the flimsy, thin covers on these DVD's.

800631,"I have to admit, I loved this movie. Sure, it doesn't take brains to watch it, but it's easy to watch, and enjoyable too. It's along the lines of Save The Last Dance too. I'm never going to be a dancer; I don't have the discipline or the patience, or the body for that matter, but I still love these movies. The soundtrack needs to be played blaring, without anyone else in the house, which I did today.I hadn't previously heard of Jessica Alba, I only knew she's in a TV series called Dark Angel, and she's going to be in the Fantastic Four movie? (How do I pick this stuff up?!) She was bubbly, and great to watch though, although I preferred her hair straight, as it was on the cover. I loved the cover for this DVD, it instantly makes you want to pick it up & buy it - plus it looks Holly Valance on the cover.I wasn't so keen on Lil' Romeo being in it, he's not that big over here in the UK, although I see he appeared in Jo-Jo's last video. Lil' Romeo grew two inches and his voice deepened before shooting completed. In the scene where Benny and Raymond go to class and Honey says that she has to go to a video shoot, Romeo had to stand with his legs far apart in order to appear shorter, because he was as tall as Jessica Alba.OK, so quite a few people are slating this movie, but they're probably expecting it to be some kind of gritty, realistic movie, when really it's for people who love to dance - or who love to watch it. There's some quibbles about this movie: there's not a single dramatic moment, and the setbacks come right on cue - Lil' Romeo's character gets arrested for example. The characters are straight on the train from Cliches Central, from the saintly title character of Honey, to the sexually predatory rival dancer. And I'm sorry, but no music video ever has the choreographer's name on it. It's just the movie's way of showing Honey Daniels did become famous. There's a lot of R'n'B cameos in it, although I know who Missy Elliot is, I was scratching my head when it came to a lassie called Tweet, or Genuine. There's also a love story, with Mekhi Phifer as the barber, basketball playing love interest, but the story is barely shown, apart from a few scenes with lingering looks, and chaste pecks.This is one of those films which is always going to be compared to others, such as Save The Last Dance, Dirty Dancing, Coyote Ugly or Glitter, and sure it's not original, and it's totally formulaic, but it's great fun.",Honey

628301,"It appears high school hasn't changed much for social misfits since Carrie burned down the gym or even since Jan Brady didn't make the cheerleading squad. The primary goal of this breed continues to be to find acceptance among peers they have empowered to be their superiors by the will of their own self-consciousness. Napoleon Dynamite is merely the latest incarnation in this 2004 MTV-produced comedy. The movie has nice visual touches (like the food-oriented opening credits) and some funny moments, a few even inspired (the sign-language version of ""The Rose"", the chicken farm scenes). It's also admirable that director Jared Hess (who co-wrote the movie with his wife Jerusha) goes neither the smutty nor the slasher route in drawing viewer attention. However, your enjoyment of this film will depend strictly on your ability to relate to a series of episodes that play out like one of those 1950's education films on how to behave on a prom date but reset to present-day, small-town Idaho. For me, the plights of the title character and his friends Pedro and Deb just aren't interesting enough to hold my attention. Accentuating the void is the fact that they are called upon to look very stilted and speak in deadpan, monotone voices. While amusing for about five minutes, it stretches an 86-minute movie into something that feels interminably longer.Jon Heder certainly looks the part of the supreme geek outsider with his red `fro, aviator glasses and polyester prom suit. But his character is simply not fleshed out enough to root for his success, as he avoids eye contact when he talks and encourages the abuse he gets from the more popular kids. As Napoleon's new best friend from Mexico, Efren Ramirez plays Pedro, who has no qualms about asking a popular girl out or running for class president. Former big-time child actress Tina Majorino (she was the little map-tattooed girl in ""Waterworld"") portrays Deb as a painfully shy girl who fancies herself as an Annie Liebowitz-type of photographer. They're all quirky enough, but you simply pay attention to these characters because no one else will. Usually someone like Napoleon would have a successful big brother to taunt him, but instead we have 32-year old Kip played with equal deadpan style by a pale-white Aaron Ruell. Kip spends most of his free time in online chat rooms and ultimately has a fanciful romance with his cyber-girlfriend, Lafawnduh. In fact, if you wait for the ending credits to finish, they even have a pastoral wedding. While the idea is funny, the ludicrous nature of the relationship feels overly contrived. Providing more honest laughs is Jon Gries as the moronic, self-proclaimed lady-killer Uncle Rico. With his 1980's-style toupee and constantly flexing his non-existent muscles, he lives in past gridiron glories that probably never happened, even buying a mail-order time machine to transport him back. His new career selling Tupperware makes for a couple of funny scenes.In fact, there are several amusing ideas, but they don't seem to add up to anything that memorable by the poignant tetherball-swinging end. One almost longs for the return of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"". Even the climax is oddly unfulfilling as Pedro's presidential aspirations hinge on Napoleon displaying some pretty impressive dance moves to a song by Jamiroquai. The DVD includes four deleted scenes and a black-and-white short called ""Peluca"", which stars Heder and provides the basis for the movie. There is also audio commentary by the director, Heder and producer Jeremy Coon. This is the first time I encountered a DVD that uses both sides to provide the full and widescreen versions, but it also means you need to flip your disc to see all the features.

The real fault that made me feel like the whole thing was just a waste of my time was the incomprehensible ending. (Spoilers Alert?).

217506,"Theodore Drieser was among America's earliest realistic authors, and his massive 1925 AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, loosely based on real events, was a best-selling shocker filled with premarital sex, abortion issues, and social failures.  The novel was filmed in 1931--and Drieser was so outraged that he successfully sued Paramount to force reshoots and a new edit.  The result did not please Drieser, Paramount, or the movie-going public, and when censorship began to rear its head both the novel and movie were quietly shelved.By the late 1940s, however, censorship began to relax, and A PLACE IN THE SUN was among the first films to take advantage of the fact.  Unlike the 1931 film, producers did not attempt to film the whole of the novel; they instead focused on the second half.  The result was singularly powerful.George Eastman (Montgomery Cliff) is the poor relation of a wealthy family--and when seeks aid from them he is given a menial job in the factory, where he becomes intimate with factory worker Alice (Shelly Winters.)  But when George is suddenly promoted he begins to enter the world of his dreams--and it includes glamorous socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor.)  And now only the commonplace and unexpectedly pregnant Alice stands between him and all that he has ever desired.The script veers toward excess more than once, but director George Stevens and his extraordinary cast carry the film to unexpectedly powerful effect.  Previously known as a sex-bomb, Shelly Winters fought hard for the role of Alice and with it gives the first in the series of truly brilliant performances for which she would become so well known.  Elizabeth Taylor was one of the leading beauties of the screen, and her acting chops had been in clear evidence for some time before A PLACE IN THE SUN went before the cameras, but it here that she first truly showed what she could do with serious drama; she is flawless.  And then there is Montgomery Cliff.Although Marlon Brando and James Dean made ""Method Acting"" a household term, Cliff was very much of the same school, and he broke new ground in film several years before either Brando or Dean made the screen.  And A PLACE IN THE SUN shows Cliff at his finest, offering a truly amazing, powerful performance as the highly-driven but morally weak George Eastman, stumbling over ever trip-wire society can place in his path.  It is a truly devastating performance, gut-wrenchingly painful in honesty, offered without a trace of artifice in evidence.As the film progresses the moral issues evolve in several very unexpected ways, most particularly as they reference degrees of guilt, premeditation, and at what point intent becomes the same as fact.  In the process A PLACE IN THE SUN develops a highly disconcerting ""there but for the grace of God go I"" quality.  I think this particularly true for those among us who can look back upon what might best be called ""youthful indiscretions;"" we are left to wonder what choices we might have faced if things had been only very slightly different in our lives.The DVD print is not remastered, but it is pristine, and it comes with a slight but interesting bonus package that includes interviews with the surviving stars.

920570,"Fresh from his success with the Academy Award-winning ""Million Dollar Baby,"" for which he wrote the screenplay, Paul Haggis directs this dark-hued independent feature, for which he also co-authored the screenplay with Bob Moresco. A district attorney and his wife are carjacked in Los Angeles by a pair of black men, one of whom is the brother of a L.A. police detective, setting off a complex chain of events. The intertwined stories involve married couples, pairs of lovers, partners, and other family units. Though the focus at first seems to be a bit too obviously on race relations, the larger theme that emerges is the lack of communication that can turn a minor misunderstanding into violent tragedy with stunning speed. The pessimism of this theme is relieved by unexpected rays of hope--a life is saved by the seemingly miraculous failure of a weapon; a police officer whose cruelty stems from his seething anger at life gets an unexpected chance at redemption; an affluent and lonely woman discovers that her plain, patient housekeeper is her best friend.Haggis unfolds his potentially unwieldy tale with remarkable clarity--though the film is reminiscent of Altman's epics, Altman doesn't have this control of pacing--and though there are a few too many coincidences the points that are made are so convincing that one is willing, as in Dickens, to suspend disbelief for the sake of the emotional payoffs. That so many of these ring true must also be credited to the large and uniformly superb array of actors, many cast against type. Notable among them are past teen heartthrobs Matt Dillon and Ryan Philippe playing a pair of conflicted L.A. beat cops, and Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock (particularly noteworthy in her brief scenes) as the district attorney and his wife; but the whole is tied together by the understated style and great, sorrowing eyes of the superb Don Cheadle as the good half of the two brothers at the heart of this tale. Lastly, the film is notable for the ease with which it captures a dark, frequently hostile, yet ultimately all-embracing Los Angeles, which by the end has practically become another character. Despite its occasional heavy-handedness ""Crash"" delivers both to the mind and to the heart of the viewer.",Crash
890023,"PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is certainly one of the most lavishly beautiful two and a half hours of film to come along in a while.  The constructed sets of the French Opera House Populaire from the exterior, the backstage, the auditorium (with of course the infamous chandelier!), and the subterranean grotto which serves as the home of the phantom are sumptuous for the eye:  they were all built with meticulous care inside the studios in England from Anthony Pratt's designs.  So, too, is the cemetery where much of the action takes place - all mists, tombs, statuary, snow, mysterious lighting, again with kudos to Anthony Pratt. The costumes designed by Alexandra Byrne are elegant and time appropriate and the large cast wears them with aplomb.  And if the film stopped here (and for many it does) this would be a sensational movie.The problem with this extravagantly gorgeous decor is that it is left with little substance to bear up under the surface majesty.  First, the ever popular Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is a bit of fluff meant for the stage, a work with superficial characters all of whom must bow to the real star of the piece - the Chandelier and its descent.  There are a few songs that are lovely, but those few notes are stretched over repetitions that try in vain to be transformed into fresh works.  The story itself is handed down from an old book by Gaston Leroux that has, like Dracula and Frankenstein,  for some reason continued to fascinate audiences in many incarnations. As a work for the stage PHANTOM has been satisfying audiences for years.  Joel Schumacher and Webber have now given us a cinematic treatment that for all its visual splendor is an empty, pompous, threadbare tale.The cast is certainly adequate, given the material.  Emmy Rossum as Christine is lovely to watch, has enormous screen presence, and a serviceable though thin soprano voice.  Likewise for the Raoul of Patrick Wilson and the Phantom of Gerard Butler.  One wonders why Schumacher insisted on actors who could sing their roles and then present them on screen with some of the weakest lip-synching on celluloid: they deserve better.  The one exception to Schumacher's rule is the Carlotta of Minnie Driver who does not sing her own role but DOES lip synch better than the rest.  Miranda Richardson as Madame Ciry is the most solid and credible actor in the cast, a group that includes the talents of Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds, Jennifer Ellison, among others.The cinematography by John Mathieson is splendid and despite the comments above the direction by Joel Schumacher does move this hollow vehicle around in a way that makes the story more convincing than did the stage version. His use of black and white imagery in the flashback scenes is splendid and suggests old etchings becoming animated. But in the end (and the end is a long time in coming) this PHANTOM lacks the substance that the Faberge trappings suggest.  Go for the decor and costumes alone and you'll not be disappointed.

631344,"""Batman Begins"" is one of the classier comic book adaptions of recent years. While it has far less in common with the DC comic book than one might think, virtually all the changes made to the characters and their history were essential for an audience that remembers the Tim Burton Batman films but seldom (if ever) reads a Batman comic book.This DVD is the single-disc version of the film, without most of the extras that the two-DVD set contains. Be aware of this before you order. If the extras are what you'd like, go for the two-DVD set. If not, used versions of the single-disc version are cheaply and readily available.The film traces Bruce Wayne's journey from an embittered and self-destructive young man into his metamorphosis into a mysterious and powerful urban vigillante. Christian Bale throws himself into the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman, giving us the best Batman since Michael Keaton. He's also given ample support from a Who's Who of Hollywood blockbusters - including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, and Cillian Murphy. Along the way, there are strong echoes of the Tim Burton films, through the character designs, music, and general mood. There are also some top-notch action sequences, including one of the strangest car chases you're likely to see.The film isn't entirely successful due to the almost total lack of chemistry between Bale and Holmes, and the absence of a truly gripping villain. Coming on the heels of the ""Spiderman"" movies, ""Batman Begin"" has villians whose motivations are far too shadowy to fathom. Liam Neeson turns in a fine performance as Ra's Al Ghul, and Cillian Murphy is appropriately eerie as the Scarecrow, but neither character is fleshed out enough (or over-the-top enough)to command our attention the way Jack Nicholson did as the Joker many years ago.Still, this is a great start to what will hopefully be a long-running and successful series. This is a movie well worth watching again.",Batman Begins

It gets off to a great start with the Season Premiere that provides momentum for the remaining episodes. Having Jack challenge Tru at every turn brings up so many more possibilities.

313599,"The first ""BLOB"" starring Steve McQueen is a ""reel"" cult classic, but this remake, 30 years its junior, has to survive on its own merit. With Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon matched as the unlikely hero couple pitted against an updated, more extravagant, and much more menacing blob, only the plot can hold them back.But the plot actually works in this 1988 quasi-gorefest. It is basically an almost-exact remake of the 1958 film with some minor nuances added like the government's complicity in harboring this ""biological weapon"" and the hero being actually a couple with more of an emphasis on her than him. Basically the other differences were in the precise roles of the various co-stars and featured players, plus the tendency in this remake to kill off more audience-friendly characters, including children. There is also much faster-paced action throughout, as this blob really goes after its meals like each one is its last.SUBJECTIVE IMPRESSIONS:This ""Blob"" really frightened my 16-year-old daughter who likes horror movies and is presumably not easily scared, whereas the original was a yawn for her. I just found it quasi-gory-but-interesting, if not a little too explicit. The plot really booked and the movie went at an almost real-time pace toward its inevitable climax; i.e., the presence of a huge blob which noone could deny actually existed. The only problem I saw is that the special effects depicting the blob (which were great for the entire film) seemed to waver at the climax. When the ""Blob"" was its biggest and most menacing to the largest number of people it somehow looked a bit unreal for the first time in the film. Since this was the most important scene in the movie, it would seem imperative for the effects to be as perfect as possible at this point. I was sure of this decline in visual effects when my chatterbox daughter, who had been silent for most of the film, confirmed this as she suddenly began commenting on the ""cheesiness of the effects"" at that moment and specifically about the creature itself during the climax of the film. Too bad, because otherwise the film is a real knock-out.The film, of course, ends with the characteristic nod to the 1950s creature features by implying rather loudly that there could be a ""Return of the Blob"" again. You'll have to see the epilogue to find out exactly how. In the original blob, the ending just showed a large military transport dropping the blob in the arctic and the sheriff and Steve McQueen musing over how we will all be safe as long as the Arctic stays cold - followed by a screen sized ""?"" [question mark].ABOUT THE DVD:You get the standard scene-selector feature and theatrical trailers from this film and several others. This is in Widescreen and the transfer is clear and crisp and the audio is much better than the video which I have had for years. The audio is a Digitally Mastered 2-channel Dolby surround in English, French, Portuguese or Spanish. Subtitles can be selected for all of the aforementioned plus Chinese, Korean and Thai. A featurette or documentary about how the special effects were achieved would have been nice. Although shy on features, this DVD presentation is first-rate and is the best way to see this film today.",The Blob VHS

630567,"Five years after ""Varsity Blues,"" another film about West Texas high school football comes with Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines who must lead his team to the championship, no matter what it takes.  Based on the real games and the real people, who participated in the 1988 season, 'Friday Night Lights' is more authentic and often alarmingly realistic than 'Varsity Blues' (which I like), in describing the glory of being the star players, and revealing the reality surrounding them.Director Peter Berg (The Rock's successful 'The Rundown'), perhaps inevitably, spends most of the films on the life on and out of the field of the high school players -- THE star of the team 'Booobie' (Derek Luke), team leader Mike (Lucas Black), and Charles (Tim McGraw) whose abusive father keeps on telling how he is disappointed with his son.  So far, things are not new.  If you think one of them is too confident, you already know what will happen to him.To see the life of Coach Gaines, with good acting from Billy Bob Thornton, is more intersting to me, for his life in the city of Odessa, Texas, could be very intense, nearly life-or-death matter.  The townspeople come to the Coach, and then, quietly tell him that their team must win -- if not directly, with uninvited suggestions.  And as far as the football goes, when they wish something, that something must be realized.  Like winning the State.[CONVENTIONAL BUT SOLID] Despite the semi-documentray touch of the slightly shaky and grainy photography, the film is made with an orthodox approach.  At first the film has some moments showing the players' doubts about their way of life, or even the way of the football itself (and the community that suppport with enthusiasm), but gradually the heroism takes them over, with the exciting scenes of the bone-crunching games and dedicated football players.  The story is very conventional, but the presentation is solid and well-paced.Like his previous 'The Rundown,' Peter Berg conducts everything with confidence, and the results are very satisfactory even though you don't particularly like the world of American high school football.  Even if you don't come to like the sports itself, you come to understand the people in this small town where the Friday Night Lights mean everything to them, the glory, the life and all.",Friday Night Lights

Wanna see how a man with the curse of vicariously witnessing this stuff deals with all of it - - and his family, too?  Sure you do. . . ever felt compelled to slow down to see a wreck on the highway?  MILLENIUM is not, and should not be, an easy watch.  It's violent; it deals with the darker side of humanity and its potential (and even inclination) for depravity; and as much as possible, given that it is a TV show, unblinkingly presents these issues.  But none of this is gratuitous.  Some of the best of this show takes place in the home of Frank Black (Lance Henricksen) and his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and very young daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady).  The contrasts between what Frank Black does to support his family and his life at home with them are most poignantly presented and some primal issues are raised:  how do you rear a child into a world of horror that you see so deeply into?  what do you tell her?  how can love survive in this world?  how do you keep insanity at bay?  how do you deal with the contrasts themselves?  Indeed, to watch MILLENIUM is to willingly participate in voyeurism, and in that respect the show isn't all that different from any other.  Frank Black lives in a voyeur's hell.

802018,"Yes, it's formulaic, typical Hollywood schlock.  My expectations were low going in, and that probably is the reason I didn't feel cheated by this underachieving film.  This is not great art.  This is not about great performances.  With the exception of a few scenes (most of which were in the trailer) this is not even exceptionally funny.  I already saw this DVD on sale for $10 at Target, not that I would remotely consider purchasing it.  CBTD is another case of Hollywood churning out bland remakes of classic films that weren't exceptionally good the first time around to keep its actors in circulation and generate a few dollars for the studio.Even plugging in stars like Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, and Ashton Kutcher can only do so much to raise the level of a film like this.  For them, I'm sure, it was a paycheck.  For me, it was cheap, mindless entertainment for a cold winter's evening.  Kids might enjoy the pratfalls and sight gags, but for anyone over 20, this is probably one of those films that you will sit blithely through, have a few laughs, and promptly return to the rental store.",N/A
4082,"Having read most of the reviews here and on other websites, there seems to be 3 main groups of people checking out this DVD set.1. Those who love the books and want to see an adaptation of the books.2. Those who loved the 1982 version (with Andrews and Seymour) and want to see more of that.3. Those interested in seeing the work of Grant, Shaw, Vibert or McGovern.Group 1 is generally sorely disappointed.  This version changes the main character of Percy in ways that will be highly discomforting: he uses minimal disquises, he kills people willy-nilly, he uses Bond-esque gadgets instead of wit and cunning, small things like that.  Not to mention, some well loved league members are killed off for no reason.  To see a hilarious list of grievances from Group 1 go to: [...]Group 2 is generally disappointed too.  That whole love affair/courtship thing between Percy and Marguerite is missing here.  #1 of this DVD starts right off with Percy giving Marguerite the cold shoulder after their marriage.  Group 2 is also upset by the change in Percy (that no disguises and murdering bit).  And then Elizabeth McGovern is not as beautiful (or animated or witty) as Jane Seymour and many in Group 2 are bothered by that.  Group 2 absolutely ADORES Anthony Andrews as Percy, and Grant isn't Andrews.Group 3 generally really like this DVD set -- especially if they are not burdened by preconceptions of this famous literary story.  However, Group 3 is likely to be a little lost in the beginning.  Note: Percy and Marguerite were madly in love with each other before getting married (you won't believe this when you see the first DVD, but it's true).  On the wedding night, he receives information that she has betrayed some aristocrats.  But he doesn't talk with her to find out what really happened.  That's why their marriage is in need of counseling at the beginning of DVD #1.When you read the reviews (many from folks in Group 1 and 2), you'll get the impression the acting drags and the screenplay is boring.  This is NOT the case (well, not in #1 and #3).  Personnally I enjoy the tongue-in-cheek take on the Scarlet Pimpernel; the fact that this Pimpernel kills loads of people(!) and walks around in English clothing(!) is hilarious.  Richard Grant has a lot of fun with his role; I like him more and more each time I see these DVDs.  Also Shaw and Vibert plus numerous supporting cast give excellent performances (Shaw in particular is my favorite), the costumes and settings are GREAT, and the script is well-moving and entertaining (especially in #1 and #3 at least).",N/A

621565,"More lavish animation, more unforgettable characters, more great songs, more sharply intelligent wit and comedy - all that and more goes into this sequel to the wildly successful Shrek.  The look and feel of this film really are incredible and amazingly realistic, especially in terms of all the human characters.  Unlike most films built upon a unique, breathtaking visual style, though, Shrek 2 relies upon a strong and compelling plot for its greatest success.  Even though the first film introduced us to Shrek-oriented parodies of fairy tales, motion pictures, music, and pop culture in general, the script still works its magic by consistently surprising and delighting the audience.  It's a worthy successor to a blockbuster of a film - although I still liked the first film better.  Aye, I laughed pretty much from beginning to end during Shrek 2, but the film lacked some of the truly gut-busting comic antics of the original.Do I really need to rehash the plot here?  Shrek's and Fiona's newfound happiness together is put to the test when Shrek's royal in-laws, the king and queen of Far Far Away, invite their daughter and her new husband home for a marriage celebration.  The folks expect Prince Charming, of course, and are less than prepared for the ogre factor.  Prince Charming is none too happy, either, and his mother the glamorous Fairy Godmother (you just can't trust a fairy godmother anymore these days) sets out to right the wrong caused by Shrek's unexpected rescue of Fiona.  The king is a willing accomplice, even going so far as to contract a hit on Shrek with the renowned feline assassin Puss in Boots.  In order to keep Fiona, Shrek makes the ultimate sacrifice, turning himself into a handsome man, but the Fairy Godmother thwarts him at every turn.  Even with the help of his friends from back home in the swamp, it looks like the honeymoon - and marriage itself - is over.Everyone seems to be wild about Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots, and he does make a great addition to the Shrek universe.  The heart of Shrek, however, still remains in the able voices of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and Eddie Murphy.  It's pretty simple, really - if you enjoyed Shrek, you will certainly enjoy Shrek 2.  The extras on the DVD add even more delight to the Shrek 2 experience.  The Far Far Away Idol contest is a brilliant addition.  You get not one but two filmmaker commentaries (but, sadly, no commentaries with any of the actors), and several looks at the making of the film are also worthy of your time.  The rest of the special features are a little less impressive than they look, however - several of them basically just take you to selected scenes from the film itself.  Still, there's plenty here to occupy your time and magnify the entertainment value of an ingenious film all but guaranteeing a good time for one and all.",N/A

All the best laid plans of mice and men.  Naturally, there are resentments among the boys as to who should succeed Henry and Eleanor gleefully stokes the fire of this powderkeg.  To say sparks fly is an understatement.  The raw emotion on display here is a virtual inferno and the only beneficiary is a delighted audience.  Anthony Harvey colorfully transfers James Goldman's play to the screen.  O'Toole, who in my mind deserved the Oscar for his work here, literally explodes on the screen as Henry.  He is literally a lion personified.  Hepburn, who did win the Oscar, gives a multi-hued performance here.  Yes, she is devious and unrelenting, but there is an underlying sadness in her character.

683523,"Very disappointing, esp. compared to the director's previous film, ""Run Lola Run.""This one is slow and tediously artsy/psychological, requiring monumental suspension of disbelief throughout...full of simply preposterous things like security guards who are unable to shoot and in fact are disarmed by the protagonists calmly approaching them with a ""you couldn't really kill a human being, could you?"" rap.  This is like the kind of egregiously bad film you'd expect from someone in their first semester of film school and devoid of a decent producer and film editor to trim off all the suffocating fat.  Methinks Tykwer may've gotten a bit too cocky after the success of ""Run Lola Run.""The camera work and cinematography is arresting from time to time, but there are way too many lingering closeup shots of the main characters looking troubled, experiencing DEEP EMOTIONS, pondering and pondering (what?  their next bowel movement, perhaps---in classical European style their expressions certainly have a please-somebody-give-me-some-ExLax quality to them).Franka Potente plays the most popular nurse in a mental hospital who spends most of the movie trying to get to the mysterious man who saved her life after an accident that he caused, and like her Mystery Man also has plenty of deep dark secrets of her own but not quite as Byronic as Mystery Man's own of course.In the end we see the redeeming and transformative power of love do its work on the poor guy but not really---the character development is very very thin which makes the characters' actions even less believable than the story already is.I suppose what the old saw that every writing teacher loves is also apropos to film-making: SHOW, not tell.  This film only does the latter, despite it being a very SHOW-friendly medium, hence as a film it is a complete dud.  It self-consciously aims for mythic signficance (see the title) but achieves the entertainment level of a mediocre made-for-TV movie at best.",The Princess and the Warrior

455441,"I don't know why everybody is saying how bad this film is. When I watched this as a kid (and I still do, apparently!), I fell in love with this movie as well as all of the other Don Bluth films of the 90s (Thumbelina, Rock-A-Doodle, A Troll in Central Park) that weren't smash hits at the box office like his first films. This story is funny, romantic, musically fun, and a whole lot more.This story is true on one account, in Antartica, the male penguins would go searching for pebbles to give to the female penguins they love during the mating season. If she accepts it, they mate for life. This is said by the narrator (Shani Wallis, Oliver!) at the beginning of the film. Then, it begins to go into song with ""Now and Forever"", introducing the main characters, Hubie and Marina. Hubie (Martin Short, Treasure Planet, We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story, The Prince of Egypt, Jungle 2 Jungle) is a shy, sort-of-clumsy, hopeless romantic penguin, who is love with a beautiful girl penguin named Marina (Annie Golden). He dreams of talking with her and asking her to be his mate, but as I said earlier, he's really shy and tends to doubt himself too much. Unbeknownest to the both of them, another penguin loves Marina, a strong, provincial, not-to-mention-evil named Drake (Tim Curry, Ferngully: The Last Rainforest, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas) and will stop at nothing to have her as his mate. The next day, Hubie hopelessly tries to find a pebble before the Full-Moon Mating Ceremony (that's where the penguins present their pebbles to their mates.), but ends up leaving empty-handed at the end of the day. That night, he wishes for a special pebble to present for Marina, and amazingly, his wish comes true! An aquamarine pebble comes flying out of the sky and onto earth. Hubie is very happy when he finds this, and instantly tries to find Marina to present it to her. But admist his running, Drake comes and starts bullying Hubie to give him that pebble. When Hubie refuses, Drake pushes him off a cliff, and into the waters, where a lepord seal is waiting! Hubie swims for his life, and before he knew it, he is thousand of miles away from Antartica, and on a ship, called the Misery, heading to America to be put in a zoo. Hubie is petrified at this, especially after looking inside the pebble and seeing that Drake wants Marina to be his mate. He is determined to get out of there, but not without the help of a strong, robust, and dreams-of-flying penguin named Rocko (Jim Belushi, Something About Jim, Babes in Toyland {1998 version}). Will Hubie make it back to Antartica in time for the ceremony? Who will be Marina's mate? And what about Rocko? Will his dream of flying come true?This film is fun to watch over and over again, and that music! Wow! Barry Manilow did such a wonderful job writing the music and singing the end title song with Sheena Easton. Even Jim Belushi can sing in this film! Amazing performance with Martin Short in ""Looks Like I Got Me A Friend"".This film has a lot of morals, two of them being extremely important. One of them is if you really put your heart and soul into something you truly love to do, you can do anything. And, if you're offering someone a gift of affection, it's not the gift, but the person offering it that counts. In other words, that person likes/loves you for being you. So, go on! Don't be afraid! Buy this film today! You'll be glad you did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",N/A

Armed with this knowledge, born of tragic past experiences of sequels that truly suck, ""Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous"" was foisted upon me.And I thought, ""What the...?"" I was laughing for a good deal of this movie! For anyone who knows me, this type of film is definitely not part of my scene, but I have to confess to really enjoying this one.The story line brings back Agent Hart, and teams her up with Agent Fuller with a massive anger-management issue, as they both get stuck into a kidnapping case involving Miss USA from the first movie. Of course, their involvement is completely against the wishes of the FBI, and also throws in a public image consultant to boot.""Miss Congeniality 2"" is one of those rare cases where the sequel has exceeded and proven superior to the original installment, in my opinion. The humour was more varied, Bullock seemed a more finished and polished performance, and the addition of new characters gave the movie some more depth and variety to it.The only disappointing thing with the DVD here is the lack of special features, which are just the deleted scenes. It would have been interesting to see a ""Making of.."" section and something more. This is a small quibble, but it would have been nice.If ""Miss Congeniality"" was your thing, you are going to love this one. I enjoyed it and had a very good laugh.

317541,"""Octopussy"" was the thirteenth ""official"" James Bond film, and Roger Moore's sixth.  While Roger is looking a bit ragged, this movie is plotted well and has some of the classiest Bond movie characters.  ""Octopussy"" was released twenty years after the release of Dr. No, well into establishing the James Bond series as the longest running movie series in history.  1983 was also the only year in which two ""serious"" James Bond movies were released, with ""Never Say Never Again,"" starring Sean Connery, released shortly after this film.  Two Bond films were also released in 1967; ""You Only Live Twice"" and the comedy ""Casino Royale,"" with an all-star cast that included Peter Sellers, David Niven and numerous Bond movie actors, including Ursula Andress and Caroline Munro.When agent 009 turns up stabbed with a valuable jeweled egg, James Bond is on the case.  His investigation leads him to India, where he learns that Kamal Khan is involved in a number of activities, some of them apparently involving Octopussy, a female smuggler who makes her home on an island where there are only women.Louis Jourdan plays Kamal Khan.  Jourdan brings significant class and style to the character, and may be Bond's classiest villain ever.  Jourdan's Khan is also utterly ruthless, and comes close to killing Bond several times.Beautiful Maud Adams plays Octopussy, which was her father's nickname for her.  Maud and her girls are smugglers, but you will note that their guns contain darts that put their targets to sleep rather than kill.  Maud Adams remains unique as the only actor to be in a lead role in two Bond movies, the first being ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" in 1974.  In many ways the character of Octopussy is similar to the character of Kristatos in ""For Your Eyes Only.""As the movie unfolds we learn that General Orlov (played chillingly by Steven Berkoff) has been plotting with Kamal Khan to use the military superiority of the Soviet Union to show the world that the Soviet Union remains a potent world power.  Kamal Khan's interest is money, however, and he cares little for Orlov's activities other than how he can benefit from them.Two principal characters support Kamal and Bond.  Kabir Bedi plays Gobinda, a tall, quiet, intelligent henchman.  Gobinda seems to be the one to spot when the good guys are about to make a move.  Gobinda is also quite obedient, to his ultimate chagrin.  Vijay Amritraj plays Vijay, a suave Indian who likes to play tennis, is well-spoken and educated.  Octopussy also has her sidekick in the character of Magda, played by Kristina Wayborn.  Magda is beautiful, athletic, highly intelligent, and much like Octopussy.The movie is focused in India until the principal characters travel to East Germany and Berlin where General Orlov's activities climax.  Here Bond faces twin knife throwers, a host of East German soldiers, a lady who refuses to give up her pay phone, West German police, U.S. MPs, a bevy of clowns, and a nuclear bomb.  The movie then returns to India where Q gets to take direct part in the action in a change of traditions, where Q has traditionally beem away from the action.The title song for this movie is sang by Rita Coolidge.  ""All Time High"" is a pretty song, and continues the tradition of having current music artists sing the title song.  The special edition includes a music video of this song, along with a short on Peter Lamont and a making of documentary.  Of the extras the documentary and the voice commentary are the best features.  Here are a couple of interesting facts from the extras.  The plane that flew through the hangar at the beginning was mounted on a post that was attached to the chassis of a car.  If you slow the picture down as the plane flies through the hangar you can easily see the post and catch a couple of glimpses of the car chassis.  Later in the movie when Bond is fighting on the circus train, the scenes with Bond suspended just above the moving rails was done with a painted moving below a pair of railroad cars suspended in the air, and a single moving train wheel.  I found it hard to tell that the railroad ties were not real even though I knew how the special effect was created.  I thought the extras were worth watching.""Octopussy"" has a lot going for it.  The plot is now slightly dated, but worthy of Bond.  There are interesting special effects, including a fight on a plane and an attack with a high tech hot air balloon.  There is also a cool ""crocodile"" and a saw-blade yo-yo that shows how much of a cutup a bad guy can be.  The title song is excellent.  Roger looks very comfortable in this role, and Maud and he have substantial screen chemistry.  I could readily have watched Roger and Maud in another movie together, even another Bond movie.  While this Bond movie may be less than the best, it is still a very good Bond movie and enjoyable to watch time and again.  You need this one in your Bond movie collection.",Octopussy VHS

This movie truly reflects the major events in the book (even though I wished that the movie could be a little bit longer).  This 3rd HP movie finally shows a realistic Hogwarts - the aging but still majestic castle, the creepy and dreadful Dementors (sooo scary!!), Hagrid's big hut, the Dark Forest, the Quittich games, etc.  I loved everything about this movie because - to me - it best reflects the growing dark mood written in the book.

243990,"This turgid potboiler is among the best...and of course the best are done by Douglas Sirk. The movie really belongs to Dorothy Malone, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of Marylee Hadley, the over-tanned, over-bleached, boozy, slutty daughter of an oil tycoon. Marylee's in love with her brother Kyle's best friend, Mitch (Rock Hudson), and will try practically anything to trap him. Mitch is in love with Lucy (Lauren Bacall). Lucy is married to Kyle (Robert Stack), but is in love with Mitch. Marylee is insanely jealous that Mitch doesn't want her. Kyle wants children, but there seems to be a problem - Kyle is sterile...or so he thinks. Everyone's always dressed to the nines and they all drink and drive all the time. The actresses all wear gorgeous 50s couture, and look fabulous - even if their 50s eyebrows are twice the size of the mens. Meanwhile, the viperous Marylee is telling the drunken Kyle to keep an eye on his wife and Mitch. ""You're a filthy liar,"" he says, to which she replies, ""I'm filth. Period."" And she's right. As she performing a very tawdry mambo in her room, she is peeling out of her evening gown and into a flame-colored peignoir, kicking up her heels and caressing herself...while on the stairs outside her room, her father is dying of a heart attack. When it is revealed that Lucy is pregnant, Kyle presumes it's Mitch's and beats Lucy to a pulp, causing her to miscarry. Kyle lurches off in a sodden, violent haze, returning later to kill Mitch. Marylee shows up, and there is a struggle for the gun. Kyle is fatally wounded. Marylee threatens to pin the death on Mitch unless he agrees to marry her. But on the witness stand, she recants, and the death is ruled accidental. Mitch and Lucy depart to happier, greener pastures, and we end with a shot of Marylee, now the queen of Hadley Oil, in her butchest Eve Arden lady-boss suit, as she almost-lasciviously strokes and caresses a miniature oil derrick beneath a portrait of her father. Pure camp, with a capital C.",N/A

884379,"I agree with other reviewers when they say that Clive Owen, nasty as his character is, is the only thing vaguely remarkable about this depressing, senseless film.What is this movie trying to be? It's all about raunchy talk and twisted sexual innuendos and allusions and yet there's nothing really even approaching sex between the characters. The best I can figure is that the two leading ladies are prudes at heart. If a person wants to watch porno, obviously they can, but this movie needed to put a little bit more of its money where its mouth is if we're to get a feel for the deeper reality of the characters. All I came away with was a bad taste in my mouth from watching three and a half (Portman isn't quite as repugnantly immoral) backstabbers from hell. Law and Roberts deserve something horrid to befall them; what a couple of childish, lying, selfish monsters. Why would Owen want Roberts back the third time, simply revenge? At least his character was almost believable as some obsessive macho type with a bit of a (twisted) mind. Can't quite buy him as a doctor, though.I also definitely couldn't buy Portman's sudden about face with regard to Law at the end. Nobody who truly loves somebody as much as she supposedly loves Law could instantly and utterly write them off for simply wanting to know the truth. I couldn't really buy Portman in this role in general, actually. She seems like some kind of bleeding heart, Ivy League ______ Princess type in real life and I think that her playing a vagabond/stripper, no nudity mind you, is just one of those things actors try to do to show off their ""range"". I can't see her as anything other than Natalie Portman in anything she has yet played. She was promising in ""The Professional"" but has since never even matched her work in that film from the early 90s. I can't say I really get Roberts as a heartbreaker either. She has a unique look and vibe, but nothing to launch a thousand ships or drive a man to threatening murder. Glad that this one only cost me a dollar to rent, neighborhood promotion, and a couple hours of my time. Too pretentious and phony realistic; typical of a lot of modern plays...",N/A

593849,"Those little creatures with the little furry feet save the day in this final film of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  This movie was my favorite of the three, The Two Towers my least favorite, The Fellowship of the Ring my second favorite.  (The timing of the release of The Two Towers kind of gave me the creeps).  This film was meant to be the grand finale, and Peter Jackson, the Academy winner in 2003, pulled it off.  The supplemental dvd explains a little about the behind the scenes work that went on and explains how faithfully Peter Jackson tried to create the story as the book describes it.  I read the entire trilogy as a child when I was 10 or so years old, (a long time ago)!  Haven't read it since, yet as I watched the whole series, I began to remember how I had pictured the story in my mind as I had read it decades ago and began to recall (vaguely) what I had read.  I think that's a testimony, to me at least, of Jackson's work.  (I don't recall the Aragorn/Arwen love story at all; I think Jackson just threw that whole thing in the trilogy to spice things up a bit!)  As much as I love watching Orlando and Viggo, this movie to me was a movie about hobbit heroism, and I loved watching the close friendship that had to develop between the hobbit foursome during this perilous quest especially in this last film.  None of the actors got any awards for this movie, yet nearly all the behind the scenes crew did.  Jackson did a spectacular job all around, and was very careful in picking a cast that would work well together during the 3-4 years it took to complete the Trilogy filming.  The Lord of the Rings was written by J. R. R. Tolkien, published in 1954.  What I loved about reading the trilogy, was how Tolkien portrayed good and evil throughout the work.  The story, yes, and especially in The Return of the King, is about the battle between good and evil, the hobbits, the elves, and humans versus Sauron and his evil band, yet there is evil within the heart of everyone as Frodo (Elijah Wood) must grapple with the ring's power to stir up this covetous/idolatrous character flaw within us all.  It's no wonder that Tolkien was raised christian, and this constant inner battle is analogous to the working of the Holy Spirit, the process of sanctification, within those who have given their lives to Christ.  I was on the edge of my seat during the final battle scene, nearly moved to tears.  My favorite scene was the one where Pippin (Billy Boyd) sings a song a capella whilst the battle rages.  No one ever mentions that scene or his singing, but I was really moved by it.  So many of the actors were not top billing in any movies before The Lord of the Rings, but they all performed so well.  Would that these furry-feeted people really existed, would that the world resembled the hobbits' shire.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King

879216,"While Gregory Peck heads the cast, ""The Purple Plain"" is a British World War II film, produced in 1954 by the J. Arthur Rank Studios (and presumably distributed by MGM). So far reviews seem to fall into two camps--people who love it and people who are unimpressed with it. I find myself somewhere between these two extremes. Unlike at least one other reviewer, I will try not to reveal too much of the plot for first-time viewers.Mr. Peck plays Squadron Leader Bill Forrester, a Canadian pilot and veteran of the Battle of Britain, now assigned to the Asian theatre of the war, specifically Burma, against the Japanese. Having lost his young wife in the London blitz, Forrester feels he has nothing to live for, and flies his Mosquito missions accordingly. He is reckless, even suicidal, much to the chagrin of his navigator as well as the people on the ground.The kind Dr. Harris (a ""pre-M"" Bernard Lee) tries to help Forrester out of his depression by involving him with some of the local Burmese people, including a lovely young woman, Anna (Win Min Than). Forrester becomes captivated with Anna, and slowly regains his self respect and will to live. His survival instincts are soon put to the test. On the next flight, his plane crashes in very harsh, and Japanese-held, territory. Forrester survives the crash along with his young navigator(Lyndon Brook), who receives nasty burns, and an older scientist, Blore (Maurice Denham). With limited water, and the blazing Burmese sun, the three men face a harsh fate, with a questionable chance of survival. Can Forrester return to the woman who has rekindled his interest in life, and redeem a tattered reputation with his compatriots ?Mr. Peck delivers a compelling performance--he remains one of the most watchable actors in movies. I should also mention that fine British character actress, Brenda De Banzie--her role is small, but she leaves an indelible impression as Miss McNabb, the indefatigable Scottish missionary.The full-screen picture exhibits effective colour--the sound is mono--don't look for extras.""The Purple Plain"" may not be one of Gregory Peck's most famous films--nor can it be considered one of the classic films of the fifties. At the same time, I found it an absorbing drama, well-acted by Mr. Peck, Ms. Than and a fine British cast--there is action, romance, suspense and important, universal themes are explored. I am pleased to add this DVD to my collection.",The Purple Plain 1954

Prostitution is a very ugly, exploitative scene in real life, not the lighthearted fun that the film portrays. Not the best moral message, to be sure.Aside from that, the other problem I have is with the characters. EVERYONE is a jerk in this movie. Nobody is appealing or likeable. Not even Cruise's Joel, who I found to be as much of a self-centered @#$%&*/ as everyone else. Unfortunately, he followed up by playing the same kind of obnoxious characters (""Top Gun"", ""Days of Thunder"").

874674,"This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.The movie opens in the French Quarter of New Orleans where a group of four men are having a serious poker game and one of the men, Kochak, who is new in town, claims that he is not feeling well and decides to leave.  The other players object since this guy has won a substantial amount of money and they feel he hasn't given them an adequate opportunity to win their money back.  Kochak then runs off and the remaining three, Blackie (Jack Palance), Ray Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Tommy Cook) chase him into a train yard and corner him.  When Kochak tries to fend off these apparent attackers, Blackie shoots him dead and they take his body and dump it in a nearby canal.  After the body is found by the local police, the coroner examines the corpse and discovers that he may have had a serious disease.  To confirm this diagnosis, Dr. Clint Reed (Richard Whitmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service is called in to examine the body and concludes that the victim was ill with the pneumonic plague.  Due to the deadly and contagious nature of this disease, Reed meets with the police and local government to let them know that aggressive action needs to be taken to find out who this victim was, where he came from and who has he been in contact with.  When Fitch and Blackie find out that the police are making a major deal about this person's murder, they conclude that he smuggled something into the country very valuable and they believe that Poldie knows more than he's let on.  This sets up the remainder of the movie involving where Dr. Reed and the police have a 48 hour window to crack the case and stop a city-wide epidemic, while Blackie and Fitch put the squeeze on Poldi since they believe he's double-crossed them.I really like the way this film started off .  The scenes from the French Quarter with the boogie woogie music playing in a nearby lounge really made a stunning impact on the look and feel of the movie.  But as the movie went on, it seemed too much time was spent on bureaucratic issues between Reed and the police and other officials.  Watching the film, it seemed like mass hysteria could break out at any minute but never did.  Jack Palance was fantastic as the consummate tough guy but he couldn't carry the movie.  The climax seemed very tame which amounted to a very mundane chase.  The film was likable, but not lovable for me.  It's a shame too, since night time in the French Quarter makes the perfect setting for a film noir movie.The DVD quality was immaculate.  Not only was the picture free of visual defects, there was no observable graininess in the black & white full screen presentation.  The sound was very good too.

165838,"Groundhog Day......comedy or philosophy flick?  I guess its subjective to the audience. People will enjoy it for different reasons.  It is nonetheless a classic.Brief overview:  Bill Murray plays a weather man who for unknown reasons lives the same day over and over again in Punxutawney Pennsylvania.  The day is February 2nd, groundhog's day.  Each night he lays down to sleep, or dies, and is reborn anew, again on February 2nd.First off I'd like to point out that this film sits on a foundation of lies and has affected many people's lives in a terrible way:  It wasn't filmed in Punxutawney at all.  The director and producers felt that Woodstock Illinois was more ""idealic"" and choose to do principal photography there.....this eventually led to envy and resentment on the part of the real life citizens of Punxutawney.  Over half the population of Punxutawney actually invaded the town and homes of Woodstock to enjoy what, after viewing the film, clearly was a more idealic town.  As murderous doppelgangers, they adopted the lives of the Woodstock folk and still live there today.  It was a sad turn of events unpredicted by the film's creators.  If only they had thought of the consequences hundreds of lives would have been saved.With that out of the way.....I think the natural course of the film's premise is going to take you through a very pure human emtional progression.  The original screenplay was lightly based on Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' Five Stages of Grief which are: 1-shock/denial;  2-anger, rage, resentment;  3-bargaining;  4-depression;  leading to 5-ultimate acceptance.  I find it most interesting to see that this progression leads Murray's character to the realization of the benefits of acting with morals.  This provides a great example that people do not need external threats of eternal damnation or rewards of heaven to act with good natured morals and to treat others with altruistic compassion.  At stage 4, Phil (Bill Murray) acts violently out of his depression of being trapped.  He kills himself in many ways.  He robs banks.  He goes joy-riding on railroad tracks.  Then when he finally accepts his fate, he knows when and where to be to help everybody in town that has a mishapt.  He catches a boy who falls from a tree, replaces a flat tire for some old ladies....and so on.Perhaps it is to be seen as a kind of divine working of the universe that it is only after this stage of acceptance when the repeating day ends and Phil finally gets to see February 3rd.  Also it is never revealed why Phil went through the whole thing or why it suddenly ends.Whatelse?- Um, Murray's humor is borderline assinine, which I think is gggggreat!- Director Harold Ramis actually admits on his commentary that he helped write the theme song ""Weatherman"".  Once you hear this song you will wonder why anybody would ever admit to writing that horrid tune.- I'd like to know why there is no hot water in Phil's hotel.  That is never explained, not even on the director's commentary.  Its kinda like they just decided to do something odd without purpose.- Every religious fanatic thinks this movie is based on their particular faith.  Go figure!  Turns out the movie IS secular, even though writer Danny Rubin is referred to (never confirmed) as Zen Buddhist.In summary, it does snow in space.",N/A

956258,"""Leave my forefathers out of this! We from Chicago, Southside!""- Spooner finally thaws out in ""The Fog""Ask why John Carpenter gave the go ahead for this bastardization of a remake & his reply is, ""Why not!? Everyone else is doin' it!""  Yeah, but that doesn't mean YOU should do it. But, nevertheless, here it is a remake to Carpenter's 1980 classic that sucks like the biggest black hole with no ending in sight (""The Fog"" will land with a thud on DVD January 24th, 2006 in it's original PG-13 format or in an unrated format, either way the film still sucks).The plot is still the same: Antonio Island or Bay (take your pick) is celebrating its 125 years of existence. A new monument to the towns three founding fathers has been erected right out in front of town hall. But, their is an ominous backstory to the town's origins & the citizens of Antonio Island are going to pay for it with their very lives. An unholy fog has rolled onto shore mysteriously killing anyone in its path. Its up to the towns descendents to figure out the mystery of the fog before its too late.Carpenter is without a doubt one of the true masters of suspense & horror. With the 1980 original version to ""The Fog"" he brought a great ghost story to the screen with the right amount of atmosphere, suspense, & with his trademark score ""The Fog"" remains one of his best films.The remake, however, is a different story entirely. Its crap. Every single frame of this film sucks.The characters are two-dimensional & after seeing the original a few times over the years, I couldn't really visualize anyone else in these roles. Tom Welling, Selma Blair & the entire cast are an absolute waste. Blair doesn't have the purr that Adrienne Barbeau had as Stevie Wayne, Welling wasn't believable as Castle let alone a fisherman, & the Father Malone & Old Man Macon characters get little less than 5 minutes of screentime - combined.The tweaking of the original story is really lame. Did we really need to see the whole backstory of the Elizabeth Dane plotline? Hal Holbrook's, Father Malone did a perfect job of reading from his grandfather's diary with out the need of one flashback, or an extra tug from his drinking flask! Has American society become so fu**ing attention defecit disorientated that we need to have everything spelled out for us? Leave a lot to the imagination - it's more creepier that way.The ending is the worst insult to Carpenter fans. What in the hell were they thinking?! I was so pissed off when I left the theatre & I have come to the conclusion that John Carpenter can't truly be trusted (hey folks, he gave the nod for this remake).

613763,"Before I first saw this film, I was afraid it would be another 'Cutthroat Island'. In other words, horrible. Was I ever wrong! The plot line is fun and imaginative, the writing well done, the special effects are wonderful, but the real reason this film works is the casting. Every actor does a fine job with his/her role, in particular Geoffrey Rush, but the instant Johnny Depp sails on screen, you're hooked into it. His swaggering performance was over-the-top, campy, and just absolutely perfect for the film. He was truly the heart and soul of the picture, and just may have given the best performance of his career. The only thing wrong with the movie to me, the climactic sword fight between Barbossa and Capt. Sparrow seemed a bit long and drawn out, but that's a minor quibble in an otherwise fine film. Is it the best film of the year? No. Is it memorable? Certainly. It's fun to think that pirate movies, once the heart of Hollywood action long dead, are now back in favor and more are planned. Get this fine film and enjoy a fine Hollywood throwback thrill-ride!",Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl

883092,"Adapted from Danish writer Anne Holm's 1963 best selling novel 'David' (translated into English in 1965 as 'I Am David') and written for the screen adaptation by Director Paul Feig, this film is one of conviction on the part of all those involved to re-create the odyssey of a child into the throes of the world and all that that entails.  It is a story of hope, determination, and discovery and avoids being mawkish in favor of maintaining a quiet, progressively interesting journey of the heart and the mind.David (Ben Tibber) is eleven years old and has live his entire life in a camp in Bulgaria, one of Stalin's Gulag Archipelago points of detention for the many who eventually died after WW II, not in Nazi camps but in the lesser known but equally severe Soviet counterparts.  Having only lived as a prisoner with a single friend Johannes (Jim Caviezel) to guide his growth and be a surrogate parent/family, David has no concept of the world outside the confine of the camp. He is given a letter by an off screen voice with the instructions on how to escape the camp and go to Denmark to deliver this important document.David follows instructions, escapes the camp with the advice to trust no one and to blend in with the crowd for safety, and soon he begins to encounter the people of the outside world.  Too frightened to trust anyone, David crosses into Salonika and eventually boards a ship bound for Italy 'befriended' by an Italian worker, swims ashore in Italy, is offered small jobs by American tourists (Paul Feig and Lucy Russell) and Italian shopkeepers, and encounters a wealthy family in his brave and successful rescue of a girl from a burning house.  He is treated well, yet fears connection and knows his assignment and again is on the road toward Denmark.  Provided transportation to Milan by the Italian ship worker, David eventually in his walking journey finds Sophie (Joan Plowright) painting in the hills by Lake Como.  Sophie is the first maternal figure he has encountered and provides David with safe passage to her home in Switzerland.  David's fears are gently assuaged by Sophie and when Sophie discovers the contents of the envelope David has so cautiously been guarding, the contents yield the information that results in David's completing his journey to Denmark in an airplane courtesy of Sophie.  The raison d'etre of the story is revealed in these last frames.The cast is uniformly excellent: Ben Tibber is a fine little actor with minimal experience, Jim Caviezel gives his best performance (though very small) since 'Frequency', and Joan Plowright adds the right dimension of professional glow to her radiant portrayal of Sophie.  The many smaller cast members are  genuine and memorable and the pacing of the film by Feig is on target.  Roman Osin is the superb cinematographer: he has captured the dank stench of the camp as well as the many vistas of the glorious landscape of Italy and Bulgaria with finesse.  The musical score by Stewart Copeland (with a little help from Mozart's 'Ave Verum Corpus'!) is enhancing and in keeping with the multiple locales of David's journey.  In all this is a heartwarming, beautifully executed film that holds true to Holm's beloved book for young people.  The DVD includes many deleted scenes, some of which are splendid, and an extended history of the Gulag Archipelago and the making of the film.  A first rate package.  Grady Harp, May 05",N/A

206125,"It doesn't stink as much as some reviewers have foisted off on this site, but don't go expecting a tight plot.Somewhere along the way the scriptwriters seem to have gone berserk with expensive attempts to be all things to all people -- goofball romantic comedy, courtroom melodrama, high-octane thriller with flaming pyrotechnics. The overloaded plot revolves around an assistant D.A. who gets involved with a defense lawyer to solve a convoluted case that includes arson, art robbery, insurance fraud, even murder.It's almost as if the plot was not the point. The 22-carat charisma of Robert Redford and the starry-eyed charm of Debra Winger is what keeps the film afloat with some delicious chemistry. Daryl Hannah is very effective as the spaced-out daughter, who spends most of the movie seeming sexy and/or guilty.The whole mishmash ends up significantly less than the sum of its parts, which is sad because with only slightly better editing it stood on the brink of being an excellent film. That, it isn't.",N/A

I'm sorry!This, the third installment of the Harry Potter movies, WAS ok, but not as good to me as the first two. This must have been a very complex book, because they just tried to do too much in the plot of this one.I did enjoy it because Harry ends up learning much more about his parents through the addition of some other characters, including a surprise one or two.  I especially liked his ""connection"" with the Prisoner of Azkaban, which ends up being sort of a plot twist.It'll be interesting to see where they go from here with the movies, because overall I enjoyed myself.

638752,"Every so often, along comes a quirky story that manages to stick around.  Douglas Adam's ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is the quintessential example of such a story.  The original book was written in 1980, and was a phenomenal hit, though more or less on the cult level, as its strange and very British sense of humor can only be really appreciated by those with the taste for it.  It is somehow fitting, though, that Adam's original idea has had a rather unique journey from page to screen.  Unlike most novels, which go immediately from book to film, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide"" has previously been a radio series,  a record album, a TV series, a computer game, a graphic novel, and even a towel.  It has taken 25 years, but the movie adaptation is finally here, ready to dazzle or disappoint its long-patient fans.Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is the atypical everyman who is whisked off the soon-to-be-demolished Earth by his friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def), the author of the astonishing Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  The Guide is a repository of all the information about just about anything in the universe.  Kind of like the Internet was supposed to be.Arthur and Ford cross paths with Ford's cousin, the two-headed Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), the President of the Galaxy, who acts much more like an aging hippie than a government official.  Beeblebrox is accompanied by his human girlfriend Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) and Marvin, the manic-depressive robot (performed by Warwick Davis, voiced by Alan Rickman).  The whole bunch are soon off to uncover the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe, and Everything, because we already have the answer:  42.Bizarre, I know.  But it is this charming randomness that makes ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" so much fun to watch.  I quite enjoyed this odd example of English humor, though those who don't have a taste for the British wit may want to skip this one.  It's got a different flavor than Monty Python, but still has that foreign feel all the same.Though the film is not word-for-word faithful to the original novel (a major complaint among the ""Hitchhiker"" purists), the changes and additions are still very much in keeping with Douglas Adam's style, as well they should be; Adams developed all of the original concepts for the film before his death.Having recently read the novel, I was very pleased with the adaptation; it manages to keep the feel and pace of the book, but adds its own spin to things and is unique and special all on its own.Speaking of which, it does help to have read the book first, as this is the kind of film that throws you into a whole new world, and does not slow down to explain everything.  You've got to roll with the punches, as it were, and just try to keep up with the story, rather than get bogged down admiring some incredibly ugly aliens.So stick your thumb to the stars, and enjoy the ride!  We'll see you at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.  So long, and thanks for all the fish!",The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Full Screen Edition

913993,"THE BROWN BUNNY is full of emotion.  The slow pace sometimes harms the movie.  But at times, the snail's pace lets the viewer absorb what is happening and digest it, letting the emotion of the movie bloom in full.The movie works best as a road trip film.  I enjoyed going across the country with Vincent in his van.When it came time for various characters to sit around talking to each other, I started to tune out.  None of the characters were nearly as interesting as the American landscape as seen from Vincent's van windows.  Yet the only dialog scene that brought the movie to a dead stop was the scene with the grandparents (and the title bunny).  It actually took awhile for me to get back into the movie after an eternity of sitting around the kitchen table with these elderly people who had nothing to say.  I wish this scene had been cut out entirely, or at least trimmed to a quarter of it's current length.I did enjoy the interaction with Daisy at the end of the movie.  And the controversial oral sex scene did not disrupt the film for me... it just seemed like what those two characters would do at that point in the story.  It did not de-rail the film and it was refreshingly honest.Though not really pulled off with a lot of filmmaking expertise, I did like what the final (flashback) scenes of THE BROWN BUNNY were trying to say.Gallo's DIY filmmaking is wonderfully daring, but I wish he would let others in on the process from time to time.  I appreciate the freedom he has as an artist, but perhaps surrounding himself with more crew would add more quality to his film.  It is hard to get past the many out-of-focus and poorly framed shots in THE BROWN BUNNY.Overall, THE BROWN BUNNY is not great cinema... but it is worth a look if you are open-minded.",The Brown Bunny
252564,"Stephen King's movie adaptation ""Pet Sematary"" is a unique horror movie with some very good qualities. With that being said, it is true that this movie is also an eye roller at times as well.  However, overall, ""Pet Sematary"" is one of the scariest movies (if not the scariest) of the last 16-17 years...Mary Lambert and company do a great job of painting a very dark picture and producing an evil, morbid and downright scary atmosphere with this movie.The movie starts out with what appears to be a perfect family moving to a ridiculous location on a highway that has constant 18-wheel trucks driving through at 70 miles per hour...not exactly the best location for a cozy home for two small children and a cat. However, there are stupid people in this world and Louis, played by Dale Midkiff, is probably the stupidest character I have seen in a long time with regard to horror movies.The plot basically involves this ""perfect"" family and their adapting to their new home which has some interesting and dark history behind it that centers on an old Micmac indian burial ground and a ""pet sematary""...the former is an evil place with sour soil from all the corpses placed their over so many years and the latter is a ""place of rest and speaking"" according to Jud, played brilliantly by Fred Gwynne.The movie begins to pick up speed when Ellie's cat is run over by a truck one night and Jud decides to introduce Louis to the power of the ole Micmac indian burial ground which is a very creepy part as the two hike through and to what seems like a very evil place. The score of the movie here really adds to the creepy feeling and mood the audience receives through this part.Jud's character is clearly the most interesting in my opinion because he knows the history behind ""pet sematary"" and the old Micmac indian burial ground which is the location of this ancient evil. Louis's question to Jud, ""Has anyone ever buried a person up there?"" causes Jud to almost go mad at just hearing such a question. Obviously, this takes this movie to what is going to happen next and I will not spoil it for you, but suffice it to say, this movie is filled with dark subplots, e.g. Rachael's creepy sister story, the history of the evil burial ground and Missy's depressing health situation which ends in her suicide.Overall, this is a very good horror movie which could have been great or a ""classic"", but it sadly goes south towards the ending as the manifestation of this evil comes across ridiculously and those of you who have seen the film know what I am talking about. Also, Dale Midkiff's character, Louis, is so stupid to turn his back on his 3 year old son while on a picnic near ""that damn road"" as Jud calls it. Dale Midkiff is not a very good actor and his performance detracts somewhat from the effectiveness of this horror flick.Nevertheless, this is a VERY DARK and creepy horror flick that deserves respect in the horror genre and earns a place on my horror movie DVD shelf. I affectionately give ""Pet Sematary"" 4.25 STARS, which might be a bit generous because although the movie had such promise from the beginning, ""Pet Sematary"" fades a bit towards the latter half and the ending is not entirely satisfying as well.  Still, ""Pet Sematary"" is a very good horror movie, bordering on greatness, and this movie could have gotten 4.5 STARS in my opinion...alas, that was not the case and that's why the movie deserves just over FOUR STARS to recognize its darkly imaginative brilliance but also to express disappointment for the parts of this flick which prevent it from attaining 4.5 or maybe even 5 STARS status.""Pet Sematary"" is a must own for any serious horror movie fan and is one of the better Stephen King adaptations. I highly recommend this movie, but my criticism comes from my disappointment as it is clear this movie had tremendous promise in the beginning, but fails to follow through and for that reason cannot quite be considered one of the elite horror movies of alltime, although it is still very good to near great and definitely an entertaining horror movie overall.  As a horror movie viewer, you should have an awful good time watching ""Pet Sematary"" for the first time.",N/A

The music selection on this tour was outstanding, the sound was outstanding and the lads seemed to really enjoy themselves.  One could hope that they'll continue to do so, but one never knows, do they?The only things I'd have like to had done better is to have the camera operators know who was going to play what at what time.  They sometimes had the camera on one bandmember while another was really jamming on his instrument.  There were some times when I'd have liked to see Rick Wakeman's fingers flying across the keyboards during one of his spotlights rather than watching another bandmember keeping the beat.  Get in there close and tight and see Howe or Squire bending the strings.  That's the only thing I'd say that's keeping me from giving this a five.

348864,"I will have to agree with some of the other reviewers, that this movie was fluffed, and a little too careful with the production of this movie.  I feel that the director could have definitely included the incestuous act, as it would add a little more spice to it.  I mean it was interesting to the point where it made you not want to leave until you found out what was going to happen, but if you collect movies like most of us, and you will be watching this more than once, then it could use some excitement.  Excellent story line, and in the beginning, how their father died and they had to resort to living back home, where she escaped from years ago.Now, because of the mom's incestuous relationship with the children's father, how the grandmother  was going to punish them all for the mothers sins,including the mom. very sick. very interesting.At the end, I would have liked to see more reaction from the mother's wedding party when the children finally escape from the attic and tell everyone during the ceremony of the mom's marriage, how they were locked in the attic all that time and how the younger son was poisoned by his own mother, AND NOW HERE SHE IS GETTING MARRIED TO A MAN WHO HAD NO IDEA SHE EVEN HAD CHILDREN.  The mom, falls off the balcony and dies, the grandmother never pays for what she's done and is still alive, and the groom, just stood there with a slightly shocked look on his face. COME ON??????!

608603,"I was determined to wait for this movie on DVD to see it, but after hearing a bunch of ""it's so much better than the first two"" I buckled in and went.  Once again, I found out that the service of a memory weighed in more than the actual quality of new product for fans easily subjected to a Jedi mind trick, again.This movie isn't better than ""Episode I"" or ""II"" - it's as bad or worse.  If you think more screen time for Hayden can help anything, the force runs kind of weak in you.Here's what we have:  a lot of chaotic action sequences stringing together the main plot point; Darth Vader turns to the Dark Side to save his wife and children, doomed to die at childbirth.We see how Darth Vader came to be.  Sounds great, right?  But Hayden's acting, already horrible at best, sinks further and further into deliveries that would shame a high school student - just in time for the all-important transformation.  With all of the money spent on this film, would a few more takes to get a credible performance for the finale broken the bank?The Emperor also has a large part in this film.  I loved this character in Return of the Jedi, but he is stripped of all his power and poise in Sith, becoming more pedestrian as the plot plods on. In fact, die hard fans will easily recognize signiture lines in this film, lifted from Jedi.  I was embarassed, frankly.Oh - and I almost forgot - Annakin kills a bunch of ""Youngling"" Jedi.  (This has gotten a lot of press.)  What they forgot to tell you was this was the first and last time you ever saw the Jedi Youth.  Deaths only have inpact when the characters mean something.

Under the supervision of three doctors and his vegan girlfriend, Spurlock goes on a 30 day diet exclusively at McDonald's and with no exercise.  He must eat everything off the menu at least once, and if asked to supersize his meal, he must say ""yes.""  It's not surprising that Morgan's heath deteriorates in those 30 days, but I (and neither did Spurlock, probably) didn't imagine that it would deteriorate so badly.

46455,"When ""Jaws"" was released on DVD five years ago, the package skimped on extras, provided a whittled-down version of an originally two-hour documentary, and scrapped the original, Oscar-winning sound mix in favor of a surround-sound modernization that was often less effective than what moviegoers heard circa-1975. There was an online petition a few years ago signed by many ardent ""Jaws"" fans (a/k/a finsters) calling for a better DVD issue. I'm one of the ""Jaws"" geeks who signed that petition, and this DVD set is for us.Anyone buying ""Jaws"" on DVD for the first time with this set will get a choice of the original monoraul mix, or DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mixes (both of which include some cheesy new sound effects not heard in the original) along with the full-length documentary originally produced for the 1995 laserdisc edition, and some additional extras. Still not as many extras as there could have been, but this set is more generous in that regard than the 2000 release. Picture quality is identical to the earlier DVD, which looked fine for the most part. Finsters naturally will opt for the mono soundtrack and sit through the entire documentary, reveling in the story of one of the most problem-plagued Hollywood productions ever. DVD consumers with less of an emotional attachment to the movie will question the need to invest in this package over the one-disc DVD from 2000, and I can't say I blame them.Whichever DVD you buy,  though (and stick with the letterboxed version, please--panning-and-scanning wrecks the movie's visual coherence), ""Jaws"" has long since become an inadvertent classic, with at least two of its best characteristics--Steven Spielberg's emphasis on implied threat rather than overexposure of the giant shark, and the lead actors' nuanced performances--forced on it by the endless special-effects delays.

796831,Sally Kirkland gave the best role of her career with this haunting portrait of a middle aged actress who decides to cast in USA after being a very well known actress in her birth country.The struggling atmosphere and the winds of change experimented by Anna make the dramatic frame to receive her parent. You will realize how fast and temporal can result the affective ties when the greed and the ambition sharp the spirit.The profound sensation of loneliness due the age in the acting world is the central focus of this intelligent and sensitive film. What can be the pretext to ignore the talent and experience of an actress whose only sin has been to surpass the forties? The acquired experience weighs less than nothing when the first wrinkles delineate the feminine face. It would seem that Faustian stigma has survived through the years and has embodied in the common sense of many people.A mature film who could become in a vital reference point and late discussion after you watch this picture.,Anna

410317,"Like a sweet dream half-remembered, ""Chungking Express"" wavers on the back of your consciousness, seducing you into its semi-fantasy/semi-honest world of the chance of romance, and the necessity of proximity (0.01 of a centimeter is the distance of attraction) to filling an empty heart.  It is appropriate that ""California Dreaming"" is the background for much of the film, because dreaming is what the characters do, moving sluggishly through a life not quite real.It is difficult to know what to make of the film at first.  There are two stories, interspersed with each other in through the film, both love stories involving policemen, a deli shop, and women whom they would love. Unlike ""Pulp Fiction,"" they do not meet up at the end, and the strangers remain strangers.  There is no neat package.  Rather, like Banana Yoshimoto's novels, they are linked thematically, with the same tale being told with different cast members, to see how each person finds their own ending, regardless of the beginning.  While Yoshimoto is Japanese, and Kar Wai is Chinese, there is a similarity in Asian story-telling evident in ""Chungking Express.""As to this DVD, while it is great to see Quentin Tarantino bring Kar Wai's films to a wider audience, I find his commentary a bit annoying and self-serving.  Taratino makes some great flicks, and Kar Wai is an obvious influence on him, but he doesn't have the personality to comment on something so sweet and subtle as ""Chungking Express.""  This is just a personal observation, however, and others may disagree.Director Kar Wai Wong is a rising star of cinema, seeping to the public consciousness slowly and surely, becoming less of a ""Hong Kong Director"" and more of an important contributor to modern film.  ""Chungking Express"" is a fine introduction to his work, showcasing his subtle love stories, use of atmosphere and disorientating techniques, such as multiple-languages and film manipulation.  Anyone who has seen ""Lost in Translation,"" ""Amelie"" or ""Kill Bill"" will find his films familiar.",Chungking Express VHS
607945,"Going in I assumed this was a film about a suave player (Campbell Scott) who was charm women & end up passing this skill down to his nephew. I was only half right. During the set up we actually find out that he's sort of a prick. If he likes you he uses his elocutionary skills flatter you. If he's having a bad day he using them to debase you. Then his 16 yr. old nephew enters the picture & asks for help with the ladies. Normally he might not ""waste"" his time in helping another human being, but I believe it creates a nice distraction from the current turbulation in his life. This film primarily takes place during one night. Scott BSs his way throughout the evening trying to teach his nephew a thing or 2. They interact with a couple of chicks at a bar, Elizabeth Berkley who I enjoy & Jennifer Beals who I find highly overrated. They like the boy's naivetivity. Scott then continues the night trying to get the boy laid while the night gets seamier & seamier. There is definitely some truthfullness in this movie, such as when Scott tells his nephew about the closing time scenario in which everyone gets depressed & just don't want to be alone. In the end it seems that the nephew may have learned a thing or 2 even though he'd probably retain his sweetness. Scott may or may not change, but I think it's more about the scene & lonliness than any one or 2 characters. This film really does seem to push you into the movie. I often felt uncomfortable, just like in real life. This is the look the filmmakers were going for & it really worked for me.",Roger Dodger

But, who cares when you have Mel Gibson at his handsome peak (something which has now peaked), and blue-eyed Elijah Wood filling in the saccharin when blue-eyed Mel is taking a rest. The fact is, Forever Young works on all levels.Old plot-man is suspended in time and wakes up in the future-zowie! Needs to adjust. Needs to find answers. Finds shelter and danger. A mixture of Always and Blast from the Past, Forever Young makes the old formula work by throwing in some-more old formulas. Take a love affair that almost was, but can never be. Add a desolation that has no bounds. Give it a margin of escape, into a world of cryogenics. Diffuse the sci-fi out of the picture. No one cares about the how and why (except George Wendt, who froze a chicken and brought it back to life and David Marshall Grant and his FBI cronies). Have the hero wake up, scare some nosey kids, get naked, wear women's clothes, and show up at the doorstep of a not-so-perfect household, but a not-that-dysfunctional one as well.What makes Forever Young endearing (and enduring as a classic) is Daniel's search for an answer from a man who is dead for many years; and of course, his still undying love for Helen (Isabel Glasser) even with the presence of Claire Cooper (Jamie Lee Curtis) to add sexual tension. Like the Billy Holiday theme song- ""The very thought of you,"" the absence of a true love can still provoke an unquenchable yearning; and Mel Gibson does a bang up job of convincing us that despite 50 years missing, he is still the same old fashioned, 1939 guy in love with a woman who is far removed.Not necessary to the plot, but central to Forever Young's success is the then eleven year old Elijah Wood, who for one of the very few times in his seventeen year acting career, needs to play a kid. Most of his character portrayals of young folk are children deeply wounded or in the grips of Adult drama. In Forever Young he has the challenge of finding a character arc that really is not in the script. He finds one (bully for him), and has his character, Nat Cooper, rise above its meagerness, adding humor, sweetness, excitement and, well-I hate to say it, but he makes us feel Forever Young. The film is about the old folk finding youth. But, define Youth. Ah! That definition is supplied by none other than Elijah Wood, despite the acting challenge and his own personal flagging against the part during the film's shooting.Of course, the twist ending is perfect-something akin to To Each His Own or Imitation of Life (not the remake-the Original with Claudette Colbert). Overall, a peaceful, warm film, Forever Young will remain Forever Popular. Maybe because it offends no one, makes for a good Saturday afternoon DVD watch, and is, frankly my dear, a damn good film.

One century ago, men like Big existed in New York like that character in the Wharton's novel, Archer who enjoyed a certain kind of woman, but will not marry her, he needed a society girl (a wife material)like May (or Natasha)for wife, and a entertainment girl at side, hidden somewhere. Carrie should have taken the cue when Big would not introduce her to his mother. For men, there are always girls to have fun with and girls that you marry for good.

It just sucks you in and never lets go. If you ask me this film got cheated out of winning best picture from Dances with Wolves which doesn't even come close to this movie.

937729,"Wallace and Gromit are back, in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit, and it was worth the wait.For those not familiar with the Wallace and Gromit franchise, it's a set of movie shorts, in which the characters are all portrayed in claymation. Wallace is the mild-mannered Englishman inventor and cheese-lover, and Gromit is his faithful dog. You get the sense that Gromit is sometimes the brighter of the two.Let me preview the plot without spoiling the movie. As the story opens, W&G; are running a garden-protection security outfit, protecting all the neighbours' gardens through a combination of a motion detection system and their own muscle. Rabbits are the big scourge of the neighbourhood, and W&G; are under some pressure to keep the neighborhood safe in advance of the upcoming fair, where the fruits of the gardeners' labours will be judged. W&G; have caught a large number of rabbits, but are loathe to kill them. So, what to do? Wallace's ingenious solution has unintended consequences for the neighborhood, the fair, and the duo.It's definitely a British production, in terms of characterization, setting, etc. The plasticene models appear more detailed in this film, relative to the previous productions. The film is a little more action-oriented, and there are visual allusions to various Hollywood movies, at least in my eyes: Frankenstein, Temple of Doom, Jaws, An American Werewolf in London (and thereby Thriller) all come to mind.A great movie, with thrills and laughs, for the entire family!",N/A
371404,"It's hard to fathom all the outrage and controversy over ""Exit To Eden"", a great sexy comedy that actually lives up to its billing on both counts.  For the record, this a fun, at times farcical (in the very best sense of the word - over-the-top humor based on unlikely but highly comedic incidents) Fantasy - what they call in publishing circles a 'bedtime story for adults' - and it's not - repeat Not - a sadomasochistic film (I hardly think a few quick flicks with a hairbrush counts as being on par with the really depraved stuff).A pair of detectives (well played by Dan Akroyd and Rosie O'Donnell) end up going undercover on an island resort after a cartel of thieves.  The island itself is a 'sexual paradise' type getaway reigned over by a 'dominatrix' (although quite a softie of one; as noted this is fun fantasy and not a gritty serious drama) played by the magnificent Dana Delaney.  Guests to the island can opt to be a pseudo-master or pseudo-slave with the other guests.  For all the wild nature of the concept there's a lot of welcome tenderness and characters really falling in love, along with all the welcome unabashed sexuality and exposure (the number of gorgeous girls in here is perhaps second only to ""Dream Trap"", possibly the sexiest movie of all time [And STILL without a DVD release!  Grrrr...:( ], with a giddy air and the best themes of a caper comedy.  If you're lucky enough to get married this is a movie to be taken along on the honeymoon to act out scenes in the privacy of your own honeymoon cabin or suite.  Take along a couple of DiVinyls CDs for the soundtrack too (they're not on the film soundtrack, but my goodness they should have been.  Talk about fitting in well).

180803,"I think the best way to describe ""Playing God,"" the film that David Duchovny did during his summer off from ""The X-Files"" in 1977, is that the actor tried playing the self-destructive character who is the protagonist of the film and then reached a point where he decided it was better to have fun with the role.  What follows could not be considered to be too little, but it really does come too late for director Andy Wilson's film to really work.The premise is certainly interesting enough.  Dr. Eugene Sands (David Duchovny) is a defrocked doctor who lost his license to practice medicine when he tried performing surgery drugged out of his mind and killed a patient.  Down in the depths of despair Sands is out trying to score some heroin in a bar where bad things happen when something bad happens and one of the customers is blown away.  Sands offers the sage medical advice that 911 should be called, but it seems that would actually be a bad thing so he ends up doing a MacGuyver-style version of meatball surgery to save the guy.Two interesting things happen as a result of this incident.  The first is that Sands remembers that being a doctor was an even bigger rush than what he got from drugs.  The second is that Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton), who has lots of ill-gotten gain, arranges a meeting with Sands and gives him $10,000.  This is a way for Blossom to say thanks for saving his friend but it is also an invitation for Sands to be a doctor again.  He will not have a license, but he will get to practice medicine and on some rather interesting patients while some even more interesting interested parties look on.Complicating the offer is Gage (Michael Massee), an F.B.I. agent who knows about the deal that Blossom is giving Sands and wants to use that information to force little fish Sands to give him big fish Blossom.  Then there is Claire (Angelina Jolie), Blossom's mistress, who pouts at Sands in a provocative way.  But since Blossom is the sort of person who pays Sands to bring back someone from the dead just so they can be killed, trying to take Claire away from him is not going to be a good idea.  Of course, Sands will try.The best and worst scenes in this movie are a pair of surgery scenes that show that Duchovny's instincts on how to play the part are at odds with the initial drama.  The worst is when we flashback to see the botched surgery that cost Sands his license.  Show me just this clip and I would pass on seeing the movie.  The best is when Sands has to do another impromptu surgery, this time in a biker bar.  The setting, the characters, and the performances really work, but they run against the grain of the entire set up of the film.  But it represents the part of the film where Duchovny finally finds a way of making the character work.  The only thing wrong with this is that the wisecracking Sands does not really flow from the situation.Actually I rounded down on this one because I thought Timothy Hutton's over the top villain was too over the top.  I liked his coldly calculating moments a lot better than his ranting and raving madman moments, but it is the latter that comes to dominate the end of the film.  The climax tries to speak at some sort of friendship between the two that makes what has come to pass somewhat ironic, but no such relationship was really established here.Ultimately, Duchovny gets more of this film than the audience, because ""Playing God"" clearly teaches him where his strengths as an actor lie in making movies.  He has such an easy-going charm and wry sense of humor that you hope for his wife's sake he is not really acting.  In his follow up theatrical efforts, ""Return to Me,"" ""Evolution"" and ""Connie and Carla"" he clearly plays to his strong suits.  Unfortunately the limited release yesterday of ""House of D,"" written and directed by Duchovny, did not open here in the Zenith City.  I was really looking forward to seeing that flm as his next big move in his career.",N/A

782068,"'Devil's Pond' is a movie that tries to be suspenseful, sometimes shocking, but the final outcome is weak and unconvincing. The story is not original and - most of all - is not gripping and tense.A young middle class woman (Tara Reid) married with a young and handsome guy (Pardue) just to find out in a few days that her husband is a psycho and a really violent one. He imprisioned her in a kind of island in the center of a lake and there start her nightmare and her fight to break free.In fact, that's all the story here. And a story without any background to give any motive at all to the sick personality of the husband. The characters seem to be launched in an absurd situation just to play during ninety minutes a ludicrous and lame game of cat and mouse. Because of that, in a few minutes the viewer became tired with the movie and loses all the interest with the destiny of poor and beautiful Julianne, played by Tara Reid.I think that a good suspense movie needs more than violence, screams and a psycho characther with a mad look on his face to be a really good movie. 'Devil's Pond' seems to pay little respect to this point.",N/A

But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the ""desperate"", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore.",N/A

506792,"I enjoyed this DVD because, as a child, I loved the Oz books. I even enjoyed the Judy Garland movie, although it a lot of liberties with the book. In a similar way, I enjoyed this one.The DVD story is a conflation of the 2nd and 3rd Oz books: The Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. The preponderance is towards the latter. The characters in the film are very much in keeping with Baum's characterizations in his books and even tend to look like the John R. Neill illustrations.The biggest deviation from the original comes in the first 20 minutes. It has virtually nothing in common with the books and the idea of Dorothy being stuck in a mental hospital is a bit jarring. That being said, the young lady playing the part is very much like the young, innocent and extremely polite character Baum conceived. This is in contrast to Judy Garland who was much older and more sophisticated.Persons looking for a strict adaptation of the book will be dissapointed to the same degree dissapointment was experienced with the classic movie. This one does not have the big production numbers of a Hollywood musical; that may be a loss for some but is a plus for me. Take this movie for what it is, a loose adaptation of beloved books.",N/A

738995,"Baba Ram Dass was one of the major spiritual influences in my life during the early '70's. I discovered his books and tapes just about the time I decided to change my college major from Anthropology to Religious Studies. It's books like: 'Be Here Now', 'The Only Dance There Is' and more recently 'Still Here' that continue to break through my rigidity of thought and open my mind and heart to new vistas of understanding and acceptance.I had the priviledge of meeting Ram Dass back in '76 after a talk he gave at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, CA. During that brief moment in his presence I experienced an unmistakable flow of energy emanating from this ex-Harvard professor, turned subversive LSD user, turned Hindi guru and devotee of Hanuman, the Monkey-God. I felt totally alive, empowered and so bursting with emotion that I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.Through the years I've met, or stood in the presence of numerous famous spiritual figures from a wide variety of faiths and traditions and I can honestly say that I've never experienced anything comparable to what enveloped me that night in '76 as I looked into the smiling, grandfatherly face of Ram Dass.Seeing Ram Dass old, infirmed and confined to a wheelchair since his stroke in '97 takes a little getting used to, but once you gaze deeply into those mischevous eyes and see that knowing smile you realize he hasn't changed a bit. At least not concerning the things that really matter. 'Fierce Grace' is a magnificent visual document presenting one mans' commitment to love, endurance and living life ""in the moment."" His teachings and attitude have remained as clear and consistent today as they were thirty-five years ago; humorous, insightful, deeply personal and above all compassionate.RAM...........................................................",Ram Dass: Fierce Grace
802069,"When looking at Disney's early releases, it's surprising to see how many ""classics"" there is: Bambi, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and many others. Yet in recent years things haven't been so kind to them. Besides the technologically impressive but emotionally hollow Fantasia 2000, Disney hasn't really done a really great film. Home on the Range, Treasure Planet, Brother Bear don't really have the timeless quality that previous releases had. Enter an emerging line of japanese films and the films by Pixar to fill the gap. So we have the third film from the director of Perfect Blue and Millenium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers.Gin is a middle-aged ex-cycling champ. Hana is a proud but kind of pathetic drag queen while Miyuki is a runaway teenager. All of them have troubled pasts and issues which they confront once they find an abandoned baby, which they name Kiyoko. They decide to return the baby to its rightful parents only they end up meeting some interesting people such as a mob-type person, a spanish hitman, Hana's old group and some rather mean kids.There's a certain charm with the film where you start caring about the characters even if it's not big on action sequences which is something that's really missing with today films. Watching the film there is a certain leap of faith you have to take since many of the film moments will ""yeah right, as if that would happen"" but the film's meant to be touching and sentimental so you can blame the filmmakers for being really sappy.Really disappointing are the extras. You get ""2"". I put 2 in quotations marks cause there's actually just one. A kind-of informative making-of which has interviews with the director and the 3 leads(I had no idea Miyuki's voice actor was so damn hot) and it has 2 interviews, the first being the best. The interviewer talks too damn much. The 2nd extra is actually just trailers. Whoopee.With films like Spirited Away, this one and others, maybe there's a new animation group we should be looking at. Only since it's animation from Japan, it probably won't get the recognition it deserves. Too bad.",Tokyo Godfathers
562250,"The stars and planets must have been aligned just right when Eric Idle and Neil Innes got together to make this brilliant movie.  With an in-depth knowledge of the Beatles, Idle (who plays the McCartney-esque character, Dirk) satires the history of the Fab Four.  Innes (Nasty, the John Lennon-like character) demonstrated an uncanny ability to write songs that both make fun of and pay tribute to the Beatles.  As mentioned by other reviewers, his songs stand alone admirably.  Without the combination of great story line and songs, the movie would have flopped.This movie is not a ""mockumentary"", just as Neil Innes is not Weird Al Yankovic.  Despite the satire, there is an aura of respect for the Beatles that shines through.  The deleted scenes with Mick Jagger and Paul Simon illustrate this point; when you watch the interviews, although they say the word ""Rutles"", you know that they are thinking ""Beatles"".There is a joyful vibe that permeates the entire film.  It looks like it was a joy to make.  And despite being made in 1978, it is as timeless as the Beatles themselves.  I highly recommend this movie to all Beatles fans.One last thing:  For you older SNL fans, look for a cameo by a youthful Al Franken.",N/A
283707,"""Never So Few"" is a film with kind of a split personality.  When it concerns itself with battle sequences and the waging of the war it is interesting.  Unfortunately, the film devotes too much time to a romantic subplot involving star Frank Sinatra and Gina Lollobrigida that is not only a distraction but goes nowhere.  Lollobrigida is a stunner, but let's face it, her acting ability is the consistency of wood.  What redeems the film is the main story involving the soldiers who fought on the Burmese front.  The film also poses the question as to the nature of honor in the time of conflict.  Is it more honorable to follow the book or when you take the law in your own hands when it is morally justified?  Sinatra is solid as maverick Captain Tom Reynolds.  Steve McQueen, in his first major motion picture(well, maybe ""The Blob""), nearly steals the show as streetwise Cpl. Bill Ringa.  Good supporting turns are on display here by Richard Johnson as Reynold's British subordinate, Charles Bronson as a Navajo code talker, and old hand Brian Donlevy as the General.",N/A
863304,"""The Twilight Zone"" has seen a number of releases within the past score of years; the oldest one being by CBS Video Library which was sold by Columbia House from the early 1990s, later re-vamped onto DVD. Image Entertainment picked up the torch in 1999 when they released the entire series on DVD, but like Columbia House before them, Image did not disc the episodes in chronological order of airdate. Gold Entertainment released the series appropriately in 2000, correcting this long-standing inconvenience. There was also the release of ""Treasures from The Twilight Zone"" by CBS in 1992, which included five episodes from the series plus Rod Serling's initial network pitch which sold the series, and an interview with Mike Wallace done in 1959, prior to the show's original airing.2005 sees the re-release of the entire ""Twilight Zone"" canon by Image Entertainment; ""Twilight Zone"" is reportedly Image Entertainment's number-one selling DVD item, over and above every other product they sell.The earlier discs, which can still be ordered online from any number of outlets, have supplemental material written by Marc Scott Zicree, aka 'The Twilight Zone guru', who has spent the better part of thirty years on ""Twilight Zone""-related projects. Trivia quizzes, episode and season synopses, actor profiles, and other tidbits written by Zicree are included on the previous discs for more-than-casual fans, aided by clever and easy-to-navigate menus. The navigation of the present series of discs is not quite as effective; the same montages used on the Columbia House versions were utilized, and the viewer does not have the option to 'play all' the episodes on the disc at once (each episode has its own menu with chapters, and there is a sub-menu inconspicuously nestled in for each episode's special features, including commentary tracks.)The picture quality of both Image's and Gold's earlier discs was good overall, but a number of digital bloopers occur in nearly every episode. Image has supposedly re-mastered the footage from the original prints for the most recent release but this is more or less imperceptible for most of the episodes.Aside from a few nice added bonus features, ""Twilight Zone: The Definitive Edition"" looks to be yet another example of how Hollywood production companies jam-pack the product with goodies instead of focusing on quality and distinguishedness of the content and its presentation. The six-disc Volume 1 set comes with an unceremoniously tacked-on version of Zicree's somewhat controversial ""Companion"" guide to the series. Published in 1982, this is a book that every fan of the series likely already owns, and which over the years has garnered a reputation for slapdash treatment and commentary of the episodes. Zicree's magnetic-tape interviews with directors Douglas Heyes, Richard L. Bare, writer Richard Matheson, producer Buck Houghton and several others, are tacked on in the menu's Bonus Features section. If you can overlook the interviewer's approbing utterances of ""mhmm"" after nearly every sentence spoken by the interviewees, these are enjoyable.The notoriously ineffectual Radio Dramas (produced by Falcon Picture Group) - radio adaptations of many episodes, are included, presumably the result of a business deal aimed to promote a failing product. One has the option of listening to Kim Fields (""Tootie"" on the TV series The Facts of Life) drive the ultra-classic episode ""The After Hours"" into the ground after (or before!) watching Anne Francis spin Rod Serling's words into gold. Isolated scores for several episodes are included, but the only way the viewer can listen to them is against the backdrop of a silent version of the episode - that's right, you can listen to the music as you watch the characters mouthing all the dialogue. Surely the scores could have been released on the disc as MP3 files that could be played on most DVD players. Audio commentaries by stars Rod Taylor, Earl Holliman, Martin Milner, Martin Landau, and Kevin McCarthy and also former CBS President William Self are included. Inasmuch as it would've been nice to see these guys on camera again after so many years, their comments about the old days are splendid, despite a general lack of remembrance about working on the series (Milner spends a good three or four minutes discussing his current activities as host of a radio show on deep-sea fishing.)A sixth bonus DVD offers segments of the game show ""The Liars Club,"" (a real hoot, featuring Betty White and Dick Gautier on the panel of liars!); a gallery of photos with about ten commonly-seen production shots, a sales pitch of Serling's to a Netherlands network, and a blooper of Serling while filming the intro to the fourth season episode ""He's Alive."" A complete ""Twilight Zone"" comic book is also included, in PDF (Adobe Acrobat Reader) format, which can be viewed on computer.Thankfully, Image included the Rod Serling bumpers for next week's episodes, something which fans of the series have sought after for many years, and also the middle and ending billboards of Kimberly Clark and Sanka, ""Twilight Zone""'s sponsors of the first season. Clips of Serling claiming his two Emmys are welcome inclusions, as are two lectures Rod did around 1970 at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College, a seminar-based college in the Los Angeles area which featured lectures by such industry giants as Serling. The audio tracks for these were superimposed over the video tracks of ""Where Is Everybody,"" ""Walking Distance,"" and ""And When the Sky Was Opened"" (we assume these three episodes were the subject of Serling's lectures.) The track for ""Walking Distance,"" considered to be among the top five episodes of the series, is quite surprising as Serling denounces the storyline as flawed and illogical.The same format and general content look to be the same for Seasons 2 through 5.Fans of ""The Twilight Zone"" would probably do well to save $250-300 pick up a used copy of Gold Entertainment's complete version - minus the aforementioned bells and whistles.And if you're thinking about leaving negative feedback for this review, you need to accept reviews that tell it like it is, even if the comments aren't brimming with praise!",The Twilight Zone: Season 1

When Marcos and Juan walk down a busy street, Marcos points out all the hustles. The scammers are all around them. ""They're there,"" he says to Juan, ""but you can't see them. That's what it's all about. They're there, but they aren't. So mind your briefcase, your door, your window, your car, your savings. Mind your rear. Because they're there and they'll always be."" ""Thieves,"" says Juan. ""No...that's what everybody calls them. They are spitters, breakers, skin workers, blind fronts, hoisters, hooks, stalls, petermans, night raiders, mustard-chuckers, fences, operators, swindlers. I'm hungry. Let's go to my office and get a meal."" And they step into a near-by bar where Marcos owes money.Marcos has conned and cheated everyone who has ever dealt with him, including former partners, his sister and his younger brother. Now he comes across what will be the biggest con of his career. It involves the nine queens, a sheet of stamps from the Weimar Republic, defective, rare and extremely valuable. Marcos and Juan need a set of forged stamps, which they can get, and the real stamps, which they can get but only for a high price. And they can give the mark, a shrewd crook of a wealthy businessman who collects stamps and is being deported the next day, no time to thoroughly check the goods. Juan and Marcos' sister will prove instrumental in the deal.I had to watch the movie twice. First, to really follow the intricate plot. Second, to fully appreciate that the director/writer wasn't hiding any cards. If you know what to look for, you just might figure out the movie. Marcos' lecture to Juan about all those scammers has a point that you'll look back on with a smile. Third, to find out some things, you need to pay close attention to the little details. An off-hand remark or bit of background history later becomes important to a piece of action. Why this movie is so good is that the first time you watch it you're taken off guard by the scams within scams. But the second time, it's sheer pleasure in seeing how these scams are being set up.The actors do a fine job. Pauls brings a combination of innocence, likeability and shrewdness to the role. Darrin can be charming, but he also makes his character a man you'd trust only if you had no alternative.If you like puzzles you'll probably like this movie. There are cons within cons, scams and slights of hand. You might find the final con a stretch, but it's satisfying. There are no extras of any significance. The DVD transfer looks great.",N/A
881359,"We've seen this trick before.  Come for our AWESOME plane crash then stay for our dreck. The thought being that the people there don't care about plot and characters and things of that nature so why even bother. We saw it with ""Executive Decision"" and ""Under Siege 2,"" and Hollywood never thinks it gets old.  Not that this dreck is all that bad, but it is certainly straight out of the Hollywood playbook.  If they had kept it as a psychological thriller then maybe I could have recommended this film. Rather they felt the need to throw in gun fights and explosions and things of that nature just so that it felt like a real action picture.  Also, the ending was so contrived and predictable that it destroyed any chance I had for liking this movie (what do you think happens when somebody has five chances to do something?).  This movie also had a fair share of other problems.  Some of the one-liners in this film could make your hair curl (""Somebody turn out the lights""). Whoever wrote this should consider themselves lucky that they didn't have to read their own lines out loud in front of a camera.  There was also the much criticized scene in which they play the song ""Hey Ya"" by OutKast. Of course we all know that some overpaid over-educated producer thought that was the best way to appeal to the kids, but they totally botched the delivery of the song.  If they had just played it in the background and left the characters out of it then it could have fit into this little tale of escapism.  However, they had the characters actually listening to it out in the middle of the desert and expending valuable energy dancing to it.  Now we all know OutKast is catchy, but it came off as one big commercial for them in that scene.  On the positive side the acting by Giovanni Ribisi and Dennis Quaid was very good (anybody else find it ironic that Quaid's career is hotter right now than Meg Ryan's?), unfortunately they were surrounded by a bunch of overacting hacks who had no clue as to how to read a line.  There were also some very cool camera shots that work because they fit into the film.  This film wanted to be nothing more than mass entertainment, and I have to give it to them they were pretty entertaining. That is a lot more than ""the Grudge"" can say. However, that can not erase all the aforementioned problems, so I'm not going to recommend it, but only by a hair.  ***",Flight of the Phoenix

731577,"Ok, let's face it. I got it to look at Diesel in the tight t-shirt, which in my humble opinion, is a darn good reason for renting the thing if nothing else.On the other hand, there may be those who want more in a movie: a plot, good actors, action, etc. You're in luck. This movie has that, too. You not only have greats Dennis Hopper and John Malkovich, but also some young men who definately will be greats in their own time, like Barry Pepper, Andrew Devoli, Seth Green, and the reason I bought the flick -- Vin Diesel.Matty (Barry Pepper), convinced as a child that he was not ""up"" to being a mobster, has been trying to get a straight job but keeps getting shot down because his father is the infamous Benny Chains (Dennis Hopper). My first thought here was ""Why not move to another state where folks have no idea who Benny Chains is?"", which was the reaction in a small Montana town but I guess that would have killed the story.Anyway, he finally convinces Dad to trust him with a money delievery which goes very wrong. His pal, Marbles (Seth Green), gets paniced and loses the money bag. (Knowing Marbles was a former junkie, why didn't Matty go with him?) Matty is desperate to get the bag back and enlists help from a couple of friends, Chris Scarpa (Andrew Davoli), and Taylor Reese (Vin Diesel).PLOT SPOILER -I'm editing here after the rebulk from someone about this part. I've apologized...  Now -- I'm not a Seth Green fan. However, his death scene was absolutely wonderful. I was surprised at how he handled it. He did as much with simple expressions as some actors could with a page full of lines. Very well done.  Vin Diesel seems to do better in movies (Pitch Black aside) where he is not the main character. As a backup he is consistantly very good. No exception here. He is the bad boy in the group. (In his first scene no one ever explained WHY he bashed in his own machines before roughing up the owner of the store. Seemed pointless to me...)  Onward.  THE FIGHT SCENE.  In order to get information they decide they need to find out who the toughest guy in town is, beat the crap out of him, and take it from there. They find the guy who isn't the least bit afraid of them. As he and Diesel stand nose to nose, Vin takes off his jacket (once my breathing normalized I noticed the bad guy had much the same reaction as myself!) and starts his ""500 fights"" monologue. This is obviously a psychological ploy to get the bad guys thinking and nervous. It works. Then Diesel beats the crap out of him.The road to the money gets rockier as time goes on, resulting in a good action climax.The movie isn't flawless, but some of the acting definately was. Not a bad actor in the bunch, good action, decent plot. Well worth owning.",Knockaround Guys

Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues.Aside from that, the setting, the plot, and the costumes are pretty good!The film combines drama, action, and adventure making it rather enjoyable, as long as you're in that kind of a mood.In short, it is a movie worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History and all things Roman, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it.",N/A

894993,"Down through the years, I've seen Agatha Christie's Miss Marple played by various actresses from Helen Hayes, Angela Lansbury, Margaret Rutherford to Joan Hickson.  In all honesty, I've enjoyed them all.  I loved Margaret Rutherford and her hilarious interpretation (although Christie has been quoted as saying that Rutherford was nothing like her idea of Miss Marple) and I adored Joan Hickson (I truly feel she was closest to Agatha's idea of the character).  Now comes Geraldine McEwan (one of my favorite actresses) doing savvy Miss. Marple proud playing her with a little more spunk than the others did.  I love it!  What sparkle she exhibits!  Watch her eyes-they gleam.  I really enjoyed this new interpretation of these stories and failed to see any offensive homosexual displays.  The series is done with the optimum of good taste.  Everyone involved is splendid.  Each episode has a great cast with some of the UK's best actors on display!  Each episode has great direction and camera work.So if you love the Miss Marple mysteries, you'll enjoy this edition.","Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 1"
184476,"I'm not any kind of knowledgeable about surrealism or symbolism or anything like that- I like imagery, and I don't care if it means anything. In this film, I got what I was looking for, but I also got a lot that I could have done without. The film is done entirely in a stark, glaring black and white, so that often you can't tell what exactly is happening, but often I don't think you're supposed to. There are some truly disturbing, morbid and bloody scenes, notably the opener with ""God Killing Himself"" and the torture and murder of Earth Mother and the Son of Earth. There were scenes that I didn't understand but which still affected me deeply- the twitching and convulsing of the Son of Earth, as though he were in constant agony even when nothing was being done to him, the lurching and shambling druid-creatures and mummers and their odd rituals of feeding the earth.Unfortunately there were also endless scenes that bored me so that I nearly fast-forwarded through them (I didn't, though). There's only so long you can watch a bunch of druids dragging a twitching body across the rocky ground before you wonder where they're going with it already. I was also annoyed at the way Mother Earth seemed not to mind at all that her son was being murdered until they started beating up on her as well. She always seemed really removed from the whole thing.It was extremely compelling, even in the most drawn-out moments. I'm not sure if I ""liked"" this movie yet. I do know that I was very creeped out afterward and needed to watch something dumb and funny if I wanted to be able to sleep that night.",N/A

882800,"First impressions should not always be taken as par for the course.  That&#8217;s the lesson I&#8217;ve learned after my second viewing of this Korean film.  While impressed at the technical wizardry of director Ji-woon Kim, his film still left me with a sour taste in my mouth after the initial viewing.  &#8220;A tale of two sisters&#8221; is one of those films that has a major twist in the plot that makes you rethink the entire events you&#8217;ve previously seen.  If done right this technique can be a clever move, however it seems to have been done to death in the thrillers of the past 5 years or so. As soon as the credits rolled a strange combination of feeling dumb and disappointed hit me and I felt like I&#8217;d missed the whole point of the movie.  But although dismayed once the credit rolled I still could not get this film out of my head.  The very next day I decided to give it another viewing and I&#8217;m glad I did.  All of a sudden, key pieces of dialogue revealed themselves to be much more important than previously thought and actions that were once confusing suddenly made a lot more sense.  This is a film that commands a second viewing to be fully appreciated.  Trust me on this one.Sisters Su-mi (the older and strong-willed sister) and Su-yeon (the younger and more timid one) return to their father&#8217;s home, a large rural and gothic house, after being away at the hospital due to extended and unspecified illnesses.  Almost immediately after arriving, their shallow, condescending stepmother is on their case accusing and criticizing them for an assortment of things like not cleaning their rooms, being messy, supposedly being rude, etc.  Relationships between the three of them deteriorate to the point where the two sisters begin to suffer not only verbal but physical abuse, all while the stepfather looks on passively.  Just when tensions begin to reach a boiling point, the stepfather reveals a shocking plot point that turns the entire story on its head and makes us rethink the entire movie we&#8217;re watching.Technically, this film is highly accomplished, more than just about any of the other high-profile horror movies to come out of Asia in recent years.  From the complex plot, to the perfect casting and gorgeous cinematography every aspect of this film is a wonder to behold.  Its ability to creep out the viewer is inspiring: it has a control over light and shadow that is amazing.  Even what happens during the day is spooky, as the film has a beautiful portrait to it, a mix of flashy colors and shadows that lends it a surrealistic feel.  The house where the entirety of the movie occurs is a truly creepy place where secrets and dangers seem to lurk behind every door.  Several sequences such as the ghostly appearances in the girls&#8217; rooms and under the sink, as well as the dinner with relatives are the ultimate in creepiness.Another thing I enjoyed immensely was the chemistry between the two sisters.  Obviously the two love each other, are very close and understand each other perfectly.  The big sister is always taking care of the little one, the little one always looking to the big sister for guidance.  Their strong relationship adds so much to the power of the movie and its eeriness because you feel that something will soon crash down and shatter their little world into pieces.  A few of the scenes however were kind of derivative of other Asian fright films such as the woman crawling in the bedroom scene which reminded me suspiciously of the one in Ju-on: the Grudge.  Also, the whole idea that some characters might be ghosts is similar to recent thrillers such as &#8220;The Others&#8221; and &#8220;The Sixth Sense&#8221;.  But unlike these two films, &#8220;A tale of two sisters&#8221; stands much better to numerous repeat viewings because the twist is not at the heart of everything.  Beautiful and tragic, this one&#8217;s a must if you love Asian ghost chillers.",N/A
696499,"Well you have to like it that next gen finally broke down and used Spock, but my only problem is they kind of made him out to be this peaceful idiot. A little more wisdom from Spock would have been nice and more scenes with him and Data would have been nice but for the most part a good episode arc.My highlights for the season go against what I usually like from Trek. My favorite show was actually Inner Light where Picard lives an alternate life that really takes place over a 30 minute period where he is knocked unconscious. It finally gave me a little insight into Picard and made him human where none of the other seasons had done that for me.The season as a whole was decent. Highlights were adding a protagonist like Ensign Ro aboard the Enterprise. Most of the time I liked this addition to the crew, but periodically it was ridiculous, like her advice to ""Captain"" Troi on the episode Disaster. I also greatly enjoyed Conundrum where characters don't realize who they are and Warf thinks he is the captain.Lowlights for me have to be one of the most overhyped terrible episodes in Trek lore and thats Darmok. What a load of babble this show was. I actually fell asleep watching it because of how amazingly boring it was.The season ender was decent but I was having trouble figuring out if they were going for humor, drama, or what with the plot. The use of Mark Twain, though ridiculous was fine with me. I thought the throw away comment by Twain when he reaches the Enterprise-have you ever seen Halleys Comet was humorous though.

857621,"This is one of Carlos Kleiber's last concerts, filmed live in 1996 in the Herkulesalle, in Munich.  Kleiber looks more elderly and frail (he was just 66) than he did in the 1983 Beethoven Symphonies 4,7 with the Concertgebouw Orchestra (Philips DVD), or the 1991 Brahms Symphony 2 (Philips DVD) also in late 2004.  There is a special sense of occasion here:the orchestra and audience clearly love Kleiber, the orchestra playing with a special spirit and elan for him.Beethoven's CORIOLAN Overture is very dramatic and tragic, creating a powerful effect.  Mozart's 33rd Symphony, one less often played than the later Symphonies 35, 36, 38-41, is done lovingly, yet without the slower tempo for I used by some conductors such as Bohm (DG CD, with complete Mozart Symphonies) or Wordsworth (Naxos CD).  The Brahms Symphony 4 is beautifully played, although some might find the Passacaglia IV a bit poker faced nearing the end: not dramatic or emotional enough in the final bars.  Kleiber seems to rush through a few passages other conductors, such as Steinberg (MCA CD) lingered over.  But this is a great concert, and I would be thrilled to hear it in person.The picture is excellent, widescreen.  Camera work is terrific, and always serves the music: never invasive or distracting.  Watching this makes me regret there will be no future videos or CDs from Carlos Kleiber, and I'm a bigger fan of Bohm, Furtwangler, Bernstein, and Ormandy.  This is a great DVD: anyone liking Classical music videos will be pleased.",N/A
854098,"What is Yimou Zhang's fixation with mixing martial arts with the tragic love story?  I guess it doesn't really matter, since this time he seems to have pulled it off pretty well.  ""Hero"" does what ""House of Flying Daggers"" tried but failed to do with any credibility -- to tell a poignant tale of passionate romance within the context of the classic Chinese martial arts film.Jet Li plays ""Nameless"", ostensibly the hero who saved the emperor of Qin from the deadly trio of assassins, Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow (the latter two being lovers).  Nameless is brought before the emperor, bearing the weapons of the three assassins as proof that he vanquished them, to be rewarded for his feat.  The emperor lavishes great honors on Nameless, and questions him about how he was able to defeat such powerful enemies.  As Nameless tells his tale, the storyline is played out as a series of flashbacks depicting each encounter.The emperor, however, is suspicious of Nameless, thinking him to be a crafty assassin himself and in league with the other three, using these concocted events as a way to get close to the emperor.  The emperor offers his own account of what he thinks really happened, and the story is retold to a different conclusion, again through a series of flashbacks.  Nameless notes that parts of the emperor's rendition are correct, but others are not, and tells a third and final version of the tale.  This leads to a surprising denouement, where the relationship of Broken Sword and Falling Snow is brought to a tragic climax.  The two disagree vehemently on whether the greater good would be served by killing the tyrannical emperor, as opposed to letting this strong ruler unite all the nations of China under one banner and thus end the wars that have raged for generations.  Broken Sword's ideal of ""our land"" and the good of the nation overrides his desire to kill the emperor, provoking a deadly challenge by Snow, with unexpected and unintended results.  In my opinion it is this element of the story that lends a great air of nobility to the movie as a whole, and redeems what might otherwise be just another high-tech martial arts movie.The rest of the film was relatively well done.  I thought the initial fight sequences involving Sky were great, but from there on the director relied way too much on the use of wires and special effects.  The remaining action scenes were a visual feast but lacked any real credibility, especially the fight at the lake, where Nameless and Broken Sword demonstrated an uncanny ability to walk on water.  The director's use of color was overwhelming and unmistakeable -- and at times overdone.  In general, though, the effect was positive and lent itself to a visually beautiful, if somewhat overly artsy, presentation.  If I were to compare ""Hero"" with ""Crouching Tiger"" and ""Flying Daggers"", I would definitely say this one is the best movie of the three.",N/A

641864,"There is a reason why Edward R. Murrow is so revered by journalists the world over.In ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", George Clooney explores perhaps the most politically volatile period in the newsman's career. In the early 50s, Murrow (David Strathairn, in a great performance) went after Senator Joe McCarthy, devoting a number of his broadcasts to exposing the activities of the ""Junior Senator from Wisconsin"", the man behind HUAC, the House Un-American Activities Committee.If you know anything about this period in history, it is probably that a number of people in the entertainment community were called to testify before the committee. If they testified, they continued to work. If they didn't, they were blacklisted. Many of the biggest stars didn't testify and continued to work; if the studios blacklisted them, their revenues would have dropped. The period of the ""Blacklist"" is perhaps one of the most reprehensible periods in the history of our country.What many probably don't realize is that McCarthy started with regular people. Initially, he went after people like a middle-aged black woman who worked in the codes department of the FBI. She worked for a number of decades in the dining room of the large government agency, then received a promotion. Because there may have been a vague link to a ""communist"" publication many years earlier, she was brought before the committee and lost her job. Another of McCarthy's early targets was Milo Radulovich, a Greek-American who joined the Air Force. McCarthy learned that his father and sister may have been communist supporters and insisted that Radulovich denounce them. When he wouldn't, he was kicked out of the Air Force. The film also reminds us that people like McCarthy viewed the ACLU as a communist organization.Murrow and his producer, Fred Friendly (Clooney), decide to report the story of Milo Radulovich during one of their broadcasts. Naturally, the government is none too pleased, concerned about the security of the Air Force. McCarthy later takes them up on their offer to address the topic. Using his opportunity on Murrow's broadcast, McCarthy denounces the newsman's accusations. Sound familiar?If for no other reason, ""Goodnight"" should make you mad because we are watching a JOURNALIST at work. Murrow used his broadcasts to report issues and explore them, in depth, for 30 minutes. What a difference from the claptrap we experience today as ""television news"". The local news programs spend more time running stories about cute pets (from other cities) and trying to fit world issues and crises into a sixty second window than actually reporting the news. How can anyone learn all of the complexities of any national or world issue in 60 seconds? This is one of the reasons I listen to NPR on a daily basis. ""Goodnight"" is a portrait of a man at the height of his powers, trying to inform the public about a terrible wrong.Murrow, Friendly and their team broadcast an interview with Radulovich and then broadcast the HUAC Committee hearings about the woman who worked in the code office. Both events draw the ire of the government and McCarthy, costing Murrow his sponsor. Murrow and Friendly agree to pay for the commercials that won't air because they believe in the story so much. Bill Paley (Frank Langella), the head of CBS, supports them, to an extent, giving them the leeway to run the stories they want to run, as long as they are accurate. But when the sponsors start to pull the ads, Paley became more watchful of the newsman. Paley uses this as leverage to get Murrow to interview a series of celebrities, in exchange for giving him the go ahead to run the more hard hitting stories. Even then, the networks realized the economics of fluff. It is interesting to watch Murrow interview Liberace, from his home, about his marriage plans. Liberace states that he is going to wait for the ""right partner"" to come along before taking the plunge.David Strathairn does a great job of portraying Morrow. What I think makes the performance so indelible is that every time we see Morrow, we see the fear he is living with; the fear that McCarthy will continue with his witch-hunt and how it might change America, the fear that his voice will be silenced by a network that needs revenue to stay afloat, the fear that the public will not want to hear his voice. Strathairn portrays Murrow as a strong man, the head of a gang of reporters who are devoted to him, and he must remain strong in their presence. Yet, the fear comes through making his character seem all the more real.Clooney does a good job as Friendly, Murrow's devoted producer. It is a smaller role and provides less impact than Strathairn's performance, but it does provide a great amount of insight into the support team behind Murrow.Langella is also very good as Paley. For his few moments of screen time, he manages to portray the complexity of a man with morals running a large broadcast network. He wants to support Murrow, but he also has hundreds of employees to think of. Any decision he makes will affect the lives of all of those people.Clooney, the director, is less interested in making all of the other people in the team stand out. It is difficult to tell who the other people are, or what their function in the team is. Robert Downey, Jr., Tate Donovan, Reed Diamond and Patricia Clarkson are members of Murrow's team, yet we only get a vague idea of who they are and what they do. Downey, Jr. and Clarkson are married, yet hiding the marriage from the rest of the team. I must have missed the reason behind this. For any other film, this would be a more compelling criticism. In the case of ""Goodnight"", the film is, ostensibly, about Murrow and therefore should focus on him. It seems less important that the other characters are mere shadows. Clearly, the talent involved wanted to help bring this story to life and didn't care about the size of the role.Clooney does a fantastic job of recreating the time and space of the CBS Network offices in the early 50s. The film, shot in black and white, has a slightly grainy look, coupled with the constant cigarette smoke swirling throughout the air, gives everything the look of an old television newscast. All of the sets are drenched in shades of black and white, further adding to the period feel. The look really reminded me of one of Woody Allen's good black and white films, like ""Broadway Danny Rose"".

875428,"Along with the Paul Winfield movie on MLK (which the late Winflield does for Dr. King what Denzel did for Malcolm X), this is clearly the best documentary of MLK that is avaialble on DVD.Basically, it does not do much on his early years and skims the all-too familiar story of the Momtgomery bus boycott. But it deals with a lot of lesser known matters of his career from 1963 to his assassination in 1968.The ""Children's Crusade"" of Birmingham in 1963 is handled from all angles, as well as the events leading up to the March on Washington and the all-too familiar Dream Speech. We learn a lot more about lesser-known matters such as the issues surrounding his receiving the Nobel Prize, the Selma and Chicago campaigns (one important error here is that Dr. King himself never actually marched in the antiblack community of Cicero, Ill. in 1966, Dr. King marched in the equally racist Gage Park, but other independent marchers went to the notorious Cicero). And we also look into his campaigns against the Vietnam War and poverty in America, which usually get short shrift when Dr. King is taught to American schoolchildren, and the issues leading to his assassination.This documentary is even more blatant than the Winfield movie in pointing out Dr. King's flaws (womanizing, poor health habits, questionable associations, etc) but it is a balanced portrait in showing the good that Dr. King attempted to accomplish during this time without compromising on his Ghandian philosophy.One particularly intriguing segment shows Dan Rather, who now prides himself on his professed sympathy for the movement, annoying Dr. King with questions about Communist associations (c. 1963). Mike Wallace is also shown disturbing Dr. King (around 1966) about whether he is making white people tired with his demonstrations. Dr. King's anger in both cases is controlled, but apparent.But overall, the King novice as well as history fans, high school, and college students will do well to watch this in conjunction with the Paul Winfield film. Both will show the historical layman that Dr. King was about far more than dreaming dreams and making pretty speeches.",N/A
686657,"This movie is alright. I suggest any big fan of jet li go see it. I am just gonna talk about the dvd aspects of the special edition dvd.IMAGE:Colmbia TriStar present the picture in both a 2:17:1 ratio anamorphic widescreen and a full screen format. The widescreen obviously better duplicates the film's original theatrical showing, but the fullscreen often displays more image at the stop and bottom. Because of the short running time of the feature the two choices can be accommodated one the same side of a dual-layered disc. The picture quality is good when the director isn't playing overmuch with filters and lens. It's a little rough and dark at times, but there are no significant moire effects or grain to worry about. I just wish it were more interesting to look at instead of having to stare at all those dull, tiresome, iron-gray tones.SOUND:The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, which I had admired in Jet Li's previous films, is here merely loud. There is no subtlety, no grace about it anywhere. It's mainly used to underscore every plot action with a pounding. glaring rock beat, whether the scene needs it or not. Occasionally, a bullet will whiz by in a rear speaker or a car will screech around a corner behind us. It seems hardly worth the effort.EXTRAS:As far as special features go, Columbua have produced enough of them to take one's mind off the movie for a while. Like rather than watching the film, you could listen to the audio commentary with director James Wong and various filmmakers with the telivision screen turned off. You could also watch one of four featurettes: ""Jet Li is the One,"" thirteen minutes long, an extended promo with interviews of cast and vrew. ""Multiverse Creates the One,"" eighteen minutes long, detailing the action sewuences, ""About Face,"" six minutes long, examining how the graphic artists enabled Li to fight himself in the finale, and ""The Many Faces of Jet li."" two minutes, another actor promo.

So, I cannot take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that is not familiar with the ""details"" I have to say that the movie was pretty good!It is an action-packed Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider type of adventure combining significant elements of horror.The acting is average and the choice for lead actress was poor at best. Though she is a Halle Berry type (which is definitely a bonus) this film does not seem to be her thing, especially when she does not present her ""Halle Berry qualities."" Consequently she is not convincing in her role.  Moreover, the opening scenes with her receiving the phone call while climbing the mountain were weak.Nevertheless, the setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all very good!In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!",AVP: Alien vs. Predator

It is bad enough that the pace of this movie is slow but when you add Chachi from Happy Days to play a small role here, you know where this is headed. Who wrote the dialogue for Curse anyways. If this is your day job, quit man. It is just a typical run in the mill howlers for all you wolf masters out there.

846742,"So, now we're introduced to the epic world of Riddick's universe (underverse).  I think it's a little strange now that the titles of the three movies in order go like this:  The Chronicles of Riddick:  Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury, and The Chronicles of Riddick.  Anyway, I feel that Keith David's talent and character were completely wasted in this film.  It just seems like something Paul Anderson would do (not giving anything away).  Another thing is the fact that this universe is SOOOO different from the more dirty/realistic atmosphere of the first movie, and even Dark Fury really can't explain this.  Another thing is that there's no talk of superhuman armies taking over galaxies in Pitch Black, you'd think something like that would be big news but it just sort of jumps out at us in this film.  It just feels a little too epic compared to the first movie.  Anyway, the action and special effects completely make up for this.  One thing I don't understand is why Universal releases 2 seperate versions of the films.  Theatrical and Director's Cut.  That's really dumb IMO.  Well, when the 3rd Riddick movie comes out there'll be a box set, and that's when I'll get the DVD's.",N/A

Pacino is just incrediable in this movie and his pairing with Ellen Barkin is perfect. They definitely go on that list of dynamic on-screen couples. I also enjoyed Pacino and Goodman as partners, but than again I find that Al Pacino is one of those actors that seems to bring out the best in whomever he's working with.

805993,"After the first 90 minutes, I was about to stop watching and save this six hour HBO miniseries for another rainy day. When Meryl Streep arrives in New York City from her Mormon homeland, to visit her son and question his strange behavior, the film improves considerably. She brings a much needed point of view to what has already been established as an ensemble of unlikeable characters threatened by the AIDS virus during the epidemic's early stages of development.  Not that Streep's character doesn't tow her own worldly baggage, but her ordinary yet not unquestioning life contrasts well with the troubled complications of the other characters. She's like a sigh of relief when all else is bated breath. Somewhere deeply involved in the second half, I had to ask myself if I'm enjoying the film because of the creativity involved or is this merely a good soap opera? And were the surreal scenes of a frustrated wife stepping into La-La Land, angels crashing through hospital ceilings, and the ghost of U.S. assasinated convicted spy Ethel Rosenberg walking around and offering advice, effective or merely indulgent? There's also a strange morality working here; a perceived as evil AIDS patient succumbs to the illness, while a good-hearted one survives; out and proud homosexuals are made heroic while a troubled one, guilted by his religious upbringing, is left out in the cold. An enthralling film with powerhouse characterizations, it finally doesn't all add up but it marches by proudly like lesser and greater parts of a passing parade. I couldn't help but be impressed with the overall spectacle.",Angels in America
756417,"I love Vincent Price and Peter Lorre, not to mention Poe, so I was certainly looking forward to watching these.The first movie is The Comedy of Terrors and it really is quite funny.  Since you've read the plot a million times on these reviews, I'll cut to the chase.  Vincent Price and Peter Lorre try to drum up more business for a funeral home through murder, hence more customers.Vincent Price is laugh out loud funny, and really does have a talent for comedy, as does Peter Lorre.  The facial expressions of Price are fantastic, as they were in Tales of Terror and it's an enjoyable film to watch.  Watch for the actress called ""Beverly Hills"" in this one.  (You'll recognize her by her, uh, name.)  On a last note with this movie, Joyce Jameson, sexy as always, plays the wife of Vincent Price in this, and it's just so nice to watch a film where you know that all the women involved have natural figures from the waist up.  No guessing here.  This era has passed.The second film was pretty good, which is The Raven.  Based on Poe's poem, The Raven, is named as a ""comedy"" and has its moments, but I enjoyed it more as a fun drama than a straight ahead gag reel.  Price and Lorre are good as always and Jack Nicholson even pops up here as the son of Peter Lorre, which is odd enough.  The movie is basically about a couple of powerful wizards (Price and Boris Karloff) who end up fighting each other for supremecy.  A big budget film this is not, which is funny, considering that Corman says in one of the special features that this is one of the highest budget films in the Poe line.  The ending battle between Price and Karloff is hysterically bad (in a good way).  It is so utterly cheesy, you just have to laugh.  I believe a Godzilla sound effect even makes itself known somewhere in the sequence.Both of these movies are brilliant....brilliantly bizarre, especially Comedy of Terrors.You really have to have a certain type of black humor to enjoy these, which I do, so it worked out well.  I would recommend buying this.  Also, the transfers are very good, in widescreen, anamorphic format, which is cool.",N/A
807591,"I saw this wrestlemania last year at a friend's house on pay-per-view. When it came out on dvd, I immediately bought it, Being that i wanted to own this show so bad. This show was quite good and the only reason i don't give it that 5th star is because of the extreme dissapointment that came with the Goldberg-Lesnar match. Anyway, Here's my opinions on all the matches of this card:1. For the WWE U.S. titleChampion The big show vs. John cenaThis was a bad way to start the show. The match was boring and the moves weren't really that impressive at all. Skip this match. As interesting as Cena's raps are, It's just too bad that he isn't that good of a wrestler. In fact, I'm still waiting to see a match from Cena that's better than his debut wwe match he had against kurt angle on an episode of smackdown back in 2002. Cena wins the u.s. title from the big show. It's amazing that at the very next wrestlemania, Which took place this year, John Cena would become the wwe champion. *1/22. Fatal 4 way match for the WWE world tag team titlesChampions Booker T & Rob Van Dam Vs. The Dudley Boyz Vs. La Resistance Vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison CadeThis match was ok. This match did feature some great action from RVD and it is an improvement over the opening match. It's watchable. Booker & RVD retain the tag titles in this one. ***1/23. Chris Jericho Vs. ChristianOh man! Why was this great match put on so early? This match was filled with excitement and great action. Both Jericho and Christian did an awesome job with this match and this is certainly one of the best matches on this show. Christian wins in a very shocking way. *****4. 3 on 2 handicap matchThe Rock n sock Connection vs. Evolution [Randy Orton, Ric Flair, & Batista]The Rock and Mick Foley reunited their tag team to take on evolution last year. Well, This match was alright. At least i was able to make it through this match without falling asleep and i take that into consideration a lot. Evolution won when Randy Orton pinned Mick Foley following an RKO. Batista would go on to become the world champion at this year's wrestlemania. Randy Orton became the world champion just months later at last year's summerslam when he defeated Chris Benoit, Who would win the world title later on in the main event of this show. ***5. Playboy Evening Gown matchSable & Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Kiebler & Miss JackieIf you seen one evening gown match, You've seen them all. Skip. Sable & Torrie won, But i don't think nobody really cared. No stars6. Cruiserweight Open Invitational matchChampion Chavo Guerrero Vs. Billy Kidman Vs. Rey Mysterio Vs. Ultimo Dragon Vs. Nunzio Vs. Shannon Moore Vs. Tajiri Vs. Jamie Knoble Vs. Akio Vs. FunakiNow this is what i'm talking about! This match was very exciting and it had many great impressive high flying moves to really catch a wrestling fan's attention. These 9 cruiserweights really did a great job with this match. Full of great fast-paced high flying action, This match is a definite highlight of this wrestlemania. Chavo retains the title with help from his father, Chavo sr. I would've liked it even more if Mysterio Or Kidman or Tajiri won this match, But oh well, This match is already excellent as it is! *****7. Goldberg Vs. Brock LesnarSpecial Referee: Stone Cold Steve AustinThis was 1 of the matches i looked forward to seeing at this wrestlemania. Unfortunately, This match really failed to live up to its hype. The match went far too slow and let's face it, There was absolutely no reason for these 2 guys to stay in a tie up for over 4 minutes!!! There was very limited action in this match and if you haven't seen this match but wanna see this match, Don't bother. Trust me, This match is nowhere near as good as you probably are expecting it to be. 2nd worst match on this event. Only reason this even gets a star is because it's better than that stupid evening gown match that took place earlier. Other than that, A big waste of time. Unfortunately, This was the last night that either of these guys appeared in the WWE. What a dissapointing end to both of these guys wrestling careers. Goldberg won. *8. Fatal 4 way match for the WWE world tag team titlesChampions Scotty 2 hotty & Rikishi Vs. The Acolytes Vs. Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas vs. The basham brothersThis match was decent. It wasn't as good as raw's fatal 4 way tag match, But hey, It was WAY better than that last match before it. Scotty & Rikishi retain the tag titles in this match. 1 thing that is unbelievable is that Bradshaw would win the wwe world title just a few months later after this match. **1/29. For the WWE women's titleChampion Victoria Vs. Molly HollyThis match was watchable to say the least. It's better than most women's matches that take place in the WWE today and to be able to say that, That's enough for me to give this match an average rating. Victoria retains the belt and as a stipulation, Molly's Hair gets shaved. **1/210. For the WWE world titleChampion Eddie Guerrero Vs. Kurt AngleThis was a great match! Two of the best wrestlers in the WWE today put on an awesome match. The action was very impressive, It was fast-paced, The wrestling was very unpredictable, And the match was never boring. These 2 always put on a good show when they're in the ring against each other. If you're a fan of either of these guys, You should most definitely watch this match. I guarantee you will love it. Even has an awesome ending courtesy of Guerrero. Guerrero retains the title. ***** [Best match on the event]11. The Undertaker Vs. KaneThis match wasn't really that good. It was too one-sided and it was a little too short. I was only able to get through this match with ease because it was the return of The Undertaker, Who's 1 of my all-time favorites. **1/212. Triple Threat Match for the World TitleChampion Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Chris BenoitThis was a great main event. The wrestling was good, The match wasn't no longer than what it needed to be, And something that was long overdue finally happened at the end of this match. This match was very entertaining and all 3 of the wrestlers in this match gave it their all. This match never got boring and the more it went on, The more i anticipated its ending. To my [And hopefully, Many fans] Delight, Benoit forced Triple H to tap out to the crossface and he finally became the world title. You can really tell that Benoit truly wanted that belt, Being that he even went as far as to cry at the end of this match. And it was quite an emotional moment when Benoit And Guerrero hugged each other and cryed together as the world champions of the WWE. It's a shame that they had to lose their belts to Randy Orton and Bradshaw. These 2 guys should have, In my opinion, spent the rest of last year as champions. An awesome main event and a great way to end this show. *****All in all, This was a good wrestlemania. Right about now, This wrestlemania and all the other wrestlemanias can be found in a box set that was just released by the WWE. You have 2 choices, You can buy the entire box set which has all of the first 21 wrestlemanias, and believe me, That box set is extremely expensive, or You can take the cheaper, Smarter way out and buy the box set by individual 5-set volumes [Which cost about $50-60 a piece]. This wrestlemania was great. WWE fans should like this wrestlemania a lot. Well, I hope my review helped. Be blessed.",N/A
553543,"Orson Welles directed ""Lady from Shanghai"" and stars as Michael O'Hara, a mysterious down-on-his-luck sailor.  As the film opens, O'Hara meets the beautiful Rosalie Bannister (Rita Hayworth) by rescuing her some street thugs; however, little is as it seems, and O'Hara finds himself quickly drawn into Rosalie's life.  Turns out that Rosalie is actually married to a powerful lawyer, Arthur Bannister.  Soon O'Hara, against his better judgment, is working on the couple's yacht and everything gets more and more complicated.""Lady from Shanghai"" is one of Hayworth's most famous starring roles, and it's easy to see why - she looks amazing and is quite good.  However, the film is disappointing.  In particular, the plot is unnecessarily convoluted: the focus seems to be on fancy camera work.  The close-ups and numerous pans certainly create an atmospheric film.  After revolutionizing movie directing six years earlier with ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles was obviously wont to continue his flashy directing here.  However, the elements don't mesh well, at the expense of character and plot development.  Film noir is always a risky proposition because of the labyrinthine plots, but one cannot rely on atmosphere alone.  Also, the film veers toward haminess at times, particularly Welles' thick Irish brogue.  The movie is, however, undeniably fascinating.  The hall of mirrors sequence is especially fun, although it's been emulated many times since.The backstory is also typical of a Welles film.  Despite being known for her long red hair, Welles had Hayworth cut her get her hair cut short and dyed platinum blonde.  The studio understandably had a fit: just one more of Welles' career battles with producers.  In this case, however, Welles did not deliver an incontestable classic with the mettle of a ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Magnificent Ambersons.""  Instead, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" is an atmospheric but somewhat bizarre film noir that stops well short of greatness; nevertheless the film is a must-see for a number of reasons.",N/A

899478,"Baptists at Our Barbeque is a movie apparently produced primarily for a Mormon audience.  By way of example, there are any number of inside jokes and references that Gentiles will probably miss entirely, a stark contrast to Garrison Keillor's Lake Woebegon where even outsiders get the jokes.  But much like Lake Woebegon, the essential plot and almost comic innocence of the characters who populate this movie make it broadly appealing.The story is simple enough: an unmarried, 29 year-old Mormon forest ranger decides to accept a transfer to the oddball town of Longfellow to escape the efforts of his mother (and the efforts of the mothers of every unmarried girl in Provo) to get him hitched.  But Longfellow is no ordinary town.  Tucked away somewhere in the beautiful Rockies, it is a community precisely divided between Baptists and Mormons.  This balance, and the competition is engenders, essentially fuels the movie.  Yes, there are the colorful and eccentric characters we have come to expect from small town settings ever since Andy Griffith introduced us to Barney, Floyd and the rest of the off-kilter residents of Mayberry; and there is the central love story between ""Tartan,"" the main character, and the incredibly beautiful ""Charity,"" played by Heather Beers. There is even an antagonist, the pathetic ""Rich"" who provides the movie's small amount of tension and danger.What unfolds is general silliness wrapped around a deeper story of the Baptist and Mormon communities coming together.  Recalling the original Star Trek episode, ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,"" starring Frank Gorshin, the essential point of this movie is that while the Mormons and Baptists of Longfellow may see each other as starkly ""different,"" to the eyes of outsiders they are in fact all but identical.  Where skin-deep differences in ""Let That Be...."" led to tragedy, however, the characters in Barbeque eventually come to see that the differences are unimportant.Neither the script nor the essential story call for great acting, and the cast does a more than decent job engaging us in the respective quirks of their characters.  If there are faults to be found in this movie a central one is that in an effort to depict the characters as completely wholesome, even essential human emotions are bleached out of existence.  While the addition of graphic sex would NOT have improved the story one iota, the main character's lack of response when his house is torched by the local miscreant strikes a dissonant chord and somehow loses him the sympathy the audience has built for him.  A second point is that the movie is essentially told entirely from the Mormon's perspective.  While the script certainly is not heavy on theology, the lack of Baptist perspective leaves that group looking simply like bigots.  Finally, one wonders what the story would have been like if it had featured Catholics and Lutherans.  But that particular minefield has long been staked out by Keillor and these are small quibbles.  Maybe there really are towns like this somewhere where people just naturally and repeatedly turn the other cheek  Would that it were so...we could all learn a lesson from such tolerance.",Baptist At Our Barbecue

580185,"""When It Was A Game"" was a labor of love, and when it was first televised on HBO the eyes of baseball fans were riveted and amazed.  All 3 of these projects consist of ""home movies"" (usually shot in 8 mm), often shot by the players themselves.  But almost all of these films are in vivid color - and to see the names that haunt Cooperstown in lifelike tones is an almost religious experience.  It would be similar if it were possible to see color footage from the Civil War or the Constitutional Convention.  Okay - I'm stretching it a little, but not by much.  Baseball fans have always had a little historian in them, and although you'd be hard-pressed to find, for example, the sports fanatic who could tell you how many touchdown passes Unitas threw or how many points Wilt Chamberlain wound up with, even casual baseball fans knew numbers like 61 (the number of Home Runs Roger Maris hit in 1961), 56 (the number of consecutive games Joe DiMaggio hit safely in during the summer of 1941), 714 (Babe Ruth's lifetime home run total) and zero (the number of Brooklyn Dodgers who got on base during Don Larsen's perfect game of 1956.)  If you took only the ""named events"" of the New York Giants at the famed Polo Grounds you could start with ""the shot heard 'round the world"" (Bobby Thompson's home run off Ralph Branca winning the 1951 National League pennant) and ""the catch"" (Willie Mays' amazing over-the-shoulder catch of Vic Wertz' 475 foot drive to deep center field, saving the game and inspiring the Giants to win the 1954 World Series.)For fans who like their baseball heroic, ""When It Was A Game"" brings their heroes to full-color life.Appropriate music and reverent narration add to the historic but vibrant qualities of the works.  ""When It Was A Game"" was eye-catching when it debuted, and so popular that it spawned a sequel that was more or less more of the same.  The third volume may be the most interesting of all (especially if you're old enough to remember watching baseball from the 1960s on), but it also adds the historical context that the innovative National League completely dominated the old boy network of the American League because of their willingness to sign Black players like Willie Mays and Hank Aaron and Latinos like Roberto Clemente.  The NL won 19 out of 20 All-Star Games starting in 1962, and this little documentary doesn't mind saying that it was the narrow-mindedness of the American League that allowed Morgan, Stargell, Banks, Gibson, Marichal and McCovey to join Mays, Clemente and Aaron on teams that regularly trounced the other, whiter, league.Like Ken Burns' ""Baseball"", this set is a video love-song to baseball.",N/A
893040,"Shakespeare's lines will carry any movie above the waterline, and the same can be said of Pacino's acting. They both make this movie presentable and even excellent at times. However, the angle of the movie seems to be one of contradiction to the text, beginning with the introductory text prior to the film's dialogue (text from the Director NOT Shakespeare). This text attempts to excuse the very play itself for its characterization of Christians and the Jew, Shylock. If the play needed an intro, Shakespeare would have written a prologue. It certainly works to bias the audience in a way. The other attempt to do this is several scenes where the ""Christian"" characters are carousing in a bawdy house with a bunch of half-naked prostitutes. Clearly, the director attempts to make a martyr of Shylock and hypocrites of all the non-Jew characters: however Shakespeare's text is what it is. The nudity is utterly unnecessary and detracts from the integrity of the play--plus it cannot now be shown to young people.Other than those detractions, I think the film is excellent. The trial scene is superb and brings the tension of the moment to life. Besides Pacino the other actors do a fine job. Unfortunately, though I am a lover of Shakespeare, I would not want to watch this again.Author of ""Shakespeare on Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays""",William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice

Cillian Murphey is the perfect villian(proven with his role as the ONLY good thing in Batman) gorgeous and sinister as he plays his role with icy yet edgy preciseness. I'm glad that he saw through all of her plans - it made it more realistic.When she first started kicking butt, I was a little bit worried we'd get Tomb Raider feministic fop action, but she maintained her shaky terror fairly well. Also, the fact that she'd been attacked before gave her reason to be prepared and have the ability to execute some clear thinking and action amidst such trauma(her previous attack also explains her jittery relations with Cillian in the airport before she knows who he is).The two things I might have altered: 1) That Cillian didn't get a little more depth of character. There were a couple moments where you saw him swallow hard or look at Rachel a tidge differently, but mostly he was pure evil. A little bit of subtle struggling with his mission would have given the film a little more edge and Cillian could have more than handled it. 2) The cop-out ""hollywood ending"" scene. Urgh. They kept it so real up to the last scene where McAdams DID succumb to putting on the tough girl pants and going back to work MINUTES AFTER HER LIFE HAD BEEN BRUTALLY THREATENED to deliver some sassy lines to cranky customers.But I can forgive for a movie that delivered very solid acting, very creative filming, very intense action, and very edge-of-your-seat-grab-your-boyfriend-scream-in-the-theatre scares.Red Eye is worth seeing, and is probably even worth seeing in theatres if you get the chance.",N/A

165411,"This is probably my favorite Tom Cruise film. I love that even though Cruise is undoubtedly the star of the movie (the title of the movie?!?), the greatness of the film didn't depend on his star power. The movie got a great supporting cast from Renee Zellweger to Cuba Gooding Jr., the movie's got a great screenplay (""Show me the money!!!"" ""You complete me""... ""You had me at hello"") that is amusing and funny and perceptive and intelligent without being pushy. I love that the characters are eloquent but knows its boundaries and know that a simple glance or close up or smirk says it all. In short the screenplay knows when to talk and when to shut up!I also love the music used in the movie, I swear every time I hear ""Free Falling"" I can just picture Tom Cruise singing his lungs out or the Secret Garden by Springsteen, which is another song that I associate with the movie And of course there are the great performances by the entire cast. Cruise did a great job playing the character, it's fun seeing him play a loser for a change. This is one of his best performances. Renee Zellweger in her breakthrough role was radiant. Even though there's no doubt she's grown as an actress (from Chicago to Cold Mountain), I miss the understated, quiet effervescence and just vulnerability she showed in this movie (also in One True Thing). Cuba Gooding Jr the scene stealer himself, was just great. I especially like the scenes where he's making fun of Jerry. All of those things were used by Cameron Crowe to create this wonderful film.In the DVD, there's a great extra, a video commentary. It's the normal commentary that we know except that there's another screen where we can see the speakers (Cruise, Zellweger, Gooding, Crowe). There's a small box at the bottom of the screen where we see the movie the way they see them. That was just innovative and very fun to watch, I wonder why others don't adopt this kind of commentary. This would especially work with ""fun"" films (Clueless, Friends!!).Grade: A",Jerry Maguire

But Brando could have been delivering lines from a Harley Davidson repair manual would it really matter? I mean can anybody understand all his mumbling anyway?

It brings you in depth personality traits of each character, even the evil Darth Vader, one of the first villians to have an actual personality.

Rocky & the Balboa family move back into the old Phillie neighborhood that they fought their out of all those years ago.Things get grim when Rocky finds out he has irreversible brain damage, meaning that one more fight could kill him.Whats even worse is a scruplous fight promoter, George Washington Duke, hounding Rocky trying to get him back into the ring, for a mighty payday no matter what the cost to Rocky's life.A small glimmer of hope for Rocky turns up in the form of Tommy Gunn, a promising young fighter who is a big fan of ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky decides to take the young fighter under his wing and train him much the same way Mickey trained him. But, as Tommy gets better & heads up to the top of the rankings, fans & the media nickname Tommy, ""Rocky's Shadow"", a nickname that Tommy doesn't take kindly to.Whats worse is that George Washington Duke is slowly moving in and steering Tommy into his direction, enticing the kid with money, cars, women, etc. Things that Rocky couldn't give the kid. Tommy signs a contract, practically ditching Rocky.But, the one thing Tommy doesn't have, & wants more than anything else, is respect and Tommy has none of it. Its up to Rocky to teach the kid a lesson & know his role.""Rocky V"" is easily the weakest link in the saga. It trys to capture the spirit of the earlier films, but, somehow doesn't quite grasp it. The problem here is in the first 2 films viewers watched Rocky as a hungry fighter going the distance, twice, and beating the odds, while, in this film it just seems like a been there, done that attitude blankets the film.It does suck to see Rocky lose it all & move back into a place that he thought he would never have to go back to.The fight at the end is o.k., at best (again, I would rate it dead last in the saga, as far as the fights go). When I first realized this was the big fight of the movie, it really was a dissapointment (no training montage?! no ""eye of the tiger""!?!)""Rocky V"" is a decent enough movie, but, I always thought the saga should've gone out with a bang, than a whimper.As for ""Rocky VI"", its highly likely that it will ever hit the big screen (""V"" was released 15 years ago). There is a script treatment that is worth checking out in Stallone's own magazine titled ""Sly"".In the script an aging Rocky realizes that nothing lasts forever. Its been roughly five years since the death of Adrian, Paulie finally gets a girlfriend and moves in with her, Rocky Jr. has grown up & become a busy businessman & for the first time in a long while Rocky is all alone. But, when the current heavyweight champ is dissed on a ESPN style cableshow, in which a daily feature has a current sportstar going up against a sportslegend of the same sport (its all CGI & computer enhanced), in this case, he went up against Rocky & lost badly, he calls Rocky out of retirement to see if he still has The Eye Of The Tiger.Not bad.

890247,"I have been putting this one off and I don't know why. I saw the Broadway production back in 2001 and I really enjoyed it. I guess due to the harsh critic reviews and the fact that I thought that most actors couldn't sing these wonderful songs kept me away until today. Let me just say that the critics are way off and I would easily put this film in the top 5 I have seen last year. The first thing that stands out in this film besides the beauty of Emmy Rossum as Christine is the lavish production & set design. There is so much detail and color everywhere that you will have to watch this film again to take it all in. The two leads are great in the acting and singing department, especially Rossum (an angel's voice to go with that beautiful face) who is the standout of the group. Gerard Butler really surprised me here and made a very complex Phantom. And I must mention Minnie Driver who was very funny as Carlotta, but didn't use her real voice. Ignore the critics and look at the 5 star rating here from people like you and me. This is the best movie musical ever in my opinion and should be seen on the big screen for the sheer spectacle of it.",N/A

Otherwise, you will not be able to appreciate this movie to the same degree.""Before Sunset,"" having the same director and actors, is an 80 minute movie in real time capturing the second meeting of this magical soul mate-destined couple played beautifully by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke.First, the bad news - the movie is very talky. I was hoping for a bit more frequent subtle action and silence, as we see as they climb the walk-up. I'm also wondering why the very end fades on one specific character when I think a more suitable ending, and prelude to a third film, would have been a shot from a distance containing them both.Other than that, I have nothing but praise for this wonderful film that engages sensitive viewers. The subject matter and acting felt so real to me, as if we weren't watching a movie at all, but, in fact, Ethan and Julie as real people in Paris.I am hoping we do not have to wait another nine years to see them again, but I'm prepared to wait if that is what it takes.",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)
306920,"This movie was made from a book by a doctor who told his own story about becoming ill and learning about the medical profession and its dehumanizing qualities by becoming a patient.  It caused quite a stir at the time and this movie was quite popular when it came out.  William Hurt plays the successful, brilliant, but cold heart surgeon, Dr. Jack MacKee.  He and his beautiful wife, Anne (played so well by Christine Lahti), live a materially comfortable but emotionally detached existence with their son, Nicky.Dr. Jack has been ignoring a raspy throat and cough until he coughs up blood.  Soon, he is diagnosed with a tumor on one of his vocal cords.  He becomes the patient of Dr. Leslie Abbott who is even colder than him, she is talented but sees only problems to fix, the person exists to her only as something to bring her the illness to cure.  The doctors in this film are largely all of the same stripe.  They are supreme problem solvers who avoid any involvement with the people they are treating.  The one exception, and an object of ridicule of the other doctors is Dr. Eli Blumfield (portrayed very nicely by Adam Arkin).As a patient, the unhuman sterility of the hospital and its policies become clear to Dr. Jack as he is treated as a container for the problem the doctors are to fix.  One of the things all patients do is wait, and then wait, and then wait some more.  While he is thus engaged in waiting helplessly for treatment he meets another patient, June Ellis (heroically played by Elizabeth Perkins).  She is dying of a grade IV glioblastoma (a type of brain tumor).  One of her complaints is that they should have found her tumor sooner.  At first, Dr. Jack does the ""team"" thing by refusing to admit that they should have and giving her false hope with a lie about a patient in a similar condition who is now a grandfather.As an aside, one of my family members died of a grade IV glioblastoma.  It doesn't matter when they diagnose the patient.  The treatments they offer are all about stalling death, not preventing it.  In nearly all cases, the patient will die within a year.  June's lack of functional deficit and lack of a surgical scar on her scalp are all dramatic license to help keep June completely sympathetic (gruesome is not sympathetic).  Her head is shaved, but radiation treatment does not leave the scalp with a neatly shaved look.  The hair falls out unevenly, and the high does of radiation often leaves the skin reddened and raw from being burned.  There is no reason to hold back on the radiation dose, since it was all a Hail Mary kind of treatment.  I hope the treatments have gotten better since 1999 and that someday real hope can be offered those afflicted with this miserable condition.  The one great lesson life offers during this time is how little is needed to find life precious.  We spend so much time putting conditions on our happiness that we cheat ourselves of so much.  This kind of illness takes away the ability to even have good days and eventually even good hours.  Good moments become wonderful and intensely full of life.  Something as simple as a chicken salad sandwich and lemon poppyseed cake with a can of Vernors can provide an exquisitely memorable moment.  The movie captures this to a degree, but not as powerfully as it can happen in real life.Anyway, June becomes the means to Dr. Jack finding his humanity and becoming a better person and doctor.  It is nice that the screenplay has Dr. Jack finding his way in a very uneven and often frustrating way.  The movie ends with a kind of dramatic gag that rewards the audience for following an often grim story all the way through.Good movie, good notes for all people - including medical professionals - to take about the importance of treating those with whom we interact on a daily basis as real people rather than as an impersonal piece of business.",The Doctor VHS
850085,"The search for family and home are universal themes to which everyone can relate. What's refreshing about ""A Home at the End of the World"" is that it explores these issues in a decidedly nontraditional way, with quirky characters that form bonds much different from the conventional suburban household, but no less loving.Written and adapted by the author of ""The Hours,"" Michael Cunningham, ""World"" centers on a romantic triangle between Bobby Morrow (Colin Farrell), his childhood friend Jonathan Glover (Dallas Roberts), and a free-spirited older woman named Clare (Robin Wright Penn).The film could have gotten caught up in its storyline, but chooses instead to focus on the complexity of the relationships between the characters. That's why it works. The characters, each played with sincerity and depth of conviction, are so compelling that the film becomes like a character study in friendship, family and love. All of the actors in the film turn in exquisite performances. But, it's Farrell's astonishing portrayal of Bobby that stands out.Similar to Charlise Theron's portrayal in ""Monster,"" though not as risky, Farrell breaks free from his stereotypical roles for this film. Nearly unrecognizable as the soft-spoken Bobby, Farrell proves he has more to offer audiences than his usual two-dimensional portrayals in films such as ""Phone Booth"" and ""S.W.A.T."" In fact, this film is all about breaking stereotypes. That is its appeal. In a way, the film uniqueness makes its common themes stand out more because it proves that family, just like people, comes in all shapes and sizes.The DVD extras include the trailer and a segment called The Journey Home, which includes interviews with the director and the actors. Farrell is surprisingly absent from the segment, but the others talk candidly about their love for the characters and the deep emotions that are expressed through the work.","HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD, A (WS) (DV"
354267,"This movie, while perhaps not authentic, is a lot of fun, period!While many ""Dumas"" purists may be upset by the liberties taken with the story, this movie has a lot of entertainment value. I also have no problem letting my kids watch this movie . There are some subtle innuendos but they never crossed the line in my opinion to the point where most kids would even have a frame of reference in which to understand them. But, to each his own, I'm more concerned about gratuitous violence in a movie than innuendos of the sort found in this film.I thought the actors and actresses did a perfectly fine job for the type of movie that it is (an entertaining light film with just enough tension in it, like that big ugly guy in the prison), in particular I thought Oliver Platt as Porthos was particularly entertaining and of course Tim Curry was excellent in his role as Cardinel Richelieu and Michael Wincott as Rochefort was an excellent secondary villain.I've watched this movie many many times already and it's one of those that we pull off the shelf from time to time to watch as a family, along with other standby's like ""The Princess Bride"",  ""Robin Hood Men In Tights"" and ""The Holy Grail"".I would also like to say that I thought those folks who recommended the earlier version of ""the Three Musketeers"" w/ Michael York, Rachel Welch etc. were also right on the money!

227807,"In many ways this is my favorite Aliens film.  It takes a couple of watchings to realize that this isn't just a clone of Alien, even if the monsters are pretty much the same.  Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley again, awakening after some fifty years of suspended animation to discover a world with which she has little connection.  Her daughter dead of old age, and the company intent on punishing her for destroying one of their ships, the embittered Ripley is left no choice but to become a dock worker in a world that has no use for pilots who have lost their licenses.The world of the alien has been terraformed and colonized.  The company's chilling decision on learning that there might be a death ship on the planet is to send in some investigators without any preparation.  The inevitable happens, and contact with the colony ceases and the worst is suspected.  Ripley is drafted by Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), a sleazy executive with few moral and a lot of greed, to act as consultant to a team of space marines that should be able to handle almost anything an alien life form can try.  Emphasis on 'should' of course.The marines find that the colonists are dead, except for one young girl - Newt Jordan (Carrie Henn), who has stayed alive by hiding from the host of aliens that now have full run of the colony.  The marines can kill the aliens, but the aliens can kill them.  And there are a lot of the slimy things.  Even worse, the creatures seem to have developed into something more than an animal and pretty soon, the humans are trapped on the planet and caught in a protracted last stand.The story itself is excellent.  The film is full of a lot of action, considerably more human interest than Alien did, and an excellent level of acting for an action film.Overwhelming special effects are avoided, but there's no lack of detailed scenes and spooky alien photos.  Even where the action is predictable it's still great fun to watch.  I found the special edition of the film is even better than the theatrical release -- good to the last bite.",N/A

I didn't go to the lengths of killing the one I hated, as the character did in this story, but, I know that feeling of hopelessness, of doing the same thing over and over, even after mercy.It really stirred me up, knowing that this happens in real life, that little girls are raped and molested, and their mothers don't protect them.  Makes your blood boil.  I loved the vinettes each of the characters gave, which helped me get the story from their perspective. So, when the mother gave hers, I felt so much emotion of disgust.  Yet, she reasoned it like this:  ""I didn't deny it all for either of them, but for me.  It was a selfish thing, cause I don't want to be alone.""

But the film became watchable as the child characters became more prominent, bringing humor and interesting personalities to a story whose lead characters generate no interest whatsoever. You would have to like Christine and Richard to like the film, and they fell completely flat for me. But the kids are its saving grace. Brandon Ratcliffe as Robbie is especially natural and charming. Miranda July, who wrote and directed the film as well as stars in it, takes an intelligent, respectful approach to children, which I think is the film's strength. It's weakness is that this is extremely self-indulgent filmmaking.

731262,"`Learn the startling answer in this expertly crafted thriller from director Peter Rader (co-writer of Waterworld).'  This is part of the editorial review listed on Amazon for the film Grandmother's House aka Grandma's House (1988).  If this was meant as an enticement, it didn't work, as I saw Waterworld, and I didn't think it was all that great...maybe it had something to do with a man (or mutant, as the case may be) drinking his own wiz...I think Kevin Costner should have to enjoy a cup of his own urinations for each person subjected to his vanity projects...but I digress...this review is for the Image Entertainment release of the film, which lists the title as Grandmother's House and claims to be the 2003 version...there was a previous DVD release of this film titled Grandma's House, and it's essentially the same film with a few differences (I'll explain more later).The film, directed by Peter Rader (Hired to Kill), stars Eric Foster (Death House) and Kim Valentine (.com for Murder) as recently orphaned siblings David and Lynn, respectively, who are sent to live with their grandparents, played by Len `Uncle Leo' Lesser (Seinfeld, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Kelly's Heroes) and Ida Lee (It Runs in the Family).  Also appearing is scream queen and B movie fav Brinke Stevens (Repligator, Horrorvision, Mark of the Astro-Zombies).  The film starts out with a funeral, as Eric and Lynn are paying respects to their recently deceased father (apparently, their mother passed sometime earlier).  How did he die?  Don't know, don't care, doesn't matter...after arriving at their grandparent's orange farm in California (southern California, by the look), things seem all right at first, but the appearance of a rather scary looking woman (Stevens) heralds a world of trouble as David and Lynn discover every family has skeletons in their closet, and some literally...(okay, there are no skeletons in this film, but I thought it sounded kinda cool).Despite many flaws, I found much to like about this film, even though, based on the title, I was expecting something a little different (I thought it might have been a modern retelling of the story of Little Red Riding Hood).  So what was wrong with the film?  Well, for starters, the script seemed half-baked, and I don't mean that in the way one would describe someone who uses the Maui Wowie, but in terms of not being fully realized.  At times it did work, but then other times it seemed, well, lacking substance, not feeling very realistic....and this wasn't helped by often weak performances.  Most of the main actors did well, about as well as you'd expect for this kind of film, but the secondary players tended to stink to the point where they really stood out.  This is painfully illustrated by two specific performances, one by Furley Lumpkin (seriously, that's his real name) who played an off duty deputy, and Michael Robinson, who played Lynn's overly amorous love interest Kenny.  A side note...did anyone else find it a lot creepy that Kenny, who was clearly in his mid 20's, should have such an infatuation with Lynn, a girl who seemed to be between the ages of 15 and 17?  His definition of a date subsisted of thinly veiled innuendoes and a whole lot of groping...ick...the plot got bogged down a few times as it tried to develop a sense of danger where there really wasn't any, similar to a shoddy mystery that pushes the `red herrings' too hard (the scene where the shotgun toting grandfather is searching the house for David comes to mind...it was shot well, and created a good amount of edginess, but ultimately led nowhere).  Another thing that kind of bothered me, and I see this a lot in horror films, involves the antagonistic character played by Brinke Stevens, who was pretty effective, even though she didn't have much dialogue.  Often she would move throughout the film, magically appearing here and there with relative ease...I would have thought she was twins, or even triplets, the way she got around.  So what was good about the film?  Well, for the most part the story held up well (the relevant parts), and the director did better than I would have expected in creating tension, avoiding a lot of cheap tactics (pop out scares and such), cultivating the suspense and keeping me interested (he was also helped by genuinely decent musical score).  Most of the film took place in the large farmhouse and the surrounding grove, both of which were used well.  As I said before, the main actors did pretty well (I did get annoyed with Eric Foster rather quickly, I suppose mainly because he sported a `flock of seagulls' haircut throughout nearly the entire film).  I liked the twists and turns in the plot, but that last one seemed to come out of nowhere, and there wasn't really anything to support it within the film (unless I missed it).  All in all I'd say this is a pretty watchable film, better than most in its' class, and worth a look if you're interested in a eerie little thriller with more scares than blood.This release from Image Entertainment is labeled the 2003 version, and claims to have restored audio and video elements.  The wide screen (1:85.1) anamorphic picture does look pretty good, but there are a few, minor flaws (nothing to get upset about).  The DVD boasts five different audio channels in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround for English, French, German and Italian, along with Dolby Digital 2.0 in English.  Special features include a featurette titled `The Films of Nico Mastorakis, Part II' (he's the producer, and I am unsure where part I is located), a theatrical trailer, filmographies and biographies.  One thing I learned from this film is when running through an orange grove, it's better to keep your eyes focused in front of you than behind...as I'm sure David would agree...ouch...Cookieman108",N/A
710040,"There was one other reviewer here who was definately right.  ""ABBA: The Definative Collection"" on CD is really all you need.  ABBA is great music.  I don't know any female singers who can match their talent and energy when they sing.However, these videos are nothing impressive.  Lasse Hallstrom should only just be mentioned for making these mediocre videos.  He certainly deserves no outstanding praise.  You would think that it would be exciting to watch these girls sing these songs.  But these girls don't look like they are expressing the energy that you would expect to see with these exciting songs.  If I were allowed to mildly exaggerate just a little, in many cases here, it looks like we are just looking at a photograph, and they creatively made the lips move.  They look very stiff, and perhaps a little bored, and if they are dancing, they just seem to be making only a half-hearted effort to just sway to the music.  Don't you think that ""Dancing Queen"" should have had some talented expressive dancing?  As a video, the energy just isn't here.  They look like they filmed the video just after waking them up.  They must have edited out all the yawns.The girls are beautiful, of course, but these videos are just not that interesting.  And since these songs are only available on this DVD as 2.0 stereo, having the CD of these fabulous songs is a great deal more of a bargain.  Because the sound quality is what you would want to improve on if you're going to listen to ABBA's music.And it wouldn't hurt them if they tried to be a little sexier.  There is no sensual teasing in any of these videos.  But, yes I know, most of these videos are made long before the MTV video age.  But, regardless, every ABBA fan should have this video collection.  However, I get more out of ABBA when I just shut my eyes and listen to their beautiful songs.I think their most impressive song is ""Chiquitita"".  It is a perfect song!  Beautiful guitar and orchestration, and the girls hit some fabulous high notes, and with pristine synchronized harmony.  But again, the video here, is just weak and unimpressive.""ABBA: The Definative Collection"" on CD is good, but you really should check out the 4 CD box set of ""Thank You For the Music"".  All their best and more are in this collection, and what's more, the fourth disc has some excellent rarities from their entire career span.  On the fourth disc, they have a 22 minute collage piece called ""Abba Undeleted"", that is just fabulous to listen to.  They ran a bunch of unfinished songs together, mixed in with some of their session talking in their native tongue, and some instrumentation samples and some cute laughter.  Within this collage of many songs, there is a song in there called ""Just Like That"".  I really do wish that they would have completed and released this song as a single.  I have no doubt that it would have been their biggest hit ever made.Believe me, if you don't buy all these albums on CD separately, than you, at least, should have their 4 CD collection called ""Thank You For the Music"".",N/A
862273,"There are two reasons why I don't rate this 5 stars. It is historically incorrect in several parts. For instance, Fred Astaire sang Night And Day on Broadway, not some guy named Jack. And there is a bit too much about the sex life of Porter. I just fast forward past those scenes and watch the musical numbers, which are great. People who complain about the arrangements are off the wall. This was made in 2004, why should they rehash the same old arrangements? The music is great and the sound and staging is beautiful. The CD is also terrific. We loved it. If you like musicals and you like classic songs, you'll enjoy it, as long as you truly believe that someone else besides Sinatra and Ella can perform these songs!",N/A
886302,"Young Eddie becomes an orphan when his pilot father dies in a plane crash, and is left in the guardianship of his uncle, U.S. Air Force Major Haley (Stanley Tucci), who leaves the parenting to his housekeepers, (Dana Delany and Rub&eacute;n Blades). We follow Eddie as a child (Max Madore), but mostly in his teen years. Ryan Merriman gives a convincing and sensitive portrayal of Eddie as a youth, struggling to find his identity, falling in love without the ability to adequately express his feelings, and the inevitable drama that comes with growing into adulthood.Though the plot is sometimes predictable, there are many intense moments, and the acting by all is excellent. Tucci, Blades and Delany are all terrific, and as Eddie's love interest, Paula Garc&eacute;s is lovely as Francesca, a girl with an abusive and controlling father (Daniel O'Haco).I'm partial to films that are about flight, and single engine airplanes are a central part of this story, which is well written and directed by James Redford (son of Robert) in his film directorial debut, based on the novel by Donald Everett Axinn. The cinematography by Paul Ryan is wonderful, with beautifully framed shots, and the aerial photography stupendous.Set in Arizona in the 1950s, it has a good feel for the era, and the place.Family friendly with no gratuitous violence, this is a quiet, sensitive coming-of-age film that won't set the world on fire, but is nice, satisfying viewing, and is probably the start of a long career for Ryan Merriman.Total running time is 107 minutes.",N/A
879088,"After decades in legal limbo, the classic SCTV episodes are finally available to the public on an ever-growing assortment of DVD box sets. This third volume documents the various changes that occurred over a crucial ten-month period in 1982. The most obvious change was the arrival of Martin Short, which coincided with the departure of Rick Moranis, Dave Thomas and Catherine O'Hara. A less noticable change was the gradual disappearance of the laugh tracks; this was a subtle indication that the cast was becoming more attentive to style and craft.During a ten-month period in 1982, only nine original episodes were aired, and that's a lot of reruns. The writers were simply not prolific enough to satisfy the demand for more high-quality material. In addition, the cast now seemed reluctant to indulge in physical humor, preferring the quiet character-driven comedy that was Second City's trademark. The only time you saw an energetic performance was when they were making fun of energetic performers, such as Eugene Levy's manic impression of Borscht Belt comic Jack Carter, Martin Short's brutal take on Jerry Lewis, or Andrea Martin's blaring imitation of Ethel Merman's singing voice.The bonus features in this box set include a CD of live sketches and songs from the Second City archives (now the property of Sony) with narration from Second City alum Robert Klein. The sound quality varies from track to track, but it's still fascinating listening for comedy historians. Fans may be surprised to learn that Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara only worked together in a handful of episodes; this box set includes a hilarious new interview where the two crack each other up with impromptu impressions.The last episode in this box set features Rick Moranis' swan song for SCTV; his ""Soapy Maxwell"" piece ends with him walking off the set after an awkward pause because the scene has no ending. Dave Thomas as Bill Needle exits sentimentally, Jimmy Durante-style, after announcing his retirement from TV. Catherine O'Hara would return for guest appearances along with Thomas, but she chose not to make a grand farewell in this final episode. Her performance in ""Love Slaves Of The Southwest"" is a fascinating character study.Technical note: three major edits have been made because of publishing rights issues. A John Belushi farewell tribute has been deleted from the ""Great White Palace"" episode, Rick Moranis' polka version of ""Stairway To Heaven"" has been awkwardly edited from the ""Happy Wanderers"" piece, and Bill Murray's scene from ""Days Of The Week"" no longer uses ""Mrs. Robinson"" as its theme. Despite these deletions, I'm still recommending this box set as high-class entertainment - just don't throw out your old videotape copies yet.",N/A

The consequence being that until they repay the money owed, each one will lose a finger for each day the payment is late.While trying to figure their desperate predicament, they overhear their gangster neighbors setting up a score from some slumberous marijuana dealers and decide that knocking over the neighbours is their only way out.After the triumphant thievery, they discover that the pot belongs to the same menacing individual they want to fence it through - a black psychopath whose history reads like the Anti-Christ's resume. Enter a miscellany of desperadoes and hoodlums who target our four lads.For the first time since 'Pulp Fiction', a movie comes along that breaks the shackles of tedious cloning. This film is entertaining and moves along at a cracking pace. Guy Ritchie's script is a tapestry of well-written characters, sharp dialogue that says what needs to be said and leaves the unsaid as food for thought, and a mesh of sub-plots that interlace together with imagination and expertise.His direction is crisp and inventive allowing the cast of eccentric characters to move about freely while maintaining that erratic edge. In this slick piece of film making, Guy Ritchie denies hackneyed Hollywood trends by scripting no true good-guys just varying degrees of bad ones.This is a terrific movie. It is violent but not extreme considering the subject matter and cast of cut-throat characters. The language is strong and the humor is black where you'll find yourself belly laughing at the brutal misfortune of others. If this makes you uncomfortable, then this film is not for you. It is also not for those who have been trained by television sit-coms to laugh on cue.Broadminds are required to enjoy this fine British film where it will definitely add some zing to your day.

The claustrophobia and the proximity of death begin to affect the inhabitants of the building.  The true personalities begin to afflorate.

661537,"Let me begin by saying I absolutely love South Pacific. It was the very first musical I ever saw (my parents took me to the movie when it came out, when I was hardly more than an infant) and I grew up listening to the Broadway sound track.I'm a big fan of Harry Connick Jr.'s musical work, and I think he's an excellent actor. I've been impressed by Glen Close's work, I think Robery Pastorelli is a pretty decent comic actor, and when I saw the ""Making of South Pacific"" promo on TV, I made a point of setting my VCR to catch the movie. I was ready to really enjoy this show.And boy, was I let down. First of all, no matter how good she looks, Glen Close does not look like a young nurse. She doesn't even look like a middle aged nurse. In her scenes with Rade Sherbedgia, despite all the soft focus photography (and half of this movie looked like it was shot through a pound of vaseline) she didn't look anything like a young woman swept off her feet by an older man. To tell the truth, she looked like Sherbedgia's mother. When Nellie sings that she's just a simple girl and Emil is a sophisticated man, it borders on the tragicomic.But what makes or breaks a great musical is the singing. Both the Broadway and the original Hollywood versions of this movie were characterized by great voices. The part of Emile de Becque was played on Broadway by Ezio Pinza, and on the screen sung by Giorgio Tozzi, both strong and expressive baritones with an operatic background. The ingenue leads were the great Mary Martin and Mitzi Gaynor. Even the smaller parts were played by dynamic performers like Broadway's Juanita Hall, whose ""Bali Hai"" sends chills down your back.But these TV version is completely lacking in anything approaching a dynamic vocal performance. Connick, an excellent singer in his own genre, does a workmanlike job with ""Younger Than Springtime"" and then delivers a half-spoken, half sung and essentially emotionless version of ""You've Got To Be Taught"". Sherbedgia, who has some of the strongest songs in the show, can barely produce a whisper. When Pinza sang ""This Once Was Mine"" it brought tears to your eyes; when Sherbedgia sings it, it's incidental music. It's almost as if the entire cast were picked so as not to show up the limited vocal abilities of the star.All in all a tremendous disappointment. Even if you liked the TV version- especially if you liked it- you owe it to yourself to buy the Broadway album and hear this music as it was meant to be heard.",Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific VHS

It's a great little film, beautifully shot, about a boy and his best friend -- a red balloon. On a deeper level I think the film explores the hostility and jealousy of mankind towards the love and friendship of others and the sinful drive of mankind to destroy beauty.

Wonderful book by Harper Lee, strong adaptation by Horton Foote, perfect casting, starting with Gregory Peck, understated directing by Pakula, mesmerising music by Elmer Bernstein.The film itself never looked or sounded better than on this DVD. I have not tried some of the other releases to compare.  But the extras are just minimum.  The conversation with Gregory Peck? It is more of a home movie than an interview. You see him talk about his work for a total of less than 10 minutes. The rest of the time you see him with a lot of other people (presumably his family but the credits do not say), eating figs, just hanging out. I was hoping to hear him talk about his role and what he thought it meant.  Anyone else in the film?  Forget about them. Scout is the only other person involved that you see, and that was a wonderful extra.  You see Foote for maybe a minute and the great Elmer Bernstein for a total of 30 seconds.Come on Hollywood, this is one of the best films ever made, you can give us more than this.  We get more extras than this for any Batman or Halloween picture.If I had it to do over, I would probably just hang on to my VHS and wait until somebody did this right.Or if they released this DVD at less than a premium price.

818860,"For those of you who aren't familiar with Gravitation, either the anime or the manga, here's a brief explanation.  Shuichi, the lead singer and songwriter of his band, is out walking one night and gets the lyrics of one of his new songs severely criticized by a mysterious, scary, and handsome man, the writer Eiri Yuki (technically Yuki Eiri, if you're watching the Japanese).  So begins Shuichi's obsession with Yuki, leading to their sometimes cute and certainly turbulent relationship.  Yes, they date each other, live together, and are both guys.  If you strongly disapprove of this sort of thing, then you shouldn't buy this anime.  However, the only thing you'll see on screen is a few kisses and some implied sex.  The series mostly revolves around Shuichi's band and Yuki and Shuichi's relationship.The Story Itself: To tell you the truth, this first volume is not the best.  The story takes a few episodes to really warm up.  Still, I wouldn't recommend beginning with the second volume, since you'd miss out on a lot.  I just remember being worried, because I'd gone out and bought all four volumes ($20 a pop, eek!) and was wondering if I'd made a mistake.  It really does get better, and these first episodes were definitely rewatchable after I realized that.  The JPop music that is a big part of this anime is really pretty good, so you might find yourself wanting to buy the soundtracks after watching this.The Voice Acting: When I get new Japanese anime, I first watch everything with the English dub, unless this is too painful to bear (I had that problem with Full Metal Panic).  This way, I can get all the plot without having the watch subtitles, which might make me miss important and/or pretty visuals.  Gravitation's English voice acting isn't awful, although there are certainly far better dubs out there (Fruits Basket and Cowboy Bebop, for instance).  Of all the English dub voices, my favorites were K, Tohma, and Hiro.  I now usually watch Gravitation in the original Japanese, because those voices are really excellent.  It helps that Yuki's Japanese voice actor, Kazuhiko Inoue (who also voices Kakashi in Naruto), is one of my absolute favorite male Japanese voice actors.The Extras: If you buy this licensed version, like I did, good for you, although you, like me, will probably spend more than you would like to.  The extras are good enough to make the price paid seem not as horrible as it could have been.  I know, that sounds wishy washy, but I always feel awful about paying $20 or more for only three episodes of something, especially when the episodes are only about 20 minutes each.  Such is the sad life of an anime fan.  Anyway, this disk includes a US trailer for Gravitation that I have never seen on anywhere besides this disk.  There are also episode liner notes that are helpful for understanding some of the puns and thoroughly Japanese bits of the episodes.  There are also profiles of Shuichi, Fujisaki, and Hiro, and an art gallery with black and white line drawings.  This disk's trailers include His and Her Circumstances, Comic Party, Boogiepop Phantom, Shingu, Dangaizer 3, and KO Beast.Overall Verdict: I've watched Gravitation over and over, so I would recommend this.  However, the price is a consideration, especially since these episodes are not collected in a boxed set that would make things a little cheaper than buying one disk at a time.  Some people may have problems with Shuichi, who can be whiny and annoying, or Yuki, who can be a cold jerk.  Also, people with hang-ups about guy/guy relationships will probably have issues with this series.  Finally, if you don't like JPop, this series will be a problem.  If none of that is an issue for you, than by all means, buy this disk and the rest of the series.  It's a bit cheaper than buying all the manga.  And a quick word about that: the anime is not the manga - there are a ton of differences between the two.  The anime shortens the overall story, which I found a bit disappointing, since I think this could've been a good 26 episode series, instead of 13.  Several characters get cut or shortchanged due to this fact, and Shuichi and Yuki's relationship gets less development than I would have liked.  However, on the plus side, the characters in the anime have much more stable personalities (Shuichi and especially Yuki's personalities seemed to fluctuate with every book in the manga), and the story is more cohesive.",N/A

624048,"Dodgeball...I remember it well, back from my grade school days...always aim for the face...or the `nads...and now there's actually league of adults out there playing it on a professional level?  I'll never understand the absurdity of the regressive attitudes tied into taking the simplistic games we enjoyed playing when we were children and turning them into professional sporting events...I dunno, it kinda takes the magic out of being a kid...just my opinion, I suppose.  Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Terry Tate, Office Linebacker), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) stars Vince Vaughn (Old School, Be Cool) and Ben Stiller (Meet the Parents, Starsky & Hutch).  Also appearing is Stiller's wife Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movie, The Wedding Singer), Rip Torn (The Beastmaster, Airplane II: The Sequel), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), Stephen Root (""NewsRadio"", Office Space), Joel Moore (Art School Confidential), Chris Williams (Friday After Next), Alan Tudyk (I, Robot), Jason Bateman (""Arrested Development""), and Hank Azaria, the man behind the voice of Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu, Comic Book Guy, Cletus, Prof. Frinkon, to name a few, on the TV show The Simpsons.As the movie begins we meet a character by the name of Peter La Fleur (Vaughn), owner and proprietor of the Average Joe's Gym.  Business could certainly be better, but then Peter seems a soft touch, especially since he hasn't collected dues from his rather unique and distinctive membership (one guy thinks he's a pirate, and swears he'll pay off his debt once he remembers where he buried his treasure) in over a year.  Anyway, seems the bank is in the process of foreclosure, prompted by Peter's competition in that of the highly narcissistic White Goodman (Stiller), who runs the high tech Globo Gym `Here at Globo Gym we're better than you, and we know it' across the street, having designs on acquiring the property, leveling it, and turning it into a auxiliary parking lot for his elite clientele.  Peter learns from bank representative Kate Veatch (Taylor) that in order to save his gym he needs to raise $50,000 within 30 days, a seemingly insurmountable task, but opportunity comes in the form of a dodgeball tournement, one where the team that wins the finals, held in Las Vegas, is awarded a prize of the exact amount needed to save the gym.  Goodman learns of Peter's plan, organizes his own team, including a scary uni-brow female ringer from some Soviet breakaway republic, to ensure his nefarious scheme doesn't fail, but Peter and his band of sorry, uncoordinated geeks, losers, and oddballs finds help in that of 7 time dodgeball all star Patches O'Houlihan (Torn), who signs on as their coach (utilizing some unusual techniques and also having some of the best lines)...will the boys prevail?  Perhaps, but they're going to need some serious help, a little luck, and a whole lot of balls...This movie is worth watching if nothing else than to see Justin Long getting clobbered in the face with a wrench...oh, I know it was a rubber prop, but still, it looked darn realistic, and elicited a strange sense of satisfaction from myself.  I've got nothing against Justin Long as a person, but his character Warren Parker Cheswick on the television series `Ed' was just so darn annoying.  The story is pretty formulaic in terms of a rag tag bunch of misfits rising above their own inadequacies to achieve a common goal, facing impossible odds and adversity every step of the way, but the difference is the various interesting characters.  I thought all the actors did really well, but Stiller kinda needs to find a new schtick as I feel like I've seen his psycho, over-the-top characterization a number of times, with small variances.  I actually like him better when he's downplaying his roles in a self-effacing manner as in There's Something About Mary (1998) or Meet the Parents (2000)...yeah, his character did get a little nutso in those movies, but it was brief, and within context, and worked better in small doses.  I've never been a huge fan of Vaughn, ever since he appeared in that remake of Psycho (1998), but he fit in nicely here as the sort of smart alecky leader and wasn't relied on to carry the film as he got a lot of help from a good supporting cast.  The direction was good, as Thurber kept things moving along at a good pace, although the film did slow down a bit in the third act, despite all the scenes of intense competition in terms of teams battling to get into the finals.  In one of the commentaries, Thurber stated he actually left the film for a week, as the studio didn't like his original ending, which is included as a special feature.  I saw it, and thought it was better than the one used, and I can only imagine the reactions of those who attended pre-screening...oh well, I guess you really can't fight the power.  At least we get to see Christine Taylor kiss another woman, and that's gotta be worth something.  Some of my favorite scenes involved the training tactics used by Rip Torn's character (""If you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ball.""), which involved the scene, as I mentioned earlier, of Justin Long's character's face having an unfriendly encounter with a tool.  All in all this was a pretty silly movie, but highly entertaining, especially if you like to see guys hit in the crotch with large, rubber balls (I know I do).The widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) picture on this DVD looks sharp, and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through clearly.  Special features include a commentary track with Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, and director-writer Rawson Marshall Thurber, nine deleted/extended scenes and an alternate ending with optional commentary by writer/director Thurber, footage (with introduction by Thurber) of the Dodgeball Dancers (Yowsa!), some entertaining featurettes titled `Dodgeball Boot Camp: Training for Dodgeball',  `The Anatomy of a Hit', `Justin Long: A Study in Ham & Cheese', `Dodgeball: Go for the Gold', a blooper/gag reel, 2 theatrical trailers for the film, along with ones for Garden State (2004), and There's Something About Mary (1998), the screenplay on DVD-ROM, and a few, easy to find Easter eggs featuring Stiller in a fat suit poking fun at those who scour DVDs for hidden features.Cookieman108Also, keep you eyes peeled for a lot of great cameos, especially the coach of the German team...nice to see he's still getting work...",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition
290276,"Remote Control is a bad, yet enjoyable 80's sci-fi movie-within-a-movie about Aliens trying to take over the world that stars two less talented younger siblings of famous actors of the era--Kevin Dillon and Jennifer Tilly.Remember back in the 80's, when home video was new, and there was a mom and pop video store on every corner?  You know, back before Blockbuster put them all out of business?  Meg's younger sister plays the hot chick who comes into the little no name video store to ask for some crappy sci-fi movie from the 50's.  Since this was way back when video rental was a new concept, and people were a lot less picky, it's already checked out.  The video comes in after the store closes, and the boss tells Matt's little brother that he has to deliver it to her house, despite the fact that she's only asked about it, and not actually paid for it yet.That's an unusual rental policy, you may say to yourself, my video store never gives me front door service.  Well, it's actually a much more common practice than you would think.  As a former video store employee, as well as a female sci-fi/horror fan, I happen to know that ALL sci-fi/horror geeks who work in video stores have a policy of giving front door service to anyone who comes in asking for some ultra geeky sci-fi or horror movie, if they also happen to be really hot chicks.  This is most common among hot women who ask for Star Wars movies, but is not limited to one series or gender.  Also, and this is probably just a coincidence, but those people don't tend to rack up very many late fees, either.As you can probably guess, the video tape she wants turns out to be a means for the Aliens to control our minds and take over the world.  So this movie was obviously the key influence in Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu.""  Now, when I watched this movie, I naturally asked myself, ""hmmm...if I were an Alien race planning to mutate and take over the world, would I want to control people's minds via an old crappy sci-fi movie from the 50's that nobody remembers, or would I go for the new summer blockbuster that people keep calling the video store every ten minutes and asking about?""  Then, when the movie had ended, I became aware of how mushy my brain felt, and I realized that this wasn't a flaw in the plot at all.  It was just that the kind of people who enjoy watching old crappy sci-fi movies like this one are much easier for the aliens to reach that those who want, ""Schindler's List.""  (Although, if they wanted my advice, I would have recommended using ""Fools Rush In,"" starring Matthew Perry, for its insipid brain-numbing, as well as its mass appeal.)Perhaps that funniest thing about this movie is that it's just as bad as the 50's sci-fi movie it's trying to make fun of.  I tried to come up with a good metaphor to explain what it's the cinematic equivalent of, but I couldn't think of anything too profound.  So just think of something you've experienced that you wouldn't want to do again, but didn't actually hurt you, and you've got it.  It's got that cool 80's New Wave look, but if you're looking for sci-fi of that flavour, you should check out another 80's flick called ""Liquid Sky"" instead.",Remote Control VHS
429221,"Fromn the get-go this movie stays boring and stale. This had to be a made for TV movie, i'll wet myself laughing if they claimed this was a motion picture.A sceintist geniticly altered a bunch of bats and then they escape and attack when there called via remote. The ugly cop and her new dopey love interest & local animal control expert are on the case while his annoying and cant act for s*** daughter and boyfriend think there news reporters who keep follwing them around looking for an exclusive. All in a small and corrupted town.This is obviosly a TV movie. It plays more like a pathetic soap opera with slight attempts at humor from time to time, while adding killer mutated bats into the mix. It is neither a horror, nor suspence. There is nothing frightining about the film except for the bad acting. It's a no wonder you wont have seen these actors before, nor will you in future. The effects of gore are laying a cows rib bones on the back of an actor and then hanging plastic bats over him then add some badly created CGI shadows to create an effect thats so bad it's not even laughable.The movie is a waste of time. If you wanna see a Bat movie, then the actual title BATS was a better movie, but, it wasnt great either... but leaves this one for dead.Rent it if you feel ill and have the need to puke at bad acting.",N/A

783026,"""I can't say the service was up to scratch. It smacked of the conveyor belt. In fact, I wrote to the crematorium. I said I thought the hallmark of a ceremony of that nature was reverence, whereas the word that kept coming to my mind was 'brisk.' Moreover, I added, grief-stricken people do not expect to emerge from the chapel of rest to find grown men skulking in the rhododendron with tab ends in their mouths. If the hearse drivers must smoke, then facilities should be provided. I'd heard good things about this crematorium but I hoped that they would agree with me that on this occasion it had let itself down."" And with that, Miss Ruddock, a lonely middle-aged woman, has written another of her many letters. Soon, her letters will change her life, and not for the better.This is one of three, 30-minute monologues written by Alan Bennett for Patricia Routledge. They are part of a series of monologues Bennett wrote for the BBC under the title Talking Heads and Talking Heads II. This excerpt is from A Lady of Letters. Another on this disc is A Woman of No Importance, where Miss Schofield is late to lunch and visits her doctor. The third is Miss Fozzard Finds Her Feet. Miss Fozzard works in a department store and finds her life changed when her brother has a stroke. It changes even more when she visits a chiropodist.In my view, Bennett is one of Britain's great playwrights to emerge in the second half of the twentieth century. His Talking Heads series may seem like an interminable idea...actors playing characters who relate their stories while talking to the camera for thirty minutes each. In fact, these stories are engrossing. If you enjoy writing that can be funny and tragic at the same time, give these a try. Bennett's characters most often are people wrapped up in their own lives, sometimes complacent, constrained by what they believe is proper behavior, often oblivious to what others think of them or how conditions are changing around them. They are people you might not like at first, or may feel pity for, but who, as they tell their stories, become touching and often sad.Bennett's stories wouldn't work, however, unless he had extraordinary actors to use. Patricia Routledge probably is best known in the United States as Hyacinth Bucket and Hetty Wainthropp on television. She's a versatile actress who has won just about every award there is in Britain. She does a wonderful job of letting us know each of these different women. Miss Schofield comes close to heartbreaking as she keeps her illlusions. Miss Ruddock is exasperating and then almost tragic. Miss Fozzard fares the best, but is unsettled. ""I've never had the knack of making things happen,"" she says. ""I thought things happened or they didn't. Which is to say, they didn't. Only now they have. Sort of.""The three monologues were recorded over a span of more than ten years. The color looks good and the pictures are crisp. As extras there is a short television play by Bennett from 1982 with Routledge and a BBC interview featuring both Bennett and Routledge.",N/A
116999,"Quo Vadis is the absolute best movie that never won an Academy Award. At the time of its release in 1951, it was the 2nd highest box office of any movie in history (Gone With the Wind was the highest). It was the first of the many historical epics of the 1950's and early 1960's. It is also the best.Robert Taylor plays Roman general Marcus Vinicius, commander of the 14th Legion, and Deborah Kerr portrays a Christian lady, Lygia, that he falls in love with. Lygia is a hostage of Rome and Vinicius arranges with the mad Emperor Nero (Peter Ustinov) to have her reassigned to him. She runs away to the shelter provided by other Christians for fugitives from ""Roman justice.""Meanwhile, Nero wants to go down in history as being the greatest artist of all time. He is assisted in trying to come up with both ideas and proper wording by Petronius (Leo Genn). These scenes are great fun as Petronius does a wonderful job as the emperors' faithful counselor, and with his great wit manipulates the pompous and vicious Nero. By doing so, he helps protect the Roman populace from the evil emperor.Also going on at this time is the growth of Christianity in Rome. Both Saint Paul (Abraham Sofaer) and Saint Peter (Finlay Currie) are present in Rome. The 2 saints hold services in the Roman catacombs. Christianity is a secretive religion since the adherents of Christ are under constant threat of persecution.Eventually, Nero gets the idea that for him to create an artistic masterpiece, then suffering on a colossal scale must first take place. He orders his chief yes man, Tigellinus (Ralph Truman), the commander of the Praetorian Guard, to set fire to Rome and also to block the escape of the Roman population across the bridge to achieve maximum slaughter. Tigellinus carries out Nero's cruel decree and one of the greatest fires in history resulted. After Nero announces both his decision and also his plans to rebuild Rome under the name ""Neropolis,"" Vinicius bolts and goes to Rome in his chariot and succeeds in overcoming the Praetorians at the bridge to save multitudes from death.The Roman people quickly figure out that Nero was the ""incendiary"" resposible for the burining of their beloved city. However, Nero decides with the help of his slutty Empress Poppaea (Patricia Laffan) that in order to deflect the blame from him, a victim needs to be scapegoated. From there, he decides that the Christians, who refuse to engage in worshiping the emperor as a god, make the best victims. Nero then decrees that it was the Christians who burned Rome and as such, they are to be all rounded up and fed to the lions in the colisseum as public entertainment.Quo Vadis is a magnificent major motion picture. It has beautiful scenery, wonderful costumes and fantastic cinematography, and is as accurate a capture of ancient Rome as was possible with 1951 technology. The set designs are sheer artistry. Quo Vadis is a stunning spectacle with an excellent script, fine performances and holds up very well today.The best part of this movie is Peter Ustinov's performance as the mad Emperor Nero. Ustinov is totally focused on the role so much so that he captures the screen in the scenes that he is in. Ustinov's performance is the absolute best portrayal of Nero yet given by an actor in a movie. Ustinov plays the role instead of converting the character into a reflection of himself. Ustinov should have won the Academy Award for his performance. He did, however, win the Golden Globe.Thus far, Quo Vadis is the absolute best Roman epic ever made. The decor, costumes, and art direction certainly have not been matched by anything that followed, including Spartacus, Ben Hur and Gladiator. Quo Vadis is an excellent movie that is certainly well worth your time.",N/A
381876,"The 1995 classic basketball movie ""Above The Rim"" is a great movie, even though it is going on ten years old. However, time can not erase the fact that this movie is spectacular. The cast of characters is good, the script is good, and overall this is an awesome movie if you're a fan of Tupac Shakur, or just a fan of basketball movies with more than just basketball in it.The story is about Kyle Watson (Duane Martin) and Tommy ""Shep"" Sheppard (Leon). Kyle is really into basketball and he plays for the high school team, but he's a little self centered on the court. When his friend Bugaloo (Marlon Wayans) busts out of jail, he introduces Kyle to Birdie (Tupac Shakur), who wants to put Kyle on his annual Shoot Out Tournament team. Even though Kyle told his coach he was going to play for him in the shoot-out, he decides to play for Birdie, as he offers him somewhat of a better or good life. This part of the story is kinda cliche, either sell your soul for riches or do the right thing and go the better way out. Which one will Kyle choose when it's time? Shep has a story of his own. From what I could tell, Shep was a very good ballplayer when he was Kyle's age. Due to a certain tragedy, Shep threw it all away. Shep comes back from where he ran to, and ends up meeting Kyle's mother, and starts dating her. Kyle doesn't like Shep at all, due to a little bit of Birdie's influence, who is tied to Shep. Turns out, Shep helps Kyle throughout the movie.There is not many extras on the DVD though. You could either get this on VHS or DVD and have the exact same thing. The movie has a great cast to back it up: Duane Martin, Marlon Wayans, Leon, Tupac Shakur, Tonya Pinkins, Bernie Mac, etc. They are all great in their roles. Despite being just about a decade old, this movie stands the test of time for me. It also has a great soundtrack, featuring hits such as ""Regulate"" by Nate Dogg and Warren G, and ""Pour Out A Little Liquor"" by 2Pac, and ""Pain"" by 2Pac and the Outlaws, which is one of my favorite songs. It really fits with the movie when they play it.However cliche the storyline may be, this is still an excellent movie. The acting is tremendous, especially by Tupac and Marlon Wayans. This movie also established Leon and Marlon as 2 of my favorite actors. If you're looking for a great basketball movie with enough drama to keep you entertained, other than basketball, then this is the movie for you. This is also a good addition to your 2Pac collection (R.I.P.) Go ahead and buy Above the Rim now!",Above the Rim VHS
598943,"I first bought Angel to tide myself over between Buffy season releases; I'd never followed the show when it was on the air.  This, it turns out, was a mistake; Angel was one of the best shows on television.  Not that it started out that way, not exactly.Angel was defined as its own show with a different basic format than Buffy:  Doyle would get a vision, and Angel (with help from Doyle and Cordelia) would go out and fix it.  The ""Help the Helpless"" angle would need a major overhaul before it could effectively drive the show; Angel at its best was a show about moral choices, and the show didn't come into its own until it began to deal with them seriously and primarily.The brief Doyle era contains some fun situations, and a lot of classic dialogue.  ""City of"" is wonderful, and ""I Will Remember You"" is deeply tragic (if you watch the first three seasons of Buffy to get the context).  ""Hero"" is really where the series first hints at the tough choices it will be about in the future.  Glenn Quinn's portrayal of the sarcastic Irish half-demon is what makes this fun; the stories themselves are still scrambling to find solid ground.When Alexis Denisof comes in full-time, it's pretty much unbelievable for the Buffy fan - Wesley was the least compelling character in Buffy season 3 by a long shot.  But he starts to grow and change, and by Angel's season 3, he was the most fascinating person in the Buffyverse.  And aside from ""Somnambulist,"" much of the midseason is middling at best.  It starts to pick up in ""Eternity,"" as we get another glimpse of Angelus; the group has meshed well and it seems to be getting an idea of where it ought to go.With the two-parter ""Five by Five"" and ""Sanctuary,"" Angel becomes its own show.  Following up on Buffy's two-part ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Are You?"", ""Five by Five"" brings the volatile Faith to Los Angeles; Angel as a character is finally presented with a real, hard situation of redemption and moral choice.  His fostering of Faith (a decision that turns out to have consequences for the best) makes for fascinating television, and ""Sanctuary"" solidifies that Angel/Buffy is no longer even an issue.  This is the real, quantifiable point when Angel becomes a better show than its companion.The characters keep making the tough decisions in ""War Zone,"" when the new, tough Gunn must stake a vamp that was his sister, and Angel must win his trust; ""Blind Date"" sets up nemesis Lindsey McDonald as a near-miss in terms of redemption (as if to make it clear that not every lost soul will be won as well as Faith was).  ""To Shanshu in L.A."" destroys the old offices, and puts the show on a footing that can handle its new emphasis on choice, consequences, and redemption.David Boreanaz was still growing as an actor here, coming out of Buffy (where his chemistry with Sarah Michelle Gellar carried him a long way) and into his own part; he did so well.  Charisma Carpenter is not the world's most versatile actress, but still hits all the notes for Cordelia quite well here, and fleshes her out somewhat - but not out of character.  Glenn Quinn is great as the comic side of the first nine episodes; Alexis Denisof replaces him with a funny side, but also starts to grow the layers that will serve him so well in later seasons.Once Angel found itself, it became the best thing on television.  You can see it happen here - and once you have, the next four seasons just become the natural thing to watch.",Angel - Season One
43989,"Alright...I'm not going to pretend that this film is unbiased.  It certainly is.  IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK is a powerful argument, divided amongst three independent segments, for providing a safe & secure means for women to seek abortions if they so choose.  In the first chapter, a women in the 1950s, cornered by guilt and shame, is forced to seek a back-alley abortion--a method that leaves her devastated.  The closing scene of this first chapter is absolutely horrific and a powerful argument for being pro-choice in and of itself.In the second chapter, set in the 1970s, the film tries to provide a balanced perspective on abortion by having the protagonist (a tired mother of five who has finally begun her own life again) choose to keep her child.  While it may have been intended as a half-argument for the pro-life side, it comes across as a martyr story.  The liberal audience will ignore her decision and wish that the mother were not so confined by her moral beliefs and indecision.The final chapter grants us a young female in the 1990s who comes across as a foolish girl, a girl who has become involved with her professor.  There's no real sympathy for this girl, but rather some anger at the professor's dismissive attitude.  No sympathy, that is, until the powerful scenes depicting the radical nature of the far-right of the pro-life movement.While this film may not be a ""balanced"" perspective on abortion, I believe that it does a nice job at humanizing the pro-choice movement.  IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK is not selling permiscuous sex without consequences.  Rather, it documents the hard-choices and horrible circumstances of unwanted pregnancy--a position that no one wants to be in.  In the end, the film delivers a powerful sentiment: One way or another, women are going to seek abortions.  They always have and always will.  Thus, we must ask ourselves if we should provide a safe & secure place for women to seek them.  My recommendation is for you to watch IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK a before you decide, regardless of your leanings.",N/A
757488,"I bought this after finding it by accident in a store. I've read in other reviews that much of the stuff here can be found on extras in other dvds through Natural Journeys. Possibly, I've got all Bellytwins and some other stuff, but they're bought a ways back and are on video, so I haven't benefited from those extras. But I did enjoy the dvd. There are four dancers, Rania probably the best known with all her fitness dvds out there. There is a variety of dancing, and each number is introduced with a brief description of the type of dancing, kind of song, and a couple other details (e.g., you usually don't see a dancer in Egypt showing her stomach). It was fun the watch the different styles and it can inspire you maybe try something different. I also have the bellydance superstars dvd, which I personally prefer. It has many more dancers on it, though each does only two numbers, and some of them I wish had done more, many more, especially. With this divas DVD, some dancers dance a lot more (Rania has something like six or seven numbers, while the first dancer only has two or three). I liked seeing the different costumes, too, where some looked like they were dancing in stretchy evening gowns while others were more what is usually seen (sexier I Dream of Jeannie fare). Overall, though, I liked it a lot and enjoy the performances,",N/A
903084,"Season 4 of Smallville started off with some promise: a quick 1 episode tease of Clark flying and the pick up of what happened to Chloe after the house explosion in the finale of season 3...etc......then it went downhill....Constant pointless storylines--mostly involving sex-centered situations.  My only guess as to the reason why they did this was to ""show the growth and maturity of the show"".  If that was the case, they were failing miserably--something I think they realized toward the end of the season.  It was very similar to what happened to Dawson's Creek in it's 3rd season:  it also had to bounce back from a degrading sexed up period.Another problem I had with this season was this:  Why the hell do we need Lois Lane so soon?  This show is about young Clark Kent before he moves to Metropolis to work at the Daily Planet (eventually meeting Lois Lane).  Sorry, but I'm confused here.  When Clark goes to Metropolis, he's wearing the dark framed glasses and portrays himself as a meek contrast to his SUPERMAN alter ego.  So, why then, does Lois get to see that Clark clearly is built like a rock (she sees him naked and/or shirtless through out the 4 season) AND without his glasses.  Granted there has always been that known joke about how horrible a disquise the glasses were for Clark Kent (yeah, like they really hide his features as being just like Superman), but understanding that we are supposed to suspend our disbelief to accept his glasses as being his disguise, WHY IS LOIS SEEING HIM PRE-GLASSES?!?  I mean, isn't she going to see him in Metropolis, years later, as SUPERMAN and go, hey, he kinda looks like that farm boy, Clark Kent?  I mean, c'mon!  Suspension of disbelief only goes so far!As far as Lex Luthor, his excuse could always be going a bit crazy the future---causing him to forget everything about knowing Clark Kent without the glasses and all of the strange coincidences surrounding him, but are we supposed to accept something like Lois getting a bump on the head and forgetting ever going to Smallville in the first place?  HELLO!!! We, the audience, are not that stupid!Maybe they could just bring that guy Kevin from the episode ""Blank"" back to erase her memory of ever meeting Clark?

890082,"After years of waiting, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is now available to own.  Truly a remarkable musical with drama, romance and a touch of tragedy, it is everything a muscial should be.  The cast is well played out, even though they had big shoes to fill.  Gerald Butler is a wonderful Phantom.  He brings a sexiness and youth to the role that previous Phantom I've seen did not.  You really do feel his obessive love for Christine and his pain when she betrays him.  Emmy Rossum is a wonderful Christine.  Emmy is a beautiful young lady who sings remarkably well.  It actually was more difficult for me to accept her as Christine than Butler as Phantom because this role was created specifically for Sarah Brightman.  However, Sarah is too old for the role now and Emmy does the job just as well.  Patrick Wilson (Raoul) was the one role I thought could have been improved in the movie.  I think they could have added a little star appeal to the movie and cast a hotter actor.  They dubbed Minnie Driver's voice, so dubbing another wouldn't have been that big of a deal.Overall, this movie has heart and keeps the spirit of the stage production.  The staging of this movie is simply stunning.  Minnie Driver's Carlotta adds for comic relief, as well as the opera house owners.The extras include a behind the scenes on how the show came to life.  It includes home videos of early productions and rehearsals with Sarah and Michael Crawford.  Truly, for this Phantom fan, this made the entire purchase sooooo worth it.

In this review I will give you a breif description of the characters and of the three incredible adventures!Wallace: Wallace is a kindharted, but absent minded inventor whose inventions always seem to need a few bugs worked out of them! He loves inventing, however, and is absoloutly mad about all kinds of gormet cheeses, but not without crackers!Gromit: Gromit does not talk, but his body language says it all. He is incredibly intellegent and sophistocated but not in a snobby way. He likes a good cup of tea and some corn flakes for breakfast (What? You think he eats dog food?!!) and loves to stay informed by reading the newspaper daily.A Grand Day Out: This is the first ever Wallace and Gromit cartoon in which Wallace comes up with the bright idea to go to the moon in search of the perfect cheese! ""Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese Gromit!"" So they build a rocket rather quickly and go to the moon for a grand day out.The Wrong Trousers: The wrong trousers is the second Wallace and Gromit cartoon in which Wallace invents a pair of robotic trousers to take Gromit for a walk. At the time desperate for money, Wallace decides to take in a boarder, a seemingly harmless, yet somehow suspicious penguin. Gromit quickly grows jelous of the penguin's time spent with Wallace and the fact that the Penguin took his room; forcing him to move into another room which is kind of a wreck! One day Gromit goes up to his room to find the Penguin up to no good!A Close Shave: THis is the most recent Wallace and Gromit Cartoon in which Wallace and Gromit take jobs as window washers. They find out the their best costomer's dog seems to be up to no good by trying to steal sheep for some reason unknown.I hope you found this long review helpful. Thanks for reading it!",N/A
397170,"""Mighty Aphrodite"" is by far, one of my top ten  Allen's movies. The undertaken invective around the Greek meaning of Aphrodite and the way he wisely bounds the concept respect the pros in the world of today is by itself worthy to hail.The initial shot focuses on a Greek temple and the chorus (smart device in the Greek Tragedy  at the moment to begin the whole drama)  works out as an accurate introduction respect the story which is about to be told.From Greece we fly to New York where the couple in question (Mrs. Bonham Carter  and Mr. Allen are discussing about having a child. But when she decides to adopt a baby, the first clues are given to us. Notice for instance the clever dialogue in which his son asks him: ""Who has the authority in this house?"" he replies: ""I have it but your mother is who takes the decisions"" clearly is suggesting - laughs apart - we have always lived the invisible domain of the woman in the marriage 8 and very specially into the Jew tradition).Then, comes the nucleus of the film: he decides tries to find the real  mother of this vary smart boy (From unknown origin; that reciprocal interest catches the our plain attention, so when he takes a ride he finds with (Oh, majuscule surprise she is our contemporary Aphrodite: Lisa Walsh (my always loved Mira Sorvino in a role who deserved her the Academy Award as Best Supporting actress).Needless to say. I guess that Allen is telling us that contrarily to the cold theory and ancestral tradition, Aphrodite and Athena are not two isolated archetypes; on the contrary they must be thought (As in the case of Dionysus and Apollo) a complex but united entity.The rest of the film is concerned with the process of redemption, his decision has been taken, he feels it's the time to be a passive spectator to become in part of the play. He feels her invaluable son must be accompanied of transformation and so, he will fight for getting her a good candidate for her to get married (and so become the Mother Goddess).So, you have the eternal dilemma of Pygmalion: to cement and crown the feminine role the blended role of Athena , Aphrodite and Mother Goddess. It's to say, what he (as  many men all over the world are pursuing conscious or not) has always wished : to gather all these archetypes in just one woman: a sublime ideal if you may, but the epic effort has to be made in order to make the possibility becomes real, due the process is by far, much more important that the goal by itself.At least this searching have been intended in many previous films such as Annie Hall. Manhattan, Hannah and her sisters and more recently Melinda and Melinda and Whatever works.So, beneath the hilarious situations plenty of incisive and bleak humour these reflections permeate the whole picture, making it a well rounded masterpiece.Watch it and enjoy it over and over again.",Mighty Aphrodite VHS
737782,"This is the first season of Dawson's Creek. A great start to a great series, than ran for 6 seasons. A nice thing about Season One is that in every episode, it begins with Joey (Katie Holmes) and Dawson (James Van Der Beek) watching a movie in his room. They are 15 and have this great friendship, with underlying complexity. This season explores their friendship and feelings for each other. Most of the season Dawson is chasing Jen (Michelle Williams). Dawson's best friend Pacey (Joshua Jackson) also provides a lot of comic relief on the show. Some of my favorite episodes include ""Scare"" where they celebrate Halloween, ""Detention"", where they do a takeoff on ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Beauty Contest"" where Pacey and Joey enter a beauty pageant. Overall a great first season for this show.",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season
461919,"To non-fans of Star Trek,there is the""odd numbered film curse"",which odd numbered Trek film come off as disappointing (finally broken with Star Trek Nemesis).Usually the problem is the filmakers second guessing fan expectation after the sucess of an even numbered film, injecting a bigger budgetThe budget was more than the average box office take of the other films.Overall Insurrection was a better movie than most of the Oddies(except 3).It had some very funny moments,and Patrick Stewart seemed to be having fun as Picard.But one can't help but feel the story would've been better suited on TV.And considering the great quality of DS9 episodes with the Dominion War,you also feel the writers should've strived for more on the big screen.As expected the Box office tally was lower than expected.But in the end,it was a very entertaining film but you feel it could've been better.",Star Trek: Insurrection
744637,"County and The River came out virtually simultaneously.  They have the same theme, farms in crisis.  The main difference is Country is more political in nature.Country is not a true story but is based on a number of true stories.  This film is about a family owned farm that is in trouble.  This trouble was not really their fault.  It was a combination of changing economies and a pullout of government funding. During the 70's, the government threw loans to the farmers, encouraging farmers to overextend themselves.  In the 80's, when crop prices plummeted, the  government foreclosed on the farms.  This made way for large corporate farmers to buy them for pennies on the dollar.Real life husband and wife, Jessica Lange and Sam Sheppard, play the Jewel and Gil Ivey.  They have a farm and government loans.  When they can't make the harvest payment, the bank forecloses on the farm.  Jewel is determined not to lose the farm.This is tour de force performance by Jessica Lange.  Wilford Brimley plays her curmudgeon father and gives a perfectly measured performance.  This would become his signature character that he would be cast as for the remainder of his career.Richard Pearce's direction and William Witliff's screenplay keep the film from getting to preachy or too sentimental.  This is the best film made on the subject of the farm loan crisis.DVD EXTRAS: None",N/A
186248,"The film is stunning -- a reenvisioning of King Lear, but set in the Japanese feudal period.  It may be Kurosawa's most impressive film -- combining the bloody realism of Seven Samurai's war scenes with his keen insight into the establishing of mood through gesture with an incredible eye for color that is displayed in, say, Dreams.The DVD transfer, on both the Fox Lorber and Masterworks edition, is at best passable -- a mere hint of the stunning beauty of the film (I find my VHS copy to be an improvement on both of these).  But there is good news!!! A criterion release is on the way in November!!  With a film like this, where the look is so amazing in the original, it is not worth it to go with a cheap transfer.  Wait for the real thing, or the closest you can get without owning a theater and renting the 35mm print.",N/A
505801,"What a strange little movie that I have avoided watching for years and years.  Finally, I actually sat through it and found a marvelous (though violent) film with very, very good acting and fine scripting.  My family described it as ""brother where art thou"" with violence.  Ernest Borgnine plays a cruel train worker who swears that no hobo will ride his line (it is the Great Depression).  Lee Marvin plays the hobo who does ride his line.  I am not sure who is nemesis and who is protagonist in this film as they battle in box cars, under trains, and on train roofs.  But this film is worth seeing just to see the fine talents performing.  I highly recommend it.",Emperor of the North VHS
595102,"When I first saw this film in 2002, it was and still remains the only movie that has ever truly scared me. Of course, my taste has changed considerably since those days, so I recently decided to revisit the film. Upon rewatching it, I've found myself more impressed than I've ever been with this masterpiece.The story follows Graham Hess (Gibson), a former reverend torn apart by the loss of his wife; his two children Morgan (Culkin) and Bo (Breslin); and his brother, Merrill (Phoenix), a former minor league baseball star. This already stressed out family is put under a considerably heavier trial when they find mysterious patterns in their crops and are then tormented by the following alien invasion of Earth.""Signs"" is the perfect example of the ""less is more"" approach. Director M. Night Shyamalan builds the tension so expertly throughout the film using nothing but silence and clever camera angles that by the time the climax arrives my chest is about to explode. In fact, I have never seen another film that utilizes silence and shadows so well, it's really what makes the film so scary for me. Anytime we see any part of the aliens, it's always so brief or obscured that we're never really sure what it was that we just saw.However, the film does contain some rather illogical flaws, but for the sake of spoilers, I won't go into them. Besides, I, for one, was too immersed in the story to care.Another thing I greatly appreciated in ""Signs"" was James Newton Howard's excellent score. It was not ubiquitous, clich&eacute;, or intrusive like the identical ""original"" scores in all the Hollywood fright films of late. It was there when it should have been and it wasn't when it shouldn't have been.But ""Signs"" is not just a frightening sci-fi film, it is also a film about faith. Graham is a man struggling with his beliefs, which leads to a rather powerful scene toward the end of the film in which he must talk his son through a violent asthma attack while exclaiming ""I hate you!"" at God. Such scenes are also quite demanding from an acting standpoint, and the acting is capably handled by both of the leading men and also by the small band of supporting actors. Oh, this reminds me, keep your eyes open for a cool little cameo by Stella's Michael Showalter.On top of all this, the film also features beautiful, vivid cinematography and genuinely ingenius, fluid camera movements from Shyamalan.I guess ""Signs"" is one of those ""love it or hate it"" films, as I have heard lots of opinions on both sides of the spectrum and not too many in the gray area. As you have probably noticed, I am one of those who love it and I will watch and enjoy this excellent piece of cinema for years to come.9.5/10",Signs

563562,"I have to say, I enjoyed this film very much. I mean, I knew going in that it was going to be a cheesy horror film. Just look at the cover, and you know that. And I was not disappointed. It was fun from the get go with cheesy acting (although the woman who played the main character's wife was very likeable in her role, a much beefier part than in part 1), cheesy dialogue, and tons of gore (at least on the DVD. I hear the VHS is heavily cut).While this is a step down from part 1, in actual film grade and set design, it realizes that from the get go. This one is ten times more self referential than the first one, and also lacks any disturbing scenes (Shannon Elizibeth in the bath tub was one of those scenes in the first one) but still has BUCKETS of gore. I mean, this one has red stuff to spare. And the addition of the little snow ball nasties was a nice touch. They were cute, and very fun to watch. If only they did more CG stuff with them. And on CG, I have to say, the little bit that there was in this movie looked REALLY good for such a cheap budget.",Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman

921649,"Wow, what a great show!  I don't really have anything new to add, but I just bought the DVD set, having never seen a minute of the show, based on the reviews here.  And I'm glad I did, so I thought I'd add to the rave reviews and encourage people to watch this show.I usually hate characters who are wise beyond their years and unrealistically eloquent, firing off witty lines so fast that there's no resemblance to normal human conversation.  (Think Dawson's Creek, Gilmore Girls.)  But in this case, the writing and acting are so good, and the stories are so interesting, that I gladly make an exception.I have to admit that I've only watched the first four episodes, but I watched them all in one sitting and will probably devour the rest of the first season in one weekend.  I'm hooked!",Veronica Mars: Season 1
922814,"This one is a mixed bag; it was intended to be a television pilot -- something we didn't know when we rented it, but figured out pretty quickly. The writing is pretty good, but the cast is what really makes this one: Vincent Perez as the original monster, Thomas Krestchmann as the deranged scientist, Ivana Milicevic as his resurrected wife; and a crew of law enforcement including Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, and Michael Madsen.Think the old TV show ""Beauty and the Beast"" more than ""Van Helsing."" This was directed by the guy who did The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and produced by Martin Scorsese, so you know it's got style for miles. But when I learned that this was loosely based on a book by Dean Koontz, Frankenstein lost a little of its charm -- which isn't fair, I know. I loved ol' Dean when I was a teenager, but I haven't been able to take his books for years. Maybe I owe him another visit, I don't know.For all its flaws (pacing, mostly -- and a tendency to fixate on the wrong details), I really enjoyed this aborted TV show and regretted the fact that it never found a home.  But then I found out that it would have aired on the USA network, and I don't have cable anyway.Ah, well.",Frankenstein 2004 lgf

206306,"Okay, here is definitely a minority view, and you can hate it if you want, but it will not be as much as I hated this movie and its view of life. Cissy Spacek is a divorced woman in her late 30s who is an epileptic with a son who is on his way to becoming a criminal. She is living with her mother (Anne Bancroft) and that night plans on killing herself. Throughout the whole movie Spacek and Bancroft talk about their lives and Spacek's decision as if she were going to the dentist for a root canal. Bancroft rants and raves at times, but that is just a mild interruption to the placid movement of time until the evening when Spacek shoots herself. Spacek has simply come to the conclusion that this is the only course of action open to her, but that decision never comes across as convincing--which makes the whole thing seem like such a waste. Also since it is basically the Marsha Norman play converted to the screen, it is very stagey and visually undramatic. What this movie amounted to for me was nothing more than a moral wasteland.",N/A
634015,"Robots was a movie that I was totally interested in seeing.  I am older but I am a fan of the cartoon movies.  I went with my best friend and aunt and we had a good time.  It was a cute and funny movie.  I will admit I laughed when I think I was suppose to, but, even though it was cute it was lacking something.  I am not sure what is going on with the people who make the cartoon movies but I just left with an okay feeling.  Nothing spectacular to give it 5 stars.  I will also admit I laughed in some parts just because I knew I was suppose to laugh and not actually because it was funny.  I think it is cute for little kids but it has a lot of adult humor that you will have to watch for mixed into the movie.  I personally liked the part where Paul Gimani's character wouldn't let Mcgregor's character into Big Weild's city.  It was funny and I like Mel Brooks character he was cute to actually I liked all the characters but I really was missing some oomph when I left it.  If you have kids or are just a big kid at heart I would suggest you check out this movie...maybe you can find out what is missing for me :).",N/A

437978,"Krakatoa, East of Java is a grand adventure with a fine international cast diving, ballooning, and dodging volcanic eruptions in technicolor.Maximilian Schell (Judgement at Nuremburg, The Black Hole) captains an 1883 expedition hunting treasure in a sunken ship between the islands of the title.  Brian Keith (Family Affair) is along to dive in one of those awesome antique suits, but has not informed the captain of  his worn out lungs and laudenum addiction.  Diane Baker seeks her young son at school on one of the islands.  Rossano Brazzi (South Pacific) and Sal Mineo are a father and son aeronaut team, along to search for the shipwreck from aloft in their ballon, which goes off course and right into the mouth of the nearby island volcano, which erupts - based on historical events - and turns their treasure hunt into a rescue mission.The movie runs slightly over two hours, the first of which is spent, entertainingly,  on character development and so forth.  The second half is well packed with action and special effects.  The final Tsunami scenes are still the best of their kind.  The giant wall of water is scary.Personally I also liked the melodic theme, appropriate for the exotic location and period.  The acting is excellent, and the special effects excellent for 1969, and still hold up today.  The only major flaw is in the title; I believe ""East"" should have been ""West.""  It doesn't matter.",N/A
760754,"The best way to begin is to show you where I stand. I think ""Zombie Island"" and ""The Witch's Ghost"" were excellent. I didn't much care for ""Alien Invasion"" or ""Cyber Chase."" I thought ""The Legend of the Vampire"" was a surprisingly good return to form. Onto chapter six. I can't really say this is one of Scooby's better movies. It kind of lacks the punch and surprises of ""Zombie Island"" and ""The Witch's Ghost."" Instead of the scarey surprises seen in the first two movies, this 6th chapter seems to rely more on silly chases. (But if you like the original episodes, you probably won't mind that so much.) Also, in my opinion, the script is weaker which means the movie seems very long and drawn out. (""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost"" don't seem to have many dull moments at all.) And, I won't say too much here, but when the mystery is uncovered and you really didn't get to know the culprit in the first place, a certain edge is missing. (In ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost,"" we got to know the culprits very well in the 1st half of the movie, and therefore, there was  a scarey sense of recognition when the plots were uncovered. The main reason I can give to watch this movie is that it was at least nice to the original line up from the early cartoons (Casey Kasem-Shaggy, Frank Welker-Fred, Heather North-Daphne, and Nicole Jaffee-Velmah) together again. The movie is worth some interest, but it's more of a long episode. If you like Scooby, this movie is watchable. But, don't expect the terror, intensity, and suspense of ""Zombie Island,"" ""The Witch's Ghost,"" or even ""Legend of the Vampire.""",Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico

It's a personal thing, I believe, and I believe this is a Ring to stand the test of time.Traditional doesn't need to be a bad word, and this Ring resounds with glorious performances from the opening of Das Rheingold through the destruction of Valhalla and the flooding of the Rhine.  It's a glorious, operatic adventure of a lifetime.Some may quibble that Hildegard Behrens isn't a true dramatic soprano, but her fierce will, and often lovely voice, combined with an intensity that is electrifying make this a Brunhilde to treasure.James Morris's Wotan, Christa Ludwig's Fricka, Matti Salminen, and the rest of the cast offer big committed performances under James Levine's baton.

923126,"Alias is an actionpacked drama with everything a person could want in a show.  For the new viewer the season starts with some generic episodes showing how things are done - Alias style.  Sydney (the main character) has had a lot to deal with over the past few years of her life.  But things are finally getting settled - that is, until she finds out a haunting secret about her father.  She finds documents at the end of the previous season that prove that her father, Jack, murdered her mother.  The mystery grows as Sydney uncovers why this happened.  In the beginning of the season Syd deals with her hatred for her father while trying to regrow the relationship.  Also, she quits her job for the CIA to go and work for a secret black-ops division.  She is shocked to discover that she will have to work for Arvin Sloane, a bad guy turned good who murdered her fiance and her best friend.  Syd and her old gang go through the season fighting the bad guys and saving the world.  Don't get me wrong, Alias isn't just some blowout show with costumes and explosions.  It also has relationships between characters that are not only understandable, but realistic.  The most prominent relationship Syd has this season is probably the relationship she is building with her new found sister Nadia. Another relationship is the relationship she is rebuilding with her partner Vaughn. They have always had strong feelings for each other but their relationship was strained over the past year. As the season progresses they gradually go back into the Alias flow and give us some serious stroy and drama.  Twists pop out when you least expect them.  Nothing is ever what it seems.  Alias is a perfect mix of lies, drama, action, romance, and relationship building.  Season Four is the perfect season to start with.  And the cliffhanger will blow your mind.  Go out and give this DVD a try because once you do, you'll be begging to see Season 5.",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

That's the kind of cutting edge guy I am.Yes, these two films are great. 'Return' is my favourite. The first is more horror, the second more played for laughs. Count Yorga is something of a tragic figure, his hubris not only destroying those around him, but also himself. But we're not talking Tolstoy here. This is inspired tosh of the first order. The count is a natty dresser with a nice line in dry sarcasm and aristocratic disdain, although never at the expense of good manners. He is a gentlemen who likes to get to the point quickly. ""Dr Baldwin, you are going to die. You are going to die a most horrible death. You've been a fool, doctor, and now you are to die!"" Yes, he got the point, I would say. Something to do with imminent extinction, perhaps? But the best line belongs to a co-star of his. ""Dr Hayes, what an unexpected surprise"" - ""Yes, so much so that I almost had a massive coronry!""Robert Quarry speculated what a third sequel might have looked like had it seen the light of day (unlike Yorga himself.)

841351,"Like a strange mixture of MARS ATTACKS! and RESIDENT EVIL II, UNDEAD is too silly, smug and disjointed to be enjoyed by the serious horror fan.The first five minutes are the best with a quick character introduction and also getting right into the meteor shower that turns the living humans into flesh eating zombies.  After the zombies show up is when things start getting sillier and sillier.  Example: the main guy is being attacked, in his home, by zombies from the front and the back so he lowers his head then raises his pistols and shoots in two directions at once like he was Christian Bale in EQUILIBRIUM and if that's not bad enough he then jumps in the air, flips upside down, jams his spurs (!?) into the wall above the doorway and literally swings back and forth shooting zombies.If that and lots of CGI effects sounds cool to you then by all means check it out, but I have no desire to ever see it again.",UNDEAD
858607,"I enjoyed this documentary, it does a wonderful job of tracing the history of the Ramones and using interview footage from each member. However, I think the overall flow of the film is a little scatterbrained. There really isn't a clear timeline here.Also, because the movie uses mainly interview footage from Ramones members themselves - and the storyline is a little rough - it is hard for anybody who isn't a Ramones fan to follow along.Overall, this film does a wonderful job of putting into context the importance of the Ramones. No band has influenced rock n roll as much as the Ramones over the past 30 years.

863813,"Relax, and don't expect too much from 'Coronado' and then you can enjoy watching it.  I know, it's a 90-minute mindless fun.  Picture to yourself a low-budget version of 'Romancing the Stone' without Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, and you know what 'Coronado' would be like.  And you find John Rhys-Davies (his role is just a cameo) who appears as President Hugo Luis Ramos, by which you should undersrtand the film does not take itself seriouly at all.Rich and stubborn (but charming) American lady Claire (Kristin Dattilo, TV's 'The Chris Isaak Show') in fancy evening dress goes to a fictional country of Coronado, Central America, in order to find her husband who should be in Europe.  He must be cheating on her, so she believes, but what she found in the hot country turns out a cynical TV reporter Arnet (Clayton Rohner) and big adventures.  (The story reminded me of Paris Hilton in that famous show.)That's it.  Do I have to go on?  There are rebels out in the mountains, who might or might not be helpful to them.  Anyway Claire and Arnet join forces to get what they want -- hubby and scoop -- and there are lots of dangers, mostly enhanced by the CGIs.And the CGIs, considering the budget which I suppose is not high, are decent ones.  Actually they are provided by Volker Engel and Marc Weigert, the German professionals whose CV include the special effects of 'Independence Day.'  The effects of 'Coronado' never reaches the height of the Academy winning Sci-fi film (for visual effects), some of the action scenes are surprisingly thriiling.I have seen this kind of adventure films back in the 80s, and it is a little surprising that they still have power to entertain us.  And, yes, I wanted more original story and less cheesy lines, more chemstry between the leads (though Ms. Dattlio is delightful to see), and most of all more budget, but let's not say it.

I noticed a lot of color changes, being used to my old Black Diamond Classics VHS copy, but I trust Disney with their promise that these were the original colors.  The print looks flawless, crystal clear and I didn't notice any editings done to the movie.  Sound is near-perfect and much, much improved from previous releases.  French and Spanish language tracks are added, unfortunately, the Spanish one seems to be a rather mediocre Mexican re-dubbing which I'm not too content with.Bonus features aren't expectacular, the most horrible one being the ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" music video by the Disney Channel Circle of ""Stars"" (Rather, a bunch of wannabee-cool&popular; common teenagers).  Other bonus features are quite interesting, mainly the behind the scenes featurettes ""A Tribute to Disney's Nine Old Men"" and backstage material.  Theatrical trailers and art galleries are also a nice addition.  A number of added bonuses seem to be too child-friendly for me even if they are rather cute for a one-time viewing.This DVD includes several sneak peeks at other upcoming Disney film releases, the greatest two being the long-awaited Lady and the Tramp (1955) and The Little Mermaid (1989) Platinum 2 Disc Editions coming out February and October of next year.  Some disturbing ones include Cinderella III and Chicken Little (Which looks more horrifying everytime I watch it and that's bad).  Also included is a little metal Cinderella necklace which I'll be giving to one of my school galfriends.Overall, this DVD debut of Walt Disney's Cinderella is highly recommended mainly for the new restored presentation and improved sound quality, bonus features I think you can live without. 4/5",Cinderella Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS
376825,"Orson Welles' 1937 ""Julius Caesar"" is the longest running Broadway production of the play. Welles played Brutus. In 1938, Welles' On-the-Air Mercury Theatre broadcast ""War of the Worlds"". It was a hoax. But it caused a nationwide panic. Listeners were convinced that the Earth was being invaded by Mars. RKO Studios signed Welles to direct ""Citizen Kane"" in 1941. It is regarded by many as the Best Film ever made. Welles had conquered stage, radio, and the cinema. Criterion has just released the flawless, two-disc DVD, ""F For Fake"", an anamorphic, digitally-restored transfer(1.66:1).  Disc One is Welles' 1976 essay/documentary; a non-linear, freeze-frame interview of art forger Elmyr De Hory, culled from 35mm and blown-up 16mm. Elmyr's biographer, Clifford Irving, is later exposed as the fraudulent chronicler of Howard Hughes. ""F For Fake"" features Joseph Cotten, Laurence Harvey, and Welles' mistress, Oja Kodar. Filmed in France, Rome, and southern California, ""F For Fake"" includes shots of Howard Hughes' bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. It was the last film Welles ever directed. Extras include a Peter Bogdanovich introduction, a nine-minute trailer(curiously un-restored), and a commentary track. Disc Two contains the elusive 88-minute documentary, ""One-Man Band"". It has never been available before on film, video, or DVD( I saw it once 2 years ago on late-night cable). The 1995 ""One-Man Band"" examines Welles' lost/unfinished movies. This treasure trove includes scenes from ""The Other Side of the Wind"", ""The Deep"", and, reportedly, his mysterious ""Don Quixote(A work in progress, on-and-off, for 15 years)"". Welles stares into the camera, pauses, and recites Herman Melville in fragments of his ""Moby Dick"". He is electrifying. The process is staggering; and finally heart-breaking. So much talent, and finally, a sense of loss. Disc Two has another stunning documentary, an essay, a 60 Minutes excerpt, and a Howard Hughes press conference. Director, actor, writer, painter, magician. Orson Welles was, perhaps, the greatest auteur of the 20th Century. Big words. Big man. Big cigar. Welles once said that we are all really 2 or 3 different people inside. Or none of these at all. Was Orson Welles a fake?  Welles' classic 1958 ""Touch of Evil"" ended in these last lines:  Tanya: Isn't somebody gonna come and take him away?  Schwartz: Yeah, in just a few minutes. You really liked him, didn't you?  Tanya: The cop did..the one who killed him...he loved him.  Schwartz:  Is that all you have to say for him?  Tanya:  He was some kind of a man...What does it matter what you say about people?",F for Fake VHS

Jaglom accepts the idea of ""soul mate"" as a premise, indulges in a little mysticism, effectively utilizes an old standard (The White Cliffs of Dover) dripping with nostalgia, and in the process delivers a film that will be revered by those who are believers and reviled by those who remain skeptics. ""Paris? How cliche!"" or ""Paris because it had to be!""  Dana and Sean are soulmates but Dana is engaged to Alex and Sean married to Claire. Both relationships could be described as happily content,  but once Dana and Sean discover each other, being content suddenly seems empty. And so they are confronted with a dilemma: seize the day or turn away. In the film Citizen Kane, a reporter searching for the significance of ""Rosebud"" to a man that had everything is told thus: ""One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since, that I haven't thought of that girl.""

944798,"If you're reading this review and have checked out the DVD details you no doubtedly know who Eric Johnson is and know that he is simply the most amazing guitarist living or dead.Good news and bad news about this instructional video.  Good news: this is the entire VHS copy (with an awesome transfer of video and audio) plus they broke out the lessons in normal and 1/2 speed which you can set (with the DVD menus) to repeat over and over until you figure it out and play it smoothly.  Eric also does a great job explaining in detail what he wants to teach you while showing it.Bad news: after attempting to play what Eric Johnson plays so effortlessly you may soon realize that you're not as good as you once thought you were!  May make you want to quit and take up something like origami.  Or, this DVD could make you want to practice twice as much and pick up the signature Eric Johnson Strat and try to achieve his clean, pure tone and playing style.This DVD will show you his playing styles, how he gets his tone, lots of lessons on many styles of playing, we get to watch and listen to a couple of complete original songs (not found anywhere else), and watch Eric show lots of techniques he used on Ah Via Musicom (which hadn't been released when the tape was made) and Tones.Eric is simply friggin' amazing and for the first time, you get to sit with him and have him explain the stuff that makes him unique.  I highly suggest it to people who want to improve at playing guitar (all styles) as well as Eric Johnson fans who just appreciate his ability and want to see him in a private setting with just him solo with he strat.Every time I see Eric Johnson play, I realize how much I have yet to learn.  I wouldn't be surprised if he comes out with an instructional piano video as well after seeing his live acoustic tour a couple years ago.Thanks Eric...  you are amazing.

309222,"Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck play interestingly against type as psychologically troubled artist Gerry Carroll and his fragile second wife, Sally.  The problem isn't the acting or (in my opinion) the casting, but the clunky script.  In the opening scene, Sally accidentally learns that new flame Gerry is married when (*clears throat for comic effect*) a letter to ""Mrs. Carroll"" falls out of his pocket.  Swearing to never see Gerry again, Sally runs off into the rain, only to turn up married to Gerry three scenes later, after wife number one is dead.  From there, the turns of plot become ever more convenient and clich&eacute;d, and yet somehow less logical at the same time.  The script both swills in extraneous information and leaves too much unexplained, and the film overall is like a clothesline, with the plot points hung on awkwardly at predictable intervals.But if there were ever two stars that could save bad material, it was Bogart and Stanwyck.  Bogie made the choppy, incoherent character Gerry come out to more than the sum of his parts.  And Stany, rest her soul, did her best in everything, from Preston Sturges literary tour de force *The Lady Eve* to the string of nickel westerns she did in the '50s.  This pairing deserved a better vehicle, but it's fun to watch even so.",N/A
506472,"Shooting at just under two hours, this is one of those films where you nearly feel winded after watching it in its entirety.  Not that it is a ""bad"" thing to have so much happening in just a short amount of time, but with Grace of My Heart it felt like a solid blow to the gut.  The lack of air, the ""whoosh"" of intense pain, and the increased blurred vision due to the excitement of the punch were all experiences that I had while watching this film.  For those that can sit here and claim that this was a perfect film, I really beg to differ, but I will be a very brave advocate towards the ""originally average"".  This means that there were elements that I completely loved, followed in suit by elements that made me awaken at night in a pool of my own sweat.  Grace of My Heart was one of those classic cinematic tug-o-wars that ultimately ended in a stalemate, but had fans on either side waiting for the final results.Beyond the cryptic comparisons that I make above, there were moments of honesty, especially when I was thinking about the elements that worked and those that did not.  You cannot talk about this film without giving Anders the credit that she deserves for the music.  This film could not have survived without the talent that was behind the musical moments.  The energy, emotion, and cultural independence were ravishing.  Literally, it could take your breath away and you wouldn't have even realized it.  It set the tone and created the atmosphere for this film.  As a viewer, you could close your eyes, ignore the spoken words of this film, and get completely lost in the music.  The way that Anders incorporated established, modern singers to bring this era of the 50s, 60s, and 70s to life were brilliant.  She deserved the accolades that followed the musical footsteps of this film, sadly ... I don't think she quite had a firm grip on the rest of the story.What I mean by this is that while the songs established the film, the story and characters hurt it. Illeana Douglas does exceptionally well with the material presented to her, but she just doesn't quite drag you into her life.  You never quite feel as if you are right there with her experiencing her sorrows, excitements, and pain as she trudges through this man-infested life of hers.  You watch her go through the motions, but you never feel that tear erupt or couch-excitement brew.  It just doesn't happen, and why ... because 1) she never ages throughout the course of 20ish years (only gets thinner and thinner) 2) her voice is semi-whiney through the entire film causing us to feel like she was a bit sour and finally, 3) her consistent need for a man in her life.  This latter I blame Anders.  She never defines Waverly's character throughout the film.  Is she a feminist?  Is she as independent as we all thought?  Does she create or simply steal from other's misfortunes?  These are simple questions that should have been answered throughout the film, but instead we are nearly forced to explode (as stated before) as more and more information is jammed down our vision.  It is nearly sickening.  While Illeana doesn't carry the weight of disaster completely on her own shoulders, there are other characters that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film.  Bruce Davison and Matt Dillon seemed to be completely miscast in their respective roles, again constantly reminding us that we were watching a film, not immersing ourselves in a vivid story.The only character that I can give credit towards is John Turturro's Joel Millner.  Turturro took his ""bit"" part to a new level always giving enough so that we constantly waited for him to reappear on screen.  He was like an animated cartoon that brought more to the screen than any of the other characters mentioned above.  That is sad to see for a film of this caliber, but it is what occurred.  So, you take the grandiose excitement of the music and couple it with some sub-par acting and what do you get?  Grace of My Heart in its purest form.Overall, it is never good to use more than one Fonda in your film.  If you find yourself going with more than one, you should really be reconsidering your options.  Matt Dillon completely ruined this film for me, while my keen eye had a blast picking out today's artists in this film.  I just wish more was developed with Douglas' character.  Why did she continually fall into love with the wrong men?  Did anyone else catch that her creative songs were developed from the suffering of others?  Finally, why did we bring up her family's fortune if it was never used throughout the film?  I kept waiting for her to use her family money to build upon the climax of the film, but it never happened.  I felt cheated, as I did several times during this film.  It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it just wouldn't stand out in a crowd.  Grace of My Heart is the wallflower of the cinematic world.Grade: ** out of *****",Grace of My Heart
932083,"This movie is by far the best film I've ever seen.  Hands down.  It shows the pure human emotion that will make you stand up and cheer at the end, not just because theres an amazing triumph, but because of WHO you are watching triumph.  Crowe at his best to date stars as Braddock, a man who was once at his best and then, due to arthritis and we can't forget the depression falls flat on his face, working day jobs here and there where he can and fighting nameless fights when given the chance all just to provide for his family.  It's heart wrenching to watch Crowe give his breakfast to his hungrey daughter or to watch him beg for money from the boxing comm. with his hat in his hands.  Crowes performance is so intence and so real that it took me a bit to realize I was watching a movie.  I was actually brought to tears for Crowe and not Braddock.  As fate would have it Braddock is given a chance at redemption and he takes it...winning fight after fight until he goes up against Max Baer for the title.  The last scene is so intence, and even though we all know how it ends we can't help but cringe thinking somehting bad may happen.  This is by far the best boxing/family drama I've ever scene.

161514,"Clark Gabel and Claudette Colbert won oscars for their portrayals of a couple brought togther on a bus. A young society girl (Colbert) attempts to flee from her contolling father and is assisted by a newspaper reporter (Gabel). Additionally, the movie won the best picture award. I believe this was the first clean sweep in the history of the academy awards. In this well made romantic comedy, Colbert, although a spoiled society girl, has spunk in getting away from her father and she shows lots of charm. There have been many romatic comedies filmed since (and Meg Ryan seems to be in half of them). If these latest efforts seem to rely on a formula, it's because ""It Happened One Night"" set the standard for the others to follow.If you are very observant, you will see a very familiar face in the movie. There is the famous hitch hiking scene in which Colbert shows Gabel how to stop a car. When they get picked up, the driver who stops for them looks so darn familiar. If you look long enough you would exclaim, ""I know who that is, it's the skipper in Gilligan's Island!"" Well, you would be wrong since this movie is about three decades before Alan Hale Jr. portrayed that role. You get three guesses who it was driving the car ... one ... two ... three. OK, the answer is that the driver is portrayed by Alan Hale Sr. That's right, father and son are absolute dead ringers for each other in appearance, mannerisms and the way they talk.This oscar winning movie is an absolute delight.

Several times I found myself wondering how they timed things so neatly.Silver does a great job of pointing out the thousand details that make the movie work as a movie, the turns of plot that are typical of film noir, the use of darkness and shadow, the framing of scenes and placement of the actors, etc., etc.Other reviewers have put in their vote for the quality of Thieves' Highway as a compelling and well made movie.

As a loyal fan of Douglas Adams for more than a quarter of a century, I was appalled and horrified by this incredibly unfaithful and singularly unfunny adaptation of his masterful work.  Maybe if you've never even heard of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or the ingenious Douglas Adams, you might accidentally enjoy one or two seconds of this putrid cinematic mess (doubtful, but possible), but I don't see how any Adams fan can watch this thing without standing up and shaking his/her fist at the screen and muttering various unmentionable words throughout the entire hour and forty minutes.  I mean, this film is absolutely horrible.  I don't even consider it an actual adaptation of Adams' story because half of this movie is original, badly written material - and the other half is a sloppy mish-mash of Adams' vision.  I had my doubts that I would like this film, which is why I waited so long to watch it, but never did I imagine that I would hate it with every fiber of my being.This feature film never made it to development during Adams' life.  There's a reason for that: Adams wasn't going to let his definitive story be ruined by a bunch of writers who thought they knew more about Adams' vision than he did.  Adams' death allowed these script butchers to go ahead and sacrifice Adams' legacy at the altar of their own profit.  These guys took the funniest novel ever written and transformed it into a film without one remotely funny moment.  They got every character completely wrong.  What's this folderol about Trillian actually falling for Arthur?  And Zaphod's second head (and ridiculously fake third arm) - horrible, horrible, horrible.  And why the heck does Zaphod look like Tom Cruise and talk like Bill Clinton doing an Elvis impersonation?  Ford basically disappears halfway into the film.  And Marvin - I had hopes for Marvin (my favorite character) because Alan Rickman would be supplying the voice - those hopes were dashed to pieces.  Even the Hitchhiker's Guide graphics were abysmal - downright cartoonish, even when compared to the low-budget visuals of the classic BBC Hitchhiker's production (which, by the way, is actually faithful to the story and - more importantly -funny).I could go on forever about how terrible an adaptation of Adams' ingenious work this movie is.  This cinematic travesty will likely drive away a lot of people who will now never go near an actual Douglas Adams novel, as they will likely expect each one of them to contain the same kind of hopeless drivel that is this movie.

What are they afraid of, aren't they already cursed?Then there is the flaw of the werewolf that made them wanting to destroy them? Why did he turn them to werewolves in the first place if he just wanted to kill them? Didn't he make killing them harder by turning them into something supernatual? He could have just killed them in the beginning.Also, Craven strays from the werewolf legend by making the werewolves retain their control and ability to reason when morphed into full werewolf.

886473,"""Malice Aforethought"" is a wry mystery based on the 1931 novel by Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox). This novel is widely considered the mystery writer's best work, but it is unlike conventional mysteries in that we know who commits the murder and why. We are privy to the murderer's plan, and we watch the darkly comic consequences play out.In the small English town of Wyvern's Cross, lover's trysts and hypochondriacs occupy most of Doctor Edmund Bickleigh's (Ben Miller) time. Dr. Bickleigh's constantly critical, domineering wife Julia (Barbara Flynn) owns the couple's home and never allows her husband to forget that for a moment. He's carrying on an affair with an adoring young lady named Ivy (Lucy Brown). But when the airheaded, artistic Miss Madeleine Cranmere (Megan Dodds) takes up residence in town, Dr. Bickleigh becomes infatuated with her. The socially conscious Julia has forbidden Bickleigh from ever seeing Madeleine, though. And Madeleine is not forthcoming with her affections without a promise of marriage. So Dr. Bickleigh decides that murder is the solution. But that's just the beginning of his troubles.""Malice Aforethought"" is black comedy revolving around the sociopathic, self-absorbed, but laughably foolish Dr. Bickleigh. Those traits actually don't distinguish him from most of the townsfolk. The film's characters could be as tiresome to the audience as they are to one another if we didn't see everyone through Dr. Bickleigh's eyes. Ben Miller gives a stand-out performance as this man who is oblivious to ethics and entirely single-minded. But instead of belonging to someone shrewd and ambitious, these traits belong to a dull-witted, passive-aggressive country doctor -who earnestly applies them to his problems. Thus ""Malice Aforethought""'s mocking, ironic humor.",N/A

That doesn't mean I didn't sneak home after school and watch when no one was looking...Seeing all the characters come alive in this very hokey teenage melodrama filled with bad jokes and comedy still makes me laugh. The twins do a great job of reprising the roles of Elizabeth and Jessica, but how people could get them mixed up is beyond me! In the first minute of the show, we see Elizabeth dressed very preppy and cute, while her slutty sister dresses like an MTV model. It cracks me up seeing the terrible actors approach the girls pretending to get them mixed up. Its obvious: Jessica is the wanna-be prostitue, while Elizabeth is a prude.Not that this show doesn't have other good qualitites, such as bad 90's music and bad haircuts for the boys. Elizabeth's boyfriend is a stick who is dumb as a brick, but kinda cute in the 90's preppy boy way...Seriously, this show makes me laugh, and I really enjoy the campy drama and overacting, especially on the part of Lila and Winston, who follow exactly Franscine Pascal's book characters.If you expect a better 90210, look elsewhere, but if you want 90's teenage drama, go for this series and read the books!",Sweet Valley High: Season 1

Their kiss is one of the best Hollywood has ever offered & as a result it would have been cut (or at least shortened, it was long). Also cut would have been some of Harlow's smart banter &  state of undress. In one scene she is reclining alone & stretching, her high thigh dress going north.

934242,"Inspired by the actual Earth-centered religion of Wicca, many television viewers in 1998 became enchanted with the fictional story of three extraordinary sisters who, after their grandmother's death, discover that they are witches and that each has a unique magical power.  The oldest, Prudence ""Prue"" Halliwell (Shannen Doherty), discovers that she has a magical ""punch"" with which she can physically force anyone (or anything) to be thrown away from her.  The middle sister, Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs), discovers that she can magically freeze anyone or anything.  The youngest sister, Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano), discovers that she has a magical gift of foresight that allows her to see potentially disastrous future events for individuals if she touches an object that has been handled by them.  As it turns out, the sisters' mother, Patty Halliwell (regular guest Finola Hughes), and their grandmother, Penny 'Grams' Halliwell (regular guest Jennifer Rhodes), were also witches.  Hidden within their San Francisco house attic is their famed Book of Shadows (book of spells and information about various paranormal beings, such as demons and white lighters).  The sisters also discover that they are unique among witches in that they possess the very powerful ability to invoke the ""power of three"", which is a very powerful incantation that can be used to destroy demons and other evil beings.  In fact, that is their mission: to protect the world from the evil attacks of various demons, warlocks and other evil beings.  Of course, these newly discovered abilities and frequent attacks from demons wreak havoc for the sisters' lives, especially their careers and attempts at dating.  However, the sisters also discover that they are not alone in their efforts as they are frequently visited by the ghosts of their mother and grandmother, and that the equivalent of a guardian angel known as a ""white lighter"", Leo Watts (Brian Krause), not only provides them with important information and assistance, he can also heal them of their wounds.  The sisters are also visited occasionally by their estranged father, Victor Bennett (regular guest James Read); and because the sisters are so frequently involved with seemingly criminal activities, they become friends with local police officer Darryl Morris (Dorian Gregory).The third season marked two major changes in the series.  First, a new main character enters the lives of the sisters: the Assistant District Attorney Cole Turner (Julian McMahon).  Being very handsome and sophisticated, it isn't long before one of the sisters, Phoebe, becomes quite attracted to him.  However, Cole is not exactly what he seems: he's actually a powerful demon named Belthazor who was sent by the Source (the leader of the demons) to destroy the Halliwell sisters; but his human side unexpectedly begins to fall for Phoebe.  What will the sisters do when they discover Cole's true identity?  Will Cole destroy the sisters, including the one whom he's falling in love?  Also, how can the sisters find a way for Piper and Leo to get married, which is strictly forbidden because he's a whitelighter?The answers are contained within the third season's 22 episodes that aired between 2000 and 2001.  They include ""The Honeymoon's Over"", ""Magic Hour"", ""Once Upon a Time"", ""All Halliwell's Eve"", ""Sight Unseen"", ""Primrose Empath"", ""Power Outage"", ""Sleuthing With the Enemy"", ""Coyote Piper"", ""We All Scream for Ice Cream"", ""Blinded by the Whitelighter"", ""Wrestling with Demons"", ""Bride and Gloom"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Cursed"", ""Just Harried"", ""Death Takes a Halliwell"", ""Pre-Witched"", ""Sin Francisco"", ""The Demon Who Came In from the Cold"", ""Exit Strategy"", ""Look Who's Barking"" and ""All Hell Breaks Loose"".With engaging characters, wonderful scripts, exciting plots and great special effects, I rate the very exciting third season of ""Charmed"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Though Shannen Doherty left ""Charmed"" after this third season in the season finale ""All Hell Breaks Loose"", all is not lost as is revealed in the fourth season with the discovery of a previously unknown sister named Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan).",Charmed : The Complete Third Season

632365,"It begins and ends with the deaths of key persons in the life of oceanographer Steve Zissou, a sort of underfunded Jacques Cousteau. His career needs the boost it gets when a young man who actually is his son joins a voyage of vengeance (think ""Jaws"" or ""Moby Dick""). They set out to kill the shark that ate his partner at the beginning. Father and son fall for an unmarried pregnant reporter also on board (don't ask). There is a shipboard kidnapping and deadly shoot-outs on board and on a deserted island. This is a comedy. No kidding.Yes, we are sailing in waters in which the imaginative director. Wes Anderson, has charted a course badly in need of a compass. It is the weakest of his films (""Rushmore,"" ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."") In it we await the moment when all the entertaining bits and pieces come together in a satisfying way, only to have it end before that moment arrives. That we are willing to stay with it testifies to the sly charm of those bits and pieces and Anderson's skill with them.In the title role, the reliable Bill Murray tries so hard to appear not to be acting that he actually doesn't. That leaves a hole in the movie that the other actors, most of whom like Murray have worked with Anderson before, are unable to fill. Cate Blanchett, Owen Wilson, Angelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, Bud Cort, how can you go wrong with a cast like that? Apparently, you can. Even when your movie is given a two-disc DVD transfer by the standard-setting Criterion Collection.""The Life Acquatic With Steve Zissou"" boasts a city block-long cutaway of the ship ""Belafonte"" (a wink at Cousteau's ship ""Calypso."") There is some clever animation, and original songs by David Bowie are sung in Portugese throughout. But these flourishes are not enough to invigorate the humor or quicken the pace. Anderson is a true auteur, a treasure really, who writes and directs his own ideas instead of adapting other work to the screen. Given his excellent track record, we can cut him some slack on this one.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
261454,"While Disney set the standard for Treasure Island by which all other versions are judged, TNT's take on the classic R.L. Stevenson tale is by far the best.

906053,"I'm so glad they are going to release this as my tapes of the third season are mostly worn out. We also get more episodes (20) as compared to just 16 in season 2. The boys in Tour Of Duty also steer away from most of the soap opera style episodes and the focus is now more on combat and the soldiers realizations of the futility of the Vietnam war. Some of my favorite episodes of the series were in this season especially when Carl Weathers-from the Rocky movies joins the cast and as a special forces Col. His character and acting are superb and add so much to the series. Lee Majors also joins for a few episodes as an old soldier in his third war.Whether Tour Of Duty has real music from the 60's or the same old tired tracks we have heard throughout the series is irrelevant.  Sure it WOULD be nice to hear those songs, but it seriously doesn't ruin the whole experience. If I want to hear 60's music I can always pop a cd in my stereo and listen. I bought the other two DVD sets to experience the best war series ever, not music.To me the content of these episodes makes this the second best season. Each soldier's tour comes full circle and for better or worse they all have to deal with the problems of overstress from war, recovery the horrors they have seen, and come to grips with their part in it all whether good or bad. The series could not be complete without the closure that is given to topics that have been nagging the soldiers throughout their tours.I doubt after watching all 20 of these episodes anyone who has complained about the music will still be complaining because of the gripping content of each episode.",N/A
268098,"HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE is one of the finest films in Bette Davis' long career, although it didn't quite get the full praise it deserved coming on the heels of WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE and the slew of gothic thrillers starring aging movie queens in the 1960's that followed.  Yet this is a engrossing, ultimately moving story of a child-like woman whose life has been ruined by a murder she may have or may not have committed.  Bette gives an Oscar calibre performance as the high-strung Charlotte and she is matched by Olivia DeHavilland, superbly cool and calm but is she the daughter of Melanie Wilkes or her evil twin?

From every move (down to that Ray Charles swagger), to ever word, to every note sung and played on that piano, there's no doubt about it...he IS Ray Charles.I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I was rather disappointed in the plot or story of this movie.  It centers around Ray's heroin addiction and adulterous behavior more than the music.  Maybe that's just me.

Being from Ohio and knowing lots of folks who played music in its bars, I was hoping for far more than what I found in LIGHT OF DAY.The biggest problem I had was casting: Michael J. Fox, looking to shed his Marty McFly and Alex Keaton image, never convinces me that he's a hard-rocking bar buster from Cleveland.  I always thought Keifer Sutherland could've pulled it off better.But I love Joan Jett in this movie.  I believe every frame of her performance.  The scene where she explains to Fox why she's into music (while ridiculing the posers frying out on drugs nearby) is great.I thought the identity of the father of her child was a cop-out and detracted from the drama of the final scenes.LIGHT OF DAY is still a cool 80's movie.

354783,"`The Purple Rose of Cairo', written and directed by Woody Allen, is one of those rare movies which is so strongly and imaginatively crafted that it is almost painful to watch a second or third time. While it is certainly not Allen's best, it almost seems like Allen, his actors, and his crew almost flawlessly craft it. Even the fact that Allen does not appear in the film seems to heighten its quality.While movies (or fiction) in movies play a big role in many of Allen's films such as `Play it again, Sam', `Stardust Memories', and `Deconstructing Harry', this film is unlike those, most especially since this one is not at all biographical. It is most similar to `Zelig' in that the primary premise of the plot has something of a sci-fi twist to it. In addition to the foreground story of the principle characters played by Mia Farrow, Jeff Daniels, and Danny Aiello, there is the comic relief provided by the actors on the screen in the New Jersey theatre who are free to ad lib their time on the screen, since they cannot follow through with the plot with one of the main characters out roaming the streets of New Jersey. One has to thank Allen for this, as without the relief of the figures coming alive on the screen, the movie would be almost unbearably sad.As Allen's movies are typically done on a small budget and he has a great reputation for bringing projects in on time and within budget, it is a little surprising to see the quality of the filming in this movie. Of course, since the whole premise is based on the contrast between the fictional film and the `real' film, much effort was put into the quality of both. The quality of the `film within a film' is especially well done, as the characters really look like they are from an early 1930's film, except for the very recognizable Edward Herrmann.And, the acting in the `real' film is even better, as the `fictional' film acting is just a bit over the top. Daniels and Aiello are especially strong throughout the film. Farrow seems just a little too much like her usual `Rosemary's Baby' mousy character until the final scene when she shows a transformation on her face over the course of about two minutes which is so subtle, you may miss it if you were not expecting it. Since you do look for it, the incredibly slow but obvious transformation from sadness to engagement in the Fred Astaire / Ginger Rodgers movie is a tour de force.This may be one of Allen's most philosophically deep films, which enhances the film's interest without weighing it down so that you can no longer appreciate the story. I can attest to the deep philosophical content with the fact that when I was young, I wondered whether I was `real' or only part of a movie. And, this was at least 25 years before the release of `The Purple Rose of Cairo'. This puzzle led me to take up the study of philosophy in college.None of Allen's films have any director's commentary, but this is one where I would be most interested in hearing where Allen got some of his inspiration. Then again, there is very little here which is entirely new. Allen is giving us a new treatment of many of his usual themes using many of his usual devices. But, as usual, every time Allen throws all these ingredients into to the mix for a new movie, he seems to come up with a new and engrossing way to bring them all together.Surprisingly, for a film with a fantasy premise, this work has a lot less humor than the very realistic movies such as `Crimes and Misdemeanors' and `Hannah and Her Sisters'. For that reason, it may be less enjoyable to own, but I think it is easily among the upper half of Allen's films in overall quality.",N/A
391413,"The premise for ""The Prophecy"" is based on a supposed 23rd chapter of Revelation being discovered that chronicles a new war beginning in Heaven, but this time war is not brought on by wanting God's power but jealousy over human's being given God's unwavering love and grace.The angel leading the new war in Heaven is Gabriel, played amazingly by Christopher Walken.  When the movie begins there has been a stalemate in the war between the angels loyal to God and those wanting humans to be barred access to Heaven.  Gabriel's angels determine that the key to winning this war and closing Heaven to the humans forever is by finding the most evil soul on Earth, a soul that belonged to a general that has just passed away and now the hunt is on to see which side will reach the soul first.Standing in Gabriel's way is the angel Simon, an angel still loyal to God, who has found the soul and is hiding it inside a little indian girl.  Assisting Simon is a former would-be priest turned athiest cop, who begins to understand that if Gabriel is not stopped and the gates of Heaven do not reopen to the humans, there will be Hell on Earth.This movie is well done and deals with some very fun ideas about angels and humans.  Granted it's not the most theologically sound movie, in fact it's far from it; however, inaccurate the movie may be it isn't blasphemous either in my opinion.  Not a movie to form your opinions of Christianity upon, but still a fun sci-fi, religious thriller that raises some good points and shows a great journey for the athiest cop to come back to his faith.Also, look for a brief appearance by Satan (played by a pre-Lord of the Rings, Viggo Mortensen) that is very well done, in which he shows Gabriel the error of his ways, by instructing him that this new war is steeped in jealousy, and jealousy is evil which makes Gabriel no better than Satan.  Satan's reason for interfering in the war to help humans because though he doesn't care one ounce about us, he doesn't like that due to Heaven being blocked it could create another Hell and that's one to many in his mind, so he acts more out of self-preservation than anything else.""The Prophecy"" is rated R, for violence and some language.

I have to say, the art was breath taking... the story was a bit confusing, but even for a general final fantasy fan with no experience in playing FF7, this movie is absolutely amazing... if that's you and you're a reasonably intelligent open minded person then this review is for you.I realize that many people would like a movie which is clear from beginning to end. You weren't going to get that with this - the movie is target only to individuals through gaming circles, likewise the true target audience was people who have already played the FF7 game (whereas Spirits Within for instance was for just about anyone and was marketed as a major motion picture).Keeping that in mind there's no reason to complain about the lack of explanation in the movie. Certainly one could wish there was more but it isn't necessary, take the film for what it is and if you still don't like it then write a descriptive review of what exactly you didn't like. I've seen a number of quality independent films and films that were marketed in a similar way and so I didn't mind the lack of clarity. There's only so much you could explain in a movie about characters with such a heavy back story while still remaining in the realm of entertaining.The bulk of the story is complicated to follow as past reviewers have noted because the movie works on an emotional level to flesh out Cloud's character and bring to light things that were still haunting him from the time of the game *and* prior to that (the game's back story, if you will). Many things are not clearly stated in the movie such as the past relationship between Sephiroth and Cloud and how Sephiroth often uses Cloud's tormenting memories as a way to weaken him (this for instance is illustrated in one of the last segments in the movie where Sephiroth says, ""I will not remain just a memory"" - threatening Cloud, reminding him that he has the Jenova Cells in him as well). On an emotional level without ever playing the game the plot itself is a 4/5 depending on whether or not you can supplement what you've watched with outside reference material.How do you figure out the back story once you've seen the movie or prior to seeing the movie? Online encyclopedias if you haven't played Final Fantasy 7. Tedious? Not at all, the movie makes such research worthwhile for people who haven't played the game but are interested in fleshing out their knowledge of the events and relationships that made themselves apparent in the film. Why would you watch a movie that you'll have to look up information for later? Because the characters are so lovable they are worth it - they'll make you want to play the game if you haven't, and the emotional ties solidified in this movie - I assure you - will strengthen as you see Cloud and his friends suffer in the game (as cruel as that sounds).Familiar with digital animation, I should point out once more than this film doesn't just have spectacular graphics it *has* cutting edge graphics which should be praised and awarded. The movie simply isn't that much money for what it is, and for what it is it can easily become one of the best anime's you've seen to date (especially if you supplement your viewing experience with some background information if you don't have it already, and if you do then keep an open mind about the film).And the music? Forget about it... perfect! Hard rock/industrial sort mixed with some Final Fantasy-favorite tunes, and some other lovely songs. Great with the fast paced action (negative reviews about action being too fast paced? Grow up, unless of course you think it interferes with the cohesiveness of the film).I can only hope that you - the reader - can enjoy and appreciate this film as much as I have. I realize that many people have negative views about films based on the fact that it has been hyped up in gaming circles and that they've been anticipating it for a while (this happens whenever you mix diehard fans with a new movie featuring the characters they love in it), but keep an open mind and you'll love it.",N/A
911003,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a relationship with someone of a different race? Better yet, have you imagined what would happen when you introduced your significant other to your parents? This is the backdrop for this movie, a comedy with some funny moments mixed together with a script that is mostly predictable.This movie is similar to the 1967 classic, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and many viewers who enjoyed that movie will want to compare this movie to it. In ""Guess Who"", the same situation is presented, except this time a black woman played by actress Zoe Saldana is bringing home a white man, played by Ashton Kutcher, to meet her parents. Tensions are felt all around, but the person who is most uneasy is Percy Jones, played by actor Bernie Mac. He claims that it doesn't bother him, but he continues to look for ways to break his daughter and her fianc&eacute; up, even though he has always told his kids that they should be color blind and accepting of all people.While Bernie Mack is struggling with his acceptance of his daughter's new boyfriend, he is also trying to plan a party where he and his wife (played by Judith Scott) will renew their wedding vows. Toward the end of the film, his wife gets upset at him and it looks like the party is off. Now, it is up to him to apologize and win back his wife's affections. It is here, at this point, that he realizes how much his wife means to him and how much his daughter means to her boyfriend. This subplot is, again, mostly predictable. But it at least fits into the movie's theme and keeps the movie flowing.Bernie Mack, Zoe Saldana, and Judith Scott are all pretty good in this film and they have a good grip on their respective roles and the personification of their characters. My only reservations are with Ashton Kutcher, who plays the role of Simon Green. His performance seems a little off the mark and the chemistry between him and Zoe Saldana wasn't quite there. Saldana throws her heart into the role, but Kutcher seems like he doesn't rally want to be here.Overall, this film is a good one and it does have some good comedic moments. Its greatest flaws are its predictability and formula- driven script. But I liked it enough to recommend. Bernie Mac's comedic talent alone is worth giving this movie a watch.",N/A

621363,"Spider-Man 2 is better than most other superhero movies you have seen, not because the comic and hero makers are still alive to help carry Hollywood through those taxing story hurdles, but because director Sam Raimi is at the helm, period. If Spider-Man 2 suffers from anything, then obviously it is a restricted budget (seen in the budget CGI effects of the first outing) because Raimi was a relatively unknown director with only a big list of unknown films (Evil Dead movies) behind him. If anything blame the studios for throwing an extra 30 million in the direction of 10 Direct to DVD moves you never watched last year.Spider-Man 2 takes off from where the first one almost left off, Mary Jane is still the love Peter Parker can not have, the new Green Goblin/ Hobgoblin is in the making, Aunt May copes with the loose of her husband and we learn some new things about her life and where it is going, Dr. Octavius is in town for a science class and more of The Daily Bugle means Spider-Man 2 is almost like watching a re-run of the first, with the side story that when Parker becomes depressed he looses he powers. Thus when the bad guys start winning more, Parker starts to loose his powers more. It is a very good new character development in Spider-Man's abilities to fight crime.I quite like the character of Dr. Octopus. What Raimi does with his character towards the end is very interesting. Most Superhero movies are about bad vs good. Here Raimi does fallen good guys vs mutant good guys. The CGI effects in this opus are a notch up or two from the last one. It is just such a shame that Spider-Man is not getting the credit that the studio should have given it from the start.",Spider-Man 2
750630,"Considering the very short pre-production period, and the enormous pressure that the filmmakers must have been feeling after the surprise hit of `Saw', it must be said that `Saw II' did a very good job. The script of the sequel, which was originally written as a thriller unrelated to `Saw,' surely borrows many elements from other films including `Saw' (yes of course), but still is effective as suspense with much gore, largely due to its better editing and sound effects.[ONE THING] you must do before watching `Saw II' is to see the original, in which one serial killer Jigsaw spears. It is very important for some characters re-appear in the sequel, and they play a considerably significant role in `Saw II.' And it would be a good test for you - if you find the original too violent and gory, you don't have to see the sequel, which is equally violent and gory.The sequel again shows the characters trapped in an old dirty room - this time eight persons - for the reasons only Jigsaw knows. These elaborate tricks are set up by the same Jigsaw, who again keeps on watching these confined characters through some media, but this sequel has a nice additional touch. For the two police detectives (Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer) are allowed to share the same experience as audience in the way I should not reveal.But the escape from the deadly house wholly depends on the actions of the trapped people, All the lethal traps or props are prepared in the most sinister (or nasty) way you can think of. Still, if you have seen the films of this genre, it is not difficult to anticipate what is coming next. At least you can sense something is there, even though admittedly some of the scenes involving these tricks always looks painful, or are really scare-inducing at times.However, as some viewers have said perhaps too rightly about the improbability of `Saw II' and its story, these characters often behave in the most stupid way, and the script is full of plot holes. Why don't they realize the importance of the hints Jigsaw gave right before them?  Why do they do unnecessary things like you know what? But booby traps are called booby traps because they don't catch wise people, so let's forget the incomprehensible behaviors of some characters, and not-so-good acting of some players.The ending (no spoilers) of `Saw II' is certainly surprising, but you may call it silly. But I found the original's ending surprising and silly, and in this sense the sequel did a fine job, a rare thing you can find these days when you see dreadfully silly sequels like `Cube 2.' `Saw II,' which benefits from bigger budget and more calculated editing, is a success as far as its visceral sensation goes. For all the dull explanations about Jigsaw's motives or many other atrociously philosophical nonsense, `Saw II' doesn't hide the fact that the film is all about the 'game,' about having fun, about feeling sensation and shock, and as such it is quite good.",Saw II

When you see a Tim Burton movie with Johnny Depp in it, expect anything but a normal, mainstream film. They always were a good pair. While Gene Wilder's version was good, I really enjoyed this one.  Johnny Depp's facial expressions were pretty comical and the other actors were excellent too. Some people just don't get it. Can't wait for the DVD.",N/A

The bill comprised of ""Vertigo"" and ""To Catch A Thief"". I was so spellbound by ""Vertigo"", that I remember very little of, ""To Catch A Thief"". The story is wonderful lots of twists and at times very droll. James Stewart, great as always, but Kim Novack was so radiant in the film that I dreamt of her for months after. I have viewed this film countless times and still am caught off guard by the story turns.

918137,"I bought this movie before even seeing it, and it was well worth it! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon have wonderful chemistry. And for those of you who aren't big Fallon fans, you'll be surprised... I was shocked to learn that this is a Farrelly brother's movie, the same guys who brought us crazy flicks like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary. I guess their getting tame in their old age, but that's nothing to scoff at because this is an altogether great movie. Great date movie, great romantic comedy, great comedy, great everything.Barrymore is Lindsay, a hardworking executive-type who scarcely has a minute when she isn't on the phone. Ben is a laidback geometry teacher, the teacher that all the kids like because he knows how to have fun. Ben meets Lindsay while he's taking a few of his students on a field trip to the same company that Lindsay works for. After a bit of teasing from his students that he could never get a girl who is that classy, he takes a leap and asks her out. She says no. A few days later, Lindsay's friends are bugging her because she expects to much from a relationship, and even Lindsay begins to realize that she's only been dating ""poodles."" On the first date, he goes to pick her up and, surprise, she has food poisoning. He never leaves her side. Their relationship grows, but an unexpected turn comes in mid-March. It's the beginning of the Red Sox season, and she has NO idea just how big a fan he truly is. So the question is... can she survive having a relationship with ""summer guy"" when she already knows that she loves ""fall guy""?Very, very funny and very sweet. The whole disastrous first date scene really had me laughing, especially when you can hear the nasty sound of her puking coming from the bathroom followed by her yelling at her dog to ""don't eat that!"" I suppose a bit of that familiar Farrelly brothers comedy does peak out throughout this movie. What amazed me was Fallon's performance. Seriously. Didn't know he had it in him, especially after Taxi. There's nothing not to like about this. Yes, it does follow the boy-meets-girl formula, but this movie is FRESH! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",N/A

It's just nice to see someone at Universal(obviously not some 20 something)put alot of thought into this box and it shows. Given the sad state of mainstream cinema today, it's quite nice to see the classic stuffget a packaging overhaul. So go ahead and treat yourself, this box is definetly worth it AND more...

635073,"The War of the Worlds is a great novel and Spielberg is a director of exceptional talent and accomplishment, so I had been hoping for a lot from this film. In the event, I have got part of what I was hoping for. Very occasionally, a novel can be 'walked' straight on to the screen (The Big Sleep, with a script by Faulkner, is a striking case), and I found myself wondering whether this novel might not have benefited from the same treatment. Some of Spielberg's changes are perfectly reasonable, others less so in my own opinion. It makes perfectly good sense to bring the action forward by a century into the present day, for instance. I suppose there's no harm either in changing the main actors from Wells's scientist with a wife and a brother to a dysfunctional American family, as this may provide enhanced 'human interest' or some such benefit for all I would know. Again, I have no real problem with the way the film combines the roles of the curate and the artilleryman in the book into the single persona of the former ambulance-driver, and I can well understand that Spielberg would have thought it prudent to tone down the socialistic elements in this aspect of the story in order to avoid setting off the wrong types of reaction in American audiences. What I do have a major problem with is the appearance of the Martians themselves. I'm sorry to report that these have far too much in common with a certain wretched TV series. The author's own description is one that stays in the memory, to say the very least, and Wells's Martians look the way they do for very clear reasons that he provides. What was gained by going downmarket in the way Spielberg chooses to do? Nothing that I can think of except perhaps better audience figures from harking back to that ghastly broadcast series.In fact the best things in the film come directly from Wells. Even one of the best lines, where the statement that the invaders come from somewhere else is met with the question 'Where - Europe?' is a very clever adaptation of a good joke in the book comparing the attitudes of Mrs Elphinstone to the Martians on the one hand and the French on the other. The Martian tripods are simply terrific, their appearance lifted more or less exactly from the book. However The War of the Worlds is a work of political and social philosophy and speculation, not just some science-fiction yarn. I really would have liked Spielberg to be a bit more ambitious and reflect this more than he seems to have felt like doing. For one thing, the Martians are invading the earth because their own smaller planet is cooling and dying around them. Wells explicitly says that there is no reason to suppose them 'pitiless'. They have come for pressing practical reasons connected with their own very survival. We know now, as Wells did not, that all they were going to find on Venus is a searing hell under the rolling white clouds, so it would be more than likely, as Wells says again, that they would learn from the failure of their first expedition and come back to the earth better prepared the next time rather than stake everything on one throw, which is what the film seems to be suggesting. The last gesture of the Martians in the film is an expression indicative of hatred, which doesn't even make sense considering they saw us as their food source. What consumer of beef makes hostile faces at beef-herds? The Martians' purpose can't have been 'extermination' as someone is made to say in the film, only subjugation, another matter perfectly clear from the novel.More survives of the view Wells takes of the behaviour of humanity itself, and Spielberg handles the mob-scenes rather well. However what he tones down more than I would have wished is the reflections, in the novel expressed via the persona of the artilleryman, on the likely behaviour of human beings towards one another once the Martian dominion was hypothetically established. The artilleryman's predictions are class-based like the vision of the Eloi and Morlocks in the Time-Machine, but they are far from endorsing Marxism and there is no reason to see them as any firm viewpoint held by the author himself.Perhaps the very best things in the entire film are to be found in the voiceovers right at the start and right at the end. The words are lifted almost verbatim from the novel itself at these points, and they are simply awesome, the first page in particular of The War of the Worlds being surely one of the greatest in all English fiction with the last page not far behind it in that respect. The exquisite irony of the fact that the Martians, who might have viewed us as we view micro-organisms in a laboratory were in their turn thwarted and destroyed by just such organisms when nothing humanity could do availed in the least is obviously not lost on the director. I just wish he had raised his game more consistently to something like the level of the theme he was taking on.",N/A

430121,"Note that elements of the plot are discussed. It's summer, 1939, in Germany. On a Nazi work farm, elderly prisoners are using primitive hoes and shovels to dig up a field. Strutting around them is a guard carrying a rifle and a whip. Nearby a scarecrow with a burlap face and straw sticking out of its gloves is tied to a post. ""Stop talking,"" the guard snarls. He raises his rifle and points it at one of the prisoners, a man who had been a famous pianist. The prisoners cower and the guard laughs as he slowly aims the rifle at different prisoners. Finally he turns, aims the rifle at the scarecrow and fires. The prisoners begin digging again as the guard turns away. We see a thin line of blood begin to drip from the scarecrow's hand to the ground.The next day on a train leaving a German city, a small group of English college students are reading a newspaper. The students are led by their archeology professor, Horatio Smith, a forgetful, eccentric, life-long bachelor who abhors violence and finds Nazis impossible to take seriously. The students read that a political prisoner, a famous pianist, had been taken from a work camp. The Gestapo believe he was aided by a man disguised as a scarecrow who was wounded. One of the students turns to Professor Smith, who is quietly reading, and starts to ask the Professor what he thinks...but he stops in mid-question. He motions to the others to look at Professor Smith's wrist. Barely visible is a bloodied bandage.Pimpernel Smith is one of the great British WWII films designed to strengthen the morale of the British people, and while doing so, to ridicule the Nazis and emphasize their ruthlessness. Thanks to a timeless story and the skills of Leslie Howard as an actor and director, Pimpernel Smith also is a great romantic adventure.Professor Smith (Howard) was responsible for a number of abductions. He believes the Nazis stand for all which is primitive and bestial. He became determined to save as many as he could of those who stood for the best of civilization. After his students discover what he has been doing while disappearing at times from their archeological dig, he plans to send them home. They insist on staying and helping him. They rescue several more prisoners, including a Polish newspaper publisher whose daughter, Ludmilla Koslowski (Mary Morris), has been tricked by Gestapo General von Graum (Francis L. Sullivan) into helping him capture this phantom. And Professor Smith, the bachelor whose ideal of woman is an ancient Greek statue, begins to realize Miss Koslowski is a treasure he never thought he'd meet.While his students escort two Gestapo victims to freedom across the border, Professor Smith returns to Berlin alone to rescue Miss Koslowski. The climax of the movie is a deadly cat and mouse game between Smith and von Graum, who has become obsessed with this Englishman. He captures Smith right after Smith has seen to Ludmilla's safety at a border crossing. It's late at night and he has Smith stand under an outdoor light in front of the border gate. He holds a pistol in his hand. He intends to shoot Smith while Smith is ""escaping."" But a small disturbance, a wisp of smoke, a trace of fog and Smith is gone. All von Graum can hear is a whisper in the night from Smith that he will be back, sooner or later he will be back, and there will be tens of thousands with him.This movie has clever action, smart dialogue and an understated romance. The themes of patriotism, steadfastness and valor are all there, but so is an expertly made adventure story. The movie works because Leslie Howard, in translating the Scarlet Pimpernel story in which he starred in 1935 to 1939, has created a believable character who at first seems eccentric and ineffectual, and then shows himself to be brave, witty, resourceful and even romantic. Howard does a grand job of it.The movie is not out on DVD, but there is a VHS tape which is still supposed to be available. My copy is old; the picture and sound leave much to be desired.",Pimpernel Smith VHS
76589,"""The Terminator"" is the first installment of one of the best Sci-Fi franchises, but this movie not only is one of the best Sci-Fi movies that you can find, it's also one of the best action movies as well. The story in this movie is so clever that it doesn't matter if some of the visual effects look outdated today, or if some music tracks sound kinda silly, because the plot of this movie must be the most intelligent story about machines.The main characters have a lot of depth, specially when we are talking about robots. Arnold Schwarzenegger is just perfect for the role of a killer cyborg that travels from the future whose mission is to kill Sarah Connor, the woman that eventually will give birth to John Connor, the leader of the humanity in an apocalyptic future. Sounds cool, doesn't it?Linda Hamilton plays the role of Sarah Connor, a young woman living a simple live, and overnight she becomes the target of Arnie. At the beginning of the film she is kinda sweet and shy, but at the end of the day she becomes a survivor, fighting for her life and for the life of her unborn child. Sarah Connor is one of the toughest movie heroines that you will ever see (specially in the sequel).Michael Biehn is also great as Kyle Reese, a warrior that travels from the future to protect Sarah from Arnie. And of course Schwarzenegger found the role of a lifetime in the Terminator franchise, nobody else could fit in this role like Arnie. James Cameron also built a strong reputation with this film, Cameron is one of the best directors in the Sci-Fi or action genres, also he knows a lot of stuff about technical aspects like visual effects and action sequences.The action sequences are jaw-dropping and thrilling, check out the high speed chases, and of course, the final battle. ""The Terminator"" is one of the best Sci-Fi movies, it doesn't matter if some visual effects look dated, because the story will test the proof of time, like the good wines.",N/A

535864,"Being a fan of romantic comedies, I decided to give `The Wedding Planner' a try. While this may not be the best movie that I have seen from this genre, I was pleased with it as it lived up to my expectations.Mary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) is one of the best wedding planners, but leads a solitude life outside her work by spending time with her father playing scrabble. One day a man saves her life from a runaway dumpster, and Mary starts getting feelings for him. Mary's friend Penny (Judy Greer) sets up Mary and Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey) the doctor who saved her life, on a date. Just when Mary feels like she has found Mr. Perfect, she finds out that Steve is the groom for one of the weddings that she is planning! Furthermore, her father sets her up with Massimo (Justin Chambers), a man Mary doesn't want to get involved with.This movie had a lot of funny moments like:i. every scene with Penny in it. It was such a delight to see Judy Greer play a comedy role for once. I've only seen her play negative roles in movies like `Cursed' and '13 Going on 30' and it was such a change to see how funny she was here.ii. When Massimo and Steve try to out beat each other in the beginning. Actually, even Justin Chambers who played Massimo was funny in most of the scenes.iii. The horse riding scene. It was hilarious to see Mary trying to control the crazed horse.Director Adam Shankman (who also directed `A Walk To Remember') did a fine job in this movie. Okay, Okay, so the story is predictable, and the actors overdid their Italian accents, but you cannot help but feel for them while you are watching it. Jennifer Lopez, Judy Greer, Justin Chambers, Alex Rocco and everyone else did a great job for their roles. I was a little disappointed with Matthew McConaughey since he kept portraying the same clueless looks and emotions throughout the movie, but he didn't too such a bad job either.In short, this is a breezy romantic comedy that anyone would enjoy watching.

419276,"Like other reviewers here I agree. There is A LOT of military stock footage in this. What makes it worse is the obvious film quality of the stock and the actual movie. You can tell when it's jumping back and forth.Anyway, the movie itself is very good and has some great parts. The little girl who sets fire to her basement is classic. When she smiles eerily at the camera ala 'Bad Seed' the director definatly nailed what he was after.The mutants are awesome too. Check out how they walk and run around like they're on some weird drugs or something. Watching them is hilarious. Also the Brain-Being in the fish bowl is a hoot. Check him out, he looks like a Wizard of Oz reject with the silver paint and little octopus arms. Sinister yet goofy, that's always a plus when watching these flicks.Surprisingly the hero, little David is not at all aggravating. Usually these kids are so bad they make the movie impossible to watch, but the little kid did a good job. Not like watching Dougie Howser or something. He played the scene real good in the police station when his mother came to get him. Speaking of the police station, what an eerie place that was! It looked like a weird corridor to another world, just plain white walls with a police desk what seamed 50 feet high down a long empty hallway.

The Communist Russians were known as Reds, as Mars is the red planet? That's what this movie was really about, fighting communism. McCarthy wanted everyone to think that as communist forces took over countries, the citizens would act like braindead drones such as the good wholesome Americans acted as they got brain controlled by the Martians in this movie.

I was really looking forward to seeing this, and I was one of the first in line to get it. When I saw it I wasn't displeased, but it wasn't as great as the first. The bad things about this is the music also isn't as great, the plot confuses me at points, the hitcher on this one isn't nearly as good as Rutger hauer from the first movie, the way the hitcher dies on this one is a bit stupid and the main character from the first gets killed on this one and the woman has to kill the hitcher by hirself. The camera work looks a bit bad in this film also. But still, the action still has its place in this sequel. Too be honest, this film is not nearly as dark or as atmospheric as the original. There are no huge stunts, massive action sequences or anything. I do recommend the shootout scene in the restaurant though. But, really, you have to see the first film, since that is an all time classic. Get that instead.",The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting
901802,"Now and then movies with big name stars and expensive production budgets and PR hype that convince audiences that the Rapture is at hand hit the mat with a thud - and this HITCH is floored in the first half hour (of an overly long two hour movie!).  Using a script that uses every clich&eacute; from the myriad other films that tell this same story gimmick using females in the Smith role of date doctor, this movie limps along with silly dialogue and pratfall type of comedy, all of which could be forgiven if there was a magical chemistry between the two top stars to make it click.For all the talent Will Smith has demonstrated in the past (despite his recent over the top laffapaloozas like 'I, Robot', 'Men in Black I & II', 'Bad Boys I & II') such as 'Ali', 'Six Degrees of Separation', 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', he seems bent on accepting roles that are beneath him. In this bit of fluff he wastes time talking directly to the audience about the fine art of capturing a girl and then demonstrates his techniques ad infinitum on some blundering characters, ultimately  trying to apply his own wisdom in courting Eva Mendes. At this point there should be romantic magic to make this dud work, but the chemistry between the two is so polar that we are forced to wait out a dating game that is less interesting than a Home Depot commercial.The direction is sluggish when it begs to be slick and the acting is rudimentary at best.  NOT for fans of the gifts of Will Smith, but if you're in need of a popcorn summer flick to fan away the heat, you might try this lump of ice.  Grady Harp, June 05",N/A

When you hold the Superman series next to the Batman series, there is such a big difference. The Batman series opens up into four discs, each one with a picture on it. With Superman, you get one picture disc, and the other is blank. They did this with the first set too. I can't understand why they would take the cheap way out.

In reality this movie isnt a giallo in the classic sense ( maybe why some folks dont get it) - Cozzi subverts the genre he knows so well from working with Argento - and creates a tense thriller much more in the mould of Hitchcock's Frenzy than the multiple murder pile up we're used too. Our concerns are for the killer more than the victims which creates an unease whilst watching that I really enjoyed. The movie comes in a stunning cinemascope presentation, with a great pounding score - loaded with three (!) featurettes but by far the best extra is the fascinating commentary track - its like a masterclass in thriller making - Which is good for me!",N/A
557049,"Okay, so I know movies aren't history, and I accept that, but could we at least try to get a bit closer? Mel Gibson's Martin comes across as a cross between Robin Hood and Francis Marion (the real life guerilla leader in South Carolina during the Revolution). Fortunately for political correctness, Martin is evidently a Southerner who believed in freeing his slaves, and was such a saintly master that they welcome him with open arms to their island when he seeks refuge. The villian of the piece is played with teeth-knashing relish and complete inaccuracy. The whole movie is sort of a glossed over Reader's Digest version of the American Revolution in the South. Oh, and my least favorite scene? Where the Americans, who were always low on powder and shot during the real war, waste tons of it blowing up a British ship in the harbor of Charleston.The sets and costuming are excellent, and the soft focus camera work gives a nice patina, but if you're looking for something to remotely reflect the real Revolution this movie will drive you mad!",N/A

Later, after ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks"", Lynch finally hit gold with the public.  Watching ""Dune"" again after that or now, the film has a much more literal and appreciative quality.

662194,"Everyone has an opinion, so I will give mine.  This movie is good not only because Harris gave an inspired performance, but also because he both nailed Pollock and exemplified the times that were American Abstract Expressionism.  You must remember that Peggy Guggenheim and Pollock are the pair that made Modern American Art credible, which before them (patron and artist), modern art was European, and Americans were ""unimportant.""Action Painting is the genre that Pollock worked in.  The feeling for it is born inside the viewer (ideally) who must associate with the patterns, colors, and detail, or it's all garbage.  You relate your real life to the reality of the forms in the painting.  Think of Ultra Conservative vs. Radical (in an attempt to use a common model).  Polarizing . . . huh?  For instance, when you view works of John Singer Sargent, you may think of someone you know who is particularly aristocratic or authoritative, or Rembrandt, someone who is sage and avuncular.  These works align beauty with convention.  Your feelings are rarely mixed.  Instead, Pollock's work is polarizing, for you see either something you viscerally understand (perhaps regrettably) or simply stupid, confusing lines, blobs, and a mess.  You may both love and hate (fear) abstract art at once.  This is what I mean by polarizing: your mixed emotions will be in extremes.To me, Pollock is visceral.  For years, action painting horrified me, when I could only understand Rembrandt, Rubens, or Boucher, etc.  Then life happened to me, and I finally realized that life doesn't have to be a perfect and pretty picture to be loved.  It's your visceral remembrance (erudition) that forms who you really are.  Compare Pollock's work LUCIFER (1947).  This painting is the definition of what I'm talking about.  Then, it's true that from Impressionism on, patrons have to be a little ""abstract"" themselves, or you'll never get it, or even need to.  There will always be Rembrandt.Harris's story gives insight enough into how Pollock became rich and famous, and deeply tortured.  Lastly, he confessed more than once, by the end, that he felt like a fraud, especially when he ran out of ideas . . . .",Pollock

The movie is a humorous, dark, cynical, satirical look at the life of a junkie and the effects of heroin on the lives of himself and his friends.It also comes across as a social commentary piece, juxtaposing the mundane activites of everyday society with the fixed purpose of a ""sincere and honest"" drug habit. The movie in no way condones the use of drugs but does show the kinds of motivation that initiate it. It's very postmodern in that the movie critiques the ""grandnarratives"" of modern society and shows how empty and supeficial they are, even to the extent that a drug habit is more appealing than living exposed to modern-day plastic consumerism hyper reality. The superficiality of society and the norms are starkly contrasted with the real, physical, painful, purposeful life that governs and directs someone on smack!Apart from the postmodern themes and ideas that the movie posits, at the end of the day it's just a great piece of extraordinary filmmaking with delighful exchanges, a wonderful soundtrack and a lot of jokes about Sean Connnery!I don't want to spoil any more of the suprise so all I can do is suggest that you go out and buy this NOW!

This is an emerald of a jaunty little Irish tale that thoroughly entertains with a fine cast and superb Irish music and leaves the audience wholly satisfied - AND has a fine social comment!The setting is County Clare where the International Irish Music festival is at hand.  For years John-Joe McMahon (Bernard Hill) and his little band have won the ceili (Irish dance music) band competition.  Members of his hometown orchestra include young Anne (Andrea Corr) and her unmarried grumpy piano-playing mother Maisie (Charlotte Bradley).  Word comes round that John-Joe's long estranged brother Jimmy (Colm Meaney) has a band from Liverpool, a band that includes Liverpudlian types including young and handsome flautist Teddy (Shaun Evans) and is aimed in the direction of the Festival to compete.  In fine Irish tradition the two mutually angry brothers try to sabotage each other's appearance, but alas they both come face to face in the competition.  With Jimmy's arrival we discover that Maisie's negative outlook comes from the fact that Jimmy is the one who wantonly got her pregnant and Anne is Jimmy's daughter.  Maisie is forced to admit to Anne her betrayal of ancestry news and the mother/daughter relationship is strained to the breaking point.Anne and Teddy (naturally) fall for each other and the two of them decide to return to Liverpool after the festival ends with neither's band the winner.  This development is threatening to Maisie and she finally confronts Jimmy with her pent up resentment and disappointment.  How the young ones cope with their situation and emotions and resolve the problem of distance is the finale of this sweet story and is best left to the viewer to discover.The acting is homogeneously fine with the comedy and drama in fine balance.

It's a shame, because I feel that if I had been expecting a little less, I would have liked this movie more.  I'm not saying that Fight Club is a bad movie, all I'm saying is that I don't get it the way some people do (although there are many people who don't get some of my favorite movies the way I do, such as Lost In Translation and Garden State).Edward Norton plays the unnamed Narrator, an insomniac who is obsessed with material goods, namely furniture.  When his condo, and by default, all of his furniture, is destroyed in an explosion, he moves in with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a strange but intriguing man that he met on an airplane.  Tyler's home could not be more different from the Narrator's; the house was dilapidated, it had almost no furniture, save a few beds and tables, and was beyond an eyesore.  But it doesn't matter because the two men become good friends.  Eventually, they start Fight Club, which is kind of like a support group for men who want to just let loose and blow off some steam.  At first, the two are really into it, and it is a small, exclusive little thing.  But soon it grows until there are clubs all over the country, and membership reaches numbers greater than 1,000.  That's when things start to get weird for the narrator.  People start acting very different around him, and they seem to blindly follow Tyler in whatever he does.Also, there is this girl named Marla (Helena Bonam-Carter, who does not look to good in this film) who is somewhat of a mystery to the Narrator.  She always seems to be over to make love with Tyler, but when they're done, she tries to talk to the Narrator.  He is confused by the situation, and it causes her to get really angry and storm out.I don't know; some of the people I know have said that this is one of those movies that you have to view more than once in order to fully understand, but as much as I enjoyed it, I feel that once is enough for a while.

I think many from less then fortunate homes hope for such a home as portrayed in this film.  Touching, deep, with enough humor to keep us from getting too emotional, the story is about people, and family and caring for one another.  The film starts out briefly in the late 60's, and we spend a fair amount of time in the 70's getting to know the boys, Bobby and Jonathan, who in essense become brothers through circumstance, not through blood lines.  I would say about half the story line is set in the 1980's as we explore the dynamics of the adult relationships as they relate to the childhood one shared by the boys.  At times, especially early, the film loses momentum, though very briefly.  Don't leave for a drink or snack, as the film and the plots move quickly.  This is a film that could have used an extra 15 minutes.  I found the sound levels to be a tad low at times. The soundtrack is excellent, poignant and draws in the viewer to the drama unfolding - fantastic selection of music.

Some are good and some make the movie quite ridiculous.  I like the fact that the football to the groin is thrown at a crooked ref rather than a player.  One change I thought was particularly weak was making the idea of the guards playing the prisoners something new.  In the original it was something that happened every year, but the prisoners were simply beat up and the ""superstar"" was there to give them an edge.  Here, the quarterback is supposed build a team from nothing to a semi-pro quality team in a month.  I don't think so.  Another thing, Eddie Albert as the warden in the original is a lot more sinister than the mean but feckless James Cromwell is in this version.Anyway, this movie is about as raucous for our time as the original was for its.  However, the murder of caretaker is less gruesome and shocking in this remake than it was in the original.  If you want to watch Adam Sandler in a fairly mindless movie, this is OK.  However, if you want the better telling of this story, go rent the original 1974 movie with Burt Reynolds.",N/A

921903,"""Veronica Mars"" is a remarkable melding of genres--it's noir disguised as teen soap opera--and its young star, Kristen Bell is a real find.  This show is genuinely dark, intricately plotted, and brilliantly written. (If it were on a larger network than UPN, no doubt these qualities would have gotten it cancelled long ago.)  And Bell appears to be able to do anything.  She's great at comedy, tears your heart out at the tragic moments, all while nicely underplaying in the best noir tradition.  She's even able to subtly suggest that Veronica is a flawed, even damaged character because of her ordeals, and is groping towards some normality and redemption.  If Sarah Michelle Gellar is really tired of playing Buffy, it looks like Joss Whedon has found his new star.  So, ""Arrested Development"" fans who are distraught over the axing of their favorite series; come on over to ""Veronica Mars.""  It's so fine.",Veronica Mars: Season 1

The director, Mr. Selz, makes ingenious usage of an unused Illinois prison to add realism to the movie.  I don't want to give out details-this is a must see for any horror fan.

Both women, eager to stay young forever, visit the mysterious Isabella Rossellini (wonderfully campy) who gives them a potion for eternal youth.  What happens then is pure fun as both Hawn and Streep find themselves ""dead"" and needing plastic surgeon Willis to keep their bodies together.

301496,"If Gimme Shelter (also made by the Maysles brothers) marks the end of the 60s, then this film signals the start.True, it's set in February 1964, but the heart and soul of this decade (at least musically) began on this fateful week when the Beatles landed in America.  The Maysles were both fortunate and wise enough to capture the Fab Four both onstage and behind the scenes: sparring with the press, catching trains and planes, trapped in hotel rooms, posing for cameras and playing their music to thousands of screaming fans.Like D.A. Pennebaker (Don't Look Back), the Maysles are pioneers in documentary filmmaking.  Cinema verite (capturing life as it happens from a detached distance without using narration) was born in the early sixties, largely on the shoulders of these two New York filmmakers.For decades, the entire film has been incredibly hard to find.  I recall 50-minute versions of this film floating around on VHS (legit or not).  However, it wasn't until the recent release of this film in its entirety that I could appreciate it as a real movie and not just a TV special about The Beatles.The FIRST U.S. VISIT towers above the pile of exploitive dreck that has The Beatles slapped on its cover.  Why?  The close access and the way it's shot (handheld in glorious black and white).  Each of the Beatles' personalities shines forth that is true, honest and charming.  By comparison A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a thinly fictionalized version of this footage.The special features in which Albert Maysles guides us through a treasure trove of outtakes is a sweet bonus.  My favourite moment is the family watching the Ed Sullivan Show live in their living room.  The kids can't sit still.  That scene alone tells you what Beatlemania was all about -- 41 years later and counting.",The Beatles - The First U.S. Visit VHS
202853,"In 1983, director Joe Alves had given us the film, JAWS 3, the least and disliked sequel in the whole JAWS series.It has been another four years since Amity Island was again terrorized by a second killer great white shark. Now, in 1983, four years after the events of the second film, 21-year-old, MICHAEL BRODY (played by Dennis Quaid), son of Martin & Ellen Brody, who do not appear in this film, is now working at one of Florida's favorites, Sea World. His assistant is KATHERINE MORGAN (played by Bess Armstrong). Visiting Michael in Florida is Michael's younger brother, SEAN BRODY (played by John Putch) and his girlfriend, KELLY ANN BUKOWSKI (played by Lea Thompson, in her pre-Back To The Future days). Michael and Katherine have opened up an Under The Sea kingdom, where customers can go into this tunnel and see everything swimming around. Running this whole thing is CALVIN BOUCHARD (played by Louis Gossett Jr.), a man who happens to be completely ignorant, greedy, and stupid in not knowing that a great white shark, and her baby, have snuck right into the park. The sharks make series of deaths until, Michael, Katherine, and Sean finally kill them off, saving every fish and mammal in their park.Okay, I loved JAWS & JAWS 2, but JAWS 3 was really bad. The 3D effects have saved itself from having me give the film three stars instead of two. My two-star rating means I did not quite enjoy the film, but the 3D effects did boost up my enjoyment, so that's that. I did buy this film a while ago, not from any online stores, but I did buy the film, just to have all of the films on tape. But this sequel was pretty bad.",N/A

She is shocked when she learns her sister Maylee is engaged to her recent ex-husband Anthony.  Maylee is a hootchie more interested in men that her own 14 year old daughter who is living with Madea.  This is such a hilarious--yet serious play.  I don't want to be a spoiler but the twists and turns of the storyline will keep you on your feet.  The neighbor Mr. Brown provides comic relief.  It's a great play and it although it's a comedy it addresses serious issues.  YOu must check out the extras. The play includes a wonderful featurette with Tyler Perry providing some behind the scene details of this particular play.  It seems the theater flooded prior to the performance and a Friday show had to be canceled. Tyler went out to speak to the crowd and signed autographs.  He really felt bad about canceling the show due to the power being out because most of the fans didn't want a refund they wanted to see the show.  ""I Can Do Bad By Myself,"" also addresses some of the themes featured in the film ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman,"" most noticibly a woman who has escaped a verbally abusive man who is hesitant to embrace real love.

This is not about vampires at all; its a psychological analysis of one man's descent into complete insanity.  The vampire bit is just there to remind us that he has lost his marbles.As the lead guy who goes insane, Cage is incredible!  He starts out a sophisticated and eccentric book editor.  By the end of the movie he's a blubbering and foaming maniac.  His conversation with the cement stairway railing endpost on the streets of New York is one of the funniest and strangest scenes ever.  He's hit rock bottom!The fun of the movie is not bats or coffins or pretty girls being stylishly seduced by his vampire coolness.  The fun is watching Cage slowly and completely lose his mind.  Although his character really believes he's a vampire and gives it the old ""college try"", his pathetic effort fails moronically and laughably.  Obviously, his character never read an Anne Rice novel.Cage is not a sympathetic character and in the end he gets exactly what he wants and justly deserves.Cages' acting is wonderful!  But, if you like vampire movies, you will not like this movie.  My daughter's friend hated it!  But, she sat through the whole thing.If you're a goth person and like to dress up as a vampire or for some stupid reason you think you're somehow related to Count Dracula, you will also hate this movie.

The whole story is about this community, who early on you figure out they aren't normal, and there are creatures assumingly from outer space. The creatures are big headed, big teethed, and not really scary though I am not sure they were supposed to be. We have a teenager, Daniel, who is going to be turning 18 and something big, is going to happen at his birthday ""celebration"", and I guessed it wasn't going to be a new car with all the ominous music and hints. His parents, one of which is an alien his mother, the other of which is Laura Ingalls husband , try to protect him by sending him to Australia, the aliens don't swim I suppose or like Outback steakhouse.

The whole town is on a mission to convert our Daniel into whatever alien teenagers turn into, Hunter Tylo clumps around the entire movie with giant lips (I thought they ate collagen not injected it) and epileptic seizures when she is hungry. The ending is predictable and the aliens are supposed to be reminiscent of old 50's creature features but end up really looking and acting like my middle schools production of Journey to the center of the earth.

638288,"Another solidly packed midnight preview screening and the film clocks in at over 3 hours!Well, where to start, eh?I've avoided the trailers, reviews, posters, etc, so that my experience would not be tainted by advance publicity. Thus, I sat in the theatre like a newborn virgin expecting the first tinges of excitement.The script, although containing several new plot threads, follows the classic formula set down by the original film. The first hour is spent building up the characters, setting up the mystery and allowing some comedy elements to seep in.Jack Black, who I normally abhor, is acceptable in his role as the megalomaniac director pursuing a doomed project, Adrien Brody has enough charm in his eyes to carry off his role as secondary hero, Andy Serkis as the ship's cook and Kong is simply awesome, Noami Watts lacks the raw eroticism of Jessica Lange and the primordial energy of Fay Wray but she bestows her role with acres of bubbly charisma. The chemistry between her and Kong is palpable and time is given to showcase their tragic romance.The film has been lovingly created by Peter Jackson and his team of film magicians but there are several moments where the CGI effects look flakey and unvarnished. However, the pacing never wavers and any technical deficiency is easily overlooked by the sheer scale of the adventure which rampages across the screen. The artistic design of the film is beautifully realized and no expense has been spared in creating a mammoth world of danger and suspense. The natives of Skull Island are terrifying in a hallucinatory manner (someone should immediately give Jackson a CANNIBAL / ZOMBIE project next).Those amongst us who may deride the film for lacking any intelligent muscle, I simply say just take a moment and ponder upon the sly political subtext that Jackson has weaved into his film. The allusion to recent world events and the ensuing bloodshed is laid bare in the poignant climax. There is also much made of Joseph Conrad's THE HEART OF DARKNESS in the banter between the cabin boy, Jamie Bell, and the ship's Second Mate.The soundtrack, as with the recent NARNIA, never really soars and the main love theme lacks the melodic emotional resonance that should impale the hardest of hearts when Kong and his love spend a few tender moments as the sun sets on their world.Okay, the film may not be as groundbreaking in the way the original one was, but it still has tons of innovation and high octane adventure to capture the minds of most people.Recommended.",King Kong

The ONLY problem is that the resistance can't seem to accomplish anything without help, and that help is conveniently sought from the town's cafe owner. This character is a Lou Costello sort of fellow, but with considerably more intelligence; nevertheless, not enough to extricate himself out of the crazy schemes dreamt up by the French resistance leader. This is the plot of the show. Picture an ensemble Laurel and Hardy task-based sitcom werein the caricatured players are stealing/concealing/and playing hot potato with paintings to sell after the war; and are fashioning schemes (in a more adult manner, but reminiscent of the American classic rerun ""Gilligan's Island"") to return 2 airmen that were forced to bail out of their plane and dropped into this town, back to England.  The series is known for it's tag lines; think of The Honeymooners ""Bang Zoom""/""I've got a BIG mouth""/etc, ""Yes Minister""(from that eponymously named Britcom), & ""I know nothing"" (from Hogan's Heroes, a show which is more similar to 'Allo 'Allo than not), and multiply by 10.

843822,"The American acceptance of a subtitled film is a rare occurrence. Excepting Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ (and to some, the incredibly stupid Y Tu Mama Tambien), rarely has a foreign-language movie been as enjoyable to Americans as I'm Not Scared. It is set in 1978 rural Italy.The movie centers on the character of Michele, the 10-year-old son of Pino, an Italian criminal. Early in the story, Michele proves himself the most moral of his friends; when a female member of the group is voted the loser of a bet and must expose herself, he stops her and volunteers to ""pay up"" himself (in fact, he did lose the race, and ends up walking precariously over a high-altitude beam).Shortly thereafter, Michele discovers a secret under an outdoor panel near an abandoned house. Though this happens early in the movie, the details are not revealed until later - in fact, based only on the audience's first impressions, the movie would be placed in a completely different genre.Therefore, the basic plot of the movie is something of a spoiler. What can be revealed is this: I'm Not Scared is an outstanding movie, well worth dealing with the subtitles.Though the flick is often promoted and analyzed as a statement about youthful innocence, this is a bit inaccurate. Faced with the situation young Michele is, most people would react with fear.I'm Not Scared, rather, is a statement about courage and morality. The fact that the hero is 10 years old serves only to make it more remarkable and, oddly, more believable at the same time.Through its diverse personalities, the movie introduces the audience to all forms of good and bad. There is the almost-pure Michele, his mislead friends, his criminal-with-few-limits father, and a downright-evil gang leader.Director Gabriele Salvatores has no problem provoking moral judgments in the audience, a welcome contrast to Hollywood storylines where violence is promoted and adulterous sex scenes are shown against glorious background music.The personalities bounce against each other expertly, culminating in a disturbing but very hopeful conclusion. Not for a second does the movie lose the audience's concentration.Despite its violent plot and R rating, I'm Not Scared is far less graphic than it could be. Though there are some unsettling images, much of the suggested violence either appears off-screen or not at all. Once again, details would spoil the plot, but is safe to say a PG-13 rating would not have been unreasonable.Essentially, I'm Not Scared is a near-perfect movie, hurt only marginally by its use of subtitles. It is suspenseful and entertaining, and it has a clear message.",N/A
107654,"Five graduate college students, calling themselves the Groovers set out on their last road trip together to dig up Dom before going their separate ways. One a loner, one a ROTC, one confused, one a minister, and one passed out. Gardner Barnes played by Kevin Costner is the loner that will realize he should not have been so distant. Phil Hicks played by Judd Nelson is the ROTC that begins to appreciate life rather than constantly complain about it. Kenneth Waggener played by Sam Robards is confused about giving up a chance at marriage and whether he should show up for duty in the service. Dorman played by Chuck Bush studied for ministry but is not sure how to approach it. He finds that supporting those around him is the answer. Lester Griffin, played by Brian Cesak, is passed out for most their journey but will wake up just in time for their last night together. The directing, acting, sets, and music are all great.This movie was never a big hit, but it strikes a chord with most people that recall graduating from High School or College and spending a short time with their friends before going their own way. The journey in this case is to dig up a bottle not a friend. The journey is what makes this movie great because we realize that life is a journey and the trip is what makes it, not getting to the destination. Some scenes are hysterically funny like the Parachute School jump with pilot Truman Sparks played by Marvin J., McIntyre. Other scenes like the wedding are truly poignant. Don't miss the movie, it is one of Kevin Costner's and Judd Nelson's best. Fans of the 80s movies will definitely enjoy it. Although the timeline for the movie is 1971, the message is the same today. Life moves forward, so embrace it. The picture and sound quality on the DVD is excellent and it includes some extras. The soundtrack for this is wonderful if you are fan of rock and new age.

874208,"I really enjoyed this film and actually watched it again with the commentary.  It is a movie where you have to pay attention to get and understand everything, including the comic and existential overtones, but I like quirky films like this.  It kind of reminded me of some of the movies from the 60's that address existentialism.  Something you don't see talked about too much in society today.As the commentary notes, people don't really want to think about their existence today except in the form of ""what is the solution.""  Our society has really embraced so many things that quiet any higher thought in this area, but I feel optimistic that things come full circle and old and new thoughts will be addressed once again.  That's my 2 cents, anyway.As for the cast, this ensemble was outstanding and it was nice to see actors do comedy where it really is not their usual genre.  I really liked the interactions of Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman as ""existential detectives.""

However, as the movie kept going through my mind the next day, I began to reflect on what a great movie LDV is.  The problem I had was the bad taste that the movie left me with.  I didn't realize that this was probably the result that the director, Fellini, intended.""La Dolce Vita"" shows us the life of an Italian journalist who has a knack for being in the midst of celebrities and the social elites.  Consequently he seems to drift from one party to another.  This starts out interesting because he keeps his wits about him; never too drunk, doesn't lose sight of the story he's after, is attentive to those that appeal to him, and carries himself as a leader.  However, we begin to see the gradual decline of his focus and control.  People he cares about seem to drift away from him.  He struggles to write and he struggles to cope with the bizarre demise of the one man whom he truly looked up to.  However, the party never stops and he hasn't figured out it's time to go home.  Ultimately we are generally either saddened or disgusted by the depths to which he has sunk.  The image of the ""beautiful people"" in LDV gradually turns from fun and frolic into a life without purpose.  So many of the parties we are witness to seem meaningless and boring.As in most any Fellini movie, there are many terrific scenes, bizarre people, and brilliant imagery.  The acting is terrific as is the direction.  However, the sound mixing was as bad as in ""8 1/2"" where the voices and lip movements were so out of sinc that it looked like an Italian movie dubbed in Italian.""La Dolce Vita"" is three hours long which caught me off guard.  It doesn't seem that long because most every scene seems appropos to the theme of the movie.  I've only seen LDV once and I am sure this is a movie that will deliver new insights each time I see it again.  It may leave a viewer depressed but it may also make a viewer thankful for his mortgage, 40 hour a week job, and his kids that keep him busy another 40 hours a week.

874015,"On paper, Kidd's earlier film  Roger Dodger, about a snide Lothario (played to Oscar quality by Campbell Scott) and his attempts to ""mentor"" his nephew, seems the lesser of P.S., about an August/ April romance between an admissions officer at a Columbia art department and a young applicant who stuns her by looking like an old departed boyfriend.  But Roger Dodger feels tight, finished, and driven by a wild logic of its own, while P.S. is riddled with incompletenesses.  Laura Linney is such a fine and affecting actress that she could convince me she had erotic chemistry with a bookcase, but  despite her talents, the alleged electricity between her character and her young paramour in P.S., played by Topher Grace,  required frequent suspensions of my disbelief.  Grace here has such a hard time leaving his arch, ""That 70s Show"" schtick behind that he plays this film as though it were a bizarre dream sequence from his TV program.  He often looks impatient and half-in-character, as if he expects Laura Propane, his redheaded gal pal from the TV show, to rustle him awake so he can say, ""That was the weirdest dream"" and proceed in the comfortable universe of avocado and harvest gold situation comedy.  Also, the script for this film is half-baked.  Many oddities of character and plot, in addition to abrupt and mechanical statements of intentions by characters throughout the film, suggest an outline rather than a finished screenplay.

I'm not afraid to admit that I did watch this show for a while and did like it only because of its ""hook-liner"" premise: A family oriented television show concerning a man, Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams undoubtedly is easier to look at when he's got hair on his face), who has lost his wife and deals with the difficulties he goes though trying to reconnect with his Son, Ephram, an overly emotional teenage boy who seeks his old home in New York after moving to Everwood and blames his father for his mother's death, and his daughter Delia who doesn't appear to have any qualms about moving except when concerning her new school. But as the show progressed it began to turn to be just like all the other teendramas on WB54; The brooding teenage boy meets the 'The girl every-guy wants, with a dark past' young blonde girl (daughter of a Doctor who becomes rivals with Ephram's father, who reminds me of ""Squidward"" of Sponge-bob square-pants) and eventually develops feelings for her later on in the show, everyone in high-school has to be ""together/couple"" when in reality its not like that all, the dramas concerning the young girl Delia is mediocore but its believable, and the teenagers, (who are, naturally about as wise as a undeveloped tomato) always ends up correcting the Parents on everything instead of the other way around.The only real change is the more focus on the adults and their troubles. At least it was before the ""O.C"" and ""One-Tree Hill"" Reared their ugly heads. Teenagers who are into the heavy-drama type shows will enjoy ""Everwood"". It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, sadly.------- [a 3 out of 5]",Everwood: Season 1

I have never read the book, and was not aware that they changed the plot just a bit, until I read the other reviewers comments.  I have never seen any of the other film versions and don't plan on it, since this one is perfect.The story is about a spoiled yet negelected girl named Mary who goes to live with her father's old aquaintance in England after her folks die in a flu epidemic in India.  She at first hates her new home because it is so huge and dark. Also it is filled with sounds of moaning, which at first she thinks is a ghost.  She finally begins to take an interest in life after meeting her sweet maid Martha.  Martha introduces her to her brother Dicken and they eventually find a secret garden. Dicken teaches her how to love people and God's creation, and she becomes likable.  She eventually meets Colin, the invalid boy who stays in his room who has also dealt with loneliness and neglect like Mary.  They become friends with Dicken who continues to teach them about hope.  For fans of Colin Firth, you will be thrilled to know he plays the grown up Colin at the end of the film.

While Brian Cox's Lecktor will draw comparisons to Anthony Hopkin's version in subsequent movies, Cox plays the psychopath as a real threat -- a murderer who will kill. Hopkins is brilliant as well, but I always felt that his Lector was like an animal who would strike only of thouroughly provoked.

472411,"What we have here is a goo and gore fest which looks like it might have been co-directed by David Cronenberg (""The Fly"" is central to one of the film's wisecracks) and Jean Rollin, the French director who brought us that string of artsy sex-inflected vampire films.This is body horror at its most virulent, with a distinctive Tokyo overtone. Kei Fujiwara (of Tetsuo fame) directed this offering, and plays the central role of Yoko, who along with her brother Jun, run a slice-and-dice shop supplying fresh organ meat to the black market. They share a dirty little secret from their younger days (shades of Tetsuo - Bodyhammer, no?), and roam with splitter-splatter vicariousness through downtown Tokyo. Add to it the fact that Jun teaches biology at a girls' school, and has a sealed-off laboratory, and you've got all the makings of human tekka-maki.Every frame of this film portrays humankind at it most abject, gutter level. No one who comes in contact with Yoko or Jun - especially the cops - survives with sanity intact (if indeed they had any to begin with). It's an intense experience, like an amusement park ride, but is it art? Will you watch often?

769669,"Indiana, say it isn't so? Please say that making films like ""Hollywood Homicide"" isn't what has become of Han Solo. Please.It's hard watching screen legends tarnish their legacy. Marlon Brando tried his best to make everyone forget his earlier performances with repeated bombs like ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" and now it seems that Harrison Ford is content on doing the same.Ford is a homicide detective trying to make ends meet as he investigates the gangland style murder of a hip-hop group.Forgive the glossing over the plot. Just trying to follow the film's example.After all, the reason for this film is not the plot, it's to see Ford and co-star Josh Hartnett take their turn at the buddy comedy flick.While shows like CSI making cops look like the smartest, wittiest people on the planet, director Ron Shelton (the force behind ""Bull Durham"" and ""White Men Can't Jump"") decides to play his detectives a little differently.K.C. (Hartnett ""Pearl Harbor"") doubts whether or not he wants to remain an officer or chase his dream of becoming an actor. K.C.'s also a yoga instructor who is only teaching the class for the slew of 20-something year old would-be actresses who attend the class.While his partner has a rotating lineup for his bedmate, Joe Gavilan (Ford) is enjoying his three-week anniversary with Ruby, (Lena Olin from ""Alias"") a radio psychic.The film's walking joke (it starts off as a running joke, but it gets used so much it had to slow its pace to a walk) is that Gavilan is also selling real estate and buyers and sellers keep calling him at the wrong time trying to close deals. It's good for a few chuckles early on, but it becomes too much a crutch joke after a while to remain humorous.In chasing a suspect, our low-rent Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker pursue him around a duck pond. The suspect paddles with his hand on a paddleboat while K.C. runs around the lake telling him to step away from the duck waste. My, how clever.This truly is the film's defining moment. But that definition could read ""Hollywood Homicide"" - n. 1. Seriously unfunny buddy flick 2. Yet another would be Lethal Weapon 3. Last call of Harrison Ford's movie career.With the film's comedy component dying on the respirator, the dramatic aspect doesn't fare any better either. K.C.'s father was killed in the line of duty and there was suspicion that his partner may have had something to do with it.Just so the audience can understand everything, K.C. kindly explains to his partner of four months that the investigation was closed before anything was discovered.Matter-of-factly, Joe offers to call on some favors and learn what happened on the case. That's not the kind of conversation that happens oh, say, on the first month?Dollars to donuts (pun intended) that K.C.'s father's partner is running around involved in the criminal shenanigans. Whatever were the odds?Bruce Greenwood (""Double Jeopardy"") gets a thankless role as an Internal Affairs officer intent on bringing Joe down for humiliating him years ago. It's another needless subplot in a movie so wrapped up with creating new subplots that the whole point of the movie doesn't get addressed until three-fourths of the way.Shockingly (gasp) all of these clich&eacute; puzzle pieces fit exactly into place. As K.C. pieces everything together, there strangely was no ""well duh!"" subtitle at the bottom of the screen.Speaking of thankless roles, Isaiah Washington (""Romeo Must Die"") gets typecast once again as the bad guy and gets to be quite menacing until he gets into a slugfest with Ford.Washington is a talented actor desperately need of better material.Clearly, there's some sort of an attempt to mimic the cop buddy-flick feel of ""Lethal Weapon"" here, but even at the series' most outrageous, there was a modicum of common sense. Imagine if you will, instead of having the younger and more unbalanced Mel Gibson chasing after the bad guy, his older, veteran partner Danny Glover is going after them. Granted, Ford is a much bigger star than Hartnett likely will ever be so it's understandable that he's treated like the big gun. But Ford barely looks like he could run two blocks, let alone maintain a citywide chase without passing out. Age takes its toll on even the Blade Runner.If only this movie would go as fast...",N/A
787565,"Katie Holmes plays April, a young woman whose family has despaired of her.  She has invited them for Thanksgiving dinner, and it's particularly important because her mother (Patricia Clarkson) has cancer and is not expected to live. Katie is living in NYC with her boyfriend in the kind of grafitti-covered apartment building filled with an odd assortment of tenants that is only to be found in NY -- in other words, it will terrify her non-urban family.  The film begins as Katie wakes up -- she's never cooked a big dinner like this before and has a reputation for failure with her family.  In fact, her family puts her down so much that you quickly feel sorry for her -- no-one could be that bad, and isn't your family supposed to have an unnaturally high opinion of you, and not the other way around?Patricia Clarkson was amazing in this film; she is batty but at times her battiness is just simply playing with her family (there's a method in her madness).My only criticism would be that the whole subplot about what Katie's boyfriend is off doing while she's *trying* to cook the turkey -- well, that subplot just didn't work for me.Otherwise, this was a memorable film worth watching more than once.",Pieces of April

891058,"For those still counting, there are now 8 Hellraiser movies.  The first 4 made box-office appearances, with only the first two achieving a smidgeon of success.  The 4th Hellraiser movie, Kevin Yagher's overlooked ""Bloodline"", did so poorly at the box-office that from that point on subsequent sequels #5 and #6 were relegated to straight-to-DVD status.  As for entries #7(Deader)and #8(Hellworld) they didn't even make it that far, originally.  Apparently Dimension Films thought so little of them that they just sat on their shelves gathering dust for a couple years, un-released in any format whatsoever.  A company shake-up at Dimension now brings us these two new sequels to a franchise that was increasingly running out of ideas which each poor subsequent sequel.  Amazingly, Hellraiser: Deader is actually a pretty good entry and well worth a watch for the undiscriminating horror fan.Amy Klein is an American journalist from NYC who has recently been re-assigned to London to work for the ""London Underground"" paper.  She's an expert of the urban underworlds, who secretly infiltrates and befriends the lost souls of crack houses, whore houses, S&M; parlors and writes revealing exposes on them.  Her new assignment is most interesting: To go to Bucharest, Romania and infiltrate the secret society of the ""Deaders"", a strange cult that encourage suicidal and down-on-their-luck people to kill themselves.  The ""Deaders"" are then able to re-animate them and supposedly give them a new meaning to life.  With the help of some insiders, she gathers clues and eventually ends up opening the secret box, bringing back Pinhead and his Cenobites on this side of the world.  Pinhead and his minions of torture have a score to settle with the ""Deaders"" who are interfering with their universe and poor Amy now finds herself stuck in the middle of a very fierce battle...""Hellraiser: Deader"" is a competently shot sequel that makes good use of sound, music and some oppressively gothic Bucharest locations.  Director Rick Bota throws us head-first into a dirty, sleazy underworld of junkies, crazies, fetish hounds and cult loonies.  I particularly liked the subway car that appears throughout the movie.  Now this is not your average subway car, bear in mind.  It is one where pain and flesh addicts are attached to its walls with chains, as fetish-fiends fornicate to the tune of loud heavy metal music.As for our heroine, Amy is a chain-smoking, self-destructive and cynical girl whose miscues provide a few unintentional chuckles throughout.  For a journalist who is supposedly a seen-it-all veteran of underworld sleaze, she somehow freaks out at the sight of anything in the least bit disturbing.  Her deer caught in the headlights look was wearing thin on me after a while and it's not until right at the end that she finally develops a backbone to her.  Oh well, at least she's hot.As one would expect, leaks in logic abound.  Why would a newspaper company send an American journalist like Amy on an undercover European assignment?  She obviously doesn't fit in, with her noticeable accent.  And how come everyone Amy comes across in Romania speaks perfectly fluent English?  They speak Romanian in Romania don't they?  But heck, minor squabbles these are.  What's a horror b-movie good for when you can't poke a little fun at plot holes?  As for ol' Pinhead and gang their appearances are very limited throughout.  I counted two 30-second appearances by Pinhead (played again by Doug Bradley) on his own and then there's a rather gory 5-minute sequence at the end with him and his cenobites.  I can't help but feel like this franchise has become one where the whole Hellraiser theme is simply a banner and image with the brilliant mythos that Clive Barker created being swept aside.  Still, that doesn't make ""Deader"" a bad film.  For most of the time, I forgot I was even watching a Hellraiser movie, rather I was engrossed with Amy's quest.  Despite its flaws and formulaic nature, ""Hellraiser: Deader"" is a fine addition to the Hellraiser cannon, one that should appease many fans and newcomers alike.",Hellraiser: Deader
327098,"Since its first appearance in 1978, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"" has proven to be a surprisingly durable piece of work; it has survived the transition from radio to print to stage to screen, and will undoubtedly continue to survive in fresh new adaptations for generations to come. Although many reviewers have compared it to ""Star Wars"", I think a more appropriate analogy would be to compare it to ""The Wizard Of Oz"".L. Frank Baum (the Douglas Adams of his day) published ""Oz"" in 1901, and its success inspired him to pen numerous sequels and a series of silent films featuring the characters from the books. Although Baum's films were imaginative for their time, watching one today is a chore that not even an Oz fanatic can do twice. New advances in film technology made the big-budget 1939 version possible, but those same improvements also made Baum's early films unwatchable. In his lifetime, Douglas Adams feared that his 1981 TV adaptation of ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" was doomed to suffer the exact same fate. With the release of the film version in 2005, his prophesy came true.Although the radio and print versions of the series had their limitations, the fans could at least use their imagination to fill in the gaps. When the TV version appeared, the unique creations of the imagination were suddenly erased forever, crudely replaced with cheaply-made props and foam-rubber aliens. Despite the best efforts of BBC-TV's technicians and craftsmen, the TV series resembled a stage play more than a science-fiction movie. The only aspect of the radio series that improved with the transition to TV was the narration, which was cleverly illustrated with animated graphics that were lovingly detailed with hidden jokes for fans.Since first-time viewers are likely to be distracted by the amateurish special effects in the production, the compilers of the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" DVD package have decided to draw attention to them in hopes of turning a minus into a plus. A bonus disc is stuffed full of documentaries showing the laughable efforts of the BBC technicians (Zaphod's expensively-crafted extra head can't even close his eyelid), and all six episodes feature subtitles that sadistically point out every technical glitch for your pleasure.Technical note: the stereo remix may present some problems for viewers not eqipped with surround sound speakers. Peter Jones' narration is often isolated on one channel, which will cause considerable confusion if you're not using that channel. In addition, Deep Thought's voice is drowned in reverb. The simplest way to make the soundtrack intelligible is to choose the mono mix in the setup menu.The ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" remains one of the wittiest and cleverest series ever produced for radio, and I strongly recommend that you seek out the original BBC Radio productions from 1978-1979. I'm recommending this TV version only to long-time fans of the series. Newcomers are advised to see the movie - but only after you've read the books.",N/A

559320,"This film took me back in time to age 15 when the only thing that mattered was how many friends you had, how popular you were, & your status in the social pecking order. High school society is about the most meaningless, inane, irrational, and unproductive place in the world one can be. It is almost better to be dead than to go to school every day, a point that Agnes evidently concurred with (and uh, no, she doesn't die)...This is the messed-up and decadent reality of the modern world, where youth are idle, and have nothing to do with their time except obsess over shallow, hurtful social war-games. Our society does not engage young people in helping to solve today's problems; and so, many problems (like the lost of our manufacturing in the U.S.A., or our export of jobs and careers, and the demise of the American middle class, and the environment) simply do not get fixed, and people grow up callous and uninterested in solving social problems. This film indicts the entire system of education, which needs to be overturned and revised...I call the two main characters ""Real"" girls, in contrast to the other girls in this film, who are not real, but are phony, obsessed with playing the game and with getting into other people's business.  I do not idealize lesbians in particular, but to the extent that they are Real and willing to buck the social system and be Themselves, they are highly Admirable.These two girls have different personalities from each other, and it would have been really interesting to see how their relationship progressed over time.

886752,"I have been anticipating to see ""The Woodsman"" for sometime now. I finally caught the afternoon matinee and loved it. This film was very subtle and didn't adhere to your typical introduction, suspenseful build-up and climatic ending. The film was intense yet subtle.Kevin Bacon puts in an amazing performance as Walter, a pedophile who was recently released from prison. He is trying to start a new life after serving 12 years for molesting a few young girls (I was under the impression that it was three but I could be wrong). Unfortunately the only apartment that he could get was across the street from a elementary school. This alone tests Walter and his inner demons. Real-life spouse Kyra Sedgewick puts in a equally wonderful performance as Walter's girlfriend/co-worker Vickie. Despite knowing Walter's past, she still wants to be with him and eventually opens up to him about her troubled past.The cameo appearances by Eve, Mos Def, David Alan Grier, and Benjamin Bratt were excellent. I wish that there was a bit more of David Alan Grier as Walter's boss but otherwise their presence in the film were just as compelling as the lead characters. I wasn't too impressed by the cameo appearance by Madonna's ex-boyfriend Carlos Leon as Pedro. His acting abilities is something to be left desired. The stand out performance by the following actors had to be Mos Def. Mos Def's performance as Sgt. Javert who is constantly up Walter's grill, especially when something bad happens in the neighborhood.I have to give major points to director Nicole Kassell for tackling a very uncomfortable, if not ugly subject which is pedophilia. The subject matter is definitely not for the squeamish. The cinematography was very gritty which matched well with the subject. The way the film was edited was excellent and conveyed to this moviegoer the torment that Walter was experiencing.My only flaw I found with the film is the way that Walter's past was handled. I did not like being given snippets of a young girl and the red rubber ball that I used to play dodgeball with in elementary school. I understood that it was part of Walter's past but I think I would have liked to have known a little more or had just left it out altogether.The best qualities about this film is how Nicole treated her lead characters Walter and Vickie. They were flawed, wounded souls to say the very least but at the same time they were human and trying to make their way through life . By all means, Nicole certainly doesn't paint pedophilia in a positive light. She makes it very clear that pedohpilia is wrong but she at the same time wants to show the moviegoer what a convicted pedophilia goes through when he is re-integrated with society after serving prison time. It ain't a pretty picture but it certainly gave me some insight to what a convicted child molester goes through in society.After Kevin's stunning performance in 2003's ""Mystic River"", I didn't think he could put in an even better performance but he did here in ""The Woodsman"". Like wine, Kevin Bacon just keeps getting better and better with age.",The Woodsman
900298,"with few peers. This is one of the greatest films of all time.The other review about coldness here is pretty hilarious. Bresson's early Notes on Cinematography points in this direction: an attack on the dramatic. It's why he doesn't use actors. The question is, though, if this film is so cold, how come it would take a catatonic to avoid feeling wretchedly spent when it's over? Perhaps part of the answer is that the warmer, hammy dramatic approach is the easy way. This is an exercise in testing your flinch reflexes. And seeing if you can feel without having to understand. Accusing Bresson of being polemical (or didactic) is so far off base it's scary. As perhaps no one else, he plods forward with few devices and yet manages to wager devastating effect.",N/A
852831,"Not having seen anything but ""Gozu"" in what I've read is an illustrious catalogue by filmmaker Takasha Miike, I can't judge him solely on the strengths and weaknesses of this film in particular.  It was a wild, riveting ride, with some unforgettable scenes (particularly the opening, in which a slowly deteriorating member of the Yakuza crime family murders a puppy in the belief that it is a ""Yakuza attack dog"", and of course the queasy ""rebirth"" scene of that very same gangster at the film's conclusion), and at times reminds one of a Beckett play (the man with the pigment problem reclining in the field with a magazine, the innkeeper whipping her husband to generate ""spirits"", etc) a Lynch film (characters changing identities, gender bending, scenes of the most cartoonish sexual debauchery), and Monty Python all at once.  The problem, though, is that none of this means anything.  Unlike Lynch or Beckett we can find no discernible meaning, not even with the most circumspect viewing, simply because there is none.While I love surrealism, a movie does need to be more than the sum of it's parts, and ""Gozu"", for all it's nail biting scenes and undeniably menacing atmosphere, is only that.  A member of the Yakuza family named Ozaki is killed as he is about to commit a random of madness by Minami, a friend indebted to him forever for saving his life.From here everything goes wacky, and not in an unpleasant manner entirely: his corpse disappears from Minami's car.  There are strong elements of Hitchcock here, too, but from this point in the film nothing really makes any sense, even in retrospect.  We see a host of bizarre and stomach churning things: an inkeeper who likes to squirt her own milk rather than buy it from the store, handicapped Japanese people screaming about whether the day was hot or not.  Meanwhile our protagonist is taken on a journey that is imaginative and surreal but, in the end, all smoke.In the film essay Miike cites the influence, which is obvious anyway, of David Lynch films like ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive"".  There are definitely similarities.  In those movies, though, as strange and dreamlike as they are, there is an ultimate explanation, or host of explanations, for why things have happened this way.  Not all Lynch films have an ""ultimate point"", but those two did, and ""Gozu"" most certainly does not.  This is more than enjoyable, don't get me wrong; in fact, for people of certain tastes, including my own, I'd recommend it.  But don't expect a puzzle or anything to think extensively about.",Gozu

336421,"Crossroads have long held a special significance in occult lore. They are places where there's no North or South, no East or West. They are stillpoints in the fabric of time where ""things happen."" Things usually associated with the darkside of the spiritual spectrum. In otherwords, places to encounter the Devil.Just such a crossroads happens to be the ultimate destination of Eugene Martone (Ralph Macchio) a young and gifted classical guitarist attending the Julliard School of the Arts. Though classically trained, Eugene is obsessed with the music of the legendary bluesman Robert Johnson. He is also quite familiar with the superstitious beliefs associated with the engimatic Johnson. Some say he sold his soul to the Devil at some unspecified Mississippi crossroads in return for musical talent. Eugene dismisses such tales as nothing more than urban legend. However one tale he doesn't dismiss is the belief that Robert Johnson had one more song that was never recorded. Eugene is determined to find that lost song.In hopes of locating it Eugene enlists the help of Willie Brown (Joe Seneca), an old blues musician and probably the last living friend of Robert Johnson. Willie, now confined to a convalescent home in New York, promises to lead Eugene to the missing song if he helps him escape from the home and accompanies him back to Mississippi. Sneaking away at the first opportunity they spend the few dollars they have between them for tickets on a southbound bus. Thus the adventure begins.As they walk and hitchhike their way across the rural southern landscape, Willie begins to teach Eugene the essentials that must be experienced firsthand by anyone aspiring to be a true bluesman, such as; the hardships of life on the road and the loss of first love (love interest played by Jami Gertz). However the most important lesson turns out to be one Eugene would have never suspected. It's the truth concerning the crossroads. The story of Robert Johnson selling his soul to the Devil at the crossroads turns out to be fact, not fiction. It also turns out to be true for poor old Willie Brown.The real reason for Willie's desire to return to Mississippi is to attempt to win back his soul before it's too late. A feat that can only be accomplished with the help of Eugene and his guitar. Now Eugene must defeat the Devil's chosen guitarist Jack Butler (Steve Vai) in a musical challenge, or Willie and Eugene's souls will be lost forever.This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again. Ralph Macchio gives a strong performance but the real stars are Joe Seneca and Steve Vai. The final competition between Macchio and Vai still gives me goosebumps everytime I watch it!",N/A

27391,"I am biased, I'll tell you that up front. Kurosawa is my favorite director. Even if he were not, I would still love this film.Takashi Shimura (the head samurai in Seven Samurai)plays an alcoholic doctor in a dumpy urban part of post-war Japan.Toshiro Mifune plays a small-time gangster who initially visits the doctor regarding a bullet wound. The doctor discovers that the gangster also has tuberculosis, and stubbornly tries to treat it. I say stubbornly because the gangster tries to act macho about the disease. The two charactors are both so strongly portrayed that the doctor's attempt to treat the disease and the gangster's faked but desperate non-chalance makes their relationship a struggle; at times they actually come to blows over the doctor's persistence. The doctor , I think, sees some of himself in the gangster; someone on the edge of society, someone with flaws, someone with unfulfilled dreams. The doctor wants the gangster to survive, and the gangster desperately wants to survive, but his ""toughness"" keeps him from admitting that he wants to live.In any event, my wife and I fall in love with the doctor everytime we see this film. He is the better angel of our  nature, scolding and caring. Watch the film; you too will fall in love with it.Criterion, please make it into a DVD!",Drunken Angel VHS
104612,"Frankenstein's last few failures must have really pissed him off, coz in this film Frankenstein is just plain wicked.  Sure, he's always been obsessed, mad, and at times, homicidal, but in this film he's just cold blooded through and through.  This goes to show how good of an actor Cushing is because he can play this to the friggin hilt!  It was always difficult not to like Frankenstein even if he was doing something evil coz Cushing was so charming.  This is the first time you'll be rooting for everyone else in the film to stop him.  I loved this change in the series.  It kinda makes sense too that the doctor would get worse and worse as the years go by.  He even rapes a woman!  Cushing raping a woman??  Never before could you imagine the man even thinking about sex, let alone indulging in it!  Considering the film was done in 69, the gore is upped a little as well, and that's fine and dandy with me.  The plot revolves around Cushing blackmailing a young couple to help him breakout an old colleague of his so he can learn once and for all how to successfully transplant a brain.  There really isn't a ""monster"" this time around, just a doctor with a new body.  You're instantly on this doctor's side too coz he's a cool guy(played by the great character actor Freddie Jones).  The ""monster"" of the film is definately Frankenstein himself.  Watching this, you get the idea that this was intended to be the last of the Hammer series, but worry not!  Hammer managed two more Frankenstein flicks, one with Cushing and one without.  I'd personally say Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is without a doubt one of the very best of the series.",Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed VHS
678632,"I am not usually a fan of the 'gentler genre', but The Man Who Cried is an extraordinary tale of pre-war life and love.  Little Fegele is sent away by her father to go to America where she will be safe, but Fegele winds out in England instead, where she is renamed Suzie and raised as English instead of the Russian Jew that she is.  Suzie (Christina Ricci) remembers her father singing, and when she comes of age, she leaves for Paris to be near the theaters.She meets Lola (Cate Blanchett) and the two girls decide to room together.  They are friends, though watching them is like looking at night and day.  Performing in the theater where they work is opera singer Dante Dominio (John Turturro), with a beautiful voice and a considerable ego.  Lola takes up with Dante, much to Suzie's dismay, about the same time Suzie becomes interested in the gypsies that perform along with the theater.Enter Cesar (Johnny Depp), who plays roles in the theater's performances with his gorgeous white horse.  Suzie is drawn to him, the feeling very clear that it is not just Cesar's smoldering good looks but a sense of affinity with him that calls to her, both of them being outcasts in some way.  What follows are a couple of 'Hello Vicar' sensually passionate scenes between Ricci and Depp (Yowza!) as they find love with each other.But pre-war France was a dangerous place for Jews, and when the jealous Dante exposes Suzie, which infuriates the gold-digging Lola enough to leave him, Suzie must say goodbye to Cesar and travel on to America to try and find her father.'The Man Who Cried' is a very pretty movie, not deep in plot but visually moving, truly a piece of cinematic eye-candy.  The photography and the brilliant acting by Ricci, Depp, Blanchett, and Turturro carry this movie all the way to five stars.  The soundtrack to the movie is wonderful, with some very moving operatic pieces that enhance the overall feel of the film.  Taking its place as a sleepy, dramatic movie with no real action, 'The Man Who Cried' still made a powerful impact on me, though I don't usually pick up movies of this genre.  Yes, it's that good, definitely a 'buy to own' rather than 'rent' DVD.  Enjoy!",N/A
853205,"This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen: not only does it avoid degenerating into a formula - with one of the principal characters killed off at the beginning - but it adds to the depth of all the players' characters. Bourne is still evolving in Damon's hands, becoming a new person from the confused automaton that he was in the first film, someone you can believe in and allow to enter your imagination. Of course, there are phenomenal action scenes, filmed in a you-are-there jerkiness, that reach new heights of realism in action film. (Interestingly, the director refused to use any computer animation, as he rightly knew the audience would recognise it as such.)But it is Damon who truly impresses: he adds creative twists to his characters like only a truly great actor can, carrying an entire environment with him you can identify with and believe, a genuine consciousness that the viewer can envision and empathise with. I would say he is this generation's Gene Hackman, a star who rises not on simple sex appeal but on outstanding acting talent. I would watch any film he is in.Warmly recommended. Let's hope they stop here, while the quality is maintained.",N/A
633588,"In many ways this is a predictable movie and is somewhat cliche'-ridden, but there are enough redeeming qualities throughout that make this film worthwhile.Joan Allen is a great actress and never disappoints, especially in this film. Kevin Costner is kind of surprising, not necessarily in the character he portrays, an ex-pro baseball player, which isn't exactly a stretch for him since he's done a few similar roles before, but what's really different about it is how he approaches this retired, burned out, introspective middle-aged man.I enjoyed the film because it's a very humanistic story, and I felt that Costner was drawing from personal experience in his portrayal which is probably why it was so believable. Joan Allen on the other hand is also very real, flesh and blood, desperate woman going through a flood of emotions after she believes her husband ran off with his Swedish secretary to Sweden, and she's left to pick up the pieces along with their four daughters. Her family is affluent of upper pedigree, well-mannered and sophisticated but of course that kind of becomes a facade that crashes down all around her as her young daughters rebel in their own ways, perhaps blaming their mom on a subconscious level for their dad leaving them.The daughters could have been further developed and were left slightly two-dimensional, but that was because the story focused mostly on the relationship between the angry, grieving mom and her rushed love affair with the radio DJ, ex-baseball pro. Joan Allen's character finds solace in him because for one he's there as a trusting, friendly and witty neighbor who gradually wins over the hearts of her daughters, but also because he's just a good guy, he's the calm in her storm and helps bring some rationale to her chaotic existence. The radio DJ takes on the role of a surrogate father but also as the ""cool adult"", which helps win over the heart of the mom.Despite the focus on the relationship between Costner and Allen, the audience gets to know the youngest daughter fairly well, as well as the second oldest. The youngest sibling is a bit of a paradox, she's constantly dismissed as an ignorant and inexperienced child but ends up displaying incredible maturity and wisdom by the end of the film. The 2nd oldest is misunderstood and doesn't get the respect she deserves from her mom because she studied interpretive dancing, an art form her mom doesn't understand, therefore doesn't respect. There's an important lesson to be learned there by not only the mother, but also people who watch the film, which is that there is more to life to be appreciated than what is within the limited scope of an individual's experiences, and even though this film might not delve too deeply into this concept, it deals with it in a respectful and moving manner that makes one think twice about things we might be unfamiliar with or not fully understand, and might end up appreciating once exposed to the beauty one facet of the human experience.Most of the cliche'd moments occur at the dinner table and involve stereotypical moments between the mom and daughters, and the in-jokes that they laugh at, which is kind of a standard for films like this, but it doesn't really hurt the film too much. I suppose it would have been more effective had the audience gotten to know all 4 girls as well as the mom.There are several sub-plots that happen simultaneously, but they aren't quite as important and serve more as a distraction than an exploration of this family's troubles of coping with a broken home. Several moments of genuine joy and sadness make this movie a soulful, moving experience and has one of the best endings I've seen in a movie.I fully recommend this film to anyone, and even though this type of film is considered to be a chick flick by most, don't let that scare you away, because it's worth watching and just might give people a better view of one's own family or even others and how perfect a family may seem, everybody has their problems, so it definitely promotes tolerance and understanding, and that's never a bad thing. There are a few surprises in the film that are quite clever. Overall a solid film and a refreshing change of pace from most Hollywood fare.",Upside of Anger (DVD) (WS)

When they discover that the shuttlecraft is an identical match to a shuttlecraft that is already in the shuttlebay, they discover an somewhat identical Captain Picard. The reason was that the Enterprise had attacked by a vortex that was also attacking Picard himself. Which led him to the conclusion that the vortex would leave the Enterprise alone, if he left the ship. It turned out that the Enterprise would be destroyed and the shuttlecraft with the past captain then was hit with an amazing force and sent hurdling through time.

I must say, I simply don't understand how they could think so, but what I've noticed about the people who don't like this film is that they simply don't enjoy dramatic cinema.

884794,"This exceptional film is entirely unique in its intensity and depth, but not how I expected. The priestly molestation is rather matter-of-fact, and not dramatized to the extreme as so many movies have done of late. The sex & nudity is very carefully placed, not at all gratuitous (unfortunately-more would have been welcomed albeit unnecessary for the story). In fact I can not tell why this version is NC-17, have Americans really become That Victorian?Much has been written about the story, what I didn't know prior to viewing was the intensity of plot twists and turns. I won't spoil any secrets here, but suffice it to say that it isn't even the secrets that are so intense, it is the masterful way in which things are revealed. This is really a film about sex as power, and all of the power plays which don't make anyone happy.Almodovar's direction and cinematography are stunning, erotic, and intensley emotional. He tells so much of the story visually without dialogue. What a treat.The film ends on a realistic note. There are no firey car crashes, no earth-shattering explosions, no full-frontal nudity, none of the usual supects, but this film sneaks up on you, shakes you to your being, and as you are drawn in by the sensuality and drama, the film demonstrates that life isn't fair, kind, or even very pretty sometimes.",Bad Education
252021,"Recently, I decided to rent all of Cameron Crowe's films and watch them.  I already owned ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (okay, he didn't direct it, but he wrote it) and ""Jerry Maguire"", so next I rented ""Say Anything ..."".""Say Anything ..."" begins with Lloyd Dobler, a kind, well-liked underachiever who falls in love with Diane Court, a straight-A student who has just been accepted into a college in England.  Lloyd wins Diane's affections after he takes her to a late-night party - but winning the approval of her father is a completely different matter.Cameron Crowe is certainly a talented filmmaker.  ""Say Anything ..."" was his directorial debut and third screenplay.  It's one of those special 80's teen romantic comedies that is even more magical today than it was back in '89.  As is typical with Cameron Crowe's films, ""Say Anything"" has a terrific soundtrack.  The film also has a sort of laid-back, observational style of directing, with mixes well with the intelligent, funny script.The casting is superb.  John Cusack is - well, awesome as Lloyd Dobler.  Ione Skye does a fine job of showing the confliction that Diane feels.  And John Mahoney is perfect as Diane's loving, protective father.The film has some great scenes.  The second ""In Your Eyes"" scene is definitely one of the movie's greatest and most famous moments.  Anyone who's seen the film will attest to the fact that it's a very memorable movie.  And it has a great ending too!""Say Anything ..."" is a marvelous movie, and definitely one of my favorites.  It's well-written, -acted and -directed.  It's moving, dramatic, and very funny.

630458,"""Friday Night Lights"" is a great movie. Not in terms of what happens, or how it happens, but in terms of acting and story line. The movie starts off promisingly enough, and it starts to live up to expectations. Not soon after that, though, the movie starts to drag in parts. Normally this is not problem. All movies do this. From great movies like ""Garden State"" (in the scene where they bury the hamster) and terrible movies like ""I, Robot"" (the entire first half). But with this movie it doesn't just drag for a minute or two. It drags...and drags...and drags for about ten minutes. There are aspects of the movie that are left unexplained, like that one kid's mother. All throughout the movie, people keep going up to him and asking ""How's yer mom doing?"" and he either says fine or she'll be dying soon. For a while in the second half, we are led to believe she has terrets syndrome when she starts shouting and cursing at her TV screen. But that wouldn't cause her to be sick, is the thing. We all have some form of terrets. When we get mad...when Carl's Jr. puts out more of those ""dumb guy"" commercials, or when they outlaw those Paris Hilton ones. There are other parts of the movie that are nauseating, in all senses. This could be a perfectly good adult sports drama, but, alas, the movie had to appeal to teenagers by adding constant references to ""getting laid"" and doing drugs. Another thing that made me want to vomit was the camera work. It's not that it wasn't good, it was great, it was just a little too pretensious. The handheld camera technique worked in ""Snatch"", but not here. The picture comes off herky jerky and a little ugly. But, there are many more great aspects about the movie than there are bad. The acting is great, and some of the football scenes are truly intense, especially the last one, even though we all know what will happen. The end is one thing that brings this movie down from five star level. As we all think the team will win and we get ourselves geared up for it, they end up losing. I guess it is my fault because I didn't know the end already, but it was still a major let down. Director Peter Berg is much better at staging the more subdued scenes, such as two character talking. He falters, however, in scenes of cringe inducing sports violence that just make the movie a little better, yet a little harder to watch. Berg does stage one hilarious scene in a parking lot of the local drug store involving star Billy Bob Thorton, his wife and his daughter. This is not a suprise, since Berg's past credits include ""The Rundown"", and action-comedy, and ""Very Bad Things"", a very dark comedy. ""Friday Night Lights"" is an interesting drama, but there are a few too many scenes that try to be serious but instead are funny. Names of characters, like my good friend Boobie Miles, will cause laughs between pre-teens 10-12, probably. This is not a great movie, or at times even a good one, but it gets the job done in an entertaining, efficient way. It will appeal mostly to sports jocks, and maybe to their unfortunate girlfriends, wives, or significant others that they drag to this movie. I usually like any kind of movie, and I also assumed that I would like this one. I saw the first ""Bridget Jones"" the same day as I saw ""Collateral"" and loved them both. I thought that I may as well give this a try, even if the previews didn't make it look to great. While this movie is better than something like ""Hoosiers"", it's not as good as, say, ""Million Dollar Baby"". The ending of this one will leave you in the same, dark place that ""M$B"" left you, and it isn't sugar coated and cutsey like ""Hoosiers"" was. At times, ""Friday Night Lights"" takes itself a little too seriously. Scenes where the team practices feel like comic relief from the serious and stressfull other points of the movie. When a character cries, the acting in that scene is so overdone that one can't help but laugh.Thortan plays coach Gary Gaines, who has recently moved to Odessa, Texas to escape his losing streak. He starts the season anew, and he is hopeful with his many new players. Some, like Boobie (Derek Luke), are overly pompus. Others, like Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), are abuses at home. Don is abused by his father, Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw), who used to play for the same team as Don is now playing on. Charles wants Don to be what he could never be: great. Don resents him for that, and as a result, Charles gets drunk and yells at and hits him alot. Gaines teaches the kids how to respect their fellow teammates, and the movie follows that same old cliche ridden script. The team plays through the semi-finals, the finals, and finally makes it to the championship. This happens over a two hour five minute time span, and at times the movie feels overlong. It feels about 20 minutes too long. Usually, sports movies use their time wisely, there fore they are never that long. This particular film wastes some time (45 minutes or so) detailing how the players live, yet oddly, the characters are incredibly underdeveloped.The movie takes a true story and spins it into a slightly fictional tale, one that makes it not more interesting, but more eccentric, in a strange way. The characters are never fully developed, and as the movie progresses we keep thinking that they will be developed more, or at least in fuller detail. Unfortunately, that never happens, and we are left on our own to figure something out about these characters. Not every single one is not developed. Gaines, Boobie, Charles, Don, and Gaines' wife are all fully developed. That will have to do, though, since nothing else in the movie, or anyone else for that matter, is explained that well. This movie is a dissapointment because it could have been so much more. So much more dramtic, so much more funny, so much more game oriented. Oh. Sorry. The movie is game oriented, and fatally so. The film, after a while, begins to feel like a bunch of different games and practices strung together with placement titles on the bottom of the screen. It probably feels like this because the movie really is just a bunch of games and practices after a while. ""Friday Night Lights"" shows just how obsessed this town is with its games, and it does it well with montages of stores with signs that read ""Gone To The Game"", and how it shows the packed stadiums is truly breathtaking. ""Friday Night Lights"" is well done in so many ways. Too many to mention. But it is also fatally flawed in just as many ways. Sad, in a way, since this movie had real potential. Real, genuine, special potential that it squanders mostly in its last half hour. Sorry Billy Bob, you were better in ""Bad Santa"".",Friday Night Lights
627176,"Inspired by stories about the Knights Templar and the Masons, a fanciful tale about a long-lost treasure spanning centuries of history was created for the 2004 film ""National Treasure"".  Directed by Jon Turteltaub (who directed ""Phenomenon"" in 1996), the film suggests that the original Declaration of Independence contains a hidden map to the mythical treasure that was allegedly hidden by various Founding Fathers (including Benjamin Franklin) to prevent it from falling into British hands during the Revolutionary War.  Knowledge of the mythical treasure had been passed down through several generations of the Gates family until it reached the ears of Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) when he was a boy.  Ben spends most of his adult life searching for the only key to the treasure that he knows about: something called Charlotte.  With help from the unscrupulous Ian Howe (Sean Bean), Ben finds the Charlotte and discovers another key to the treasure that leads him (and Ian) to the Declaration of Independence, which is under the watchful care of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger).  Hoping to beat Ian to the Declaration, Ben is assisted by Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) to try and steal it from the National Archives in Washington, D.C., in order to save it from Ian, who would not be inclined to not harm the precious 200-year-old document.  With a lot of suspense and chasing, Ben and Riley succeed with the unintended help from Abigail.  The Declaration does indeed hold some hidden information, but instead of being a map, it holds another set of clues in finding the treasure that include a set of old letters that Ben's father, Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), has in his possession.  Naturally, upon stealing the Declaration, the FBI gets involved and Ian is still determined to get the treasure before Ben can.  Will Ben be able to solve the mystery or will Ian or the FBI stand in his way?  You'll just have to watch this entertaining film to find out.The legends about the Knights Templar once having a huge treasure, as well as mysteries surrounding the Free Masons, were a good premise for creating the plot for ""National Treasure"".  With a mix of suspense, good special effects and interesting characters, the film works sufficiently well to keep most of the audience engaged throughout its 131 minutes.  Hence, overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  The DVD also includes deleted scenes, cryptography games and background documentary information.  Other interesting characters include FBI agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel) and Ben's grandfather John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer).",National Treasure
627064,"They say the ONLY thing in life that is certain is death and taxes, right?  I submit a third certainty to this list: if the critics hate it, without a doubt I am going to LOVE IT.  Why?  I'm not quite certain, but it just seems to be the case virtually ALL the time (at least with me anyway).First off, National Treasure probably would not have been made if not for the phenomenal success of The Da Vinci Code.  The similarities are too close to be a coincidence.  The success of BOTH however is NO accident.  It is rare that I go to the movies looking for an opportunity to increase my intellect.  I generally go to have FUN and escape from the real world for a while, same reason why I take my family to Disneyland, I just hope to escape and enjoy myself.  I have no doubt in my mind if The Da Vinci Code had not have been printed, this movie would simply not exist...I suppose I could be wrong, but I'm willing to wager I'm not.  Either way, WHO CARES?  For all the same reasons why Dan Brown's novel is so entertaining, National Treasure places that energy and love of history onto the big screen and for the most part, the payoff is well worth it.FORGET how plausible the film is.  When was the last time you saw a Hollywood blockbuster movie and came away believing ANY of it?  This film was meant for entertainment, pure and simple.  For those who cannot enjoy anything without dissecting every scene and annoyingly break it apart frame by frame, well this movie was definitely NOT made for them.  There is a great portion of this movie which is simply impossible to believe, yet the vast majority of those who saw this movie enjoyed it anyway because the Producers seemed to catch the vision of what the movie was all about and set out to simply have some genuine fun along the way, and the results?  Well the results tend to be a tremendously popular film which earns a boatload of money and screams for a sequel.  Part of me would LOVE one, but I also have to remind myself just how often Hollywood literally ruins sequels.  Maybe I'd rather just enjoy the one unless they can at the very least do another one AS good as the original...but I'm not going to hold my breath.Let me also say that despite the fact that I have enjoyed many films with Nicolas Cage, I have never really enjoyed him in particular and kind of always felt he was viewed as being a lot better than he really was -- at least to me...but I must admit this movie really changed my mind, much like how Ghost made me appreciate Whoopie Goldberg after disliking literally everything she had made up to that point.  I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie was perfectly cast, but they certainly did a good job.  The storyline and the pacing were done virtually to perfection and the added DVD bonuses actually ARE quite interesting and unlike so many so-called *extras* you see on these discs, this one actually has a couple of VERY cool items which are quite informative and entertaining at the same time.  It is tough these days to single a movie out amidst all of the riff-raff hitting the video-store shelves these days, but National Treasure will work its way to the front simply because when you get right down to it, most of us really enjoy a fun and entertaining thrill ride which makes us feel good along the way.  Oh yeah, and don't forget, if the critics hate it, it simply MUST be good.",National Treasure

Geraldine Page deserved her Oscar. Incidently, have the opening credits been redone...looks like video vs the rest of the film.",Trip to Bountiful VHS
467621,"Although he designed and directed a number of notable films, today William Cameron Menzies is best recalled as the director of the &#34;so bad it's good&#34; 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS. His work with the 1951 DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH might be considered a build up to that ham-fisted style, for it has the same flatness. Sad to say, it has none of the same fun.The story concerns a Confederate effort to thwart Sherman's advance on Atlanta. Strange to say, however, Georgia seems to have been transplanted to the wild west for purposes of the film, which comes complete with a mesa on which the Confederates desire to plant their cannon and fire upon the railroad below. Throw in a love triangle and some of the most uninspired acting you can obtain and you have DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH.Today the film is best recalled for the presence of actress Barbara Payton (1927-1967), a performer who trembled on the brink of stardom in the late 1940s and early 1950s before she self-destructed in a hog-wallow of sex, booze, drugs, and front page scandal. It is easy to see what the fuss was about: she has a dead-pan sexuality, larger-than-life beauty, and memorable speaking voice. Unfortunately, none of these qualities have much to do with either film or role, and even her cult-status can't make up for what is basically a remarkably shallow, incredibly silly, and deadly dull film.Unless you are desperate to see what Payton looked like on the screen before she ended up as a five dollar hooker working the Sunset Strip, DRUMS ALONG THE DEEP SOUTH is a film to avoid at all costs. Treat it as you would the plague.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",N/A
