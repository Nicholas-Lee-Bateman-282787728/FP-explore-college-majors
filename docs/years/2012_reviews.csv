1473372,"Although this film is Not your Original Disney Classic that we all love and cherish, this movie is a Gem in itself. It entertains from start to finish, will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes, and has its own mystical-magic. It is presented as the 2012 dark and powerful fantasy version. A standalone indeed with dazzling magic, unstoppable action, and enough portions of both evil and innocence. Among the gnomes, dwarfs, giant trolls and fairies, there is much more to ponder. The acting roles of Charlise Theron, Kristen Stewart, and Chris Hemsworth were Excellent in Performance, and Amazing. The viewer of course feels sorry for the Huntsman, but he does find hope. We praise Snow White in all her beauty, purity, and innocence. Last but not least, we usually don't have much compassion for the dark and powerful Wicked Queen. This movie is Enjoyable as the Magic comes to life! Highly recommended for adventure and fantasy lovers, who like magical-mystical stories filled with action.",N/A
1465009,"The Chronicle creators (writer Max Landis, Director Josh Trank) have cleverly melded three common plot devices used individually for multiple other films: finding a mysterious object that affects characters (Green Lantern, etc.), the achievement of super powers through circumstance (Fantastic Four, etc.), and telekinesis (Zapped, Firestarter, Carrie, Phenomenon, Push, etc.).In this hodge-podge, three unlikely friends - Andrew (DeHaan), Matt (Russell), Steve (Jordan) - find themselves with amazing powers, abilities that at first are used for fun and pranks but later turn to darker purposes.  Thought of as a muscle to be strengthened, the powers develop as the trio experiment more and more.  They soon find out, however, that excessive or strenuous use causes nosebleeds.  What's more, they learn the powers are dangerous when the fun and games end.Filmed primarily through a hand-held camera, Chronicle manages to embrace newer techniques and fresh perspective without causing epileptic seizures (looking at you, Cloverfield).  Driven by Andrew's desire to document everything he's experiencing in life, in high school, at home with his drunken father, the hand-held camera holds purpose but is somewhat superfluous.  Especially since later scenes exploit the superpower angle to use the handheld camera at lengths far enough away to fully grasp scenes with action.  Very rarely do I truly enjoy this style of filmmaking, but the usage is sparse enough and unique enough to transcend inherent flaws.Despite the recycled troubled teenagers angle and tired lessons about the dangers of power, the script is crisp.  Dialogue is witty, engaging, and realistic.  Like teens of today talk.  Not at all a forced hip, unrealistic, inauthentic, or self righteous like everything Diablo Cody writes.  Each member of the young cast shows talent, making the most of their lines at least enough to convince viewers of their status on the High School food chain.Overall the effort is exciting and enticing, enough to draw in viewers emotionally while still providing enough FX action to terrorize the Seattle landscape with familiar yet fresh mutant vs. mortal X-Men themes.  This film soars high and overdelivers the entire time.",Chronicle
565917,"This 1972 American International Pictures (AIP) production is low budget, with stock footage obvious at times. Continuity/consistency issues might be annoying to some viewers; Slaughter's marksmanship, for example, goes from lousy point shooting tecnhique (punching his hand toward the target) to barely missing a baddie in the unnamed South American country. (It was Mexico, obviously, but the production was not allowed to name it because of the host's fears of negative tourism publicity.)Decent soundtrack, though it doesn't live up to themain theme. The interracial love scenes were landmark. Career buddy-cop Don Gordon (Bullitt) does light duty here, but beady-eyed Rip Torn was sleazy and downright homicidal: a worthy adversary. Jim Brown seems much tougher here than he did a year later inSlaughter's Big Ripoff. Better still are strong blacksploitation entries such asShaft,Black Caesar,Truck Turner, andFoxy Brown.Genre rating: 3 stars",Slaughter

1429013,"THE DESCENDANTS, though highly praised, could have been a lot better.  I am astonished that George Clooney was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, which consisted largely of running around looking tense or yelling at his teenaged daughters.  The plot was hopeful -- Clooney's character is part of a large clan that dates back to Hawaiian royal forbears and whose last big tract of virgin property must be sold or face bankruptcy, putting Clooney, as administrator, in a family fracas; and meanwhile he must face the fact that his comatose wife had been having an affair with a local man.  But not enough was done of this and at times when the film could really have dug in and had something to say, it grounds out in facile comedy instead.  While the film has its merits, including a wonderful turn by Beau Bridges as a dissolute clan member and excellent performances by the young actresses playing Clooney's daughters, the film is ultimately something of a fizzle--""Haole (white) as s--t"" says Clooney's character of his family's lifestyle at one point, and too much of that characterizes THE DESCENDANTS the movie as well.",The Descendants

419639,"This extemely unorthodox film really hits hard and forces the viewer to ask many of life's deepest and most painful questions. Frankenheimer & Rock Hudson score a gigantic artistic success with the film; unfortunately financial success proved elusive and the film has languished in obscurity for over 4 decades now. Having just completed a trilogy of very commercially successful light comedies with Doris Day, Hudson was seeking the right vehicle to allow him to explore new genres. He found the right vehicle with Seconds, and turned in the best performance of his career. His acting in the final scene is so intense that it is actually difficult to watch.It is rather ironic that Rock Hudson plays a man who's true identity is not who he appears to be, as this is the exact way Rock Hudson lived his life in Hollywood. An extemely handsome and talented actor, his public persona as a manly screen heart throb was forged by the studios and and bore little or no resemblance to the man he was in private.Seconds demands each of us to take that painful self-test to find out if we are truly happy or not. How is happiness and satisfaction found?.... Sex? Good looks? Career? The protagonist fakes his death, and then is ""reborn"" into a new life with a new face, new body, new career, and new friends. Yet the happiness he seeks somehow still eludes him.We never really find out exactly why he is unhappy in his new life. At first I found this lack of insight disappointing, but then I figured that perhaps there really is no specific reason or circumstance causing his unhappiness. His character may be viewed as simply being unhappy in ""attitude""; he is not thankful for the things he has, but merely longs for the things he doesn't have. Upon personal relection, I feel perhaps rebirth is something spiritual (John 3:3) and not physical. Perhaps happiness is an attitude (1Thes 5:18) and is not based on our circumstances. Perhaps the void we feel inside cannot be filled by a new job, new friends, or sex (Eccl 5:10-12), because that void was not designed to be filled by those things.In closing, the film takes a long sharp look at the fantasy fascade that eludes most westerners. Seconds obliges each of us to take a spiritual inventory of our lives and the things we value and strive for. Please be aware that the film is extemely downbeat, and does not follow the archetypal format of: Boy Meets Girl/Boy Loses Girl/Boy Wins Girl Back. So if you are expecting a ""Doris Day"" type film, you best go rent ""Pillow Talk"". If you are looking for a deep & dark film, that is not afraid to go way outside the lines, then check this out! Be warned, the rated R version does contain some nudity (but curiously contains zero profanity or violence) and there are fun cameos by ""Grampa Walton"" from The Waltons and ""Oscar Goldman"" from the Six Million Dollar Man.",Seconds VHS

1456975,"I watched this movie last night after hearing all the hype and reading 1 star review after 1 star review. Sure, the core message parallels that of ""Natural Born Killers"": Western society/culture is destroying itself via the media & mass entertainment outlets. Thing is, the shocks are pretty much the only reason to watch it because the quality of everything but the prop, make-up, & art departments suffers due to a laughable script, so-so acting, a conventional music score & sound by the sound department (a few of the ""gross-out"" sounds worked though), and the lighting department did a so-so job. I'm a film buff/elitist, whatever you want to call it; I notice flaws and they bug me--that's just my taste & opinion.I know lots of people go for these types of horror flicks that are more concerned with the shock factor than the little things that add up to a well-made film; to each her/his own. Funny thing is, after the 1st few shocks I became desensitized towards the barrage of sickness, enough so that I began to find the film funny, like a blacker-than-black black comedy. The edge of realism they tried for turned into surrealism. That surrealistic feel surrounding the gore works against what (I believe)was the film-maker's goal: to have the movie as a whole be like a slice-of-life gone terribly wrong. Instead of making me feel genuine emotion towards the characters and their situations, that surrealistic edge gave me enough SAFE distance from them that I could step back from what I was seeing and think critically. If they could have found ways to remove that safety blanket between the gore scenes, so that I was tethered to the story enough to be unable to step back for a breather, I would've been deeply repulsed for the movies full duration instead of chuckling and shaking my head.The film-makers were obviously attempting to create a meaningful, realistic film with an important message, but due to the over-all lack of professionalism (exceptions to all involved in the amazing work with the gore)the movie goes from being a potentially important and artistic statement to falling flat as another typical shock flick that, while upping the ante on the limitations of pervasive gore, stays grounded as just another movie in the Netflix ""Horror"" genre because it, surprisingly enough, didn't take technical chances in how it was made to match the chances it took with the limits of gore. The script could've been helped greatly by running it through maybe 3-4 more drafts.All-in-all, ""A Serbian Film"" should be called ""A Serbian Movie"" or ""A Serbian Horror Flick"", because, unfortunately, those involved in its creation obviously placed all of the emphasis of their talents on the shock factor of the gore alone, versus putting in the time and effort to make the other aspects of the film stand tall with the blood & guts. A tripod falls down every time if it only has one leg fully telescoped. HOWEVER--if you get past the technical misfirings (if that sort of thing even bothers you at all)you'll probably appreciate this movie for the risks the people involved took (everybody whose name is attached to this movie will find their reputations forever changed, for better or worse);or, like me, you'll end up enjoying it as something outlandishly gross to watch a few times (don't see myself watching it more than once more on my own--too many better films to digest),or a ""shock token"" to show friends or bring to parties to witness the certain gross-out reactions. Hey, I can admit that it's FUN at least!",N/A

1494982,"Recently I watched the July 1986 Bregenzer Fest production conducted by Patane on the web, and by Jove, I like that one much more than this 2011 production, though also in Vienna!Viennesse audiences are probably too forgetful,especially the media, to hail this version as the best since Callas and Sutherland.Netrebko has more voice than Katia Ricciarelli in 1986 (a rather late period of the latter's career), but in termsm of vocal acting and drama, Katia is miles ahead of Anna.  Katia's singing is not only much more stylish (she has ALL then fiorature), her ability to shade phrases and bring out nuances are something that are so evidently superior to Netrebko's rather basic rendition.As for Seymour, Garanca is on par with Tocysz vocally, but notn dramatically.  Her Seymour is an rather insipid character, and it is difficult to figure out why Henry VIII would fall for her in Boleyn's stead.Nestrenko is, even if no longer in his vocal prime, a preferred King Henry over D'arcahgelo, who was ill in this performance, alas.The major difference between this and the Bregenz performance is the scene between Bolene and Percy.  In then Bregenz version, the Percy was portrayed ton great artistic height (not just vocal or muscial, but also dramatic) by Francisco Araiza, who sung all the high notes of the role without the slightest qualm, and gave the character of Percy such a colourful portrayal that really stands on full footing with the rest of Henry, Seymour and Boleyn, some thing that NO single tenor is capable of today!

1051416,"Warner Bros. always releases fantastic collection series, and the Warner Essential Classics always have some of the best films of all time on it, and it doesn't get any better than this! These are three among the best romances of all time.Gone With the Wind (1939)- 10/10- ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"" Easily in my top 10 favorite films of all time. One of the greatest romances, one of the greatest epics, and one of the greatest films of all time. The story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) amongst the backdrop of the Civil War is a classic, and is definitely one of the best stories of all time. In the film's 3 hours and 53 minutes, there isn't a dull moment. Every scene is phenomenal with the acting, the costumes, the color. Everything is perfect in this film. It's one of those films where it's so fantastic that words can't even describe. The 2-disc version on this set isn't the best quality, but it's still great.Special Features:Commentary by Historian Rudy BehlmerCasablanca (1942)- 10/10- While I do prefer ""Gone With the Wind"" more, I do truly believe ""Casablanca"" is the better romance film (After all it is considered the greatest romance film according to the American Film Institute). Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman have amazing chemistry as two lovers during WWII. The story of love and love lost is fantastic and the black-and-white cinematography intensifies it along with great direction from Michael Curtiz. It has one of the all-time great film endings and it's a film to remember. You'll want to ""play it"" again and again!

It has Omar Sharif, Geraldine Chaplin, and Julie Christie in a love triangle during the Russian Revolution. In the film's 3 1/2 hours, it's full of intensity, fantastic color, beautiful settings, amazing romance, memorable music including the score, and a truly great story. It's not as famous as GWTW or Casablanca, but it's one of the all-time great romance films that every classic film fan should see. Also, I must add that the remastering is top notch on the DVD.

The movie itself is a great period piece and though only loosely coupled with true facts of Poe's life, the movie is still an adventure ride and fun for all viewers (in my perspective). I thought Cusack did a great job as Poe and the mystery itself that unfolds is definitely spellbinding and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.On top of all of this, the bonus features on the Blu-ray are amazing and add much to your understanding of the movie itself.

273534,"They just don't make them like they used too. That certainly applies to this 1986 cult classic. A B movie that is in love with B movies and throws every genre into the mix and throws it up onto the screen. Fred Dekker's beloved cult film was finally released on DVD a few years ago, and it was worth the wait. Having finally gotten around to getting a copy, I can say that this is just one incredibly fun package.An alien experiment is let loose from a spaceship in outer space, the contents landing on earth in the 1950s (in what is unquestionably a fun, retro beginning of the movie filmed in glorious black and white). These slug like creatures inhabit a character from the 50s opening by jumping into his mouth. Quickly jumping to a present day (1986) college campus, we meet Chris and J.C. (Jason Lively, Steve Marshall), two buddies. Chris is in love with Cynthia, and J.C. trying to make the two a couple. Soon, the little ""creeps"" are unleashed upon the campus after Chris and J.C. unknowingly awaken the boy from the 1950s, who has been cryogenically frozen, and take over human bodies, turning them into walking zombies in the process. Helping out is Det. Ray Cameron (the awesome Tom Atkins), a hard boiled detective straight out of the old film noir mysteries. It is up to them to figure out how to stop the slimy wigglers and save mankind.There is a lot to love here. You get science fiction, horror, comedy, romance. Pretty much the entire kitchen sink is thrown in here and the film has fun with all of the genres. So will you. Director/writer Dekker is obviously having a ball creating this movie, and clearly has a love for all things movies. Where else will you find a skeletal ax murderer, zombie dogs, aliens, heads splitting open, and a detective with wonderful lines like ""No, Bullwinkle moose!"" when someone calls him by name? What's amazing is that Dekker and his cast and crew all make it come together and work. You don't question any of the styles merging together, or any of the story. You just accept it and go along with it because it's so fun and entertaining. A popcorn B movie if there ever was one. The look, tone, colors, and effects proudly claim ""This is an 80s movie!"", and thank god for it. There is no other decade this movie could of been, and it revels in all the 80s glory it can. Like I said earlier, they don't make 'em like they used too. As for the cast, It's Atkins' show. He chews up every scene he's in and he is the one you will remember long after the movie is over. Jason Lively is likeable, Steve Marshall as handicapped J.C. is a great friend, and Jill Whitlow is sweet and loveable. Definitely the kind of perfect 80s girl you would crush on.This special edition DVD is nicely put together. You get an hour long 'making of' featurette with 5 parts - ""Birth Of The Creeps"", ""Cast Of The Creeps"", ""Creating The Creeps"", ""Escape Of The Creeps"", and ""Legend Of The Creeps"". All of which are pretty self explanatory. There is a nearly 20 minute featurette on Atkins called ""Tom Atkins: Man Of Action"", which gives you a history and overlook on the man. Plus, there are 7 deleted scenes(which, more or less, were right to be deleted), a trivia track, 2 commentaries (one with Dekker and another with the cast), original theatrical ending(as this edition has the 'Director's Cut' ending), and the original theatrical trailer.All in all, this is quite a release for a little cult B movie from 1986. Fans will no doubt be pleased with this release. I know I was. Hopefully, ""Creeps"" will continue to grow and gain new fans. This release is sure a good way to do that. ""Night Of The Creeps"" is a lot of fun. It makes no bones about what it is, what it is trying to do, and succeeds. Det. Cameron always says 'Thrill me'. And yes, the movie does.",N/A

1507995,"Synopsis:  Bucky Larson (played by Nick Swardson) is a man-child living in rural Iowa who believes he is destined for better things after getting fired from his job at the local grocery store.  During a night of fooling around with his friends, he finds found that his reserved parents Jeremiah (Edward Hermann) and Debbie (Miriam Flynn) were popular and prolific porn stars during the 1970s.  Inspired, Bucky packs up his things and moves to Los Angeles, where he plans on continuing the family legacy.  Though he knows no one in Los Angeles, a waitress by the name of Kathy McGee (Christina Ricci) takes him under her wing and ensures that he sees to it that his dreams are fulfilled.  Under the pressure to get money for his new roommate Gary (Kevin Nealon), Bucky tries to get into the adult business, but is publicly humiliated by his lack of endowment by the over-endowed Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff).  This doesn't dissuade down-and-out porn producer Miles Deep (Don Johnson) from attempting to make a buck off Bucky and his family's reputation, however, so he offers to make Bucky Larson ""a star.""  Will Miles regret taking a gamble on Bucky?  Will Bucky Larson be a star?  And if so, will Kathy accept who he is for who he is and take their relationship to the next level?  Pauly Shore and Jimmy Fallon make cameo appearances.The premise is convoluted and it seems odd that everyone in Bucky's life is so nonchalant about his newfound choice of vocation. BThe movie followed a lot of the humor that the other Happy Madison films followed and the acting as a whole seemed rather weak.  Kevin Nealon is singlehandedly the reason why I would even consider watching this film again.  Had he not played the role of Gary, I could see myself enjoying this as much as I would have enjoyed a root canal.  I was expecting more with that kinda star power.Members of the 18-35 crowd who like to party while watching movies may find something worthwhile in watching this.  Anyone else, however, probably wouldn't enjoy it enough to watch, let alone own or rent.",N/A

1548294,"This very good film shocked me as few others did since ""Seven"", surprised me as few others did since the ""Usual suspects"" and in a couple of scenes also scared me (although ultimately it was not half as scary as I expected).The story happens in Cold Rock, a little half-abandoned town in the state of Washington, where for the last couple of years somebody or SOMETHING abducted seventeen little children, babies or toddlers. There never was a viable suspect and no bodies were ever found. Terrified local residents nick named the person or THING behind those appearances ""The Tall Man"". A local nurse, Julia Dening, will finally become extremely concerned by the question ""Who, or WHAT, is The Tall Man"". A mute young girl, Jenny (Jodelle Ferland), who is the only one to really have seen ""The Tall Man"" with her own eyes, holds maybe some clues to solve the riddle...This is a very clever, very surprising thriller which manages to preserve the suspense for a very long time. I managed to understand what is going on a little bit earlier than it was openly revealed, but still, it was only 10 minutes before the end...Actors are doing great. Jessica Biel is here excellent and as always extremely beautiful. Joelle Ferland proves once again her great talent - she will be a great star one day! William B. Davis, the ""Smoking Man"" from X-Files, plays the role of the local old and slightly hapless sheriff - or is he really so hapless? Stephen McHattie, a Canadian veteran actor, does a great job as a tenacious detective, Lieutenant Dodd (he is mostly known from second roles, but his threatening face is rather unforgettable...). Last but not least, there is Colleen Wheeler, who plays Ms. Johnson, a local crazy woman - Ms Johnson is a secondary but important character and Colleen Wheeler played her perfectly.I would advise to NOT read more detailed reviews or even watch the trailers, so you can go see this film like I did, without knowing anything else other than what we can guess from the poster at the cinema entry. The surprises are important and the director did all he could to give us lots of false clues to prevent the secret of being found too early.Now, if what you need is a classical horror, here you risk to be a little bit disappointed, because this film is... well, something different. As father of little children myself I must say that I was quite troubled by the whole story and GREATLY shocked and upset by the solution. But I am not giving any more clues. Enjoy the film and decide yourself what you think of it.",N/A

1502247,"Justice League: Doom is about the 50,000 year old man, Vandal Savage and his plan to wipe out a large part of the human race and put in his own social order.  But how to do that with the Justice League in the way?Unlike the ""Tower of Babel"" graphic novel [Jla: Tower of Babel - Vol 07  [JLA V07 JLA TOWER OF BABEL - V] [Paperback]] from which the film is based, the film concentrates more on the fighting between the JLA and their opposite numbers rather than the brooding Batman, though the Bats is prominent in most of the film.Some shockers that entertain: Bruce Wayne's parents' bodies are gone.  Bane gives him a sucker punch and locks him in a coffin with his long dead father.  Seems to me he got a lot of inspiration from that == beating his way out of the coffin was quite amazing.Batman has a contingency plan if the JLA ever got crazy and somehow the bad guys find out about it and using Vandal's technology get the data from the Batcave and then use it to put the League out of action.Several points that I liked, others I didn't:  How did the bad guys find that Batman had this file in the first place?  If it was revealed I missed it.  Wonder Woman is drugged to believe that she is fighting Cheetah,  many copies of her.  Now if the serum made WW believe this, then OK.  But at some point in the fighting would she not have realized that they were all fakes?  And when Cyborg came to her and explained it all and gave her an antidote, she still asks what happened.  Really?OK, now the parts I liked:  The amazing way Flash figures out how to beat on Mirror Master, a favorite of mine from the Silver Age of Comics.  Really great telling of Hal Jordan as he is convinced he killed people in a mine shaft and apparently has been there for hours clutching a dead body.  Still, a great piece of psychological torture thanks to the trickery of Star Sapphire.The other heroes have their own demons, but the above two were the most impressive.Bottom Line:  Got some great features in this two disc set, but the storyline and voice actors for Doom, though the plot thins at parts, is a valid entry into the DC Animated Universe.  Do buy!Voice Actors!  Claudia Black gave a British accent to Cheetah which I thought clever.

I received it as a preview copy to watch before it released.At first I saw the simple 3 man skit portraying in a jail that looked made out of paper mache, and a cityscape that was not the best CG...But then the story begins to unfold; the scripting and acting made you forget these above points.Yet what captured me was the scripting of the Last Supper.  In it is a scene that captured the beauty, the questions, and the depth of what Jesus was saying to his disciples.This scene has left me pondering... It brought a humanity to the Apostles; it brought to light the doubt that each and every one was dealing with.This scene still lives in me at this moment.Bruce Marchiano again plays Jesus in his real, and personal way that captures you as well.This is a 5 star movie!this is good for all over the age of 12.

1349323,"The Next Three Days is a movie full of suspense. It really kept me on the edge of my seat and that doesn't happen very often.Russell Crowe is absolutely brilliant as John Brennan the main character. The rest of the cast is also well chosen and their acting is great. The different characters are nicely developed, convincing and plausible. The dialogs are well written.There are many touching scenes where no words are spoken. It's just the acting and some background music which tell you more than any words could say. The soundtrack is also very well chosen. Layout and scenery of Pittsburgh play an essential part in the story line.The plot is very densely packed and fast-moving and consists of many small scenes. Some of the deleted scenes would have filled some gaps and provided the viewer with some helpful explanations. It's a pity that there is no extended version on the DVD. There are for example deleted scenes that would have explained how John Brennan came up with the plan to tamper with his wife's blood test to get her out of prison.The Next Three Days is definitely one of the best movies I have seen lately but nothing is perfect. You just can't push up the door knob of a car with a tennis ball. There would have been some other means like a device to intercept the door lock mechanism with remote control. John could have obtained such a device from the same shady neighborhood he got the passports from. I also didn't like the scene of Lara trying to throw herself out of the car just because John made a sudden change in plans. Why a second suicide attempt now when she is almost home free? A freaked out Lara pushing at her husband while driving could have just as easily caused the near accident.Anyway, I think the whole story is quite believable even though there are some very convenient coincidences. Just watch Reality TV and you will see even more unbelievable stories.",The Next Three Days

The horse is haunting her? Some demon looking thing that looks like a moth is haunting her? She went crazy? See, these were all good plotlines, I dont see why the director couldnt choose one to go with.Second, there was a very decent couple of scenes in this movie. (The vicious make-out and the grisly end of the cheating piece of crap.)third, the ending was very confusing. The sister goes back into the house and sees what's in the closet, reaching out for it much like Molly. Does that hint at a ""Lovely Hannah"".

Cronenberg, but, it starts to make sense about a third of the way through. Often called a ""drive-in"" film, and not really seen in the US, this is a true genre experiment by the relatively green director but it's too self-assured, and, self-aware to be just the middle part of a triple feature. The beats too familiar, the sleeze too obvious. That having been said, this is a truly entertaining movie about the small-time dragster circuit in the late 70's and, while the structure is a little repetitive(dialog, race, dialog, race), the conflict wraps up nicely and all the cars are filmed with a loving lens that makes them the true stars of the film.",N/A

550886,"when it comes to rock (maybe even music in general), the quintessence of overrated is one Elvis Presley. the man's claim to the title ""King Of Rock & Roll"" is dubious at best for two reasons...the first is that he was reasonably talented but HARDLY a genius. he only tried to write songs, to CREATE rather than simply RELAY music, once or twice. usually, he didn't even bother to participate in the selecting the next single release. and of course he was anything BUT an innovator. his act was modeled as exactly as possible on those of a thousand black artists who weren't about to get anything close to the same level of exposure, what with being black. indeed, Elvis' '50s heyday was marked by a uniquely shameless musical racism: numerous songs, including such anthems as ""Sh-Boom"" and ""Shake Rattle & Roll,"" were marginal semi-hits for the black artists who created them, then major nationwide smashes for the white artists who liberally appropriated them. and that's what Elvis' career was built on, really: the experiment had reached the point where a commodity could be made not of merely a song, but of a singer.(i grant you none of this was common knowledge at the time, but what about today, decades after the cat escaped the bag? you'd think that if there's one thing that should spell certain doom for Elvis worship - not necessarily Elvis fondness or appreciation, but certainly Elvis WORSHIP - it's the effective death of the misapprehention that he was an original. so why didn't it? God alone knows, and He's not talkin'.)the other strike against him is a simple question of timing. Muddy Waters sangs that the blues got pregenant, and they called the baby Rock & Roll. well, the '50s was the gestation period, and certain elements would need more time to crystalize. this scrappy little lovechild of blues and country will find it's own identity and establish it's own purpose - come of age, if you will - in the '60s. to declare King Of Rock & Roll someone who preceeds The Beatles and The Stones is like declaring King Of Literature some Neanderthal scribbling on his cave wall. or King Of Medicine whoever came up with releasing ""demons"" by drilling holes in the skull.but for all that, music was indeed Elvis' niche. (i repeat, i take exception not to his existing or having a career, but his being misrepresented as a pinnacle. you have to do more than simply sing whatever random song you get handed to qualify there.) his music may be unexceptional, but it wasn't terrible, and he was talented enough to get some fun out of it.the notorious train wreck that is his movie career is another matter entirely. your serious movie critics tend to have about as much affection for Elvis as they have toward Charles Manson, and even the most fanatic Elvis zealots have been known to grudgingly admit that there's a reason for that. even Elvis himself is said to of had only so much tolerance for the sort of assembly-line fluff-pieces he tended to end up in.this is what makes JAILHOUSE ROCK a semi-landmark. (it may be no CITIZEN KANE, but since the Elvis machine never set the bar that high, that's a moot point.) Elvis was one of those ""actors"" who was best suited to basically playing himself, and this film enables him to do so without drowning him in the usual Vegas-style schmaltz. not that there aren't still a few loose ends. in the beginning, for instance, when he goes to court for murder, he could plead self-defense. the only reason he doesn't is because there's no further story if he does. but all in all this tale of an angry young man's attempts to break into the business suits Elvis and his meager acting chops, to say nothing of the fact that the title track is his single best song.the fact still stand, though, that Elvis was the King Of Rock & Roll like Charles Manson was the King Of Law & Order. incredibly, some have actually asked, in complete earnestness, what would've become of Rock & Roll without Elvis. given that Elvis was a cypher and a puppet, the answer is, precisely what did become of Rock & roll. it's a fact: in a world without an Elvis, Colonel Parker would've just found some other stooge.rock & roll without THE BEATLES, now THAT would've been a catastrophe of Vesuvius proportions!!",N/A

The challenge for any writer/director is to find those things that will creep people out but hasn't been done to death. ""The Baby's Room"" might not be totally original but it's done up pretty well and sends the creep dial up to 8.Here's the scoop. A couple, with a newborn, buys a beautiful but old house. They plan to restore it but almost immediately things start to feel wrong. An audio baby monitor reveals a presence in their son's room. An upgrade video monitor shows the intruder. Locks are replaced, alarm systems installed but the intruder is still present. Nerves are frayed, hubby's work begins to suffer. He starts to uncover an uncomfortable history in the house and plans to set things right. But of course things are never that easy.I be likin' this director Alex de la Iglesia. He handles his work well. I usually find jump scares to be cheap, but he has one here that is too cool not to like. He also throws some physics in in the form of quantum theory (Schroedinger's Cat) to explain the parallel worlds. This is shot and cut well so the watch is real smooth. And at a svelt 77 minutes, it won't tax your attention span. The ""Twilight Zone"" type ending might annoy a few, and, as the problem existed in the house long before these folks got there, there is nothing to really explain how hubby ended up in both worlds.

222245,"If you were around in the 1970s, you remember more than just the bad fashions and the disco music.  You also remember that American men - a lot of American men - still held on to the last vestiges of what it meant to be traditionally masculine.  That is to say you acted like a swaggering, boorish ass with more muscles than brains.  Of course, this persona might be tempered, ironically, with long, feminized hair, special attention to how your butt looked in jeans, and an addiction to drugs and alcohol.  Such were the times.  If you were a boy during this time, and you were lucky enough to have a father who acted like a man rather than an overgrown child, you observed the phenomenon with a mixture of pity and apprehension.  If not, you turned out a lot like the guys in ""North Dallas Forty.""  They're not bad guys, at least not in the sense of digging up corpses or something, but they demonstrate the flaws of an extended adolescence built on a foundation of intimidating people one way or the other with testosterone.  Nick Nolte, never more born to play a role, is one of these guys, sort of, a thinking-man's football player discovering that despite his best efforts he is getting old.  And age just isn't agreeing with him.  His body is addled with aches and pains; his mind is clouded with narcotics so that if anything in his frat-boy-envious world ever made sense, it no longer does to him anymore.  Even sex brings more pain than pleasure.  His struggle is not particularly original.  He is the lion long in the tooth, surrounded by other lions that haven't figured it out yet, if they ever will.  Certainly, the superior ""The Longest Yard"" covered similar ground but more effectively because it gave the players a cause to play the game.  In ""North Dallas Forty,"" playing the game is the cause.  Yet this story makes sense in a time of casual sex, drugs, and rock and roll and in a country where professional athletes are treated like they're gods.  There is something psychotically desperate in their flight from anything resembling civilization, from the parties where Playboy playmates are dragged off to be violated, often with grinning protests, to the bone-crushing efforts on the playing field in pointless competition.  By the mid-80s and early 90s, these guys had turned into steroid-juicing Schwarzenegger types, their hair trimmed neatly and their muscles oiled to homoerotic perfection (shhh, don't tell them), but here they are still rough around the edges, flawed like real people are.  ""North Dallas Forty"" succeeds in exactly what it wants to be - an indictment of the very image of man that it glorifies, but in this it is never satirical enough to be biting and never insightful enough to be dramatic.  It is fun though, the way watching a guy get hit in the crotch on ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" is fun.  Look for Mac Davis as a good old boy looking out for his friends' best interests so long as they approximate his own, but watch out for Dayle Haddon, who would be a deck chair if she were any more wooden.  G.D. Spradlin plays a prick as only he can.  Ted Kotcheff, never an imaginative director, gives a sallow realism in his straightforward approach, one of the highlights of a film that is at times a Mad Magazine version of professional sports.  The best scene in the film occurs in the locker room as the players nervously await the upcoming game.  You can almost smell the desperation and Ben Gay, and the bit where the minister blesses the whole event is a hoot.  And now that 80s are back fashion wise, we might even see this neanderthal return to celebrated glory.",N/A

I've just read a few negative reviews on this page and I guess it is best to assume that many people would still prefer yet another cop drama be aired instead.

He is now married to his former secretary, Megan.  She does a sexy singing number in French at a party she throws for Don that is the highlight of the show.  To show it in 2012 is the ultimate in camp whereas in 1966 it was simply hot. The men go wild.Roger Sterling remains a wonderful semi villain.  He has moments where he is almost likable.  Then he will do something absolutely rat like which makes you hate him anew.  In this episode the issue is his office which really should belong to Peter Campbell.  The solution is pure Roger.Peggy is moving right along as the only female ad person in the agency. It is quite clear that she is becoming the main ad person Don relies on for creative ideas.  She still does not have his incredible instinct for pulling a creative idea right out of thin air which wows the client.Betty, Don's ex, is not in this episode.

Anderson is at the helm - and the whole film just felt like it was chugging slowly along.It's a case of a lot of gloss and little substance, but a film is trouble when it struggles to even make the gloss work. If you are considering this, then rent or borrow it first before you commit to having it on your shelf, but you're not missing anything special if you give it a pass.",N/A
1462943,"This move was actually very surprising, I did not think it was going to be as enjoyable as it actually was.  After having seen the preview, I was skeptical at best...it seemed kinda cheesy.  How ever, I like sci-fi & all that, and I like Nick Frost, so I finally decided I would give it a watch and see what I thought.  By the end of it, I was actually fairly entertained.  It wasn't what I would call the absolute best movie I've ever seen, but it was definitely better than average I thought, and it by no means sucked.  It was a fun new sci-fi horror comedy that was rather unique.  Nick Frost didn't play the biggest role in it, but for the parts he was in it, he was pretty good...his usual goofy funny self.  The stuff he does with Simon Pegg (i.e. Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Paul, Adventures of Tin Tin, etc) will always be my favorite though, of either actor, though they have been good in everything else I've seen each of them in.  I was not real familiar with the other actors in this movie, but they all did a really good job I thought, even the 2 kids.  If you're into sci-fi, horror, and comedy and language & gore doesn't phase you, then I highly recommend checking out this one...it's actually quite entertaining.

Seems that a rare mineral on board could be used to power a sound beam that will knock any missile out of the air when entering us airspace, causing a race to raise the ship. The script and acting are pretty flat. Since this was made in 1980, you have to keep that in mind when watching. When they finally get to raising the ship, the effects are quite good and worth watching just for that. I would give this film 2 1/2 stars.

1300366,"Probably the only thing stopping this from being the best remake it could have possibly been is Jackie Earle Haley. Replacing Freddy Krueger takes away from the movie, and Jackie isn't the Freddy Krueger we've sat and watched kill a dozen teenagers per film. In the 2010 reimagining of Wes Craven's film A Nightmare on Elm Street, Jackie Earle Haley plays Freddy Krueger, and it is extremely different compared to the classic slasher film many viewers grew up watching. There is a different take on the make-up, as Kevin Yagher is not on the team for the remake. This movie is also dependent on computer technology, as it was used to ""remove"" parts of Freddy's cheek to make him look more like a ""real burn victim"" (although I, personally don't think either of the actors looked like real burn victims). The voice Jackie uses, although awesome and evil, doesn't belong in a remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street. His voice sounds great, and he's perfect for horror movies, but he really wasn't that great as Freddy Krueger.  I think Robert should have come back for a remake, or they should have stayed more faithful to the original movie, using the same character names (I think Nancy and Freddy are the only characters from the original movie that are in the remake).So, I say it's OKAY.

They say the MMA gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean, and when they pulled it out four perfect drops fell back into the sea, and those drops became the legendary events of Pride. I say, Pride was made by a handful of brave men. Warriors, willing to give their lives for what seems to have become a forgotten word: honor.Pride fighters were an intriguing people. From the moment they woke they devoted themselves to the perfection of the art of real fighting. I have never seen such discipline. I am surprised to learn that the word Ray Jackson means, ""to troll"", and that Mr. Jackson believes his rebellion to be in the service of mixed martial arts.There was once a battle at a place called Trollmopylae, where three hundred brave Pride nuthuggers held off a Zuffa army of a million shills.

He has to lead the crew and fight against aliens out to take over the world. The story has a couple of different aspects, but for the most part it was about the special effects and action sequences, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I liked watching the Destroyers and the Carriers sail. The special effects were really great to watch. I was really worried when the Battleship Missouri was brought into the battle. I didn't want that ship destroyed, even in a movie. I would have to reconsider my rating if something happened to that floating museum.Overall, it was great. The actors were believable, even Rihanna.

1451227,"Shakespere's late military drama ""Coriolanus"" is rarely staged. Perhaps the most famous modern production was at Stratford-upon-Avon: during the run Olivier injured himself in his spectacular death scene and had to be replaced the next performance by a young Albert Finney, leaping into stardom. To my knowledge the new movie version is the first time the tragedy has been filmed, and a very impressive d&eacute;but it is. Ralph Fiennes, who seems to have made a career playing aloof patronising men (Eugene Onegin, et al), is making his own directorial d&eacute;but, guiding himself in a strong performance as the fatally disdainful patrician. He has placed the 5th Century BCE story in our own 21st Century with almost depressing relevance: the military invasion, the political back-stabbings, the bloody assassination are all alarmingly suitable. Most of the violence is presented in the opening sequence, as the Romans storm Carioli and Caius Marcius single-handedly defeats the citadel, earning himself the honorific title Coriolanus. Both Carioli and Rome seem to be suffering inner-city blight as filmed by cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, but, considering the bleakness of this story, his neorealistic vision is apt. The acting  of Fiennes's supporting cast is also realistic, no one attempting a ""grand"" style, yet remaining faithful to Shakespeare's expression. Brian Cox is especially good as Menenius, and his scenes with the two conspirators played by James Nesbitt and Paul Jesson are some of the best in the picture. (By the way, during the crawl credits at the end, we learn that two of the Roman citizens have been christened Cassius and Tamora, dark characters from other tragedies.) Vanessa Redgrave is Volumnia and gives the part a great deal of stern dignity, never allowing her formidable character to become nasty. Volumnia is first and foremost a mother. (Interesting note: Miss Redgrave, who is the daughter of Sir Michael Redgrave, has yet to become Dame Vanessa. She is, of course, a political activist.) Gerard Butler, as Aufidius, is the only cast member who seems to be slightly out of sync, though his hunky presence makes him a believable warrior. The picture is only about two hours long, so needless to say a lot of Bard has been excised; but John Logan's screenplay retains enough of the plot and poetry to make this a worthy Shakespearean production.",Coriolanus

Having enjoyed Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner in ""The Woman In Red"" I figured ""Haunted Honeymoon"" to be a safe bet. How wrong I was..!!! The amazon staff reviewer comparing this movie to ""Radioland Murders"" is dead wrong as well. While ""Radioland Murders"" fevered pace and non-stop one-liners don't really allow any time for character development, it is still a damn funny movie. ""Haunted Honeymoon"" sags and drags and eventually collapses under it's own (very light) weight.This movie is simply NOT funny to be called a comedy. It is too brightly lit to be an ""old dark house"" movie and, at only 80 minutes in length, it seems to drag on forever in search of a joke that never happens.

1458875,"THE MILL & THE CROSS is about the 16th century Flemish painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder and one of his more celebrated paintings THE WAY TO CALVARY. If you're not interested in Art and especially the work of Renaissance painters, then you'll wnat to give this movie a wide berth. If you are interested then you'll be rewarded with one of the most stunningly beautiful films that I have ever seen.Director Lech Majewski has created a moving tapestry that literally begins with movement within the painting itself. We then see glimpses of peasant life which was the subject of so many Bruegel paintings. The recreation of the style, the colors, and the clothing worn is remarkable. Rutger Hauer stars as Bruegel along with Michael York as his wealthy patron and Charlotte Rampling as the painter's wife who also doubles as the Virgin Mary in the painting.Some of the images are incredibly brutal, for the people of the Netherlands at that time were often subject to harsh reprisals while the country was under Spanish domination. These images work their way into Bruegel's paintings along with whatever else he observed for he was the visual chronicler of his age, sort of a 16th century newsreel on canvas.The movie is highly stylized for in addition to copying the look of the paintings, there is very little dialogue. In fact there is no dialogue at all during the first half hour. As the film and the picture continue to progress, there is more interaction between the characters. By the time the end is reached (along with the finished painting), the film seems like a documentary. If you enjoy Art and are attuned to visual stimulation then THE MILL & THE CROSS will be almost impossible to forget.",The Mill and the Cross
157024,"KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE BLU-RAYThe Blu-ray release of Killer Klowns from Outer Space is drawing very mixed reviews with some thinking it was a solid transfer and others saying it was nothing more than an upconverted DVD. When it comes to Blu-ray and DVD transfers I don't claim to be an expert so you won't see a lot of the tech stuff. I have a lot of knowledge on film in general (horror and cult being my strong point), but again I don't claim to be an expert on Blu-ray and DVD technology so you'll just get my thoughts on how things looked.First off I wanna get into the package design, which personally I hated. Whenever FOX releases an MGM title they almost always change the cover art and the changes aren't for the better; at least with the Death Wish movies FOX released on BD they kept true to the original artwork (more so on 3 & 4), but all 3 retain a retro look in general. But the cover art for Killer Klowns looks like one of those really bad DTV movies. I suppose the original poster art and original DVD art might look too 80s so I get why FOX would make some changes, but this was horrible. Rant over; I just get annoyed when the original art is changed and even more so when it looks terrible.As for the video well look Killer Klowns is an excellent low budget movie that is a total blast, but truth is the movie isn't in high enough demand for FOX to roll out a 5-star treatment and full restoration of the original negative. Companies like Blue-Underground and Shout Factory, Synapse might be willing to go back to the original negatives for the most part, but those companies focus on cult cinema that's their specialty, whereas FOX has movies of more importance to them. However with that said something like that never excuses poor work done on a release.The Blu-ray transfer isn't gonna blow you away simple as that. But overall I found it a nice upgrade over the DVD, which was a little dark and murky looking and this BD release is brighter and more detailed than the old DVD. I'm actually surprised at the positive reviews for Anchor Bay's Halloween 4 & 5 and when people mention things they couldn't see on the DiviMax DVDs I'm like really? All this so called added detail I was able to see on the DVDs and quite honestly the differences between Blu-ray and DVD are minor and even more so when the DVDs are upconverted. We get the basic HD upgrade from SD, but if anything the Halloween 4 & 5 Blu-ray's are more upconverted than Killer Klowns from Outer Space.The transfer gets off to an ok start, but as the movie rolls on quality seems to improve. One thing I noticed from the very start though is the colors really pop. Besides the colors, detail as I mentioned is improved and I guess the best way to describe this BD release is if you've seen past MGM titles put out on BD by FOX you should know exactly what to expect from the transfer. Almost all of them are an upgrade over the DVDs with some being a major upgrade and some being a slight upgrade, but basically all the transfers look the same.Some complained about the grain level, but quite honestly I really didn't notice it much. For starters I expected a high level of grain like the FOX release of Death Wish 2 (not that a heavy grain layer is a bad thing) and also its been several years since I've seen this so I was focused more on the movie. Perhaps on another viewing I will take more notice of the grain, but in general I didn't find it nearly as grainy as some reviews have mentioned. In my opinion the grain level was just right.The one thing I will say though is while yes the movie does look good overall we shouldn't just accept anything since it allows companies to put in less work. If Blue-Underground, Shout Factory and Synapse can put together the release they do on a I'm sure much less budget than FOX there isn't any excuses for poor quality. But overall I was pleased with this release. As I stated some say it looks like an upconverted DVD and even actual blu-ray review sites a few have said that, but I would disagree. Again as much of a beloved cult movie this is Killer Klowns From Outer Space just simply isn't in high enough demand for FOX to put more effort into it, but what we do get I found pleasing and easily makes for an upgrade over the old DVD. The only thing the DVD has over it is a much better cover art.As for the audio like the transfer you won't be blown away, but audio is mostly solid and as I said before if you've seen other MGM titles FOX has put out on BD you should know what to expect from the transfer and the same can be said about the audio.The extras from the DVD have all been brought over and nothing new was added. Features are entertaining and I would like to go in more detail, but its been covered so many times not much I can add.Overall once again you won't be blown away by the audio or video, but it is a solid release overall and makes for an upgrade over the DVD. The transfer is nowhere near as poor as some make it and nowhere near as great as others. It's simply a passing transfer and it gets the job done.",N/A
409210,"This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power.The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty.The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them.Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes.She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite.She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him.The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children.There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro.The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to TexasThe last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches.The moral is given by some member of that rich band: ""You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich."" Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility.Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law.That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word ""future"" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Giant Special VHS

I'm young, so I don't have an extensive knowledge, but I have seen nearly every Jackie Chan and Jet Li film made (yes all the vhs dubbed glory that it entails). My list of names at the top is in no way complete, it's just that when I think of badass martial arts, that make me giddy and giggly when watching the mayhem, I think of these people. Iko Uwais has firmly planted himself on this list with The Raid: Redemption.The Raid is a flick that when you break it out for a group of guys that haven't seen it, it will get awesome. It's one of those movies that you have to be vocal during. The fighting is so brutal and darkly funny, that you can't help groaning and laughing. It starts off with lots of gun fighting, then segues into weapon fighting, before culminating with some brutal hand-to-hand. All of this is choreographed so naturalistically and just downright realistic.If you don't like blood and deaths in your martial arts films, then this probably isn't the best choice.",N/A

1363331,"Warning - Spoilers.This film was mean-spirited and depressing. There were no likable characters. This is not a dark comedy (as it's being marketed) - it's a very dark, depressing, and tedious drama.The portrayal of one of the lesbian characters was horribly bigoted and negative. Who wrote the script, Pat Robertson?Suicide is not art. The fact that one of the ""artists"" would incorporate an actual suicide (that she was largely responsible for) into her art was perverse. Who wants to watch a film with a scene like that?The cruelty that the characters inflicted on each other made watching this film extremely difficult. This is not entertainment. I felt just awful after finally finishing this stupid and very anti-human film.The pretentiousness of the art world was portrayed in a very fake and over-the-top manner - especially by Gillian Anderson's terrible character and that of Christopher Lee's. We get it, serious art collectors and artists are supposed to be ridiculous, eccentric, and snobby. Enough already. There was no need to make them into unbelievable caricatures of people who care more about pieces of art than their very own lives.Horrible film.

1445914,"""Switched at Birth"" is a unique teen drama series that manages to capture the life of the American teenager but also inclusion of storylines that center around those who are deaf.The opening premiere gave the ABC Family network its highest-rated premiere with 22-episodes being planned for release in 2012, ABC Family is now releasing the first ten episodes on DVD via ""Switched at Birth: Volume One"".""Switched at Birth"" is a series that focuses on two families, one family is the wealthy Kennish family featuring former Kansas City Royals baseball player John Kennish (played by D.W. Moffett, ""Thirteen"", ""Traffic"", ""Falling Down""), his wife Kathryn Kennish (played by Leah Tompson, ""Back to the Future"" films, ""Caroline in the City""), their daughter Bay Kennish (played by Vanessa Marano, ""The Clique"", ""The Brooke Ellison Story"") and son Toby Kennish (played by Lucas Grabeel, ""High School Musical"" films, ""Milk"").The other family is the Vasquez family which consists of single mother Regina Vasquez (played by Constance Marie, ""George Lopez"", ""Selena"") and her daughter Daphne (played by Katie Leclerc, ""Veronica Mars"", ""Flying By"") and Selena's mother Adriana (played by Ivonne Coll, ""Lean on Me"", ""The Godfather: Part II"").The series begins with Bay Kennish wanting to know why she looks so different from her parents. It has always bothered her but when she asks her parents for a favor to do DNA testing, her parents do just that and they find out that Bay is not their true blood daughter and that the hospital made a mistake and their baby was switched at birth with the Vasquez family.So, immediately both families meet and despite Bay initiating the tests, she is not too thrilled that she is not the real blood daughter and to see Daphne, a redhead young woman being raised by a Puerto Rican mother.  She is also deaf.Immediately, after discovering who their true blood daughter is and that their children were switched at birth, knowing that the Vasquez are not in the best financial state, offers to let the Vasquez family to live in the guest room.  Also, it can help the Kennish family get to learn more about their daughter.But immediately, the Kennish family wants Daphne to go to the best school, consider having surgery to give her a chance to hear and a lot of parenting things that go against how Regina has raised her daughter and sure enough, this leads to various rifts between both Regina and Kathryn on how Daphne is to be raised.Meanwhile, Daphne  starts to learn that she gets her fiery temper but also her interest in art through her real blood mother Regina.  And as quick as she found her real mother, Bay now wants to find who her real father is.But because Bay tends to do things without thinking about if first, she and Daphne tend to clash. Especially when it comes to guys as Daphne starts to take a liking to Bay's ex-boyfriend Liam and Bay takes an interest in Daphne's childhood friend Ty.Meanwhile, as the Kennish family are pursuing a lawsuit against the hospital and wanting nothing more but a public apology, they receive distressing news that their lawsuit may not go far, because of something that Regina has done in the past.""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" DVD comes with a total of 10 episodes on two DVD's. Here is a spoiler-less summary of each episode:DISC 1:EPISODE 1 - This is Not a Pipe - Lives change for the Kennish and Vasquez family when they find out that their daughters are not their true daughters but were accidentally switched at birth.EPISODE 2 - American Gothic - While getting used to the Vasquez living with them, for the Kennish family, they are not too sure how they feel about Daphne riding on a motorcycle with Emmett.EPISODE 3 - Portrait of My Father - Bay starts to ask Regina's questions about her biological father, meanwhile John starts to watch Daphne's basketball playing.EPISODE 4 - Dance Amongst Daggers - Bay finds out that Daphne is dating her ex-boyfriend Liam and Daphne finds out that Bay is dating her good friend Ty.EPISODE 5 - Dogs Playing Poker - Toby tries to use Daphne and Emmett face reading skills in winning at gambling.DISC 2:EPISODE 6 - The Persistence of Memory - Kathryn gets Daphne to try out a cooking class at Buckner Hall.EPISODE 7 - The Stag Hunt - Bay and Emmett, along with Daphne go to find out who her father is.  Meanwhile, John and Kathryn's lawsuit against the hospital starts to go awry when it is revealed they have something on Regina.EPISODE 8 - Pandora's Box - Daphne opens Regina's guitar case to find pictures of Bay whens she was younger.  And Regina's secret is revealed.EPISODE 9 - Paradise Lost - After being kicked out of the Kennish home, Regina is trying to make amends with her daughters and with the Kennish family.EPISODE 10 - The Homecoming - Bay's real father Angelo (played by Gilles Marini) comes out of nowhere to visit his daughters.  But does he have other ulterior motives?VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) and for the most part, the picture quality is satisfactory for this drama series. Also, it helps that the series features various settings, including many outdoor shots which definitely makes the PQ for the DVD much better.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven, dialogue is clear and understandable and music comes out quite clear from the front channels. The series is not the type of series that utilizes special effects or the use of the surround channels but if you have a modern home theater receiver and a 5.1 or 7.2 setup, definitely worth selecting audio on all channels on the receiver for a more immersive soundscape.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" surprisingly comes with no special features at all.EXTRAS:""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" comes with a slip cover case plus ""Switched at Birth"" iPod stickers.JUDGMENT CALL:I am definitely enjoying ABC Family's ""Switched at Birth"".  I love the characters but I also love the complexity of how things are between family and friends.For example, to compare with another ABC Family show ""The Secret Life of an American Teenager"", I dislike how everyone from different circles manages to be stuck within their circle (including main characters dating each other within that circle) and everyone gets a long so perfectly.  As much as I have enjoyed the show, those situations tend to be a major pet peeve of mine when it comes to that series.With ""Switched at Birth"", the writers are not afraid to bring in newer characters, even for love interests but then not afraid to move on without certain characters.  Also, nothing is hunky dory with these characters.  There is always drama and just when you think these families are going to click with each other, something will drive them apart.If anything, life is not perfect and writers are not quick to submit to happy endings for these characters.Also, it's interesting how they take on the characters that are deaf.  The series looks convincingly real and I thought that actress Katie Leclerk (who plays Daphne) was actually deaf, until she had a dream she was a normal girl and was talking perfectly.  So, for her to play a deaf girl and having that similar speech pattern, I was quite impressed.  She does a fantastic job playing the role.  As well as actor Sean Berdy who play the role of Emmett.  He may be able to hear, but he can't talk and if anything, his face really tells you what kind of emotion he is feeling.But so far, casting has been spot-on with this series.  Both young and older talents of the series do a wonderful and believable job so far in these ten episodes.While, there are some major developments that take place towards the final three episodes, it'll be interesting to see how the series will go, once the series comes back to television in Jan. 2012.  Things have not always been the best between the Kennish and Vasquez families, especially between Bay and Daphne....but obviously, how things ended in episode 10, you have a feeling that something bad is going to happen between these two characters?But with ten-episodes, I watched each of these episodes in a quick marathon and was pretty captivated to the storyline from beginning to end.  I just wished there was more added to the DVD.  May it be interviews or even special features or gag reel, that would have been great to see.Overall, ""Switched at Birth""  is an enjoyable drama series on ABC Family and I'm hooked!  If you are looking for a very good family drama on television, don't hesitate in giving ""Switched at Birth"" a try!Definitely recommended!",N/A

1495646,"I would agree with the four/five star reviews in that the film was a twisty, thought challenging love triangle suspense with a largely unexpected and well acted and scripted storyline. However, with the four star reviews as opposed to the five star reviews the main criticism was ""suspension of belief"" which for them was a plot that was a little too perfect and polished, especially with all the complicated counters thrown-in meant to lead the viewer off track. It was just a little too unlikely a perfect crime storm to be believable.

1529990,"As with the title here, some have called THE AGRESSION SCALE a version of HOME ALONE with the results of the traps seen on screen. That's an apt description. Does it make a good movie? When it comes to originality yes, but in follow through it heads to the mediocre level.Ray Wise plays a mobster just released from jail. Before he heads out of the country and can stand trial he gives his top man Dana Ashbrook an order: find the person who took $500,000 of his money and kill him and his entire family and do it in 48 hours. With few leads to follow Ashbrook and his team go down the list of names they've been given, each leading them closer to the suspect. Not wanting to leave witnesses, they also kill each person they come into contact with.So where is this suspect? He's just remarried a woman who brings along with her late teens daughter, a girl who wants nothing to do with this family or with her new step brother. That stepbrother has a bit of a problem and was recently released from a mental hospital. It seems that he has a tendency towards extreme violence, something measured by what they call the aggression scale. His scores far exceed anything seen before but medication seems to be helping.The bad guys follow their leads until they arrive at the just purchased home of the newly married couple. A combination of torture (not lengthy) and murder leave only the kids left to deal with. But as this team begins to search the house for them, the young boy turns the tables on them, leaving traps and wounding them as he helps his new sister escape.The team tracks the kids down not just through the house but in the surrounding woods as well. Along the way they have serious wounds inflicted upon them by the resourceful kid, some going so far as to be killed in self defense. He may just be a pre-teen but these goons have no idea who they're up against.The idea of having a troubled teen taking on tough guy gangsters sounds like an interesting one. The traps he makes for them are well thought out and vicious at times. When you add the touch of the aggression scale psychological make up to the mix it makes it even more interesting.What stops the movie from being great though is the acting. It's not terrible but it's not quite that good either. Worst of all is the step sister who's screaming while attempting to hide from the bad guys makes her one of the stupidest victims of all time. Hint: when you're being chased, never scream to give away your location.One interesting note among the cast is the coupling of Wise and Ashbrook. Both were part of the now famous series TWIN PEAKS. It's nice to see them reunited here.As I said, the movie isn't that bad and actually has some decent moments in it. You can tell that this one is a low budget flick but in the end it seems better than several big budget films I've seen in the past few years. It may not be for everyone's taste, but if you're looking for something a little different and don't have a problem with low budget style and acting, then give this one a watch.",N/A

October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are ""alternative"" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!As imaginative and stimulating as the first ""Hellboy"" movie was, ""The Golden Army"" manages to surpass it. It's crammed with critters and beasties that any fan of the supernatural, science fiction, special effects, or creature features is sure to enjoy, high lighted by a particularly enjoyable romp through the ""troll market"". Del Toro's unique vision is once again brought to life in this eye-popping spectacle, which looks absolutely stunning on Blu-ray. The plot is much more ""fantasy"" based than ""occult"", as it was in the first movie, but it's still fantastic, and it works perfectly with the imaginative universe that the  charismatic Hellboy and his friends inhabit. If you're home on Halloween night, a double feature of ""Hellboy"" and ""The Golden Army"" is a great way to spend the evening, as you munch upon Whoppers and Reese's, dispensing candy to the little ones as they come knocking at the door. Just be sure that you're giving your treats to children in costume, and not creatures that have escaped from the imaginative world of Hellboy... on second thought, you should probably give them candy, too.

It has an excellent performance by Gregory Peck as a captain forced to place duty before his own desires and Anthony Perkins as a young Aussie officer facing both his own death and the inability of his wife, well played by newcomer Donna Anderson, to accept their fate.As for the copy, it works well in both DVD and blu-ray players with a very sharp picture with a few scratches due to age-this is especially true when the sub crosses beneath the Golden Gate bridge.  The only problem that was a bit jarring was that the scene selector seems off and there was once an informative little booklet with the disc, but I guess that these booklets are a thing of the past--this is a shame because they do bring you some light on how the film was made, its crtical reception, and fun facts.  All-in-all, this is a film for the ages and deserves a re-issue.",N/A

1503553,"Higher Ground is quirky. It jumps around a bit and makes one wonder what was left on the cutting room floor. There are several stories behind the story that don't quite get told, such as when this Evangelical group went from church to ""house church"" and then back to church, again. But since I lived through those times and saw many events like this in my own life, I found it easy to connect the dots.Higher Ground was disturbing for me as someone who saw a fair amount of abuse in the Evangelical scene, and as someone who finally escaped it. I know several people who are suffering emotional and spiritual scars from their times in that scene, and this film helped bring some of that stuff to the surface.Higher Ground is thought-provoking, just because of what I said above. I spent more time talking about this film afterwards than any other in recent times, probably just because I lived through similar things as the protagonist in this story. I came to the concusion that her ""Higher Ground"" was actually questioning what was going on around her.I wouldn't call this a ""must see,"" as some other reviewers here. I'm glad I saw it, as it gave me a chance to reflect (once again) on some stuff in my own personal history with the Evangelical scene. I will continue on my journey of faith, and I will continue to seek ""Higher Ground.""",Higher Ground

My initial obsession with the movie came because it's based in Alaska and I was born in Alaska.  This is more of feel good Christmas movie, going through the troubles of family (disobedient children, broken relationships) and in the end it ends with happiness.  If you like Alaska, Christmas, or movies with truck drivers, I'd recommend giving this a shot.  It's definitely an 80s movie, with ""Santa Claus: The Movie"" type acting and filming.

I feel towards ""John Carter of Mars"" like I feel towards ""Firefly"", or ""Starship Troopers"".. great entertainments that didn't catch on or were unfairly maligned, and I'm happy to see so many positive reviews here on Amazon.  I saw this film in the theater, and had a great time.  I laughed out loud alot at how audacious and fun the storytelling was.Simply put:  this is a classic swashbuckling adventure story. There's a tough hero, a beautiful princess, a host of adversaries, colorful side characters, steampunk technology, gorgeous Native American-meets-India-meets Final Fantasy art design, great soundtrack..there's also little to no swearing, no nudity, no bloody violence, no deep morality messages about racism or sustainability or how fathers don't love their sons enough, etc***and THANK YOU - no gritty realistic looking desaturated color palette.Yeah, this film is colorFULL- it looks fantastic in High Def!and it has plenty of romantic subtext, action and humor. And critics moaned about how the story didn't make enough sense. I could care less that they combined and altered some of the original books ideas and elements.. it was written 100 years ago.  It's no big loss, you can read it for free!Big plus:  a family-friendly entertainment that might get your kid interested in reading a hundred year old book  ;)If you're like me and like ""serious"" fantasy films like the Lord of the Rings, but ALSO have room on your shelf for lovingly made, FUN fantasy films that don't take themselves too seriously and are perfect for all ages, please give this film a chance.",N/A
1451686,"If you want to change a party lead it, if you want to change a country lead it!,What a performance from Meryl Streep! One of her best movies if not THE BEST! She is quite unbelievable. Forget Deer Hunter, and the Devil wears Prada. She is probably the only actrice alive today that can put together such a performance.I understand that some people didn't like the back and forth between now as a sick individual and the past as a powerful LEADER. I also understand that some people thought that this movie is an insult to a great leader. However, while at the beginning I was frustrated too, by the end of the movie you get the message. This movie unlike many people try to make you think is homage to Margaret Thatcher's life, character and will. She is winning against the disease too.Never compromise. This is absolutely true for Maggie. She is fighting a terrible incurable disease now the same way she fought the other diseases that were taking over her country at the time she was Prime Minister. She is not confused at all as many people try to make you believe. The very end of the movie shows you what Maggie is all about. She is packing all of her husband's stuff, and she tells him: if I don't hear you don't exist; you are dead.The movie shows briefly her confrontations with the unions as a secretary of Education. The things that she said then can be applied to today's society easily.This movie is very actual, and there are so many similarities with the current political situation in the world that it will be very difficult for me to summarize them. You must watch the movie! And learn. Try to find leaders and try to convince them to run for office and let them try to change the world for the better. Do not let the politicians run for office. Find the leaders!When Maggie first decided to run, she was convinced she is not going to win, but she wanted to make a point. Airey Neave then told her the famous quote that is in the title of my review. When there were riots in the streets, the politicians came and told her to slow down. When Maggie asked them why, they replied because we are going to lose the next elections. And Maggie goes: ""aha, we worry about job security!"" Look around you. How many politicians you know that will really run for their ideas regardless of their popularity. That is a leader. There were only three leaders in the second half of the last century: Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. This movie depicts the life of one of them who like Churchill after saving Great Britain from misery, was immediately dismissed by the people who like and prefer instant gratification. (Churchill was good enough to lead Britain to victory during World War II, but was not good enough to lead Great Britain in time of peace according to the British voters at that time. Go figure!)There is a great scene in the movie when Maggie as a patient goes to the doctor and the doctor says: How do you feel Maggie? And then she starts with a great monologue about society that worries more about feelings than people's thoughts. Could that be applied to today's society? Absolutely!Great movie, five stars all around because of the acting, the script, and the director. It shows what a person with real character is. Keep the movie handy and watch it many times. Each time you will find a point of interest that you missed in the previous viewing. Need to find somebody like her and Reagan these days to help deal with the very difficult times.",N/A

1486831,"Iran has come to be seen in the West as a perpetual rogue state and political pariah because of its commitment to promoting hard-line Islamic fundamentalism and creating a nuclear weapons program. The makers of this film want to offer their audience another more disturbing view of Iran that goes inside the country and looks at how the institution of the family fares when it is under attack. The picture it presents is one of very divided society along the lines of conflicting religious and social values that cross generations and speak to a country that may not be united behind its political leaders and their rigid ideology. The main characters in this film are Nader and Simin, typical modern Iranian parents who unfortunately have fallen out over how to raise their daughter, Termeh. While the father wants to keep her in Iran so she can be educated according to the Quran, the mother favours taking her abroad for a western education. These two irreconcilable views invariably lead to the break-up of their marriage and a chain of nasty events that even the mighty autocratic regime of Iran, with the help of the Quran, is unable to resolve. While the family institution represents some of the strongest links in any society, when they begin to break apart, like in this story, its individuals become very vulnerable to outside attacks. Children suffer from the lack of parental nurturing; elderly parents don't get the help they need; outsiders step in and exploit people's emotions; and individuals ultimately turn inward and become self-centered. While Islamic law attempts to resolve these troubling situations by imposing rules, it cannot overcome the fact that Iran is a society made up of individuals who have not yet learned to put the interests of others before their own. Come to think of it, this is a human failing that dogs most of the human family with one exception: the Iranian regime papers over it with a facade of morality that is supposed to hold the family together even if it is clearly dysfunctional. People just don't understand each other in this film, right down to the very children who are the real losers.",N/A

376677,"One of Brian DePalma's best films, BLOW OUT, has arrived on Blu-Ray and DVD in a superb Criterion package. Mostly praised by critics though a box-office failure, ""Blow Out"" was one of the director's more fully-formed early features in terms of character development.While DePalma's visual flourishes are still on full display throughout (use of split-screens, Steadicam, etc.), the movie isn't just a Hitchcock homage (nor a basic riff on Antonioni's similarly-titled ""Blow Up""), with the filmmaker's original script following a B-movie sound effects editor (John Travolta) who catches on tape an accident that claims the life of an aspiring presidential candidate. Travolta manages to save the life of a girl (Nancy Allen) who was in the car with him, but soon finds out the accident was an assassination attempt when he plays back his audio recording, audibly picking up a gun shot prior to the incident.DePalma's scenario is equal parts JFK and Chappaquiddick, and Travolta's attempts to uncover the truth leads to endless pain and no way out; even his relationship with Allen, playing a simple-minded, easily influenced young woman, never becomes overtly romantic as he crusades to get to the bottom of the conspiracy, but is stopped by forces beyond his control, including a devious killer (John Lithgow) committing crimes just to lead the police away from his main goal.There are contrivances in DePalma's screenplay to be certain - why Travolta's character would ever give the original film over to Allen without making a copy first, or why he lets Allen go down into the Philadelphia subway system alone, are gaping plot holes that enable DePalma to craft a number of exciting set-pieces (including a dynamite car chase through a Philly ""Liberty Day"" parade), yet ultimately detract from the film's dramatic power. There are also times when DePalma the writer gets sidetracked - the picture primarily serves as a commentary on politics, corruption and conspiracy in the post-Bicentennial era, yet goes off track to incorporate a spoof on modern slasher films, while the entire Lithgow subplot also doesn't feel entirely at home with the film's other aspects either.Still, there's much to admire in the film, from Travolta's excellent performance (it's still one of his best), to the crackerjack editing and cinematography, with Vilmos Zsigmond providing DePalma with a neverending supply of beautifully composed widescreen images. Pino Donaggio's score is also one of his best efforts for a DePalma picture, while the entire movie has an authentic, atmospheric backdrop having been shot entirely on location in a city where the director spent a good deal of his youth. It's energetic and always entertaining, even if the screenplay is uneven and at times unbelievable.Criterion's Blu-Ray package preserves Zsigmond's cinematography in a newly remastered AVC encoded 1080p transfer with 2.0 DTS MA stereo audio, reproducing the film's original 2-channel Dolby Stereo mix. Both are effective, while extras include an hour-long, informative interview of DePalma by filmmaker Noah Baumbach that was conducted last October; a half-hour conversation with Nancy Allen, who recalls working on the film, with DePalma (then her husband) and Travolta; a particularly interesting segment with Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown talking about his process and how it has evolved over the years; the original trailer; and DePalma's avant garde 1967 indie feature ""Murder a la Mod,"" presented in HD. Highly recommended!",Blow Out VHS

488739,"Produced in English by Harvey Weinstein's company, it's odd that this two year old film has never been released officially in the U.S. Fortunately for me; I found this at a used store for only two bucks. It's the Chinese release of the film but there were English subtitles. The price is worth it although the film is a fairly standard war drama/mystery set in the eponymous city in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. There's plenty of noir-ish spy type confusion and the scenery is well reproduced.The acting is good, even from Cusack, a guy I'm not sold on. Buying him as a fedora-sporting agent was a bit much, but he avoided his typical Cusack mannerisms. Gong Li plays the wife to mob boss Chow Yun Fat and Ken Watanabe is the Japanese officer in charge of suppressing the Chinese resistance movement. I've yet to see any of those three phone in a performance and they don't do so here, either. I find it interesting if even a bit courageous that Watanabe is willing to play a person with a certain level of moral hesitation given the grim history between China and Japan that still simmers today. He is not the cartoonish evil Japanese military officer and for that the film gets some props because there is a level of moral ambiguity the characters wrestle with, not unlike the characters in another Shanghai-based war movie, Ang Lee's Lust, Caution.Shanghai is a mid-level big production film that harkens back to the noir-ish war films of the 40s. With a cadre of very good Asian actors and some good Yank ones as well, coupled with a quick moving story and some nice cinematic eye candy, it's not a bad movie to spend some time with, especially if you can find it for two bucks.

494958,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (Alice in Wonderland). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.Review of this 1972 version...This is flat out one of the best ""straight-forward"" tellings of the Alice in Wonderland story. I've been viewing the Alice movies available on Amazon in chronological order, and the entry viewed before this one was a TV production of ""Through the Looking Glass..."" showcased as a musical (Alice Through the Looking Glass). Yecch. What a relief it was to replace the memories of that eyesore with this quality production.This is one of the few ""Alice"" movies named after the actual title of the book, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". The accurate titling is a harbinger of what's to come, as this production is steadfast in sticking to the actual dialog of the book. I kept pausing the movie and looking up the matching passage in the book, finding it quite accurate, the dialog often corresponding to the text of the book word-for-word.Having said that, even this film does not include every one of Alice's encounters. So far I've yet to see a production with the pigeon and the egg segment, and this film is no exception. Also, the writers couldn't help but to throw in the Tweedledee / Tweedledum passage from Carroll's sequel.But this movie works. Sixteen year old Fiona Fullerton steps up to play a great Alice. She can sing, she can dance, and she may well be the prettiest Alice to date. She can also act, emoting genuine reactions to her fantastical environment. The best part; she looked like she was actually having fun interacting with the creatures of Wonderland.The film has one of those rare openings that portrays ""our"" Alice as the actual Alice Liddell that inspired Lewis Carroll to write down the story he made up for the Liddell girls on a boat ride down the River Thames. The movie opens on that fateful boat ride.The special effects are also worth noting. They are not at all ""in your face"" like so many digital effects of today. When Alice grows and shrinks it simply looks like she is REALLY growing and shrinking. They also did a nice effect on the hall of doors that gives the impression the hallway stretches to infinitely.The movie is filled with famous actors. Unlike some films where the ""famous actors"" sort of showboat their way around the set, these fine artisans disappeared so far into their respective characters as to be mostly unrecognizable. Worth noting is Peter Sellers making a return visit after playing the King of Hearts in the B&W; 1966 British version with Anne-Marie Mallik. This time Sellers is deep undercover of makeup as the March Hare. Next to him most of the time is Dudley Moore playing the Dormouse. They play off each other very nicely. Then there is Ralph Richardson playing the caterpillar. This is a part that requires just the right actor and Richardson doesn't disappoint (he would go on to play God in `The Time Bandits' a few years later and nail that role too). Perhaps a lesser known actor to some, Michael Hordern, plays the Mock Turtle. This particular sequence is a must view, as the Turtle, the Gryphon and Alice dance it up in an unforgettable way.The croquet sequence is good too. It's always interesting to see what kind of job they do dressing the King and Queen of Hearts. Here too a great job was done costuming all the players.So, at this point in history, 1972, I think we have one of the best contemporary, live action, straight tellings of the Alice in Wonderland book, which is highly viewable for adults and kids. This is one for the collection. (and yes, the movie is not in good shape. This is one Alice movie really worth restoring!)---------------All the Alice reviews in this series are on Listmania:1) Click on my user name (Everone's_a_critic)2) Click on 'Listmania!'3) The click on See 'Entire List'.",N/A

Part 1 was clearly made with a smaller budget and fewer special effects, but it feels much more personable and less contrived/artificial. The special effects in Part 2 detract rather than add to the quality.The entire casts were different between the two films, and the cast for part 1 was more authentic and natural. Taylor Schilling started the film a bit uncertain of her role as Dagny, but grew into the role by the end. The dialogue was elegantly austere, with less talk and more acting.After part 1, my wife and I left the theater excited and relieved that they had somehow managed to capture the true message of the book without sacrificing artistic beauty and flow.My vote: Go back to the original cast and director for Part III, and cut out the gratuitous special effects.",Atlas Shrugged: Part 1
1155589,"Quincy was in a way the predecessor to shows like CSI and Law and Order SUV. The show was one of the first to feature actually forensic equipment that was used in the real world, and many of the first season episodes felt authentic. The show was originally apart of NBC mysteries movies, but proved popular enough to branch out of its own. ""The Thigh Bone's Connected to the Knee Bone"" was typical of one of the early episode where believable forensic investigate was used to reconstruct the remains of a football player. That show won an Emmy. The first few seasons were actually pretty convincing for their time, and for the most part hold up today, without having to resort to the gore of shows like CSI and Law and Order SUV.However, as the show progressed the shows become preachier, and it was not uncommon for Quincy to get up on his soap box. Quincy in later seasons went beyond being a coroner and became a voice against pollution, corporate greed, and even Tourettes syndrome.There is nothing wrong with this but it is not really the job of a coroner. Never-the-less, even these episodes were entertaining. Some of these episode have become camp classics like the infamous punk rock episode, where you had the feeling the writers had little grasp of the subject matter.Still, I find Quincy far more entertaining than the dry CSI series, whose characters just don't really interest me. Even when Jack Klugman sometimes hams it up on the screen at least he is interesting to watch. He is an actor that brings genuine conviction to the screen.","Quincy, M.E. - Season 3"
219262,"As a piece of American circus history alone, this movie is worth the price.  Plus, they just don't make movies like this anymore - must have spent a fortune in costumes.  And, since I don't believe they had available special effects, the cost of wrecking a train must have been extensive.  Betty Hutton's acting, as always for her, was a bit over the top, but maybe not so much, since the character she played was highly immature and emotionally driven.  It's good family entertainment, with a plot believable enough for all but sophisticated adults, and the cameo shots of various celebrities, such as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, e.g., seated in the circus audience added a curious interest.  It's packed full of old stars, again making it worth the price, just to have some of them in one's collection.",N/A

1387124,"Independent Christian dramas have been the subject of some ridicule, primarily because they're often low budget affairs that wear their messages on their sleeves and feature sometimes questionable acting. Courageous manages at least to exhibit competent filmmaking, even if, as with previous films of its kind, it caters a little too heavily to a very specific demographic to be openly enjoyable for all. Set against the backdrop of the drug trade in Georgia, Courageous follows four deputies -- all fathers -- who are urged by their sheriff to spend more time with their families. When tragedy befalls one of the deputies, all four of them make a formal pact to change their lives and honor God in all that they do. My primary complaint had nothing to do with the message of the film itself; rather, I found Courageous to be a bit melodramatic and heavy-handed, choosing to gloss over complex issues with broad platitudes. If you're a believer, you may find yourself nodding in approval at the film, but don't expect Courageous to do much more than spoonfeed you what you already know it's going to say.",Courageous

1437365,"Ashley is a troubled teen who is sent to live with her Aunt Diane after being released from treatment. Ashley adamantly pushes her aunt out of her life. When she discovers a neglected horse, Ashley seeks Diane's assistance in helping the horse (whom she names Winston) to recover. In doing so, Ashley sees that there is more to life than her own problems. She also sees for the first time that Winston isn't the only one who is broken.One of my favorite parts about this movie is the example Ashley's Aunt Diane sets for her. Diane is a strong Christian who, while not perfect, seeks to live her life for Christ. Diane never preaches at Ashley, but instead shows her what it means to be a Christ follower through her own actions. Diane's patience, kindness, and compassion do not go unnoticed by Ashley. We also see at the beginning of the movie that Diane is praying for Ashley. It's a fair assumption that Diane continues to pray for her young niece throughout the entire movie and never gives up on Ashley, even though Ashley stumbles and, at times, yields to temptation.There are some great discussion points in this movie. Ashley struggles with drug abuse. While on probation, she is instructed to have no contact with her boyfriend. Yet, she makes the mistake of disobeying that order. It is a good example of why the choices we make are so important. They not only affect us, but also affect others. While there is some deep subject matter, I found this movie to be appropriate for those ages nine and up.Saving Winston is slow at times, but the end result is worth it. This movie has heart and shows how, no matter how broken we are, Jesus still loves us and yearns for us to find salvation and peace through Him.I have added Saving Winston to my mom-approved movie listing on my wordpress blog.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of 77 Ways Your Family Can Make a Difference: Ideas and Activities for Serving Others",Saving Winston

The attention to detail, like scratches on the bots painted surfaces after battles, and the different points of view, like looking at the destroyed Cybertron through Jack's helmet visor, make the story more realistic. I took an interest in Cybertron's history and how it effected Earth, and the relationships between the Autobots. The human characters, however, seem a bit dysfunctional, superfluous, unnatural and lacking in a united mission. Some tense moments and solid story line make this enjoyable to watch.Here's what our kids had to say: Quality computer graphics and sound effects, a smooth engaging plot line, interesting characters and mostly good voice-overs. ""Exciting."" ""Intense."" ""Starscream's crafty attitude and unique personality, as opposed to the other Transformers, is quite refreshing.""

The viewer feels and understands all of these by way of Caesar, the chimpanzee that is born to a mother whose DNA was changed chemically.  Caesar is on the upward path of evolution and yet the simian whose mind is brighter than man's (at least most men's for the purposes of this movie) is still seen and treated as the chimpanzee he appears to be.  And he is not treated kindly.  So he takes matters into his own hands and quietly turns the tables on his captors while, a la Moses leading his people out of Egypt, leads his fellow apes into the great wilderness outside of San Francisco.  Meanwhile, the viral components that aided the evolution of he and his mother and some other testees is doing quite the opposite to the human population and we are seeing (not graphically, mind you) the very beginning of the near extinction of the human populace and the eventual rise of the immune and now humanly intelligent apes.

239841,"""Dumbo"" is one of the great old Disney animation classics about a woeful little circus elephant born with abnormally big ears, who initially becomes the butt of many cruel jokes and treatment by the other circus animals.  Great animation, simple story, minimum of dialogue to bring the plot forward, and some really well crafted sequences with songs like: ""Elephants On Parade"" (a very surreal seq. for a Disney film), and  ""When I See's An Elephant Fly"" (wonderful song and seq. where wisecracking crows become father figures for the fatherless little elephant, and push Dumbo to finally discover that his big ears are actually a prime asset, allowing him to fly like a bird).  These and other choice sequences make this little film (only 64 mins. long) a memorable cinema treasure for children and adults alike.Also containing some DVD extras, included is a historically interesting and nicely delivered separate audio track on the whole film, talking about the various artists who made it, as well as the actors (all uncredited) who supplied the dialogue voicing.

This film  has everything a good film needs, good plot, amazing actors, very compelling moments and above all, a very strong message of faith. Hellen keller was deaf, blind and mute but still, she manage to learn how to communicate and express herself. This is a movie everyone should see at least once.The very first version I've seen of this film was the 1979 remake with Anne Bancroft again, it was about 20 years ago  back in elementary school. I remember being stunned by the power of this film. I think this is why I decided to watched the original version, to see what I think about it now , 20 years later.......The performances by Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke are outstanding! I think one of the comments on the DVD case says something about the film having  some of the most intense action scenes ever caught on film....I think they were right! Some of the scenes in there must've been extremely demanding for Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. The film also has very funny moments that will make you laugh when you least expect it.I usually like to talk about the cinematography when I review a movie but I guess I'll pass for this one, this was made in 1962 so besides the fact that it's a black and white movie, there's not much to say. I personally found it OK, good quality picture in general, there was also an appropriate use of lights. keep in mind this is 1962 ....so don't be too picky on picture quality....I would definitely recommend it to any Drama fans. The movie was very entertaining! Loaded with beautiful moments. A real cinema classic that will probably never die....ENJOY!!!!",N/A

This is the rare type of movie that is exactly what I expected. I thought it was gonna be boring with good fighting...and that's exactly what it is. The beginning and end are great but the story aspect is drawn out. I think that the main reason it felt that way is because this story has been re-done so many times that it begins to lose impact with every version.

249425,"Betty Grable is not known,nor does she have a reputation of making, good films and there are probably a few reasons for this. She was a pin up figure,known for her figure and looks,and perhaps her acting style. However in my youth more than marilyn monroe i saw her films,and i enjoyed them. There's a wholesomenessand she's never overtly seductive,as a matter of fact she purposely holds herself back and even her dress in this film is semi business professional,andits always an image she liked to put forward. It was only after the pin up sensation,and this whole matter is something she did not want to enter orpublicize on her own,but she is best viewed as a great entertainer,and 20th century fox had both her and marilyn monroe,so these must be stars they likedto groom with that image. Victor Mature,who was famous for on occasion playing these little Italy characters,even when he's tough he has a niceness to him,and the film starts with him. The trailer of the film is interesting with the line,'nothing like that has ever entered my head its much deeper than that.',a thought always hinted at in this film. The mature character is frankie botticelli,like a character in Hitchcock's Wrong Man,wrongfully slandered andaccused and treated thug like.Really electric chair. He likes to put girls onmagazines,play them up for the fantasies of people,model like,but not the girls he likes from his old neighbourhood and their families whom he loves. His character is the only character with any ethics and profound mental altruism in this film and a facet of these characters who are a part of these locales. Of course his love is the Grable type character who loves him,and their nemesis is the police investigator. For some reason there are a few leads for different characters,and they 'fix' on him. A fix is a code word for entrapment,which many people think has ruined modern police forces as more resources are pumped here,ruining neighbourhoods,and not putting money into investigations. This character is railroaded relentlessly but at the end a happly gloss is put on matters,and he carts off with the Grable character and they are married. After he's innocent that's why filmmakers can do this at hollywood at this time...the police investigator is a man who has visions before suspect is guilty of anything of seeing him in electric chair,murdered,and this type of fantassy isquite dangerous in investigators for we never know role they play in these communities,if they have these destructive impulses. Also near end of film officer is seen with all types of sexual fantasies,and the garable character opens the door midway for him suspicious of his leering ways. Investigators must have very clear minds but with multiple fixations,fantasies and impulseswe dont know what kind of investigative work will come here,early film noirof community life in america and the people who rose up in police forces,of course any entrapment process which carrles on for long term becomes entrapment in which the police or whomever,get all kinds of social services and localgovernment,complicit,making a mess of cities. Many other films will carry this theme..which is why many in the fbi and senior police forces and criminologists wonder at the logic of this. Especially if it becomes chronic,and the individuals they go after.They say it causes more harm then good,and there's a reason they have this view. What they do say is very often these investigators,not always there are many reasons,and in this film the word fixated is used,develop fantasies toward female characters which drive them. Senior police will tell you that's the crux of the problem,and all kinds of psychoanalytic interpretations can be made of characters...as entertainment it succeeds and is one of betty's best film,and her films always left me feeling good which is why she was always a permanent fixture in american films,trying to preserve her wholesome image,even as a chanteuse. Deleted film is interesting with gawking boss..elisha cook jr also appears and he just finished Maltese Falcon a movvie with similar themes..same theme would be replayed with Bogart's Knock on any Door(1949)about nick romano similar community member victim of society which i will talk of next.

I always thought George Lucas was brilliant by dumbing down the Star Wars universe to 3rd grade level. It sells. And don't get me wrong, I liked SWs. I read a lot of SF that would translate well to the screen but require adult attention and would not go well with the average BIG MOVIE VIEWER's need for instant gratification and short attention span. I read the first six Herbert authored Dune books from 1980-something on and I really gobbled up the Lynch theatrical film because it captured the mood, passion and evil of the Dune Universe. After Herbert's death I have read every prequel and sequel novel. As a result, I was forced to go back and reread several of the original books. I have concluded the DUNE story arc is far too strong to put on any video format because of the dense written dialogue and so much intense convoluted internal thought by the myriad of really interesting characters. Some of the later books would make great film but I am afraid much of the action required would be too gruesome and the scope to broad.

Intelligence abounds, from the direction, acting, script and the incredibly personal cinematography.I'd heard of the film from its many awards and finally checked it out. The very personal and insecure issues a young gay person faces are difficult to explain, often to one's self; Ms Oduye handles this complex dilemma with care, concern and precision. I was never in doubt of her sincerity.Her best friend, Laure (Pernell Walker) is excellent, as a tuff bull-dyke wannabe, with a heart of gold. The confused parents, ably performed by Kim Wayans and, especially, Charles Parnell, hit strong nerves. Indeed, the entire cast is flawless, and the crisp close-up photography belies its Indie status.My only argument is that it involves middle-class black folks. The story of a black Lesbian, a la ""Precious"", would be interesting. That might be a story that needs to be told.

Tinker Bell makes a startling discovery in this story - she has a sister named Periwinkle. Trouble is, Periwinkle is a winter/frost fairy and the siblings can never be together because they come from different worlds and will face difficulties in each other's world.I loved the creative twists in the plot as Tinker tries her best to find a way to spend time with her newly-found sister. Tinker gets plenty of help from her ever sympathetic friends such as Rosetta, Iridessa, Silver Mist, and even fast-flying fairy Vidia, who used to be so mean to Tinker in the past. The theme of sisterly love, the strong bonds of family and friendship, and self-sacrifice is beautifully woven into the plot, making this an engaging watch for both young and old alike. I usually watch the movies with my daughter and found myself particularly captivated by this story. The sneak peek on the DVD indicates there's another Tinker movie coming next year and we wait in anticipation. Meanwhile, this DVD is going to get plenty of repeat viewings by my little one!",N/A

395370,"Rockywas one of the biggest films of 1976.  Millions saw Sylvester Stallone play Rocky Balboa, a struggling Philadelphia boxer who ultimately got a bout with heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) and fought him to a split decision.Given how popular the film was, it was hardly surprising that a sequel would follow--""Rocky II"" was released in 1979.  In this film, Rocky marries Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire) and the two begin their life and family together in a working-class section of Philadelphia.Rocky initially has no interest in a rematch with Apollo, but economic setbacks lead him back into the ring.  Burgess Meredith plays Mickey Goldmill, Rocky's trainer.  Mickey trains Rocky very hard and makes key changes to his fighting style in the time leading up to the rematch.The cast members are again very good in their roles, and Brent Musburger even makes a cameo appearance.  ""Rocky II"" didn't garner as many plaudits or awards as the original did, but it is my favorite of the series--the climactic scene of the fight is one of my favorite movie scenes ever, and the film is inspiring and imparts the values of hard work and battling adversity.",N/A

There is a feeling of comraderie and a better flow to the episodes than in the later seasons. Perhaps the acting isn't as good, I don't know if I'm a goo judge of that, but I don't mind as long as it's enjoyable and relaxing. Perhaps in the later seasons they tried to make the social issues more prominent or realistic. In any case, this DVD is just good, clean fun!","The Best of Charlie's Angels, Season 1"
423406,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY REISSUE ***""Jeremiah Johnson"" is one of those movies that you wished you'd seen on the big screen. Well - with this sparkling new 2012 BLU RAY reissue boasting such a beautiful print - and if you've access to a half-decent home cinema kit - you sorta can mister (sorry couldn't resist).And there's more good news for us on the other side of the pond. Luckily this American Warner Brothers BLU RAY is 'All Regions' (A, B and C) so it will also play on all machines. And while it doesn't categorically state that the print has been fully restored (and despite a decidedly blurry opening shot of river boats) - a huge amount of cleaning up has taken place here because the print is BEAUTIFUL almost 95% of the time - and in some instances would put films of today to shame. There's even a hugely entertaining 'commentary' by the trio who made it - Director Sydney Pollack, Co-Writer John Milius and Actor Robert Redford.The other extra - an 11-minute Making Of called ""The Saga Of Jeremiah Johnson"" gives you a good indication of how bad the print was - it's 1972 picture quality is awful - covered in scratches and grain. The print itself is nothing like this. There are sequences by his cabin door in the sunshine which are so clear - even a night shot with Will Geer who plays the wily old mountain man Bear Claw around a campfire towards the end of the film is beautfully rendered. It's defaulted to 2.4:1 Aspect - so it has bars top and bottom. But it also has a 16:9 aspect fitting too - so even when stretched to full screen - it looks great and properly cinematic.The reissue's also faithful to the movie as seen - so it includes a 2-minute OVERTURE at the beginning with a still of Johnson standing on a mountain overlooking a valley - and at about 80 minutes in - it even gives us an INTERMISSION which in turn leads to a ENTR' ACTE restart. And no matter what the weather or season depicted - Winter, Spring, Summer or Autumn - it's shot with fantastic PanaVision bravado and style. The only real clunkers are the ever-so-slightly cheesy narrative at the beginning (words from it title this review) and the dreadfully dated 'aching cowboy' song that crops up at certain intervals when you least want it.Released in late 1972 - the film is a mid-1800's frontier tale - an amalgamation of a novel called ""Mountain Man"" by Vardis Fisher and a short story called ""Crow Killer"" by William Thorp. The ex-soldier Jeremiah Johnson seeks the solitude and freedom of the wilderness - which he gets - going months sometimes without ever seeing another human being. But he also finds freezing cold, starvation, friendly and hostile Indians (Flathead and Crow), pilgrim families and death by any number of savage means.Along the way he acquires a squaw-wife called ""The Swan"" (a beautiful part for Delle Bolton), a boy left mute by the killing of his family (Josh Albee) and a bald-headed loony he finds buried up to his neck in the sand called Del Gue (a scene-stealing turn by mad-eyed Stefan Gierasch). Throw in the near hysterical laughter of too-long-in-the-snow mountain-man Bear Claw (Will Geer) who is obsessed with hunting 'Griz' (Grizzly Bears) - and you get the general idea. Mostly Jeremiah muddles through - even threatening to become a 'family' man himself at one point. But then Johnson makes a gargantuan mistake in the second half of the movie by crossing sacred burial grounds and pays for it with a constant stream of singular Crow warriors Hell bent on killing him.Redford is magnificent in the central role - living it - breathing it - and looking more handsome than any mere mortal has a right to be. You can feel his star-quality screaming off the screen. You can also feel him relishing the outdoor settings, the simplicity of the life and the ecological thread running throughout the story. Filmed entirely on location in Utah - it has breathtaking scenery - and an almost savage reality to all of the characters - even those as vulnerable as women and children. It runs to just under two hours, but feels like three - and in a good way. And it all comes to a very satisfying and (in some ways) an unexpectedly uplifting ending...A fantastic BLU RAY reissue then - and what a thrill to see this criminally forgotten gem of a movie now sport such a gorgeous makeover.Recommended like a tumble in a river with a slippery salmon.And roll on Redford's own ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" in such superb print quality.BLU RAY Specifications:VIDEO: in 2.4:1 aspect and 16.9 alsoAUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio English 5.1, Dolby Digital French 1.0 and Spanish (both Castilian 1.0 and Latin 2.0).SUBTITLES: English SDH (Deaf and Hard-Of-Hearing), French and SpanishEXTRAS:1.

1024590,"Will Ferrell is popular as a comedian, but I've yet to find him in a movie that's particularly funny. This one was well-received, so I thought I'd check it out, especially since it has Sasha Baron Cohen in it, as well as John C Reilly, an actor I like very much. I'd say that of the three, John C Reilly is the funniest, with his good ole boy routine and his optimism that he can steal his best friend's hot wife and still remain buddies. Ha ha ha... Still, there are some good lines in the film like ""[The French} invented democracy, existentialism and the beejay."" Cohen, while not particularly funny here, does an interesting job portraying a ""happy"" Nascar driver. The gawks on commentators' faces when he introduces his husband are priceless. Sponsor's wife is lovin' the wall vibrations, that's pretty funny. Kenny Rogers scene is kind of funny. Nice use of a Monster Magnet song, ""Space Lord"", as well as AC/DC's ""TNT"", and Pat Benatar's ""We Belong"". Biggest car wreck ever. There's also a sort-of-funny ""I want to picture Jesus as a..."" running gag as well.The gag reel shows a great collection of Ricky and Cal's public service messages: kids on leashes, plastic - the silent killer, cardboard is edible, children reading too early, shopping cart safety, fare safety (kids wrapped in newspaper, sleep in a hammock, don't drink gasoline), shoplifting's fun, don't steal fireworks, packs of stray dogs that control most of the major cities of North America. Interviews with the actors in character are cute and sorta funny. The trailer shows scenes that are not in the actual movie (Ricky as a 10-year-old, for example).There's also a great French version of ""Paint It Black"" played in the film. Good soundtrack, so-so film.",N/A

147029,"RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP examines the tensions that surface between an obsessed wartime submarine commander and his resentful first officer. In director Robert Wise's very capable hands, this is a knuckle-biter of a movie. It showcases two all-time acting icons forcefully jawing at each other onscreen. Now RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP doesn't quite attain the level of nerve-jangling frisson achieved inThe Caine Mutiny [Blu-ray] (1954) and inCrimson Tide [Blu-ray] (1995). But the performances here are rock solid and Wise's technical execution, impeccable.Somehow USN Commander P.J. Richardson (Clark Gable) has parlayed his year-long exile at a desk job billet into a command of the naval submarine, the USS Nerka. From jump the crew is nonplussed by its new captain's actions at sea. Cdr. Richardson cracks the whip, insists on repeatedly drilling for an unorthodox bow shot maneuver. And yet when a Japanese target is sighted, he opts to retreat. The Nerka is assigned to patrol the unlucky Area Seven of the Pacific Ocean, although a caveat in the mission statement states that the Nerka must avoid Area 7's dreaded Bungo Straits, graveyard to sunken American submarines. So guess where the captain is steering his ship?The clash of wills between Richardson and his executive officer, Lt. Jim Bledsoe (Burt Lancaster), starts right away, and even before they set sail. Bledsoe, who feels he had been skipped over for the Nerka command, visits Richardson at his home to bluntly ask for a transfer, a request instantly denied by Richardson. So both men, going in, know how things stand.It gradually dawns on Lt. Bledsoe that there's a method to his skipper's madness, and his consternation grows once he realizes that Richardson means to hunt down and take on the Akikaze, the Japanese destroyer what had sunk his sub the year prior. Richardson is so singleminded even Captain Ahab says he needs to relax. It's not helping that Tokyo Rose is broadcasting over the Nerka's airwaves, serenading the crew with hip music, yeah, but demoralizing them with disparaging remarks about America's poor war effort. RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP makes for instructive viewing for those keen on learning about submarine warfare as it was during a bygone era and what life was like onboard a ship that sinks on purpose. The battle scenes are excitingly staged. The movie audience easily follows the action. In the third act, you could see and feel the embattled, submerged men reek sweat and desperation as the USS Nerka is mercilessly bombarded. And even after all this time, it's still a taut, compelling scene when the Nerka is forced to run silent as it engages its Japanese counterpart.Burt Lancaster produced this film and was rumored to have gotten vexed with Gable a few times due to Gable's insistence that his work day was done once 5pm swung around, even though, occasionally, he was still in the middle of a scene with Lancaster. Chances are, some of that rancor evinced by Lancaster onscreen was unfeigned. Also, one of my favorite character actors (and a hell of an insult comic), Don Rickles, makes one of his very first screen appearances.",N/A
1482532,"First, I'd like to say that Van Damme portrayed an excellent villain.  I was surprised.  But he never fights.  Why the hell would I want to see Van Damme simply strutting around as a charismatic bad guy?  Fight!!!  Fight Lundgren.  Fight Jet Li.  Fight Terry Crews.  I watch this movie to see legendary match-ups with choreographed brilliance.  In this flop, the great Van Damme fights Stallone at the end for about 2 minutes.  What the hell is that?Lundgren got a chance to shine as a thespian as well, his expressions priceless, BUT . . . who wrote the dialogue to this movie?  The gods of action are forced to spew the stupidest, inane, worthless, pointless phrases!!!!!  It degrades our American action legends!The young sniper is a blatant plot tool.  And he fires a sniper rifle faster than a double-action revolver.  Impossible.  Who advised this film?The guys barely fight all of the goons sent their way.  Instead there is a ton of gunfire.  Spraying and praying.  Why the hell do I want to see these action stars shooting guns the whole damn time?Remember that epic battle between Lundgren and Li in Expendables?  Remember that match between Stone Cold and Stallone?  Nothing like that in this film.  Jet Li is the best in this film, but he is in the film for a couple minutes kicking major butt creatively.  Then he literally jumps out of the film.  Statham has a nice scene as a priest, murdering a few guys.  Terry Crews throws a few goons around creatively.  But there is one villain of note, who never fights any of the other Expendables one-on-one.  What good is that?  Don't you want to see Statham vs. Van Damme?  Don't you want to see Li vs. Van Damme?  They really dropped the ball.  Hey, try paying a few famous MMA guys to be Van Damme's henchman and pit them one on one vs the Expendables!This film has a few exciting violent scenes.  It has too little hand-to-hand combat.  It is a bullet-fest.  If I wanted that, I could watch a million mediocre films with nobody actors.This is a collection of the gods of action, and all we get is a silly shoot-out with impossible shots made.  If I wanted magic, I'd watch Harry Potter.And please do not mention the ridiculous and corny Chuck Norris scenes.  He shows up for NO REASON, rescues them with magic bullet sprays and missile launches out of thin air, has corny music, NEVER FIGHTS ANYONE, and has dialogue that sounds barely more useful than a blast of diarrhea.I am so disappointed with Expendables 2.  I love these stars.  Each one of them.  I respect their skills, and I KNOW they can kick major butt creatively with great spectacle.  Instead, I got a POORLY WRITTEN, plot-less, bore with child-like dialogue.  The actors are obviously trying to be entertaining.  They succeed in their expressions, body language, etc.  But the script gave them a tasty heap of dung to speak and a paper-thin unreasonable plot that nobody cares about.How can these guys come from excellent movies like the Transporter series, the Rambo series, Predator, the Die Hard series, and so on--and YET accept this poorly-written poop-fest with guns???????Imagine Bruce Willis trying to take on Van Damme or a drunken Lundgren?  How cool would that be to see?  Imagine Arnold and Stallone duking it out over some plot twist?  How awesome would that be?  Imagine Jet Li and Statham teaming up vs. a ton of guys.  How about Terry Crews brawling against Van Damme?  How about Chuck Norris fighting his way out of a paper bag, if he still can?We get none of that.  We get a glorified day at the gun range.  So, I swallow my love for these legends, and declare Expendables 2 barely mediocre entertainment.  And it hurts to say that.  The first one is way better than this one.  Van Damme was wasted.  All the talent was wasted.Expendables 3 now looks like a bad fart on the horizon.  I have little hope.",N/A

His client, a young and rather arrogant soldier, is not only accused of murder, he admits he shot the guy.  His argument is that there is an ""unwritten law"" that justifies the killing.  Gently, his lawyer points out that unwritten law is not relevant in a court of law: only the written kind.  Still, he is willing to take the case mostly because he feels sorry for the young soldier and his rather pretty wife.I've always had a real soft spot in my heart for James Stewart, and for many of the other members of the cast, and it did, after all, get the academy award for best picture of 1959. One bonus is a score by Duke Ellington, who also does a cameo role as a piano player. I'm also fond of stories about lawyers.

Mater stumbles into the middle of an international spy investigation while trying to help Lightning win a multicontinent racing series.  Of course, Mater gets into all sorts of trouble, makes a lot of mistakes, creates a lot of comedy, but ultimately saves the day.

The stunt riding we see in this action flick is probably not much different from their daily death-defying duties. In this one, a messenger must get across town in a short time, so we ride along as he zips through traffic, across parks, and through stores, all the while trying to elude some guy in a silver sedan who seems determined to intercept him.* Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Inception"") is the Energizer Bunny, hired at 5:30 PM to deliver a ""Premium Rush"" envelope to Chinatown by 7:00 PM; he was specifically requested by name. This film runs 91 minutes so we watch this in ""real"" time.* Dania Ramirez (""American Reunion"") is his undecided girlfriend whose roommate kicks her out. She too, is a bike messenger.* Wol&eacute; Parks (lots of TV) is the gleeful competitor, not only for our hero's acclaim in the bike messenger community, but also for the affections of that lovely girlfriend.* Jamie Chung (""Sucker Punch"") is an inscrutable Asian whose hard-earned money is at stake. She hired our hero.* Michael Shannon (""Take Shelter"") is a relentless NYPD cop with a gambling problem.* Christopher Place (stunts in films like ""The Lucky One,"" ""Safe,"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"") is the dauntless NYPD bike cop who gives our hero a run for his money. This guy is so dedicated we can't help but (sorta) root for him.There are very few interludes where we can take a breather: We see countless accidents where a cyclist goes head over heels through the air after being hit by taxis, car doors, garbage cans, bikes and other hazards of the trade. We come to fear that scary cop in the sedan as he pursues our hero. We very much appreciate the goose-bump moment near the end when the bike messengers rally their forces, and naturally everyone likes a happy ending.This PG-13 outing has very little profanity, no blowie uppie stuff, a couple of gunshots, some violence and oodles of vehicular (mostly bicycle) mayhem.

Very much like prime Robert Altman, his films seems to wallow in  oddball collections of wacky characters with sometimes overly familiar actors doing dazzlingly unconventional work bringing them to life.  This is story of a pre-adolescent nerd doing a wildly romantic thing, kidnapping a young girl and running off to escape a hostile world. It is totally absurd, and is played, very much from the viewpoint of his character's warped pubescent  viewpoint.  His actions cause a major upheaval in the 1960s scout camp environment. Everyone is in dead earnest to get things back to normalcy. Edward Norton is his immediate scoutmaster, Bruce Willis is a cop trying to communicate with him, and Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are his parents.

Terri Garr plays their weak mom fairly sympathetically, but it's hard not to dislike her character.  Peter Weller plays her villain boyfriend to slimy perfection, but he comes off like such a weak loser, it's not surprising Christoher Collet's character could kick his ass. I think the character would have been stronger and more malevolent had an actor like Tommy Lee Jones been given the part.

Once Snow White's mother dies, her father marries Ravenna (Charlize Theron), who turns out to be an evil sorceress.  She quickly kills the King and overthrows the kingdom.  Snow White is then locked in a tower for many years.I personally thought that Charlize Theron did a superb job as Ravenna.  Ravenna is quite an evil character that you the viewer will hate.  You will not have one scrap of pity for her.  She is SO evil you can't help but want her defeated.  Theron's only flaw may be that she lays it on a little thick sometimes, she brings the crazy a little too hard.Well, before the Queen can cut out Snow White's heart and gain immortality forever, she escapes.  Enter the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth aka ""Thor""), who is forced to track down Snow White and return her to the clutchs of the Queen.  Along the way the Huntsman changes his mind and decides to aid Snow White.  Although this was obviously a side project for Hemsworth, he really does give it his best, he is a good actor.  Women alone will watch this movie just to see him.I would like to add that I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart, especially after all the 'Twilight' movies.  But, in this movie I REALLY enjoyed her performance.  I also thought she looked and assumed the role quite well.  I will concede that she is apparently a talented actress.  I will in the future be on the watch for her non-'Twilight' movies.The movie also delivers the 8 Dwarves to assist Snow White.  Yes, I said 8, but don't worry they fix that mistake pretty quickly...In the end Snow White and her companions after being hunted and chased the entire movie, rally an army and march on the evil Queen's castle.  The Queen is finally defeated, but only after quite a few people die.  The kingdom and the land are restored to harmony, and the darkness of the evil sorceress is lifted.--Summing Up--This film at times feels like 'Lord of The Rings' and 'Chronicles of Narnia' combined.  Not that this is bad thing.  It is never sappy, Snow White is never singing to birds or deer or anything like that.  As I previously stated the CG effects are AMAZING, with all sorts of unique animals and creatures brought to life.  I will also dare say that there could be a sequel...time will tell.  The only CONS this movie has is that it doesn't go into detail about a few things.  Why does the evil Ravenna have so much power?  Who does Snow White love, William or the Huntsman?  Who was the giant deer with the large wooden antlers?  What were the Dwarves names again?  And so on.  In the end this is all minor stuff.Overall this is a really good movie that men and women alike will enjoy.  So husbands and boyfriends take your women to this one.  Good luck having them not fantasize afterword about Chris Hemsworth...",N/A

311327,"Simply a surreal film. Really a maddening film...if it weren't for Altamont, this would be nothing more than a low budget fan-based Stones cult classic, but the events of December 6th, 1969 make it an historical icon. Presented under the guise of following the Stones late in their Gimme Shelter tour of 1969, this disjointed account follows the band as they complete a show at Madison Square Garden in New York and begin negotiations for a `Woodstock' like free concert in the San Francisco area late in 1969. Interspersed with recording studio drug induced sound checks for, among other things, an early recording of `Wild Horses', the film meanders towards the inevitable outcome at Altamont and the absolutely phenomenal occurrences of that day and concert.Really following no rhyme nor reason, this movie moves at a somewhat languid pace with snippets of concert footage and backstage coverage of the band...this Criterion Collection has performed an amazing service by digitally remastering these recordings to sound absolutely rich and astounding. The New York shows and Altamont shows all have a drive and depth with the bass and lead/rhythm guitars brought out and integrated with Jagger's vocals that really stand out. My only complaint about this `tour' film is that after the tragedy at Altamont, the Stones play some of their best live concert music and this film, unbelievably, does not present it.The highlight of this movie, obviously, is the Altamont concert and these events cover almost the entire last half of the film. Showing the rushed attempts at staging this show and the behind the scenes negotiating in the rush up to it, we're then propelled out to the raceway where we're suddenly a part of the concert scene. A `Woodstock' like affect then takes place as we see hippie after hippie take his place in the crowd and the ever present drug-like aura pervades. Suddenly, motorcycle-like rumbles override the crowd noise and the Hell's Angels make a ceremonial like entrance and the inextricable shift to violence begins as does the concert. Among the classic footage is a confrontational trash talk exchange between Jefferson Airplane's Grace Slick and the Hell's Angels frontmen over the clubbing into unconsciousness of one of its band members. Also, the Grateful Dead arrive and then soon depart, without playing, as they learn of the unrelenting violence associated with this concert.The Stones, meanwhile, purposely wait for nightfall, angering, according to Angels frontman Sonny Barger, the crowd even further and take the stage under an immense and violent aura. This is where the film gets hypnotic as the band breaks into their set while the Angels continue beating the crowd into submission. Pause after violent pause in the music is offset by Mick's pensive outlook as the environment is clearly out of control. It is amazing to see the concert aesthetics of the sixties as the Angels walk about onstage and even talk with Jagger between vocal sets. A large dog even walks across the stage and the motorcyclists wrestle with a large naked drugged out woman before we see Meredith Hunter in his lime green suit rush the stage before he's beaten back. It's not until it's presented to the Mick and the viewer in the ever present backdrop of editing this film that we see in slow motion the real horror of Hunter's and the Angel's actions. Carrying a gun in an apparent drug induced haze while rushing the stage, Hunter is beaten back, stabbed and killed while Jagger tries to control the crowd. Helicoptored out amidst loud sobbing from his girlfriend and under a blood soaked gurney, the band continues, but the viewer only gets to see Mick reviewing the `awful' footage on a small film screen in a studio and then walking out. This is where the film ends.While important from an historical perspective, this film was very revealing as a `you are there' anchor. The close proximity to the band as the violence was occurring and the abundance of concert footage earlier that day gives the viewer a solid view of Altamont and the absurdity of that day. Weak in its point of coverage of the Stones on Tour, it more than makes up for it with the melancholy and surrealism associated with the death and violence that equates to the epithet Altamont.",N/A

The latter was a similar, but less in-your-face version of what was essentially the same plot, that of a deadly comet heading towards Earth.  Each had their good parts, but I would rate Deep Impact as the better of the two.  Space Cowboys is similar in that it deals with a deadly threat from space, but from a far more likely source: other people.

313019,"Having read the fine literary version of the same title, I was very curious to see what Hollywood would do with it.  Not that I was optimistic.  The story is a about the tragic end of a free people, the Cheyenne.  Defeated and on promises that they would receive land and provisions, they were relegated to a desert in Oklahoma, where they starved and were victims of disease, dwindling away in the most sordid conditions.  Having waited for over a year, the remaining 300 or so decided the whites didn't live up to their side of the contract and left to return to their homelands in the Yellow Stone.  They had no provisions, very few weapons, and only about 60 braves.  So started a 240-some day trek that ended in death, murder, and long criminal trials, though they won the right to a reservation in Montana.  In the book, there is this sense of the meaningless death of a complex culture.  It is an absolutely awful story of a people trying to flee genocide and spiritual death by administrative oversight.The film begins with a splendidly tragic tone, as acted by the young Ricardo Montalbam, who plays a charismatic chief disgusted by the treatment of his tribe.  This is an unusual step for a major hollywood film, but the traditions of the genre soon betray the many qualities of the production.  There are several interesting military confrontations, with one character growing under the eye of the stern captain.  This is where the story diverges from history in increasingly ridiculous ways.  Set against the Cheyenne is a humanistic captain, who must do his duty but who regrets it more and more, empathizing with the Indians while courting a lovely Quaker woman who elects to travel with them as a nurse (both apocryphal, if memory serves).  Widmark is at his best here.  Unfortunately, the tone deteriorates terribly with a cameo by Jimmy Stewart, who plays a comical Wyatt Earp as he leads a Dodge City saloon crowd on a hunt for the Indians, complete with a portable bar and prostitutes.  It is funny, with a hooker running without her dress when the Indians fire on them, but completely destroys the mood.  There is a notable episode when a group of braves lead people wishing to surrender in winter, only to be imprisonned and told that they must march back to Oklahoma, which they refuse to do on pain of starvation and cold.  Karl Malden plays a stupidly wooden soldier who seeks to force them to submit, while Widmark opposes him and goes to meet the Secretary of the Interior, Edward G. Robinson.  They escape at the cost of many lives.  (In reality, they were captured and broke out.)  By the end, the film is overwhelmed by melodrama.  Widmark's romance advances, while Sal Mineo confronts Montalban over a woman.  It had lost me by this point, so that I wasn't even disappointed by the happy ending they grafted on to such an awful story.Nonetheless, there are interesting aspects to the film, particularly in view of the fact that it was made (in 1964) just before the 60s anti-authoritarian impulse became so commonplace.  Viewers expected heroes and unambiguous outcomes and that is what they got rather than tragedy and gritty realism.  There is a truly outstanding cast that held my attention until it degenerated into a kind of semi-serious shlock.  The documentary in my version, narrated by Stewart, also piles it on with pre-Vietnam optimism and no acknowledgment that there are problems on Indian reservations or even recognizing that the Cheyenne autumn was essentially the end of an ancient culture.  I would give this 3.5 stars and recommend it for film buffs but not for anyone interested in learning the history or simply a good cowboy-indian film:  too schmaltzy for the former, too slow and sad for the latter.  This story required more, much more, not only including tragedy, but also irony, cynicism, and an unflinching, even existential, gaze; it isn't here.  Contrast this with Little Big Man, which instilled a lifelong fascination with indigenous peoples in me, and you will see my point.  LBM was made just 6 years later, a true product of the wider perspctive that the 60s enabled.",N/A

437400,"""It wasn't a question of doing everything differently, although they changed the ending; it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong. They said the lines but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong they could possibly do. That's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking. Because everything they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from it. And people assume that if I hated it then they'd changed the script...but it wasn't so much they changed it, they executed it in such a ghastly fashion they rendered it unwatchable."" - Joss Whedon on Alien: ResurrectionThis was Whedon's response to accusations that Jean Pierre-Jeunet deviated from the screenplay he had written. These accusations were brought forth by the fact that Whedon expressed his displeasure in the film. In reality he was upset with the fact that he had written the screenplay with a tongue in cheek tone, but in the end the director opted to play the film straight. The result became part of the inspiration for my favorite show from Whedon: Firefly. Needless to say that has gained more acclaim and a greater fan following than Alien: Resurrection.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), having died at the end of Alien3, has been cloned by the corporation 200 years after her death. She's become a blend of alien and human, the soldier that they have been looking for. In turn they have also created new aliens, but when they escape from their holding pin it is up to the alien hybrid Ripley to help a mercenary crew escape from the Auriga ship they are being held captive on.Honestly, I don't get all the hate for Alien: Resurrection. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a great movie but I did enjoy it more than Alien3 and people seem to enjoy that movie much more than this. That's something I've never been quite able to grasp. For me, anytime Ron Perlman is involved in a flick I stand up and take notice, and he does a great job at adding levity to the proceedings here. Sigourney Weaver also seems to be having more fun than she has the entire series as well. She's able to play around with the character she created in the first Alien and evolve, since she's a hybrid, into a somewhat ambiguous character.While Jean Pierre-Jeunet did not completely keep to Whedon's script he still seems to be having fun with the movie. For a guy who codirected flicks like Amelie and Delicatessen, he keeps something of that French tongue in cheek spirit. I think that we as Americans sometimes can't exactly see that for what it is. At the same time though, do we really want that from our Alien movies? Alien and Aliens were brilliant pieces of work that didn't rely on levity in their proceedings, but Alien3 was so dark that it might have required such levity. Either way I think this is still the last decent flick in the series.Looking back on the series I think Alien3 is the weakest link, unfortunately I seem to be in the minority. Alien3 had the benefit of being directed largely by future Oscar nominee David Fincher; whereas Alien: Resurrection was directed by Jean Pierre-Jeunet, who had not directed a flick alone or in English prior to this film (he required a translator on site in order to communicate with the cast). Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon, Perlman, Weaver, and Alien newbie Winona Ryder among a largely entertaining cast help make this film a lot more fun than people like to admit. I recommend this over Alien3, but then again I would recommend all of the Alien flicks to first time watchers. Even at its worst, it's better than most Science Fiction series.3.5/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",Alien Resurrection VHS
1437049,"This movie is basically a mockery of overly religious Christians, yet shows how some God believers actually act. The concept of this movie is basically ""We as Christians are right. You are not. If you are a sinner, the devil will haunt you and you will go to hell."" Within 10-15 minutes of the movie we arrive at Camp Hope with the main character, Tommy Leary. The male campers are given a strict set of ludicrous ""Christian"" rules that include: A dress code policy, no sighing, no comic books, no cell phones, no food, no music, and no 1 on 1 time of any sorts with the female campers. More mockery comes in when the boys' camp counselor is made out to look like a bully who sees the flaws in everyone else but himself.Throughout the course of the movie you you will come across parts that leave you with more questions then answers and will just confuse the heck out of you. Satan also rears his ugly head throughout this film, stalking the campers, but mostly Tommy Leary who seems to be in the Devil's high interests. I will not give away the ending but all I will say is that it once again leaves you with more questions then answers. This is not even really a horror movie.

In this film, also written by MacFarlane, young John Bennett gets an oversized Teddy bear for Christmas.  John is even less popular than the Jewish kids who are beaten up each year by the Christian kids.  He wishes his Teddy would become human and be his lifelong friend.  Bang!  It happens and the two form a bond.Years later as a 35 year old desk clerk for a car rental agency, John still has kid-like tendencies but for his 4 year relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis).  Lori puts an ultimatum to John.  Rambunctious, profane Ted must get his own apartment or she will move on.  This of course doesn't sit well with Ted who enjoys his pot smoking time with John.  Ted (MacFarlane) enjoys the best lines and while they aren't consistent, some are damn funny.  MacFarlane's humor is fast and he doesn't give you much time to absorb it before moving on to the next joke.  I also suspect many of quick hits will sail over some people's heads.Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi are along for the ride as foils for John and Ted.  Sam Jones enlivens a party at Ted's pad.  He of course is from John and Ted's favorite movie ""Flash Gordon"" from 1980.  The bit is funny with some recreated scenes from the film.

1413034,"One doesn't hear much about Maylaya's place in the scheme of things during and after WWII. This film will give you a decent taste of that wrapped up in a strong drama.Here's the scoop. Ferris (Holden), Dhana (Capucine) and Ng (Tanba) have been fighting the Japanese up to the end of the war. With the war over, Ferris buys land and goes into the rubber business. Dhana stays on as a teacher. Ng goes to Moscow and becomes indoctrinated into the ways of Communism only to return later to enforce Maylayan rebels who are trying to kick the Brits out of the country. Dhana is framed to look like a rebel. She won't rat out Ng so Ferris needs to find Ng and turn him in before the noose tightens.This is a decent story decently directed. What it has going for it is the way the characters are written and performed. Holden, and Capucine are really good. Tetsuro Tanba as Ng runs close behind. Susannah York as Candace Trumpey is Okay, but this was still a bit early in her career so she's not quite up to the others. The directing is a bit on the pedestrian side. The action/fight scenes are a bit sloppy and the talk scenes needed a bit more movement in them. The crowd scenes are typical of the time as is the musical score. Those things have gotten so much better in film over the years. Decent use is made of the location in both the villages and the wilds, but overall it's a bit leaden. It also has an interesting ending and, given this was released in 1964 it was a bit ahead of its time. Holden remarks to a British diplomat how they have learned nothing in the centuries they've spent trying to colonize other countries.

1517195,"It is a strange tradition that indie filmmakers with shoestring budgets inevitably want to make science fiction films. One has trouble discerning why; dramas and comedies are far cheaper and period pieces are just as exotic without the need for special effects. Yet the small film maker continues to pound out high-concept science fiction films regardless of their obvious limitations in this regard.Then sometimes one of them knocks it out of the park.The HPLHS already struck gold with Call of Cthulhu, a tremendously faithful 30s expressionist film based on the short story of the same name. With Whisperer they attempt to give a similar treatment to a more narrative Lovecraft story, this time in the trappings of a 1940s talkie. Success in this area is mixed- the feel starts off on target but quickly migrates to the atmosphere of a 60s creature feature... Not that there is anything wrong with that. If anything gives away the film's truly modern nature it is that the photography is a little too clean- again not a problem, and it left me wishing this movie was available on BD as well. The soundtrack is tremendously well done and moody, just like in Call.Without giving too much away, Whisperer follows the short story faithfully until the end at which point it concludes with an action setpiece not present in the original plot. As if by way of apology, the new ending is actually much more grim than the original, placing the protagonist in a much dimmer situation.Just as with Call of Cthulhu, the effects here are far better than the film's small scale would suggest. The alien Mi-go in particular are a wonderfully steampunk mashup of creature and clockwork, realized with a very effective mix of models, costuming and CG. Locations are beautifully shot, and the actors fairly douse the production in character- in particular Daniel Kaemon, who plays the cult leader Mr. Noyse, lapses into a fantastic Mid-Atlantic radio presenter accent when he is (unknowingly?) recorded during his dark rituals- it sounds like it should be corny, yet it is eerily effective.Purists may gape at the liberties taken with the source material, but this is a fantastically solid sci-fi horror flick that is true to the spirit of its source material and for my money far outstrips Lovecraft films with much costlier productions. A must buy if you enjoyed Call, or if you are a fan of old-school horror literature and cinema.

(Just note the Mayor of Chicago recently asked for Federal crime control assistance since the murder rate in the inner-city there is totally out of control; same thing in Scamp&igrave;a.)So really this is a film about the inner-city poverty, survival, life and death in a Mediterranean city slum--(probably could have been filmed in Marseille, too).Worthy of a couple of viewings--probably not more.~~~",Gomorrah

Except for the part in England (they don't how to do R & R), it was very enjoyable & entertaining & how about the remaining Flamingos? It is sad that that the early rockers (Jerry Lee Lewis & Bo Diddley)  weren't given more time (most likely they were edited out) as they WERE Rock & Roll. The cover lists the songs (23) that were played. It is a nice stroll down memory lane, but it still wasn't the same as in the 50's.; but then, what is?  So many of our R & R artists were gone when this show was put together such as: Bill Haley & many of his Comets; Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, LaVern Baker.

TOO MANY GUEST SINGERS.Great:  Alfie, of course.  The man has the voice of an angel.  His ""Bring Him Home"" always brings me to tears.  Also great was Matt Lucas.  As a fan of their ""kitchen concerts"" I wish there was more of Matt.  An appearance by Claude Michel Shoenberg (Not sure of the spelling) was a wonderful gesture.Good:  Alfie's joking with the orchestra was funny, especially when the oboe player messed up.  Poor girl got such abuse from Alfie.  Many of his ""jokes"" were not really funny, or I just don't get British humor.  He seemed nervous at the start, perhaps this should have been filmed at a later concert, but he warmed up as the show went on.Fair:  The little girl who sang was so good and very cute, but we could have done without her.Poor:  Too many guests.  Tom McFly/Fletcher, not sure of his name Alfie calls him both, was okay on the Beatles song but poor on ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables""Terrible:  Talk about too many guests, who ever told Mel C she could sing.  She was bad on the first song and absolutely destroyed ""Come What May.""  It's one of my favorite songs and I find myself fast forwarding through it at this concert.  Considering Laura Wright was at the concert, I would much rather have heard her.  She can sing.Seeing Alfie for myself for the first time in October.  Hoping for lots of Alfie, with no special guests who can't sing.On a side note, why did we have to wait months for this release after the UK release.  Very frustrating.",N/A

1313163,"Ben Affleck's &#34;The Town&#34; is based on Chuck Hogan's book &#34;Prince of Thieves&#34; (later released under the name &#34;The Town&#34; to capitalize on its tie-in to the movie), and it is a remarkably faithful adaptation of a truly engrossing book. I read the book just a couple of weeks before renting the movie, and I often find that this is a recipe for disaster as far as the movie is concerned (it is just very hard to compete with a reader's imagination).Instead, however, I found that actually seeing the familiar Boston landmarks brought the book alive in a very different way. The story is very well translated to screen and the constant tension from the book manifests itself very well on-screen.There are a few notable things in the movie: the late Pete Postlethwaite is typically terrific in a small but powerful role, Jeremy Renner plays a slightly out-of-control character that is very different from his Bourne or Hawkeye characters, and Rebecca Hall is nearly perfect in the role of Claire (vulnerable but strong, pretty but not glamorous). It is also interesting to see Jon Hamm (of Mad Men fame) in a current day role as an FBI agent who shares almost nothing with his Don Draper character on the television show.This is the second of Ben Affleck's movies as a director (&#34;Gone Baby Gone&#34; was first and &#34;Argo&#34; is the third), and it is a terrific piece of work.",N/A
319693,"Man, I was so disappointed by this one.As a completely unabashed lover of Eighties movies, I have been going back to catch a lot of the more obscure pearls from that decade and in the process unearthed some true gems, includingThree O'Clock HighandOne Crazy Summer.  I was really hoping that I was going to be able to add Real Men to that list.  It has a solid cast (who doesn't love John Ritter? And hey, he may be the less-talented Belushi but Jim is a Belushi nonetheless), a completely ludicrous 80's premise (a rendezvous with aliens who want a glass of water), and some funny clips on Youtube.  I was hoping I'd love this one.Unfortunately, the whole production just oozes a half-baked aura, undoubtably the work of a writer/director (Dennis Feldman) who was not ready for prime time.All of the situations feel episodic, the character motivations are murky, and the laughs are MIA.  Mediocre scene after mediocre scene -- Ritter using his finger as a gun, the rendezvous with the Russian agent, the scene with the dominatrix in Pittsburgh, Ritter beating up the burglars, the clowns -- just don't work and are largely humorless.Thus, relegate Real Men to the dubious list of 80's flicks that were lost opportunities (see: Volunteers, Hot Pursuit).",N/A

977783,"When I saw the first scene of the young boy playing a violin in a huge field of golden wheat, I said to myself ""I hate this film, it is trying to be artsy in the way that Bergman was."" However I stuck with it and I must admit that this film departs radically from Bergman in the sense that it doesn't fear to hit you over the head with its heartfelt themes.  It's not subtle!  It does have a message. It veers close to bathos and sometimes falls in.  And yet....there is something so nice about it that I can forgive all of its errors -- sort of like when you have a friend who annoys you and forgets to pay back the money you lent him, wrecks your car and doesn't remember your birthday, but who is so good hearted and loving that you have to love him back.Well, sorta like that.  On a personal level the film appealed to me because all of my grandparents came from small towns in Sweden and I grew up surrounded by Swedes...so these people and their attitudes were very familiar to me.  I had to laugh when they interrupted their intense ""group therapy"" kind of session with a call for coffee!  So if you don't have that backbground, you may be less forgiving of the faults of the film.I do think that what carried me through the obvious and predictable plot were the strong performances.  The lead, Nyquist, was wonderful!  He reminded me a bit of Richard Burton.  Seeing the joy break through his initial frozen personality was really a pleasure.  His love interest, the angelic Lena, was every bit his match. She was the moral heart of the story.  Her innate strenth, warmth and goodness, as well as her physical beauty, were wonderful to see. The world needs more people like Lena!I've read all of the low rated reviews and I have to say that I agree with many of the points they make.  I did object to the terrible stereotype the film gives the poor pastor. I'm not sure I liked the handling of the retarded boy either.  And I did find the Austrian trip and the ending much sappier than I would have liked.  But still the film left me with a happy feeling, and that's not a bad thing!I recommend this for those who are not afraid to feel good.

771764,"Rosemary & Thyme is a British mystery series staring Felicity Kendal (Good Neighbors, The Camomille Lawn) and Pam Ferris (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Matilda) as gardening detectives. I first saw Felicity Kendal in Good Neighbors and fell in love with her sense of humor and personality. I was thrilled to find out that she brings that same down to earth personality to Rosemary & Thyme.  Rosemary & Thyme  was first aired on British television in 2003 and ran until August 2007.Both women are avid gardeners who are somehow embroiled in a bunch of different mysteries.  Laura Thyme (Pam Ferris) is the daughter of a farmer and former police woman who loves her home garden. Her husband recently left her for another woman so she has extra time on her hands. Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal) has a degree in plant pathology and was recently laid off from her University job by her underhanded ex-beau.The series begins with Rosemary investigating some dying trees at the home of a friend.  Laura's husband has just left her for a younger woman and she finds herself in the same hotel as Rosemary.  They meet and uncover a plot to kill Rosemary's friend.  Rosemary and Thyme consider themselves gardeners more than they consider themselves detectives.  The mysteries just happen to occur where they are solving a gardening problem or creating a new garden and they get involved in finding clues for the mystery as well.  I love how  naturally each of these mysteries unravels.  It's very easy to think of these women as *just like you* especially since they are average middle aged women and not your typical Barbie doll style actress. The two women's personalities mesh together perfectly as friends.Most of the episodes take place in various manor houses and gardens in England however some are shot in other countries as well.  Just a few of the more famous locations include London's Kew Gardens and Regent's Park; the French Riveria; Italy's Ligurian coast; a Surrey vineyard; and the hills of Malaga, Spain.  Being able to see all of these lovely, exotic gardens was one of the reasons that I enjoyed these mysteries so much.  If you're a gardener yourself or someone who loves to watch travel programs, you'll want to watch this series just for the pleasure of seeing the different locations. If you're also a fan of British mysteries, all the better. You'll find this show a delightful break from the violence and reality shows on television now.Rosemary & Thyme: The Complete Collection includes all 22 episodes on 7 discs.  There is approximately 18 1/2 hours of viewing time.  Series 1 ran in 2003.  Series 2 ran in 2004.  Series 3 ran from 2005 to 2007.

536378,"The late movie for last night was ""Bridgit Jones's Diary"" starring Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Huge Grant. I found the movie on our DVD shelves and it must have been there by the action of my separated wife. I have trouble watching sappy romance movies, and she loves them. In any case, Zellweger was the main character (Bridget) and played an unmarried mid-thirties woman who was becoming ever more apprehensive about her situation. Her two off - again, on-again love interests were Hugh Grant (a dork hampered with a dour personality), who she met at one of her mother's social gatherings, and Colin Firth (Mr. Smooth)  who was her supervisor at the office where she worked. Yaawwwnnnn! Neither didn't seem to go very well and neither was convincing. She hated Grant, so Firth turned out to be first in line and all was going well until he was discovered playing around with a high-powered lawyer. Next came Grant. Oh yes, somewhere along the line, in a non-convincing little side plot, her mother gave her father the boot for a seedy on-screen television salesman. Alas, then Grant seemed to have problems with the same lawyer. Ho-hum. Life in London is so complicated.The movie was well produced and flowed along at a nice rate.

931299,"Here's a bit of odd and titillating 70's exploitation for all the grindhouse fans out there.  Sex and Fury, starring the lovely Reiko Ike and Swedish sexpot Christina Lindberg, is certainly full of both sex AND fury, with Reiko, as the gambler and pickpocket Ocho, out to revenge the death of her detective father, murdered in front of her twenty years earlier. Her only clue to the identity of the killers is the images on three playing cards that her father was holding as he died; a deer, a boar, and a butterfly.  Sub-plots featuring star-crossed lovers, agents provocateurs, and virgins sold into prostitution elevate the movie out of one dimension, though I think the story gets a little too busy for its own good.  Still, director Noribumi Suzuki gets in plenty of nudity and violence, along with some really surprising and startling imagery that seems especially effective considering that my expectations for this flick were limited to ... well, sex and fury, I guess.As this was the first movie I've seen that falls into the `pinky violence' genre, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Movie censors in Japan during the 70's prohibited full frontal nudity, and while many of Sex and Fury's sex scenes were probably quite risqu&eacute; at the time, they seem somewhat clumsy now; those viewers who place prime importance on that aspect may be disappointed.  As for the violence, stylistically, I think it was ahead of its time, though movies have caught up and surpassed it since.  What is noteworthy about this movie in particular is its use of sex and violence in the service of a linear (if convoluted) plot, its lurid and colorful cinematography, and the bizarre S&M; imagery in the final third of the film.  This is a movie whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Not without its flaws (which are mostly slow spots while the plot is advanced, a music score that sounds as if it were done by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, and the limitations of special effects of the time), I still highly recommend this one to anyone who enjoys exploitation cinema and oddball films from the 70's.This Synapse release is an excellent transfer; I didn't notice any artifacts or age issues with the print at all, although I did watch it on a small screen.

1365921,"Remakes are all the fashion in Hollywood the past decade, in all genres from horror to action to romance and westerns.  This remake of a John Wayne classic is quite good itself, and contrary to its previews and ad campaigns, is probably closer to a western-comedy hybrid than a drama or action movie within a western context.  Yes, I said comedy.  Most of the movie is spent on dialogue with only about 15 minutes of real action.  And it is the dialogue that provides the comedy.  Jeff Bridges plays a drunk whose slurred speech is filled with great one-liners while Matt Damon plays an over-talkative law officer, and their relationship throughout the movie alludes to that famous TV show The Odd Couple.  Josh Brolin is perfect as the villain, both in look, talk and style.  The lead actress, and the role around which the movie revolves is Hailee Steinfield.  Playing a bright, precocious, and wily teenage girl out for revenge, she out-thinks and out-duels one man after another over the course of the movie.

The film's monsters fight and wreck havoc at night, giving a more realistic look; as opposed to most of the Gamera films to follow in the daytime and lacking in the special effects department (this is due to decreasing of budgets, as the series went on).As mentioned in the title of this review, however, Gamera is not in the film very much. Surprisingly, Barugon is given most of the screen-time and the destruction of it's ice-spraying tongue and rainbow-ray that emits from it's back are rather impressive to watch.The dam attack by Gamera, as he lands back to Earth in the beginning of the film, is well-done and the final battle between the two creatures is one of the most intense and bloody ones ever filmed in the Showa series.It's strange that the Gamera films, following this film, began to be geared to children, yet they became more gory in the action scenes (something that was rarely seen in most Godzilla films, until the 1970's).Now, the design of Barugon is not very menacing ( kinda looks like a horned-chameleon), but as a Gamera villian, it's one of the better monster designs that was seen in the Showa era. It looked closer to something that couldve come from a Toho film.As I mentioned, Gamera is not in the film very much, so be prepared, but at least this film didn't have any kids as main human characters.If you're a Gamera fan or a kaiju fan in general, this is definitely worth picking up and adding to your collection. It's a shame though that most of the Gamera films that followed (after, ""Gamera vs. Gaos""), were less impressive in their productions.",N/A
841167,"Edgar Wright's cult classic Shaun of the Dead follows the titular Shaun (Simon Pegg), a nice salesman who feels as though his life is going nowhere. His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is disappointed in his lack of ambition. Shaun's best friend Ed (Nick Frost) epitomizes this arrested development. Ed's simian humor (he literally imitates gorillas) amuses Shaun to no end, but leaves their other roommate, Shaun's girlfriend, and her judgmental roommates Diane and Dylan (Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran) cold.In the midst of his personal problems, Shaun finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Is this his chance to find his inner strength and get his life together? That is, if he survives?This comedy has amusing and surreal moments of silliness and satire, but its humor isn't for everyone. For those whose funny bone it doesn't strike, the film's strength comes from its metaphors. Shaun feels stuck in his routines, held back and a little dead inside--not unlike a zombie. In fact, the drones populating the city of London already resemble the living dead. Shaun is so oblivious to his fellow humans and the world around him, he hardly realizes an epidemic is upon them.Our hero's journey from overlooked ""loser"" to courageous leader is also satisfying. He finds himself torn between the well-intended but prepubescent friend of his youth and his girlfriend's affections. This is as much a relationship film as it is a horror movie.There are some bloody moments, though. Horror and horror-spoof fans will enjoy watching the nonplussed Shaun and his best mate battle zombies. Others might find the film diverting but not particularly memorable. Many might connect to a man in his thirties who is trying to find himself--zombie infestation or no.",Shaun of the Dead

I thought it would be some kind of real Elvis tribute or something.Lucky for me, my interest had been piqued by its all star cast and large budget for that time.WOW! what a great crime action film. It is an interesting mix of brutal crime action peppered with just enough comedy to keep it from being too dark. Yes, there is plenty of violence and senseless murder (not a movie for kids or tweens), but the interplay between Russel and Cox, and Costner's frustrated determination keep the film fun. It has plenty of twists that will hold your interest all the way to a satisfying ending. The movie didn't do well at the box office or with critics, but don't be fooled...3000 Miles to Graceland is a ""sleeper"" of a crime action film that delivers nicely.",3000 Miles to Graceland
1399449,"This is by far the best film of 2011. It reminded me of movies like close encounters of the third kind, stand by me, and  the goonies. It had a 70's or 80's feel to it; you know back in the golden era of modern cinema that was shaped by the likes of GEORGE LUCAS, FRANCES FORD COPALA and the GOD of a man, the best film maker of all time who produced the film I am critiquing right now, STEVEN SPIELBERG. What more can I say except buy this DVD you wont be disappointed. The sound track by, Michael Giacchino is also great very much in the vain of JOHN WILLIAMS. Giacchino also scored such works as, JJ ABRAMS ""STAR TREK"" and the upcoming ""star trek sequel"", ""the incredible's"", the show ""lost"", ""ratatouille"", ""john carter"" and the video games ""MEDAL OF HONOR"" AND ""MEDAL OF HONOR 2"", One last thing the kids in this could really act I am surprised none of them were up for Oscars especially Elle Fanning, who if you didn't know is Dakota Fanning's little sister.",N/A
1510748,"In spite of its mixed messages about female sexuality, What's Your Number is surprisingly funny and even touching. Anna Faris plays Ally who hopes to find a date to her sister Daisy's (Ari Graynor) wedding. After reading that most women who have twenty or more sexual partners never settle down, she is determined that her next lay be ""the one."" To prevent raising the number of men she's slept with, Ally enlists the help of her philandering neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) to track down her exes hoping they improved over time.One of the film's problems is its unintentional similarities to the superior Bridesmaids. The heroine has mixed feelings about a wedding, meets a man who encourages her to follow her artistic sensibilities, and struggles with unemployment. (""Struggles"" is an overstatement; considering their financial situations, these characters have remarkable apartments.) Even the opening scene contains a gag that is nearly identical to one in Bridesmaids.Still, the movie is more irreverent and amusing than most romantic comedies. Farris is hilarious as Ally, a young woman who makes many mistakes but never runs out of optimism. Evans is fairly appealing as Colin, the obligatory rogue with a heart of gold. Since he admits that he can hardly spend time with a woman without trying to sleep with her, she doesn't consider him an option. Instead, she rendezvous with an assortment of ex-boyfriends and flings, played by a pleasing array of actors. A large part of the movie's appeal consists of her awkward interactions with men played by familiar faces such as Joel McHale, Chris Pratt, Zachary Quinto, Martin Freeman, and Anthony Mackie.The film also focuses on Ally's relationship with her family. She feels out of place with her more conventional sister and perfectly coiffed mother, in spite of their close relationships. All this, of course, channels towards her inevitable lesson about love and being herself. Many women will identify with her grapples with relationship advice, the media, and questions about a ""normal"" modern woman's sexual appetites. The movie touches on the thin line between giving someone a chance and trying to force a relationship.Unfortunately, the movie undermines some of its more progressive themes. It certainly includes sexist stereotypes, not to mention weightism. Ally is meant to be a disaster, but she often looks perfect and is shot sexually. (To be fair, Colin is naked throughout most of the movie.) When it comes down to it, though Ally doesn't fit into the film world, she is still a man's ideal woman. She isn't high maintenance, enjoys watching and playing sports (in one scene, she engages in a sexy one-on-one basketball game--in her underwear), and is up for almost anything.There are definitely moments where the film crosses the line into poor taste. The whole thing is difficult to take seriously. The ""comedic"" music makes the movie feel as though it should have a laugh track. But What's Your Number ultimately conveys the ""life is messy: embrace it"" message with (mostly) good-natured humor.",What's Your Number

Young Owen Wilson has the lead role, plays the part of a writer with girlfriend problems and job problems...all comic ones...same as Woody when he used to star in his own movies.Documentary part of the DVD I got shows Woody at a press conference in 2011 at Cannes, and his looks very fragile and unhealthy...his skin is very yellow and pasty looking, and one eye looks bad, like a man who had a stroke...and his speech isn't clear at times......but...he keeps on going like old man river.He really is one of the great figures in cinema....like D. W. Griffith, I think. I met him face to face in NYC in 1972 at a place where he played his clarinet several times weekly with the house jazz band...called ""Michael's Pub"" as I remember. I was living in Manhattan then, selling educational movies....had a jazzy apt. in the easy 60's near the place where Woody played...went to see him one afternoon with a girlfriend who knew about it. He talked about the Mets baseball team.Woody is very important...made 41 films since TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN in 1968...... Woody made that movie in SF CALIF on almost no money!-----------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor.",N/A

1554138,"I had high expectations for this set when it was announced last year. When I learned that CM Punk would have a great deal of creative input in the project, my expectations sky-rocketed. Now that ""CM Punk: Best in the World"" has arrived on our shelves, I can honestly say that my expecations have been met and far exceeded. In fact, this is one of the top 5 releases that WWE has ever put out.The nearly two hour documentary begins with a quote from CM Punk with no backround music, which I feel sets the tone for the feature extremely well. Punk openly discusses his rough childhood and his father's alcoholism, which inspired Punk to become straight edge. Punk's adoptive family, childhood friends, and even an ex-girlfriend provide great insight and perspective to CM Punk as a young man.Punk's early days as a backyard wrestler are discussed next. I was not aware of this phase of Punk's career, so it was a blast seeing all the old footage that WWE was able to get their hands on. We move on to Punk's days on the independent wrestling circut. His friendship with Colt Cabana, their chemistry, and their matches in IWA are discussed, as his TLC match with Chris Hero that many feel started the ball rolling for Punk. Cabana and Hero are both interviewed here, as is Punk's trainer, Ace Steel, and it's great to hear from people who were in ther ring with Punk in his early days. His time in Ring of Honor is discussed next. His early feud with Raven and his matches with Samoa Joe are highlighted before the initial ""Summer of Punk"" is talked about. We learned how Punk wanted to mess with the ""smart fans"" who found out about Punk signing with WWE and figured he'd be leaving the company. Instead, Punk won the ROH Heavyweight title and proceeded to sign his WWE contract on the belt. All told, Punk's indy career is given about 30 minutes, which is great to see in a WWE produced dvd.Punk's days in OVW and ECW are discussed next. Paul Heyman, John Cena, Michael Hayes, and Triple H are interviewed and without spoiling any of the stories, this portion sheds great light on the backstage politics that took place during Punk's early WWE tenture. You can really get a feel for Punk (and Heyman's) frustrations.Punk's two MITB and World Heavyweight Championship are discussed. Punk talks very candidly about his feelings on his ill-fated first title run and his much better second reign. Punk talks about his fantastic feud with Jeff Hardy before running into the Undertaker and promptly tumbled down the card.Punk talks about the Sraight Edge Society next. The group was Punk's idea and you can clearly tell he had a blast leading the SES. Joey Mercury tells a very personal story about Punk bringing him back to WWE. Unfortunately, WWE didn't know what to do with the SES and Punk was once again directionless.Punk's backstage issues are talked about next, leading up to his infamous ""pipe bomb"" promo. The promo is shown in full (which is awesome) and it's cool to learn about the backstage mood after the promo. Money in the Bank 2011 and Punk resigning with WWE close out the documentary.Overall, this is one of the best documentaries that WWE has ever produced. It's paced well and you get the feeling that everyone interviewed was being 100% genuine with their feelings (which is a feeling I don't always get from WWE dvds). To me, it ranks just behind Edge's ""You Think You Know Me?"" as the best WWE doc.Also included are about 30 minutes of bonus features that discuss things like Punk's in-ring style, December to Dismember, his  OVW feud with Brent Albright and his worst ever injury. All of the bonus features are worth watching and feel like they could have easily been included in the main feautre without issue.Disc two and three contain matches hand-picked by CM Punk himself. While some will no doubt be familiar, there's not a match that feels out of place, as the tell the (WWE story) of Punk's in-ring career.vs. Brent Alright for the vacant OVW Heavyweight Championship (OVW. 03/01/06) A solid match from Punk's time in OVW. Albright (who I am not familiar with) and Punk have great chemistry and put on a hard hitting match. A bizarre injury angle almost ruins the match for me, but the in-ring action is too solid to ignore. 2.5/5vs Justin Credible ( ECW TV. 08/01/06) Basic tv match that was Punk's introduction to WWE. Punk's pre-match promo is shown beforehand. Nothing special in this match. Credible dominates much of the match before Punk hit's his running knee and slaps on the Anaconda Vice for the win. 2/5Last Chance Match for the ECW Championship - vs John Morrison (ECW TV. 9/04/07) Punk said on the dvd that his is one of his best matches. I'm not sure about that but it is a great match. Both men worked fast and agressive and showed off their impressive athleticism. The match goes back and forth before Punk nails a GTS to win the belt. 3.5/5Money in the Bank Match - vs Chris Jericho, Carlito, Shelton Benjamin, John Morrison, MVP & Mr. Kennedy (Wresltemania 24. 03/30/08) Great spot-fest that is non-stop action. Shelton Benjamin is the MVP of the match with his crazy bumping ability. Great climax to the match with Punk and Jericho on top of the ladder. 4/5World Tag Team Championship Match - w/Kofi Kingston vs Ted DiBiase & Cody Rhodes (Raw. 10/27/08) Punk and Kofi are friends in real life so it's no surprise that they have great chemistry as a team (as do DiBiase & Rhodes.) It's a typical tag match, with the faces getting in early offense before the heels dominate the majority of the match. Kofi gets the hot tag to Punk and we have new Tag Team Champions. 2.5/5No DQ Match for the Intercontinental Championship - vs William Regal (Raw. 01/19/09) Taking place from Chicago, Regal and Punk worked a hard hitting match for the IC strap. These two have great chemistry and it would be great to see what they could do with 20+ minutes. Still, a great tv match. 3/5TLC Match for the World Heavyweight Championship - vs Jeff Hardy (Summerslam. 08/23/09) One of my favorite matches ever and arguably the best (one on one) TLC match of all time. Both Hardy and Punk bumped their asses off and combined great storytelling with amazing spots. Just a great match. 5/5Rey Joins the SES vs CM Punk's Hair - vs Rey Mysterio (Over the Limit. 05/23/10) Mysterio and Punk always put on great matches together and this gem is no exception. The match is hurt by Punk getting busted open in the beginning and match being stopped while he was stiched up (it's wrestling, WWE. Blood is ok sometimes). But, once they got going, these two worked a blistering match. The fact that Mysterio wins irks me a little, but the post-match shenanigans are included. 3.5/5WWE Championship Match - vs John Cena (Money in the Bank. 07/17/11) Simply put, one of the best matches ever. The crowd reaction, the in-ring action, the fact that you never knew who was going to win and the of course, the ending, all add up to the perfect package. An all-time, top-ten match. 5/5WWE Championship Match - vs Chris Jericho (Wrestlemania 28. 04/01/12) Two of my favoirte wrestlers of all-time go toe-to-toe at Wrestlemania for the title. The match starts slow but builds to an exciting climax. There was no way a match with Chris Jericho and CM Punk was going to be bad and this match was a wrestling purist's dream 5/5WWE Championship Match - vs Daniel Bryan (Over the Limit. -5/20/12) These two know each other extremely well and used that fact to their advantage to put on a wrestling clinic. If you've watched these two hook up in ROH, you'll appreciate the sublte callbacks to their previous matches. Fantastic match. 5/5Overall verdict: An engrossing documentary, entertaining bounus features, and a no-dud match listing easily make this one of the best dvd sets ever produced by WWE. WWE have been on a roll with their dvd sets latley (Randy Orton's, Steve Austin's, The Rock's, and Edge's dvds all come to mind) and ""CM Punk: Best in the World"" continues the trend. A definite must-buy. 5/5",N/A

She embodies the complicated, subtle malice of a woman gone mad and Hell-bent on wreaking slow vengeance on the world, and the male sex in particular.

1518452,"Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011)Drama, 102 minutesDirected by Sean DurkinStarring Elizabeth Olsen, Sarah Paulson and John HawkesI don't like to read reviews before I see a film for the first time, but my curiosity was piqued when so many critics named Martha Marcy May Marlene among their favorite films from 2011.For some reason, I expected the story to be about a woman with multiple personality disorder. That wasn't the case, but identity is one of the main themes.This is a film that will alienate a lot of potential viewers. The plot is non-linear and often transitions quickly from Martha's memories to her present reality. There's also a lot of nudity and a small amount of sex. Both are essential to the plot.Martha (Olsen) is in her early 20s and we see her join a cult in the first five minutes of the film. She's uncertain of her role at first, but soon begins to feel like part of the community. The cult is led by Patrick (Hawkes) and he is quietly persuasive. He gradually asserts his will over the other cult members and sleeps with the women. He thinks that Martha looks more like a Marcy May, so that becomes her name while she is a member of the cult.The story deals with Martha's attempt to rejoin society after she decides to escape from the cult. She makes a phone call to her older sister, Lucy (Paulson), who picks her up and invites her to stay with her and her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy). The scene involving the phone call is accompanied by some disquieting music reminiscent of a David Lynch film. In fact, with Martha seemingly capable of almost anything, you won't feel comfortable at any point in the film. You're not supposed to.Martha has no idea of how to behave in normal society. She's used to sleeping in a room filled with other cult members and feels isolated when she's alone. Her time as a member of the cult has also affected the way she eats and drinks. She thinks nothing of swimming naked or walking in when her sister is having sex. This is perfectly acceptable behavior in her mind after her recent experiences.The film regularly shows a scene in the present and then cuts to a scene in the recent past to illustrate the difference between Martha's two worlds. I know plenty of friends who would be irritated by the choice to tell the story in such a manner, but I think it works. It reminds me of Memento in some ways because Martha's experiences feel more immediate if we see things from her viewpoint.I also found myself thinking about the lifestyles we choose. Lucy and Ted are typical of most people. They judge success in terms of money and possessions and take great pride in their house. When Martha says it's too big for two people, they explain that they like to entertain. They clearly want to be viewed as successful by their friends. That point is highlighted when they plan a party. Lucy dresses Martha in some of her clothes and fixes her hair. She tells Martha she looks beautiful. But the reason she does it is not to make Martha feel special, but to show her friends how wonderful her younger sister is.There's a sense of unease throughout the film because it's possible that the cult could look for Martha. She even asks at one point how far away their house is from the place Lucy picked her up. Does she fear being recaptured, or does she have some other purpose in mind and is wondering how far she will have to travel to rejoin them?I think that's more than enough information about the plot, except to say that the conclusion is completely open-ended. You'll have to make up your own mind about Martha's future. I haven't mentioned who Marlene is, but it's fairly obvious when you watch the film.The acting is particularly convincing. Hawkes does a great job of quietly asserting his authority over the group and even sings a song for Marcy May. Olsen delivers an outstanding breakthrough performance and will surely pick up some other good roles because of this film. Along with Ellen Page, she'll be a popular choice when a movie requires a character in her early 20s.I found myself thinking about the film the day after I saw it and that's usually a good sign. I think it's one of those stories which will assume greater significance on repeat viewings and I'm interested to see where Sean Durkin takes us with his next project.",Martha Marcy May Marlene
1142335,"I bought this according to all the great reviews.  I also figured that since Jet Li was in it that I could overlook Jackie Chan.  Nothing against Jackie Chan's skills, just his acting and choice of films which I have never enjoyed.  I am rating the movie, not Jackie Chan.Let me front load this by saying that I am not a fan of Jackie Chan.  Never have been.  So if my martial arts comedy standards may be a bit different from yours but I want to be perfectly honest about this.  After watching Chan's last movie The Forbidden Kingdom I can safely say I never will watch him willingly again.  I relented to watch after a 15 year fast from his last movie and was immediately sorry I had gone back on my word.BO-RING.  Cheesy bad, all around insulting to kung fu fan's everywhere.  I figured if I fast forwarded to the fight scene with Li/Chan that I would at least feel like I didn't waste my money on this.  I figured wrong.  It was an exercise in annoyance.It makes me wonder if all these reviews are fake.  I've always trusted Amazon.  I bought this on Amazon based on the reviews which I question now if they are legitimate or just people paid to give a good review who probably didn't pay for the dvd like I did.

The picture and sound was bright, clear, and thank goodness with a production this good. I have a 63 inch Samsung Plasma and a good sound system.There are some very long reviews here, so no need to repeat what has already been said.For me, the topper was at the end of the performace, ALW was on stage and brought out most of the original cast.  Most of the former Phantoms performed along with Sarah Brightman.  They are still fabulous.  Michael Crawford was also there but didn't perform.  Does anyone know why?  He mouthed one word at the end with the others.One of the reviewers said that Sarah Brightman shunned ALW on stage.  I didn't see that at all.  Also he mentioned her voice had diminished.  I admit she looked a bit older and put a little of her weight back,(sounds like me)but I thought her voice was still great.This is the best 22.00 I ever spent.One last thing that doesn't have much to do with this show.  The soundtrack is DTS Master as is most of the newer blu rays.  Is it me or does it seem that movies with action scenes, or music come out loud and clear, bur the dialogue has disproportionally low volume?

Systems are malfunctioning, many of the operational staff are either dead or missing, and somthing on the ship is hunting them. They realize that they have precious little time to get the ship's reactor functional again before they completely lose all power and hope of survival.

286815,"(The following contains very slight spoilers)Those films which were based on novels during Hollywood's golden age typically made huge changes from the original texts, very often with little of the original story remaining. And this picture is par for the course; oh, it's still recognisable as Jane Austen's story, but it can't be said to be a faithful adaptation in any way. (In fact, this script isn't actually based on the book itself; it's an adaptation of a stage play that was based on the book.) As an example of the changes made----the story was updated to the early Victorian era and the bulk of the plot has been pared to the bone or scrapped entirely to fit the tale into a two-hour running time. While the story is moderately faithful to the source material at the beginning (though simplified for time constraints), it runs off the rails about fifty minutes in and from there goes its own way, culminating with the surprising revelation, at the end, that Lady Catherine is secretly nice! (Shocking, I tell you!)Still, taken on its own terms as a cinematic experience, the film is enjoyable enough. The question is, why doesn't it bother me that such liberties were taken with the story in this 1940 version, when I was utterly disgusted and repulsed by the 2005 version for similar liberties? Well, perhaps it's because that, given the time period in which this film was made, I wasn't expecting a faithful adaptation in the first place. Also, this film does at least contain some of the comedy and wit of the novel; elements that are totally lacking in the 2005 version.So, don't look to this film for an faithful adaptation of the original story; it's more to be enjoyed for the cast of well-known golden age Hollywood actors who populate the major and minor roles. And so I'll give it a moderate recommendation for those who enjoy classic cinema.A couple addenda: MGM in-house composer Herbert Stothart wrote the music for this film. He was well-known for borrowing bits of classical music for use in his film scores (perhaps sometimes to excess), and here he used a piece from Modest Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" in the score. It's called ""Ballad of the Unhatched Chicks,"" and it's used as Mrs Bennet's theme song---this is actually rather amusing and a good fit for the character!The early Victorian-era costumes in this film are quite lavish and opulent---though of course completely different in appearance from the Regency clothing that would have been appropriate if the film's time period hadn't been changed. It simply isn't true, however, that costumes from ""Gone with the Wind"" were re-used in this picture (as has often been reported). Apart from the fact that the gowns make use of the crinoline, the style of the dresses in these two films is completely different .... (Though, it should be added, that the men's clothes don't quite match the women's in regards to time period; there really was no attempt made to perfectly recreate a very specific era.)This is a difficult one to rate---three stars seems a bit low, but I honestly didn't like it enough to give it four stars.",N/A

1184347,"In the `50's and `60's there was a huge surge in interest for spy and espionage movies. After the Nazi threat had ended at the end of the World War 2, the Red Scare began and everyone thought eyes were everywhere. It was in 1953 that James Bond first appeared in Ian Fleming's novels and in 1962 Sean Connery immortalized him on the big screen. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. became a hit in 1964, and by this time the spy boom had become big enough to warrant a parody. It was with that in mind that Talent Associates approached Mel Brooks (The Producers) and Buck Henry (The Graduate) to create a spy spoof TV show.In my home growing up the `50's and `60's were always playing on television. Here I became well versed in the cinematic exploits of John Wayne through films like El Dorado and McLintock! Back in the day when Nick at Nite, and later TV Land, actually played shows from before I was born rather than stuff that I recall watching when it first aired (making me feel really old) we would watch shows like Mister Ed, Dennis the Menace, The Munsters, I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched, etc. The favorite show around the house was The Andy Griffith Show. It was during this time that I became enamored with Brooks and Henry's creation Get Smart.Get Smart follows a bungling secret agent named Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) who works for the secret spy organization CONTROL as he fights the secret spy organization KAOS which is based out of Bucharest, Romania but says it's out of Delaware for tax purposes. Despite being somewhat inept Max is the top spy at CONTROL, largely thanks to his much more competent female partner Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and the fact that the spies at KAOS are equally inept. Together Max and 99 fight foes like Mr. Big (Michael Dunn), Siegfried (Bernie Kopell), The Claw (Leonard Strong, and often pronounced Dr. Craw), and Simon the Likeable (Jack Gilford) who is so likeable that no one can resist his charms.Okay, let's be honest, I'm sure none of you out there considered the idea that Get Smart would place #1 on my top 10 TV shows list. Hell, TV in the 60's wasn't even respected as it is today and I'm a critical kind of guy; of course, the fact that TV wasn't respected doesn't mean that it didn't pump out some brilliant shows. The Andy Griffith Show was a brilliant show and before Lost there was Gilligan's Island (yeah, I went there), but neither show was on the same level of Get Smart. I also enjoy any show that works to subvert the already established order, and at that time, when this was largely Brooks's baby back before he even made a flick, this show changed some of the rules of television.At the time comedies still focused a lot on family, so there was interest from the producers to give the show some heart by adding scenes with Max's family. This, of course, was nixed by Brooks, and as a result never in the series do we meet Max's parents. There was also a request for a lovable dog to be added to the series. This request was accepted in the form of the lazy and inept spy dog Fang, which worked for comedic effect. There was also the fact that Maxwell Smart is quite an idiot, which was something that was new for this kind of show. Brooks turned the idea of what a half hour sitcom was and changed it up, but not without a little bit of turmoil. When being shopped around to networks ABC rejected it for being un-American.In the end Smart would have the last laugh though. It ran its first four seasons on NBC, and switched over to CBS for its final season. Throughout its run it earned Emmy awards for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Comedy for Don Adams three years in a row, Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy, Outstanding Comedy Series two years in a row, and Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy. In 1989, ABC would air a direct to TV movie titled Get Smart, Again, and in 1995 the series was rebooted on Fox with Don Adams reprising his role as Maxwell Smart acting as chief of CONTROL and Andy Dick playing his bungling son. While the reboot of the series was nowhere near the excellence of the original series, it did make Get Smart the first show to appear on all four of the major TV networks.5/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",Get Smart: The Complete Series Gift Set
1364485,"I suppose the idea that corporate greed should be interesting, and in the case of ""The Company Men"" (and also ""Margin Call""), some great characters are on hand to expose it all. I enjoyed both films, due to fine acting, writing and direction. Indeed, Ben Affleck carries the film well, with very able support from the always reliable Tommy Lee Jones. There's a little more integrity in this film than in its subsequent co-film, and there's more back story about the characters.Still, it was hard to wrap my head around the idea that these poor put-upon millionaires couldn't manage their finances. I know a lot of people who lost their jobs unfairly, and their story will always hit a more personal nerve than any film about privileged money-mongers.Still, I admire the achievements of the film-makers.",N/A

248340,"Without question the worst movie I've ever seen, and not even in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. It's ninety minutes of sheer torture, starring a hideous cast of makeup nightmares; indisputable evidence of the lengths a commercial property can stretch for the almighty dollar. Like most children of the eighties, I had a healthy collection of GPK stickers in my closet growing up. The gross-out humor and macabre illustrations were a big selling point, but beneath all that was a creative core and a wild amount of versatility. Every card was completely different. The one-note comedy of their film translation, though, is like opening a pack filled with duplicates. I counted six jokes with a visual punchline of ""and then he peed his pants."" That's not an exaggeration, and it's not the only example of the flick's careless comedic redundancy. Combine that with an appalling song and dance number (seriously), a horribly out-of-place romantic subplot (starring a pre-pubescent boy and a girl well into her twenties, no less) and a gang of foils cut clumsily from recycled cardboard. It's genuinely amazing this ever saw the light of day.",N/A

671457,"The Penalty (1920) revolves around the story of a young boy who, though a accident, has his legs mistakenly amputated by a doctor. The boy grows up to be Blizzard (Chaney), a tough, ruthless mobster and crime lord. With bitterness and hatred consuming his character, Blizzard plans to exact revenge on the Dr.Farris, the one who cut off his legs many years ago. Blizzard also plans to cause mayhem and destruction within an all out takeover of the city with his henchmen's assistance.Lon Chaney really fit his title of the man of a thousand faces, taking on various roles and bringing so much life to his roles. He had that ability to transform himself into his character in a way that is unmatched. In The Penalty, he has that sinister, grotesque kind of role he seemed to be perfect for.  As the character, Blizzard, there is something about that wicked, cruel smile that says infinitely more than words could possibly capture, as if the wheels of his mind are spinning with plans of revenge.  Chaney's character is personified by his hatred toward his fate. At one point, Chaney's character shows up for an advertisement for a model who might ""resemble Satan.""The movie's title, at first, appears to be a reference to Chaney's plan, but this is a bit misleading, as there is a twist at the end. Some have commented that they didn't like the ending, but I thought it was a great way to finish the film.There are other great aspects to this film.  The Penalty uses heavy doses of expressionism to tell the story, and a music score that is eerie and bizarre. The restoration and quality of picture is superb; it is hard to believe that this film is over ninety years old. There are a few rare gems and extras worth checking out also, such as ""Chaney's Secrets Revealed"", a look the tricks and techniques used by Chaney.This silent film is definitely worth a viewing!",N/A

91671,"This is the film that really turned Batman into a serious vigilante and made Batman into a dark/reclusive personality instead of being extremely campy and cheesey. Tim Burton is what made this film the masterpiece that it is because he created a gothic-tone for everything in the film and made sure that Batman was as brooding and intimidating as possible. This is the best Batman suit model I've ever seen, it shows that Batman means business and is a force to be reckoned with. Micheal Keaton plays the introspective Bruce Wayne nicely but when he becomes Batman he is a commanding force that you can't take your eyes off of. Jack Nicholson played the Joker perfectly, breeding classy with psychotic like it's nothing. Kim Basinger is a role that's just there but doesn't hinder the key components. Tim Burton also created a Gotham City that looked truly dark and gothic and dangerous and gave it like a 1940's gangster feel similar to the original comic book. This is the movie that launched Tim Burton into the mainstream and made him iconic and legendary. Danny Elfman's score is one of the best movie scores I've ever heard.A lot of people would argue that I'm wrong and that this isn't the best Batman movie ever made. It's true that movie's like ""The Dark Knight"" are very good movies but that movie and the others can never match this because this wasn't just a movie; it was a visual piece of art also that set the bar for decades to come.If you have never seen this, watch it immediately ha.If you love this movie, you know what I was babbling about.",N/A

1400137,"Based on the fist Stephanie Plum novel, published in 1994, by bestselling author Janet Evanovich, Katherine Heigl steps into Plum's shoes as her life has been turned upside down when she become unemployed. With nowhere else to turn to, she takes a job at her cousin Vinnie's Bail Bond as a bail enforcement agent, aka a bounty hunter.Her first assignment is to bring in a former vice cop Joe Morelli, who just happens to be her ex-boyfriend from high school. And she might have tried to hit him with a car. She is determined to bring him in, but in the process stumbles upon the real killer.I recall seeing a few advertisements early in the year for One For the Money, mostly with the funny dinner scenes with Debbie Reynolds. After being panned by critics, getting a 2% rating on rottentomatoes.com, and flopping at the box-office, I had no intention of ever seeing this movie. I happened to stumbled upon the DVD last week for under fifteen dollars and I noticed Life on Mars's Jason O'Mara was in it, so I thought I would give it a try. With no expectations, I actually enjoyed the movie for what it is, an innocent fluff despite the short running time of 91 minutes. Katherine Heigl is adorable and has a sparkling chemistry with Jason O'Mara. Debbie Reynolds steals every scene she is in. Now this movie is never going to win any Oscars with its plot, which has several holes, a not-so-great villain and a predictable ending. At times the movie feels less like a theatrical release and more like a television pilot, where it probably would have been more successful. I wonder why it cost forty million to make this movie, the studio could have filmed it on a lower budget and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. Despite several flaws, I enjoyed the quirky characters.",One For the Money

When I saw this American preview version with Daniel Craig, I thought this will be fantastic and will be a trilogy I would like to have in my collection.  However, after watching it (even tho it is so close to the book), I can't help but to think why was this even remade?  American movie with English speaking actors trying so hard to speak English with a Swedish accent?  And the girl, no expression whatsoever thru the whole movie.  Noomi knows when to be expressionless and when to express a little.  And the bad guys in the original, you couldn't help but really despise them.  This version, the bad guys were more of jokers than acting like bad guys where you love to hate.  I cried at the end of the original.  This one, I said ""What de Hell?""

1533882,"Once in a while, a movie comes along that's just so magical that there's no way to describe it. Moonrise Kingdom is one such. It comes across as an utterly low-key indie flick, but with boggling star power: Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, and Tilda Swinton. But even at that, the kids take the movie over, as they should.The couple, age twelvish, come across with authenticity that borders on painful. Each is disaffected, each wants more and sees it within reach, and each sees it within the other, somehow. They take off on their doomed trek, together, trusting in each other and not a lot else. And, along the way, they share some of the more awkward moments of young love - with utterly serious solemnity, as kids do when trying to act grown up.The thing is, they do it - at least sort of. They make enemies, and defeat them. They need allies, and make them. And, in the end, they win, sort of. The adult actors rise to the children's level, especially Swinton in the role of Social Services (apparently wearing what she found in a Pan Am stewardess's closet). But, don't worry. Nothing I can say can really be a spoiler. When something, even something very familiar, is done very well, it becomes a new thing. This is done very, very well. Even with its near-total lack of special effects, it's very special indeed.-- wiredweird",N/A
136570,"""Cyborg"" is an entry into Jean-Claude Van Damme's filmography that could not be made a second time. Only the second starring role in Van Damme's career, it was likely only during this desperate part of his Hollywood life that he would have willingly submitted himself to the creative whims of infamous director Albert Pyun. However, in all fairness, this is definitely one of the best features Pyun would ever make, and if nothing else, it's fun seeing the Muscles from Brussels in something as trashy and creatively reckless like this. This isn't one of Van Damme's more lauded pictures, but fans who can find beauty in imperfections ought to be entertained by this.The story: in a dystopian future, a mercenary for hire (Van Damme,Bloodsport) tracks down a ruthless pirate leader (Vincent Klyn,Point Break) attempting to destroy the last hope for humanity.I like to compare ""Cyborg"" here to the stylistically similarNemesis, another action vehicle Pyun directed some three years later. While the latter had better action content and had more fun with the concept of artificial humans, ""Cyborg"" is infinitely better made with stronger production values. Indeed, whereas most of ol' Albert's movies look like they've been shot on abandoned property or out in the wilderness, ""Cyborg"" benefits from sets that had famously been prepared for ""He-Man"" and ""Spider-Man"" films which were never produced. There's a good deal of color to the world, despite its post-apocalyptic state, so it's rarely dull to look at like a lot of the director's stuff. The acting really isn't great, particularly Vincent Klyn's, but there are a couple examples of effective silent acting between Van Damme and Deborah Richter (Promised Land).Again in comparison to ""Nemesis"", ""Cyborg"" has less action but that doesn't mean it's an insufficient amount. Additionally, the fight scenes are nicely varied: karate, knife-fighting, shootouts, and a couple explosions make for a well-rounded spectacle. All of the hand-to-hand scenes could definitely have been shot better and Van Damme is in definite need of more opponents to fight one-on-one, but the choreography is occasionally inventive, like when he performs a jumping reverse roundhouse to slice open a thug's neck with a nail protruding from his boot. Speaking of the need for more one-on-one villains, I was disappointed by how all of the creative-looking henchmen are automatically relegated to bit status: they include Ralf Moeller (Gladiator) and Stefanos Miltsakakis (Maximum Risk) among other weirdoes, but they're all virtual nobodies and crumble before Van Damme's kicks.I wish there could have been more of that cheesy, retro stop-motion you see early in the film and less slow motion, but with Pyun you can't ask for everything. ""Cyborg"" ends up being pretty tit-for-tat - not a must-have for Van Damme devotees, but an interesting excursion if you tire of his more kosher work. Me, I'm glad I finally got to see it, but it definitely doesn't merit a purchase. A rental will do.",N/A

Armie Hammer does a fantastic job of portraying a young farm boy who believes God wants him to preach; along the way he stumbles yet grows while learning how to preach.  One of the finest scenes for me was him preaching to a passing crowd while only one man responds, 'no one wants anything to do with me' and Billy says &#34;God does&#34;, and embraces the black man pouring out his heart.  Then the wonderful scenes of a nervous lovestruck college student hopelessly falling for Ruth, who becomes his one and only the rest of her life.  So many other poignant scenes with Charles Templeton, becoming youngest president of a Bible college, and ending with his famous 1949 Los Angeles Tent Crusade (which both of my parents attended).

Henry Fonda is John Bottomly, the state attorney general's special prosecutor or assistant or -- well, the AG asked him to head up a ""strangler task force"" because four different counties were involved. Still, women were dying and there seemed to be no real clues. The women of the Boston metropolitan area were scared out of their wits, although somehow enough opened their doors to the strangler. Why? We eventually find out, but the whole thing gets more mysterious all the time. The first three (or was it four?) victims were elderly women who lived alone. Then a young black woman who had roommates, then the rest were young white women. But the MO was consistent, and it was clear they were all killed by the same person. In fact, the police had some details they did not share with the press, as is common with such cases, that tied the cases together.As most people know, Albert Desalvo, played by Tony Curtis, was eventually arrested on a simple breaking and entering. But he had a human bite on his hand just like the only woman who survived his assault remembered giving him. The cops checked his record, and specifically checked that he had no alibi for any of the dates and times of the eleven murders or the attack on the one living victim.Turns out he was completely psycho -- as the movie demonstrates effectively -- and was locked up in a mental hospital. He was never brought to trial, but he did effectively confess. Why do I say ""effectively""? See the movie. It's a very tense drama about a very tense time in Boston's history.",N/A

And if you're looking for anything even remotely close to the quality of ""Madmen,"" sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this show is at Titanic level depths beneath the quality of ""Madmen.""  First problem, the writing of Swingtown was terrible.  Evidently none of the writers grew up in the 70s, because there was virtually zero attempt to make the characters speak like they're actually in the 70s.  The 70s were exploding with words, phrases and slang unique to the 70s but you'll find hardly any ""70s-speak"" on this show.  What's worse, the writers use words in ways they were not used back in the 70s, such as the dismissive form of ""whatever"" and the buddy/pal form of ""dude.""  Those uses of ""whatever"" and ""dude"" didn't start until the mid 80s.  So sloppy lazy writing that fails to immerse you in the time period.  Set design is also weak, with far too many sets and locales looking too ""stage-y"" and fake.  And if you look closely in some scenes in which characters are driving around in a car, you can see 2000-era sports cars and SUVs driving past in the background.  I mean that's so bad that it's like Ed Woods levels of incompetance.  Stories?  Forgettable.  Acting?  Forgettable.  Editing?  Forgettable.  Music/Soundtrack?  So-so.

But Plankton who has been receiving nothing but coal, comes up with a plan to taint fruit cake with jerktonium and making everyone bad so their Christmas is ruined.But when Plankton tries the tainted fruit cake on SpongeBob, it doesn't work.  So, Plankton figures his invention is not working and thus gives the Jerktonium maker to SpongeBob, who decides to give everyone in Bikini Bottom some of Plankton's delicious fruit cake.But when everyone starts acting like a jerk after eating the tainted fruitcake, what happens when Santa comes to Bikini Bottom?  Will they get presents or a lump of coal?What is SpongeBob SquarePants?For over a decade, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" has become such a tremendous hit for Nickelodeon and an animated series that many children have grown up with. A popular franchise which includes video games, the character featured on a variety of food products, toys, health-related items and more. Needless to say, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"", although not a series shown on broadcast television, has managed to become a character that is part of American pop culture and still shows no signs of waning, especially with a new group of young viewers every year.Created by Stephen Hillenburg in 1999, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" is an animated series about a group of characters that live in the underwater city known as ""Bikini Bottom"".The main character of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" are:SpongeBob SquarePants - A energetic and naive sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea with his pet snail Gary and works as a cook for The Krusty Krab.

This is the first ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" episode featured in stop-motion, so this is the first episode not animated and the characters are presented via in foam or fabric.  Picture quality is good for DVD and the stop motion, especially the movement of the characters was excellent, especially planning the mouth movements to the dialogue.  Lighting and overall look of Bikini Bottom was also well-done!Dialogue is in 5.1 Dolby Digital stereo, front channel driven, dialogue and music is clear and understandable.SPECIAL FEATURES:""SpongeBob SquarePants: It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"" comes with the following special features:Behind-the-Scenes Feature - (7:16) The making of ""It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"".

For the past five years, he has been a big fan of the animated series and has wanted everything that the character is featured on, may it be yogurt to toothpaste, he is a SpongeBob maniac and both us were pretty excited to see this Christmas episode and see how the characters look via stop-motion.The crew did a wonderful job in creating the world of Bikini Bottom but also creating the characters for stop-motion.  The movements resembled the series and while created in stop-motion, the series felt natural and of course maintained the hilarious and crazy aspect of the the animated series via stop-motion.And with the theme being Christmas-related, I have no doubt that children and the entire family will enjoy ""SpongeBob SquarePants: It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"".  For kids, they will enjoy the crazy transformation of the characters as they eat the tainted fruit cake, while parents who grew up watching the classic stop-motion animated Christmas specials as a child, will be thrilled to see this tradition continue with this special Christmas episode of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"".While the DVD is short, I did wish there were extra episodes included especially past ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" Christmas episodes.  But on its own, if you are a parent and your children love ""SpongeBob SquarePants"", this DVD will no doubt keep them entertained during the holidays!  Recommended!",SpongeBob SquarePants: It's A SpongeBob Christmas!
1509930,"This is a spectacular film; the acting is extremely subtle and emotionally driven, the music is spot on perfect (you'll be buying the soundtrack right afterward as I did) and the mood is so super-cool you'll want to live in those remarkable moments beat for beat within the film.First, I concede that the marketing for this film may have attempted to sell the movie for something different than what it is, but that is hardly Nicholas Winding Refn's (Director) fault and the a fore mentioned fact should not cause you to fail to enjoy what can most closely be described as an art-house actioner from a brilliant auteur. Refn is always aware of the genre his film may be compared to and deliberately severs the connection between the two in his most poignant  scenes. Where one style would speed things up and force edit cuts on you every few seconds, Refn slows things down and lets you feel the pulse of each character, he lets you study them before the inevitable brutality commences. For example...*Possible Spoilers Below...you'll notice the film features the bloodiest and most brutal scenes at the beginning and towards the middle, and then consciously removes the gore in favor of allowing the audience to soak in the character during the event, rather than the shock value of the event itself; this style emerges slowly and then reaches its peak in the finale. I believe this was deliberate and I feel it was very effective in giving this film its own tone, its own formula.Don't expect what you've been programmed to expect; this is not a remake, sequel, rehash of old formulas, this is something new so study and try to enjoy it for what it is. I do not feel this film is made for everyone, but I do feel that a lot of viewers aren't judging it for what it is, merely how different it may be from what they were expecting. I try to enter a film with a blank slate as much as I can, don't listen to promotions, don't watch too many trailers, just go and experience the film for what it is; Drive is definitely one of those times where you will benefit from pushing PLAY, open your eyes and ears and experience what the director intended...then discuss.",N/A
1444980,"Other reviewers have mentioned the 'grain' was added for theatricality, but it is just annoying. Especially when the Blu-Ray costs more. So just stick to the DVD version instead and save some money.And in other news, I read that some folks compare this to Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell and that is really not accurate. I could see it being closer to Ghost in the Shell than Blade Runner. But I am a huge fan of both films and this falls short of those on nearly every account. Plus I watch a ton of sci-fi and dystopian anime, even series not widely available in the states, and this is merely passable compared to much.The series seems to start off good enough, but then it fizzles out and doesn't really seem to recapture any steam. The characters seem to all be very flat archetypes without any real development, or any real draw for the viewer. Plus the 14 year old looking heroine is naked a lot. Not so much of a problem in Ghost in the Shell with the obviously adult Motoko, but in this I felt uncomfortable, like a peeping pedophile.There are a lot of adult themes but often it seems they are included just to 'grow up' the series. It's not worth watching if you are into deep and complex stories. I would say to check out the film and series for Ghost in the Shell if you haven't. Also Darker than Black is a good series with a dark spin. And there is always Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. Even No.6 was better and I wasn't too keen on that series either (it was too short and the plot didn't have enough time to develop).There are better series out there, so just be aware before you buy this. Perhaps checking it out first on Netflix would be preferable. I was able to get the Blu-Ray from my local library so luckily I didn't plop $30 on this. And please don't hate me for this review, I would probably give it 3 stars except that the Blu-Ray version is pretty pointless with the grainy resolution (which I'm not sure was intentional - even the black background on the opening credits is horribly grainy).And also of note: this was based on a novel (which is available at my library) so I am thinking the novel might be much better than the anime. I'll keep everyone posted.",Mardock Scramble: The First Compression
1388177,"BETWEEN TWO WORLDS was adapted by Daniel Fuchs, the writer ofCRISS CROSS(1949),PANIC IN THE STREETS(1950) andSTORM WARNING(1951). Fuchs won an Oscar for scriptingLOVE ME OR LEAVE ME(1955), the biopic of Ruth Etting that starred Doris Day and Jimmy Cagney..None-too-subtle bashing of capitalism, as we see in this movie, was popular during WWII and the early post-war years but there was soon a response: the HUAC investigations of Hollywood and a dogged search for ""fellow travelers."" John Garfield was one of those caught in this trap. Perhaps the stress of being a suspected ""Red"" hastened the coronary that claimed him at a too-young age.Occasional over-melodramatic touches in ""Between Two Worlds"" don't detract much from an interesting supernatural fantasy involving a group of dead folks sailing on a fogbound sea toward their fates. To my mind, this is Garfield's best film work. His unemployed reporter Tom Prior is flippant and word-playful (in a morose sort of way). Tom can't wait to shock everyone with the news that they are all dead, and he uses a pistol to demonstrate it.Miss Emerson plays a caricature: the cynical ""fallen"" woman who tries cleaning up her act before she's judged. Henreid and Parker, as the disabled pianist and his devoted wife, bear the lion's share of this picture's pathos, but Miss Allgood gets a chance to turn on our waterworks after she's been declared worthy of a little seaside cottage with a white picket fence. We also sympathize with the unlucky merchant marine (Tobias) who will never see his newborn son.Elsom and Emery are a too-long married couple. He's a good egg who for years has quietly tolerated his wife's endless nagging. King is  Reverend Duke, a shy cleric who's never been beyond his own parish. Duke thinks he's off on an adventure to America, but he's really just cruising toward Judgment Day. The ship's steward, Scrubby (Gwenn), is caught in limbo by his own doings. He's made this voyage to nowhere countless thousands of times.Greenstreet's Thompson the Examiner is a no-nonsense type. As an example, he immediately sends to hell the film's most repugnant character, an arrogant industrialist named Lingley (Coulouris), after the man demands his trial NOW. Greenstreet's icy response: ""You've already HAD your trial"" and the befuddled multi-millionaire is led away, defeated, deflated and finally silent.This film is based on Sutton Vane's stageplay, ""Outward Bound.""

His teacher Dennis Hopper, tells him that the only way he can pass, is to turn in a science project, that isn't in anyway connected to cars.

1335837,"Throughout this remarkable film -- along with exquisite natural dioramas -- I subliminally focused on its star turn of Water.  Whether as first request of female pilgrim to no-mans-land sanctuary (a drink of water) or sacred and isolated grotto, this pristine fluid proffered solace for healing the feminine from male abuse.Slaking thirst, purifying, submerging, containing, nurturing, perhaps water's role since the beginning of time -- even in the cultural stories we tell ourselves. (For example, remembering Mary Magdalene's washing the feet of Jesus)And may explain why women almost universally will chose a bathtub over a shower - when given the option.The images and cinematography within ""Woman without Men"" -- by two talented and courageous Iranian women -- spring from and speak to (my) intuition, so ineffable. Best let them talk to yours -- rather than attempt to pin down the numinous with words.I highly recommend this topical film for both men and women, as we currently ratchet up our demonizing of Iran -- and justifications for disasterous sanctions (and perhaps war) -- against this hoary, precious poetic culture~",N/A

18609,"During the last two weeks, I went to see Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Elite Squad: The Enemy Within. Both received excellent reviews, but not from me. Tinker, Tailor because it was so slow and Elite Squad because it was so fast. I walked out of Elite Squad and wished I had walked out of Tinker, Tailor but I fell into a coma. What both films have in common is their inability to tell a story, which has to be the essence of film making. The directors of these films, Tomas Alfredson and Jose Padilha, would do well to view the DVD of The Professionals and learn from a pro, Richard Brooks. 1966 was a busy year for me so I missed The Professionals in its theatrical release. Too bad. Last week, a friend gave it to me and what a treat! This is a great, GREAT western from a masterful director, Richard Brooks, who could direct in just about any genre (Elmer Gantry, Blackboard Jungle, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof). In The Professionals, Brooks gives us a well-constructed, exciting, and often humorous screenplay (by Brooks himself), superb cinematography, beautiful locations, and a cast that any director would die for: Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Woody Strode, Claudia Cardinale, Ralph Bellamy, and Jack Palance. The set-up for the story takes five minutes, and then off it goes. It never bored me, not for a second. The dramatic tension is sustained throughout. The actors are terrific, even Marvin, who apparently was drunk during most of the shooting. Lancaster's role is unusual in that he plays the off-beat character instead of the usual lead. He is in top form, especially showing us that he was a gifted comedian in addition to his intensity, charisma, and physical agility. Palance is great as a Pancho Villa-type Mexican revolutionary/bandit and Claudia Cardinale offers surprisingly good acting in addition to some of the sexiest movie shots I've ever seen. Each of the characters has his/her own fascinating qualities, which are offered up by Brooks in tantalizing tidbits. The story itself has some unusual twists so that it is more than simply a shoot-em-up. I loved it.",N/A

1604185,"""The Oranges"" (2012 release; 90 min.) brings the story of two married couples living across the street from each other. There is Terry and Cathy Ostroff (played by Oliver Platt and Allison Janney). Terry and Cathy are best friends with David and Paige Walling (played by Hugh Laurie and Catherine Keener), whose marriage is not going well and whose twenty-something yr. old daughter Vanessa still lives with them. This is in sharp contrast with Terry and Cathy's daughter (and Vanessa's childhood friend) Nina (played by Leighton Meester), who is living ""la vida loca"" in San Francisco. Things go unexpectedly sour for Nina who, tails between her legs, moves in with her parents. The two families are enjoying their time together, until Nina and David develop a crush on each other (despite their significant age difference). At that point we are about one-third into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would simply ruin your viewing experience. But as you can well imagine, all kinds of crazy situations develop from there, some of them funny, others bittersweet, and yet other moments outright sad.Several comments: Hugh Laurie (yes, he of the ""House"" TV series) shows again with this performance how versatile he really is. (Remember a year ago he released an album ""Let Them Talk"", which was critically well-received.) I'm sure it had to be a relief for Laurie to be playing a character so vastly different from ""House"". However, Catherine Keener and Oliver Platt also bring choice performances. It's difficult to assess Leighton Meester, as it is hard to make that leap of faith to see what she sees in David, who is twice her age. Also it is a bit strange that the movie was released in early October (when I saw it at the Landmark E Street Theatre in Washington), as the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays play a significant role in the movie.All that aside, the bottom line is that this movie is more than just a 'romantic comedy', as the movie brings home some poignant moments. I found myself enjoying this movie a lot more than I had expected. If you are in the mood for one of those ""little indie movies that could"", ""The Oranges"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",N/A

1404128,"All of the ""Final Destination"" movies pretty much blend into one big blob of killing beautiful young people in creative ways.  I would offer that FD 5 sticks to the same formula and does it well.  Twenty or so office workers are headed to an off-site retreat when they become stuck on a large bridge under repair.  Suddenly high winds cause a series of events (always fun to watch) that begin to destroy the bridge.Minutes earlier one of the young workers (Nicholas D'Agosto) has a vision of what will happen.  Like the previous movies, he's not sure what he's seeing but he knows that he must get others off the bus and the bridge.  Six or seven do (sorry I lost count) and manage to reach safety.  As in earlier episodes ""Death"" is not happy so begins to pick the survivors off one by one.  There really is no other plot.  There is some young romantic angst between Sam (D'Agosto) and his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell, ""Frozen"", & TV's ""The Walking Dead"") but it isn't important.  For those who like this franchise in general, you shouldn't be disappointed.Director Steven Quayle and his writing and visual effects team are highly creative in coming up with unusual ways to die.  FD 5 isn't really scary but there is no question tension is built as we try to guess things like when the gymnast is going to step on the metal screw on the balance beam.  I'm not sure when this series will end but the surprise at the end suggests this isn't the last of the films and not in the way you might think.The Blu ray transfer is crisp and clear in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.

The first part is now available through 5/22 on the PBS website.I also watched all 3 short extra feature documentaries.This is a wonderful film, however it should be noted that there are several fairly graphic war scenes and several scenes with sexuality.The three short documentary featurettes are also worth watching.  One addresses the love story, one addresses the war story and the third featurette discusses the behind the scenes filming.  The movie was filmed in part in Budapest, Hungary.  The actors, director, producer and costume designer all speak warmly and intensely of their involvement in the production.This film is a not-to-be-missed Masterpiece theatre two-part series.  If you have read the book, you will find some differences.  I won't go into detail, since I have not read the book as of yet (I have skimmed through it), but one major difference is that the 1970's part of the novel is not included in the film.  That is probably no great loss, since many readers felt that this part of the book was not necessary.Clemence Poesy (Isabelle Azaire) is stunning and Eddie Redmayne (Stephen) is also captivating.  The juxtaposition of a love story and the historically realistic gut-wrenching story of the loyalty and comraderie among soldiers in the tunnels of France in WWI makes for a very solid plot.The second half of this series will be presented on many PBS Stations on Sunday evening, April 29th.

1417132,"This is a pretty solid if not fairly predictably uplifting tale of a recently-widowed writer taking a 180 degree turn and buying a zoo. Based on the true story of Benjamin Mee, an English writer who bought an actual zoo in Southwest England, the script pulls all the right punches for delivering an entertaining family drama that has a little something for everyone.From the adorably cute daughter to the grumpy teenage son and the Dad who needs to move on from Mom's death, the script almost writes itself with character arcs all revolving around the family moving to the country side and living with the animals. But it's very well done - an excellent cast holds it together and the dialog is believable enough to keep the audience engaged and routing for the zoo's success. My only question was why the zoo was moved from its real life location in England to a fictional rural area outside Los Angeles - some of the quirky zookeeper characters would probably have worked more effectively if it had stayed in the UK.I've read some comments on both here and IMDB that the profanity is too much much for a family film - personally I didn't think there was anything that was not family oriented but then again I don't have kids! Though there is also a revealing fact about the Easter bunny that you may not want your children to know. Overall, it was much more entertaining than I expected and definitely a little different.",N/A

Instead of being disturbed AT ALL, it's more like ""oh well"" and business as usual.  Almost every scene has comparable and similar failings.  Other main players are Dawn Ann Billings, Kristen Howe, and Kimberly Horner,  among others, and sad thing is some of these people can act at least moderately well.  The story line has potential, but the script failed period.  Too bad, too sad.

1447338,"Some of ABC's best ratings of 2011 came in a surprise seasonal package. Its premise revolved around something most shows haven't tackled but viewers everywhere are enthralled with, and finally, it has made its way into my living room.Once upon a time is where each story begins... but not every ending is happily ever after. Some cannot be altered by the perfect fit of a glass slipper or true love's kiss. Sometimes, the memories are stripped away leaving everyone who deserves a happy end lost to everyone they once loved. Every story has a beginning and Emma's is one bad memory after another. Abandoned as an infant by the side of the road, Emma (Jennifer Morrison) grew up in the foster care system never feeling loved or wanted. In the twenty plus years since then, she has learned to let no one in and relied solely on herself. On her 28th birthday, Emma is doing what she does best, catching the bad guys. She boasts two specials skills, one is being able to tell when someone is lying and the other is finding people. Today she is using the latter skill in her job as a bounty hunter while young Henry Mills (Jared Gilmore) has finally found Emma - his mother. Ten years ago Emma gave up a child for adoption, a son who landed in the sleepy town of Storybrooke and the son of Mayor Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla). Emma's trip to return Henry to his mother baffles her almost as much as the tale Henry spins.Henry's story is one that only fairy-tales are made of; he claims that every person living in Storybrooke is really one from the book of fairy tales his teacher Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) gave him. None of them know who they are or where they came from and are being held captive by a spell created by the evil queen, Regina. Emma's destiny is to break the curse as the daughter of Snow White - whom Henry claims is his teacher, Mary Margaret, and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas). The fate of everyone rests on Emma's shoulders but first she must come up against not only Regina but also her cohorts... and what is the mysterious Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) about?Already home to my favorite (or one of them - depends on what day of the week you ask me) shows, Castle, ABC was 2-for-2 in the 2011 television season when it came to finding new shows to be entertained by. The only thing overruling viewer's curiosity about this delight of a show is the credibility of some characters - we are constantly on our guard with each one though through it all that speaks of a fabulous cast, which this show has. Every actor puts his or her best into their roles and each evil look or kind gesture is always made clear through their expressions of acting because, well... they are that good. Also included in the recurring cast list is Meghan Ory, Raphael Sbarge, Anastasia Griffith ('Royal Pains'), David Anders, Emilie de Ravin, Jessy Schram and Eion Bailey ('Covert Affairs') as a mysterious stranger in addition to a host of others. What is perhaps so great about these characters (and they are fabulous!) is that it is left up to us to find out who they are. Unlike most shows, in `Once,' writer's don't hand out information readily - we are instead asked to uncover the good, and the bad of each person.For a show that I expected to love (so, I am a lover of sappy stories - you aren't just now figuring that out, are ya'!?) I was shocked that I was more enamored with the ""real world"" than the fairy-tale. Though pretty to look at, from a scenic perspective, none of the costumes or make-up appeals to our vision of authentic to the fairy-tale world. Similarly save for the outdoor scenes, the settings are modern and really, too ""big."" Those transitions between fairy-tale and real world are usually well timed but for a girl who was expecting to find the fantasy elements of the show more interesting, I was surprised at how caught up in the modern counterparts I was. Just as I was hooked, the show backspaced to storybook land which sometimes upset the intensity of a scene but is after all, the best way to keep suspense - and the viewer, on top of things.Regardless of petty complaints, this show was very whimsical in its own fashion. It's really quite clever in the ways it introduces and compacts so many fairy-tales into one story and world. No matter what you may think of it, your initial perspective of it may be turned upside down. It strengthens the further it investigates each character and it features every genre you could possible want; mystery, drama, comedy, romance, fantasy, all in a package that effortlessly cumulates together forming a beautiful if not sometimes transparent story. If there was only one thing I would wish television did different, it'd be the song-and-dance it puts its lovers - or would-be lovers through. I ""get"" the need for complications and incentive but this particular scenario is running amuck with such stories so please give Snow/Mary Margaret and Charming/David more than a tragedy and stolen glances. Believe me, I will still watch, as would the hundreds of fans. The more happiness, characters are given even in strife, the happier fans will be. Or maybe I am just speaking for myself but... from experience, I seriously doubt it. The good guys need some victories as happily ever after can never be snatched from beloved characters and the sooner writer's realize that, the better off they will be.

1524165,"This review covers the whole series (Part I and II) and contains no spoilers.- Introduction -These 24 episodes are a prelude. A prologue. This anime is an adaptation of the light novel series. It is an excellent series nevertheless, in anime or light novel format.Unfortunately the light novels which cover the story after these 24 episodes, as of now, remain largely untranslated. The story gets so juicy after 24 episodes. But. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginning.Ryner Lute and his friend Sion go to a military school for the poor and the orphaned. They train for war as tools for the nobels. The setting is much like Europe, multiple nations, multiple war fronts, and tension between all kingdoms/nations.The school is sent out on a mission. I won't say how it ends, for it would be a spoiler but it's not too interesting. In fact, it is rather predictable. The anxiety and constant fear of the red headed main female character gives it away.Ryner is arrested after the battle and is tortured for being an Alpha Stigma, a powerful magician-berserker. Sion is chosen to be the hero of the battle and the red headed female is released in exchange for Ryner's freedom. (The red headed female is such a minor character I can't recall her name.)Ryner spends years writing a thesis in regard to legendary relics of power. Sion, now king, discovers this thesis and spares Ryner from the death penalty (given automatically to Alpha Stigmas).From here Ryner meets Ferris, a bishoujo that is a demon with the sword -- and dango consumption.I think that's enough summarizing. Let's get into why this anime is so good.- Characters -Ryner and Ferris both have lazy and laid back personalities. Whereas Sion has a workaholic drive and endless ambition. This foil creates a fun and comedic atmosphere. Ryner and Ferris slack and Sion gets on their case for being such slackers. All three of these main characters change subtly throughout the anime, then at the end you can see the accumulation of all the subtle changes. It's drastic. They've changed. And it changes the relationship dynamic. Bonds are broken and bonds grow closer.In short, the characters are fun and memorable.- Plot -You won't be disappointed with the plot. There are political elements (corruption, struggles for the throne, crises, alliances), constant war (nations fighting against one another, major powers rising, weaponry), and how the characters play into these worldly events. The characters featured in this anime are major power players. The world moves around them in this anime. They are the strongest and they are the most powerful. The most powerful change the world.- Packaging -The packaging for this anime is rather nice. Individual slots for each disk, a decent box, and a small tarot card bonus for each Part. The special edition for Part I includes a red box inside with some neat character art, but both Part I and II have lackluster art on the outer boxes. Part I's special edition box's backside is akin to the DVD covers. The DVD covers feature main characters and also decorate the inside. They're alright. At least consideration was taken into decorating both the inside and outside of the DVD case (whoops, I forgot, I meant Blu-ray case). The DVD's/Blu-Rays are nothing special. Blue themed disks for Blu-ray, red for the DVD's. The art on both is just an Alpha Stigma symbol. Not exciting but it works.Can you tell by now? I'm sure you looked at the product picture and could figure it out. Part I and II are a combination of Blu-rays and DVD's.  So you get to watch the whole series in either Blu-ray or DVD quality. Yippie. It's a nice bonus.- Quality -I won't review the quality aspect of this release. I don't have time anymore to watch the whole series again (for the third time) but I can tell you that it should be good. Come on. It's Blu-ray.- Thanks for Reading -I hope you found my review helpful. I really enjoyed this series and therefore put in my time for a detailed review.",The Legend of the Legendary Heroes: Part 1

1461602,"I'm not going to BORE you to death with a long winded, half hour ""This movie stinks"" comment like a couple one and two-star people did. They sure wrote a lot for people who hated the movie. And they apparently weren't as bored with the movie as they claimed either... I noticed they recalled almost every scene and every aspect of the film. I mean, come on... if it was that bad, I would not have stayed at the theater to be tortured any longer.The truth is that the film certainly isn't the same type of movie as many others that either Hanks or Roberts has starred in. However, it does take somewhat of an interesting turn off the beaten path for both actors as well as George Takei (Mr. Sulu of Star Trek fame) who proves in this film that he can still play a serious roll when confronted with the opportunity. The actors in this movie portray what I see as more realistic everyday people more like ourselves. Julia Roberts portrays a common middle-aged college teacher fresh off a crappy marriage... I repeat... 'COMMON'. She's not a famous star reporter or the subject of a hooker's dream... a rich guy sweeps her off her feet. Tom Hanks portrays a middle-age man who has lost his job, and eventually his home, and needs to go back to school in an attempt to improve his future. Again, just a fairly common guy... served a hitch in the Navy and has a knack for cooking... not some lone survivor stranded on a uninhabited island or a guy that falls in love with a mermaid.This is a lighthearted DRAMA, not a thriller, science fiction or fantasy movie. And if I'm gonna watch a drama, there's no better actors to fill the bill than Hanks and Roberts in my opinion.",Larry Crowne

1598917,"HOOK, LINE & SINKER has a terrible reputation.  Some critics such as Leonard Maltin in his MOVIE GUIDE call the film a bomb.  I don't agree.  While it's not prime Jerry it's certainly better, imo, than some of his other late 60's titles such as WAY WAY OUT! & DON'T RAISE THE BRIDGE, LOWER THE RIVER.  Like those other Lewis films this is not a film directed by Lewis himself, but rather by old Hollywood hand George Marshall, whose career went back to the silent days, and whose final feature film this would be.There is a good plot in this film.  Lewis' doctor (Peter Lawford) tells Jerry that he has a heart condition and limited time left, his wife (the beautiful Anne Francis) tells him he should make the most of the time that is left and enjoy his final days doing what he loves--fishing--in exotic locales using only the best equipment on chartered boats, etc.  It will cost a fortune--of course Lewis doesn't have that kind of money, but his wife tells him to put it all on credit cards and not worry about the bills--his insurance will pay for it when he croaks.  The trouble is that it's all a set-up and Lewis is not dying and the doctor and wife are in cahoots.There are some good sight gags in the film--a wild dance by a drunken Jerry and an amusing scene where he breaks into a morgue by coming thru a window and attempting to light a candle.  That is all vintage stuff, but for a lot of the picture it's a  black comedy which Lewis plays fairly straight and allows others to shine--such as the always terrific Kathleen Freeman playing baby sitter to Lewis and Francis's children.This film (released by Columbia) was released 20 years after the first Jerry Lewis film, MY FRIEND IRMA.  For 15 of those 20 years, Lewis was a top box office star both with his partner Dean Martin and individually from 1957-1964 in a string of classic comedies most directed by Lewis and his mentor, Frank Tashlin.  After 1964, the quality of Lewis's films fell off and slowly so did his box office potency.  After HOOK LINE & SINKER, Lewis would complete only two more films--before taking a long sabbatical from pictures. Part of the falling off of his popularity is that after 1964, as Lewis was close to turning 40, he decided he was too old to play 'The Kid' and made an attempt to mature his screen image.  Sometimes it worked (I love BOEING BOEING) and sometimes it fell flat.  HOOK LINE & SINKER, I think, falls somewhere in the middle.",N/A
24953,"Wow! What an incredible transfer! I expect nothing but the best from Criterion and they rarely let me down, but this time they outdid even themselves. I cannot imagine this movie looking crisper when it was first released some 70 years ago. It also has a great set of extras, including the full sequel to the movie (which is a fun little film, for what it is, despite being Hitchcock-less).And the movie? It's still the same great Hitchcock classic you know and love. Widely considered his best film from his film-making days in Europe, Lady Vanishes combines a creepy aura of suspense, dread, conspiracy and paranoia with some clever and impeccably timed comedy. Hitch always added humor to even his most horrific films, but I don't think he ever quite achieved the &#34;peanut butter in my chocolate&#34; levels of humor and horror that he did in Lady Vanishes (The Trouble With Harry, despite being an inferior film, most likely comes closest).This is a fun movie given a second life thanks to a stunning video restoration and audio clean up that removes all noticeable hiss, snaps, crackles and pops (at least the ones that weren't meant to be there in the first place). Placing The Lady Vanishes on your shelf will do your collection proud -- if only there weren't so many great extras that all but guarantee it will spend as much time in your blu-ray player as it does in your blu-ray collection.NOTE: I just looked through my Criterion blus and the only other transfer that has impressed as much belongs to A Night to Remember.

1035190,"[NOTE:  This review was written before President Obama won in 2008.]Make no mistake: this is a very, very scary movie. It is a story of child abuse, in my opinion, and the extent to which the State of Missouri is involved is most unsettling, along with everything else.It is also a movie about the American Jihad: the Holy War being waged in the political arena by the conservative right of the Republican party and the evangelistic Christians who have large enough numbers to sway any election.The story centers around a camp run by an evangelical teacher of children. This so greatly resembled some of the pictures in ""Obsession"" [about Muslim children] that I literally got cold chills. For one week these kids are indoctrinated, brainwashed, propagandized to become Christian Soldiers, proselytizers for the fundamentalist faith, and quite specifically for the anti-abortion movement and for creationism, prayer and Bible reading in the public schools. They are practically blackmailed into making a promise to fight against abortion rights, they put on camouflage face paint and dance with sticks that are clapped together to a warrior's song. They are taught to repent so intensely that one dear little girl (the same one in the photo above) got so red in the face with hysterical crying I was afraid she would pass out. And what do they repent? Being afraid to tell their school friends about Jesus, to proselytize in their school classrooms.The movie includes a radio talk show host who offers a critical view of the situation, but still is a Christian, and in the end seems willing to give up to the fundies. It includes cuts from a televangelist in Colorado Springs who said some outrageous things, and then added ""If you use that, I will sue you."" I think he's the same one who was more recently arrested for buying drugs from a male prostitute, or something like that. The name starts with an ""F"" and no, I don't want to go back and watch it in order to get his name. He freaked me out.It's a very scary movie indeed, especially when you see this televangelist boldly saying that the fundamentalists (whom he calls ""evangelicals"") can sway any election. George Bush and his cronies and appointees know it, and we had better speak up about the separation of church and state before it is too late, if it isn't already. At the camp, the kids were offered a life-sized cardboard cut-out of President Bush with two kids holding a large American flag behind him, and told to pray for him, and to chant ""One nation under God"" over and over.I've joined Americans United for Separation of Church and State, but I think I need to do more. I'm preparing a presentation for the Ethical Society forum, and expect to give it the Sunday closest to Halloween, to emphasize the spooky, scary aspects of this Holy Terror.It won't make you feel good (unless you're a fundamentalist yourself), but it is an important movie.",Jesus Camp

507326,"that this was Judy Garland's finest hour in films.  My five star rating comes from seeing this film in a Boston theatre in the mid 1980's.  1984, I think.  It was a stunning event. You simply had, and have, to see it on the big screen.So now I have this disc thing.  It IS her finest hour.  Or hours.  It's all here. It's a long film, but it was intended to be so.  This was no run of the musical.  This was and is the real deal. The GWTW of movie musicals.Prissy Noel Coward (though I'm fond of his writings) loved the film but not the ""Born In A Trunk"" sequence.  I don't agree with him.  He's wrong.  My gripe is the ""It's A New World"" number sung in a cheap motel room.  Garland should have been given a better number, I think.  But who cares what I think.  I wasn't there and had no input on the production.  I wasn't even born then.I saw this film, years earlier, in my parents' basement on a black and white Zenith TV.  The dressing room sequence had been cut out, as well as ""Lose That Long Face"".  I wondered why she was there with spots on her face for 5 seconds and then disappeared.  Now I know.  Her dressing room breakdown scene raises the hair on my neck and goosebumps all over me.  Her character is so naked and Judy is so sublime.  Thrilling.  Brilliant acting.Her voice is dark and needy and wonderful.  Gone forever is the MGM songbird.  Here, forever, is the adult Garland in a role that gives her everything, and she takes everything and throws it back at you.  This really isn't acting.  It's acting at it's most sublime level.

971078,"Few words about the two movie adaptations of Tennessee's brilliant novella.The first one is the 1961 film with Vivien Leigh, Warren Beatty and Lotte Lenya, directed by Jos&eacute; Quintero and with screenplay by Gavin Lambert. The second is the 2003 made-for-television production starring Helen Mirren, Olivier Martinez and Anne Bancroft , directed by Robert Allan Ackerman and with screenplay by Martin Sherman. Neither movie does full justice to the literary original. But the former is much closer than the latter.The 1961 movie is visually rather badly dated. Most of it was shot in studio and, despite the lavish production, it's difficult to be taken in that it's Rome. But the screenplay is a fine adaptation, using most of the best lines in the novella, and Quintero is an excellent director (amazingly, this was his debut on the screen, having previously directed only on the stage). Of course any hints about Meg's lesbian inclinations or Paolo's bisexuality (one of his previous clients was a Baron) are eliminated completely, but neither are they central to the work. Few other ""straight"" sexual references are toned down but the character of the book is on the whole preserved.(So many people so wrongly think that Tennessee was concerned in his works with exploration of homosexuality, repressed or not. Not at all. It is confused sexuality that he finds most fascinating. And the confusion refers to both the direction and the intensity. But that's another story.)Although ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" remains my absolutely first choice, it is not hard to see why Tennessee Williams called this version of ""The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone"" ""a poem"" and his personal favourite of all movies based on his works.Vivien Leigh is splendid, conveying Karen's vulnerability, yet also her dignity, with marvellous restraint. Warren Beatty never was much of an actor, but in his twenties he looks totally gorgeous and that's the most important thing for the part; still, he puts on a passable Italian accent and brings off Paolo's childish ingenuity rather convincingly. Lotte Lenya is a very sneaky Contessa, apparently from German descent as her chilling ""Wunderbar"" in the end suggests.Unfortunately the chemistry between Warren and Vivien doesn't always work. That's the basic defect of the movie once you get past the artificiality of the studio sets and Vivien's slightly horrible wig. Otherwise this is a poignant film, cleverly directed and beautifully acted.The 2003 movie is visually spectacular. That's the best I can say about it. In every other aspect it is significantly inferior to the earlier one. The screenplay is much less successful, extending unnecessarily the part until the death of Karen's husband and omitting more from the original than the older version. There is a great deal of nudity and numerous sex scenes (the vigorous one in the car was especially glorious), but this doesn't prevent the movie from being a total disappointment. After that steamy adventure in the car comes the first of only two original additions in the screenplay worth mentioning:Karen: ""Do you love me?""Paolo: ""I am hungry.""The universal fame of Helen Mirren is one of the great mysteries of modern times. She does a decent job here, and she looks pleasantly haggard (Vivien was accused of being too beautiful for the part), but her performance is nothing to rave about. If Warren Beatty never was much of an actor, Olivier Martinez is no actor at all; and if the chemistry between Vivien and Warren was insufficient, the one between Helen and Olivier is completely missing. Apparently the producers and the screenwriter thought that when they load the movie with nudity and sex, the chemistry would somehow materialize. Nope, doesn't work that way. Most of the scenes with Karen and Paolo are pathetic.After the visual side, the best in this movie are the supporting roles. Anne Bancroft is a scary Contessa that's not easily forgettable. Roger Allam plays Christopher, a dramatist who takes the role of Meg from the novella. The remarkable thing about this character is that he was clearly intended as a portrait of Tennessee Williams. The moustache, the voice, the laugh, the body language: everything is carefully imitated. It's a very clever touch, brilliantly executed. To him belongs the second memorable original line in the screenplay:""Beautiful boys are medicinal. Like penicillin, they should be taken twice a day until the course is finished, after which you should in theory recover.""Karen Stone never fully recovered, though.",N/A

I got ahold of the limited edition DVD by the skin of my teeth. Amazon had already sold out of it within 3 weeks of it's release. Luckily, Best Buy got a hold of a copy for me. I will echo the others here, it is absurd and outrageous to not have a general release of this film. There are plenty of people wanting to see it. I really cannot even imagine what Disney is thinking. I do have a tip for those who have not seen this yet. At the time Disney was making this film, Hammer Films was making their own version. Disney sued and won, so some things in the Hammer version had to be changed, most notably the Scarecrow becomes a minor character but I actually am one of handful who prefer the Hammer version. It is called ""Night Creatures"" and readily available on a Hammer box set on Amazon. It is something to watch while waiting for Disney to act.

1469259,"I really enjoyed this lighthearted action movie.It's a fanciful contemporary spin on the myth of how the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, long after having dethroned and permanently immobilized their titanic father Cronos, have become less powerful due to the declining devotions of the people. ""Not without reason"" says Perseus sarcastically when he's visited by Zeus with this complaint.  Now here you have the first departure from the Tradition: per Hesiod, the declining sacred religious devotions of people signalled the fall of the golden age into silver, then bronze and iron.  IE, devolutionary descent into skepticism and religious non-observance harms the people rather than the gods.  But of course we live in the modern secular ""kali yuga"" ourselves and so the common inverse of the Tradition principle is the pretext instead.  Well that's enough semiotic interpretation there.  Back to the story.  So anyhow Old Cronos is about to bust loose, and hence the need for Zeus to enlist demigod assistance to whup the titans up oncet 'gin.I wasn't overmuch bothered by this modern heresy against the ancient polytheistic Tradition, since the movie immediately presents not as grand tragedy, but as  fun and humorous.  Rather than the pretentious desacralized ""Troy"" of diretor Wolfgang Peterson, which plods unhappily along without the gods, as a kind of secular revisionist unsuccessful stab at improving the Illiad.The all star cast was not wasted on this film.  Liam Neeson makes a fine Jove, a wee bit humbler than one imagines Zeus Olympias, but it works in the story.  Ralph Fiennes really steals the show as a conflicted Hades who goes the wrong way due to his ressentiment of his brothers, then turns back to the right path in time to save the day.  Unexpectedly, Vulcan has a big role in this film, which I found very imaginative, depicting him as a kind of skinny elder tinkering sage more so than the jealous cripple often conjured by the Hellenic myths.Sam Worthington perplexes as Perseus a bit, overplaying the reluctant hero theme a bit.  I realize he was probably trying to bring value to a simple action role but hey Sam, thats all it really was. The demigod aspect of the character was just backstory.Rosamund Pike plays an Amazonian Andromeda, all dressed up in a tunica intima and bronze greaves etc, leading the phalanx and so forth.  An even odder twist, but one sense that Hollywood now demands a female presence to fetch in more ticket sales.  She played it well even if it was obligatory and she's easy on the eyes for sure.The special effects to me here were totally satisfactory and can't really help being besides the point with this series since the original ""wrath of the titans"" evoked by the title-- the one with Laurence Olivier and Harry Hamlin-- was unforgettable for how cheesy the stop-motion effects seem today.All in all a good rental for watching with one's teenage kids.

379881,"""Re-Animator"" is directed by Stuart Gordon. This sci-fi comedy horror film is based on the H.P. Lovecraft story ""Herbert West-Reanimator"". H.P. Lovecraft was guided by the philosophical principle that life was incomprehensible to human minds, and that the universe was inimical to the interests of humankind. In ""Re-Animator"" this notion is explored as experiments in bringing animals and people back from the dead sets in motion an uncontrollable orgy of madness. Herbert West's experiments are transgressions of societal morality that open the doors of madness upon the medical staff at the Miskatonic University in New England. This film is more comedy than horror with its almost giddy exuberance and over the top handling of grisly reanimations of humans and their body parts. The horror is transcended by this hysterical mania of people creating and then trying to escape from the ever growing chaos of gruesome creations. The obsessions of West, and his nemesis Dr. Carl Hill, to explore the boundaries of the known and transgress moral limits leads to terrible consequences for all, though right to the end of the story the desire by the living to bring back those who have died is represented as the greater need than the incurring folly of the inevitably horrible consequences for the reanimated ones. The world depicted by Stuart Gordon is of an absurd universe where people who are unbounded by moral conscience create chaos for those around them. If you like your horror over the top then this film may be for you.For those that enjoy this film one may want to also check out ""Evil Dead II"", and ""Dead Alive"".",N/A

The Hunger Games was one of the first series I went towards, pretty much because of the Harry Potter like hype and books were getting. After reading the first book of course i was on line to see the film.I have to say what impressed me the most about this film was the actors chosen to play these characters. It seems each actor was picked specifically because they could not only act the parts, but their features and their acting styles were prefect fits. Jennifer Lawrence was great as usual. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson officially broken through and will definitely have work after this franchinse. Still, it was their supporting cast that impressed me the most, especially Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci. The story was very well translated to film, though it is very different from the book it was still great how the story got expanded a little to make it watchable. The only thing I didn't like and it seems to be something almost everyone has issues with. The shakey cam was just a little over done, but I understand why it was filmed the way it was.This was one of the best films I have seen this year and the book along side the film was definitely something I did not expect. A very dark story about survival in a very extreme future. I am hoping that the rest of the films are able to be up to par with this one...minus shakey cam of course.",N/A

He grew up on the other side of the television screens of most of us and he listened and he learned. He became a director because that's where his heart lies. He knows people and based on his own personal experiences with his family he knows how they interact. The hilarious side of the family unit (as well as pathos and sadness) is here in Parenthood and combined with excellent casting this film is a role model for every family, no matter where they live!

1185592,"I used to watch this show back in the 70's when it was still on the air.  Lou Ferrigno did a great job as the Hulk.  Its too bad the show didn't take his career further.  Bill Bixby was great, too.  Even in the face of tragedy- the deaths of his ex-wife, and six year-old son in 1981, he still stayed with the show until its cancellation.I was also happy to get the entire series in a box set.  I wish all TV shows on DVD came that way.  It would save money and space in a TV room.The only thing I didn't particularly like about the show was David's quest to find a way to get rid of the Hulk.  In every episode, being the Hulk kept him from getting killed.  And, if David was such a notorious scientist, why didn't anyone recognize him when he went from place to place?  And, every time he turned into the Hulk, his clothes got ruined and he had to put on fresh ones when he changed back.  How did he fit all those clothes in that tiny bag he carried around with him?I saw an interview with Bill Bixby years ago, and he was asked if there was anything he disliked about the show. He said it was having to wear those white contact lenses because they were so uncomfortable.  I thought, Lou Ferrigno had to wear them longer than Bill Bixby did.I also believe that Ted Cassidy, the actor who narrarated the show's opener, and also did the Hulk's growling and roaring sounds, should have been identified in the show's closing credits as tha narrarator.  Then again, William Daniels was never credited as the voice of KITT, the talking car in the TV show, KNIGHT RIDER.  I guess in the world of show biz, some people don't get the credit, but they sure do get the money.",N/A

414991,"I first experienced this powerful movie during the mid-90's, and it remains one of my favorite films. Director Mathieu Kassovitz scored a bullseye by casting three talented french actors just hitting their stride: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kound&eacute; and Sad Taghmaoui.Much like ""Do the Right Thing"", La Haine shows us what can happen when the inner city of any country reaches it's boiling point. What's important is that the film doesn't glorify violence, it expresses the sentiment that violence ultimately solves nothing.I loved the cinematography, and the opportunity to explore the seedier sides of Paris. The style of shooting and authenticity brought to the characters makes it seem as though you're watching an actual documentary, rather than a fictional account.I was blown away the first time I watched this film, and buying it from Amazon was a great investment. If you want to watch three excellent actors in breakout roles, breathing life into a gritty urban drama, add La Haine to your movie collection.",N/A

964517,"PARADISE NOW(2005)A Moslim film about two Palestinian homicide bombers who run into some difficulties while attempting to infiltrate Israel so as to murder as many Jews as possible when they detonate.A surprisingly reasonably good film that has an almost Hitchcockian feel in its handling of the basic suspense plot. The acting and direction are expert. The film is an interesting presentation of Palestinian culture for those curious. The film is not at all successful in explaining and indeed does not even address the Moslem obsession with death.It is generally anti-Jewish though since it IS from the Palestinian viewpoint that is not necessarily bad form. The film comes dangerously close to being pro-terrorist but pulls back at the last moment. The only fumbles are 1) All the Palestinian whining about being oppressed and living in hell is defeated by the simple fact that the West Bank does not look all that different from parts of Queens or Brooklyn and the residents are shown being able to rent or purchase snuff videos for their home entertainment so what is the big problem?? B) The film keeps insisting that the Homicide bombers are only targeting Israeli soldiers when obviously the reality--aka civilians, women and children--puts the lie to that. And one was amused to see one of the terrorists(who is portrayed as being a nice terrorist who would never blow up children) somehow managing to get on a public bus occupied mostly by soldiers. Uh.Uh. And finally C) the film cheats by ending at the point of detonation and not showing the results of this barbaric war crime.An Israeli film dramatizing the other side needs to be made. One wonders if it HAS been and simply has been prevented from being shown in this country by those great defenders of free speech who tried to censor PATH TO 9/11. In any case, a worthwhile film that is recommended. In Arabic.",Paradise Now

1466431,"I'm one of those rare people that's involved in ministry that will subject themselves to watching these kinds if movies, when you study the bible and get into the theology behind demonic possession you learn a lot that Hollywood gets wrong about demonic possession. To get possessed by a demon there are two ways for this to happen, first you have to open yourself up to the demon through witchcraft, satanism, sorcery, new age spiritualism ect, if your doing that your obviously not a Christian and you will become possessed but to engage in black magik the only way to move in the supernatural is to be in communion with it. Now one other way is through the bloodline there is bible scripture to back this up, don't have the verse off hand but if you reply back and want it, I can provide it later, do if your ancestors or parents or grandparents and do on, we're involved in the activities listed above and never because a christian afterwards and never broke the curse or bondage to the demons they had been in communion with, that demon has legal right to possess the desensdents through the bloodline, look at paranormal activity 3 (spoiler Alert for PA3 if you havent watched that movie please dont read)there was a lot of truth in that movie about a demon been passed down through the family because the mother was a witch that ""thought"" she had control of the demon when she was only a puppet. That's why the demon kept falling the family. The Last Exorcism had a lot of truth to it as well because it was a satanic cult involved and the ending was not the greatest but it was more believable the. This movie The Devil Inside, u actually liked the movie until the 3rd act and I hated the Idea of the demon passing from person to person as a contagious disease, that is a stupid idea and is not an accurate look at possession, if that were to be the case we would all be possessed, I don't like from any of these movies how the powers of darkness are stronger than God in these movies, rubbish I have encountered demons before and they have no authority over me and I'm not scared of them, I have also encountered possessed people before and the only way for them to be free from that possession is through salvation through Jesus Christ and months of counseling and prayer for delivering the demons from them, not ""exorcising"" them. In the book ""he came to set the captives free"" I think that's the right title a lady was a head of the largest witch coven in Europe and she became a Christian, it took several months of prayer and fasting with a minister that does counseling to be delivered of several hundred demons, this sometimes can take a long time.

1518118,"This is why Leonardo DiCaprio is probably the finest actor in the last decade, his acting has become a level of perfection that few ever achieve.The life of J Edgar Hoover portrayed by by DiCaprio is magnificent, he is perfectly suited for this role as he was in the Aviator portraying the unbalanced Howard Hughes. I've seen him grow from Whats Eating Gilbert Grape to the basketball diaries, then to roles such as Marvins room into epics such as the Titanic and titles like Gangs of New york and shutter Island. He never ceases to amaze me in every single performance including this absolutely magnificent role of one of Americas most controversial figures. If anyone but DiCaprio was cast for this I really don't know how I would feel about the film but I will say that it was an intriguing movie that opened my eyes to a man I knew little about.First I'm going to point out that this is a film on the life of a man shrouded with conspiracy and deceit. This film is not an exciting thrill ride but rather an in depth look at a dangerous man with secrets enough to secure a lifetime in an office he built. DiCaprio portrays Hoover as he did Hughes, with a complete immersion in the role itself. In short he makes this movie magnificent. I don't know how he does it but if it was anyone but DiCaprio I may have hated the film but I really don't know because I loved all the cloak and dagger political intrigue hoover seemed to be a master at. I've never seen a film put together like this which keeps my belief that both DiCaprio and Eastwood are masters at their craftsI have read the reviews and I really had to make the choice. Do I ignore a film with this duo? or Do I take the plunge as I did Aviator, Shutter Island, and Inception? I take the plunge and it pays off big, I will add this to my collection. This is a very complicated film to review because so many people are rating it horribly but you have to understand that it is a political cloak and dagger movie. I LOVE cloak and dagger movies and I have always been intrigued in how the F.B.I came to be and how it exercised so much influence. Now I have my answer, It was J Edgar Hoover and he was the keeper of some of the darkest secrets in Americas history..Go into this one expecting it to be a slow grind, a grind of character building coupled with some very sinister twists and turns. This man could walk into the office of some of the most powerful men in our governments history and exercise complete control of events in his favor. It was so interesting that I really didn't mind that it was a slow grind but If you need constant action and cannot sit through a slow movie then you should avoid this movie like the plague. I've seen all of DiCaprio's and Eastwood's works both on and behind the camera. I will tell you it is nothing short of a great movie experience, especially if you ever wanted to know the true inner workings of the F.B.I 's gritty past from humble beginnings to complete power and control. All in the span of hoovers reign of an unprecedented 48 years causing them to limit the term of service to ten years unless higher authority approves it. This should tell you that you are in for some real incite into this mans life and I have really learned much from this film. I will confess that I didn't know much but this has given me incite to expand my knowledge base on the life of HooverThe way the film is built is also very well done. Many people are saying that DiCaprio is ill fit to play this role as a young man but the thing is it is a flashback story set in the form of hoover explaining his life thus jumping from present to past. That being said He was perfect for the role as he played a young man as much as he did an elderly man. DiCaprio excels at these roles as he is able to transition perfectly into a very paranoid ocd type character. He played an elderly man quite well I should add and this film has shown me just the depth that DiCaprio can go in his versatility as an actor. His performance is nothing short of amazing otherwise I wouldn't be able to even attempt a review on this film.If you are a DiCaprio fan then this is something that you should see and as a Clint Eastwood fan you should see this as well if only to see how far he can really go into his talent behind the camera. Be warned that I did say it was slow so if you hate political intrigue and cannot stand slow character and story development then you should stay away from this title as you will probably be very disappointed (Hence the really bad reviews). If you have an open mind and a depth to your movie interests then I suggest at least renting it before completely dismissing it per the majority of the reviews.Well done, as good as it gets for both respected starsThanks for reading, I hope you enjoy the film",N/A

She certainly doesn't do any terpsichorean feats here.  She's clumsy.  Like a cow you want to punch.  Or tip over.  This film may have been a hit upon release, but it is neither Crawford's nor Gable's finest hour by any stretch of the imagination.  A producer, I would think, would at least know his way around a musical number and Gable doesn't know his way around a showgirl in this film.  Yikes.It's putrid.It get's better.

Odd.  It's the oddest musical moment in Crawford's career until the dastardaly ""Two Faced Woman"" number 20 years later.  The bitch can't dance.  Astaire can, and he high-tailed it over to RKO after this mess to team up with Ginger Rogers.And history is made.  Was made.  Will be made.Also in the cast is Franchot Tone, he of the big schwang (supposedly) and the love of Crawford's then life.  Before the kids and all.

1548365,"""Goats"" tracks its main character Ellis Whitman (Graham Phillips), a 15-year-old Arizonan as he leaves the gorgeous desert compound his addled New Age mother Wendy (Vera Farmiga), has decamped to with her trust fund. Ellis has spent much of his early formative years taking treks and toking down with Goat Man, aka Javier, (David Duchovny) with whom he smokes copious amounts of grass and generally hangs out.Ellis heads to an equally gorgeous New England prep school his own absent straitlaced rich father Frank (Ty Burrell) once attended. In fact, his dad had roomed there with the current headmaster, and so the bar is set high for Ellis. He smokes his courses (cut off from his cannabis connection), meets up with other potheads at the school, runs cross-country after some coercion from the hip track coach, declines a liaison with local dining-hall staffer Minnie (Dakota Johnson), who spends her time reading and making extra money off the student bodies. Ellis initially runs afoul of his father Frank during a terse, tense Thanksgiving, but later the pair find their peace and bond.Ellis has to decide where to spend summer break, back in Arizona or with his dad, his step mother, and infant half brother.Well, the critics pretty much gleefully savaged this Sundance film, citing its meandering plot, lack of action, and hybridized comedy-drama tone and comparing the actors and the plot to goats. Cynics are always ready with barbs, but I have to say, this is a fun movie when you don't want 3D special effects, overbearing soundtracks, mutilation and mayhem, and twisted plot lines. In other words, ""Goats"" affords one the chance to just kick back, watch a story without any secret message or theme. It's just a twisted tale, not a study in realism, about choices, growing up, and growing out. We have all done it in one way or another, and the point here is that there is always a story, even if  it is not a cautionary tale or sex romp.It is not a classic movie, but it is a classic case of what happens when critics drip spleen and venom without considering maybe the point of the movie is to meander. I don't think the goats care one way or another but I enjoyed watching it on a Saturday evening.",Goats

We've grown up pronouncing ""The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain,"" but it's still a delight to see Liza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) get it right at last, and send Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and Colonel Pickering (Stanley Holloway) into joy unconfined, dancing and playing at bullfights and collapsing in laughter.And of course the embassy ball, where Liza dances with the prince and convinces Zoltan Karpathy (that hairy hound) that she is a Hungarian princess in disguise, is priceless. So is her day at the Ascot races.Perhaps I'm just too jaded, but I can't help thinking about the fact that Rex Harrison puts more into ""Why Can't A Woman Be More Like a Man"" and ""I Shall Never Let a Woman in My Life"" than he does into ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.""

Eileen Cleary, a devout catholic is nominated for an award, Catholic Woman of the Year. Her subsequent soul-searching, and efforts to make her not so perfect family perfect is the seam that holds this family drama together. I found it believable.

Sitting in the 3rd row from the screen, surrounded by wine colored curtains, waiting for the show to start. I noticed 3 projection booths on the orchestra floor. Not knowing what Cinerama was, I thought it might be a new type of three dimension process. The lights went down, a b&w; mono sound prologue starts. After about 10 minutes into the prologue, I started to get bored. Nothing different about this movie. Then the narrator said ""Ladies and Gentlemen, enjoy your Cinerama Holiday"". The horizontal masking started to rise, the wine colored curtains started to open wider and kept going and going. We were flying through the sky, surrounded in picture and sound. WOW, WE DON'T HAVE THIS BACK HOME""Since that Saturday night at the Stanley Warner Times Square theater, I have been a big time fan of Cinerama. Making sure I saw everything and any thing that was released in Cinerama. In 1996, my wife and I drove for 24 hours (1400 miles) to see a come back of Cinerama in Dayton, Ohio. I flew to Seattle for the ""Reel Cinerama Festival"". I have been to Pacific's Cinerama Theater (fondly refered to as the Cinerama Dome)to see Cinerama productions.When ""How The West Was Won"" was released in ""SmileBox"" on Blu-Ray, I was over joyed.

Cinerama definately ""Puts You In The Picture"" Thanks to the ""Smile Box"" process, it will look like you are watching on a curved screen, which adds to the enjoyment of the film so much.I recommend ""This Is Cinerama"" to anyone who is a Cinerama fan, movie buff or just wants to own a piece of American Cinema history.Yes it is not the same as seeing Cinerama in a Cinerama movie theater, but it is a great experience for any Cinerama fan, and there are thousands of us. No, tens of thousands of Cinerama fans around the world today.You can have the full Cinerama experience this coming month, Sept 28 - Oct 04, 2012. The Pacific Cinerama Theater in Hollywood, Ca will be having a week long festival in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the first public showing of Cinerama on Sept. 30, 1952. Twelve Cinerama Productions will be shown. Plus a new Cinerama film just completed called ""In The Picture"" This marks the first time that actual Cinerama cameras have been used in over 50 years. Five productions will be shown in the original 3 strip film process, Three digital presentations from the original 3 strip films, two digital productions from the 65mm prints and one presented in 70mm Ultra Panavision. All presented on the full 129 degree curved Cinerama screen. I beleive the screen dimensions are 89' wide and 32' high. I might be a little off on the screen size.",N/A

929747,"It is August 1961, Berlin is divided and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) has decided that Western Imperialism and military aggression means that they have to protect East Berlin from the Capitalist wooing of the West. So they start to build a wall.This is the story of Harry Melchior (Heino Ferch) who is a champion swimmer for the GDR but is one of the escapees who got out early when the wall was in its infancy. He has been imprisoned after the 1952 rising and has no love for the methods of East Germany. He has a sister and her family on the other side and once he gets to freedom, he joins a group of like minded Germans to get their friends and families out. They decide to go for the tunnel option as one of their number is an engineer and knows exactly how to do it.This is quite an old film (2000) but I have only just got around to seeing it and it is one of those I should have seen yonks ago. The tension is palpable through out which is some achievement for a film that lasts 160 minutes. The acting is all superb and the claustrophobia of the tunnel is extraordinary.There is also great attention to period detail from the cars to the music and I liked the queues for food that were typical of the Warsaw pact countries at this time, we also get references to the luxury of Trabant ownership!. With love interests, double crosses, action and bags of emotion this film has all points covered.  So for a great film set in Germany that is not about war (well not a warm one anyhow), you can't get much better than this, I thoroughly recommend.",N/A

483289,"THE LONG WAY HOME tells a very often overlooked part of the aftermath of the Holocaust. There have been countless stories about the Holocaust and how people survived in horrific conditions againts impossible odds. Here is the stroy of what one might call surviving the survival. What happened to Holocaust survivors immediately after liberation? Where does a person go when he or she has lost everything and everyone in his life?From the ashes of the Holocaust was born the modern Jewish state of Israel. After liberation, concentration camp survivors became ""disaplaced persons."" Displacement camps were set up to house them. At times they were back in concentration camps and in situations not much better than before. As someone mentions in the documentary, they were back in concentration camps but without the mass killings.THE LONG WAY HOME was the ACADEMY AWARD winning Best Documentary in 1997. With archival footage and interviews with survivors, an heartbreaking story is told. This story focuses on the Jewish displaced persons and the fight to create a homeland in Israel. Officially stateless, most survivors had no homes left. Poland is singled out as a country that denounced returning Jews and communists and less than human. Stories are told of over 40 of 200 Jews in a community being killed by a lynch mob. Only the wretched displaced persons camps had some safety. Attempts were made to cross the Mediterranean into Palestin. The British controlled Palestine and limited the number of refugees alowed in. Thousands of refugees were forced back to Europe or sent to displacement camps on Cyprus.Being a survivor wasn't a cause for celebration or respect from others. Survivor's guilt was strong. One survivor tells of being one of the lucky ones to go to the US. Her family does want to hear about her experiences. In fact, she is told that the Jews in America ""had it rough, too."" This is a story of a nearly destroyed people who fought to live and rebuild their lives.The stories are fascinating as is the archival footage. Stories are told of the British Prime Minister ranting against the Jews. Anti-semitism was in overdrive at the time. For the Jews, a homeland in Palestine was the only solution.This documentary is full of information and thought-provoking stories, but it is one sided as it focuses on the Jewish side of the story. The Arabs in Palestine are portrayed as not willing to compromise with a two state solution - an Arab Palestine and a Jewish Israel. It seems like this issue is worthy of more attention and its own documentary. A lot of questions arise. What happened to other non-Jewish Holocaust survivors? They have a story thats hould be told. What about the Palestinians and the concern over the huge influx of Jewish refugees. There are so many stories here. THE LONG WAY HOME probably could have just focused on the plight of the survivors after liberation - the reactions by American soldiers to the sight of concentration camp survivors, the fact that  many starving survivors died from the shock of having too much food. There is so much here. Certainly, WWII and the Holocaust changed the world forever and generations will be discussing the aftermath of the war.",N/A

4669,"I adore dance movies, and normally I will sit through anything in this genre just to see the dancing - which is usually quite good. This film was an exception. I could forgive its lack of plot, its lifeless acting, its stilted dialogue, and the utter lack of chemistry between Pablo and Sally - but I simply could not forgive the awful dancing. Face it, Potter is a zombie on the dance floor. She has no energy, no spark, no fluidity. Veron had enough verve for the two of them (and it was obvious that the movie was a vehicle for Veron to show off), but that does not compensate for his completely unconvincing dance partner. Why would anyone doing performance tango (which, by the way, absolutely cannot be learned after a lesson in ""walking"" and a trip to Buenos Aires) choose a marionette for a partner? It made no sense. (Well, alright, nothing really made sense in this film.) The one good scene in this film was when Potter goes to Buenos Aires and gets on the floor with a portly older gentleman. THAT is how you dance a tango. Veron could take a lesson or two from that guy.",N/A

632320,"Wes Anderson films are very frustrating in a good way.  The first time I watch one of them, it makes me sleepy.  It's silly, boring, and devoid of feeling, meaning, and emotion.  Then, I watch it again and it becomes more interesting.  The third time, I find myself charmed and amused.  The characters say things that are very emotional, but they don't behave emotionally.  The story finds interesting places to go, but for no reason.  The film has no guiding theme, and yet, everything fits together.  His films are a lot like life.  It makes no sense except by living it.  The Life Aquatic is my favorite film, with The Royal T's a close second.  A sweet picture, but Rushmore is an apple among these oranges.  Don't get me wrong, he doesn't always hit his mark.  That Jeerdarling film, or whatever it's called, is better than Ethan Frome for curing insomnia.  I've tried, but the more I watch it, the badder it is.  But if you stick with him, you will find that Wes Anderson has a unique and playful style that touches the same soft spot as Harold and Maude, Box of Moonlight, and The Station Agent.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

1517226,"Natalie Dessay is an artist whom I admire greatly for her singing, acting, intelligence and musicianship.  This performance is ample reason why.  Here is a well-sung and compelling acted performance of one of opera's more challenging roles.  At times I thought her characterization was a bit edgy - on the verge in a manner more suited to Lucia than to Violetta - but, still, it's a thoughtful and valid portrayal.  Her singing is technically brilliant (as in ""Sempre libera"") and deeply moving (""Addio del passato"") where needed.  I was particularly pleased that she takes both verses of both her arias.  The last several performances of I've seen in the theatre have used these erstwhile traditional cuts.Miss Dessay is well-matched in the Alfredo of Charles Castronovo.  He has a pleasing lyric voice and shows a commendable empathy for a not altogether sympathetic character.  His singing is tasteful and involved, though he does come close to losing the high C at the end of his second act cabaletta.The most serious drawback to this performance is the Giorgio Germont of Ludovic Tezier.  To my ears, at least, his voice is dry and colourless and his technique a bit dicey.  Add to this that he shows about as much emotion as if he were singing listings from the telephone directory and you'll understand the damage he does in the great second act scena with Violetta.  He's no better in his briefer appearances later in the opera.Even the comprimarios are a pretty sorry lot.  It's obvious why these persons are singing with the principals and not as the principals.  Perhaps Mr. Tezier would have been better with them.The updated setting adds nothing to the work and detracts slightly from it.  I'd like the opera to be about persons who are a bit more sophisticated than the bottle-chugging partiers in the first scenes of the first and second acts.  The pointless, though pleasant, choruses of gypsies and matadors in Act 2, Scene 2 seem even more pointless than usual.  Perhaps worst is Violetta's standing-up death, followed by a little stroll across the stage after she's been pronounced dead.On the whole, I would recommend this only for Miss Dessay's Violetta with some additional enjoyment from Mr Castronovo's Alfredo.  As a first, or only, DVD of this opera, I'd go with the Georg Solti version from Covent Garden.",Verdi: La Traviata
1468074,"When I heard that John Carter of Mars was being made with Antonio Sabato, Jr, I had high hopes. They were dashed. The movie didn't make the best use of Edgar Rice Burroughs's stories or his imaginative writing. Most of the elements were in place, but the acting was marginal, even with Antonio's flexing muscles and sharply sculpted cheekbones, but the princess, played by one-time porn princess, Traci Lords, was lacking in everything, especially emotion and acting ability. There was plenty of skin, though. It was not up to my -- or anyone else's -- expectations.Along comes Taylor Kitsch in his turn as John Carter, a slow talking, brilliant man born out of his time and transported to Mars to a world he doesn't understand with abilities and strengths he didn't know were possible. John Carter definitely made the grade. There were some small bobbles, but this all star cast has done a creditable job with Burroughs's story and with the world of Barsoom he created.The special effects do not intrude but work seamlessly with the live actors and, despite everyone wearing at least some clothing, unlike Burroughs's story where the ""red men"" were naked most of the time, the story has been captured admirably. There will always be some difference between books and Hollywood's version, but this version of John Carter is as close as it gets to the book. Bravo!",N/A

Hannibal is known as Hannibal the Cannibal for his horrific murders in which he practiced cannibalism on his victims.Jack thinks that Hannibal, who is a psychiatrist, could help in solving a case involving a new serial killer called Buffalo Bill by using his insight into serial killers and psychiatry.

He won't help but when Clarice is leaving and is soiled by one of the other prisoners he agrees to help her. Hannibal's clues lead her to evidence of an old murder and to a possible link between Hannibal and Buffalo Bill. Hannibal's leads help the investigation but also turn into severe complications....This movie is about the evil that men can do and of a young agent becoming exposed to the world of the criminally insane.

1532521,"When Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr. gave Sherlock Holmes a makeover as more of a quirky, intellectual action hero, the duo managed to recreate Holmes in a unique 21st century way that allowed for an appealing, fun film that actually had a plot.""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" improves on the first film the duo made deepening the great rapport between Holmes and Watson (Jude Law who marvelously reinterprets Watson moving him even further away from the Nigel Bruce interpretation where Watson--an intelligent and sharp individual--was played as a bit of a buffon)taking what's been done with each succeeding actor to play the role. Casting Jared Harris (""Mad Men"", ""Fringe"") as Dr. Morarity gives Downey a perfect foil in the film. Morarity has his own Dr. Watson in the form of Sebastian Moran (Paul Anderson who does a marvelous job)as well making Morarity even more of a doppleganger for Holmes than before as portrayed here.The Plot:Holmes finds himself in the middle of a series of terrorist bombings trying to unravel the role that Morarity is playing in the role of the murder of some of Europe's leaders. Complicating things Watson is getting married and Holmes fears the loss of his partner in solving crime.The film adapts elements from a number of Doyle's stories and integrates original elements as well which makes it both familiar and just different enough for those who have read the stories to be a bit surprised.The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a sharp presentation and the colors are slightly desaturated much like the first film. Detail and grain are quite evident throughout and this is a nice looking presentation of the film.Interestingly, unlike the first film Holmes makes mistakes or seems a step behind at times as he's finally met a worthy advesary in Professor Morarity a man as brilliant as Holmes who takes pleasure in outwitting him.The audio sounds terrific with an immersive lossless presentation. Audio is clear and we do get subtitles in English and Spanish.Now the bad news: If you are an itunes user this uses Ultraviolet which a lot of folks don't care for as it's a streaming service for your computer, etc. It does state it in bold print in the back. According to the fine print (and I'm getting old because I could barely read it), Ultraviolet is not compatable with itunes --unless I misread the fine print--could we print this a bit LARGER next time guys?).You do get a DVD with the film as well as the Blu-ray.Special features include a visual commentary track using the Maximum Movie Mode hosted by Downey, storyboards, ""Focus Points"" (which are also accessible via the Max Movie Mode)and stills galleries. There is a movie ap that can be downloaded to a tablet or phone (I didn't use this on my ipad--wasn't interested in watching two screens at once).The special features that we do get are quite nice and compliment an already fun movie. For those folks that want to watch this on a portable device via itunes, you're out of luck. For those that hate Ultraviolet, you're out of luck. I do wish that Ultraviolet would go away or at least improve at some point but I don't expect that to happen since Hollywood (who, by the way, insists on putting new piracy notices that you have to sit through twice as long--really folks if there are pirates out there do you think 1) they care 2)they didn't use software to skip that and just copy the movie?--end of my rant about fooolish things).""A Game of Shadows"" is an enjoyable adventure and is actually (IMHO) a better movie than ""Sherlock Holmes"" with sharper writing and plotting.This isn't your father's Holmes (whether that be Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Holmes or Basil Rathbone) nor is it the same as the almost sociopathic portayal by the marvelous Benedict Cumberbatch on the BBC series ""Sherlock"")with Downey giving us his own unique performance that hints a the darkness of the character but still makes him fun.If you're willing to give the makers a bit of leeway with the portrayal of Holmes here, you'll enjoy ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"".",N/A

Her aunt, Kim Bassinger, accepts responsibility for her and, only later, encounters a secretive organization that wants to control the child for its own ends.  With a good cop, Smits, she rises to the occasion, in the process reexamining her life and faith.The strongest point of the film is the acting.  Bassinger is not a sex symbol, but a normal woman who is desperate to save a loved one.  Her sister is movingly portrayed as a troubled addict, while the evil protagonist is truly frightening.  Smits is also excellent as a priest turned cop, having found ""another way to serve him.""  The chemistry of these characters works extremely well.  The child is also eminently believable.In addition, though dated the special effects are quite evocative, esp. at the end.  I don't want to give away the plot:  suffice it to say that even though I am a non-believer, I was moved, at times terrified, always interested.  The atmospherics of the film are especially powerful.On the weaker side, the plot was a bit far-fetched, full of chance encounters and desperate moves that didn't quite ring true to me.Recommended.",Bless the Child

1308794,"Virtually the exact same problems as the recent Aussie reboot, ""Tomorrow When The War Began"".I'm convinced now that no modern western filmmaker can ""do insurgent"" any more. There's just too much disconnect between the writers and directors of today because they've never known what it's like to be subjugated, threatened and terrified. We're never going to see the kinds of films like we did after WW2, when so many creators literally lived through the various horrors of war, including being conquered by an invading enemy.Read a story once told by a comic book artist. When he was a young man and first tried his hand at illustration, all he had were comic books to teach him. It took many months of hard work, but he finally completed his first project. Impressed and praising himself for the effort and energy he had put into it, he took the art to the publishers thinking he would be hired on the spot. He wasn't.In fact, he was quickly and repeatedly dismissed. Confused, frustrated, and hurt, he finally asked one of the editors 'why' no one was interested. The editor, seeing that the young artist was suffering, took time out of his busy schedule, sat him down and explained that his work was junk. Why? Because he hadn't studied and learned from real life. A comic book is already a highly interpretive form of art, and when you copy and learn from a skewed version of reality, in turn, your version is utterly bleeped. He told him to take proper art classes, learning to draw from life and studying under qualified teachers, so that only when he was truly ready, he should try again.Readily applicable advice to filmmakers.Writers/directors need to experience the event, live the life, do the deed before putting their concepts into scripts. At the very least, do an intense exploration of the topic they're going to film. Otherwise, it's not a depiction of reality but a distorted caricature. For example: In the scene when the young would-be insurgents throw away food. Talk to survivors of invasions and they'll either laugh in your face or knock you upside your head for suggesting throwing away anything, much less food. During the Siege Of Leningrad - the populace ended up eating their cats and dogs - before turning to cannibalism. A disturbing reference made in the original 'Red Dawn' by Powers Boothe's character.Disconnected = Falsity.This reboot is reflective of so many films today: Superficial, underdeveloped and plastic. In this case, one doesn't really believe they're a bunch of kids who have suffered under the brutal thumb of oppression, much less worked their way to becoming unconventional combatants.I hesitated on this next part because I'm essentially committing plagiarism. To be fair, I'm plagiarizing myself. But I don't see the point of duplicating work already completed. So, from my review of ""Tomorrow When The War Began"" --- Why does everyone's makeup look so even throughout the movie? One of the reasons the original 'Red Dawn' worked was you could see how plain everyone was being virtually makeup free. And, most importantly, looked progressively worse as the film went on - which of course makes complete sense. I'm thinking specifically of Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey who were almost unrecognizable by the movie's final&eacute;. That all the females had their hair and makeup intact throughout the flick doomed this to Hollywood ridiculousness.And I won't go too far beyond noting that, apparently, Chris Hemsworth is the only male Wolverine who has been through puberty and growing facial hair.The film's few positives are found when Jeffrey Dean Morgan and crew show up. But the amusing conflict of veteran combat marines being made to look silly by a bunch teenagers doesn't provide enough energy to recover from its creative death spiral.Which of the two reboots hit an uglier target? I'll go with 'Tomorrow' as a larger fail. Reboot Red Dawn works better because of Hemsworth and Morgan; and because first-time director Dan Bradley's background as a stuntman made the final action sequences engaging.Still, if you screen either production, prep yourself for dissatisfaction and disappointment.Personal Notes:- The one aspect I was looking forward to was the airborne assault. And again we see filmmakers with absolutely no experience improperly showcasing a tactic that could so easily been addressed with the assistance of a military advisor. Paratroopers without rucks, heavy equipment being dropped simultaneously with personnel, and an entire bleeping division jumping directly into a city as their drop zone. Which moron came up with that idea? If it's the listed veteran - Dotan Baer - then something got seriously lost in the translation or he flat out failed his job.- I won't rip the producers for turning the enemy into North Koreans. The Chinese literally have our fiscal sacks in their grip. And you can't tick off your bankers because they can squeeze harder than you can poke.- Connor Cruise, Tom's kid.

Bourne spends a few nights on Coke binges and other nights trying to uncover the conspiracy that created him and his new identity.This is a film of boundless action and international intrigue, it is the stuff that nightmares are made of. Director Paul Bluegrass does a superb job of delivering a gritty yet concise view of a world divided by borders and McDonalds franchises covered in blood. Jason Bourne has no problem overcoming trained assassins and mercenaries, but continues to struggle with cell phone reception. The pacing is such that Bourne hasn't a chance to eat, sleep or shave. This film is a must see for the citizens of Algeria.2.342",N/A
1524813,"If you've ever seen the movie ""Forrest Gump"", you are familiar with the concept of ""the journey"" being more than ""the resolution"" in film-making.  Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" is based on a similar concept...only instead of a bench-sitting, story-telling Southerner, this time the journeyer is of the equestrian variety.For a basic plot summary, ""War Horse"" is a conglomeration of tales surrounding a rather remarkable horse.  Raised by a young boy as a plow horse in an Irish farm, the horse eventually finds itself in the thick of World War I, where it changes hands on a number of occasions, building drama along the way.At its core, ""War Horse"" is two things:First, it is a World War I period piece, which it succeeds at just fine.  The battle scenes are intense, the time period looks/feels about right, and the impact of the war on the surrounding territories is a nice addition that usually isn't covered in these sorts of flicks.Primarily, though, ""War Horse"" is a human-centered drama that tells its story through the travels of the horse.  Every person who comes into contact with the horse has an interesting backstory of their own, and Spielberg does a good job of fleshing them all out and still keeping them relevant in the end.The only reason this isn't a five-star film is because some of the situations the horse encounters fall (at least in my opinion) widely beyond the realm of possibility (in favor of high drama, of course).Overall, ""War Horse"" is a solid film that will attract a wide variety of audiences.  Whether you prefer action/adventure, romance, human drama, animal tales, or war stories, this movie has something you will enjoy.  The film can also be enjoyed by all but the youngest of children (as the war scenes are not too graphic as to scare off grade-schoolers).",N/A

109470,"This was, by far, the nicest catalogue release I've bought this year. Some have criticized the lack of supplements on this Blu-Ray (which, I partly understand); but considering the treatment other releases from the 80s (and even 90s) often get - watching this disc was truly a mesmerizing experience - and probably miles better than it ever was in theaters. I have re-watched it twice since I got it and was equally impressed on all three viewings. It gave me goosebumps on several occasions. (""I'm on f***ing fire!"")I could go on and on about the PQ, but suffice to say the print appears to be in excellent shape, no artificial sharpening/DNR/EE has been performed to the transfer (that I could detect), and it also looks pleasantly movie-like with a fine layer of grain. The numerous ""vision-sequences"" also look very impressive. Quite frankly, the microphotography and other effects have held up extremely well-surpassing even 2001 in many scenes! Audio-wise, the DTS HD MA track is enveloping, with clear dialogue and dimensionality; none of the flatness often associated with 5.1 remasters is present here at all.Naturally, good PQ and AQ does not make a movie (ref. numerous technically flawless blockbusters this year), so the most important aspects of the film-its basic premise and underlying storytelling is also very engaging and fresh, and the film avoids many of the pitfalls/clich&egrave;s that other movies in this genre often fall into. (Although you could say this movie is in its own genre altogether, but that is a different topic!) :)If all this wasn't enough to give this Blu-Ray a spin in your theater, the performances by William Hurt, Blair Brown and Bob Balaban are all top-notch.Very highly recommended!",N/A
366539,"""Marooned"" (1969), starring some heavy-hitting talent (including Gregory Peck, Gene Hackman, David Janseen, and James Fransicuss) shows how a slow, measured, methodical pace with each frame filled with intelligence can succeed brilliantly where so many of today's short-attention-span-geared films fail miserably.  The nicely-serviceable special effects, the attention to detail that rivals/surpasses that of ""2001: a space odyssey"" (the hardware is firmly-grounded on then-present day technology), the slow, plodding nail-biter pace, and the fine acting all make for a great film.  While there are those who think that the slow pace makes this a boring film, I submit that these critics are more often than not of the ""raw-meat/15-minute-maximum attention span/Rambo"" school of film fandom.  However, if you are aching for an intellectual gem of a film that acknowledges that you've actually got a brain -- case in point: this film portrays the Russian space effort (which was, back in '69, the only other manned space game in our global village) in a respectful light -- then ""Marooned"" is just what the doctor ordered.

1418747,"I am blown away by what I just saw. Christopher Nolan concludes the trilogy with perfect thoroughness and yet makes you think at what you had just seen after you've left the theater. Nolan throws curve balls galore throughout this film, and I actually gasped in awe and excitement at a few particular moments that would be blasphemy if I told you.Taking place 8 years since the events in ""The Dark Knight."" Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)is a broken recluse, taken care of by maids and hobbling along on his cane, he has put the Batman behind. Until Bane arrives(Tom Hardy),with an army and as the current leader of ""The League Of Shadows"" to finish what Ra's Al Ghul(Liam Neeson)failed to do in ""Batman Begins.""Bane is a monstrous brute, a man born in the darkness and destined to burn Gotham to the ground, releasing all criminals from Blackgate Prison and trapping the city's police force underground. But where is Batman?After an epic battle between Batman and Bane, Bruce ends up defeated and placed in the bowels of a Ukrainian underground prison, body broken, while Gotham citizens are unprotected by the anarchy and under the watch of Bane.Will Bruce ""rise"" one last time, and will ""Catwoman""(Anne Hathoway)quit her clepto ways and help Batman? And who is this Lt.Blake(Joseph-Gordan Levitt)and why does he know Bruce so well?Solid performances from everyone, and surprisingly Tom Hardy himself, who played Bane. His face is never seen, but his eyes and menacing tone made me shiver. The new ""Bat"" toy is pretty damn sweet. Of course Anne looked stunning as Catwoman, but I wish she had more screen time.As always, Nolan doesn't just make superhero action movies, he makes films. Lots of emotion in this film, which even had, IMO, an ""Inception"" like ending, making you wonder, Is that? That's Not? Could it be?  And that is the splendor of a Nolan film. Easily the best superhero movie ever, which was ""The Avengers"" until now.Nathan Cranes(Cillian Murphy) appearance as a judge of the citizens was a perfect addition to the insanity of the character and the situation. Very humorous and dark, it reminded me of Frank Millers Batman.And thank you Christopher Nolan and everyone involved in the making of the greatest hero trilogy of all time. This is the way Batman is done, DARK, AWESOME, and EPIC. No need EVER for a reboot.",The Dark Knight Rises

But I continued watching because I have known women to have that type of personality.  It was the middle half of the movie that shook me to the core. Her character changes completley as would anyone who goes through the conflict she must deal with.  The life changing experience (a daughter she clearly cherishs is taken away for (innocent?) sexual misconduct)  forces Keeton's character to ""grow up"" makes the movie fabulous.

But, what you know, this movie was actually pretty good.I recognized most of the actors from other movies/tv shows. I was kind of surprised they were in this movie and their acting skills proved to me that they were good actors to go onto better shows/movies after this.I found the story to be believable, except one part. Real sharks don't really want to eat humans. In addition, the idea of sharks to wanting to hunt down and eat all the humans is really dumb concept too. But, hey, it's a scary movie, and most scary movies have dumb concepts...so I guess, it could work. I just have to go with it and believe it's true....be a little stupid if you may. lolEveryone knows that Black people are used in scary movie as people to die first or the ones to get killed while to saved the group, well this movie, they thought ahead of time. They did not used Black people at all. Nope. They are kicked out. You can't find a single Black person in the whole movie. I dare you to find one. You can't! That's how prepared they were.Now, who did they used to replace the black people in the movie...umm Asian? Yup. That's right. There's so many Asians in this movie you would think you were watching a foreign movie. That's right, the writers replaced all the Black roles and made them Asian roles. They even use Asian extras! Wild idea. Just wild. Asians must be coming up in the world. It's like watching a whole new concept. So now, I don't see another Black guy getting killed right from the get go, but it's a Asian brother.

416289,"LOVED IT!  Very suspenseful!Set in the late 1800's, Val Kilmer plays a military engineer who loves building bridges and has passionately desired to go to Africa his whole life.  He gets his chance when a British bridge project in Africa is going poorly and he is sent to take over and get it done on a very tight schedule.Unfortunately, there are some male lions in the area working together (they never share territory much less work together) and killing for pleasure (not food) and Kilmer is losing workers left and right to these vicious man-eaters.Construction is at a standstill, the workers want to leave the area, but (after 30 deaths) the British agree to hire a renowned hunter who should resolve the lion problem in a few days so they stay and give Douglas and his group of native hunters the benefit of the doubt.  After the first hunt together, the African hunters decide the lions are ghost-demons and they leave.The man-eating lion duo continue to outsmart Kilmer and Douglas and keep boldly taking more lives. Finally after a particularly deadly attack (mass victims) the remaining workers leave and it's just Kilmer, Douglas and a friend against the deadly lions.NOTE: there is a bit of a gore factor to this movie because they show bodies of some of those attacked, and because Kilmer and Douglas use blood (fakey looking) and large animal chunks as bait.  I think the majority of us can handle it, but easily squeamish folks may not want to see this.This movie is interesting, scary/suspenseful and believable (though it is a fictionalized story per Wikipedia).

1503203,"I've never been a big fan of message movies. It seems far too often the message gets lost in the whims of the director or actor involved and the real story is buried. But occasionally a movie comes along where the story being told, the facts beneath it all, are so strong that they ease their way into you brain and ferment there, taking hold and forcing you to witness what it was all about. THE WHISTLEBLOWER is one such movie.It's 1999 and Rachel Weisz stars as Kathryn Bolkovac, a police woman with problems. Her ex-husband has sued for and won full custody of their daughter and is moving her to Georgia. Kathryn requested a transfer to the Georgia State Police but they don't have any openings at the moment and with a mortgage to worry about she can't just up and move. Then fate steps in and provides her with a chance to make great money for just 6 months work. That job is as a privately run security force connected to the United Nations forces working in Bosnia.Kathryn takes the job thinking she'll just be doing regular police work in another country, helping folks in need and having her back watched by fellow officers. Her first taste of controversy arrives when she comes to the aid of a Muslim woman constantly beaten by her husband. The local police could care less since she's a Muslim. Through her knowledge of law and the with the help of a sympathetic officer, Kathryn gets justice for the woman, a first concerning Muslim women in the area. This comes to the notice of others at the United Nations.Kathryn is offered a chance to work in the Human Rights commission and jumps at the chance. During one of her investigations she learns of a group of young girls who have been severely abused to the point of torture. In talking to them they lead her to investigate a local bar where she finds pictures of the girls being sexually and physically abused in the worst conditions possible. A room with dirty mattresses and chains to hold the girls is found with used condoms and needles strewn around. In checking the pictures she finds Kathryn discovers that various members of the private contractor peace force she joined are a part of this group as are members of the local police.Kathryn takes this news to her supervisor and is asked to pursue the matter. She talks one of two girls into testifying about the abuse and the men who were involved. Called away, her ally in the force takes the girl to testify only to be ambushed and have her taken from him. Returned to the hole she was removed from, the young girl is tortured in front of the rest on hand as a way of showing them what will happen if they talk.Kathryn continues to search for the young girl in hopes of finding her and honoring her promise to keep her safe. Seeing the girl's mother who arrived before she was taken only causes Kathryn more pain. With no one to help her, with all those around her viewing her as the enemy, she finds aid in the group she's worked for at the UN.  Can she save this young girl in time?The end of the story in real life had so so results. The employees of the company involved in the story were removed from the area but not tried in court. An investigation into human trafficking was begun and the depth of the problem was unimaginable. But the costs involved were high. The career of Kathryn Bolkovac was ruined. The problem though slowed remains.The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't pull punches. It wants you, the viewer, to realize just how bad the situation is. It wants you to see just how hopeless the lives of these girls become. And it wants you to know that there are people in this world possessed of an evil so overpowering that human life means nothing to them. In a world where we consider the disruption of cable in the middle of a game to be horrific, its hard to imagine a world like that depicted here. But perhaps with movies like this more people will be made aware.Weisz does a tremendous job here pulling out both the naive ness of her character at first and then the realization that she may have taken on more than she could handle. The feeling of being helpless in a foreign land, of not knowing who you can trust, is on full display in her performance and she does it with ease. You will believe she is Kathryn Bolkovac. And you will realize that this problem is not one that will go away easily.","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"

1521492,"This is an excellent DVD for the serious beginner and it will take you beyond the initial learning of a form. Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is an icon in the martial arts world and, as such, does a wonderful job of introducing Yang Style tai chi to the beginner.Each move of the long form is broken down to it's structure, martial application and it's usefulness to health and flexibility. In addition to showing how a move is performed, Dr. Yang also shows how it should not be done. For example, many new beginners project the rear when doing moves such as parting wild horses mane or ward off. He very clearly shows how tucking the tail bone under will give the body more roundness and grounding. I find that a very useful way to learn, because sometimes we just don't process all the nuances of a stance at first look. It is good to know exactly what we are doing incorrectly and to be shown how to correct it.The DVD runs for almost 5 hours, so it is not a quick run through of a short form. There is a great deal of information shared and it is presented from various angles to make it easy to see all of the details. The skill level is listed as beginner and it will be easy for a beginner to understand and follow. I found many useful tips in this presentation of the long form. I have been teaching tai chi for 15 years. There is always something to discover, even in the simplest of movements.The filming of the movements is quite nice; outside, on a mountain top with beautiful soft music. A rooster crowing in the background brought a smile to my face when Dr. Yang stopped is lesson and apologized for the noise. He said, ""we live in the mountains"". I also liked his humbleness when he performed an application with a student and was surprised that it was hard to do. He said, ""I am getting old and he is getting stronger, that was hard"". Not often you will hear a Grandmaster admit that he has to work at a move.All in all, this is a wonderful value for the beginner and those looking to move beyond the surface of tai chi.",Yang Tai Chi for Beginners

1178187,"This is a well-recorded and performed production of the Nutcracker. However, a word of warning needs to be put for those expecting a 'traditional' production. This is a new staging and interpretation dating from 2001, with a completely different conceptual emphasis for many of the characters and their roles. The costuming and staging is bright and effective and works well in this production. The music is played in a refreshingly fleet manner and this accompanies effective steps in a modern way that I find a little ungainly at times but understandable in the circumstances - Clara is an unloved child at a transitional age in this production for example. Unsuspecting loved children expecting a kind artistic experience might find this rather unsettling although there are many unloved children in real life of course.However there are fine alternatives. There is one for those who would prefer the 'traditional' Peter Wright version familiar to the Royal Ballet followers and which has been filling Covent Garden for years. For those who are familiar with this production there is nothing unexpected about this version and all is danced with the utmost skill within a lavish stage setting. The sound is excellent as is the camera work. This will be the perfect version for huge numbers of people and as such comes with the highest recommendation. It would be a Nutcracker of choice for many people.There are others available which may also appeal. My personal favourite is the Bolshoi Ballet production with choreography by Grigorovich who has a wonderful sense of the epic and knows how to make the most of the large spaces provided by his theatre at the Bolshoi. Anyone who knows the Spartacus ballet for example will be aware of this. There are many breathtakingly beautiful sequences throughout his production - the corps de ballet in the Waltz of the Snowflakes being but one example. The character dances in Act two are refreshingly imaginative while remaining essentially traditional. The Pas de Deux of the Prince and Marie towards the end of Act 3 rises to climatic lifts that do not disappoint emotionally. One could go on and on .......!I also like the San Francisco American setting of the ballet as an alternative version which is largely traditional in flavour and which has a refreshingly different selection of character dances to offer. The Arabian Dance is especially effective in my opinion.Currently we are spoiled for choice, there being well-recorded versions to suit a wide variety of taste as described above. This is one of the least safe in my opinion because of its relatively dark concept, although very fine in its own way. Safer, more 'traditional' options would be the Royal ballet version along with the excellent Bolshoi version. The San Francisco Ballet is also worth considering.For my taste I would choose this as a good alternative and rather dark view. However, I find the San Francisco production kinder and would choose either the new Royal Ballet or the Bolshoi version as my favourite single best buy - essentially traditional, well performed, well recorded and crucially, a kinder experience.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)I particularly like your format of review.

1264976,"In many ways, MGM's 1930 production of THE BIG HOUSE remains the ultimate movie about men behind bars. It's the very first serious handling of the subject, establishing the general narrative devices prison films have copied and improvised ever since. However, unlike all those others, THE BIG HOUSE is different in that it's an archetypal depiction of everything we've come to associate with the genre. Even after eight decades it still packs quite a wallop, especially in its grim prison riot climax.Expertly directed by George Hill, THE BIG HOUSE top bills Chester Morris and Wallace Beery in standout roles as hardened cell mates in a badly overcrowded penitentiary run by a tough but compassionate warden, played by Lewis Stone. Robert Montgomery is a newly incarcerated prisoner whose nerves begin to unravel under the pressure. Pretty Leila Hyams plays Montgomery's sister and Morris' sweetheart.THE BIG HOUSE contains several memorable scenes, one of which takes place in the prison chapel where the convicts are reciting The Lord's Prayer while under the pews they're passing guns and bullets to each other in preparation for their crashout on Thanksgiving Day. They also sing the hymn, ""Open the Gates"", which has a perversely ironic twist Morris and Beery appreciate, eyeing each other knowingly. The big riot sequence itself is well staged with a gritty authenticity that's quite forceful even today. The film's strengths were recognized by the Academy, winning for best screenplay and best sound recording. The large prison set and grounds were reused by Hal Roach the following year for Laurel and Hardy's first feature length film, PARDON US (1931).The DVD-R of THE BIG HOUSE from the Warner Achives seems to have been transferred off the same master used for the VHS release. While a bit soft - most likely due to the source print - it's still a very nice image, with excellent contrast and no lines, scratches or white specks. The audio contains some pops and hiss which could've been cleared up by an extensive restoration, but it doesn't detract from enjoying this presentation which is the best I've seen on this great antique.THE BIG HOUSE is a film that's been copied a lot, and although I've seen several prison movies, I find myself always coming back to it. I especially like its vivid, straightforward style, and the hard bitten edge that's offset by some genuinely tender moments. Its age works to its advantage, making it seem almost like a documentary of prison life in 1930. Watching the film perspectively, one can sense just how influential it was destined to become.Highly recommended.",N/A

Perhaps this should be renamed to Twilight: Breaking Hymn (did I spell that correctly? *cough*), since it was a naughty song of love. The moon through yonder window did break, and its light in and out of the window did shine, all night long, until the bird cried out in the morning, ""coo! coo!""

Some people say they prefer it, that it is better paced and that the added scenes of the extended edition are just filler. Well if that's how you feel than you are clearly not a true fan and should not watch this movie at all. This version should not even exist.

1301471,"A boring married couple (Tina Fey and Steve Carrel) with kids try to spice up their life by going to a trendy club and impersonating another couple to get their exclusive table. But it turns out that the people they are impersonating have connections with a crime lord, corrupt police and much worse. It started out slow to show how boring the life of the couple really was and put the question out that continuing this type of life would lead to divorce (per their friends who announced they were divorcing). The humor is sometimes on and sometimes off but there is an impressive and known cast which includes: Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, James Franco, Ray Liotta, William Fichtner and Common. There are some good enough ties to romantic relationships and the risks they suffer if you make things too predictable. The pace picks up once they get to the trendy club. They should have shaved off 5 minutes in the early part of the tale. The budget for this film was roughly $55M and yielded over $152M at the Box Office.

340557,"Before he played the Hunchback with exquisite pathos, before he strutted as Henry VIII, Charles Laughton gave us a classic vision of the Mad Scientist in full efflorescence.  This character has something about him to suggest a little of the mythos surrounding the figure of Kurtz from Heart of Darkness, and, like Kurtz, would have been well qualified to utter as his final words: ""The Horror! The Horror!""Robotics professor Masahiro Mori was probably not thinking of Dr. Moreau when he first described the psychological phenomenon of the weird sense of revulsion that people experience when confronted with robots that pass a certain threshold of verisimilitude with human beings. Beyond a certain point, staring into the black, lifeless eyes evokes the opposite of a sense of empathy, and the creep factor overwhelms us. It seems to be a hard wired instinct that may be related to identification of potential mates, or avoidance of disease--but the first time I saw M'ling, the monkey servant of Montgomery, I fell deeply into the Uncanny Valley. The feeling persisted every time I saw one of the Man-imals, and when the claws came out on Panther Woman, the creep factor was almost more than one could bear. Mind you, these are not Robots or Androids or CGI animation, but the half human half beast hybrids produced much the same effect--which is striking.One doesn't have to look far to consider the bestial origins of human behavior in terms of the attacks of Genghis Khan, the Nazis, the Khmer Rouge, The Tutsi engendered genocide, to mention but a few of the exhibits that fill Humanities Hall of Shame.  When the Sayer of the Law invokes the response ""No spill blood!"" It sounds like a lesson that should be learned by humans, first. This reminds me of the answer given by Mahatma Gandhi when asked what he thought of Western Civilization--""I think it would be a very good idea!""One could argue that HG Wells goes a very long way to make a point--but it is a point that should be a Zen Koan never forgotten by the mass of humanity--and contemplated daily in every meditation--because, we are after all a monkey wrapped around a horse wrapped around an alligator--it doesn't take much to agitate the inner alligator, and coupled to the cleverness of the monkey brain, it makes us very dangerous, indeed.""What is the Law?""""Are we not Men?""",N/A

The movie also stars Michelle Phillips, Mama's & the Papa's fame and Knots Landing fame, she gave a good performance.

For this I cannot emphathise with the organist and it little matters he was being egged on. Why was he keeping such bad company in the first place ? The antagonists were not 12-13 yr old bullies or wierdly experimental  kids, too young in  judgement to sense the risks. No,  they looked at least 17yrs maybe 18yrs at the time. It is very disturbing to try to imagine just what KIND of mental/ physical/abuse did they had in mind "" Go ahead do something!!"" his friend urges,  obviously with dark expectations. The little boy was panicked enough to run straight over the embankment. But not before telling  them he knew them, which was probably the only reason the organist baulked.So they get done for manslaughter. But were they nonces in training ??!!  Nipped in the bud?  Then sorry,  all that self righteous redemption I -been -saved by playing the organ doesn't hack it. Seems like sublimation to me.

He should have become active in community service to convince me not lingering in the shelter of the church becoming .....ugh....healed.The church talks of the innocence of lambs. According to this sanctimonious garbage its allowable to slaughter the lamb for the joys of repenting a sinner. Ethically this film is up the spout. What of the golden boy robbed of his good life FOREVER ? Whose dying moments were filled with the horror of wishing he was in his mother's arms?. Not on the joys of going to heaven.

1461964,"13(released Oct/11)stars Sam Riley as Vincent ""Vince"" Ferro,Mickey Rourke as Patrick Jefferson,Ray Winstone as Ronald Lynn Bagges,Jason Statham Jaspar Bagges and a surprise appearance from veteran actor Ben Gazarra,as one of the bettors.13 is one heck of a disturbing film that has its own tempo,and if you happen to get left behind,too bad.One must make alot of assumptions and put the pieces together as it goes.In other words,it makes you think on the fly.Sometimes a good thing,here not so good.The story finds Riley as an electrician/renovator.He has a relative in the hospital for whom he must remortgage the house in order to pay his bills.One day on his job he overhears the house owner talking about the receiving of an envelope that will make him alot of money.The man suddenly dies and Riley grabs the envelope.Outside the authorities are monitoring the envelope's delivery and the person that will use it.Riley gets home and opens it to find detailed instructions and a phone number.He follows them to a tee and gets picked up and taken to a remote house in the woods far away from New York City.It is there he finds out what it is that he has to do to earn the money.He has become the unwilling participant in a sick and deadly game of 13 man Russian Roulette.They stand in a circle,each with a gun pointed to the head of the one in front of them.They are told to cock their gun hammers,then wait for a round bulb with the mark of a spider on it,to come on.Then they simply shoot and see who drops dead.There are three initial rounds,with each man receiving one bullet on the first,two on the second and three on the third.The men come from varying backgrounds,some brought there against their free will and others willing participants.The survivors move on to the finale.Statham has put his brother,who has been in and out of a psych hospital,in this sick game for three times running and who is the standing champ.He has made alot of money off of his brother.Riley on the other hand had no idea what it was all about and is at first extremely nervous and distraught.As the game progresses he becomes resigned to his fate and Statham's brother's taunts just steel his resolve to get through it.As it would happen,Riley and Winstone make it to the finale.Both men are given the necessary three bullets each,and stand facing each other and at the ready to shoot.When the bulb comes on,there are two empty clicks heard and both men stand.It then goes on to the next round and four bullets are given each man.When the bulb goes on Winstone lays dead on the floor and underdog Riley is the survivor.He is given $1,850,000 for his troubles.When those who bet heavily on him to win offer him a lift to the train station,he realizes they want his money.Riley sneaks away and gets to a train station.While at the station the authorities move in on him.He temporarily ditches his money and is taken in for questioning.Riley plays dumb and is eventually let go.He gets his money,mails it home and hops aboard the train.Statham has lost not only his brother but millions of dollars and finds Riley and stalks him aboard the train.When the time is right Statham shoots Riley in the stomach several times and flees with the money bag(filled with just clothes and a stuffed animal).Before Riley dies he swallows his postal receipt so no one will know about the money.The film closing has Statham fleeing through a deserted pedestrian tunnel.The film gets to its point in a quick enough fashion but its set up can leave one with alot of questions,questions which the film will not stop to answer and hopes either you pick up later on or somehow figure out on your own.There is no explanation at all to Rourke's character,just that he is some tough hombre' that was stewing in a Mexican jail for...who knows why? For some reason they gave Stathams brother's character(Winstone) some filling out as we are first introduced to him as just another participant.Then there's a flashback as to where he came from and how he got there,and it shows the tension between the two brothers.And that ending of Statham steeling away with what he thinks is Riley's winnings,leaves one scratching ones head.Statham disappears through the other end of the tunnel and the camera just hangs there watching for about 10 seconds.....then it suddenly fades to black.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There is a featurette and interviews.But for the most part,what is in the interviews is in the featurette!Kind of a waste of space,if you ask me.All in all an uneven film with its premise,of men being either willing or unwilling participants in a human ring of Russian roulette,being a very disturbing one indeed.The film makes no apologies for it and as a viewer I can accept it.I think my criticism here lies in just HOW the story was told and executed,one might say.",13

From a trick bullet, defiance of physics and ignorance of thousands of hours of eye-witness testimony this video has it all, and it all adds up to sweet zilch. Sadly, the ugly propaganda head of the lame-stream media has continued to rise. Dan Rather of CBS forged Bush's National Guard documents. NBC altered George Zimmerman's 911 call. MSNCB cropped a video of an armed black man to make it seem like a white guy brought guns to an Obama rally. And most all the media continuously ran pictures of Trayvon Martin at age 12 and George Zimmerman photo-shopped to look ""white"". The media looks at the one half of our population that always falls for their crap and thinks we are all that stupid. When will they learn that this is folly?  If you want the truth, go to YouTube and search for JFK ASSASSINATION videos. The best one around is the series, subsequently banned, called THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY.

If you want a fine copy do it yourself as it's good hobby and you'll get satifacation knowing you have the finest print available. My friend's studio restored 78 rpm record and recorded them to tape, first at a faster speed for imperfections and latter to a slower speed for sound qualityWar is boring and the last fifteen minutes of a battle is exciting if you like being in a war.

I remembered the news back then when they reported the crash of the plane, and that there were survivors, but I never really knew the details of how they were found.  The story is so unbelievable that I'm really haunted by it.  In short, I recommend that people read the book first, then watch the film, because after reading the harrowing story you will become even more blown away when you watch the film and see the unbelievable obstacles faced by these boys who were so determined to live that they absolutely performed miracles.  Parrado is an amazingly humble man considering what he accomplished, and he'll become your hero.  One of the best documentary films I've ever seen.",N/A

145662,"This is one of my favorite movies and one that has a deceptively complex morality question deep inside the sometimes kitschy ideas of the future as seen through an early 1970s lens. A whole generation of people have been born and grown to maturity who haven't seen it and I sure hope the large number of reviews and continued sales on Amazon will introduce them to this great movie.First off, this is one of the ""Holy Triad"" of Charlton Heston's sci-fi films. The other two are Planet of the Apes and Omega Man, of course. Both very worth a see as well. Also shining in this movie are Edward G. Robinson in his final film appearance (and it is a poignant and beautiful role for him) and Joseph Cotton in a brief but pivotal role.The story centers on a murder that Thorn (a cop played by Heston) investigates in a near future New York City where over-population and increasing environmental damage have nearly destroyed the modern way of life. Thorn's ""Book"" named Sol (a type of research assistant) played by Robinson uses some loot that Thorn found at the scene of the murder to open up clues to a conspiracy that is so dark and far reaching that it will shake the world if it comes out. What follows is the exciting, tragic and heartbreaking search for the truth.Some of the most important parts of the movie are those that are least talked about. If you think about these almost subliminally disturbing aspects of the film, one can be left with a new and very strange take on morality in difficult situations.One: The question of furniture. In this future, the very wealthy live in apartments that we might see as middle class today and have access to things like real meat (though not great quality) and actual fruits and vegetables (also not great but real). They also have humans included with the furniture and actually call them such. In this case, it is Shirl, a pretty girl whose function is obvious and like a good couch, meant to be comfortable and unobtrusive for the owner of the apartment. For most of us the thought is totally appalling, but is it really? In a world where most won't live to adulthood and death is likely to be drawn out and horrible, furniture live lives of relative security for at least as long as they are young and pretty. Interesting question.Two: Death and Suicide. In this future, the living are too numerous and it can't be sustained. The plankton that fed such a populous as the world dustbowled have now also died out in the super heated future. In response to this, the government sponsors beautiful places where anyone can go to ""go home"". It is nothing short of an assisted suicide/euthenasia clinic. It is also one of the only places of peace and beauty left for anyone. When Sol finds out what he does during his research and goes to one he has one of the most beautifully filmed and realized death scenes in movie history. It is perhaps even moreso since Mr. Robinson never had another film appearance before his own death. Thorn finds him and tries to stop him, but it is too late and in seeing how this plays out for those who go there to die, one can almost see the positive morality of such a place in such dire world circumstances. It is, after all, the choice of the person who goes there...no one elses.Three: Ultimate Recycling. SPOILERS HERE. Most people know the line...""It's made of People!!"". Not all of them know that it is from this movie, which is amusing. In the final scene of the movie we see Thorn trying to get the word out that Soylent Green...once made of plankton for protein...is actually made of the people who go to die at the euthenasia centers. We also see that no one is listening. While our initial reactions as this is discovered during the course of the film is one of disgust, it does beg the question...why? The world is too full of humans and there is no longer the resources to bury them all as they leave this world. What do you do with them? In this future, they break them down into slurry...just the basic proteins...and make a type of cracker out of them. When we consider that the FDA has an allowable amount of contamination for food that is human in nature, it changes the metric some. Is it, in reality, any different than the wonderful crops that come in the years after a battle happens on a field? It's equally appalling and thought provoking.Four: Environment and humanity. One of the most interesting responses I've seen to this movie happens in the first couple of minutes. A montage of scenes depicts real life progress and the pollution that it brought. Most often I hear a comment about how realistic that looks for a 1970s movie. What most are surprised to hear is that almost all of them are real images of real life. How shocking that is to people born after the Clean Air and Clean Water acts. Younger generations have no idea that LA used to be so smog choked that people died or that swimming in a natural body of water could easily kill you or give you cancer quickly. While I'm generally against too much intervention by government I'm often surprised that anyone could ever assert with a straight face that people in business to make money will police themselves and won't intentionally harm the environment. I remember the time before the government forced companies to stop spewing filth into the air and water. Those images of what our country looked like are worth seeing the movie for all by themselves. They are eye-opening.Overall, there is a great deal of 1970s fashion and style that many today will find laughable and there is always that wrongness that happens when trying to imagine a near future (like the video games), but the movie itself is sound and entertaining. It is also dark and mature in nature. It's an excellent film that will appeal to those who like sci-fi, dystopian movies or classics of the age.",N/A
319242,"I kind of really loved this.  I thought that the film's overall cinematic flow was priceless.  The black and white cinematography was possibly the best in the year and the film's brisk editing helped keep my interest tightly wound on every frame.  More than anything else, I loved the way that Joan Micklin Silver worked very hard to create a nostalgic feel to the film that relished in the era it was depicting.  The opening sequence, the baseball scene, the picnic; all scenes that call to mind the best of silent cinema.  Place atop that the beautifully heartbreaking performance by Carol Kane and the sassy and commanding performance by Dorrie Kavanaugh (as the other woman) and you have a beautiful showcase of talent that stands tall as one of the unexpected gems of cinema.  This is a treasure of a film about Russian Jews immigrating to America during the late 1800's.  It is beautifully sincere and sharp.  I'll never get the category placement back in the 70's (this was considered a comedy, which it CLEARLY is not).  This is a dramatic and sincere portrayal of real people living out real lives.  I highly recommend this!",N/A

1360273,"I am a fan of both SEINFELD and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM and thus really enjoy both Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David.  Over the years I have come to enjoy Larry even more than Jerry as Larry is willing to take his comedy further.  It is tempting therefore to instantly compare Louie C.K. to both comics and his show to theirs.  And, above all, to compare all three to the early Woody Allen, who carved out his early career in tv, standup and comic movies.The hugest difference right off the bat is that Louie is NOT JEWISH. If you are fans of the other three, this is a HUGE difference because the other three derive a lot of their comedy from being part of the Jewish American culture set in New York City.  Louie also is a single father with joint custody who takes care of his two daughters half of every week in a very hands on way.  No one can picture the other three doing anything of the sort.Yet there is still a striking similarity and I think it is to do with all of them train a macroscopic lens on their personal lives with their comedy. No detail of making it through the day intact is left uncovered by any of them. Another similarity is that they are all disasters with women in their comedic personas.If you are a fan of Jerry and Larry, you need to immerse yourself in several episodes of Louie to quiet your tendency to expect it to be SEINFELD or CURB.  By about the third or fourth episode, you are totally into Louie C.K. and are no longer comparing him to Jerry and Larry.  I loved the comic stylings of Louie C.K. and his examination of his world.",N/A

271211,"Came across the original Gremlins film a couple of months ago, watched it for the first time since a kid and realised I'd forgotten just how good a horror film that was.  I had seen the sequel in cinemas with a group of fellow first year of high school mates when it came out.  I remembered some of the gremlin characters such as Brain and Flasher gremlin and that I liked it but I did wonder if it would be that great now that I'm more than 20 years older, as some 80s/90s movies I watched as kid such as Goonies really don't stack up to my romanticised memory when watching today.  However I'm pleased to say Gremlins 2 The New Batch was absolutely brilliant! It was funny, the Gremlins themselves, although at times you could tell were puppets, still look brilliant. I think the fact you can tell they are puppets helps it to be such a watchable for younger kids as well as older ones and adults film. I've actually bought a few figures by NECA because I liked these characters so much.Gremlins 2 if you haven't seen it is a totally different type of film to the original. The original was a horror film with funny moments every now and then.  Not sure if it was marketed as a kids' films but we were a less wussified generation back then, and everyone watched it.  I think the creators knew this sequel would be watched by kids so it's deliberately made to be a lot more fun, it's the reversal of the original, now being a comedy film with small snippets of horror.  The new batch is not as dark a film with less horror and smaller human body count, with most people who die in this one simply just disappearing with the next human character just appearing at the location wondering where they are.  It's a really fun film, the fact that there's a research lab tenant in the highrise building allowed the writers to come up with some really great mutation Gremlins such as the super intelligent Brain, the bat gremlin, the gremlin with vegetables growing from its head, one that grows a spider's body and heaps of others.  Plus you've got the usual simply mischievous ones such as one in a trench coat that flashes its reptilian body which is funny since gremlins unless they find something to wear are always nude anyway.Unlike a lot of sequels this film stands in its own right.  There's talk of another Gremlins film possibly in the works.  I loved the first two and would love to see a third but only if it's done properly and is as good as the first two.  Terminator 3 and a heap of other films who had a good initial film and sequel but terrible ones to follow have proven that you need a good script too.  I hope they stick with the hand and robotic puppets for the mogwai and gremlin characters and don't just go for the latest fad of CGI as that would take a lot of the fun out of it.  The Muppets didn't ditch the puppet formula with their new modern movie and neither should Gremlins if they chose to make a third one.  There are also some nice bonus features such as deleted scenes (with or without commentary), commentary accompanying the movie if you wish, the trailer, a behind the scenes featurette as well as gag real.  There are also subtitles for the hard of hearing or those for who English is a second language there's a few other subtitle options too.A brilliantly done movie and DVD package, I have no regrets buying this and you'll have plenty of friends and work colleagues asking to borrow it.",N/A
1553,"I don't know why amazon.com clumps reviews together, it's very damaging to those who want to get a idea about a film. So  on here we  have lots of reviews about the documentary film mixed with reviews about the tnt movie starring  Cuba Golding. I am reviewing the film; which is as inpiring and true as the temple grandin movie from HBo. The story concerns Ben Carson who rose from the most diffilcult of situations to become one of the world's greatest neurosurgeons. I have seen this movie at least four times and it never ceases to inspire me. It also points out the importance of parenting , studying of finding the right friends and many other things. The acting here is emmy worthy from everyone involved. The actress who plays the mother was so outstanding that I forgot that she wasn't really her character. It's a complex role and a important one too. It shows how she escapes her past and helps her children to become something great. Her husband, a drug user is not seen but all to often that is the plague that lays waste to families in this country.  Cuba Golding is at his very best here as Ben Carson. And the child actors are really  believable too they seem to really be Ben and the transition to adult Ben is smooth. This is a movie that everyone should see and especially minority kids whose only role models are often lame rappers.  Everything about this movie , from it's acting to direction is well done.

1402855,"There was little doubt that there would be a sequel to the hit 2009 comedy about a group of friends trying to put together the pieces of an alcohol soaked night in Las Vegas. Hollywood is first and foremost a business and no one is going to pass up the opportunity to squeeze more money out of a popular commodity. What's so frustrating about The Hangover Part II is the complete lack of anything resembling creativity or originality on the part of everyone involved. This movie is one of the most blatant examples of ""phoning it in"" that I have ever seen.The plot is an exact replica of the first film. Once again the wolf pack (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galafranakas) find themselves hung-over after a wild night of partying (this time in Thailand) and working to figure out what happened. I could spend more time discussing the plot, but if you've seen the first film, then you've seen this one. The jokes are essentially the same, but the laughs are few and far between. The movie does seem to be striving to be cruder than the first, but it falls flat in that respect as well. Even the cast doesn't seem to be having as much fun this time around.If you saw the first movie, skip this one since it is merely a faded copy of the much funnier original.

Their second mistake was in making Rusty positively chatty this time out (different voice, dopey chuckle, it didn't inspire terror it made me laugh).

412712,"This little gem is my favorite Halloween movie (I even told John Carpenter this when I met him in 2011). The spirit of Halloween, the reality of evil and the fear of new technology are merged into a moody, atmospheric thriller. In my humble opinion, Tom Atkins' best role as Dr. Challis (I used the name for a character in my second novel as tribute) and he pulls off one of the best disillusioned doctors in celluloid history (makes Dr. McCoy from Star Trek look like the Easter Bunny); Dan O' Herlihy (The Old Man from Robocop and the eerie prophet from Insavion USA-1952) is incredibly sinister as Conal Cochran, the mad, Celtic witch/toy maker planning to kill off our population with Halloween masks that shoot a magickal laser beam into your head and produces a hodge-podge of critters in your skull; not even Vincent Price could have done better; Stacy Nelligan is one of those sweet/sexy actresses that appeared in a few movies back in the 1980's and then vaporized.The synthesizer Carpenter score is some of the best he ever created and is iconic; the annoying little ""Silver Shamrock"" tune is easily recongized and either makes you sing along or cringe, depending on your feelings for the whole matter.Stuntman Dick Warlock (Michael Myers from Halloween II-1981) plays one of the cyborgs; he's the one that pulls the old man's face apart and then sets himself on fire at the end of the first act; we see him several more times throughout the movie and he even gets his wirey guts pulled out in one scene, courtesy of Dr. Challis.Scenes from the original Halloween (1978) can be seen on a televison screen late in the movie when Conal Cochran places a skull mask on Dr. Challis' head in hopes that the laser beam in the back of the mask will put paid to our poor hero.The scenes of snakes and bugs coming out of the head of the dead boy in the test room sequence harken back to the nursery ryme, What Are Little Boys Made Of? and a subtle, grotesque reminder of a witch's brew. Nasty to behold? Yeah, but very cool.The Blue Stones stolen from Stonehenge get very little play in the movie, but receive lots of detail in the novelization.Now about the girl (Stacy Nelligan) whom Dr. Challis rescues only to discover that she's a cyborg, too. Was she always a cyborg or did we leave the real girl back at the Silver Shamrock factory? We will never know for sure.Nandy Loomis (Annie from the original Halloween) plays Dr. Challis' harpy of an ex-wife.Nightfall seems to cover every city in North America at the same time, regardless of time zones, during the montage sequence where we hear the entire track of the Silver Shamrock tune; a span of a minute and a half.In the novelization the ntire manuscript was written in first person from Dr. Challis' perspective, and entire gross-out scenes are missing.John Carpenter did not want to turn Halloween into a continuous franchise vehicle for Michael Myers the way Hammer did for Frankenstein and Dracula, and originally planned to do different Halloween terror tales in each consecutive movie, but the public didn't agree so Halloween died for six years until Trancas International resurrected the franchise with Michael Myers' return in 1988.This is one of the top ten of my favorite horror movies.",Halloween 3 - Season of the Witch VHS

508911,"The courtroom can often be a place of high drama in cinema (think: A Few Good Men).  In ""The Paradine Case"", however, there just isn't enough compelling material to make its ""verdict"" a success.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Mrs. Paradine (Alida Valli), an English women accused of murdering her husband.  When lawyer Anthony Keane (Gregory Peck) is called onto the case and falls for the widow in an instant, however, his ethical responsibilities to the bench are pulled to the fraying point.The number one problem with this movie is that the plot is terribly predictable.  I won't give away any details here, but there are enough hints and innuendos given throughout the film that the verdict that should have been ""shocking"" at the film's climax is rendered relatively inert.  Perhaps such film-making tactics were commonplace in the 1940s and easier for audiences to digest, but more seasoned film fans will find it annoying that nothing in this movie is ever questioned or rendered remotely suspenseful.The other problem with ""Paradine"" is the whole ""love at first sight"" angle between Peck's character and the lead female role.  This is a flimsy plot contrivance that should have been delved into more deeply instead of just accepted in the blink of an eye.  While watching, I wanted to know more about that main relationship, but instead we are just supposed to buy-in from the get-go and, again, not question a thing.About the only redeeming value in this film for me was that the ethical struggles are indeed endearing and important to the law profession.  Those are the issues that the film should have focused on instead of spending so much time on a romance angle that viewers can see will not be surprising in the least come conclusion time.Thus, this is one of Hitch's poorer efforts in my book.  It may be slightly (2.5 stars would be my perfect rating) better than his Cold War stinkers, but lags far behind his thoughtful, suspenseful fare.  Skip this one if you are not a Hitch nut.",N/A

The attention to detail shown, in going back to the original film elements show throughout the episodes included here, is more than rewarded by the results! As a viewer who loved the Next Generation, but always HATED the image quality of the show, even back during it's first run, when we were all watching on standard resolution CRT TVs (which should have hidden some of the sins of the editing process. The show was shot on film, but edited on (apparently poor) video).For the first time (outside the feature films), we have the Enterprise-D looking sharp and detailed, against an inky black starscape. The actors and sets no longer look fuzzy and ill defined, and the new 7.1 surround mix works wonderfully (immersive, without being in your face enough to force you to pay special attention to it's upgrade, drawing you out of the show.)The only real question for TNG fans is obviously, do you NEED this release at all, when the complete Season 1 complete boxed set will be out later this year, and the plan is two seasons a year being produced in 2013 on. For myself, I'd say it's worth the 15 bucks or so just to check out what was done on an HD bigscreen.

His co-owner wife, Grace (Sally Burgess) is played by the classy Helen Mirren. They had owned illegal brothels, which appears to have been easier than the headaches associated with legal ones and having to deal with ""25 psychotics,"" as Grace puts it.The movie captured the bikini clad girls of the era. There is brief nudity and sexual situations as one would expect from such a movie, but it is minimal considering the topic. Of course Pesci drops the f-bomb like only Pesci can. The movie failed to capture the frequent celebrity appearances at the ranch. Rather it focuses on the year 1976. Grace finds out she has cancer and maybe six months to live. She tries to tell Charlie, who is too busy with the talent. Charlie gets an idea for Argentinian boxer Bruza (Oscar Bonavena) to train at the ranch to attract clients. While at the ranch Bruza and Grace have an affair. The movie is based on a true story and did a fair job in following it. The closing dialogue of the movie implies that the ranch's tax problems came shortly after the shooting of Bruza in 1976. That is not true. It wasn't until 1990 that the IRS took over the Ranch and Joe Conforte fled to Brazil. The Mustang II ranch shown at the end of the movie was erected in 1982.",N/A

243628,"Fellini's great story about a director who has producers, actors, critics, the press and assorted others hanging in the balance while he plans his next film.  Everyone is getting ready to film and the actors are all present but the character played by Marcello Mastroianni doesn't have a story much less a script.  He confronts his wife, his girlfriends, friends and others who are hanging on his every whim and desire for employment and success.  Only with his leading actress, Claudia Cardinale can he let his guard down and allow her to be in the driver's seat (literally).  The others cling to him as he tries to run away and not be bothered in order to think.  The idea comes to him at the last moment before production has shut down and in the face of a staunch critic who tells him that he was right not to try rather than to risk failure.  The effort of creativity, fear of its loss and the vision others have of the artist which can be positive or toxic to artistic talent is a large theme in this movie.

A young Indian man/chef in Manhattan named Samir (Aasif Mandvi, who also co-wrote the script), a bit of a hot-head who quits his job when passed over for a promotion, is forced to give up his plans to relocate to Paris to study the culinary arts when his father suffers a heart attack ... and Samir has to take over the family's restaurant.  The problem?  Samir has never cooked an Indian dish, and indeed has never had the slightest bit of interest in either the food of his culture OR his father's tiny little restaurant.  A chance meeting with an Indian cab driver changes everything, and through food Samir finds his zest for both life and his culture all over again.

553946,"I myself was touring most of the surviving fighter bases as well as the air museums of Great Britain just before the series ""Piece of Cake"" was aired on TV in the U.K. I was so happy to see this series offered by Amazon.com as I had really wrote it off of ever watching it let alone being able to obtain my own copy. For the purist & authentic history buff it has many things wrong. For instance during that time period the RAF flew Hawker Hurricane fighter A/C as in the movie the  Battle of Britain during the beginning of that movie Hurricanes were accurately used in France during that time period not Spitfires. If I remember correctly when Piece of Cake was produced there may have been only 3 or 4 Hurricanes airworthy in the world actually flying so there was no way they could have acquired a sufficient quantity of Hurricanes to make the movie factual according to history thus we put up with an inaccuracy but got to watch  view & hear what I & many consider to be the finest single/seat fighter & dog-fighter ever produced by any A/C company. One little thing I observed which was true to fact: Just watch on some of the take/offs, you'll notice the Spitfires as they take off retracting their under-carriage wiggle a bit as if the pilot is being very sloppy in his take/off procedure but I think for authenticity they were instructed to do so as in a Spitfire as you went to raise your undercarriage you had to move your left hand from the throttle to grasp the control yoke (stick) & grab the under-carriage lever with your right hand to operate the under-cart lever thus making a shaking movement in your flying attitude which was quite noticeable from the ground just like in the movie, now that's authentic ! Like Steve Hinton once said:""The Spitfire is like a little guy with great big muscles""! Again , even after they returned back to England from France as the Battle of Britain began they would have been flying early models & marks of Spitfires not Mark 9's with 4-blade props , dual under-wing coolers & gun sights with square reflector plates (Lenses), although you do get a view of one early model "" Spit "" with a single under-wing cooler making a few passes.(S/N AR501 maybe?) I suppose I do get a bit critical on facts & another thing I noticed near the end of the movie was on starting up the engines on two Spitfires the propellers were spinning the wrong direction and these A/C were not late model Rolls Royce Griffon powered they were Rolls Royce Merlin powered as noted by the close fitted cowlings. Could it be the film was inadvertently inserted in the studio projector somehow crossed up & nobody caught this ? BUT on to the movie , all inaccuracies forgiven ! If you are a Spitfire addict this movie is for you. The cast of characters and their roles portrayed are priceless. No heroes outshining each-other but actually the way it was , a battle hardened squadron of pilots not knowing if it was their turn to get the ""Chop"" next time up, putting up with non-experienced pilots fresh out of training, political differences , going round the bend ready to lose their minds but never the less ready to fight & pilot officer "" Moggy "", who would have ever thought ? A tiny bit of a love story , a tiny bit of reckless flying , it's all here but most of all actual Spitfires doing their thing not sitting in museums. Of course we can forgive the appearances of Spanish built HA112's with Rolls Royce Merlin power portraying German built ME109's(BF) but after all I don't think there was one genuine German 109 flying in the world at the time this series was produced. As a pilot & history buff even with this movie's inaccuracy to fact I believe this is one of the finest aviation movies (series) ever produced ! DEFINITELY FIVE STARS",N/A

1211072,"This isn't bad for a summer big action film. It has a good fast pace, a simple story and a sense of humor about itself. The action is very creative and, as expected, Robert Downey Jr steals the show. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job in a rather subdued role. The Harry Dean Stanton cameo was very well done and shows that he still has it as a character actor.The bits with Scarlett Johansson were creative and fun. They turned the usual ""weak hero getting lectured by the villian"" bit on its head. That sort of thing is the best method for putting a heroic character over in a film. The villian gets his bluster lines, but then is shown to have been outsmarted and ends up looking foolish. Few films (for decades) have managed to get that simple thing right. The actors playing Thor and Captain America also did a good job. The bit with Loki in Europe established the Captain America character in a good way in a short amount of film time and avoided what could have been the annoying aspects of a lecturing patriotic character. Thor was all about the action as it should have been. They managed to figure out a way to make the Hawkeye character (an archer) actually work. The bits with the bow as a close-up weapon were a great idea.The things that don't work so well:Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury however doesn't work. There is too much of him and I dont know that using him to bring the group together in the story was necessary. It would have been better for him to be more incidental than constantly at the core of things. The whole the-government-can't-be-trusted subplot was a predictable waste of time.They spent too much time with followup characters from previous films. It didn't add much of anything really.The alien invasion characters were all rather bland and cookie cutter looking. Making everything grey chrome and mostly identical was a rather odd choice. It got to a point where it seemed like there were two CGI models that they just kept using over and over again. It might have been better to give some of the aliens more of a personality rather than having them be bugs squashed one after the other.Five stars within its genre.

1341611,"Lionsgate's Easter blockbuster is a lengthy, high-octane dramatisation ofThe Hunger Games, a ""young adult"" novel by Suzanne Collins. It is the first in a series about which I'd heard nothing before this screening. My eleven-year-old son tells me it is quite the thing at the moment. He's read the whole series and was mightily aggrieved to find out that his square old Dad was going to see it and not someone more fully deserving, like himself.Life's like that, son - which is more or less the starting premise of the screenplay. The Hunger Games skips nimbly from the heroic quest via a cutting social satire - our vacuous TV lives are mocked in the style of Neil Postman'sAmusing Ourselves to Death- to a pretty blunt commentary on contemporary geopolitics (the backdrop is a close simile for the Arab Spring), without ever forgetting the momentum and pulse of a great story. Director Gary Ross easily could have laid on the sanctimony too thickly but his touch was light and the picture was the more effective for it.The premise is simple: post apocalypse, there is a ruling clique in the Capitol. They live contented if empty lives by exploiting the plebian ghettoes surrounding their city. As punishment for a long distant uprising, each year two dozen proletariat children are picked out from these ""districts"" to fight to the death for the titillation of the Capitol's chattering classes.Here you'll surmise, correctly, that the story is heavily derivative, but of so many things it blurs. There are shades of1984,Mad Max,Blade Runner,King Arthur,The Running Man,Lost,The Fifth Element,The Truman Show, Avatar, Total Wipeout and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here. There were no straight rip-offs, but it was difficult to say the film was any meaningful way novel.But it was executed with plenty of style, with much frenetic use of steadycam. I was sitting in the second row, cowed before a football-field sized screen. I had real trouble keeping the whole thing in focus. The jumpier scenes faded in and out dizzily and it was hard to take in without getting a headache.Nonetheless Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, looking not a million miles from a ninja Laura Ingalls), dominates the screen and has more than enough presence to carry the drama. She musters chemistry with pretty much every character on the set except Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her notional romantic interest, who is a fellow combatant she must, in theory, kill if she is to survive. Hutcherson is badly miscast as a beta-male gladiator, and was in any case asked to play the most conflicted of all the characters. We suspect Katmiss pined instead for lantern-jawed Gale (Liam Hemsworth) an under-explained hunk, or an effete Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) - anyone, in fact, other than Peeta. Even Donald Sutherland's President Snow.For a long film with a long build-up, the background exposition was rushed. The tragic history of the Everdeen family was really only hinted at. Katniss' mother (Paula Malcolmson) is emotionally unstable in ways that aren't explained, and is scripted only moon-faced stares to convey her inner conflict. Partly, there are too many characters doing not enough each to make for a tight backstory. Some economising on roles would have helped a good deal.Still, the film works surprisingly well. The drama struck me, at first, of being a little pat (a rap on TV Reality Gameshows, suggesting contestants really are gladiatorial victims self-wounding for the titillation of the great unwashed) but as it developed the heroic aspect resonated more clearly with more recent geopolitical unrest. Wikipedia reveals that Collins' inspiration came to her when channel surfing between reality TV and CNN's coverage of the invasion of Iraq. This has been cannily updated in terms of the Arab Spring, and in particular the current situation in Syria.""Give them hope,"" mutters Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley), another otiose character in a film full of them, ""but not too much hope.""At which point one must mention a splendid turn from Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) providing comic relief and vital plot exposition, at least until he resorted to parachuting lines of his script into the rest of the cast rather than saying them (you think I'm exaggerating, don't you).Through some convenient contrivances the seemingly inevitable downbeat ending was avoided, and resolute stares from all assembled at what was a rather unfulfilling conclusion suggest strongly that more episodes from Collins' series are planned.This is a well executed film which is well shot, well scripted, well edited and well paced - although it was a good twenty minutes longer than it needed to be.Olly BuxtonFlickfeast",N/A
1496936,"The ""Based on a True Story"" hook of PUNCTURE wears its welcome not too long after the first act, but it's a powerful punch of a first act. In essence, this is the tale of the small Houston personal injury law firm Danzinger and Weiss who, on behalf of a nurse dying of AIDS from an accidental needle stick, take on Big Medical and their vast monopoly over the products they produce. It's a pretty predictable tale all around from anyone who's seen pretty much any legal drama ever. The characters are pretty stock as well as the plot. We have longtime character actor Marshall Bell (from just about every film you've seen since the mid-80's) as the grizzled, ornery designer of the live-saving safety needles; Brett Cullen (most recently seen on PERSON OF INTEREST) as the slick-as-a-snake big-time defense attorney; Mark Kassen (the film's co-director, with his brother Adam) as Paul Danzinger, the responsible, practical and harried partner; Vinessa Shaw (perhaps best known for her role as ""Domino"" in Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT) as the dying nurse that kickstarts the film's tale and Michael Biehn as the shadowy and mysterious man that seems to be pursuing the protagonists, who we don't know is friend or foe. Doesn't sound very original, does it?That's until you factor in Chris Evans as Mike Weiss, the other half of the firm. Weiss is a pretty serious drug addict as we see very early on in the film. In a dynamic introduction to his character, he's been on a bender of cocaine in a dumpy motel room and is preparing questions for a witness and practices on another user. As we also see early on, Weiss has a very unusual lifestyle (he keeps an alligator in a wading pool; he drinks health-nut juices like wheat grass while constantly abusing his body with cocaine, an assortment of pills, heroin, etc.) and is rapidly heading for a divorce presumably due to his constant affairs and his rampant drug use. But when he meets Shaw's character and sees what is going on in the medical supply industry, it becomes less about the kind of ambulance-chasing law they've been doing and more about starting something on a possibly global scale. This, of course, awakens something perhaps long dormant within him about what being a lawyer is really about.Evans, despite his more recent star-turns as Captain America, is a consumate actor who really gives Weiss a sense of perpetual mania; when he's in motion, he is almost hyperkinetic, but when he crashes, he crashes hard. There's rarely a moment in the film where his character hits a false note, and the story is infinitely more interesting when he's on screen. As charming and energetic as Evans is, he shows a deeply vulnerable side that he rarely gets a chance to show when he isn't busy commanding superheroes.The film does a commendable yet all-too-predictable job of showing how hard it is for a small law firm to take on a large cabal of evil corporations and their machinations and influence over other businesses, the government, and perhaps even life itself as the film's climax is met with echoes of the great Meryl Streep film SILKWOOD. All of the performances, while rote, are effective with the exception of Mark Kassen, who just seems a little out of his depth here. The film is directed with some style but the film doesn't want to take too many risks by making Weiss out to be a bad guy, or to explore the darker sides of his life in too much depth, which is sad because the film is almost clone-like in its ERIN BROCKOVICH construction and it could benefit by bringing something much more unusual to the table that really sets it apart.Aside from Evans' performance, PUNCTURE is a take-it-or-leave-it legal drama that has moments that stay with you, but unfortunately, they're too few and far between.",Puncture

712788,"This will not be numbered among the better films made by Sidney Poitier(director), Gene Wilder (star) nor Richard Widmark (supporting actor), all of whom have been involved with superior films, but will provide a solid base for an evenings entertainment. The plot is of the genre in which Bob Hope, Danny Kaye, Red Skelton, Gene Wilder, himself, and many others before and since, have made excellent use for laughs, the spy thriller comedy. I don't know that I would call them a spoof on the serious film since,often, they do have their own brand of suspense and ""thrills""; but they can be very funny indeed. In  this case, the writers have relied far too much on some of Wilder's trademarked vocal emissions and far too little on his ability to deliver comedy lines and gestures. In fact, it is as difficult to find a funny line in the film as it is to find a novel plot device. Wilder does as well as could be expected under the circumstances, which, for me, was the major source of fun though not laughs. Gilda Radner was completely wasted, given no opportunity to do more than any third rate actress could have equaled. Richard Widmark is menacing early on, but becomes wooden as the dialogue and action descend to Perils of Pauline levels. There are a number of other highly capable actors who sink under the weight of the script. Yet, perhaps it is only my affection both for Wilder and for the genre, I did find it entertaining and would recommend it to any viewer who can approach it with modest expectations and view it in the same spirit as one would an extended TV comedy skit.",N/A

1374863,"""Hugo"" is a drama genre film where the calamity of several lives intermingles with each other, at the Paris Railway Station of Gare Montparnasse.The narrative follows Hugo Cabret, an orphan boy, who is fending for himself whilst maintaining all the clocks at the train station, and living in the servicing areas.It is a broken automaton that brings many of the film characters together. After the death of his father Hugo believes that returning the automaton back to working order, which has a writing function, will contain a message from his dad, and he works tirelessly to achieve this.The automaton connects more than one broken heart and Hugo's comment that: ""machines don't come with spare parts...so as humans we have to assume that there are no spare parts in our world, and that we all have a purpose,"" is striking as philosophically poignant film dialogue.The viewer is presented with a stupendously crafted story, complemented by wonderful acting, and accompanied by breathtaking film shot selection and vivid colour.Nicholas R.W.

1509653,"It's a very slick & well-made film, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief. Perhaps I wasn't supposed to. I just didn't get the relationships: who is the girl in love with, anyway? What was she doing with that screw-up husband Standard in the first place? I guess she's just attracted to those antisocial personality disorder types...The acting was fantastic: I'm a huge fan of Gosling, and his emotional range and depth in this movie was as impressive as ever. What bothers me--and this is my personal bugaboo--is the Hollywood idealization of this kind of ""bad guy"": he is a  sociopath with a heart of gold and a soft spot for fatherless kids. I just don't buy it.",N/A
1265994,"This is a movie about acceptance. The protagonist was a cellist, and lost his job in a symphony at the city. He went home to his birthplace, a small town, and accepted a job as a person that prepared the dead (put clothes and make-up) for burial. Its a thankless job that the Japanese society disdains. Though the job paid well, the antagonist felt ashamed and had to hide his job from his wife and his childhood friends which in turn generated plenty of comic and tragic situations. In seeking resolution to his childhood and new dilemmas, the protagoist finally received the ultimate enlightment by preparing his long-lost deceased father for burial. This is a very well-done movie, it trancends all cultural boundaries because who hasn't in life that hasn't seek understanding and acceptance from our fellowmen for our own thoughts and actions. This is the reason why it received the BEST FOREIGN PICTURE OF THE YEAR at the 2008 Oscar.",N/A
1505549,"Never having heard of ""Sinners and Saints,"" I can honestly say that my expectations were appropriately grounded. Perhaps that's why the film came as such a pleasant surprise. It's certainly not the best, most professional, or most original movie that you'll see this year--but it works and that's the most important thing. It aims to be exciting and entertaining, and it succeeds at those modest goals without being insultingly idiotic! That's where so many straight-to-DVD endeavors go wrong, they oftentimes miss the point of having a coherent and reasonable screenplay. ""Sinners and Saints"" is an old school police actioner that has a satisfyingly high body count, a twisty narrative, and likable protagonists. It has plenty of shoot-outs, some gleefully unpleasant torture scenes, and plenty of fisticuffs tied together by an interesting story set in the dilapidated venues of post-Katrina New Orleans.When a series of grisly murders attract the attention of the NOPD brass, a hot-headed but street smart cop (Johnny Strong) is assigned to help the homicide detectives. The deaths appear to be linked to a powerful criminal enterprise, and Strong may have unexpected ties to the murders. His childhood friend (Sean Patrick Flanery) seems to be neck deep in the trouble. The cops spend most of the film trying to track down Flanery to discover just what is motivating this killing spree. Along the way, they become a target themselves and many scenes just end with a ridiculous amount of gunfire. The actual motives really don't matter that much, they just serve as a catalyst to initiate the violence and mayhem. And the action sequences are orchestrated with precision with a good mix of excitement, danger, and over-the-top fun.The movie certainly has its flaws and moments that strain credulity, but I liked it well enough to just go with the flow. Perhaps the biggest plot oversight involves the power player behind the criminal enterprise played by Jurgen Prochnow. The film ends with his story dangling in the wind, unresolved, and never to be mentioned again. I did love the endless supply of machine gun toting henchman that were available throughout the picture, the fact that the ending confrontation didn't arouse the interest of police or any passing cars, and the fact that a major character just showed up randomly at the same confrontation. But despite the expected silliness, the film still kept me involved. I give most of that credit to its lead actor, Johnny Strong. I'm not familiar with Strong, but if this is any indication--I expect I might be seeing him again. Credible as both an action star and in moments that required more character complexity, this guy should have a career. ""Sinners and Saints,"" at the end of the day, may not necessarily be a great movie but it is an effective and enjoyable one. It has relatively modest ambitions, and it succeeds at being the movie that it wants to be. KGHarris, 12/11.",N/A
830674,"This movie wasn't flashy and didn't involve a lot of scenery.  It was more one of those films that have you discussing things after it's over.  Fans of Babylon 5 will love Jason Carter as the vampire (he seems to be doing a lot in this genre of late).  It could be considered slow, but in this ADD world I find that a bit refreshing.  The situation felt fairly realistic and some of the movie, dialog, and general concepts were just terrific.So why only 3 stars?  Well, despite some great acting on the part of some of the players the talent was not universally shared amongst the cast.  Some were really stiff, or just plain failed at conveying their characters.  It is something when a bit part prostitute outshines several of the main actors. (very minor spoiler alert) Further the downward spiral of the main doc wasn't believable in my opinion, and neither was the final plot device designed to create the climax.  I also wasn't sure about the vampire's (Jason Carter) motivation, though I suppose some of that was the point.  Still they even mentioned during one scene in the film that if the 1000 year old vampire had been killing people like he had recently, it would have raised more flags, so maybe he wasn't the real killer.  That begs the question, why wasn't the brutal Vlad murders noticed before now?  Did the vampire escalate all of a sudden for some reason?  Did he just stop trying to hide his kills?  And if he can survive on transfused blood, why all the killing in the first place from an otherwise very sophisticated, inquisitive, and otherwise not malicious individual?Despite the negatives, I was still entertained for the full length of the film.  I just wouldn't watch it while very tired or you many not make the ending.",Demon Under Glass

434963,"Directed by Andrew McLaglen (McLintock!, The Wild Geese,The Devil's Brigade) Mitchell (1975), stars Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall) as a tough police detective named Mitchell, who operates by his own set of rules.  While not a classic in the genre, Mitchell is a serviceable enough crime drama, with a decent story, and a pretty good cast.  The action sequences are well done, and include a couple of car chases, and a helicopter pursuing a boat.Mitchell is working on two cases, one involves a wealthy lawyer named Deaney (John Saxon) who gunned down a burglar in his home, and then planted a weapon on the body, to make it appear to be self defense.  Aware that Mitchell suspects him of murder, Deaney tries to buy him off, and also sends a prostitute named Greta (Linda Evans) to Mitchell's apartment.  The cop has no problem with sleeping with her, and later carting her off to jail, for possession of drugs.Mitchell's primary assignment is to observe James Arthur Cummings (Martin Balsam), a man with underworld ties who is suspected of being involved in the importation of a large shipment of drugs.  Eventually both Deaney and Cummings, make attempts to kill Mitchell, but the detective proves to be more plucky and resourceful that he might appear.  Andrew McLaglen is very capable directing action, and after meandering along the film finishes strongly with a gunfight followed by a terrific action sequence, featuring a helicopter chasing a boat out at sea, and then attacking it, using a metal tank as a wrecking ball.  Mitchell displays his fighting skills, wrapping up the case.This is a straight ahead drama without a lot of mystery, as the bad guys are revealed at the start, and know that Mitchell is after them.  With his winning personality and aggressive style, it's not long before Mitchell is breaking and entering, shattering bones, shooting unarmed suspects, and going caveman, bashing in a man's head with a rock.Detectives with quirky personalities are nothing new, but Mitchell is still an unusual guy.  He can be hard and tough, and also rather unsophisticated and crude.  He sometimes plays the fool, although he usually has some idea of what he is doing.  Although immune to monetary bribes, he's perfectly willing to enjoy Greta's charms, while remaining quite detached emotionally.  Mitchell is kind of a jerk, and has a cruel streak, but he also has the resourcefulness and drive to see things through to the end.  Joe Don Baker may occasionally play things a little too cute, but it's still a pretty interesting if uneven performance.Given the story, the acting is not too bad.  John Saxon (Enter the Dragon]]) is good as a scheming crook, and Linda Evans (Big Valley, Dynasty TV series) brings some class to a rather thankless role.  Martin Balsam (Psycho,The Anderson Tapes) is fine, but someone younger and more capable of displaying ruthlessness and toughness, might have worked better.  In an early film appearance, football player turned actor Merlin Olsen (Father Murphy), is a little stiff, but not too bad as Cummings' bodyguard.The film's country music influenced soundtrack, and Mitchell's theme, sung by Hoyt Axton, is very reminiscent of Mike Post's work on The Rockford Files (1974-80).  If you like 70's crime dramas with offbeat detectives, Mitchell is a decent watch.  Some other movies in this genre, from around the same time period, would includeBullitt(1968), Marlowe (1969),Dirty Harry(1971), The French Connection (1971),Shamus(1973),The Laughing Policeman(1973),The Drowning Pool(1975), andSt. Ives(1976).",Mitchell VHS
1416759,"The genre of film known as ""sword and sandal"" has gone up and down over the years. A staple of films in the late 50s and early 60s the genre lost favor when the age of the anti-hero and film student film makers took over. But in 2000 that changed when GLADIATOR hit the screens and planted Russell Crowe firmly in the position of movie star. More movies followed like TROY and 300. And so it is we now have the latest film based on Greek mythology, IMMORTALS.The story opens by telling us the history of the Gods of Greece, having risen up against the Titans and imprisoning them in Mount Tartarus. The only weapon on Earth that could possibly free the Titans and thus open the world to a war among Gods once more is the Epirus bow, now being sought by King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke).As the army of Hyperion moves forward in search of the bow, villages fall and inhabitants try to stay one step ahead avoiding capture. Young Theseus (Henry Cavill) is a highly skilled warrior trained by an old man in his village (John Hurt). But since his birth was the result of his mother being raped, both are looked down upon and when the time comes to leave they are left behind. This results in Theseus' mother's death when the village is attacked by Hyperion's men and Theseus is captured.While this is going on Hyperion has captured the oracle Phaedra in hopes that she will lead him to the bow he seeks. But it is visions of Theseus that fill her head and she knows that he is the key to stopping Hyperion. When their paths cross Theseus helps leads a revolt against the few guards that hold them prisoner organized by Phaedra and with the help of a thief named Stavros (Stephen Dorff) they set out to bury his mother in his home village.While in the village they discover that the Epirus bow was buried there all along. Theseus recovers the bow but is attacked by Hyperion's beast the Minotaur. Theseus survives and knows his destiny lies in stopping Hyperion. They travel to Phaedra's home only to be overtaken by Hyperion's men and losing the bow. Now it's up to Theseus to join the army that stands against Hyperion and prevent the release of the Titans. And this is just the main story going on here.Along the way Theseus and Phaedra fall in love, politicians fall for Hyperion's tricks and nearly cause the downfall of the civilized world and the Gods speak to Theseus. It seems that the person who trained him was Zeus posing as the old man. Having already told the rest of the Gods that they are not to interfere, he tells Theseus that the Gods can not assist man; they must shine on their own. These were the rules written long ago when the Titans were first imprisoned.Of course this all means that we're bound to see a major battle scene involving the good army against the bad one, a face off between Theseus and Hyperion and the possibility of the release of the Titans if Theseus doesn't quite take care of things. And should they be released, a battle among Gods will surely follow.The movie offers the tale of a hero extremely well and perhaps it's time we told stories of heroes once again. It seems there we find few out there these days in the spotlight and so many are toppled from their pedestals by those who feel we need more truth and less heroes. Myself I'm glad we have heroes to inspire us even if they are in movies and stories only.The special effects are dazzling to watch and fit nicely into the story rather than take it over. Battle scenes are bloody but they would have been since they involved more bludgeoning and blades than anything else. But at least those involved have that gritty look to them as opposed to the freshly starched togas seen in some films.The acting done by all shines here, especially Cavill. That's great to see since he's been tapped to portray Superman in the new film being made. He has the presence to carry that role off which many were concerned about when he was named. If he can make you believe he's the Grecian hero seen here then Superman should be a breeze.The movies being turned out in this genre have all been exceptional and well worth our time as a viewing audience. Many have been worth adding to our collections, including this one. Let's just hope they continue to make them and then discover that the past treasures deserve blu-ray treatment as well. For now we'll have to be content watching releases like IMMORTALS which offer tremendous entertainment.",N/A

1289334,"Don't listen to the naysayers. This is a brilliant re imaging of Patrick McGoohan's great series updated to these more complicated times. I often wondered what would happen if the original PRISONER took place today and this is it. This is much more sublime and goes much deeper then McGoohan's. In some respects, McGoohan's series, as good as it is, now seems a little dated, almost but not quite, a parody of itself,like watching AUSTIN POWERS. And McGoohan, by his own admission,never had a clear vision of an ending. Instead, he just made the last episode and left town with a lot of unanswered questions. This version, however, is much more thought out. But, you have to give it some thought, which is the idea. If you watch this and get bored, then go back to McGoohan's fine series with it's psychedelic aspect and relive your youth during the turbulent 60's. That's fine. But if you want to see those very same aspects depicted in today's much more dangerous world, then this is for you. But watch it to understand it, not to compare it. Also, with Jim Caviezal's new hit TV series, PERSON OF INTEREST,this version of THE PRISONER takes on a even newer meaning,almost like having it's own DANGER MAN, so to speak.

1477415,"I've been trying to understand why some seem to be lukewarm about BRAVE.  Some would like to see the beginning cut so that the action starts sooner, I would say that you'd miss the exposition if it wasn't there.  I, for one, enjoyed every minute of it.  Some have said that the backgrounds were too realistic, I think the backgrounds (and all the animation) is just incredibly beautiful.  I would agree with the sentiment that it would have been nice to see more of the mother/daughter interaction, but then the movie would have been too long for the younger kids.  It's there appropriately, but when the mother and daughter's relationship changes it could have been a slower process and I'd have enjoyed it because I'm at an age where I can enjoy the subtle changes.  A ten-year-old wouldn't like that so I can understand the choice.  I've read all the negative reviews, but I just don't agree.  BRAVE is a great film.As for this 5-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition - It's fine.  I would have liked a sound remix for the 2 channel Dolby.  The dialogue is slightly too weak or the musical soundtrack too loud.  But if you aren't listening to the film on internal TV speakers then you're fine.  It's all great and nothing too terribly distracting.  It's great that Disney included so many extras.  That makes buying these versions worth the extra $$.

1379106,"A film of excellent dramatic tension, although slow to start. Four friends rent a house for a summer holiday and when, David, the son of one of the couples arrives, tensions begin to seep out into the open. Matteo, on sighting the perfection of David, has an epiphany, which undercuts all his (and others) perceptions of themselves and their futures. Acting (particularly by the gorgeous Massimo Poggio who plays Matteo)was superb; his inner struggle between his heart's desire and the life he has carved for himself from poor beginnings was powerful. The movie's direction was excellent: the slow build up of tension until the final, highly emotional denouement was perfectly timed. DAVID'S BIRTHDAY was a subtle and sensitive exploration of how our hidden passions can erupt with volcanic force.",N/A

223878,"Director Ridley Scott (1937) is a remarkable film director; ""The Duellists"" (1977) was his first featured film and it portended his following notable films: ""Alien"" (1979), ""Blade Runner"" (1982) and ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001) amongst others.The story is as follows. During Napoleonic era two young officers clash. D'Hubert is commissioned by his commanding officer to arrest Feraud for having injured, in a duel, a relative of a local authority.Feraud unreasonably take offense and force D'Hubert to duel with him then and there. He loses and the contenders are separated by the bystanders.War immediately separates the rivals. Notwithstanding Feraud conceive unquenched hatred for D'Hubert and will seek thru the following years and all over Europe to restart dueling. D'Hubert forced by his sense of honor complies and fights his enemy with sword, saber or pistol; on horse or on foot; even retreating in Russian winter.After years of this madness a final confrontation arrives.Ridley Scott masterly follows the crisscrossing characters giving way to a shaking action film.Play acting is very good. Keith Carradine as D'Hubert and Harvey Keitel as Feraud flesh their characters convincingly. Diana Quick as Laura, D'Hubert mistress, is very good and Cristina Raines as his wife too.Cinematography in charge of debutant Frank Tidy is excellent showing landscapes with a resemblance of impressionist paintings. He was nominated for Best Cinematography by BAFTA Awards and British Society of Cinematographers.This is an outstanding period reconstruction film, that may be enjoyed by different audiences!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",N/A

Cinch Saunders certainly had his character flaws, but not many more than arrogant, unforgiving Colt.  It amazes me that everybody raves about what a great job all the other actors did in this movie, while completely overlooking Tryon's part in it.  He gave some depth to an interesting character, and handled all the action scenes extremely well.  (Just try doing all that stuff gracefully with an arm strapped down!)  Yes, all the actors did a decent portrayal of their characters, but Tom Tryon's brooding performance is the one that stands out in this otherwise run-of-the-mill movie.",N/A

Although the allegory is thinly veiled, and the logic somewhat flawed, it still packs a significant punch. The movie deals with themes we're all familiar with but adds a freshness to the mix by placing a stranded alien race at the heart of the matter. There's lots of gore, lots of profanity, lots of energy, and lots of humour. And the message is thoughtfully constructed: the lead character's dramatic and poignant epiphany is all the more believable because of his conflicted viewpoint. It's also worth mentioning the effects, which are impressive given the apparently modest budget. Excellent and worthy of 4.5/5.",N/A

This production selects excellent parts of the book and develops them in a riveting drama - even though we all know the end - the tension developed in the movie keeps everyone attentive. It is also timely since the suggestion is that we need to get back to pragmatic politics in order to accomplish things.

Holmes has met his intellectual match in Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) who not only plans to launch a massive war in Europe but make himself incredibly wealthy and rid himself of his arch enemy at the same time.The first twenty minutes of the film establishes Moriarty as Holmes' equal and he clearly places our heroes in great peril. Rachel McAdams does a cameo and Stephen Fry (of Blackadder and Fry and Laurie fame)also appears as Sherlock Holmes' smarter brother. While Jared Harris' Moriarty is not as imposing as Mark Strong's Lord Blackwood, Moriarty does have numerous henchman to do his dirty work and there is a scene which Harris displays his acting range in a chilling scene where he tortures Holmes with a calm and ruthless demeanor and while Holmes manages to escape, he is left physically weaken for his upcoming duel with the professor.The movie looks brillant and captures the sense of adventure and danger to satisfy both action and detective fans alike. I would rate this movie 5 stars however the blu ray combo pack lacks a digital copy. I went to numerous stores trying to find one and it is only available with Ultraviolet, which is not mainstream yet and I have no desire or interest in their service. The first Sherlock Holmes came with a digital copy which I enjoyed on a flight to Germany, sadly, if I want one of this film I will have to buy it twice. I have no issues buying a movie by itself, I've done it many times but when it is advertised with a digital copy, I expect a digital copy I can use on my PC or iTunes.Regardless of the digital copy, the film is worth owing and watching over and over again, the Train scene and the final confrontation with Downey and Harris makes this movie a must see and here is hoping for another adventure.",N/A

1536402,"If you're as out of the loop as I am, you might think Journey 2 was a sequel. I asked my kids, ""Have you seen Journey 1"" and they rolled their eyes at me. So don't let the title fool you. You don't need to see the 2008 movie to follow along. This is a stand alone, exciting film that the whole family can enjoy.  I love stories that pull inspiration from the classics, but still make the storyline fresh and original. That is what you will find with this movie. Characters and locations from classic books like ""Treasure Island"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" come into play, as does the historical lost city of Atlantis. Some things parallel these classic tales, but its definitely not a tired imitation. Still, if you're looking for a movie with surprising twists and turns, this might not be the choice for you.  The plot is predictable, but still entertaining, especially for kids.  The special effects are fantastic, especially in 3D. I think the cast was well selected. There are lots of familiar faces that the kids already know and love, and seeing them working together gives them a thrill. This is definitely a great movie for family night.  But what I think I love the most about this movie is that is has encouraged my children to look for the classic novels they mentioned. Anything that can encourage a nine year old boy to pick up a book is a hit in my opinion.",N/A
1518566,"When I saw this movie I was hoping for a great swash buckling costume drama. That was not what I got.  This movie was ridiculous, that was really the only word for it. I cannot imagine what the people who put this thing together were thinking. The plot staggers all over the place without any substance. There is no drive to the story, no point to carry the story along. None of the heros made any connection with me, and did not leave me caring what happened to them. My impression of the King of France was to wonder why anyone would bother to fight for him.  The villians were just plain silly.  The Cardinal, supposed to be the main driving mastermind villan of the story, instead comes across as vague, bland and uninteresting.  The Duke of Buckingham was played more like a villain from an old cartoon show. There is a difference between comedy and farce, but you would not be able to tell that from this movie, which was pure farce.The sword fighting and special effects were nice to see, but nothing in the plot made any sense. The number of totally absurd things that happen are endless. You have whole fleets of flying boat/dirigibles, machine guns, flame throwers, intricate ""Temple of Doom"" type traps.Plus a Milady character who is a James Bond/Indiana Jones superspy. She slaughters an entire company of well armed musketeers in one scene, all while garbed in an elaborate French court gown, complete with nine layers of petty coats, and never even musses her hair. She sword fights better than Zorro, evades booby traps better than any cat burglar, again while never getting her wardrobe unsettled. And all of this happening in the 17th century!  And so on and so forth.  I like a good fantasy, but this was utterly ridiculous!It was a relief when this movie came to an end.

1500660,"I'll be honest. I was a little reluctant to watch this movie. The premise seemed a little too slow and sappy but I figured I'd watch it with the family on slow night. To my surprise it was actually a very good movie, a nice little travel film, and oh, I dunno, had a decent plot too. There are no car chases, firy explosions or ridiculolus special effects, just good acting, good directing, and a zen-like exploration of who we are, who we think we are, where we're going, and why. It eases into its depth with humor and style and while it's premise borders on the religious pilgrimage to the shrine at Santiago, Spain, it's actually more of a buddy movie with a quartet of unlikely travellers who use the pilgimage as an excuse to deal with various degrees of loss; of loved ones, of self, faith, or just a writer's fickle muse.It's well worth a look, even when it's not a slow night, and maybe when you want something more satisfying from Hollywood.",N/A

It begins quite naturally with his childhood and the difficulties his father undertook to get that genius understood. This movie is inundated with subtitles but they worth suffering through if you want t5o learn a little more about this astounding individual. I recommend that you watch the movie Amadeus before watching this as this will dispel some of the myths set forth by that movie and instil a curiosity about the man. While Amadeus was an unquestionably fantastic film it really provides an unrealistic version of the person. It does however instil a thirst to learn more about Mozart's life and this documentary provides the viewer with knowledge that cannot be obtained in the confines of a dramatic interpretation that was designed to entertain the uneducated viewer.

1257265,"This is a British comedy about the owner of an old broken down castle. The owner is up to his eyeballs in debt and the place is falling apart. There is a beautiful ghost that makes quite a few appearances in this film and they did it very well. I was impressed at how well they did the ghost given the age of the film. I don't think they could've done the ghost better with today's technology/tricks.There is much going on as he tries to keep the place afloat by renting rooms (and trying to keep those guests from leaving), giving guided tours to the public (for a fee of course), avoiding creditors who want to claim the place for his debt, trying to convince a woman from Denver to buy the place, while at the same time trying to convince an official from the coal board that the place is unfit to live in so he won't convince the board to take it over for a hostel - and a woman trying to get him declared the rightful King of Scotland. It's fast paced, cute and amusing.However this old black and white film has seen better days and the picture quality is poor and sometimes a little hard to catch all the lines (due to the accents and that they talk a bit fast).

Centering around a father and his two grown sons, all three of whom are estranged from each other, it culminates in the most unlikely scenario.  Recommended for anyone who loves great movies, not just male action-movie fans or UFC fans, especially as a great brothers movie, and, yes, it's also better than ""The Fighter"" (Mark Wahlberg).  Nick Nolte should have won the Oscar for Supporting Actor but unfortunately had to go up against someone who's been in the industry even longer, Christopher Plummer (who won for ""Beginners,"" best known for ""The Sound of Music""); otherwise, the Oscar was his.

750634,"If you loved ""Saw,"" then you will love ""Saw II."" This is a pretty good sequel that brings us more surprises and twists. Like the first film, ""Saw II"" is smart, intense but gorier and you'll see how cleverly it ties in with the first ""Saw."" Jigsaw is up to his old tricks again. It's a new game with new horrific traps aimed at people who need to be more appreciative of their lives. And there is also another unbelievable ending that you won't see coming.The movie is based around Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and John Kramer (a.k.a ""Jigsaw"")(Tobin Bell). You get to see a lot more of Jigsaw in this film, and both Whalberg and Bell do a fantastic job with their roles. Detective Matthews is called out by the psychopathic Jigsaw as he investigates a Jigsaw crime scene. Not long after, Matthews and the rest of the police/SWAT team burst into an old building where Jigsaw is practically waiting for them. When confronting Jigsaw, Matthews finds out that he has a huge problem on his hands. Jigsaw has captured his son, along with 7 other people and is holding them in an old abandoned house where they are breathing in a deadly nerve gas. It's Jigsaw's latest game. In three hours, the door to the house will open, but everyone will die within two hours. To avoid death, they must survive the traps around the house and acquire the antidotes hidden within them. But there is also a clue that Jigsaw gives to obtain one of the antidotes locked in a safe; ""You all possess the combination to the safe. Think hard. The numbers are in the back of your mind."" This clue makes for some pretty horrific and intense moments in the film.All 8 of these people have more in common than they realize. Once you find this out, it's easier to understand why detective Matthews has been thrown into this vicious game to save his son. Jigsaw knows all about who Matthews really is. Yes, basically two games that tie together are going on at the same time. While the 8 people are trying to survive in the house, Matthews must play his own game with Jigsaw right in front of him. All Jigsaw wants is some time to chat with him. If he simply does that, then he will see his son again. For Matthews, it's harder than it seems and the desperation and anger that overcomes him will lead him to another ultimate test along with the haunting answer to the question: ""What is the cure for cancer?""The characters in the film are all portrayed well. Tobin Bell as the cancer-ridden Jigsaw is calm, cool, collected, yet creepy, sick and twisted. Donnie Wahlberg gives us a tough, angry, desperate cop in Eric Matthews. He does a great job and his emotion is clearly felt. Matthews' son Daniel (played by Erik Knudsen) comes off as a hard-ass at the start of the movie, yet when kidnapped, turns into a somewhat innocent, emotional kid in the face of the others. Shawnee Smith is back as Amanda, which was a nice twist to the film. She is an essential character to the movie and we get to see a lot more background on this infamous Jigsaw trap survivor from the first film. One of the best characters in the movie who gets the horror flowing nicely in the abandoned house is Xavier (Frankie G.). He's a big, self-centered, muscular tough guy who shows viciously how far he will go to save himself. He pulls out all the stops toward the end of the film and is involved in my favorite scene from the movie pertaining to the number on the back of his neck. Then there's Obi (Timothy Burd), an interesting character who played a pivotal role in why they're all in the house. His role is small, but very memorable. Glenn Plummer plays Jonas, one of the more rational members of the group. All the characters compliment themselves nicely in the movie; a good solid cast.The traps of course, help make the movie. The film opens with my personal favorite. A man named Michael; a snitch/informant wears a Venus flytrap-style death mask that will close up around him unless he retrieves the key from in his eye socket and unlocks it. It's a perfect grisly intro that gives you the impression that ""yes, there will be blood."" Besides the gas house trap itself that makes everyone go crazy, you'll also see the gun-in-the-peephole trap, the syringe pit, the oven fire trap and the blood-soaked wrist-cutting trap. There's even a trap ready for the SWAT team who dash into the old building where Jigsaw is during the first part of the movie. One guy gets his legs broken and sparks fly everywhere.""Saw II"" is a bit more fast-paced than the original, and though I like the original a little better, this sequel still delivers. Writer/Director Darren Lynn Bousman does a great job, and Leigh Whannell (writer and actor in the first Saw) came back to help write this sequel and does a fantastic job. If you've seen the first ""Saw,"" you must see this one. Bloody and suspenseful, this is a horror movie that will have you wondering what will happen next throughout the film. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.",Saw II

However, the reality was confusing, boring and difficult to follow.There is a far better version of the life of Margaret Thatcher, another unique approach to the life of Margaret Thatcher, but one that works: ""The Rise and Fall of Margaret Thatcher"". This is a sterling BBC production, using 3 actresses ( Andrea Riseborough, Patricia Hodge, Lindsay Duncan) to portray a very accurate representation of Mrs.Thatcher's life. I would highly recommend this 2 disc set to anyone wishing to learn more about Mrs. Thatcher and her times.Meryl Streep tried her best, all of the actors gave it their best, but -""The Iron Lady"" just did not pull it off. The flashback sequences representing the life of an aged Mrs. Thatcher and a young Mrs. Thatcher, at the height of her power, just did not work. Denis Thatcher was presented as more of a clown and buffoon in his many appearances in the hallucinations of the old Mrs. Thatcher. I felt cheated by the lack of an accurate historical representation of the ""Thatcher Era"". The movie seemed to demean Mrs. Thatcher, love her or hate her... she was a very interesting politician. She served during some very historic times in Britain, none of that is accurately presented in this film. I am not and was not a fan of Mrs. Thatcher, but she was a very interesting person. This film does not reflect the complexities of the life of Mrs. Thatcher. Buy the BBC DVD set, you will be much better served by that version of the Thatcher years in the UK.Rise & Fall of Margaret Thatcher",N/A
120313,"Romeo Must Die looks pretty sharp in HD.  Good blacks, colors, lighting, and good sharpness and texture.  It's always been a pretty good looking DVD so I expected no less from the Blu Ray.  It's a nice effort for an under-rated catalogue title that doesn't even have an image on here (what's up with that?)  The audio is top notch for a hip-op oriented track with good surrounds for the action and fight scenes.  I love the end fight with the fire all around them.  Great stuff!  Extras are the same as the DVD so nothing new, except the ""Try Again"" music video looks a little sharper upscaled.Not bad for a DVD upgrade.  Like I said, the DVD looked really good, but I needed me some HD Jet Li to get me jazzed up for Expendables 2 this weekend so this Blu-Ray did not dissapoint!",N/A

53672,"This classic film by the great Alfred Hitchcock just got even better than we ever dreamed it could or would by the development of Blu-ray.  The print is sharp and stunning.  The newly worked sound is a definite addition to the atmosphere of this wonderful horror story; tho the 2.0 mono track is available as a choice.  It was interesting to pick certain key portions of the film and start them in 5.1 and switch mid stream to 2.0 mono to immediately hear the differences on certain aspects such as the rain when driving to and arriving at the Bates Motel, the shower scene, and the submersion of the car in the lake.  Although I hasten to add, the 2.0 mono track itself sounds great on this Blu-Ray!The huge array of bonus features just adds hours of enjoyment and detail to the Blu-Ray edition.  Interviews, music information, behind the scenes filming details, insets of the master himself, plus comments from his wife and daughter I thought were just too good to be true.There is a lot of enjoy for a very reasonable price on this Blu-Ray anniversary film and if you are a fan of what many consider Hitchcock's very best film, I would recommend adding this classic to your Blu-Ray library.",N/A
362234,"HONDO:SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S EDITIONWOW! A John Wayne movie I had never seen before. I read somewhere that it had been released for DVD not to long ago. A very good movie that I really enjoyed. But then, no one tops ""The Duke""! I couldn't believe that I had never seen the movie before, altho the title was familiar to me. So I bought it and thoroughly enjoyed it. A typical John Wayne movie, full of action, some romance, adventure and some sadness. Also shows that the Indians were just as human as the White Establishment, of that time. I am so glad that I bought it and added it to my, not only collection of good Western movies, but my John Wayne collection as well. ""The Special Features"" was good on this DVD also. The little boy in this movie, tells of his (Lee Aaker) experience of working on this movie with John Wayne. Also, is very detailed of how the Apache people were treated when Geronimo surrendered. It is heartbreaking to know how the Native American Indians were and are treated, even today. The Apache and The Lakota Sioux tribes were the ones who fought so valiantly to keep their land and way of life, only to be demorialized by the white people who wanted to exterminate them. Change their whole lives because the white people wanted them to be what ""they"" thought they should be. It makes me quite Happy today to see that the Native American Tribes are relearning their own language and customs once again. Chief Red Cloud said it best:  ""THEY MADE US MANY PROMISES, MORE THAN I CAN REMEMBER. BUT THEY KEPT BUT ONE - THEY PROMISED TO TAKE OUR LAND... AND THEY TOOK IT.""Very well packaged and recieved in good time.",Hondo VHS

1531034,"""Magic School Bus"" was a major part of my TV-watching experience when I was a child. So honestly, watching the series today is a trip down memory lane -- and despite some scientific changes (such as computer advances or Pluto being exiled), ""Magic School Bus: The Complete Series"" still stands as a good, educational show for kids.The story series around Ms. Valerie Frizzle (Lily Tomlin), an eccentric elementary-school teacher who dresses according to the episode's theme. She has a sentient lizard named Liz, and a school bus that can transform into whatever the episode requires.She has a class of about eight students, who never seem to have math class or anything that requires them to actually stay in the building. Instead, Ms. Frizzle takes them on daily field trips, which the shape-shifting/time-traveling/shrinking bus allows them to do... in a very hands-on manner.So the class goes on adventures in the digestive system, the bloodstream, a pickle jar, space (multiple times), the desert, a rotting log, an anthill, the Cretaceous Period, the water cycle, the bus's engine, a toy plane, Herp Haven, a beehive, an old monster movie, the Arctic, a magic pinball machine, muscles, the rainforest, a chicken egg, the swamp, the interior of a nose, electrical currents, a computer, a coral reef and so on.And they learn about all sorts of things -- erosion, stars, cells, friction, ecosystems, microbes, recycling, tidepools, muscle oxygenation, reptiles, bats, light tricks, sound etc.  Nothing is hugely in-depth, but they give a pretty good start for kids.""Magic School Bus"" was made in the mid-1990s, but it's actually held up quite well. Except for a few things that have changed (Pluto and home computers), most of the science stuff in this series is still pretty valid. It conveys sometimes-complex scenarios (muscle oxygenation) in a simple, easy-to-understand manner.And they mix it up with plenty of comedy (Ms. Frizzle's entrances are always... unique) and some explicit demonstrations of just how these things work (a frictionless baseball game!). One warning for adults, though: lots of puns. LOTS of puns.Though the kids have the appearance of having been chosen so no ethnic group would feel left out, they're each given a pretty decent characterization. One is sensible and bookish, one is strong and impulsive, one is idealistic and always talking about her ""old school,"" one is overimaginative, one is a clown, et cetera.It's been around for almost two decades, but ""Magic School Bus: The Complete Series"" has actually aged pretty well, and is still a solid form of education/entertainment.",The Magic School Bus: The Complete Series

50697,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY VERSION ***In April 2012 Universal Studios is 100 years old - and to celebrate that movie centenary - they've had 13 of their most-celebrated films fully restored for BLU RAY. But it doesn't stop there. As many as 80 other titles will be given re-launches across the year as well - each featuring distinctive ""100th Anniversary"" card-wrap packaging and in many cases a host of new features. Most (not all) of these re-issues will be two-disc sets containing the Blu Ray, the DVD and also means to obtain a Digital Copy via download.1962's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the thirteen singled out for full restoration (see list below) - and an absolute peach it is too.Released 10 January 2012 - it comes in a gorgeous limited edition 'book pack' (Barcode 5050582881844). The outer hardback holder has a card-pouch wrapped around it at the base and a 45-page booklet contained within. The book has interviews with Veronique Peck (his wife of 40 plus years), Harper Lee (author of the 1960 novel), pictures of the Shooting Script, Original Storyboards, Original Posters and Lobby Cards (from around the world), Press Book Excerpts and even Correspondence surrounding the movie (telegrams of congratulations from Fred Astaire, Betty Bacall and Charlton Heston). It's a visual feast with loads of photos peppering the wonderful memorabilia. Universal are to be praised for this because it absolutely looks the part. But the real fireworks comes in the other two elements at play here - the extensive extras - and the glorious new print...Digitally remastered and Fully Restored from Original Film Elements - Universal are reputed to have stumped-up over $300,000 for the restoration - and the results are BEAUTIFUL. Even from the opening logo and credits of a child drawing - there are no lines or scratches of any kind - and the black and white cinematography of 1930's Alabama is fantastically clear. Stand-out clarity - the scene where the accused black man Tom Robertson is sweating in the courtroom as he relays his side of the story (a superlative Brock Peters - he read the Eulogy at Peck's funeral in 2003 at Peck's request), Atticus's son Jem is in his dad's car outside the family home of the black Robertson family as the hateful Bob Ewell looks on, the three children watching from the bushes as the mob try to take the jail with Atticus guarding the doorway, Atticus explaining what happened to Tom Robertson after the trial as the moonlight shines on his suit, the young girl Scout pointing out the simpleton Boo Radley behind the bedroom door (Robert Duvall's stunning cinematic debut where he doesn't utter a word but leaves an indelible mark) - it's all suddenly gorgeous. And the sound is rounded and clean too. An exemplary job.The extras are equally superb - the centrepiece of which is a near one and half-hour documentary called ""A Conversation With..."" It's a feast for Peck fans - interviews with Barry Norman in 1974, Terry Wogan in 1979 and other notables throughout the years are peppered with home movies and footage of Peck giving a one-on-one show to a Virginia audience in 1999. It's a raconteur tour-de-force a la David Niven - an 83-year old Peck is generous, charming, witty, responsive - full of anecdotes about Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Harper Lee. We get stories about meeting his wife in Paris just before shooting for ""Roman Holiday"" began - there's footage of dinner with the President of France Jacques Chirac and his family - a visit to Niagara Falls with his daughter Cecilia (handshakes with an adoring public) - US President Bill Clinton giving Peck the National Medal Of Arts and dropping it! But most of all as the minutes pass by you 'get' why Gregory Peck was greeted with such staggering affection everywhere he went in the world - he literally exuded 'good guy' from his every pore - that old style Hollywood class - a talented giant who didn't have a mean bone in his body. It's joyful stuff to watch.The movie itself has entered into folklore - released in 1962 and filmed in Black and White - it primarily centres on a black man accused of raping a white woman and the trial that follows. Such was the power of the story - and especially Peck's central performance as the principled lawyer Atticus Finch (his only Oscar win) it literally inspired members of the public to take up the law as a profession and even impacted on America's turbulent and changing racial landscape of the time. The performances by the children as innocents are particularly superb too - but it's Peck who dominates the whole thing with a gravitas and sincerity that few actors could match. His stand against bigotry is magnificent and filled with a quiet decency that has touched audiences for decades. As if sensing the importance of the part, Peck's scrawl is all over the shooting script - to the point that it often obliterates the text - the four words he scribbled on the last page describing the character he plays title this review - and describe the great man himself.To sum up - with the 1930 anti-war masterpiece ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" also being amongst the first vanguard of these 'restored' releases - it's heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of its movie legacy - and be proud about doing so too. I for one will collect the whole series - and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.An absolutely first-class release - and then some.BLU RAY Specifications:EXTRAS:1.

1530957,"VCI seems to be on a roll lately, releasing several excellent DVDs of films that aren't great masterpieces but are still welcome additions to one's film library.  The picture quality is great.  The sound track is a little tinny, but that's characteristic of British films of this era.  Subtitles are offered.The story is based on the autobiography of Marthe McKenna, which was a best seller in its day.  The screenplay is realistic and brings out the emotional conflicts of all the characters.  War is not a matter of black and white, but a lot of screenplays treat it that way.  The cast, headed by Madeleine Carroll, Conrad Veidt and Herbert Marshall is excellent and there are strong supporting performances by the usual British character actors.  Victor Saville's direction really shines in the scenes of masses of troops, but he handles the more intimate scenes well too, and manages to create a sense of claustrophobia where appropriate.  There are several of those camera zooms characteristic of early talkies that were necessary to keep the sound of the camera from being recorded on the soundtrack but which look a bit odd to modern audiences.  Don't mistake them for poor cinematography.  They were a technological necessity in their day.Based on this one, I can hardly wait to watch the rest of VCI's new releases.",I Was A Spy

1496159,"It's been over a decade since there was a new season of ""Slayers,"" but better late than never.And ""Slayers: Complete Seasons 4 & 5"" (which is really more like one longer season split in half) is a solid fantasy-comedy anime, although it suffers from some wobbles in execution (a replica of the Sword of Light?). Not only is it fun to revisit Lina, Gourry and their colorful unruly world, but the writers introduce some clever twists and concepts along the way, while dipping into some surprisingly dark subplots.Lina and Gourry have been busy nabbing pirates on the high seas, but they're unexpectedly interrupted by Amelia, Zelgadis, and the Ruvinagald Inspector Wizer, who promptly arrests Lina for ""the crime of being Lina Inverse""... and for blowing up some magic tanks with the Dragonslave.  The actual culprit is actually a sort of... flying stuffed bunny thing called Pokota, who can cast almost every spell Lina knows AND has a Sword of Light replica.The gang ends up on the road again, pursuing Pokota and being dogged by Wizer. And after many wacky adventures, Pokota brings them to the long-lost city of Taforashia, whose people are locked in a magical sleep (courtesy of the Red Priest Rezo). Unfortunately, an evil countess and her three minions are using Taforashia's magical technology for themselves, unleashing a devastating force on the entire world.But that isn't the end of their adventures, as Lina and Co. go off to find the Hellmaster's Jar, a magical pot that contains the soul of Rezo. Unfortunately, Xellos is also trying to get his hands on the jar, and Pokota is determined to resurrect Rezo for the sake of his people.I'm not entirely sure why they decided to split this season into two smaller seasons, ""Slayers Revolution"" and ""Slayers Evolution-R."" But it's a pretty decent fourth chapter to the Slayers saga -- we have the usual slapsticky high fantasy, some darker subplots, and lots of big flashy magic battles. And of course, Lina and Gourry eating, fighting and chasing bandits (or, er, pirates).There's plenty of hilarious dialogue and comic relief (Gourry's special bond with a jellyfish chimera), especially in the hilarious ""soap opera"" episode (""The shock of the accident's given me amnesia!"" ""I have amnesia too!""). But things get much darker in the second half of the season, with some gruesome deaths, creepy monsters (hair tentacles!) and a horrific flashback where we see how poor Zelgadis became a chimera.The biggest problems are that some of the plot points seem kind of hokey (an exact working replica of the ""Sword of Light""? COPOUT!) and the Epic Climactic Battle feels like a copy of a previous Epic Climactic Battle from way back in the first season.Lina is still bombastic and a little crazy, but she also seems more intelligent this time around, since she's apparently able to unravel people's nefarious plots. Gourry is good-hearted and dumb, Amelia is a little more savvy about real life (though she still loves ""justice!""), and poor Zelgadis is forced to relive the horrors of his transformation into a chimera -- the scene where he finally confronts Rezo's soul is hauntingly powerful.Oh, and a few familiar characters return: Rezo has a major role in the second half of the story, Xellos is still keeping secrets, and the mysterious ""Nama"" seems awfully familiar to Slayers fans.""Slayers: Complete Seasons 4 & 5 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)"" sounds like it's a lot longer than it is, but it's basically your average Slayers season -- lots of wild, crazy fantasy action with some darker parts.",Slayers: Complete Seasons 4 & 5

The trap is set.Zona and Matilde go to the postern gate. The trap swings shut, but ""The Torch"" escapes. Stadt follows through the secret door and talks to Monte Cristo. A mistake. The Russian Ambassador visits General Lanen, they will put Lanen on the throne and keep him there. This will make Lichtenburg a Russian province! Zona agrees to marry Lanen. ""The Torch"" robs the Russian Ambassador of his secret paper. ""You'll hang for this."" Can this paper create a popular revolt? Lanen surmises the identity of ""The Torch"". Can he get proof? He tells Zona of the capture of ""The Torch"". This trick works! The Count of Monte Cristo is arrested! The Royal Marriage is announced. ""This is the happiest day of my life!"" Prisoners are brought into the dungeon. [Trojan horses?] Edmond plans to reveal the secret treaty and stop the wedding. [The dress of the priest says Greek Orthodox.] The ceremony begins. ""The Torch"" arrives at the palace and there is conflict. But Lanen has a trick to force the marriage. Something happens! Lanen falls and doesn't get up. ""Long Live Zona of Lichtenburg!""This would be an ordinary adventure movie except for being made in 1940 (given the European situation then). Given the year, this small country that wants the protection of French troops and is afraid of Russian troops must be in the Baltics, not the Balkans. A change in the rulers of a country has an effect on surrounding countries (see European history). There is a hidden message here (as in ""The Prisoner of Zenda""). Does Lichtenburg's importance derive from its geography or from its exports? That isn't mentioned. Who controls the army controls the government, then or now.

903412,"I have always been aware of Dr. Who but somehow it seemed daunting to slog through 40+ years of material.  We somehow got into Torchwood and enjoyed it, but started getting an inkling that Jack was actually from Dr. Who and got curious.  In fact, it turns out that Torchwood is an anagram for Doctor Who.  So having completed Children of Earth and waiting for the next series to hit DVD, we checked it out.THE SERIESIt seemed campy to me, and I didn't love the characters when I first met them, but it didn't take long to warm to them.  By the end, I loved them and respected them both deeply in important ways: they had depth and character beyond many characters on other shows, even to a greater extent I think than on Torchwood, but of course there are two main characters here, so there is more time to explore them.  The Doctor and Rose both have a lot of heart and care a lot for each other - more as the story goes on - though Rose shows it from the beginning, and The Doctor opens up more as it goes on.  The characters are also intelligent, as are the stories.Like Torchwood, stories are unusual for science fiction, if you would even call it that.  I won't say there are NO space ships or that nothing blows up, and there is one scene that reminded me of a Hollywood action event, but these things are not the point.  The point is the stories, the drama, the PEOPLE.  The people make this show worth watching.  The events in the stories are mysterious, but in general there is usually something human - or something unusually alien - behind events and characters.There are a couple of stories that are complex enough that they had to span two episode to get fleshed out and resolved.  One in particular is one of the highlights of the series IMO.It is and is not violent.  When it is violent, it is not in the usual way.  A lot of people, or aliens, do die in the course of events.  ""Death follows Dr. Who"" is one of the slogans, and it's true, though it is generally as a result of problems he is trying to solve (that is, people are killed by aliens) or a sacrifice in the solution (people or aliens must die to solve the problem).  He tends not to kill directly so much as let it happen when it must.TORCHWOOD COMPARISON AND OVERLAPUnlike Torchwood, there is very little sexual tension in the stories.  I would not say none by any means, particularly when Captain Jack makes his appearance; after all, he's kind of an omnisexual guy.  But this series IS suitable for a younger audience than Torchwood, which has implied sex, and some a bit more than that.It was really fun to meet the cast of Torchwood, as we half-expected to do.  We knew we would meet Jack, though I thought it would be much later.  There were two other central cast characters from Torchwood who made single-episode appearances, though in different (yet somewhat similar) roles; I will let this be a surprise for you.  From having watched Torchwood, I know at least one more cast member will appear, and I suspect two more may show up.EXTRASLike Torchwood, there is an extra disk with 2+ hours of 12+ minute reviews of each episodes, with interviews of the actors, writers, producers, special effects people, and so on.  These are great fun after watching the series.  It really reminds me how great the series we just watched was, and provides some insight and some bits you may have missed.  Definitely recommended.BOTTOM LINEMy girlfriend is not often a fan of science fiction, but this is not the usual science fiction, and she likes this.

The basic truths of the historical material are nailed own and it's the fictional details that give it the lurid drama we love.  In actual fact, no extreme was taboo for this devilish family that played hard and loose with notions of piety and deity, to say nothing of power and greed.

1494948,"This is a wonderful little film, a beutiful love affair with Paris of both today and a bygone era.  It's a pleasant and enchanting story about a modern day writer (Owen Wilson)who magically travels back in time to Paris in the 1920s where he meets famous writers and artists of the the time including Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Picasso, and Gertrude Stein, and maybe where he falls in love.  The cinematography in sumptious and the attention to period detail amazing.  Do you need to know these writers and artists?  Not really.  If you know a little about how Hemingway writes, you'll appreciate how funny a character Woody Allen has created in his Hemingway.  Other than that, most of the historical people are window-dressing (although there's a really funny scene built around a meeting of surrealist artists including Adrian Brody as Salvadore Dali).  Humor is at times subtle and at other times broad.  Much of the broad humor comes from remarks about the writer (Wilson) made by Rachel McAdams as his fiancee, and by her mother -- but for me, the two female characters are so bitchy as to be obnoxious.  I think, for the sake of humor, Woody Allen erred in making the fiancee and her parents such stereotypes.  It is the only false note in an otherwise wonderful and lovely movie. For me, Midnight in Paris is worth owning as I expect to watch it many times over.",N/A

Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha all return in this sequel to the wildly successful 2009 comedy. This time it's Stu (Helms) who is about to be married and his friends are in Thailand for the wedding with Alan (Galifianakis) being brought along out of pity. However, this time Stu is determined to avoid being drugged. Imagine his surprise when, once in Thailand, that is exactly what happens.

And upon inspection of their unfamiliar surroundings, they find his finger on the coffee table still bearing his class ring.I'll admit that I, unlike most viewers, saw the first film and considered entertaining rather than hilarious. The second film is certainly lesser, at least as entertainment. In 2010, an action/comedy titled The Losers introduced the idea of `green terrorism' by demonstrating a fictional explosive with all the destructive power of a nuclear bomb that created no radiation or fallout. The Hangover II is essentially a ""green comedy"". Whatever esthetic differences there might be, it's primarily recycled materials from the previous film.",N/A

1307388,"Further proof that finding a decent comedy nowadays is like finding Bigfoot.  Where do I start with this steaming pile of convoluted cow dung. The adorable Rachel Mcadams plays a morning show tv producer who has just been given the axe by her employers.  She is quickly hired by a much less respected network and sets out to pull this faltering news show out of the dumps.  Now that I have given a general synopsis I will continue to do what I had originaly intended to do here, completely trash this abysmal train wreck of a movie that stole nearly 2 hours of my life.  Mcadams is about as appealing as a chiuaua on speed in this movie,  she jumps around, chatters endlessly and knocks things over.  It was cute for about 10 minutes but got exhausting fast.  Enter the great Dianne Keaton, a foul mouthed news anchor who's less than satisfied with her role at the network,  she is given little to do here and gives the ""hey as long as the check clears"" impression.  We are then introduced to a character played by the usually dependable Harrison Ford, a gruff sarcastic highly esteemed news anchor who feels this network is beneath him, hey maybe thats a parable about this whole movie being beneath him.  The absolute worse thing about Morning Glory are the endless movie cliche's.  This was as predictical as movies get, not helped by annoying songs interspresed with scenes that were more jarring than feel good.  I wont even go into the forced love story subplot involving another coworker (Patrick Wilson in a completely thankless role).  What pisses me off the most about this movie is that this could have been a great movie.  You have the talents of Keaton and Ford playing bickering news anchors and with some good writing could have been comic gold! instead we are treated to a juvenile been thier done that a million times so called ""rom com"" that started decent then got bad then got horrible!

228917,"This 1980's version of ""Mansfield Park"" is much truer to the novel than either the 1999 movie or the 2007 TV adaptation of the same name.  Unfortunately, this doesn't mean it's any better. It's just bad in its own, odd way.The most jarring element in this production is Sylvestra Le Touzel's portrayal of Fanny Price. Le Touzel, looking like a Victorian doll or a DW Griffith star, acts as if Fanny just escaped from a mental ward--or should be in one. Throughout the series she makes strange little slashes with her hands whenever she talks.  I think this is supposed to show her earnestness, but instead it starts to look as if she's practicing some bizarre sort of kung fu or as if she's patting an invisible dog.Austen's Fanny Price is gentle, repressed, but upright. Instead, Le Touzel alternates between cold blankness, hysteria (she becomes so shrill and gibbering during her scene with Sir Thomas I ended up fastforwarding the scene), and abruptly shouted ""No's"", making it impossible to understand why so many characters find her endearing. She is both erratic and insufferable. (Le Touzel later redeemed herself as the comic, clothes-minded Mrs. Allen in ""Northanger Abbey"").Most of the other characters, with the exception of Angela Pleasence's deranged Lady Bertram, are well done. Cinematic Mary Crawfords have always fared better than cinematic Fanny Prices, and Jackie Smith-Wood brings wit and warmth to the role.  Bernard Hepton gives Sir Thomas the right amount of gravitas and graciousness. Nicholas Farrell, a longtime favorite, is also very good as Edmund Bertram, despite that character's occasional pomposity.In staying scrupulously faithful to the novel, the script includes virtually all the novel's dialogue, to the detriment of pacing and plot. It PLODS until two thirds of the way through, when it suddenly picks up speed and interest, to the point of cramming in too many events and resolutions all at once.Like so many other reviewers, I am still hoping for a ""Mansfield Park"" that stays true to Austen's characters while streamlining the story and mining all the humor that exists within the text.",Mansfield Park VHS

1465377,"SAFE HOUSE is a movie looking for a story. It is a film that is packed with fine actors who've proved their chops many times, but here writer David Guggenheim has simply failed to give them a plausible, sensible story and all that is left after movie's end is confusion and a lot of smoke, fire, and debris and scratching of the head. Daniel Espinosa directs obtusely.Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a bored but in love CIA rookie whose tedious assignment it is to man a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa: he longs for a European assignment but his position on the CIA totem pole is far too low for anything other than where he is, according to his boss Dave Barlow (Brendan Gleason). Things change rather abruptly when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) the CIA's most wanted rogue agent is captured and taken to the safe house. The CIA suddenly sees Matt's position as key and his bosses (Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard et al) see that they finally have caught the dangerous rouge CIA Tobin Frost. In interrogation ensues but during Frost's interrogation, the safe house is overtaken by mercenaries who want Frost. Weston and Frost escape and must stay out of the gunmen's sight until they can get to another safe house. From there on it is chase scenes segueing into chase scenes and very little makes sense to the point that few in the audience will care what happens.Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington are always a delight to watch and even with this little bit of a mess of a movie they still make it watchable. The rest of the big name actors - Farmiga, Gleason, Shepard, Rub&eacute;n Blades, Robert Patrick, Liam Cunningham and Nora Arnezeder - are barely given enough lines to exist.

Why wouldn't she think about her dog, that is all they have up there...time to think. I thought the scene when she finally has to go the bathroom was so raw. On top of all that has happened-getting stuck, seeing your boyfriend in agony only to die, frost bite on your face...you have suffer the ultimate act of hopelessness and helplessness by having to pee on yourself.

Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza, a gypsy who Downey and Law must team up with along the way. Simza is a mysterious character, though a bit wooden. Jared Harris does an excellent job as the infamous Professor Moriarty. As Holmes' greatest adversary in the original novels, Moriarty is the only person who is on the same intellectual level as Holmes.A Game of Shadows is a strong sequel to Downey's first Sherlock Holmes film. I enjoyed this story a bit more in fact, as there were no elements of the bizarre mysticism of the first. This was another wild ride of humor, drama, mystery, and action-packed adventure.  The mystery and suspense kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat. And the many comic relief lines had me laughing out loud. The suspense built to a massive climactic ending that was a bit predictable, yet completely enjoyable all the same.

Unlike that one this movie actually has a plot.It is about 2 teenagers from 2 different groups in high school who are attracted to one another but never speak.  Emma is super organized and never questions anything.  Dean is a loner who is left alone by his father more often than not.  Both are fairly nice people.  Then, of course, they trapped on an island together.  While on the island they fall in love.  Dean opens up to Emma and begins to get over his mother's death.  Emma learns to loosen up and to take things as they come.  Both teenagers mature a great deal.  Once they get rescued Emma is uncertain of how to deal with home.  She and Dean sort of go back to being the way they were before, but they can't change the fact that they've both grown up or that they still have feelings for one another.  Emma goes to prom and takes her little over-looked sister as her date.  Dean, with his father's encouragement, shows up.  Dean stands out in the rain.  Emma comes out and they get back together and end up having their first dance at home in the rain.The acting is not so bad.  The setting is beautiful.  All in all this is not a bad film.

Then a little midnight caper, a little heist,  turns sour, a cop gets a little suspicious since there have been a ton of burglaries and robberies in the neighborhood and the guy goes crazy, and the cop winds up dead, very dead.Of course when a cop gets killed other cops are ready to work night and day 24/7/365 to bring the culprit to justice and it that process of bringing that stone-cold psycho killer to justice that drives this little film noir police procedural, He Walked By Night. They don't start with much to work with since our psycho was very smart, had a sophisticated scheme, and was very knowledgeable about what the cops were up to as they closed in on him. And that in the end was his undoing as some very ordinary back-filling police work leads to his identification.Funny as classically well done as this film is as a police procedural (getting the bad guys after all is what crime film noir is all about) it was not at all clear why our culprit turned on society and that failing takes away from each of the actions to try to corral him. So we will definitely have to put this in the B-film files although the scenes at the end when the cops corral our mad monk psycho are very evocative of other famous chase scenes (think The Third Man).",He Walked By Night VHS

1571741,"Still trying to figure what is the point of the movie. If the point was to underline the huge potential of AnnaLynne McCord as an upcoming talent, then the movie was a complete success and deserves five stars. However, if the whole exercise was to highlight some kind of pseudo intellectual filmography or direction, or plot, then the movie is a total failure and deserves one star.The story is very simple. Pauline (AnnaLynne McCord) is a very emotionally disturbeb adolescent. She is going to high school with normal kids and we wonder why this kid is in a normal high school instead of an institution. She really speaks her thoughts freely in the morning (at breakfast) or at night (at dinner) with her family, or in school (during class) with her teachers. We follow the dreams of Pauline through the movie and we know that something really bad is coming. Not afraid to confront the high school bullies who are making fun of her. Her father is totally passive while her mother (Traci Lords) is uptight and nasty and only cares about her younger sister who has cystic fibrosis and is slowly dying. She is going to therapy with her priest because her parents are cheap and really don't think that there is anything wrong with her. Pauline is fascinated with science and wants to become a surgeon. Yeah right! Like this is going to happen with her attitude...We expect something major (bad) to happen and it indeed really happens.Malcolm McDowell gives a solid but not significant (as far as the movie plot) performance. I am not sure if Traci Lords was always a bad actrice (even in her previous career) or is just a bad performance in this film, but she is really not up to par in this movie. It is also a very short movie. It is only 81 min with titles rolling and everything. They could have developed the plot a lit bit more if they really wanted to. But I think they run out of blood... for the special effects.I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. It is not a good movie even for horror fans. The special effects are really minimal and involve lots of blood and ...more blood. Nothing special!  Three stars overall for the outstanding performance of AnnaLynn McCord only.",N/A

1585000,"... of the 21st Century! With ""Il Postino,"" Mexican composer Daniel Cat&aacute;n has crafted an opera closer in both music and drama to the operas of Puccini than to those of Stravinsky, Berg, or Prokofiev, not to mention Glass or Adams! It's not post-modern; it's as if modernism never happened! And guess what? It works! It's a moving piece of narrative theater, made powerful by the brilliant ACTING of Pl&aacute;cido Domingo as Pablo Neruda and Charles Castronovo as the rural postman Mario. The Spanish-language libretto stays quite close to the Italian cinema Il Postino, but the character portrayals in the opera are even better than those in the film. I almost forgot that the singing poet on stage wasn't really Neruda, so well did Domingo capture his affect both in music and in ""figura."" The poignant tragedy of the narrative left Domingo visibly crying during his curtain calls. No applause could be adequate for the character performance of Castronovo as the Little Postman; he's as innocent, as tongue-tied, and as genuinely passionate as the role demands, and he sings as well as his obvious idol Neruda/Domingo.The music! Of course it's the music that matters most, and it's such music as allows both Domingo and Castronovo to soar vocally. The supporting roles, especially the Postman's Beatrice sung by Amanda Squitieri, are acted and sung with equal excellence. There are delightful minor highlights, musically and theatrically, enough to supercharge the central melodrama of this opera. Take note, for instance, of the surprise 'blessing' sung by Mario's Father (Gabriel Osuna); it's a musically authentic Corsican-style chant.All of this is sustained by very capable stage business -- good sets, good costuming, good lighting, etc. -- and excellent camerawork for this DVD. Il Postino is an opera that should find a niche in the scheduling of opera companies around the world for at least the next generation.One painful footnote: composer Daniel Cat&aacute;n died at age 52 in 2011, just months after the LA premiere of Il Postino.",Catan: Il Postino
1183618,"At a glance:""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a film that explores that desire we all have to go back and change how certain events worked out in our lives.  The main character find herself to have this ability, but how did she get it, and what if any complications are brought about by changing things?  The film is another exceptional work by director Mamoru Hosoda, who has been pegged by many to be the director to succeed the great Hayao Miyazaki in directing.  Incredible acting, complimented with great story telling, with vibrant backgrounds and animation make this film a classic that all ages can enjoy.Some details (and spoilers):This film in particular brought about my interest in director Mamoru Hosoda, as he delivered an exceptional film that is easy to recommend to others.  Often times with anime films you really need to consider the content, the genre, and the associated appeal, whereas I don't even consider these when suggesting this film to others.  It has an appeal that exists at different levels, both to younger audiences, as well as older audiences, all the while maintaining a sense of good pacing and timing that keep you genuinely interested in the characters.  The idea of going back in time has unfortunately obtained something of a stigma, but this film goes above that by not using time machines, and not altering world history.  The main character wishes to change the events in her life not out of her desire for greed or power, but for some very relatable reasons that help you to feel empathy toward her and what she is going through.  Ultimately the film begins to address some of the consequences that her actions have had, and you're left feeling as though you gained something from the experience  I found myself enjoying all elements of the film and I didn't have trouble ""getting into it"" or being distracted at points that weren't done correctly.  This film had a lot of love go into it, and I believe that's why many have taken so well to it in return.Pros:* The high definition version is crisp, clear, and really shows off the beautiful palette used for this film.* Voice acting on the dub and sub were both incredibly well done, the emotion of the characters came through, and didn't feel forced.* Bonus features are included with this release on the DVD that comes with it (this does not include the DVD version of the film)* Great story, good pacing, and effective directing establish this film.Cons:* The release is not a DVD/Blu-Ray Combo* The features included are on a DVD rather than a Blu-Ray* While not incredibly expensive, the Blu-Ray is still a little more expensive than maybe it should be for a movie.",N/A

I thought that there were too many possible scenarios in the first film.  In my opinion, it was sort of confusing to me.  I had to watch the Butterfly Effect about three times before I ""got it"".  And, I thought that the presence of Actor Ashton Kutcher would make the film more specious; but, it didn't.  I wasn't bored watching this movie.  But, I couldn't wait for it to end.  Whereas, The Butterfly Effect 2 was interesting and amusing.  Again, the film presented different scenarios of an event; but, the director didn't overdo it .  It was enjoyable.

1205243,I agree with another reviewer and found the lead actress to be completely uninteresting in this role.  When I watch masterpiece theater I expect fantastic acting especially from the lead character and I didn't get it here. However I did enjoy the actor who played Angel and thought he did a fine job.  The story is depressing so without fantastic acting I just didn't see the point of watching. The actress playing Tess says most of her lines in the exact same whiny inflection.  I found myself confused as to whether I should feel sorry for her or annoyed by her.  All in all I'd say it was ok... but not worthy of masterpiece.,Tess of the d'Urbervilles

Many of the actors are more unknown, but extremely talented. Bleak House is an intricate story filled with a lot of Dickens' social commentary and extraordinarily deep and layered characters.

Although we seem to be in the midst of a new golden age of cimena, with brilliant films such as What's my Number and Friends with Benefits hitting the silver screen every matter of months, Jack and Jill has in fact eclipsed these great films only to become possibly the most important film ever made.Like the majority of art films, Jack and Jill has not done well with the critics. This is to be expected as it usually takes a decade or two for these troglodytes to catch up. Works of art such as this film defy genre and as such they are difficult to market.

581520,"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection 0:7 is a single DVD that contains episodes twenty-one through twenty-three of the series.The episodes on this disc provide a lot of backstory and revelations that really shed some light into the Neon Genesis Evangelion universe.  The first episode on this disc contains a lot of flashbacks, and the audience learns about both of Shinji's parents, what happened to Shinji's mother, as well as history of Misato, Ritsuko, and Rei.  In the second episode, Asuka is undergoing a lot of angst, and her synchronization with her Eva unit is dropping.  By the end of that episode, there is a major character shift for Asuka.  The third episode of this disc contains a major revelation concerning Rei.  By the time the final episode on the disc concludes, a number of ""truths"" that have been in the series up until this point have been turned on their head; in fact, my head was nearly spinning by that point.Unlike the previous discs, there were no trailers at the beginning when it started playing in my player.  On the disc, you can choose from four menu options; the options are ""Scene Access,"" ""Communications,"" ""Extras,"" and ""ADV Previews.""  For ""Scene Access,"" you can choose which episode you want to watch on the disc.  ""Communications"" is the option for subtitle and language selections.  For subtitles, you can choose to either have them on or off.  For language, you can choose from English, Spanish, French, and Japanese.The ""Extras"" menu contains three options.  The first is labeled as ""Character Bios""; the bios include a picture of the character and a brief text write-up.  The characters included in this feature are: Shigeru Aoba, Yui Ikari, Naoko Akagi, Fifteenth Angel, and Sixteenth Angel.  The next feature is ""ADV Website""; all this selection does is to take you to a screen that has ADV's website featured on it.  However, since ADV no longer exists, this link is rather irrelevant.  The final extra in this menu is the DVD credits.  The final selection on the main menu is labeled as, ""ADV Previews.""  Like the previous two discs, this one has a menu to choose from instead of automatically starting a long collection of trailers.If you're a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion and haven't either already picked up this DVD release or one of the DVD box sets that were released for the series, this could be worth adding to your DVD library if you can find it for a reasonable price.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this disc that I checked out through the King County Library System.",Neon Genesis Evangelion: Collection 0:7

871525,"I'll tell you 'bout how I became hooked on The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.Thank you for obliging in my attempt to be hip.  Now, let's get jiggy with this review.The first season of many TV shows often shows the series in development--with certain aspects needing tweaking, characters in progress, etc.  Not in this case!  Right from the get-go, The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air reveals what it's all about: wit, positivity, sass, education, family values; you name it, the show's got it!  The pilot episode is the best episode in the season, IMO.  All the characters/actors get to shine equally, and as a viewer, you get a real feel for who they are and what they're all about.  You also get to see and hear the complete music video for the show's theme song--as composed and performed by Will Smith himself.  After the first few episodes in the season/series, the theme song and video would be edited to just over a minute--cutting out the second-, and part of the third verse and introduction.  Still great though!Anyway, Season 1 of The Fresh Prince really focuses on character-actor Will Smith's transition from Philadelphia to California.  While that theme reigned throughout much of the series, Season 1 is all about cultural elements from both geographic areas--and how Will adjusts to one while maintaining the other.  He even schools his family and friends on what life is like on the rough streets--brilliantly, I might add!  His presence at Bel-Air Prep. Academy alongside his cousin Carlton (played by Alfonso Ribeiro) makes for an absolute comedic blast!  Plus, this is the season where Janet Hubert-Whitten (the first actress who played Will's Aunt Vivian Banks, from Season 1-Season 3, before politics unfortunately got in the way and she was let go of her role) gets to bask in the sunlight of her talent as an actress.  For some reason, the writers toned down her character a little bit in Seasons 2 and 3.  But in Season 1, she is raw, hot, and on fire as she delivers one feisty, well-recited, lesson-learned line after another!  You can even get a glimpse into her natural singing talents in episodes like ""The Ethnic Tip""--when she becomes a long-term sub for Will and Carlton's history teacher for Black History Month, and gives her son and nephew a taste of what hard work for something you believe in truly brings.  That's another favorite episode of mine.Other greats include ""Talking Turkey""--when Will's mother, Vy, flies into Bel-Air from Philly for Thanksgiving, and turns the entire Banks household upside down with her opposite (obviously better) work ethic and values for the kids.  EVERY parent should see that episode WITH their children!  When finished watching all episodes, definitely tune into the bonus features.  You'll get great, in-depth interviews from the writers and producers on the development and expansion of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, as well as firsthand eyewitnesses from actors James Avery (Uncle Phil), Joseph Marcell (Geoffrey the Butler), Tatyana M. Ali (Ashley Banks), and Karen Parsons (Hillary Banks).  Plus, you'll learn about the background of the hilarious Jazz (played by DJ Jazzy Jeff, Will Smith's musical sidekick on the show, and in real life prior to its creation) and his routine tosses out of the house by Uncle Phil.  LOL!!!All in all, Season 1 proves that Will Smith, the supporting cast, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air as a complete TV show are worth more money than gold!  Although I, personally, have yet to see the entire series (I haven't watched any episodes from Season 6, the final season, and have just begun viewing and getting a kick out of Season 3), I would have to declare Season 1 as being my favorite of the bunch.  One episode (any one) therein, and you'll be hooked for life!  Check it out!!!!!!!  :D",N/A

This blu ray disc reproduced some of the beautiful scenes e.g. in the forest but failed to tone down the makeup which made all men wore red lipsticks.  22 years on, the film now looks a bit flashy with a hollow center.  It is mainly due to the lacking of deeper explorations or descriptions of the 3 main charactors, the 2 gangsters and Gabriel Byrne's charactor, critically the latter.  How good a right hand man was he?  Why was he so like by his boss, even after he betrayed him?  Was he really heartless or souless?  Are they simply small time hoods?  It is all very ambiguous.  For these reasons, it is not a fully satisfying period crime film.",Miller's Crossing VHS
669150,"I guess I don't know a good zombie movie from a bad one because I totally don't get all the criticisms this movie has received over the years.  Over 50 1-star reviews here on amazon?  Really?  Maybe it's because I'm a total Resident Evil geek.  I believe Resident Evil 2 and 3 are some of the best video games on the Playstation.  This movie actually resembles the slow-moving, suspenseful build-up in the storyline, scenery AND zombie movements of that classic video game series.  I wasn't expecting anything approaching that given the assortment of negative feelings here on amazon.Children of Living Dead begins with an arrogant and athletic man out in the field of some no name town and he's totally unafraid of the zombies around him.  He frequently opens fire and takes out all the zombies in the surrounding area.  He even gets creative by pushing a car down a hill, having the zombies walk up to it, then shoots and blows the vehicle up, haha.  Well everything goes fine until he enters the upstairs of a barn and stumbles upon a SUPER zombie that can't be killed like the other ones.  Upon opening fire the zombie continues forward and takes the man out!  Luckily all the children hiding in the barn make it safely outside due to a police officer being around.  Thank goodness he was there!  Of course... well, the kids aren't so lucky after all.  You'll see what I mean.I really like the scenery.  Everything is really dark and gloomy and it actually perfectly captures a zombie infested area.  The film is presented beautifully.The reason I'm taking away two stars is because, for one thing, the ending is just *terrible*.  No suspense or really satisfying conclusion to speak of.  The movie just ENDS and that's it.  Huh?  And two, the entire segment with the graveyard and digging up the caskets wasn't properly written.  I mean the bulldozers that were planning to build a parking lot for a car dealership would occasionally tip over a casket and everyone would stop working to check out what's inside.  This whole scene felt like it lacked serious potential for suspense.  Or perhaps the writers shouldn't have wasted so much time on this graveyard segment since nothing memorable or conclusive ever came out of it anyway.  It was overlong and pointless.So yeah, an undeveloped storyline overall, but the believable zombie movements and presentation is actually REALLY surprisingly good.

It's an unsparing look at racism, put forth before Martin Luther King had a dream, and before the Civil Rights Act.  A classic, and an essential film.The 50th anniversary repackaging is terrific -- it includes a Blu-Ray with a stunning picture and good sound, a standard def DVD, a downloadable digital copy which looks great on my MacBook and iPad, and a batch of nice extras.

And the booklet has essays by Peck's wife Veronique, by Harper Lee, and -- this is especially nifty for actors out there -- reproductions of three pages of Peck's personal copy of the shooting script, with his dense annotations, edits, and notes which show the prodigious work that went into this remarkably low-key, understated performance.  it's revelatory to watch the scenes in question with the script in front of you.

574192,"Blue Underground's disc contains both the US and the 3-minute longer International versions of the film A Bullet for the General. These are separate 1080P transfers and NOT seamlessly branched - sharing the same Blu-ray disc.  There may be some very slight differences in the image quality between the two versions but it won't be a lot - if any at all. I've made a couple of comparison captures below. The transfer seems a little inconsistent with some sequences showing that nice sheen of grain we often see with Blue Underground but there are a few spots that look waxy - as if DNR were the culprit. This wasn't at all egregious and I'd say that overall the visuals are extremely impressive with great detail in close-ups and depth being displayed. Colors are bright with true skin tones. The 2.35:1 widescreen is used in a slick fashion and the the video comes across pleasing throughout most of the presentation.The US version offers a healthy DTS-HD Master 2.0 channel at 1906 kbps that is comparable to the DUB on the International version that also has the option of lossless Italian at equally as robust a transfer. Gunshots are piercing and the aggressive pats of the soundtrack seems easily handled by the uncompressed audio. The flatness is expected. We have an original score by Luis Bacalov and the iconic Ennio Morricone that supports the 'Spaghetti' aspects very well. There are optional subtitles - both English (SDH) and English - for the Italian version - as well as French and Spanish.

This is nothing more than an excrutiatingly painful ripoff of When a Stranger Calls (Even the title sucks like a hoover), there aren't enough words to describe it's total suckiness.If you like a pointlessly bad slasher flick that involves the butchering of children, a psycho who's got the hots for a girl who doesn't like him, and like lots of unnecessary gore all around, have at it.  I don't think these movies need to be this graphic and disgusting to be entertaining but, then again, this one doesn't have a leg to stand on in that department either.  Terrible acting, a bad script, lousy effects, and sorry, but Rebekah Kochan is not that hot looking.  All this movie is is an exercise in disturbing images and lots of irritating screaming.  To say I hated every moment of this piece of crud is an understatement.  You can spend 90-some minutes of your time doing something more productive...like cleaning dog crap off the lawn.",N/A
1493936,"Being one of those low budget independent movies, only those who purposely seek these things out with some hatred towards Hollywood movies will brag on and on about how this is supposed to be an ingenious masterpeice. Well, the director should have taken some tips from those Hollyweed movies and given this one here a much faster pace instead of boring you to tears for the most part.The plot is rather interesting tho, a 19 year old girl hears on the radio that a new star has just been found in the sky that may be able to support life. As she looks in the sky while driving (drunk I think) she crashes her car into a family of 3. She goes to prison for 4 years and when she is released, she seeks out the man who survived the crash, but lost his wife and young child in the process. He has no idea who she is when she knocks on his door, but instead of saying what she wanted, she tells him she is a cleaner and he hires her to clean his house. They end up falling in love but she doesn't want to proceed with the relationship because she has not told him the truth. All while this is happening, the discovery of the new star is discovered to be another Earth that they call Earth II. There is a contest online for someone to win a trip on a shuttle to go and visit the planet, and the main actresses dream is to go and explore space, or the new planet where scientists have discovered Earth II is a planet where everyone on Earth I had a double, where everything had been the exact same events on both Earths until the time of discovering each other, 4 years before hand when it was first announced.You can probably already guess how this movie ends. It is fairly predictable. But seeing through the idea of trying to gain interest in some sort of Sci-Fi idea of two planets, it's more of a story of a woman who causes a tragic accident, meets the man she killed the wife and kid of,accidentally gets involved with him, and their sad/depressed lives change them into more happier people... and then, later, you can probably predict what happens in the end.To me tho, the premise and story are far more interesting then actually having to sit through this. For the most part, I was bored and yawning while my girlfriend told me to shut-up and hope it gets better. It doesn't. There is no pace, it drags on, there is no fun, comedy or anything really of any entertainment value. It's also one of those movies that must not have run long enough to call it a full length one, so inserted is a bunch of useless scenes that are not needed to do anything other then make the movie seem longer. I wanted to bleach my own eyes having to sit through that useless dribble of filler. My girlfriend was loving the cheaply made CGI scenes of Earths sky showing another Earth in the sky like the moon, but I have seen it done before, and much better, and was not at all impressed by it.I can definitely see other people enjoying this movie, for various reasons, but for people like me who like something about a movie to be memorable, or something that makes a movie burn into your mind and make you remember it, this movie just failed to leave me with anything other then feelings of being bored and wanting to reach for the skip button, fast forward, or the off switch.So, keep in mind, this is one of those independent movies that people praise because it's not half as bad as most indie-films and it seems artsy-fartsy enough to be praised by someone who would turn their nose up at average entertainment movies because they are given more of a budget to work with then these kind of films and would rather support blah blah blah blah... you know the story, it's too boring to keep going on with.I'd rather have read this as a book than watched it, it really did show scenes of this girl standing still for a few minutes, while you guess what is going through her head, she may as well have had a voice over saying things like ""I saw the dust on the bench projecting a light yellow as the setting sun dripped through the old stain glass windows that didn't look like they had been washed since Bill Clinton last slept with his wife and didn't think of some other, more youthful, woman's melons that had no wrinkles or a stench of Rosie O'Donnell's breath attached to them"".Also, if you are expecting this to be a sci-fi movie, guess again. It's a drama, the Earth II thing could easily be taken out and this would still be the same story, just with an alternate ending, possibly a thriller, which would have been more entertaining if you ask me.See it if it interests you, but I really wouldn't expect too much from it if you think it's going to be absolutely brilliant.",N/A

1339882,"I recently had a debate with a friend about the Swedish filmLet the Right One In (English Subtitled)vs. ""Let Me In.""  We had both seen ""Let the Right One In"" and loved it.  Such a beautifully made movie, and my heart just breaks for Eli and Oskar.  I couldn't get the movie out of my head, and I read many reviews of the film, just to learn others' perspectives.  Of course, I read the bookLet Me Inthat preceded the movie.  All of it helped me to better appreciate Let the Right One In.  This was why I was excited to learn that an American version would be made.  When discussing this with my friend, he was horrified that there would be a remake, and thought that it was an insult to the Swedish film.What a challenge for Matt Reeves, the director, to make his version of a film that was beloved by audiences around the world.  The essence of the story remains the same: a young boy, Owen, is horribly bullied by classmates at school, and he's neglected by his single mother at home.  When Abby moves into his apartment complex, Owen finds a kindred spirit - a young girl who seems every bit as lonely as he is.  She promises Owen she will protect him, and by the end of the film, she certainly fulfills that promise.  When Owen learns her secret, and when Abby's own life is at risk, he returns the favor.Chloe Grace Moretz as Abby is fantastic.  She had already proven her ability to play a strong, young girl inKick-Ass.  There are scenes that made my heart race (especially the car scene.)  I thought the rearranging of the chronology of several scenes worked well, although I wondered if Reeves' main intention of this was to differentiate himself.  It's an excellent movie that deserves to be seen.  Overall, though, Let the Right One In is the superior movie, and it has nothing to do with the fact that it came first.",N/A
82432,"Watching 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' for the first time in 20 years, and the first time as an adult, I was surprised at how well the film holds up.  It's full of easily relatable, but genuinely charming, humor and gorgeous hand drawn animation.  For long-time fans, I'm probably not tell you anything new, but if, like me, you have not seen the film in years, please check it out.Also, its easy to share with your grandma on her tube tv.  The blu-ray includes 'Disneyvision' a process that features the film in a full frame aspect, but instead of hearing granny complain about the 'black lines on the screen!', the unused screen space is filled with beautiful framing, complimenting each scene.  For example, there may be pillars in the castle, or trees and vines framing a forest scene.  A very nice touch.  After a few minutes, the framing melded with the animation and felt like a wonderful addition.  I watched it on a widescreen television, but wanted to check out this new feature.A gem to share with younger generations as well as old time fans.",N/A

First, if you have Netflix, it's free. If not, pay whatever it costs to rent. Maybe even consider buying it because you will want to watch it again and again.I am very picky when it comes to movies. If they aren't 4 stars, they better be pretty close or else I don't want to watch it. Mighty Macs is a movie that you alone or with family will love. To make it even better, it is based on a true story.Mighty Macs is Hoosiers for girls. It's a true story of how a born-to-be basketball coach, finds a desperate girls school in need of everything, and pulls up everyone's bootstraps to victory. The movie is filled with inspiration, excitement, drama and love.I don't want to bore with yet another review that goes into great detail about the plot and characters.

1454523,"Jeff Dunham has become one of my very favorite comedians of all time.  Yes, even though he is rightly thought of as a ventriloquist, it is his great COMEDIC talents that stand out to me.  That is not to minimize his talents as a ventriloquist, as technically he is very, very impressive here too.  Dunham's interactions with his puppets are so complex and realistic that Peanut, Achmed and company really seem to come to life in his hands!  In this show, my 2nd favorite Dunham DVD next to 'Spark of Insanity', he is on a real roll for basically the whole show!  (Any mistakes are redone and edited out, so the whole show flows seamlessly).  His humor is adult, but he is not excessively crude.  Jeff's interactions with the audience are quite amusing.  Dunham's humor would normally be considered offensive, but is not really perceived as such, since it is his dummies who make the offending remarks.  Interesting is how politically incorrect the humor often is, but he gets away with it because it seems like it is the puppets who make the non-PC jokes while Jeff gets 'upset' at them and apologizes for 'their' bad behavior.  Fascinating, as if a regular comedian made some of the same jokes, he/she would likely get booed off the stage, while Jeff's puppets get riotous laughter.  Anyway, if you enjoy great humor and fine ventriloquism, you will love this DVD.  Picture and sound quality are both impressive.  Extras are not especially great, but that's not a big issue for me.",N/A

I've been a Jack Ketchum fan since 1981 when I read his novel Offseason, along with Richard Laymon's The Cellar, and thought, ""at last, this is what real horror fiction should be"".It's good to see films of his works. Red was very well done and Off Spring (the sequel to Offseason) was good. The Woman is better. Psychological terror at its best.Pollyanna McIntosh is amazing as the feral woman. My wife, a costumer, immediately noticed her walk: like a beast, not a woman (or man). Her full-body makeup should earn an Oscar, as well as her acting. Angela Bettis, as the broken-down wife, was also outstanding, and Sean Bridgers, as her sadistic, psychotic husband, had just the right amount of quiet lunacy to carry off the role. It's good to see Sean in a starring role; he's worked hard for it.The only complaint I had was that some of the music was too LOUD (it distracted form the script) and some of the lyrics had no relation to the action. I've always believed the music should further the action, or strengthen it (The Big Chill).There was one very gross moment early, that made my wife turn away, but that I thought was the sexiest, most sensual, eating scene since Tom Jones. Look at the woman's expression while she chews....Highly recommended, as is the book by the same name.",N/A

Well, after seeing the first episode, I wasn't thrilled.  It is somewhat flat without Charlie.  I still watch it, probably because TV programing is so very very sad these days.

The bad guys were okay, but just did not radiate the cool calm evil that Hans did in Die Hard.

914724,"The true translation of the Italian title would be ""God's Jester.""  The Crterion version is the complete 89 minute run (in the USA in 1950 it was released at 75 minutes).The ancient books upon which ""Flowers of St. Francis"" is based are mostly fantastic stories of Francesco and the early Franciscans; they are not rigorous biography.  Rosselini didn't want to focus on St. Francis but instead on how Francis' teachings were absorbed by others - especially the uneducated countryfolk who were his Franciscans. The movie is a stream of parables. The actors are mostly non-actors.Rosselini wrote: ""I never meant to re-create the life of the saint ... I don't deal with either his birth or his death ... I have given particular emphasis to Brother Ginapro and Brother Giovanni, who display in an almost paradoxical way the sense of simplicity, innocence, and delight that emanates from Francis' own spirit. In short, as the title indicates, my film wants to focus on the merrier aspect of the Franciscan experience, on the playfulness, the 'perfect delight', the freedom the spirit finds in poverty and in an absolute detachment from material things.""Rosselini also refers to ""the perfume of the most primitive Franciscanism.""",The Flowers of St. Francis

I think that's about the most you can expect from any drama: to feel something.This is very much an indie film with an indie budget. It's also every bit a postmodern tale, so some plot points aren't fully explained. As another reviewer noted, the ending is a bit nebulous; it's the least satisfying part of the tale. The good thing about nebulous endings, though, is that you can decide for yourself what happened. In that regard, it reminds me of the infamous final episode of ""The Sopranos,"" which was sort of a Rorschach test; viewers had to interpret it for themselves.I won't recount the plot, as others here have done that, but I will say that the lead -- who also wrote and directed -- was the strongest member of the cast. Other characters weren't fully realized, which could be a flaw or a device to keep the main narrative on track.All in all, though, I found it an effective and thoughtful movie.

It's obvious that it was intended to be quirky. And it was, along with some laugh-out-loud moments, moving scenes that bring back fun childhood memories no matter what decade one grew up in, mixed with some truly bizarre situations, some of which are too far fetched to be believable.

Only one 'big' fight scene of two boys struggling with one being punched in the sides, lasts for only a moment as the aim in that scene is not to fight each other. Views showing/dialog of weapons, none of which you see actually being used - although you see the after affects of two of them (bloody craft scissors, and an injured/dead animal).

Can Murph convince Mickey's parents to allow their son the chance of a lifetime? And if Mickey's parents do agree, how will Mickey fit in with the rest of the team? How will he adapt to life away from his family's farm - the only life he's ever known?This movie has wonderful discussion points including the topics of faith, loyalty, friendship, never giving up,  envy, mistreatment of others because they are different, grief, worry, and telling the truth.A word of caution to those with young children: there is a brief scene at a party where Mickey is injured that will scare younger viewers.Beautiful scenery, an inspiring story line based on a true story, and a well-rounded family movie make this a must-see. I highly recommend adding it to your list for your family's next movie night! I have added this movie to my list of mom-approved movies on my wordpress blog.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of ""McKenzie.""",Mile in His Shoes

999042,So I have to tell you my name is Earl is one my favorite TV shows of all times I'm now watching seasons 1 and 2 for the 2nd time and Earl's brother Randy just says some of the funniest things I've ever heard when he mixes up what a word means or he desires to lick the blue powder from Earl's because he loves the blue is just comic gold.If you don't know the show's premise it revolves around Earl and his struggle to appease karma and be a better person. In each episode he goes after one person on this master list is written down that include many of the things he did that he is not proud of when he was a child and young adult and grown man. And each episode you will find follows the same sort of premise and pattern. Not to the shows fault sometimes it gets old and repetitive but I think the characters especially Randy and Crab Man add to the funny humor of Earl and it seriously just can consistently be enjoyable.One thing I realized is this show really raised the bar for camo appearances by older actors & actresses.  It really is fun to even see future stars make their appearances (Chlo Grace Moretz).  I think it adds to the comedy of it.Now I didn't really like seasons 3 and 4 from what I remember watching them 3 years ago so this is my 2nd watch through and I will update this at my feelings change but I felt in the past the repetition just got old but seasons 1 and 2 are just epic awesome television. And one thing I like about the show is it doesn't force Karma down your throat in a preachy way as many of the other characters don't accept the karma but still enjoy helping Earl in his quest to be a better person. This showed just works.  And that is why I gave it 5 stars even if I didn't totally love the final seasons.Another thing is the after show - bed room conversations are soooo funny I don't laugh out loud at comedy much but these have me rolling on the floor laughing out loud... for real.I hope you enjoy it and either watching it free streaming because I have Amazon prime and if you're going to purchase it I say just purchase Amazon prime for $80 a year at my $.02,N/A
403238,"Charles Laughton shows his talent in this great old black & white movie (which also brought Maureen O'Hara into our movie legends). Laughton had lots of make-up & limited dialogue to work with but was able to show the heart, soul, & pathos that was Quasimoto. The youngsters today would benefit from seing this ""old"" film that is really a CLASSIC. Charles Laughton is often remembered as Henry the VIII in ""Young Bess"" (& he was terrific in that role, too) because it was a color film spectacular but ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" should not be overlooked as one of his best films!",N/A

1378923,"Remarkably unfunny comedy about shallow, commitment-phobic gay guy David who suddenly realizes he is forty and doesn't want to be alone.  So he invites three of his equally shallow, commitment-phobic gay friends for a late summer pool party, where they frolic by the poolside, splash in the water and talk about sex (eagerly) and commitment (scathingly).  Of course their fun is interrupted by all sorts of zany characters:  nosy neighbors, interfering mothers, pizza delivery boys, obnoxious sisters and pre-pubescent nephews.  A sorrier bunch of men, make that children, never existed.  The best line comes when David gives his nephew some sage advice:  ""Don't be in a hurry to grow up.""  That pretty much sums up David and his friends.A movie doesn't necessarily need characters you care about, but it should have characters you're interested in, and this one doesn't.  Comedies don't need much of a plot, but they should be funny, or at least amusing.  If you're into watching marginally good-looking guys in swimsuits played by bad actors, reciting bad dialogue, then ""Pooltime"" is the movie for you.

1534253,"----------------------------------------Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------**Brief Review of Film**Bought this from FYE last week.  My copy came with a full sized poster as well!!!  14.99 for the price, a fair amount in my opinion.  12.99 would have been better.  Anywho...I had some concerns with this film even before I popped it into my aging DVD player.  Number one, for a long while the listed run time of this film was like 57 minutes.  NOT EVEN AN HOUR!!!  Well, DC seems to have fixed this and added in some more footage, bringing the elapsed time to 74 minutes, better but still not perfect.I was also concerned about Superman having the chin of Jay Leno.  I know he's supposed to have a chiseled jaw, but come on.  Well, you get used to his unique appearance after about 10 minutes, so this is not a big deal either.**Some Spoilers Ahead**The film centers around Superman and his encounter with The Elite.  The Elite are a group of fledging superheros who want to fight the bad guys as well.  The only difference is they don't take prisoners, they down right KILL the bad guys.This film really does delve into the philosphy of most superheroes.  Pummel the villians and send them to prison.  They break out, kill more people and cause even more damage, the good guys beat them up again and re-send them to prison, where they break out again...  The point being is that if you simply ended them, you would be sparing many people a lot of potential suffering.  This concept is one we face here in real life.  People to this day argue over the death penalty, is assassinating terrorists right, etc.  This animated movie is kind of like our current times meets a comic strip, and it's not funny in the least.Should bad people just be killed, no trial, no jurys?  The Elite certainly think so.  Of course Superman is appauled by this and wants them to turn themselves in to be judged for their crimes.  Here's the funny part, we the people are fine with The Elite killing, in fact we applaud them for it.  Just as people stormed the White House fence and cheered for hours after Osama Bin Laden was executed, people cheer for The Elite after they bring down villians.Eventually Superman and The Elite come to a show-down.  How can Superman (who doesn't kill) stand a chance against an entire team of ""superheroes"" who do it like it was breathing?--Pros Of Movie--Good thought provoking story/premise.  Some characters I've never seen before.  Film shows the pros/cons of both Superman's methods of justice AND the Elite's.--Cons Of Movie--Superman is not very powerful in this movie.  He gets his ass kicked pretty well and bleeds quite a bit.  He's missing his left eyelids at the end of the movie for crying out loud!!!  While violence and blood are not bad things in cinema, I am not used to seeing Superman this beat up.Back stories of The Elite are not delved into enough.  In fact only Manchester Black gets his back story looked into, and briefly at that.  How did the rest of the team get their powers?Film is too short.  Not enough time to hash things out.Also animation was a bit crude for my taste, not worthy of being labeled film quality.--In Conclusion--Overall a great film, not perfect, but still really good.  I will definitely be watching this again soon.  A film that not only delivers punches, but makes you wonder as well, wonder about what really is the right way to handle evil.Also, FYI there is a bonus feature.  A featurette that gives you a preview of DC's next release.  They are bringing 'Return of the Dark Knight' to film!!!  Peter Weller (Robot Cop) is voicing the aging Batman!!!  The movie is going to be released in 2 parts, meaning it will not be light on content!!!  Fall 2012 is the apx release for Part 1.  I can't wait, I am shoving money into my PC's disk drive right now, trying to reserve myself a copy.  Good things on the horizon for us the fanboys...Only one last gripe with DC Comics.  I love 'Batman' & 'Superman' as much as the next guy or gal, but come on, you've got other characters.  You have other wells to tap into.  Is it too much to ask for a 'Deadman' animated movie?  How about 'Etrigan The Demon'?  The 'Spectre'?  Give us something fresh and new, PLEASE!!!All right, I'm off my soap box now.  Now go check out 'Superman Vs The Elite'.",N/A

1211910,"""The Avengers"" delivers on the promise of the other Marvel films with a rip-roaring adventure filled with snappy dialogue, good performances, great action sequences and terrific visual effects that supports a well written, directed story from Joss Whedon.Should you see it in 3D? The film was shot with 3D in mind so a number of scenes benefit from it but, quite honestly, it would work just as well as a regular theatrical presentation. Since I don't have the Blu-ray 3D I can't review that aspect but I can review the two disc Blu-ray/DVD combo.Image & Sound: A top notch Blu-ray transfer with deep, rich blacks, nice detail, depth and bold colors, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" looks and sound brilliant. The Lossless soundtrack is audio demo quality with excellent use of the surround speakers, detail and, again, imaging/depth. Dialogue is always to the forefront where it's needed to be.Subtitles are provided in English as well as providing descriptive services for the blind.The special features are good but a bit disappointing in that there aren't more of them covering the details I was interested in. I would have loved to see a special feature on the comic book, it's evolution and a discussion with Joss Whedon as to why he chose this line up (which isn't quite the original as in the original 1960's comic book). It also would have been nice to provide some of the vintage comic books in a digital format as an example of the story elements that Whedon borrowed for the film (including the reboot of Nick Fury since originally he looked nothing like Samuel L. Jackson and was revised to look like the actor--a bit of irony considering that he wasn't offered the role until a decade later).We do get two fine featurettes that provide us with behind-the-scenes footage, talking heads discussing what attracted them to the film/roles. Whedon is as always effusive and entertaining particularly during the commentary track where he discusses the decision to shoot the film without a 3D rig and do a post conversion (he shares his experience with shooting the tag at the end of ""Thor"" in 3D which was added to that film to set up this film). He also discusses his approach to the characters and the mission that Marvel gave him in making the film.Deleted/extended scenes are an interesting addition. We get an alternate opening and closing for the film both of which involve Cobie Smulders' character giving her a larger role in the film. This footage was wisely excised in my opinion. We also get footage of Captain America brooding over Peggy and although interesting it would have been far more interesting to see him actually go and try and meet her (although they would have to figure out a way to tie it into the larger narrative). (SPOILER) There are also extended scenes including a scene between Loki and Hawkeye where the latter gives Loki the information that sends him on his mission to disrupt The Avengers. That little scene explains how he knew what he was doing would break the team apart but it also would have spoiled us discovering what his true purpose was in allowing himself to be captured. (END OF SPOILER).Finally we get a gag reel and trailers for other films. I'm sure there are probably Easter eggs but I haven't discovered them yet on the Blu-ray.The DVD comes with one featurette and the commentary track.Oh, and make sure to stick around post-credits for an amusing scene involving the heroes doing something Tony Stark suggests earlier at the conclusion of the film. Notice that Captain America's face is blocked by his hand. That's because the scene was shot after completion of shooting and Chris Evans was growing a beard for his next role.SPOILERS:When an intergalactic threat spearheaded by Loki (Tom Hiddleston)to obtain the mysterious and powerful Cosmic Cube (a major plot point in ""Captain America"" and seen, briefly, in ""Thor"") arises, Agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)is forced to call together a dysfunction team of superheroes--Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and, later, Thor (Chris Hemsworth)to battle Loki and get the Cosmic Cube back before Loki can obtain his objective--to open a portal for an invading alien army.Eventually the team gets past their dislike of each other/rivalry to work as a team.  They may not like each other but they each have a role to play and embrace it. Stick around past the initial credits for a surprise cameo from a well known Marvel villian named Thanos (if you don't know who he is--look him up. He appears in a number of Marvel comics at various times and his character IS tied to the Cosmic Cube so Whedon does a good job of combining elements of the first issue of ""The Avengers"" with later comics).END OF SPOILERS:Joss Whedon has done a terrific job of assembling the Avengers (pun intended) for their first big screen adventure. The film is filled with strong action sequences that are both well designed and executed. The continuity between ""The Avengers"" and the previous Marvel films (""Captain America"", ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Iron Man 2"" and ""Thor"")is well established and continued here (it helps that Whedon did an uncredited rewrite on ""Captain America"" and even worked on Ang Lee's much disliked ""Hulk"" plus Whedon is a passionate fan of the Marvel comic books).Are there flaws? Well, sure just about every movie has one flaw or another. There are some plot coincidences, holes that will bother those who are picky about that stuff but what matters here (at least to me...your mileage may vary)is the flow and how well put together the story is. You can pick apart just about ANY movie.Recommended.",Marvel's: The Avengers
1283954,"Overall, a good movie that features some interesting history on the Hoover's ""G-men"" and crime in the 1930's during the Great Depression.  However, it missed the mark in telling and showing a captivating story, which is unfortunate.This isn't a family or date movie, unless you're into violence and lots of gun fire and dead bodies.The story follows the infamous bank robber John Dillinger and his gang through numerous bank jobs and escapes from lock-up. In contrast, the story also follows Hoover and his recruitment of a the new head of the Chicago FBI office, as they tighten the net on Dillinger.Obviously a great cast, set design, and wardrobe. Action scenes could have been better. Where this movie fell flat, is in the story. I wasn't captivated by either of the story's main characters. Sure, okay, they were interesting. But I wasn't drawn into their lives, like I should have been, especially with a story that has at its side, such rich history to pull from.And I'm not sure, how the directing pulled me into the story or characters either.Other then the historical aspect, I'm not sure I would buy this movie for my collection.",Public Enemies

But I will say that the acting is simply superb -- particularly Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, as the coming-together thirty-somethings with a shared disheveled past and an emotional steamer trunk full of similar disconnects.  (DeNiro goes without saying.)  The way in which these real people connect their loose wires is a testament both to the author and to the director (David Russell) of this comic tale of human interaction.  You will long remember the characters and you will never forget the story.  This film is an example of what Hollywood can do well but unfortunately does far less frequently now by sacrificing the stories of real people on the altar of special effects, morphing and extended adolescent superhero nonsense.

197680,"This has been a long time coming but we now finally have Chaplin's 1925 original release in a form that does justice to what many feel is his masterpiece. Kevin Brownlow and the late David Gill have worked many years on gathering the material from archives and collectors that would allow for a decent reconstruction of THE GOLD RUSH as it was originally shown. In 1942 Chaplin prepared a sound release in which he removed the titles, added a delightful narration that he spoke himself (at least in the English language release) and composed a music score that is perfect for the film. In doing so he went back to his vaults and chose different takes that played better at the 24fps sound speed. In the process the original 1925 negative was partly used and the sound version became the version that Chaplin preferred. In 1942 audiences were delighted with the new approach as films from the silent era as a rule were not being reissued. Over the years interest in silent films has made a come back and there are many who regret not being able to enjoy THE GOLD RUSH as it was original shown. Now on the Criterion release we have a beautifully restored copy of both releases. Criterion has gone the extra mile with the 1925 version and removed scratches and dirt so that the film looks the best it has since its original release. Now thorough the efforts of Timothy Brock, who has reconstructed Chaplin's music from the 1942 release, we can watch the film with the music that it should be heard with. With the excellent extras, booklet and restoration there is no question that the Criterion release is one of the most important releases ever. While the Blu-ray is marvelous the DVD release will also be a big improvement over any previous release. And even if you are not a fan of the 1942 release you can use this version to introduce younger children (who do not yet read well enough for silent titles) to the art of Chaplin. I've done this and their response is wonderful. And yes there are some differences between the two releases. Take a look at the letter Georgia Hale writes after not showing up for the New Year's dinner that Charlie has worked so hard to prepare. And for my money the ending of the film works far better in the 1925 release. Judge for yourself.",The Gold Rush
1506311,I give credit to the crew that made this movie as they tried to stay as faithful to the JC universe as they could.I felt they needed to flesh out the characters better and make them more interesting.  It was difficult to tell one from the other.  Other than the lead character we never got to know them and never cared if they lived or died.  In JC's version you knew who was who even with the limited time each character had.The CGI also wasn't the greatest but the 1982 version puppets doesn't hold up well today so CGI is where we are at.  Unfortunately this movie didn't have a Lord Of The Rings type of budget to make that CGI look real.Overall it's a nice little companion piece to JC's movie.  If you are a fan of the 82 version this is worth a rental.,N/A

Some gratuitous(and period inappropriate)nudity but overall I think Spike Lee conveyed that period quite well. Overall an engaging and entertaining story. Don't believe it warrants all those one star reviews, which seem eerily similar to those on ""Red Tails"" movie review sites.

223719,"Ordinary People is an extraordinary film and is almost certainly the best movie ever which deals with the break down of an American family.  The ordinary people of the title are not ordinary - they are a highly affluent family, but who suffer the loss of a favorite child.  Their affluence does not shield them from the all to ordinary consequences of this tragedy.There is nothing ordinary about this film from Robert Redford's steller direction to the suburb acting of the family - the father Donald Sutherland, the mother Mary Tyler Moore and the surviving son Timothy Hutton.  Special kudos must be given to Mary Tyler Moore whose cold, unsympathetic portrayal of the mother, in complete contrast to her spunky TV roles in the Mary Tyler Moore Show and the Dick van Dyke Show, is a performance for the ages (how she could have lost the Academy Award for Best Actress to Sissy Spacek for The Coal Minor's Daughter is mind boggling).  The supporting roles of Judd Hirsh (another dramatic turn for a comedic TV actor from Taxi) and Elizabeth McGovern, in her first film role (the mother from Downton Abbey) are equally brilliant.There is not a false note in this movie from the opening panoramic view of the location to the very personal bittersweet ending.

1492281,"Boardwalk Empire had an interesting premise and some good historical material to mine. It worked ok for the first season. But as the second season went on, it became clear that the premise had been played out. The setting and the characters had been used up. And there was nowhere to go but down.The first major problem was that the show degenerated into ""Good Irish Wife Playhouse"". This is a gangster drama. Most people (including me) want to see gangster drama rather than the overblown domestic trials and tribulations of I dont know how many ""good"" Irish wives in the cast. And because its Good Irish Wife playhouse, we have to treat the death of her wifebeating, baby-killing drunken husband Hans as great crime. Somehow nobody makes the point that killing a guy who beats his pregnant wife up in they way he did can be seen more as a sort of rough justice rather than a moral crime. I'm not sure anyone even bothers to make the point about what sort of guy Hans was.About halfway through the season, they seemed to realize that the plot had run out. So they started killing and/or wrecking every character in the cast. By the end of the season, almost everyone but Thompson (and wife) was dead. Every episode seemed to require a shocking death or a shocking betrayal that often made little sense and were worse yet, against the actual history.The real Commodore lived to 1934. Yet in the show he is killed in the early 1920s to provide more mixed up family drama leading to the death of another character. The Commodore was an important character to the show because he provided the bridge between the political machine and the business community.The show also fails to understand the rules of a 1920s political machine. Gangsters were not going to openly kill high-profile businessmen or senior politicians without consequences. Especially a low-level gangster in Atlantic City. The show also doesn't understand that the local political machine fits into a bigger state-level machine with its own priorities.The show also ignores the democratic party in terms of how things got done in that era. The democratic party (who controlled the statehouse at the time) would have been leading the charge to get members of the atlantic city machine. And the democratic machine would have existed in parallel with the republican machine. Working with gangsters in New York or other east coast cities would require political negotiations as well as negotiations with gangsters. Disputes between gangsters turn into disputes between politicians. The writers just don't understand and don't care much about how the era really worked.By the end of the second season, everyone is dead and the show seems to have nowhere left to go. Its been renewed for a third season. But what that will consist of is unclear. They can either abandon history or they can repeat themselves.Steve Buscemi does an outstanding job in the lead role. He is the only person associated with this program who deserves awards. Its just a pity that the writers are not up to creating better material for him to play.",Boardwalk Empire: Season 2

What I do know is that it's along, boring and just full of uninsipred and no fun material.York gets a paycheque for slapping his name on a musketeer film, Depardieu does the same, and what's her name struts her stuff as a machismo female in training.I guess the one advantage this thing has is that it was actually shot in France, unlike the previous films, which were shot in Spain.

1349257,"The Next Three Days eschews the conventional thriller storyline to show a desperate man taking desperate measures.  Anti-hero Russell Crowe - now looking podgy for some reason (ala State of Play) - actually looks a little unhinged or deranged in this film while taking on the mission of a lifetime.  He's convincing in many ways, but the film might have worked better without a celebrity.  Having Russell in the driver's seat detracted from the suspense.  Maybe he's too familiar to us.  (Interesting that Amazon lists Liam Neeson's films alongside this - both Taken and Unknown are riveting - and Liam makes a cameo here, almost blowing away Russell Crowe IMHO).To the film's credit, we never quite know where it's heading - will he make it?  Will they make it?  Won't they?  So The Next Three Days avoids the pitfalls of cliche in many ways.  Definitely watchable.  Just didn't press all the buttons for me.",The Next Three Days

1137725,"Ok, so this isn't some sort of cinematic art or big special effects extravaganza. Why people are reviewing this negatively because of the two stars, makes no sense to me. Since when do people expect much from Matthew McConaughey or Kate Hudson? Kate was really good in Almost Famous, but other than that I haven't been blown away by her or Matthew for that matter, in fact, I can't even think of him ever not playing some dolt without his accent. This movie harkens back to something like Overboard with its chemistry of two stars who would seem like an odd pair from different walks of life. While Matthew is no Kurt Russell, I think Kate is better than her mother ever was. So these two have pretty good chemistry together and then you shoot this movie in the best parts of Australia with great actors like Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart and Donald Sutherland and make it an adventure film, then you've got something really good. The movie is paced well, shot well and it looks great on Blu-Ray. Poor supplemental features, but I bought this for the movie so I'm not too bummed about the lack of extras. If you like adventure films and video games, you'll probably like this. I am a big fan of the video game series Uncharted, this movie reminds me of that series only not as funny or dangerous, but this movie is still witty and adventurous.

811597,"This is a quite nice little war movie about a group of American fighter pilots during Korean War. It is an adaptation of a novel, ""The Hunters"" by James Salter. I admit that I didn't read the book, but it has very good reviews - and most people stress the point that it is much better than the film.The story is relatively simple. A renowned fighter pilot, World War II ace and instructor (we know he spend years as member of US military mission to Greece, training local pilots), major Cleve Saville (Robert Mitchum), is affected to a squadron of F-86 Sabres in Korea. He is part of a wave of reinforcements destined to ""harden"" fighter units, after the Chinese send to the front improved versions of MiG-15, manned by pilots who recently underwent an intensive upgrading training in Soviet Union. Major Saville will command a flight of four F-86. His three subalterns are Lieutenant Corona (John Gabriel), an almost supernaturally calm young pilot; Lieutenant Abbott (Lee Philips), a courageous man but with quite serious issues; and finally Lieutenant Pell (Robert Wagner), an amazingly skilled and almost pathologically brave pilot, but also an absolute ""pain in the neck"" in every other aspect...The day of his arrival in Japan and just before being shipped to Korea, major Saville meets a somehow mysterious young Norvegian woman and becomes instantly fascinated by her - and the attraction is mutual, at least to some extent. And then, just before things go too far, he learns, that this young woman is actually the wife of his wingman, Lt. Abbott...All of that happens in the first minutes of the film - and from that moment on, the story progresses on two fronts (sorry, I couldn't resist). First, there is the war in the airs over the Yalu river, with the F-86 keeping watch over the bombing and close-support missions in support of United Nations troops in the peninsula. And then there is a much subtler (but almost as dangerous) game of attraction/rejection, suggestion/manipulation, seduction/transaction, ""catch me if you can"", etc., between major Saville and Kristina Abbott...The character of ""Kriss"" Abbott is a very, very interesting one. Swedish actress May Britt (she later married Sammy Davis Jr, after converting to Judaism) plays her with great skill - and she also gives her character a very special accent (supposedly Norvegian), which makes things even MORE interesting! It is a special charm of those older films, that women played extremely dangerous, mysterious, almost snakelike vixens, when in the same time maintaining on the surface the demeanor of perfect ladies... The tensions rising around the triangle ""Saville/Abbott/his wife"" are also a very interesting thing to watch.As you can see by simply looking at the cover of the DVD, things will finally have to land somewhere - and it will be a very harsh landing for some... I will not provide spoilers here, but the second part of the film is quite surprising - and no, it is not by mistake, that in a film about fighter pilots one of the characters is shown in dirty infantry winter clothing, holding a Soviet-made PPSh-41 sub-machine gun (weapon used in Korean war by many North Korean and Chinese soldiers...). The ending is not easy and not exactly as we could expect it - and I will say nothing more about it.The success of the film was probably helped by a good working relation between Mitchum and the director, Dick Powell. For most of his career an actor in musicals, he started directing only in the middle of the 50s and in 1957 he and Robert Mitchum made together ""The enemy below"", one of the best and most tense war films about submarines. This complicity certainly helped them to make ""The hunters"" into a fairly good film. Sadly, their cooperation ended soon after, as Powell felt grievously ill and finally after a courageous battle died from cancer in 1963.A special mention goes to the images of air combats - they are quite well done, for a film made in 1958. For lack of genuine MiG-15 fighters, the director used Republic F-84 Thunderstreaks, American fighters looking a little like those famous Soviet planes, which missed the Korean War by a couple of months. Multinational character of United Nations troops is underlined - and the images of Japan in the Year of Grace 1953 are also quite interesting.So all in all, although not really an immortal masterpiece, this is a very honest, quite interesting war film. I spend a nice evening watching it - and it is a MUST for all fans of Robert Mitchum! Enjoy!","Hunters, The '58"
147429,"""Foxy Brown"", written and directed by Jack Hill in 1974, was supposed to be a sequel to 1973's ""Coffy"", which had made Pam Grier a star. But American International Pictures felt that it should be a stand-alone film, as sequels were not doing good box office at that time. As a result, the name of the protagonist became ""Foxy Brown"", which proved to be an iconic choice, but there is also a vagueness about Foxy's situation, because Jack Hill couldn't use the character details from ""Coffy"". Despite these problems and a very limited budget for supporting cast, ""Foxy Brown"" is probably the best-remembered of the ""blaxploitation"" genre with a female lead, and the name follows Pam Grier around to this day. It helped make her one of the few true female action stars in film history.Foxy Brown (Pam Grier) has to rescue her brother Link (Antonio Fargas) when a couple of thugs come after him for money owed to a loan shark. Link has promised his sister that he quit dealing drugs, but now he's in deep with the same criminal syndicate over a gambling loan. Foxy's frustrated with Link but looking forward to her boyfriend being released from the hospital soon. He worked as an undercover federal agent trying to find evidence against a heroin wholesaler for two years. Now he has been given a new nose and a new name, Michael Anderson (Terry Carter). But when he is released into Foxy's waiting arms, Link recognizes him and thinks he can sell Michael out to the drug kingpin, Katherine Wall (Kathryn Loder), in exchange for a clean slate.There is over-the-top behavior, over-the-top wardrobe, and a lot of star power from Pam Grier, without which this might not keep the audience's attention. Grier is an imposing physical presence, and she can get people rooting for her even under the most preposterous circumstances. ""Vigilante justice? It's as American and apple pie,"" says Foxy. Then she tries to convince us. There is sex, unabashedly gratuitous nudity of the topless variety, torture, mutilation, and a lesbian bar fight, among other improbable scenarios. And, thankfully, humor. It's all about spectacle... with an anti-drug message, though the good guys are about as nutty as the villains. ""Foxy Brown"" was a funky vehicle for Black American subculture, and it seems to be an attempt at crossover, as well.The DVD (MGM 2001): There is an audio commentary by Jack Hill, which is fairly constant and informative. Some of it is scene-by-scene commentary, but Hill also talks a lot about the film's conception, changes and limitations that were imposed by the studio, his relationship with the talent in the film, themes, and his intentions. There is also a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles are available in French and Spanish.",Foxy Brown VHS
1500525,"Father and son, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez, have put together a nice little film about the pilgrimage, ""El Camino de Santiago"", in Spain. Sheen drove the route with his grandson and thought it would be an interesting idea to do a documentary about the pilgrimage, but Estevez thought it would work better as a feature film and ""The Way"" proves Estevez's instincts were right.""The Way"" is about father and son Daniel Avery (Emilio Estevez) and Thomas Avery (Martin Sheen) who don't have the best of relationships, but Daniel wants to see the world and embarks on the pilgrimage in Spain ,""El Camino de Santiago"", also known as ""The Way of Saint James"" and father and son go their separate ways. Thomas Avery is involved in his life, playing a round of golf when he learns of Daniel's death in the Pyrenees mountains during a rainstorm so Thomas goes to Spain to collect the body of his son. While he gets his son's affairs in order he learns of the pilgrimage his son had embarked upon and decides to honor the journey by completing it for him. As Thomas hikes the roads from town to town of the pilgrimage he meets fellow pilgrims who have taken up the quest for their own particular reasons. Borrowing a bit from the ""Canterbury Tales"", Estevez (who also wrote and directed) imbues the characters with the same archetypal qualities but gives them all one thing in common, they're all caught up in their own worlds and as they met and journey together on this road, the more they're able to reveal of themselves and come out of themselves.""The Way"" is a quiet movie, no big scenes, no big acting, Martin Sheen of course turns in a nicely nuanced portrait of a man at first caught in his world but slowly expands his horizons, there's not even a big moment of epiphany that explains it all for the characters or us, the characters find their own peace in their own time and their own way.",N/A

263508,"The Ladies Man (1961) was Jerry Lewis' tenth solo film, and his second as director.  Lewis, then age 35, plays recent college graduate Hebert H. Heebert, who after having his heart broken, has decided to remain a bachelor.  After leaving New Jersey, Heebert is hired by a cook named Katie (Kathleen Freeman) to be a houseboy for Miss Helen Welenmelon (Helen Traubel), who unknown to him, has converted her huge mansion into a boarding house for thirty young single women.  Surrounded by a sea of females, Herbert gets an overdose of what he was trying to avoid.While the movie features dozens of attractive women, perhaps the biggest ""star"" is the massive set for the interior of the mansion.  Featuring a cutaway view through several floors, stairs, and an elevator, the set represents an alternate to reality.Lewis' style of humor typically features him making others the victim of his incompetence.  Early on however, there are few targets available, so instead Herbert assumes the role of victim, falling prey to circumstances, and being abused by various ladies.  Later the tide turns, and Herbert begins to do damage to others.  Buddy Lester appears as a suitor, and becomes an early victim.  When a production crew from a television program called Up Your Street, comes to the mansion to shoot an interview with Miss Welenmelon, it provides ample opportunities for Herbert display some of his many ""talents"".While never known for being subtle, Lewis mostly keeps from going too far.  Smooth transitions between scenes, are generally not a trademark of Lewis' films, and there are many instances where various gags are just strung together, without a connecting thread.  When an awkward scene featuring Herbert and George Raft ballroom dancing abruptly fades out, it's not the least bit unusual.  Herbert also attempts to feed Miss Welenmelon's pet, perform a ballet, and engages in a wild dance number with Sylvia Lewis and Harry James and his orchestra.  Herbert doesn't have a main love interest, but Fay (Pat Stanley) is his closest friend.  The movie is a little uneven, but what makes The Ladies Man worth watching is the unique interior set, the thirty young women, and interesting scenes featuring large numbers of players.The image quality of the DVD is quite good, and this release has some impressive extras, including deleted scenes, outtakes, and rehearsal footage.  According to IMDB, many more scenes were deleted.  Typical for his Paramount films, Lewis and his friend Steve Lawrence provide a commentary track.  Jerry doesn't appear to have any animosity toward the process, but his commentaries are not the most fan friendly.  At times Lewis seems somewhat indifferent, or perhaps too engrossed in watching the film to say much.  Occasionally, something onscreen will act as a trigger, and Jerry will come up with some marvelous gem from his vast treasure trove of memories.  Unfortunately, these occasions are rare.  While Steve Lawrence also gets lost in watching Jerry's films, but he does act as a facilitator, asking questions and trying to engage Jerry in discussion.  It's a pity, that he's not more successful.",Ladies Man VHS

114881,"A rousing John Wayne war movie that mixes some fact with a great deal of fiction.  PT Squadron #3 was stationed in the Phillipines at the time of the Japanese invasion.  Four of the boats were involved in 'rescuing' MacArthur and other officers from Corregidor and all of the PT boat men involved in the rescue received the silver star for heroism.  Yes, the mission entailed a great deal of danger but the PT boat crewmen were operating under orders so 'all round' silver stars would seem to be unwarranted.  That the crews may have felt this way as well is depicted in this film.  The crewmen, on hearing of their awards, regard the occasion with complete indifference.  A parallel to this 'silver star' situation is the attempt to kill Sadam Hussein by means of a B2 bomber that flew non-stop from the U.S.  There was no aerial opposition and the assassination attempt failed.  Nevertheless, all the members of the air crew were awarded the silver star.  Generally speaking, the army and air force have been liberal about the awarding of medals.  The Marine Corps, on the other hand, has been far more conservative.The combat scenes in 'Expendable' are unrealistic and Hollywood-Jazzed up.  At the time--early 1942--U.S. propagandists claimed that the 6 boats of PT Squadron #3 had destroyed several Japanese ships.  I am unable to find any mention of confirmed 'kills' on Google.  It is, of course, possible that some small Japanese boats were destroyed and that these successes were conflated into large warships.  To be certain no Japanese 'flat top' [as claimed in the film] or Japanese cruisers [as shown in the film] were destroyed.  The PT boats did hit one Japanese light cruiser--The Kuma--in the bow but the torpedo was a dud.  Torpedo failure was a common U.S. naval problem at this time of the war and wasn't corrected [I think] until 1943 when an undetonated German torpedo was found on a U.S. beach.  The torpedo was carefully examined.  U.S. torpedo warheads were modified and U.S. torpedoes--mostly fired by submarines--started to have real success.In any event, Torpedo Boat Squadron #3 didn't sink the Kuma nor did it sink any other significant Japanese warship.  The Kuma was actually sunk in January 1944 by a British submarine.  Apparently all the of torpedo boats of Squadron #3 were sunk by enemy fire or scuttled to prevent capture by the enemy.  These facts in no way impugns the courage of the PT boat crewmen.  It takes a lot of guts to attack a large ship in a plywood motorboat.",They Were Expendable VHS

Directed by Juilan Grant he mostly has done TV work & straight to DVD movies. He didn't have much credibility so maybe that means  Jose Padila will surprise me with The Robocop remake. Then again maybe not. It stars Page Fletcher as Robocop-Alex Murphy, Maurice Dean Wint as John Cable, Anthony Lemke as James Murphy, Maria Del Maras Sara Cable, Kevin Jubinville as Damien Lowe Leslie Hope as Ann R Key, Geriant Wyn Davies as David Kaydick & Rebeka Coles Budrys as Jordan. Story is it's 10 years after the 1st film OCP is still around there's no explanation of how there still in business cause The OCP building blew up in Robocop 3. But it's up to the discrection of the viewer at least they didn't erase all continuity like John Hyams did with Universal Soldier Regeneration. I think it takes place in the same continuity as 1, 2&3. Delta City has became a reality Detroit is now just a city of outcasts. OCP has put in a Zero Fatality policy cops can't use guns on criminals they feel criminals only use guns when they feel threatened. So 1 night you have some radicals holding people hostage at The Chelsea Clinton Saving & Loan building. You have 1 guy go out & blow himself up. Commander  John Cable shows up & takes control of the situation when 1 of the radicals runs out to blow himself up John Cable pulls out 2 handguns & shoots him dead. Robocop shows up to put an end the situation. This negotiator ladty tells Robocop not to use force. He does anyway & shoots this firing an assault rifle dead. He goes in tells the hostages to get out. Then you have Bonemachine bust in he kills the radicals with ease & owns Robocop. OCP is near financial collapse again they need new ideas an executive named Damien Lowe has SAINT a computer that can control everything in a officer building or your house. You have another executive Sara Cable who is the ex Wife of John Cable. As well as Alex Murphy's Don James who has recently joined OCP. Ssra Cable starts working with James Murphy. Robocop tries to figure out how Bonemachine has all that weaponary. He starts using image enhancements & sees OCP markings on it. He shows it to Commander Cable he confronts Sara over it. She has James Murphy take care of it. A guy hacks into Robocop & puts a 4th Directive in him kill John Cable. So Cable is meeting Robo at The Security Concepts building. Robo starts trying to arrest Cable Robocop shoots him in the leg. Then you have some flashbacks when Murphy & Cable were partners in Metro South & when Cable killed this serial killer The Motor City Mangler. Cable was held at gun point by The Mangler he tells Murphy to take the shot & Murphy puts his gun down The Mangler is distracted by him Cable puts him on the ground before Murphy can handcuff him Cable shoots that huy dead. OCP was taking over The Police Department & Murphy was transferred to Metro West at this time. John Cable has been framed as Bonemachine. Robo goes to Metro South in Old Detroit. He knows that Cable will be there. He tries to fight off the command to kill John Cable Cable tells him ""We used to the best now were just dinosaurs a joke."" Bonemachine busts in this was a pretty good action scene. They damage Bonemachine a little bit. Cable is behind a wall firing shot after shot from the 2 handguns. He's grabbed by Bonemachine held at gun point Cable tells Murphy to take the shot. Robo says ""I'm sorry John."" He kills Cable then he goes after Bonemachine starts firing his gun at him. Bonemachine takes his mask off Robo sees that this guy was a Cop who was The Captain at Metro South Robo takes his data spike & repeatedly stabs him as he just lets out all that hate & anger.

I vaguely remembered seeing some scenes from this Zorro back in the 90's, but I had never watched it.  After the Telemundo Zorro, I wanted to try it out and the reviews here on Amazon were so good, I was very excited to get it (plus Amazon had it on a good sale for a weekend).To be honest, so far I have only made it through the first DVD of the first season, but it has been quite painful.  This is SOOO bad.  It's almost on the level of the original Batman (except Batman knew it was silly).  There is no real drama, but to be fair it's hard to get real deep in a half hour show, especially when you have to have at least one sword fight plus a feel good ending where they all sit around laughing at the goofy sergeant.  Not only is it family friendly, it seems written for, if not by, 12 year olds.  The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters are one dimensional, the plots are silly and predictable, and the theme song is terrible (To compare, listen to/watch the theme song from the Telemundo version, Amor Gitano by Beyonce and Alejandro Fernandez).  (By the way, I just watched the episode where a fake Zorro burns down a Native American village.  I'm certainly not sure, but did the Native Americans in California use tipis?)Is this going to get better?  I'm doubting it, but I'll keep going through another disc before I try one of the other seasons.  (I'll update if at some point it starts to become good.)",N/A

Jane is not glamorous. However, the girl's widower, father notices Jane's goodness.The film holds your attention. Filmed on location. Nice sets and costumes. The relationships are believable. This version moves at a better pace than other versions.The 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson is a good version too. Its slow pace is redeemed by some excellent scenes. In the 2007 version; Jane has some charm and personality. Both Jane and Rochester are likeable. Women viewers will love the romance of the Masterpiece Theatre version.The 1944 black & white version begins promising during Jane's childhood, because the headmaster is a true villain and Jane wins our sympathy. However, Jane's childhood is a brief part of the film. The main story of Jane's adult life centers on her relationship with Rochester. Orson Welles' Rochester is so harsh and unlikeable without any redeeming qualities that it is not believable Jane would like him. Rochester's house may be historically accurate, but it is so dark and dreary, with no daytime scenes of light to give any hope, that viewers are overwhelmed with depression.The 1-star reviews of this 1996 version are all by people who have read the book. If you have not read the book; you will like this. Two people can read the same book and imagine very different characters. A reader with a vivid imagination will always imagine something better than any movie can reproduce. What this movie does; it does well. There is more of the story to be told in future versions. The 1996 version is a heartwarming film. It is a story about a plain girl who develops qualities a man can love.",Jane Eyre VHS

1508010,"Professional sports in America (and more recently elsewhere as well) has always been about making money, making money for the owners, making money for the players, and making money for the inevitable ten-percenters that come around whenever the smell of money  is in the air. Professional big time sports, moreover is about big money, real big money as this slice of sports management film, Moneyball, amply demonstrates. But it is also, at some level, depending on the sport, the team, and the guys who put together such teams about winning, winning the brass ring. And that is what makes this film that I would probably pass over on other grounds so intriguingFrankly it has been a while since I have even summoned the courage to watch sports on television much less attend some event in person. And that takes some doing in a city like Boston which over the past decade or so has won championships in all of the four major sports in America (baseball, football, basketball, hockey for the very clueless). And the main reason for that stance is the point I made above about the money pit. But it also about the obscene price of the winning that has distorted the legitimate role of sports in society way out of kilter. Winning and winning merely by overwhelming out-spending the other guys seems to have diminished my capacity to watch  guys who are mostly going through the motions.But Moneyball, and the story behind it presents another story, a story that I could actually relate to. What if you just, strapped for cash and in a minor franchise market, used every available method, including technology to build a team not of hot shots (although they are nice to see) but of guys who could stand to be together in the same room for more than fifteen minutes. That seemed like a premise worth trying.And that premise gets a tryout here as Billy Beane (played by Robert Redford, oops, Brad Pitts), as the general manager of the Oakland As (a team that back in the glory days, back in the Reggie, Catfish, Sal, Blue Moon, et. al days,  back in the early 1970s when I lived there, I followed like crazy), a wonk from Yale and a recalcitrant manger (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) work their magic, and work it almost to that final game of the year. The one that in the end is the only one that counts. But, except maybe in horseshoes, almost doesn't count doesn't mean a thing so it in the end is back to the drawing board to work out the missing links. Nice try though, nice premise, and nice sports film even for non-sports nuts.",N/A
1549305,"""Unicorn City"" is what happens when tabletop role-players throw off the shackles of the gaming table and take it to the outside world.  Gamers can commiserate, be it tiring of a tyrannical game master (Jon Gries), annoyed by the rowdy public spaces of game stores, or just wanting more excitement in props -- ""Unicorn City"" fulfills the fantasy that every gamer probably had at some point: What if I could make it all real?  Or at least, as close to real as possible without making it hurt?The answer is Live Action Role-Playing, but like so many nascent game designers, it doesn't occur to Voss (Devin McGinn) that such a thing might already exist.  Nowadays we have True Dungeon: It's Dungeons & Dragons for gamers that want the feel of a true dungeon environment without having to immerse themselves in a role.  In ""Unicorn City,"" Voss finally realizes that even his extensive gaming experience is not sufficient to net him the ultimate gaming job in Washington State: Working for Wizards of the Coast -- excuse me, ""Warlocks of the Beach"" in this film.  How will he prove that he can be a leader when all his leadership has only taken place in a fantasy world?By making the fantasy world real of course! Does it bear mentioning that Voss plays a bard?  Are you surprised?And so Voss conducts a secret power struggle for the soul of his group: his live-in roommate, the gamer guy with the clingy girlfriend who tags along, the tough dude who'll play anything if he can kick butt, and the foreign guy who doesn't always understand what's going on.  These are stereotypes, but they are nuanced stereotypes that go beyond the dork who knows everything about geekdom (I'm looking at you, Big Bang Theory). It's a welcome change that's only possible because the writers are gamers.There's also a delightfully nerdy gamer chick who makes her own dresses.  Marsha (Jaclyn Hales) is adorable in a pretty-ugly girl sort of way, but Voss can't see it.  The writers gave her another quirk too -- under stress, she has to take her medication -- that makes her vulnerable and believable.  She may be cute, but she belongs in this geeky world of outsiders.And so our fearless heroes decide to embark on a fantasy world of their own creation titled ""Unicorn City,"" in which people dress up like monsters and attack each other in a field.  ""Unicorn City"" takes particular glee in scrubbing the shine off LARPing by demonstrating that it's essentially camping with swords. Eventually, the aforementioned tyrannical GM (Shadowhawk) discovers what the group is up to and returns to reclaim the soul, if not the heart, of the group.""Unicorn City's"" climax reaches cult-like proportions that eventually involves the police, but somehow manages to sweetly and hilariously tie everything up in a way that's satisfying.  This is a love note to any tabletop gamer who has had the urge to run away screaming from the table, holy avenger in hand.",N/A

1414393,"First, this is a fine movie.  I liked Robin Wright's restrained acting in the difficult part of Mary Seuratt.  The movie leaves us in doubt about her guilt in the conspiracy to kill Lincoln as it must.I watched this movie just a few days after seeing Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln.""  During that film Lincoln gives an extended explanation that he freed the slaves during the Civil War as a matter of military necessity even though he was unsure whether the action was constitutional.  He had also suspended the right of habeas corpus during that war.  In The Conspirator Mary Seuratt is denied a civil trial and is tried by the military at the behest of Sec. of War Stanton who states he wants to preserve the newly won peace.  (The Supreme Court later upholds a citizen's right to a civilian trial according to a note at the end of the film). Stanton also works with Pres. Andrew Johnson to deny a writ of habeas corpus submitted by Seuratt's attorney in a last ditch effort to save her from being hanged.Part of the message from the film is to remind us, particularly after 9/11, that we have this recurring theme in our history of ""bending"" the Constitution when events cause our emotions to run high.  We are reminded that the rights of all citizens are protected in that Constitution.  It is a message that will always bear repeating and that was well done in this film.",N/A

The movies ""Thor"" and ""Iron Man"" are pretty much pre-requisites to seeing this movie, but you can get away without having seen ""The Incredible Hulk"" or ""Captain America"".  If you haven't seen ""Thor"", you won't really understand who Loki is or what his motivation is.  Hmm, on second thought, even having seen ""Thor,"" I'm not quite clear on that.  Nit-picks: the alien invaders are too easy to kill (Black Widow and Hawkeye can dispatch them easily with guns and arrows.)  During the final battle, surely some humans must be killed, but do you see any?  So, that's not very realistic.  The 3D isn't quite realistic: there appear to be three different and distinct layers of objects.  Inside his Iron Man suit, Tony Stark's face appears flat while the 3D computer graphics are floating in space.  Plot hole: at one point, Loki could have easily escaped, although this is somewhat ""explained"" later.If DC ever gets around to making a Justice League movie, they'll have their hands full trying to top, or even match, this one.

method of regenerating brain tissue using donors which will not be rejected.Ted Raimi is the professors funny sidekick.The professor sends Raimi off with a note to present to Bruce in order to get funding for the project.Bruce outright rejects it.Bruce discovers the gypsy has absconded with a ring meant for his wife.He runs after her but in the confrontation gets whacked over the head with a pipe and is later put on life support.The cabbie sees this and he too is fatally stabbed.The professor hears about Bruce's dilemma and puts his theories to practical work on his brain.Unbeknownst to Bruce,he uses part of the cabbies brain to inject into his to regenerate the tissue.This causes Bruce to not only see things he couldn't have(the cabbies memories)but it has the effect of the cabbie's brain parts controlling Bruce's left arm,while Bruce controls the other.This amounts to an ongoing battle for domination of Bruce's brain,thoughts and actions.Meanwhile,Bruce's wife confronts the gypsy who also offs HER.She ends up in the professors lab and her brain is transplanted into a robot Raimi has been playing with for sometime.Bruce/the cabbie and his wife/robot end up hunting the gypsy down.The wife gets tossed over a bridge before Bruce can finally dispatch the gypsy.There is a tearful goodbye as Bruce's robotic wife dies in his arms.The film ends back in the States as Bruce is back home and reunited with his wife...in the gypsy's body!This film is just chock full of gags of all sorts and at no point does the film take itself seriously.Somehow,the sequence with a tearful Bruce holding his robotic wife DOES work.It gets you right where Bruce wanted you to get it.It's a bit of a windy plot,but it is just so quirky that it works beautifully all the way.I didn't find a dull spot in it.It is something like,oh,I'd say Bubba Ho-Tep,something so odd and off beat,that it's good.Ted Raimi of course is always a delight and never fails to please.Stacey Keach also gets honourable mention.Four solid stars.Alien Apocalypse finds Bruce and Renee as two of three astronauts in the future.They were sent into space and eventually went into hibernation for 40 years before coming back to Earth.However they come back to a world that has been taken over by large mites,looking for all the world like giant green ants.The aliens are in need of wood,which is their first delicacy.Their second is human heads.Renee and Bruce are captured and brought into a camp to work as slaves to harvest wood.The two become very close and later attempt an escape.Bruce makes it while Renee is recaptured.Bruce goes on to look for the president,who it is believed is hiding in that neck of the woods and planning an uprising.He finds him but he is more interested in painting than fighting.Bruce realizes he has to take on the burden himself and works his way back to the encampment to free Renee(his girl)and the rest of the humans there.He picks up about 25-30 people on his way and they attack with bows and arrows.They do indeed kill the resident aliens and claim the camp for their own.However more aliens arrive to retake the camp.A pitched battle takes place and just as it looks bad for the group,the president arrives with many more people to finally kill all of the aliens left.The film ends as Bruce has become legendary,as he goes from one camp to the next,killing aliens and taking back the Earth.This film has little or no drive at all except for Campbell's bravado and forceful style.It is obvious it is low budget and that Bruce is working,for the most part,with alot of inexperienced actors.That aside though,the plot is just nothing to get excited about and poor Renee O'Connor really doesn't have a decent line in the whole film.It's up to Bruce to carry it all,and one man can only do so much.2 1/2-3 stars.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in their w/s a/r's of 1:77:1.Extras on both include commentary,trailers,bios and featurettes.All in all we have one good and one poor entry here.""The Man..."" is the best of the bunch,being inventive,oddball but totally enjoyable.""Alien...""is the bad apple.With a totally lame plot,old CGI and Bruce carrying everyone in the film.",Man with the Screaming Brain/Alien Apocalypse Bruce Campbell Two-Pack
1553430,"""Bel Canto"" is a fair descriptor of the predominant vocal technique of opera and oratorio from the late 17th C to the early 19th. It's used more commonly, however, to classify the works of Rossini (1792-1868), Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835), and others less well-known. ""Beautiful Singing"" was the sine qua non of Baroque opera, and it's at least arguable that Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini can be best heard as ""late baroque"" in important ways. The retrospective hallmarks of Bel Canto include: smooth legato, wide seamless range, light and lovely timbres, impeccable breath control, NO dependency on vibrato for projection or to mask tuning and no excessive/constant use thereof, precise diction, and above all extreme agility in executing ornaments and divisions. It's a vocal technique best suited to small and acoustically supportive theaters; it's impossible to sing real Bel Canto in a gargantuan hall, and that's probably the chief reason that Bel Canto was superceded by Can Bellow in the operas of the later 19th C.""Zelmira"" is a ""late Rossini"" opera -- premiered in 1822, and followed by only three completely new operas (Semiramide, Le Comte Ory, and Guillaume Tell -- but it bears no sign of surrender to post-BelCanto aesthetics. In fact, it's utterly Baroque and unrelenting in its demands for vocal technique. It has a libretto as silly as any by Handel and it poses vocal challenges that renowned singers of Verdi and Wagner, of the last generation, could not meet. Fortunately, this production was staged in the small Teatro Comunale di Bologna, with a proportionately small orchestra and with a cast of disproportionately brilliant singers. Yes, the staging is as dopey as the libretto, dopier if that's possible, with irrelevant flying symbols and headache-provoking camera work. The dramaturgy is ditzy. The costumes thrift-shoppy. But none of that matters! It's ""beautiful singing"" above all!Zelmira turns out to be the perfect vehicle for the Bel Canto talents of Juan Diego Florez, talents he's never been allowed to display in any other production I've heard, either live or on DVD. His character, Ilo, makes his first entrance a good way into the opera, but when Florez sings his first aria, the audience shakes the theater with applause. The villain of the piece, Antenor, is sung by Gregory Kunde with such serene beauty that one can almost excuse his sins and blame his nastiness on his scheming underling Leucippo. But then Leucippo -- Mirco Palazzi -- also sings bello bello bel canto. Kate Aldrich sings gorgeously in the dramatically awkward role of Zelmira, but she's upstaged vocally by Marianna Pizzolato in the secondary role of her friend Emma. It seems that Rossini had an extraordinary singer available for that role in his reworking of the opera for the Paris stage, and so he inserted a scene for Emma all by herself and gave her the most dazzling aria of the show. Polidoro, the deposed king and father of Zelmira, emerges from secrecy in a temple crypt, a ghastly shadow of a man, yet he also gets his Bel Canto moments, sung with grave resplendence by Alex Esposito. I've named all the principals of this cast because they all equally deserve resounding applause for beautiful singing.Okay, the DVD is a visual calamity, but DON'T be satisfied with a CD in its place. The drama is hard enough to follow even with stage business and subtitles. Put up with the crummy staging and relish the singing. It's perhaps the best and most authentic Bel Canto we'll hear in our lifetimes.",N/A

1251220,"This is one of those sleeper high quality films except it probably won't get noticed terribly in DVD sales simply because it doesn't have explosions, isn't a rom-com and wasn't recommended by the Academy Awards. It's too bad because there's a lot of high quality acting and wonderful tone setting in this family drama.Tale focuses upon a romance novelist reflecting on his abusive time as a child in which his father verbally and physically abused him and put him through ""torture"" when he was displeased with the boy. Now, after the death of his mother, he has to face his father's anger as well as all of the other dysfunctional family members. He's got a novel written that is about his life growing up and basically lays out all the family dirt and he's trying to decide whether to get it published or not.There's a bittersweet taste to this film. At times you laugh, at times you feel like you just got hit in the gut and other times you feel people are going to work out their differences. It's one of those films that tries to reflect real life so sometimes there are no happy and complete resolutions but for myself I left the picture feeling satisfied with the delivery. It's nice to see a film every now and then that admits things aren't always resolved like a fairy tale. That's called fantasy, people. That said, I felt the main character worked things out just not in a Pollyanna manner.There's an all star cast here, including several who took supporting roles: Willem Dafoe, Julia Roberts, Carrie-Ann Moss, Emily Watson, Ryan Reynolds, Hayden Panettiere and Ioan Gruffud.The budget for this picture was $8M (which tells me a lot of big names took pay cuts to work on a project they believe in) but it only made a bit over $3M at the Box Office. We'll see if it does better in DVDs and residuals.Written and directed by Dennis Lee. Some say his tale is autobiographical. Note that the movie was edited and seems to be missing over 20 minutes so their may be a director's cut at a later point.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; THEMES/FAMILY FOCUSES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.",Fireflies in the Garden [Reg.2]

That said, it is a hoot and a half even if you don't understand the intricacies of the plot (not that the plot's genius...just somehwhat convoluted/involved).The Frighteners is dark comedy or humorous horror movie, depending on your take.Michael J Fox is a paranormal investigator who is legitimate, but he scams people by having ghosts he works with haunt houses so he can get a paycheck for ""cleansing"" them.His wife was killed in a car accident under suspicious circumstances and he has never forgiven himself and the police still suspect he was somehow involved.Events soon start happening that lead him to believe that his wife was murdered and the murderer was a ghost.The film is essentially about him trying to solve the mystery of her murder and stop additional murders along the way.There are plot elements that involve Charlie Starkweather and his rampage and an extension of similar in the plot.The film is raucous fun, but you do need to pay attention to what's going on, because several different sub-plot lines are running tangent to the main one.I don't want to give too much away as this is a fun film to watch on a stormy night to give you just a bit of the creeps and quite a few laughs.Oh, yeah, and if that isn't enough this was one of Peter Jackson's (Lord of the Rings trilogy, King Kong, The Hobbit) first films.",N/A

1399468,"J.J. Abrams, as a creator, has been something of an amalgam. He more or less started out making a splash with the TV show FELICITY which was, to me, a rather antiseptic drama. Then came his next big show ALIAS, which was his first foray into genre-bending TV; a high-octane spy thriller mixed with enough drama to make the characters interesting and enough twists to make the more jaded fans tune in weekly. However, he hit his stride with LOST, a show that was universally beloved as it was confusing, but the plot became somewhat secondary to the characters. That show was populated by so many unforgettable characters that, despite fans' misguided anger over the series finale, the show will be forever ingrained in the viewer's brain. And it was during LOST that Abrams started making his foray into feature films; his first being MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3. M:I-3 is a better film than I remember it being, while at the same time, fusing perhaps a little too much reality into a rather absurd concept which I think ultimately hurt the film but I certainly can't fault Abrams for trying a different approach to a somewhat stale concept. The next film he did was one of the best pure ""Summer"" films I've seen in recent years, and that was his reboot of the STAR TREK franchise. It created a genuine love and a strong sense of nostalgia of the original series with a lot of winks and nods, but helped to fashion an entirely new direction for such well-known characters with its one major LOST-like plot twist. It was evident that with series like LOST and FRINGE and films he helped make like the nod-to-Godzilla CLOVERFIELD and then STAR TREK that Abrams, while confident he could create new worlds, he grew up in the era of the Summer Blockbuster, and most of the major filmmakers who grew up during that era usually end up making a film that pays homage to that era. SUPER 8 is Abrams love-letter not only to the era, but also to the master of the Summer Blockbuster (and also my personal favorite filmmaker), Steven Spielberg.Abrams crafts a wondrous, heart-felt, and very well-made tale about a group of youngsters who have banded together in a small Ohio suburb in the late 70's to make a zombie film to submit to a festival, and wind up smack in the middle of a government conspiracy surrounding the escape of an imprisoned alien life-form that puts their entire town at risk. At the center of this tale is the young VFX makeup artist, Joe (a very talented Joel Courtney), a pre-teen who lost his mother recently in an industrial accident. His town-sheriff father, played by the terrific Kyle Chandler, has withdrawn into himself and there is an almost complete disconnect with his son. The other kids making the film are similar to the group of kids we've seen in E.T. or THE GOONIES or any number of Spielberg-ian kid groups, but the young actors and the characters themselves are fleshed out enough to be more than just stock characters. Once the slightly-older Alice (wonderfully played by Elle Fanning) becomes involved in the project, it goes beyond just being a boy's club and the elements of romance and betrayal introduce themselves, particularly from Joe's father since Alice's father (the wonderfully wounded Ron Eldard) may have drunkenly caused the accident that killed Joe's mother. While just the drama of the group and the characters would be enough for one film, that's when Abrams gives us the train crash the kids catch on their Super 8 camera that is the key to the danger and mystery that enshrouds the whole town, and naturally, the danger comes not only from the alien creature, but also from the government, which is embodied by a terrific and menacing performance from Noah Emmerich.As I stated earlier, the film has enough drama and momentum to make an entire film out or either subject (family drama or alien danger), but Abrams, like Spielberg before him, entices us, delights us and ultimately astonishes us with combining these elements into one big smile of a film. I use the phrase 'smile of a film' not because the film is a hilarious blast to watch, because there are a few moments of heart-wrenching emotion and seat-gluing terror. I use it because when we look back on some of the great Summer Films we've seen in our lives, such as STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, BACK TO THE FUTURE and JAWS, inevitably we smile because these films represent the very best of this kind of filmmaking and something that has been very noticably absent from many films post-1985 (since the biggest film of 1986 was TOP GUN), and suddenly the Big Summer Blockbuster became a monster. The likes of Spielberg and Lucas and Zemeckis and Donner changed the rules of the game for better or worse, and all of them started with the best of intent, but along the way, character and story took a massive back seat to spectacle and effects and action and money. This is not to necessarily criticize all of the Summer Blockbusters we have gotten since, but on most of them, the luster is lost after the season is done. Whether that's due to the quality of the film or the over-saturation of the Summer Blockbusters (It's all about Opening Weekend grosses now, and it's becoming increasingly rare that a film is #1 for more than one weekend), that subject is up for debate. But there was a time when we could easily look back at the films of a particular summer and say, ""That was a great film and it will always be a great film"". SUPER 8 is a very passionate love-letter to those times, but it also finds itself with the distinction of being one of those films that wasn't just a great Summer film for 2011, but will be a great Summer film for all time.",N/A

109472,"Altered States literally got me INTO floatation tanks, and what is known now as R.E.S.T. (reduced environment stimulation therapy), not the old foreboding sounding term, sensory deprivation. i was so enthralled w/ the film, i found a tank back in 1980 in San Antonio, and discovered what floating was REALLY like, and i loved it. it is completely quiet, absolutely dark, and the filtered water, which is saturated w/ Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) to practically 50% (they got it wrong in the film when Arthur says 10%.), and makes you float like a cork. plus the water temperature is 93.5 degrees (maintained by solid state waterbed heaters, in the ones i built), which is skin temperature, so once you steady yourself in the tank, after a short while the feeling that you are in water, virtually disappears. after 20 minutes or so you fall into a deep trance automatically, similar to meditation, but you don't have to do anything; the environment, and lack of stimuli does it FOR you. in the absence of stimulation, the brain begins to create its own, so sometimes you have pleasant hallucinations, and studies have shown your natural, brain ""feel good,"" opioid like, endorphins increase. (subjects given naloxone, an opiate antagonist, often given to heroin overdose patients to block the effects, say they do not experience the euphoria associated w/ floating while on it.) after falling into that trance, the usual cycle is to remain there, in sort of a timeless state, for about and hour, to an hour and a half, and you come out of it feeling extremely relaxed, w/ your perceptions very sharp. (you also shower off the Epsom salt.) the effect lasts several days. and you do not turn into primal man, or a quasi-simian creature! the horizontal tank w/ the beveled end, including the door, that appears in the movie, was based on one designed by R.E.S.T. pioneer, and dolphin expert, the late Dr. John C. Lilly, who the character of Eddie Jessup is loosely based on in Paddy Chayefsky's novel, which the movie was derived from, and a screenplay by Chayefsky, which he switched his name on to Sidney Aaron, because of differences w/ the production. frankly, i love the production & kno every line of dialog... Lilly authored many books on states of consciousness, and one in particular on tanks, called - The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique, 1977, Simon & Schuster. Lilly did do some floating on psychedelics, and reported his findings in his books. in fact, he actually did it on Ketamine, (which further blocks your sensory input), i remember reading in a Penthouse interview. just to say i had tried it once, i did do it on a psychedelic, and found the experience somewhat overwhelming. i did not freak out, but i concluded that the tank experience, in and of itself, is more than enough for self-exploration WITHOUT the use of any kind of drugs. after all, the whole point of it is to change your state of mind, by changing your environment. drugs become superfluous, so i really disagree w/ Lilly on this.i became so enamored w/ floating in 1987 i built a floatation tank of my own, and have been floating off and on, as i have moved around and assembled new tanks, for the past 25 years. i usually do it about 3 times a week. it is great for your blood pressure, arthritis, depression & anxiety, drug abuse, and many other conditions. i did an independent study on it in college for the head of the psychology dept., and got full credit and an A. i am considered one of the authorities on the subject in N. America.Altered States has become my all time favorite film (tying w/ 2nd & 3rd Clockwork Orange, & 2001 a Space Odyssey). it is not a Dr. Jeckel & Mr. Hyde story; it is one of love and redemption. in the end it is the love of Eddie Jessup's wife, Emily that brings him back from oblivion. there are many great reviews here; i do not have to reiterate them. what i want to say is that as a BluRay edition/release THIS IS A COMPLETE FAILURE. one would think that after 32 years, they could have been a little creative w/ this. there are no extras at all, except for the trailer. not a damn thing that wasn't on the DVD, (which had an option on it that said, ""Float Naked"" that went nowhere!) they could have done a retrospective on Ken Russell who was born to direct this film. they could have done something on the work of Dr. John Lilly and the science of R.E.S.T. they could have done something on the beautiful score, by Pulitzer Prize winning composer, John Corigliano (which was released in the late '80s Dolby ProLogic surround sound). they could have done something on Bran Ferren's amazing, award winning special effects. they could have done something on make-up pioneer, Dick Smith. need i go on? there isn't even BluRay Live feature to connect w/ other fans. this film has a huge cult following! as a BluRay release, it looks and sounds great (on my 46"" Sony LCD HDTV & 7.1 channel Home Theater, in DTS-HD Master Audio), but that is all that can be said about it. if you are a fan GET IT for that reason alone. (i pre-ordered it as soon as i found out is was being released, for $13.96, and Amazon refunded me $3.97, because the price had come down, which is a great reflection on its worth as a BluRay edition!)  Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a piece of disappointing crap. i was really looking forward to some intriguing extras. (if you can find them somewhere, i did, the defunct SciFi/Fantasy movie magazine, Cinefantastique did two editions on Altered States around the time the movie came out, that were superb. one was on the making of the movie, and the other was on Dick Smith's incredible make-up effects. i cherish them dearly.) some of the best stuff in A.S. is Arthur & Mason (Bob Balaban & Charles Haid) getting into verbal cat fights, when they are loudly talking over each other. one time i watch it i try just to listen to one of them, the next i listen to the other. William Hurt (Jessup) & Blair Brown (his wife Emily, most recently in Fringe) have been favorite actors of mine for decades. i have followed all of the primary's careers over the years.m.k. smith",N/A

This one had the low-budget cheesy stuff that I was looking for, but it felt like they tried to compensate by making the rest of it as serious as they could. The acting was so bad though that it didn't come off like they wanted. It became a movie that thought it was more serious then it was. Still fun to watch, but not one of the better of this genre.

Lazy-ass Hollywood film makers can't come up with something original have to STEAL from the classics! Well, after watching this version I have to say they have done a fine job. Well written, well acted. In the end much more of the story shines through then the orginal movie which was over-shadowed by the Duke. This time around the story and the how the characters respond to each other (the word play is awesome) is the shining star. Where the Duke could say a million possitive things with a short statement (burning daylight) Jeff does by doing rather then by saying. Yes this is a story, but it reflects the real world. Stopping at nothing to get the girl medical attention after being bitten by a snake (because that is what is really important) rather then giving a horse a ""break"" shows us what we have lost in the modern world. We cry when watching a video of a limping dog being mis-treated yet turn a blind eye to a man or woman who has found themselves on the street. Rooster shows us what is truely important.

321531,"The early 1970s contained some of the greatest examples of the disaster-movie genre - ""Airport"" (1970), ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972), ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974), and ""Earthquake"" (1974).  These movies are the Cadillacs of the business.And then you've got ""The Swarm"" (1978), which along with ""Meteor"" (1979) and ""When Time Ran Out"" (1980) closed the door on the disaster craze for a while, and with good reason.  ""The Swarm"", though quite earnest in its theme, is probably about as bad as it gets for a movie regardless of genre.  That's what makes it so fun to watch.  Ostensibly, the stars of this movie are Africanized killer bees - millions of them that invade a US Air Force missile complex, terrorize a small town in the middle of its annual flower festival, then set their sights on the metropolis of Houston.It's up to Michael Caine, who plays a bee expert, to try to figure out how to lure these bees away so that people can live in peace again.  But if left up to a hard-nosed air force general played by Richard Widmark, and his right-hand man (Bradford Dillman), half the United States might get wiped out getting rid of the bees.  Katharine Ross is on hand as an air force doctor who ends up getting stung by bees, and Henry Fonda does his best as an aging bee expert to try to find an antidote to their stings.Of all the scenes in the movie, perhaps the funniest occurs when Richard Chamberlain, as one of Caine's peers, and Jose Ferrer, as the manager of a nuclear power plant not too far from Houston, die when bees overrun the plant and cause it to explode.  It marked the second time that the late great Irwin Allen killed off a Chamberlain character - he did it to Chamberlain in ""The Towering Inferno"" - but this time, he took over 36,000 other people with him!Also cranking up the cheese-meter is the ending, after which the producers thank the industrious and docile American honeybee for its contributions to our society.  I won't spoil what happens before the honeybee gets its props, but suffice it to say, you'll shake your head and go ""are you kidding me?""  But that's what ""The Swarm"" is all about.

1544794,"Author Jodi Picoult has penned some surprisingly ambitious and thought-provoking page turners.  Adapting them, though, is a sometimes tricky proposition.  Here are three Lifetime TV movie attempts that met with varying degrees of success.  Not a bad collection for the price if this is your type of entertainment.  I'll comment more extensively on ""Salem Falls"" as the other two movie have been around for a while and/or released on DVD previously.Salem Falls (2 1/2 Stars):  From 2011, this adaptation probably veers the furthest from Picoult's original vision of small town scandal.  When a mischievous trio of high school girls employ the dark arts, one wishes to find a mysterious new love interest. Enter drifter James Van Der Beek, a man who seems to be on the run from a troubled past. The loner meets up with a local diner owner when he almost kills her father!  How's that for a meet-cute? As he takes a temporary job in her establishment, romance blossoms between the two even as the high school vixen makes her play for the irresistible stranger that was conjured specifically for her (she's a bit of a nutcase). Of course, the present day circumstances start to feel uncomfortably familiar to Van Der Beek and the secrets he wants to stay buried surface in the most unpleasant ways. After the fairly successful set-up, however, gets Van Der Beek in hot water with the town (it's a literal witchhunt), the movie turns into a pat and convenient mystery.While Van Der Beek seems a bit too stoic to inspire such instant adulation, the beginning of ""Salem Falls"" is a decent enough entertainment. But things start to go awry when it strays away from soapy melodrama into supposedly more serious territory. The complicated issues presented aren't explored with any depth and the past mystery is solved with ease (too bad the cops are always inept in these movies). It doesn't help that the movie ventures into very familiar territory and its resolutions are trite and cliched at best. Seriously, when this movie tries for weepy movie of the week hysterics, I lost any good will that I might have had.Plain Truth (4 stars):  From 2004, this endeavor benefits greatly from a no-nonsense approach to its horrific central crime.  A baby's mysterious death is the catalyst for most (if not all) of the movie's action that brings a high powered attorney to a small Amish community to defend the young mother against murder charges.  Expecting huge amounts of melodrama with such a sensational subject matter, I appreciated that the plot remained focused on the investigation, the facts of the case, and the impact on and responsibility of the Amish community.  Of course, any TV production would be lucky to have the presence of Mariska Hargitay.  I could have lived without the simpler lessons doled out to this professional woman (city life and success is always looked on with such disdain in these types of stories), but Hargitay is such a terrific actress that she grounds every role.  Alison Pill does a good job as the teenaged mother as well.  They play off each other well and the movie has a few noteworthy surprises on the journey to the inevitable conclusion.  A solid entry for Lifetime and a solid interpretation of Picoult's work.The Pact (4 Stars):  From 2002, this movie gives comedic actress Megan Mullally a chance to stretch in a challenging role.  If you love Picoult's source novel, ""The Pact"" probably suffers by comparison as it doesn't have the opportunity to really dig as deep into the underlying truths of the story.  But it is such an intriguing and emotional tale, I still think that it is a worthy TV movie effort.  When a young couple engage in what appears to be a suicide pact (only the boy, Eric Lively, survives), the families involved are plunged into a waking nightmare.  The families are so close, the movie underscores how this traumatic event forever alters their comfortable existence.  Mullally plays off great character actress Juliet Stevenson for the movie's most dramatic sequences (they are the two mothers).  As their friendship deteriorates, the film really resonates.  Not as preachy as you might expect, the movie does try to examine the realistic emotional consequences without resorting to tear-jerking manipulation.  I give it much credit for that.  Not perfect, but worth it for the performances.  KGHarris, 7/12.",N/A

1526441,"""Death and Creamation"" is elevated by a wonderfully textured and low-key performance from Brad Dourif, an underrated character actor who probably should be allowed to lead more often.  He brings a nice understated sophistication to his role as a killer and humanizes a character that in a lesser genre film would have been filled by a cartoon monster.This is not brilliant film-making by any stretch, and some of the smaller roles (especially those of the police detective and the bullies) were hammy and unprofessional.  But I was struck by the interestingHarold and MaudemeetsApt Pupilvibe, and the way that the story was propelled by relationships and personalties rather than--as happens too often in horror--mere events.I will even give ""Creamation"" credit for setting up a memorable final ""line,"" the answer to a crossword puzzle clue that fits beautifully.

454309,"The first three ""Subspecies"" movies had their good points and bad points, but overall they were entertaining little vampire movies.Not so with ""Subspecies IV: Bloodstorm.""This is one of those movie sequels that does absolutely EVERYTHING wrong. Nothing about this story actually goes right, from Radu's makeup to continuity to the inclusion of new characters who are ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS. And what character development the main characters have experienced is literally tossed out the window within the first few minutes.Having been burned alive and impaled on a tree, Radu (Anders Hove) falls into a convenient pond, which extinguishes him enough that he can creep back into a crypt. Meanwhile, Becky and her compatriots get into a fatal car accident mere seconds into the film, and everyone dies except Michelle (Denise Duff). Yay. At least Michelle survived. Because I like her character so much.Michelle is rescued by a passing doctor, who takes her to the clinic of the crazy-eyed Dr. Nicolescu (Mihai Dinvale) WHO IS SO OBVIOUSLY A VAMPIRE. He recognizes Michelle's condition, and promises to cure her -- but he's especially interested in getting the Bloodstone. And Radu returns to Bucharest, taking over the holdings of his other fledgling, the refined and elegant Ash (Jonathon Morris) -- who also has plans to get rid of Radu.""Bloodstorm"" does everything wrong -- continuity, makeup (Radu now looks like a paper-mache witch),  pseudoscience, characterization, vampire lore, and the fact that all the established characters EXCEPT the ever-useless Michelle die ignominious, worthless deaths less than a minute into the story. There is nothing RIGHT about this movie.Instead, most of the movie consists of Michelle lying around whining, Dr. Nicolescu making crazy eyes, and Ash making vague ""we should totally kill Radu, but for some reason we're not allowed to"" speeches. Occasionally something happens that seems like it should be significant (such as Dr. Nicolescu's trap for Radu), but it usually ends up being pointless. There's even a subplot about Inspector Marin becoming a comedy-relief vampire... and dying without having made any real impact on the plot.And remember all that character development that Radu had in the previous movie, when he was starting to show regret and love? Well, forget about that, because he's now a 2-D baddie who now wants to live the high life in the big city. And Michelle is worse than useless -- when she isn't just lying around crying and whining, she's ACTIVELY saving Radu's life... because she wants to be free of him. STUPID.The new characters have some potential, even if Dr. Nicolescu's buggy eyes will haunt my nightmares. Ash is the refined, gentlemanly vampire that Radu is not, and Dr. Nicolescu has found a substance that allows him to walk in the daylight. But neither of these characters really get fleshed out adequately -- Ash in particular contributes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the story.""Subspecies IV: Bloodstorm"" is one of the worst sequels I have ever subjected myself to -- this is the vampire version of ""Troll 2.""",N/A

It deserved them! The story involves four business men from Atlanta who take a canoe trip down an obscure river running out of the Appalachian Mountains of Georgia. It's a weekend adventure hosted by Burt Reynolds. The adventure starts as four guys having a grand time and then turns evermore grim. Two of the troupe (one canoe) get stopped and captured by a really creepy duo of ""mountain men"" and one of the boaters is sexually assaulted under gunpoint in a grim scene. A second attack is about to take place when Reynolds (of the other canoe) comes onto the scene and puts an arrow through the perpetrator, killing him. The other mountain man escapes. The canoeing group then is in a debate as to what to do and how to do it, and they also have to escape the revenge of the other mountain man and his friends. It's a harrowing and grim trip back to civilization and one of the original group doesn't make it.It's just a well done movie. Exceptional! The acting is excellent, as is the direction.

1533101,"I've been keeping my eye out for more films with Elizabeth Olsen, who absolutely captivated with her fantastic performance in MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE, and when I heard about her role in Chris Kentis and Laura Lau's intense thriller SILENT HOUSE, I felt it was a must-see, and when I finally did, I didn't read too many of the reviews here so that I could keep an open mind going in and not to have anything spoiled for me (which, frankly, Amazon reviewers are wont to do). When I came out of it, I was surprised at how tense my muscles had become while watching, because this is a film that once started doesn't let go.Working with a ""one take"" narrative device, the film focuses on Olsen, her father and her uncle as they are cleaning out their huge old summer home to sell. The house is without power and runs on generators, portable lanterns and good old-fashioned candlepower. There seems to be a good family vibe as they explore the areas of the vast house, until a noise is heard upstairs, when there shouldn't be one. Logical explanations are posited, but suddenly the terror begins as it appears intruders have entered the house intent on nothing other than doing harm and psychologically torturing the poor young woman. The film becomes less about story and more about the ultimate voyeuristic exercise, since the camera forces us to follow around Olsen as her terror becomes more and more amplified and we truly get to experience all of the various emotions of her performance since Kentis and Lau employed this unusual narrative device. When the truth of the situation begins to reveal itself, it may seem like some to be a twist that is reminiscent of Alexandre Aja's HIGH TENSION, but in truth, this is much better because you feel that this destination was something the film was heading towards as opposed to a ""shocking twist"" designed because the filmmakers couldn't figure out how to end this.It's hard to point out any particularly effective sequences because the film is all one sequence really, although it does have a three-act-structure. Kentis and Lau obviously employ some very smart technical wizardry to this film because you really can't tell (or at least it's not obvious) where the film does have cuts. There are moments, such as the darkening of the room and in REAR WINDOW-esque fashion, Olsen uses an older-fashioned Polariod Instant Camera to illuminate her surroundings. The final act transition is something that is totally fluid and pretty breathtaking to behold, not only on a technical but on a performance level as well. The film does feel like several different films are being paid homage to, particularly Hitchcock's ROPE with the unbroken narrative, as well as any number of spooky old house films and home invasion fright-fests like THE STRANGERS and HAPPY GAMES and even PSYCHO, which again speaks to the very Hitchcockian element to this film and the understanding of Hitchcock's understanding of making audiences feel terror by making them something of active participants in the terror, which is no small feat.Olsen, who's absolutely the centerpiece of the film, creates an incredible anchor in her performance in this film. There's never a moment that seems inauthentic to her character, and there's never a moment where I felt that she was doing the absolutely wrong thing, even though logic might suggest otherwise. Logic very rarely presents itself in a situation like this. The vastness of the house becomes a character as well as new nooks are discovered through her hiding and running. Also the camera becomes its own character as it shifts points-of-view from first to third and back again. It invites us in to a place that we don't necessarily want to go because of the terror that this young girl is feeling and the lack of reason behind it initially. Who here is suspect?The disconnect, I believe, for the audience at large is they went into this film expecting Horror Story A and then got Psychological Thriller Story B. This is a film that gives a very pervasive feel of dread all throughout, and frankly that's part of where the film had me AND lost me at the same time. It's impossible to please everyone all of the time, and this film, while mostly very impressive, didn't give enough chances for the audience to breathe. I absolutely understand why they chose to do it that way, but if you give the audience a chance to catch their breath from the constant nerve-jagnling tone, the more terrifying the film ultimately becomes when you allow for even just a brief moment of levity.Aside from that complaint, I have to highly recommend SILENT HOUSE for people who are more fans of cinema and less fans of scary films, much like another recent release THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, which is very much not for the casual horror fan. If you allow yourself into SILENT HOUSE, you'll find you have much more reason to leave than to stay, but you also won't be able to help yourself.",Silent House

Well, it finally happened, and I'm pleased to say it followed the book very closely without getting preachy. I was never captured by Rand's mantra to begin with; it was the story that grabbed me from page one. Who is John Galt? Why are all these entrepreneurs disappearing? I could care less about Dagney and Hank's romance. It is their role as heroes that interested me. This movie did not disappoint. That's why I bought it.

1521356,"This 1973 film was an excellent candidate for remastering and Blu-ray enhancement, having a freedom of movement and spaciousness that astounds in this newest version; I believe it was originally filmed in an enormous aircraft hangar. Many agree that Nureyev was at his peak during this time, and his charismatic brilliance is most apparent here, backed by a superb cast. Nureyev closely oversaw all aspects of the filming; it bears his stamp. Not many films merit the trouble and expense of conversion to blu-ray; this performance however is one for the ages. Excellent bonus features as well.",Don Quixote: Nureyev
1469783,"I watched this film with a fair amount of expectation after hearing about it from a few people who went on and on telling me about how it was a glorious throwback to all those great action movies of the '80s and '90s. Unlike The Expendables, this film was supposed to devoid of meta-humor or irony, which was a refreshing idea, frankly. After all, the best B-movies in history were not made by people *trying* to make B-movies. So I rented it, settled in and rooted for Guy Pearce and co. to transport me back to the good old days...Let me start off by pointing out what the film does (mostly) right:1) It gives us the prerequisite badass antihero complete with mysterious past and snappy one-liners.Aaaand that's about it. Seriously, Guy Pearce's character is the only reason to think about seeing this movie. He's tough, cynical, sarcastic, professional. Too bad he's all there is to it. And to top it off, the one thing he's supposed to excel at in the movie--the action--is an incoherent mess. Within the first five minutes, there's a terrible CGI sequence that moves so fast, you don't even get the sense that anything's at stake. One thing that many so-called B-movies had (and I'm thinking of the good older ones directed by guys like John Carpenter, George Cosmatos and Joseph Zito, to name a few) was spatial coherence: you knew where everything was in a scene, where every explosion was coming from, what was at stake. Lockout, unfortunately, goes for the modern action movie method where everything moves way too fast and there's no sense of spatial logic. There is some decent gunplay in the space prison, but nothing spectacular, and not much in the way of hand-to-hand combat. What the movie's really missing is one terrific, memorable action setpiece, something that most of the films Lockout is borrowing from managed to have.People have described this as a blend of Escape From New York and Blade Runner. Well, the prison setting here isn't as interesting as in Escape (and really, how could it be), and whatever dystopian future exists in Lockout is too limited by the film's low budget to compare with Blade Runner's far-reaching exploration of 2019 L.A.  The main villains are interesting, but for all their antics, they never seem to rise above the level of minor inconvenience, and they're not all that memorable. Nobody here is going to make people forget Isaac Hayes as the Duke.I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But at the end of the day, all we've got is one sharp lead performance surrounded by a bunch of mediocre action and CGI junk. Lockout is a B-movie among B-movies, and no, that's not a compliment.",N/A

508613,"&lt;strong>The Sentinel&lt;/strong> (Michael Winner, 1977)I have, on occasion, gone back and watched beloved films from my childhood and youth to see if they have stood the test of time. It's been a sporadic thing to date, but I decided that this year I want to make a regular thing of it, and browsed Netflix until I found one I hadn't seen in at least twenty years: Michael Winner's &lt;em>The Sentinel&lt;/em>. I still have Jeffrey Konvitz' novel on the bookshelf, and I haven't read &lt;em>that&lt;/em> in easily thirty years, so some of what I have to say about the comparisons will be... hazy at best. (I will try and make sure the language reflects such when necessary.) But the bottom line is that when I first saw the movie, I had read the book &lt;em>very&lt;/em> recently, and I think that may have affected my judgment. Because &lt;em>The Sentinel&lt;/em> is a shallow, gratuitous film that is best remembered these days for having such a high-powered cast that Jeff Goldblum, Ron McLarty (in his first screen appearance), Tom Berenger (in his first feature appearance), and Nana Visitor (in HER first feature appearance) didn't manage to rate in either the main titles' A list OR B list, both of which contained over a dozen names. And let's not forget that both Richard Dreyfuss and Vicki Michelle make uncredited cameos. Is there ANYONE in this movie who wasn't on the A list at some point?Plot: Alison Parker (&lt;em>Nashville&lt;/em>'s Cristina Raines) wants some time away from her long-term boyfriend, high-powered attorney Michael Lerman (&lt;em>Fright Night&lt;/em>'s Chris Sarandon), so she gets a place on her own. In a Brooklyn Heights brownstone. Fully furnished. For four hundred dollars a month. That was wacko even in the seventies. Still, the estate agent, Miss Logan (the great Ava Gardner in one of her final big-screen appearances), is just as enthusiastic about the place as Alison is, it's got an amazing view, and what more could you possibly want? She takes it, and soon meets most of her crazy neighbors. There's Charles Chazen, who looks and sounds an awful lot like Burgess Meredith. As much as I love Burgess Meredith, he never could play anyone but Burgess Meredith. Then there's the creepy couple downstairs, Gerde (&lt;em>Midnight Cowboy&lt;/em>'s Sylvia Miles) and her paramour Sandra (Beverly D'Angelo, best-known these days for the National Lampoon's Vacation franchise). In fact, the only one she hasn't met is the blind priest in 5A, Father Halliran (John Carradine), but then, he's a recluse. Not long after moving in, Alison begins to have fainting spells, problems with her concentration (you wouldn't think that would be a problem for a model, but as one memorable scene with Goldblum and Jerry Orbach points out, it can be absolutely horrifying!), that sort of thing. Michael is understandably concerned, and he enlists Alison's best friend, Jennifer (&lt;em>God Told Me To&lt;/em>'s Deborah Raffin), a local expert in dead languages (&lt;em>Psycho&lt;/em>'s Martin Balsam), and even the Diocese of New York (represented here by Arthur Kennedy and Jose Ferrer). But that's not all... a couple of cops, Gatz and Rizzo (Eli Wallach and Christopher Walken), are convinced that Michael has something to do with Alison's problems, and that it all ties into Michael's previous wife's suicide, which may not have been a suicide at all...Phew. Plot synopsis? It's hard to cram all the A-listers in and get the relationships set up in less than five hundred words. And to be fair, there &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a plot to this mess, though I can't really tell you what it is since very little of it is revealed until the climax, and every major revelation leading up to it would also be a spoiler. But it all does have a point. Well, most of it has a point. The movie's major problem is that Winner jettisons most of what ties the more prurient scenes (including one featuring Ms. D'Angelo that her fans will want to watch the movie for, and a dream/hallucination sequence that may feature the most explicit gore scenes shown in a theatrically-released American feature film up to that time) to the plot, but leaves them in as shock set-pieces. They're memorable, but since they're not tied to anything, they feel somewhat anemic.As I said, I haven't read the book (or its sequel, &lt;em>The Guardian&lt;/em>, which was even more ludicrous) in dog's years, so maybe I'm misremembering it completely, but if I'm right about my initial reaction to the film all those years ago, my having read the book not long before seeing it allowed me to fit some pieces in place that would have otherwise made little sense had I come into the film cold. You might want to give the book a shot before watching this. ** ",N/A

476565,"This BBC presentation from 2000 netted its star Frances O'Connor a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a miniseries or movie, and that certainly shouldn't come as a major surprise.  The character of Emma Bovary is easily one of literature's most fascinating and frustrating heroines.  Although largely unsympathetic (I suppose you might conveniently call her an antihero), it is an epic character arc ripe for dramatic interpretation.  With this literary pedigree, however, it probably isn't a simple task to encompass and channel the intricacies of Gustave Flaubert's classic novel.  And indeed, that is the case here.  Although this two-part adaptation is solidly constructed, well acted and handsomely produced, it still lacks some of the finer nuances of Flaubert's prose.  Again, though, I think that is to be expected.  So instead of comparing the two mediums, I'll just say that BBC's ""Madame Bovary"" certainly stands on its own as a worthy version of the story.As I mentioned, O'Connor does portray the titular Miss Bovary.  The story begins as a youthful Emma finds perceived love in the arms of a country doctor (Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey).  Coming from meager circumstances, Bonneville symbolizes success and possible escape from her provincial upbringing.  But as Emma grows weary of being a doctor's wife, she is constantly on the prowl for the next bit of excitement.  Self-obsessed, utterly selfish, and oftentimes cruel, Emma wants what is always just out of reach.  Over the course of her marriage, she finds solace in the arms of an innocent student (Hugh Dancy) and a rakish aristocrat (Greg Wise).  Although these relationships display ample heat and passion, Emma's attachments always feel opportunistic as opposed to completely heartfelt.  What seems like a perfect marriage will possibly be the undoing of the central characters as neither seems capable of making the other happy.  If you're not familiar with the story, it's not hard to see that we're on a road to tragedy throughout.Much of the success of this incarnation of ""Madame Bovary"" rests on the shoulders of its appealing cast.  I must admit that O'Connor isn't particularly the Emma of my imaginings, but I rather liked her play between softness and aggression.  Bonneville doesn't have a great deal to do as the put-upon husband, but when he breaks from his mild mannered nature--you will take notice.  Dancy and Wise are terrific, and very different, foils for our Emma.  In particular, I thought the relationship with Wise (one of the few times she isn't in total control) was dynamic and memorable.  Lastly, great character actress Eileen Atkins steals every scene she's in as Bonneville's disapproving mother.  Whether you love the book or have never read it, this is a worthy and entertaining adaptation.  The two parts are presented together on one DVD (With an interesting Bonus Feature of Flaubert).

779598,"If you were to go through my reviews I've written here on Amazon, you'll find I have not said kind words about other works from Mr. Bay. Mainly, the Transformers sequels are among the most pain I've been in watching any movie ever. I also think PEARL HARBOR is one of the most misguided movies ever made. At least part of my disdain is because of BAD BOYS 2. This is the kind of movie Michael Bay should be making and I view those other movies as a waste of his time and his talents.All of Bay's indulgent and excessive behavior are on full display here, which is normally a bad thing for his films, but I love it here. There's a couple reasons for this. One, this is a hard R-rated movie. Tons of vulgarity, fantastic violence, scantily clad women filmed a very gratuitous manner, and a weird, shocking disregard for human corpses runs throughout the film. Some would describe this movie as ""ugly"" and ""mean spirited"" and, sure, even ""misogynistic"" and while I wouldn't argue that, the whole thing is so over the top that I found it all very amusing. So much better than the juvenile, obvious humor found in the Transformers movies. Two, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are two terribly charismatic actors and they have such wonderful chemistry in this movie. They're having a blast making this movie and it is a blast to watch them doing it. There is a scene in this movie that has absolutely nothing to do with anything where the two of them interrogate a boy who is there to take Martin Lawrence's daughter on a date. It is so far beyond ridiculous and every boy's worst nightmare taking someone's daughter on a date and hilarious. Compare this to Optimus Prime stepping on Shia's Mom's flower bed in TRANSFORMERS which I find to be completely grating and awful. So the lesson is, if you're going to be indulgent, do it with charismatic actors, not lame-o cgi robots.Also impressive is that this movie is kind of coherent. It has a story that it mostly sticks to. Make no mistake, the story is not good nor is it important, but it provides a solid frame work for everything that happens. You know why scenes are taking place, why they're driving cars through buildings, why they're shooting up everyone. It seems obvious, but Bay seems to have forgotten this lesson with his last two films.I can talk all the trash I want about any of Bay's films, but one thing the guy is always good at is framing very nice, expensive looking shots and editing them together in the most entertaining, thrilling way possible. His movies feel like they cost more money than ever other movie, which is admirable. Nowhere else is this talent of Bay's better served than it is here. Every car chase and action scene are loads of fun and exciting, and there are quite a few of them. Bay seems to have an unlimited amount of visual ideas and he's putting a good chunk of them on display here. Also, there's a good amount of practical effects, or at least it's CGI that looks like it's practical. This movie has aged incredibly well.So yeah. I kind of love this movie.

Actor, martial artist and stunt man, Tak Sakaguchi made his name not just in Japanese cinema but action and obscure film as a whole with roles in such films as the cult favorite Versus, Death Trance, Battlefield Baseball, Azumi 2, etc. Now in Yakuza Weapon, a release by Sushi Typhoon, Nikkatsu and Well Go USA, Tak Sakaguchi plays Shozo Iwaki, a tough-as-nails Yakuza with a mad dog approach to battling his enemies. He is actually son to boss of the Iwaki family - one of the most powerful crime families in Japan - and as such, he is out to make a name for himself and usher the family into the new age of Yakuza business. But before that, he goes overseas to fight in a militarized zone, though the exact location and reason are absent from the film so far as I can tell.When he returns to his beloved Japan four years later, much has changed. His father has been assassinated by Yakuza underboss Kurawaki, who has the ambitious plans of taking over not just the Iwaki crime business but that of all the Yakuza families in Japan. When Shozo learns of Kurawaki's treachery, he seeks him out. Full of vengeance, Shozo wreaks havoc on Japan, blasting, blowing up, puching, kicking and insulting his way to his target. All the while, he is pursued by the beautiful, overly smitten Nayoko, the daughter of a Yakuza boss and new head of that family, whom Shozo promised to marry upon his return to Japan.What follows is an orgy of violence, mechanic body alterations, unhealthy sexual obsessions, dildos, irreverent humor, more violence, betrayal, a battalion of drug-addled zombies, genital rocket launchers and nipple machine guns, and when all is said and done love and revenge.Also, Yoshihiro Nishimura was involved in the prosthetics and other effects, and one can always be sure his involvement in any film will make it that much better.Like so many other Japanese films of its kind - Machine Girl, RoboGeisha, Helldriver, Battlefield Baseball, Death Trance, Versus, Samurai Princess, Meatball Machine, Ichi the Killer, Hard Revenge Milly, etc. - I absolutely recommend this one.",N/A

406071,"What shame. One of the finest musical films ever produced makes its (triumphant?) blu-ray debut boasting the same old transfer that was used for the DVD release a decade ago. First of all, let me say that if Warner Bros had been handling this release the film would have looked breathtaking. This not being the case, fans who have already purchased this release are left with egg on their face.The transfer used on this disc was fairly impressive for its time and looked rather brilliant on a standard definition TV. Why, even up-scaled and from a fair distance I have still been consistently impressed with the restoration work done in 1994 which was indeed substantial. But times have changed and standards have been raised with the advent of blu-ray. The only real difference here from the standard DVD would be that this ""new"" transfer has been ever-so-slightly up-scaled from what was either a standard definition source or an extremely lackluster HD source. Technically this disc is listed as having 1080p resolution, but to say that it even resembles 720p would be somewhat of a stretch. I would probably give this transfer the green-light for an HDTV airing, but not a high definition home video release by any means. If you have the 2-disc DVD edition, stick with that. The resolution appears exactly the same on an HDTV when up-scaled with a competent blu-ray player and all special features are present.To be fair to the people at Paramount, the original film elements that would form the foundation of any new film restoration may indeed still be in the hands of Warner Bros Studio. I am not entirely clear as to why the home video rights have shifted from the original studio which produced and released this picture, but it is very likely that Paramount was given a digital master to work with and nothing else. This is all speculation mind you, but you can rest assured that Warner would not likely hand the original elements over to Paramount/CBS nor are they legally obligated to do such a thing. I digress.The only (and I mean only) way I can recommend this disc is if either A) You don't own the movie at all and want the best transfer currently available WITH all of the current bonus features or B)You own the one-disc edition and feel like you're missing out on the special features from the 2004 special edition.The movie itself is a real gem.

876819,"Mr. Jonathan runs a hair salon, but it comes across more like a brothel considering the women lining up for Jonathan's...ahem...services.  Jonathan seems to jump in the sack with just about any woman that steps through the door, yet he comes across as rather bored with ""servicing"" these women.  This changes though when he develops feelings for his new receptionist, Brenda.  Ya see, Brenda's on the run from Mr. Wilson(no, not the guy from Dennis The Menace), who's obsessed with her and wants to keep her for his own.Mr. Wilson tracks her to the salon and tries to strongarm her back, but now he's got Mr. Jonathan to deal with.This is Black Shampoo!!  It's a fun blaxploitation romp from Greydon Clark, who as you all remember, brought us such fun flicks as Satan's Cheerleaders and Joysticks.  The first third or so of the film is dedicated to Jonathan's sexploits, then it's kind of a love story, then Jonathan gets to put the hurt on the mobster goons(and they really are goons here!).Since we don't deal with any real violence or action til the final act, some may find this a tad boring.  The beginning is kind of like a softcore Skinemax flick.  One disturbing scene has Jonathan accosted and nearly raped poolside by two girls who don't look a day over fifteen!  And to make a disturbing scene even more disturbing, Jonathan ends up having sex with the mother of the girls at the poolside with the girls watching from the pool!The final act is a hoot as we're treated to chainsaw carnage, vehicular manslaughter and curling iron sodomy.  Who can resist watching it now after knowing that?John Daniels is a memorable leading man, but the character seems like he's swallowed a handful of downers, even during the fight scenes.  Is that one cool cat or what?The tone is a bit tongue in cheek, but it's not really as funny as it tries to be, especially in a scene where the goons trash the salon.  It's obviously done in a way that's supposed to be comical, but it plays out kinda long winded and just kinda....odd.  There's another odd scene where Jonathan and Brenda are running through the woods trying to escape Mr. Wilson and his goons.  Brenda(I'm assuming)is tired and out of breath, but is making sounds like she's having sex.  It's strange.In the end, this is a fun piece of 70s blaxploitation, maybe a tad slow at times, but fans of the genre will know what they're getting into.",N/A

I've heard of the ideas of connectivity and the science backing it up so this film was rather dull.  The film talks little about whats wrong with the world and how to change it and instead talks a lot about life's purpose or the way we should be living life.  There were also very few scientific examples and its mostly just what a few famous people said and that must be the correct way of thinking or behaving.  And thats what really ruined it for me.  The only parts I liked was when the film maker was talking about his life experiences, what he went through and why he changed.

1536009,"When you first lay your eyes upon ""Adventure Time"" and allow your ears to hear such ridiculousness, your adult brain may be a little befuddled. ""This seems like somebody just threw a bunch of random things together and tried to make a cartoon,"" the intellectual side of your brain may be telling you as it adjusts its fictitious pair of reading glasses and adds a bit more fake tobacco to that pipe that not only doesn't exist but wouldn't be able to use even if it was somehow based in reality. But give it a few episodes and let its genius sink in. Your brain and sense of humor will eventually be showering you with thankful gifts.""Adventure Time"" is extremely random and that's its charm. It basically comes down to a boy named Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and his magic dog best friend Jake (voiced by John Di Maggio from ""Futurama"") as they travel the land of Ooo looking for adventure. It doesn't sound like much, but its brilliance is in the little songs that Finn and Jake come up with, their amazing made up phrases, and the eccentric characters they encounter along the way. Season one introduces series' regulars Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), Ice King (Tom Kenny from ""Spongebob Squarepants""), Lumpy Space Princess (""Adventure Time"" creator Pendleton Ward), and Tree Trunks (Polly Lou Livingston) and fan favorites Ricardio (George Takei from ""Star Trek""), Donny the obnoxious grass ogre, and Magic Man.On the surface, ""Adventure Time"" is this appealing cartoon for children featuring characters with silly voices, bright colors, and songs, but it's a lot more adult than it lets on; like Jake's reference to having a foot fetish in ""Freak City, Finn telling Tree Trunks to get her hot buns inside in ""Slumber Party Panic,"" and Finn having to clarify that he didn't mean ""sexy hot"" in ""Prisoners of Love."" There's enough crammed into every episode for everyone of all ages to enjoy.While the animation may not be up to the standards of ""Teen Titans"" or ""Spongebob Squarepants,"" it's still extremely fluid and fun to watch. There's something about the characters waving wiggly arms, legs, or other body parts around that never gets old and is always hilarious. The facial expressions are the tip of the iceberg as far as animation goes though. Not only do they reference internet troll faces from time to time, but their facial expression along with a simple, ""Hm!"" say more than any line of dialogue ever could. Plus seeing them talk and seeing that many memorable expressions back to back in one or two minutes of animation is just kind of mindboggling.Everyone is going to have their favorite episodes, but personal favorites include, ""The Jiggler,"" ""Ricardio The Heart Guy,"" ""Memories of Boom Boom Mountain,"" ""The Witch's Garden,"" ""Ocean of Fear"" (written and storyboarded by J.G. Quintel, the creator of ""Regular Show""), ""Freak City,"" ""Donny,"" ""Rainy Day Daydream,"" and ""His Hero."" The show features a wide variety of respected talent to guest star on the show. Season one includes Mark Hamill, Lou Ferrigno, George Takei, Kevin Michael Richardson, Clancy Brown, and Andy Milonakis.One of the issues from the ""Regular Show: The Slack Pack"" and the ""My Two Favorite People"" and ""It Came From the Nightosphere"" ""Adventure Time"" DVDs is that they were so glitchy. The bottom of the previous scene would stick around for the following one and look all glitchy like when your old NES used to freeze up and you'd have to reset, blow in the cartridge, and start again. It made each single DVD release feel really shoddy and quickly thrown together. ""Adventure Time: The Complete First Season"" is glitch free. Every episode is crisp and clear. The only disappointing thing is that it isn't available with an HD transfer for a Blu-ray set. Well that and you'll wish you had season two to keep your season one set company.Extras and bonus features include commentary tracks on ""Trouble in Lumpy Space,"" ""Prisoners of Love,"" ""Tree Trunks,"" and ""Ricardio The Heart Guy,"" a nine-and-a-half minute Behind the Scenes featurette where Pendleton Ward wanders around the ""Adventure Time"" studio with a steadicam as weird things happen in the office and a two-and-a-half minute Behind the Scenes of the Behind the Scenes Feature, Animatics with commentary for episodes ""The Enchiridion!"" ""Rainy Day Daydream,"" ""Slumber Party Panic,"" and ""Dungeon,"" a music video, Finndemonium which features music from the show, fan art, and people in costumes at conventions, and the two-minute animated short ""The Wand"" where Finn and Jake team up with The Ice King to stop a haywire magic wand.""Adventure Time: The Complete First Season"" is now available in most retail stores and online outlets.

1485496,"Ever since ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" comic (not the movie), I've been intrigued by the basic premise: legendary characters from other genres are given the superhero treatment and then brought together under unlikely circumstances to face a global threat.  This structure is the standard plot of just about every Avengers and Justice League comic, but only recently -- perhaps a sign of the times -- has cobbling together a diverse cast of characters become movie entertainment.""Rise of the Guardians"" continues the trend by turning the dial on iconic characters like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman up to 11. Each of these characters gives a gift to children, which in turn causes the children to believe in them and bestows a form of immortality. It's an oddly parasitic relationship that was prominent in Wizard of the Coast's ""The Primal Order"" supplement, in which deities need worshippers to gain power. Our heroes may not be all that powerful, but they are certainly popular.  At least some of them are.One of the questions weighing on my mind in bringing my five-year-old to this film was how ""Rise"" would deal with Santa Claus. It's one thing to question the existence of the Tooth Fairy (I never liked her anyway), the Easter Bunny (does anyone believe he exists?), and the Sandman (pretty sure NOBODY believes he exists)...but Santa Claus?  That's some tricky turf right there.Parents needn't worry.  Santa is a jovial, dual saber-wielding slavic warrior full of wisdom, jolly humor, and generosity.  As voiced by Alec Baldwin, this is a Santa I can get on board with!The Sandman doesn't speak, but he pantomimes through thought-forms that lend themselves well to 3-D viewing.The Easter Bunny is voiced by Hugh Jackman, which seems oddly natural.  He's a combative, boomerang-wielding humanoid rabbit that can throw egg-smoke bombs like a ninja.  He's also pretty adorable.Isla Fisher (yes, the nymphomaniac from ""Wedding Crashers"") plays the Tooth Fairy as a neurotic workaholic who has been ""out of the field"" for so long that she no longer knows how to relate to kids. She also moons over Jack Frost (Chris Pine, AKA Captain Kirk).Frost is the teenager of the bunch, frustrated by his lack of fame which makes him literally invisible to children.  Frost is on a personal journey to discover how he became who he is and in doing so, accepting his role as a new Guardian of children.And that's what ""Guardians"" is secretly all about: aging gracefully into parenthood.  The older adults (the existing Guardians) worry about being forgotten, uninvolved in their children's lives.  Pitch the Boogeyman (voiced by an unctuous Jude Law) craves attention so much that he would be happy to just be feared because it means he will be remembered.  And Frost has to deal with his own childhood before he can become a parent.There are some amazing set pieces, plenty of clever quips, and enough magical battles to keep the movie clicking along.  But Frost is something of a bland catch-all for every rebellious ""cool kid"" in the history of movies (he wears a hoodie, he MUST be cool!) and his big revelation about his past isn't much of a revelation at all. ""Rise of the Guardians"" is clearly just getting beginning to launch a franchise, and this is a good start. But I'll take a movie about just good ole sword-swinging Claus any day.",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set
561101,"This version of the silent ""Last Days. . ."" is NOT the same one on the Steve Reeves double DVD. Although they were both released in 1913. And have the same director: this Caserini. After viewing three versions of ""last days.."" I would like to do some comparison. Remember 1913 silent version packaged with Steve Reeves 1959 version is not same as 1913 Kino version. So I will refer to it as ""non-Kino 1913 version"". I will do it by topic - for example:Christianity: I have been anxious to share my observation that the Christian element was played down in the 1913 Kino version. In fact, I do not believe there are any Christian characters. Of course, in the Reeves version the Christian element is very prevalent. Coming in 1959, after all the Hollywood Biblical epics, the film itself could be placed along side them. And there is a strong Christian element in the non-KIno 1913 version.Egypt: It is curious how they make the Egyptians the ""bad guys"". Remember, ancient Rome was a pagan society as well. Note: In the Reeves version, it is interesting how the concept of Roman Imperialism is brought up. The Egyptians, especially the scheming female character, are seeking revenge for having there homeland plundered, and being carried off by the Romans.Nidia: It is interesting how her part is played down in the Reeves version. She becomes the love interest of Glaukos' thieving little side kick. And does not kill herself, but is killed during the earthquake. Moreover, in the non-Kino 1913 version, this is the least ""politically correct"" of the films. Because after Glaukos buys Nidia - it is curious how he has love interest and a female slave at his feet.This is just a sampling of how this could be done. And I may add more later.",N/A
117027,"An Empire Ruled By A Madman. Hope Is Lost. Faith Is Broken. A Fire Will Rise.QUO VADIS is an excellent film depicting the rise of Christianity amidst the tyranny of Rome in 64 A.D. Starring Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Leo Genn and Peter Ustinov, the movie is mostly accurate in recreating what happened in Rome during this tumultuous period in history, which is more than can be said for almost any movie made these days about a historical event (300, anyone? that piece of wasted celluloid is sooooo inaccurate, just by looking at a trailer or a TV spot, it's not worth wasting your time on. And don't even get me going on Gladiator, Titanic or even Braveheart). Ben-Hur is another excellent Biblical epic, shot ON LOCATION AND WITH REAL EXTRAS...and there were thousands of them, same thing with The Ten Commandments (and I mean the silent AND sound versions of these epic films, made in 1923, 1925, 1956 and 1959). Of course, there is a fictional story at the center of the historical events; however, this only adds more weight to the already human drama playing out on screen. And this is also the way movies were made back then: with reverence toward Jesus and God, and NO graphic violence, profanity or sexual content (which is again more than can be said for Gladiator, 300, Titanic or any other movie that is purportedly based on a historical event made these days). And don't let the length scare you off, either. Aside from the acting, which is excellent, the music (by Miklos Rosza, who would score the collossal epic sound version of Ben-Hur 8 years later) is also beautiful.

221911,"Corruption of the New York City police is actually a subject I'm quite interested in as I lived there for many years and had many unpleasant encounters with the NYPD. It is widely known that  unprofessionalism and lax ethics runs rampant to this day throughout the force, and it is readily apparent in the way they treat ordinary citizens on the street to say nothing about protestors, minorities, or at times even elected officials.The best parts of Serpico do a fine job of portraying the subtle and not-so-subtle pushing and prodding, the hazing that goes underway with cops. But Pacino chose to play this part as something of the antithesis of Michael Corleone and I actually found his character rather uncompelling. He kind of does this compromised ""staring of into the distance"" thing with his acting (a man caught in the middle) throughout the film, and then gets annoyed in a couple of scenes. The real Frank Serpico has a nasally, annoying voice and Pacino incorporated this into his character -- but the whole thing comes across as kind of half-baked and even corny -- he's the hepcat hiPpiE cOp. You can tell that everyone at the studio and behind the scenes played up this angle to the extreme. Only it just sits on the surface.So tonally the film is very preachy and way overlong, shot in a kind of docudrama style that has message written all over it. Although Lumet was known for his ""gritty"" style, I have always found it workmanlike. I never got the feel for the energy of New York street of the early 70s from Serpico, nor much of the inspiration for the lead character wanting to be a cop in the first place. This is a ""man in the middle"" film that is so enamored with its theme of urban corruption it just never hits its stride. Serpico does deserve some credit for exposing the despicable behavior of many NYPD cops and its culture, but apparently the book is much better than the film.",Serpico VHS
1494908,"Like the man at the movie`s core, I was hoping to be transported to a different time and place while watching Woody Allen`s universally acclaimed ""Midnight in Paris.""  What I got instead was a sporadically charming but surprisingly earthbound little fantasy that had me pining away over lost opportunities with the Lost Generation.The conceit - not terribly original in and of itself but filled with promise and possibilities - involves an American writer visiting modern-day Paris who is whisked away every midnight to the 1920s where he hobnobs with many of the great writers, artists and thinkers of the time: F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and others.So far, so good.  Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is portrayed as a hopeless romantic who, as we are too often wont to do, believes that life was better in a time before he was born - an idealized era where life was richer, simpler and somehow more satisfying than it is today.  For Gil, that ideal period is the Paris of the 1920s, which he envisions as a scene of endless literary and intellectual discussions amongst a rarified elite.  He's engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a much more prosaic 21st Century woman, whose father (Kurt Fuller) is a right-wing tea-party type and whose mother (Mimi Kennedy) looks with disdain on her daughter's life choices, including the man she`s picked to marry.  No wonder Gil rushes back every night to that space/time continuum portal that allows him to be with the people he really likes and who seem to like and understand him.The main problem for me with ""Midnight in Paris"" is that it is unable to bring its roster of extraordinary historical figures to life.  In fact, they emerge basically as some of the blandest people you are ever likely to meet, this century or last.  They wouldn't even make a good cocktail party crowd.  Not one of them says anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works.  And without that dimension, Gil's trips to the past have all the excitement and authenticity of a dress-up ball that never ends.The scenes set in the present are scarcely any better.  Inez' family and their pompous, know-it-all friend, played by Michael Sheen, are just the Ugly American writ large, and the humor is surprisingly toothless and lacking for a Woody Allen movie.  Wilson, who has been effective in other roles, here feels too much like a stand-in for a younger version of Allen himself to make much of an impression of his own.So what of the glorious views of Paris that one would expect from such a film?  Surely, those are worth the price of admission.  Actually, not really, for the cinematographer, Darius Khonji, has, for some inexplicable reason, seen fit to cast the city in a strangely sickly yellowish glow that robs the place of much of its natural beauty and luster.So what is good about the film?  Well, there are some genuinely tender moments between Gil and Adriana, the on-again/off-again mistress of Pablo Picasso, who suffers from Gil's idealization of the past, only to her, that rosier past lies in the era known as La Belle Epoque.  And there's a very funny in-movie scene in which Gil gives a bemused and befuddled Luis Bunuel the idea for what the surrealist will later turn into ""The Exterminating Angel.""  The movie also does a nice job fleshing out its theme - of the illusion of a Golden Age vs. the reality of a present day - in the final reel.More virtues like these and ""Midnight in Paris"" might have been the truly transporting charmer it was meant to be.",N/A

So nothing is cropped out, all the top and bottom of the picture is shown (the widescreen version crops out the top and bottom when shown in that presentation).

SpongeBob is unfairly passed over for a restaurant management position by his crapulous boss Mr. Krabs in favor of the antisocial, apathetic, but ""mature"" Squidward.  Along with his nearly mindless starfish companion Patrick, he messily buries his depression in endless Goofy Goober sundaes.  Worse, King Neptune freezes Mr. Krabs because the microscopic but devious Plankton (the true thief) frames him for the theft of his baldness-hiding crown.  With the king distracted, Plankton along with his computerized ""wife"" Karen enslaves all of Bikini Bottom with mind-control helmets.  Despite his despair, SpongeBob's loyalty to Mr. Krabs and the community triumph and he, along with Patrick, agree to retrieve the crown, which is ensconced in the unknown land of ""Shell City"".  Can these Goofy Goober kids do it?With sly cleverness, SSM incorporates all the elements of its production into a sort of Greek mythological tale along the lines of ""Jason and the Golden Fleece"" and more saliently, ""The Odyssey"".  SpongeBob and Patrick, like Odysseus, must encounter many dangers, obstacles, and monsters before getting the crown back.  The only difference is, besides ""conventional sea monsters"", they must resist an angler fish with a ""grandma"" lure, hillbilly roadstop diners, and the persistent, vicious Dennis, Plankton's henchman sent to thwart the duo.  Our duo does despair and cry, and are on the verge of giving up.  King Neptune's sympathetic mermaid daughter Mindy gives them fake seaweed mustaches to boost their manhood.  The duo perseveres, but is captured by a ""Cyclops"" (a person in a seadiving, weighted suit), and imprisoned in Shell City (a beach souvenir shop) for dissection.  The crown is there, but can the dessicated SpongeBob and Patrick free themselves, get the crown, avoid Dennis, get back home, and save Bikini Bottom from the ruthless Plankton?  Tears, souvenirs brought to life, and Mr. Hunky Baywatch himself David Hasselhoff may play a part.As I said in the title, SSM is a nice guy's rite of passage.  However, even though he ultimately proves his, er, manliness (spongeworthiness), the most reassuring thing about the movie is that SpongeBob will never lose his most vital asset, his Pollyanna child's heart (or whatever a sponge has for a heart).  Still, he'll have that managerial position, thank you!",The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie
1534804,"This concert was the second of two featuring the Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Andris Nelsons and was held at the Lucerne Festival in September 2011.The program features three major works which together make for a very satisfying program. The concert opens with a performance of Beethoven's Ruins of Athens Overture and which clearly displays Nelson's conducting style as being physically very involved with the music making of the players. It is easy to see why his obvious enthusiasm would encourage considerable levels of commitment from the players and why he has attained such prominence at such a young age.The opening of the concert brings a steady performance of the overture which is markedly slower than either Beecham or Zinman taking two examples on CD from different performing generations for comparison. This preference for slower tempi is also apparent in Scheherazade. This a consequence of Nelson's tendency to linger lovingly over expressive phrases and a desire to bring out a considerable amount of orchestral detail. Admirable though this may well be, and certainly interestingly revealing, the result is to change the character of what is normally a show-piece full of excitement with high levels of adrenaline. As a result, those purchasers essentially looking for emotional fire such as can be found in Reiner's famous CD performance for example, where the final movement was reputably recorded in one scorching take, will not find it here! What they will find though is beautiful playing and a loving performance which may well suit the character of Scheherazade and her intended as opposed to the content of her story material.On the other hand, Bronfman delivers one of the finest performances of the Beethoven 5th concerto on DVD/Blu-ray and is easily the equal of either Barenboim or Buchbinder on their discs of the complete Beethoven piano concertos and is very similar to his own CD interpretation with Zinman. By contrast with either the overture or Scheherazade, the pace is crisply maintained and as usual, Bronfman displays a complete mastery of touch and phrasing leading to much incidental variety without sacrificing drama or forward movement. It may be significant that his exciting and satisfying performance of this concerto and the Chopin etude encore both get by far the most enthusiastic applause of the recorded occasion.The concert finishes with a sparkling performance of a Dvorak Slavonic dance encore which Nelsons conducts well up to tempo and which receives appropriate enthusiastic applause.The recording is of a high visual and sonic standard. The imaging is crisp and detailed and is based on obvious familiarity with the recorded works. The sound is equally fine and is presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1 and stereo.I enjoyed this concert especially for Bronfmann's playing, for the fine orchestral response to all the pieces and the quality of the recorded sound. I will still be returning to several CD performances of the Scheherazade for more exciting renditions though. For my own taste, I can only wholeheartedly recommend this Scheherazade interpretation as an addition to more mainstream performances with offer more obvious drive and overt excitement.I would therefore suggest that this undoubtedly finely played and recorded disc needs to be approached with some caution if your taste is for a red hot Scheherazade with plenty of Russian fire and dramatic drive.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)I particularly like your format of review.

Neil believes his band will become better than U2 (who haven't cut their first album) and he is doing Ivan a favor. Ivan doesn't realize he had a chance to play for what will be the world's most popular band until...Meanwhile, in order to become big, the band gets involved with the Irish mafia. They end up playing strip joints before borrowing money to go to London. Finally near the end of the movie, we understand the title. Neil believes all his problems are caused by Bono...if he could just kill him. The movie title is a hook and has little to do with this extraordinary film, a must for rock fans.Martin McCann did an excellent job playing Bono.

1025127,"I almost don't know where to begin - I research every movie that I can't find a trailer to before purchasing to limit the chance of disasppointment, after  reading about this movie on Wikipedia - I was intrigued beyond all reason in this simply story that blew just about everyone emotionally out of their chairs. The tale of forbidden love between teachers and students is nothing new but the emotional intensity, the psychological tension with the ebb and flow along with the characters just takes your breath away. You may find yourself reminding yourself to breath as your heart hungers for a respect, a love, a connection as great as that of Annabelle and Simone. I am neither teacher nor student but I could tell you in a heartbeat that in watching this - you'll never have to worry about identify with the main characters. There's nothing gratuitous about this which makes it a great change from typical overloaded lesbian fare that borders on softcore porn more often than not. Take a chance and watch this, if you are not as in love with Annabelle and Simone as I was by the closing frame  .  .  . you can be assured that something is broken inside you. If you don't feel the agony at the outcome - if you can't identify with it, then I feel sorry for you.",Loving Annabelle

He wants to get far away from her and the pain, so he chooses to join the French Foreign Legion.His timing couldn't be worse --the Algerian War of Independence (1954-62) was one of the most highly traumatic conflicts for the Foreign Legion.One of the most unique aspects of the FFL is they are the only unit of the French Army open to people of any nationality.While going through some very intense training, Simon becomes friends with  fellow Legionnaires Valdes (Aitor Merino), Dupont (Tom Hardy), and Rodriguez (Javier Alcina).The young men, at first, can't wait to complete their training and go into battle. But as they enter deadly fire fights, ambushes and begin to see the realities of war and politics, they start to wonder, especially Simon.Dupont tries to show Simon it's important to be a soldier, but more important to survive. But Simon has fallen in love again, this time with Nicole (Felicite de Jeu).  At first, the would be lovers, stand on the same side of the Algerian/French conflict. The more war he sees the more he questions his position and who really is his friend, and his foe.Back in real life, Tom Hardy's engagement to actress Charlotte Riley could prove a long one. They have been on again, off again. ""You'd have to ask Charlotte when we're getting married,"" Hardy said.

236595,"This is an early Tom Selleck film, done about the time he was doing Magnum P.I.  It's a period piece set in the days just before the beginning of WW II, and it is well written and the acting by Tom was his absolute best.  Tom plays a high-end jewel thief who gets recruited by the british government and the America's FBI to steal some jewels from the German consulate in Britian, which the Germans plan to use towards their upcoming War effort. It has a great cast that includes Jane Seymour, Laren Hutton, and Bob Hoskins just to mention a few.  This is the first time that this movie has been offered on DVD (something I have been waiting for, for years)and I hope it is followed up by a blu-ray version like they did with Tom Selleck's ""High Road to China"" which was also shot in about the same time period as ""Lassiter"" and another great period piece that Tom did.

1509983,"The film's title ""Drive"" might be misleading. Ryan Gosling's laconic hero is a Hollywood stuntman and garage mechanic by day and getaway driver by night, but car action scenes, superb as they are, are sparse and low-key, compared to, say, ""The Transporter."" Based on a James Sallis book, the film is more like a crime noir about a mysterious man, whose past no one really knows.The storyline itself is not very complicated. Some may say it is conventional. Ryan Gosling plays an unnamed protagonist, a driver wearing a scorpion-embroidered jacket, who befriends his next-door neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos). To help her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), an ex-convict heavily in debt, Gosling's character agrees to do a job for him as a getaway driver.""Drive"" benefits from the capable acting from Ron Perlman and cast-against-type Albert Brooks, but it is excellent Ryan Gosling who carries the show throughout. The film is also memorable for its nice camerawork by Denmark-born director Nicolas Winding Refn (""Pusher"") using the highly stylized lighting. The film's eclectic score is also effective in creating the dark mood.""Drive,"" often bloody and violent, is less about car action stunts (which are very good) than about those characters, whose fates it seems are already sealed before the film begins.",N/A
1112438,"This disc contains an informative documentary which charts Hamelin's preparations for the following concert over several months, weeks, days then hours beforehand. In this he explains his approach to memorising pieces and to developing his eventual interpretation on the night. This is an illuminating documentary that is really useful to watch before the final concert.The concert itself covers a range of styles from Haydn to Gershwin. The Haydn is given a nice crisp interpretation but it is in the Chopin 3rd Sonata that Hamelin's world class status really becomes evident. This is a toweringly effective performance which exists in a world far beyond any technical considerations. The 1st movement is both strong but intensely lyrical. The middle two movements show us just how far Chopin had travelled away from the Classical period of Beethoven into an abstract landscape. The last movement brings the work to a powerful conclusion. This is a far superior performance than his admired CD version in my opinion and adds all the frission and atmosphere of a live occasion to the undoubted technical perfections of the earlier disc.The Debussy Preludes Book 2 inhabits the same rarefied world of music making which would rank with any of the finest performances on record - and there are many, and the concert ends with Hamelin's own left-hand etude 7 followed by two short Gershwin encores. These latter conclude the concert with laughter from the audience as personal communication from Hamelin is added to the considerable musical communications already enjoyed. There is a short bonus item in the form of Hamelin's own Ring-Tone Waltz.The camera work throughout is sharp and detailed and of very good tonal quality. The sound is of equal excellence and is presented in DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo. This is a very fine disc indeed and easily worth the full 5 stars.

75704,"This is a long-waited DVD if you ask me.  Deffenitely.  I think the audio and video qualities of this DVD are much better than previously released VHS videos or LDs.  It is recorded and presented with a wide-screen or a letter-boxed, a high 16:9 aspect ratio picture, together with multiple audios and subtittles.  This DVD packege also includes some newly produced supplimental-interviews with the  writer/director Peter Hyams and other staff members and/or specialists who worked on the film.  Above all, I'd like to point out the fact that it gives us one good audio commentary we can enjoy: that is, the director's audio commentaries. They say that it is very reare for the film's director Peter Hyams to review or make any kind of comments on the movie he produced/wrote/filmed/directed.  He himself was saying he had never commented or recorded them on his picture after they were completed and released because there would have been anything for him to alter or change once they left him.  So, watching and listening to his or others' commentaries themselves worth purchasing this DVD.  Jerry Goldsmith'd famous opening theme music is one another highlight to make this movie even more dramatic and gorgeous.  And its ending; WARNING: I might reveal an important or crucial scene of the movie as the following:  Everytime I see that red Dutsun 280Z sports car, approaching silently form the far-background toward us in the middle of surpposed-to-be a very sad ocassion/situation in the final scene of the movie, I couldn' help myself shedding some tears from my eyes with a joy or rejoyce.  Oh,one more thing to note: Yes, I deffinitely agree with the director's the point  in which he believes this was probably the first mortion picture to feature two flying helicopters as human-like figures, pretending they were talking and nodding face to face each other.  Those made my nerves chilled.  I strongly recomemd to buy this DVD and re-experience the Capricorn incident happened in the late '70s again for yourself.

1401884,"""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" is probably the best of the four ""MI"" installments so far starring Tom Cruise. Again he plays Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent, who finds himself in big trouble (as always). Don't expect here any logic or coherence. ""MIGP' is a roller coaster ride with lots of gadgets and cars, plus occasional humors. Perhaps too many of them, I think, but still I found myself enjoying the ride.Without spoiling too much about the film, ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" follows the story of Ethan Hunt and three agents: William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, reprising his role in""M:i:III""). They have to thwart the heinous plans of one Kurt Hendricks, but this time around without any help from the IMF.After a rather shaky opening the film becomes interesting with set-pieces in Moscow and Dubai. The storyline itself is sometimes contrived, even impossible (by the standards of action movies), but director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"") is a skillful storyteller, who sometimes manages to effectively subvert our expectation when delivering the action scenes.But what is really amazing is the fact Brad Bird delivers the goods despite the deeply flawed script that often seems clich&eacute; and stale. Such ideas as the ""brilliant scientist-turned-dangerous terrorist"" (played by Michael Nyqvist, who was much better as the journalist in the original ""Millennium"" trilogy) and a deadly female assassin (beautiful but slightly wooden L&eacute;a Seydoux) would have been something unbearable in the hands of lesser talent.Yes, Brad Bird knows they are only ""Macguffin"" (or ""Rabbit's Foot"" if you like) - a plot device for a story. Luckily he knows how to use it, keeping the pace fast, not taking the film too seriously. Enjoy it.",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

Moments before you can carry out your plan, however, you see a young girl in need of your help. Do you go to her aid? If your answer is no, you just shortened this movie by about 98%.When we first meet Luke Wright (played by Jason Statham), he's won a mixed martial arts bout that the Russian mob ""encouraged"" him to lose. An easy enough task given the fact that he already had a losing record. After they assault him, he believes the worst is behind him. That proves to be false when he returns home to find members of the same Russian mob have killed his girlfriend (or wife, I'm not entirely sure and the information sources I've checked are silent on the matter). Rather than kill him, he's left as the prime suspect in the homicide and told to leave the mob's territory. On the other side of the world, a ten year-old Chinese student named Mei (played by Catherine Chan in her first feature film) demonstrates an exceptional gift for remembering numbers regardless of length or complexity. When the nature of her gift becomes common knowledge in her hometown, she becomes the ward of a local businessman with consent of her father whose hands are full thanks to her mother's serious illness. The businessman is a member of the Triads, Chinese organized crime for those who are unfamiliar, and intends to use her gift in America in lieu of written or computer files, as both can be seized by law enforcement. In time, they trust her unflinchingly and ask her to remember a very long number and relay it to the Russians who will give her another number to bring back. But when her escorts are shot en route to the Russians, she runs and they chase her. She makes it to the subway where a despondent Luke (Statham) subdues her pursuers and makes himself the one man in New York who the Triads, the Russians, and the NYPD officers on their payroll all want dead.Now, I like Jason Statham. While I don't own copies of any film in  either the Transporter series or the Crank series, I do own DVDs of The Mechanic and Death Race despite the fact that both films received generally negative reviews from the majority of critics.

Then this cartoon came along. Being a scifi geek I gravitated towards it. It continues where the books ended with Holmes and Moriarty dying together over a waterfall but instead Holmes managed to save himself. He continued his career in secret until he died at a ripe old age. His remains, which were perserved in honey, are reanimated in the future when it turns out 22nd century criminals have cloned Moriarty. Inspector Lestrad is replaced by his great great great granddaughter and lovable Dr. Watson is replaced by an android with his complete works and journals downloaded in it's harddrive. The three then track Moriarty and solve various cases modeled after each original Holmes story... Hounds of Baskervilles, The Red Headed League, etc. with a futuristic twist. Great for kids who love scifi and want to try a little classic literature too and great for adults because it's still quite intelligent and very entertaining. My only complaint about this wonderful show is it didn't last longer. Enjoy.Funny Fact: Doyle never intended to write the last Sherlock Holmes book. He wanted to leave the characters of Holmes and Moriarty in an eternal chase..one never catching the other as a metaphor for the never ending struggle of good and evil.

His wife Hallie (Vera Miles) is with him.Senator Stoddard tells about when he first arrived in the territory (which I don't think was ever named) with a brand new law diploma, a bag of law books, and some $14 and change. The stagecoach was held up by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his gang. Valance is a vicious killer who carries a silver-handled bullwhip and has a slightly hysterical sidekick who sounds like he's ready to come as he watches Valance whip people. They beat up on Rance Stoddard when he tries to defend the other passenger, a widow who does not want to give up the brooch her husband gave her.Tom Doniphon and his man Pompey find Rance on the trail and bring him to Hallie at the Swedes' restaurant where she is a waitress. Hallie is Tom's girl. (Note that she eventually married Stoddard.) When Rance has recovered sufficiently to do so, he takes up washing dishes for the Swedes to pay his rent. (He's sleeping on the couch in the kitchen.) He makes a shingle to hang announcing ""Ransom Stoddard Attorney at Law"" and Mr. Peabody, the editor and publisher of the Shinbone Star, agrees to let him hang it up outside the newspaper office.Rance discovers that Hallie has never learned to read, and offers to teach her. In fact, he ends up starting a school. Marshall Link Appleyard (Andy Devine) has all his children by his Mexican wife in the school. There seems to be at least a dozen. But who can run a school with Liberty Valance menacing everything? Rance has been secretly practicing with a gun, and when Tom discovers this, he offers to teach him. However, he plays a trick on Rance that gets him covered in white paint. Tom has discovered that Rance is his rival for Hallie's attention, and he tries to intimidate Rance with his superior shooting and says that Hallie's his girl.Shinbone holds a meeting to nominate two delegates to the statehood convention, which is a hot contest between the cattlemen north of the Picket Wire (which I think is a river), and the farmers and townsmen south of the Picket Wire. Valance has been out recruiting bad guys to throw a fear into the farmers in support of the cattlemen. Valance shows up at the meeting, and even though he's told he doesn't live in the region involved, he bullies his way in and has two of his henchmen nominate and second him for delegate. Rance Stoddard and Mr. Peabody are also nominated. Obviously, nobody votes for Valance except his henchmen. Stoddard and Peabody are to be the delegates. Valance challenges Rance to be outside alone with a gun that night, or he will come and drag him out of the Swedes' place.Valance and his henchmen trash the newspaper office and beat Peabody to within an inch of his life. In fact, I thought he was dead until he showed up at the statehood convention.There are some secrets here, and I won't give them away. Suffice it to say this is not your typical western, even though the cast list might make it sound like one. It is in fact a very interesting and thoughtful look at how the west grew up.",N/A

I could cheat and read the books as I'm really dying to know what happens next, but I don't know if that would just mess up stuff like the Ned-reveal in the second-to-last episode or what was to happen with Dany and Khal Drogo or even how the fate of Robert would affect everything midway through (I am still suspicious of his ""accident!""). So, there are two sides. The side of me that wants to read the books knowing that there is probably a lot more story in them with richer character descriptions and plot that had to be cut out for television. Then, there's the other side that LOVED seeing it filmed and wants to be surprised. I just don't know. It's such a perfect TV show that if the book isn't AS perfect, I'd feel let down.Anyway, big five stars for ""Game of Thrones."" Best show I've ever, ever seen.

It's just not half as interesting when you already know exactly what's gonna happen and that cost a couple of points alone.I rate movies with certain point scale and being a movie where re-watching it is maybe a third as entertaining as the initial viewing takes away any buying potential period.Now, I'm not saying this applies to all movies with a great twist but generally if you know Bruce is dead in the Sixth Sense there is virtually no rason to watch the movie hoping to be entertained in a major way.Ditto with Cabins in the Woods.It is awesome that they even tried something like this and it's a twist that more or less can't be guessed as it's so far off the ususal horror crap however try watching it again and try to pretend it was even half as good as the first time you watch it...I dare you.Walking out of the movies I was pretty sure I would buy this when it came out...after watching again I think I can do without.However I would agree you need to watch this at least once.PSIf your like me you'll probably find yourself pausing at a few scenes near the end just to catch all the bloody action on the screen.

173419,"What can I say about this film? It captures the height of sci-fi/fantasy cinema during the late 1970s/early 1980s in all of its glory. The three kids all pull off their parts wonderfully (this movie was easily Drew Barrymore's best role). E.T. comes across as extremely convincing, largely due to the excellent puppet used.And about that puppet - in 2002, Spielberg made a few CG enhancements to the movie. I think most of the changes were for the better. Sometimes the CG E.T. looks a bit too C.G., but other times CG does enable him to exhibit a greater range of facial expressions. I think much of it still works because the actors used the original C.G. puppet, so they were able to give better performances than would have been possible otherwise.I also think replacing the guns with walkie-talkies was an acceptable move. While I don't care much for being politically correct, it always did seem a bit odd to me that NASA agents were chasing a bunch of kids while brandishing rifles. They obviously didn't plan to shoot the kids, otherwise they would have. Either way, Spielberg includes the 1982 original version - unlike Lucas - so you can enjoy the movie either way.During the Cold War, the U.S. showed Soviet defectors this movie to introduce them to the potential and imagination of the American way of life. Nowadays, I wish more producers would revisit this movie to try to recapture some of that movie magic we kids enjoyed during there 1980s.UPDATE (1/7/12): I finally had a chance to watch the blu-ray version. The movie looks great in blu-ray. Not a dramatic change, but I also bet most kids would never believe the movie was made 30 years ago. However, the set only includes the original release, not the 2002 special edition. I'm personally indifferent between the two, but there are changes in the 2002 version I liked and was sad to see them go (particularly the bathtub scene). I think Spielberg saw what happened to Lucas and Star Wars and decided to play it a bit too safe. However, the movie as is is still wonderful.",N/A

1576479,"When the original movie COMA was released to theaters an entire generation was put into a state of panic when it came to undergoing simple surgery. The idea of surgery is scary enough but to consider the thought that someone at the hospital would put you into a coma on purpose so they could harvest your organs for the highest bidder? My guess is the number of people who signed on to ""organ donor"" cards that year plummeted. Believe it or not that was 34 years ago and it seems that there is a new generation who has no idea what the story of COMA is. That is until they watch this new mini-series just released on DVD.The story revolves around a med student studying to become a surgeon by the name of Susan Wheeler (Lauren Ambrose). It helps that her family helped establish the hospital she's doing her residency in, but Susan has to pull her own weight as well. Just having a name won't get you past doctors trying to push you to the limit.Things get a little odd when a friend of Susan's in for a routine operation suddenly crashes on the operating table and goes into a coma. No one can explain why this happened and she is eventually sent to a long term care facility called The Jefferson Institute. But this doesn't comfort Susan much. She continues to search for a reason for her friend's sudden comatose state, a search that eventually causes two different people who provide her with information to lose their jobs.Running parallel to this story is a bright young surgeon who is Susan's instructor as well, Dr. Mark Bellows (Steven Pasquale). Bellows is having an affair with a psychologist and hospital head, Dr. Lindquest (Geena Davis). As he instructs Susan and eventually joins her crusade to find out what's going on, Lindquest becomes jealous and threatens his position. It's not enough to stop him or Susan from digging deeper.As Susan checks the records she discovers that there has been an abnormal amount of comas at her hospital, enough that one would think and investigation would have begun. But doctors and the heads of the hospital circle the wagons and not only prevent an investigation but threaten to expel Susan as well. To her rescue comes the star doctor of the hospital and their biggest money maker when it comes to fundraising, Dr. Stark (James Woods). When Stark takes gets involved with Susan's investigation things take a turn for the worse. Sorry, no spoiler here I won't reveal anything involving Stark.The more Susan digs into the reason for the comas and their connection to The Jefferson Institute, the darker things become. Just who is involved and how far up the chain of command this conspiracy goes is anyone's guess and as viewers we find ourselves with plenty of possible bad guys to choose from. From Susan's point of view there is almost no one she can trust and even those she does she has to wonder about. When an attempt is made on her life rather than give up she continues searching for answers.If you've seen the original then you already know what is going on behind the scenes. If you haven't then you'll probably not want to watch this before scheduling surgery any time soon. The story itself is a tight thriller that keeps you guessing until the end.That being said it worked better the first time around. Contained in a film just under 2 hours it works better and doesn't overload you with far too much information or quantity of possible suspects. As a four hour mini-series it takes us places that don't matter that just seem to fill time and cause you to forget who is who and just why they're important to the story. The pacing isn't near as frantic and the thrill aspect of the story doesn't really kick in until the last 20 minutes of more. The original kept a pace going from half way through until the very end of the film.This is not to say that this version is terrible. It's just, well, different. That's one of the problems with remakes; those of us who remember the original find ourselves unconsciously comparing the two each and every minute of the film. If this is your first exposure to this story then you'll find plenty to hold your interest. If you recall the first version, this one holds up okay but you'll find it slower than that one. Either way, it makes for an interesting story and worth the price of a rental.",N/A

1400778,"In a decade of remakes by Hollywood, this is one of many that pales in comparison to the originals.  This version of Conan follows a different story-line than the original two Schwarzenegger films.  Here, we see an origins story of Conan, from birth to childhood, to his learning how to use and forge a sword, the destruction of his family, and his pursuit of revenge.  All throughout are graphic fight scenes high on blood on low on gore.  The special effects are good, though not original.  The dialogue is plain, enough to get the ideas across but nothing inspirational.  The biggest letdown are the lack of comedy and the boring soundtrack.  The original Conan movies had a steady mix of subtle and overt humor; whether it be the camel spitting on Conan, or Conan knocking himself out on a tree.  Not this movie, Jason Momoa's Conan is just serious, as are all the other characters.  Everybody is either wanting to kill or avoid getting killed.  This film's soundtrack was also lackluster with no memorable tunes.  This is quite unlike the first two movies, which was good background music appropriate for each scene.  Overall, another example of a film undone with a lackluster script to follow.",N/A
980395,"No one would ever expect ""Thunder Birds"" to win an Academy Award. This short (78-minute) 1942 film is, at best, a decent piece of propaganda that may have inspired young viewers to join the U.S. Army Air Corps when it was released in 1942, just a few months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor plunged America into World War II. Director William Wellman filmed ""Thunder Birds"" on location at a USAAC flight training base in Arizona, and the harsh desert scenery is awesome in Technicolor. Preston Foster plays Steve Britt, a tough-as-nails civilian instructor pilot with a heart of gold who gives his students every break possible to turn them into skilled pilots. John Sutton gives a low-key but effective performance as Royal Air Force flight student Peter Stackhouse, whose fear of flying threatens to wash him out of the training program. The lovely Gene Tierney is Kay, the woman they both love. Of course, you can imagine the romantic triangle that ensues...As with most films of this type, a lot of peripheral activities surround the flight sequences. Talking, horseback riding, barn-dancing and barbecue eating probably take up at least half of the film--I didn't time it exactly. But the aerial action makes up for its relative brevity with great quality. There are a few shots of Vultee BT-13 ""Valiant"" basic trainers (known disparagingly as the ""Vultee Vibrator"") and North American AT-6 ""Texan"" advanced trainers. But most of the aerial scenes involve PT-17 ""Stearman"" primary trainers. Virtually all American World War II pilots, whether assigned to fighters, bombers or transports (and many foreign pilots also, as ""Thunder Birds"" depicts) had their first flying lessons in these venerable blue-and-yellow biplanes with red-and-white-striped rudders (13 stripes, symbolizing the 13 original Colonies). The scenes of these graceful aircraft soaring above the desert are stunning. And they're the real thing--I've flown in all three of these aircraft types, and there are no special effects here. Other than for a few close-up shots of the pilots, the aerial action really happens as shown.In all, ""Thunder Birds"" is a feel-good film made when the worst war in history raged in Europe and Asia, and when America seemed isolated, alone and not at all certain to prevail over the Axis powers. Viewers of the time surely drew inspiration from its scenes of dozens of aircraft roaring through the air in tight formation, and from its depictions of the fresh young kids who were signing up in droves to answer their nations' needs. The breadth and scope of America's wartime mobilization is on full view in ""Thunder Birds,"" and even today's jaded, cynical viewers can get a thrill seeing so many of these now-historic aircraft in flight. With so few of them flying today, it's worth it for the aviation buff to see this film just for these scenes. I highly recommend it if you're interested in classic aircraft, military flight training or 1940s-vintage Hollywood stars.",N/A
1177375,"I was hoping for a second season with the truckers hauling more goods back on the same roads as season 1, but these guys tend to go where they're needed, transporting supplies to the natural gas rigs ACROSS THE ARCTIC OCEAN!!! One of the rigs is a bust and is being relocated and these truckers are the ones who make the move driving over barely 35 inches of ice, which is all that stands between them and their 40-ton loads(sometimes heavier)and more than 120 feet of water. It isn't like Season 1, where there are ""land bridges"" and driving over 60-feet deep lakes. The entire ROUTE is nothing but the frozen waters of the MacKenzie River and the Arctic Ocean itself!I was hoping that Drew would make a comeback much better than Season 1, but he ends up quitting on the first day due to his impatience in waiting for a load to come in, and ends up driving a box truck around town much of the time, but he DOES end up making 9 trips across the ice anyway in a semi-truck doing grocery runs. Some would call this rather pathetic comparing to what the other guys would haul, but people gotta eat too! And he still takes the risk of running through the ice especially when it gets warmer and the ice is melting everywhere.Hugh made the most trips, an astonishing 67, and beating the top scorer there by one more load. Most of these trips were made with some kind of vacumn truck, a VAC truck as they call it, emptying waste tanks and stuff, and one review even criticized Hugh for not having the better loads, but he's getting paid just the same and also taking the same risks, and it's a big improvement to the environment considering that the waste tanks HAVE to be emptied somehow. Hugh will take the dirty jobs, but you can tell his pride won't let him go low enough to be like Drew going around town in a 1-ton box truck.Alex is the one I was concerned about. He did some 20-odd trips across the ice, not complaining a single bit like Rick obviously was doing the entire season, and Alex was the one who wasn't in top shape with his health either. He gets lost across the ice missing a turn and doesn't even complain about that either! He only brought the matter of his declining health to the attention of the others when it was apparent that he couldn't make one more load without it being a serious hazard to his health with his increasing illness. He is evacuated and taken back to Yellowstone, the rest of the season being a washout for him. Hugh even shows great concern for his friend by showing up for him in the hospital to be by his side.Rick was quite the restless one this season. He'd take his truck bouncing across the ice at excessive speeds. ""They told me to drive at whatever I was comfortable with."" he explains with a grin, and you see him bouncing around his cab at those speeds, but he didn't take into consideration the fact that his TRUCK wouldn't be as comfortable taking it to the limit on those roads, and he spends some time off the road while an oil pan replacement has to be flown in for his truck, a considerable delay. He complains about the delays, complains that he's not being treated fairly, and even while grudgingly doing jobs like hauling garbage and dirty snow, he even has a bit of a Good Samaritan in him as he goes out of his way to personally help out a fellow trucker who finds out his heater is no longer working in -40 temperatures. He shadows the guy's truck and stops several times with his truck as dead-weight on the ice so the distressed trucker can go to his cab and warm up instead of freezing to death. THAT is friendship right there! But Rick gets FIRED on the LAST DAY of the season due to his impatience when his incoming cargo for the last run can't seem to get onto his flatbed trailer. Should have learned to use a winch after all, right???I give this season 5 stars. And only because I can't put on six or seven stars. Quite enjoyable!",Ice Road Truckers: Season 2

The poor mite had to stay in character / keep returning to depressing ponnette for TWO years in order for us adults to be able to sit through the movie. Why? Because 5yr olds cannot act. Even 7 or 8yr oles are problematic. They can however play themselves and themes to do with childhood. See ""Lord of the Flies ""where the children fully understood the dynamics of bullying or they could choose a boy with an innate fascination for biology besides his film character. But 5yr old? Children are too ego-centric to get into another skin. No wonder she looks somber for real. This is the girl who grew up with a phobia for ponies? Did she smile when the directer said 'cut! ?Reaction to grief that age they cry and bury but it is surprising how elastic their minds are. With empathy from adults .Young kids live in the moment after all and death is not mental abuse. Show them a dead animal or story of a dead pet they can and do catch on. Why a film that dwells on possible immediate aftermath if father lacked empathy?But the dragged out maudelin process of this film is all about adults projecting their trips into small children. This is part of a new culture of child-rearing from mid 20th century where kids are babied and cossetted more and longer than they need be. Better for the kid? Not really but strangely cossetting for the parent. And so this infliction of grief on a ponette is absurdly self indulgent. At a pinch is it all about an adult softly chewing over the preciousness of their feelings than watching something in kid-land. Something the French at their worse may be more susceptible to do.Even the sound of spoken French lends itself to this indulgence. And somewhere in the extras of ""lord of the flies"" its noted the film never caught on in France because lack of cosseting and yet the children adapt without adults not sit on the beach bawling their eyes out till a rescue ship arrives.Ponette is both a baby and an adult. Too much of both qualities. Ditto oversentimental adults taking themselves far too seriously. Was it Oscar Wilde who said what kills art is over-earnestness?For example ,near start of film, seeing the same age little boy kiss and hug ponnette like a sexless teen Romeo or full fledged adult was the first sure bad omen and no I did not watch till the end.

255387,"First things first; `The Towering Inferno' is a really good movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed this, as did my wife, and getting her to embrace a film pre-1990 is really difficult.  I'm not usually drawn to these classic disaster epics because they have a tendancy of being really corny in execution and so I wasn't really keen on seeing the film despite the marvelous cast (seriously, has there ever been a better cast than this?) but I caved in when I realized that it was up for a slew of Oscars, including Best Picture.  That doesn't always say much, but I decided it was best to see this.I'm really glad that I did.Before I get into all the reasons I'm glad I watched this, I will lay out a few problems and the reason that this won't get a five-star review from me.First of all, conceptually this wasn't thought out enough.  To have a fire spark HOURS before it is really noticed is somewhat silly, especially when it is in a closet a mere few feet away from a secretary who should have smelled the fire.  I mean, it takes hours before the fire spreads past a small flame and for smoke to start billowing into the hallway.  It didn't make sense.  They should have just had the fire spark during the party and spread rapidly.  Continuing with plot issues, the film recycles some of the film's thrills too much and drags out the finale to a fault, serving up some questionable logic.  Second, the film is just too long.  It needed to be trimmed.  Not that it doesn't do a whole lot, and it wears it's near three hour running length well, but it still comes across very longwinded and needed some temperance with regard to the film's actual length.  Sadly, despite the running length, there is very little character development.  A few actors shine in their role (NOT Astaire, who's Oscar nomination is baffling to me), but no one really has much depth thanks to a script that doesn't care enough to make these people important.Still, with those glaring faults, the film is a whole lot of fun and almost all technical aspects of the film are prefect.  The cinematography win was WELL deserved, so rich and epic in scope without sacrificing the smaller details.  The production design, especially those set pieces of wrecked hallways and stairwells, are pitch perfect, and the costuming (Dunaway is stunning) is a lot of fun.  The special effects are top notch, even for today, and the overall ensemble is on point, especially McQueen, Holden and Chamberlain, who all brought an extra fire to underwritten roles (if ANYONE was going to get some sort of awards attention here, it should have been Richard Chamberlain).At the end of the day, `The Towering Inferno' sends chills and remains intense throughout.  It could have been tightened, but regardless, this is a disaster epic that earns the reputation it still has.",N/A
757900,"After re-watching a dozen episodes from The Dick Van Dyke Show, I changed my mind and decided that I should, after all, write an Amazon review for the series. Not because I think too many people will see my review, which will undoubtedly be hidden beneath multiple pages of previously-posted reviews. Not because I think Amazon readers need any more recommendations to get this set after reading the scores of such recommendations already present. Not even because it would be fun to reminisce as I wrote the review about everything I liked about the show over the years. No, I decided to write this review because, after re-watching these classic episodes again, I realized afresh that The Dick Van Dyke Show is one of the best, perhaps THE best, comedy series I've ever seen, and if even a single person watches this show for the first time because of this review, the effort would be entirely justified.There are lots of funny TV shows, but I can't think of any that have affected me like The Dick Van Dyke Show has. My childhood is filled with the memories of watching the show with my father as I grew up. We sat there together, laughing out loud, over and over again, day after day, and felt like we were special guests to be asked into Rob and Laura Petrie's family each week. But were these childhood memories just a figment of my passing childhood, laughs that would disappear with time and a new social context? Not one bit. As I watch these shows in sparkling, crystal-clear DVD format (the ""DVD"" being no relation to ""Dick Van Dyke""!), I find myself laughing - and enjoying - these episodes as if I never saw them before. And even when I have the jokes and the sequences memorized - and for many of them, I do - I can find no other reaction other than to laugh out loud as I did when I was kid. This is a downright, flat-out funny, witty, enjoyable, and entertaining program.Can comedy be funny without resort to off-color language? Can shtick and physical humour actually be supremely hilarious? Can an element of sophistication be woven into comedy so that the audience can laugh at itself without being insulted? Can timeless themes be woven into stories that actually entertain? One needs watch only a handful of Dick Van Dyke Show episodes easily to quickly affirm each of these questions. And perhaps more impressively, its easily apparent that the cast and crew pull this off silky ease, belaying the true work that was put into the show. There's no question about it: the writing, the plot lines, the acting, and the personal charm of those involved in The Dick Van Show set a standard apart from others, a standard that sees no wear from the ravages of time. It doesn't matter that we are watching black-and-white in a clearly post-1950's suburban home and work setting: we see color and modernity even as we look right through these unimportant backdrops. The themes and talent that pours out of nearly every episode is unaffected by time, setting, and costume.I once heard Carl Reiner say that Dick Van Dyke was the most talented entertainer he had ever known. It's hard to disagree with him once we've seen the show. Van Dyke is like Rowan Atkinson, but in spades, and with an inner charm that endears the watcher. He can sing, he can dance, he can tell jokes with precision timing, he can use understatement as a weapon, and he can make us totally sympathetic to his plights without appearing whiny. Rob Petrie, but more importantly, Dick Van Dyke, strikes us as an intensely decent person imbued with a joy of life that pervades everything he does. Actually, we are CONVINCED he is an intensely decent person, and we are just there for the ride as we watch him move through life with all its comic ups and downs. He could have never done it without Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, and Mary Tyler Moore (not to mention all the others who worked on the show before the camera), but Van Dyke stands out as that supremely gifted individual, a talent amongst a group of talents, Holland's gift to America. That so many gifted individuals could work together without stepping on each other's toes is a miracle in itself. It's an assemblage of people rarely seen, and I fear, not to be seen again for a long time.Season One gets off to a rocky start. In retrospect, we can see the show is trying to figure out itself, trying to understand how all the pieces work together, trying to determine how stories are to be assembled for best impact. The show was slated for cancellation twice that year, and only after Sheldon Leonard stepped in to rescue it - and a change of time slot for Season Two right after the successful Beverly Hillbillies - did the show take off.But in Season Two, the show takes off like no rocket you've ever seen before. Season One has some strong episodes and great plot ideas, but it's Season Two that sees the cast working in a seamless, slick, and sophisticated manner that turns the show into a timeless classic. It's almost as if everyone involved realized they were given a second chance, and with that, the gloves came off, the worries were put aside, and everyone just got ""into the groove."" The show knocked out one outstanding episode after another, and by the time Season Five occurred, everyone knew that this might likely be the highlight of their careers. The show was ended at the height of it's popularity because of Reiner's insistence - he said he did not want to show to die slowly, but go out while at the top of form - and we can only wonder what a ""Season Six"" might have held for us. But it's no matter. These are comedic masterpieces at the top of form, a goal for others to try and match, and a standard by which all others are measured.If you've never seen The Dick Van Dyke Show and wonder what it is about, I'll tell you. It's about a somewhat charmed life of a regular group of people who are talented, happy, and good natured and who face the normal problems, irritation, and strange events that are a part of nearly everyone's life. That's all you need to know. Start with Season Two and work forward from there. When you are done, go back to Season One and see how they figured it all out in those early months. But by then, you'll already be won over by the many wonderful episodes, and will doubtless be re-watching these over and over again. Millions of people of have done so over the years. To watch these episodes is to easily understand why.",The Dick Van Dyke Show: Season 1
98935,"""Deliverance,"" John Boorman's adaptation of James Dickey's first novel, stars Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox. It's the story of four suburban Atlanta men who go on a weekend canoe trip that turns into a nightmare in the remote backwoods of rural Georgia.One of the friends is big on machismo, but the others are far from up to such a rough journey and would be more at home in a recliner, remote control in one hand, a beer in the other. Yet they persevere, heading deeper into the woods and into dark adventures they never anticipated.  Boorman and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond capture the wilderness of forest and river, creating a sense of foreboding as the men make their journey. The dueling banjos sequence between an inbred mountain boy and Cox, the inexperience of the city slickers, and the white water power of the river all foreshadow danger that lurks in the woods.Though the movie is essentially an action thriller, Boorman infuses elements of terror, not the mad slasher or supernatural variety, but very real rednecks intent on having some malevolent amusement at the expense of the four outsiders. These scenes are the strongest in the movie and take the film to a completely different level.  It's no longer a male-bonding weekend in nature, but a life-and-death fight for survival.""Deliverance"" is one of the best films of the 1970's and the picture that made Reynolds a major movie star, a role he would enjoy for the next ten years.The new Blu-ray 40th Anniversary Edition contains commentary by John Boorman, a four-part retrospective, the vintage featurette ""The Dangerous World of Deliverance,"" theatrical trailer, and a 44-page book containing behind-the-scenes photos and production information.",N/A

222120,"What would you do if you had complete power and absolute control of another human being?  That was a question asked in the movie ""Caligula"".  What would you do if you had the power of life and death? I believe the question to be relevant here as well.Basically, this movie is about black slaves getting caught up in the games that the white slave owners are playing amongst themselves.  More often than not, the slaves end up victims and their lot in life follow the fortunes (and misfortunes) of their masters.  The story takes place in the South, on a plantation owned by Warren Maxwell.The distinguished actor, James Mason, plays Warren Maxwell.  A young Perry King plays his son, Hammond.  British actress Susan George plays Blanche.  And boxer Ken Norton plays the role of Mede, the Mandingo.Getting on in years, Maxwell wants his only son (Hammond) to provide him a grandson so they can keep the family line going as well as to have someone in line to inherit the plantation.  The younger Maxwell goes to town and picks up a woman to be his wife.  The audience knows right away that the woman, Blanche, is just trouble waiting to happen.  Hammond and Blanche agree to marry.  On their first bedding, Hammond realizes that Blanche is not a virgin.  Blanche throws a tantrum and insists that she was until that night.  While in town, Hammond also purchases a couple of slaves.  A woman ""bed wench"" and a muscular male slave called Mede.  Eventually, he takes them all back to his father's plantation.Hammond and Mede develop a fondness for one another.  Meanwhile, Blanche has taken to the bottle and spends most of her days in a drunken stupor.  Hammond trains Mede for the fighting ring.  In return, Mede shows his loyalty by giving it all he has in the fighting ring for his master Hammond.  The elderly Hammond spends his days trying to transfer the pain of his gout and his arthritis to his house boy.  Meanwhile, Hammond avoids his wife and instead beds his black women, leaving Blanche unfulfilled.  Now, as you can see, this is a recipe for trouble.  And trouble does indeed come to the plantation.This is a good movie.  It was made during the middle of the 1970s, when blaxploitation was a very popular film genre.  This is blaxploitation, not ""Roots""!  And the humiliation and the degradation of black slaves are depicted in a way that is very excessive and over-the-top.  Sexual exploitation is always a present part of the theme and the plot.  The sleaze factor is there.  I am reminded of the movie ""Caligula"".  There is a sequel called ""Drum"".  Although it is not a direct sequel in terms of plot, the character of Hammond Maxwell returns (this time played by Warren Oates).",Mandingo VHS

717659,"If you take a look at plenty of reviews for the film you'll notice it seems that a good portion seemed to rather dislike Unhinged. I disagree completly with the negative reviews of this one. I find Unhinged despite being flawed in various ways to be an interesting and often creepy slasher film. Now let's get the flaws out of the way. First off Unhinged is extremely poorly acted by pretty much everyone in the film aside from the actress who plays Marion. They spit out silly dialogue left and right and seem as if they are sleepwalking or just flat out bored by acting in this film. If only the film had better actors we'd  have a possible perfect film but in some ways the bad actors do give a certain bad movie charm to the film. Another problem is the pacing of the film. Though I thought the film was highly enjoyable many others think it's talky and slow. Some scenes do linger on a bit too long but that's an amateur filmmaker for you. They never know where to edit and Unhinged does suffer a bit from this but like mentioned I didn't mind a bit. The conversations were interesting at least to me. Plus they were usually odd enough to keep you interested. Now those are pretty much the 2 major flaws the film has. Other then that Unhinged is a creepy unnerving film with a terrific atmosphere and oddly enough an original enough storyline. It's very easy to see where the director was going and he really for the most part accomplished his goal. He clearly wanted to make a slasher film that focused on the suspense rather then a bodycount. If only he fixed a few flaws.Now Unhinged does have a shocking final twist and it's a real good one that truly does make the film 100 percent more effective. One film, a year later did the same twist in a slightly different way. That film went on to be far more known then Unhinged ever became but in it's own right Unhinged did this twist as well as that film did.Unhinged overall is a creepy film with a knockout final twist. It suffers from poor acting and some pretty awful editing but it is quite an effective film.Well worth a watch for slasher fans.",Unhinged

I was thrilled to pick this movie up on Amazon, and it was pretty good.The overall plot of the movie, involves Lupin and the gang trying to steal a national treasure from an ruthless 3rd world country dictator/general. Along the way, Lupin meets up with some allies, and as usual, he meets up with the Femme Fatale' Fujiko. I won't spoil the story, but overall the plot ws pretty engaging. Personally, I found that the plots from ""Castle of Cagliostro"" and ""Farewell to Nostradamus"" a bit more engaging and captivating, but this movie is still very enjoyable.The english voice acting for this movie is pretty good. For some weird reason, my opinion always hinges on performance of the actor potraying Jiggen, perhaps because he is my favorite character. I think the actor in this movie did a worlds better than the actor in the ""Casle of Cagliostro"" , but not quite as good as the actor in ""Farewell to Nostradamus.""This disc is distributed by Funimation, and unlike my previous Lupin movie from them, the disc was in great condition, and worked perfectly.

1056047,"The most deliciously featherlight of Jane Austen's novels, NORTHANGER ABBEY combines the authors' signature class observations with a parody of the penny-thrillers which were the secret guilty pleasure for many during the era.  This version, broadcast in 2007 as part of a special season of new Jane Austen dramatisations for ITV, will satisfy those who didn't care for the BBC's 1987 attempt, which has divided Austen-philes for years.Eighteen-year-old Catherine Morland (Felicity Jones) leaves her family's country home to stay with old friends Mr and Mrs Allen for a holiday in Bath.  There, Catherine's innocent demeanour attracts the attention of warm-hearted Henry Tilney (JJ Feild - ""The Sally Lockhart Mysteries"") and his sister Eleanor (Catherine Walker);  but also falls prey to the subtle manipulations of Isabella Thorpe (Carey Mulligan - ""Bleak House""), a young woman who insists that she cares little for money but whose actions show otherwise.  When Henry's father General Tilney (Liam Cunningham) invites Catherine to travel back with his family to their ancestral estate of Northanger Abbey, Catherine's vivid imagination - fed on a steady diet of pulp fiction gothic thrillers for years - goes into overdrive conjuring up all manner of terrifying family secrets stored within it's walls.This is altogether a far more satisfying screen treatment of Jane Austen's story, and that is mainly due to Andrew Davies' script, which retains a strong flavour of the original novel.  One of the main failings of the 1987 BBC version was a tendency to fight against its source (eg: a bizarre 80's New Age-wannabe soundtrack, several extra characters added for no particular reason).  Period drama fans know they are always in good hands with Andrew Davies (""Vanity Fair"", ""Wives and Daughters"", ""Daniel Deronda"", ""Bleak House"", 2008's ""Sense and Sensibility"", not to mention his magnum opus, the 1995 ""Pride & Prejudice""), but whilst NORTHANGER ABBEY is the one Austen story which can comfortably be retold within the span of a regular movie length, I truly hope that one day we'll see a longer miniseries incarnation.  Saying that, I particularly enjoyed the bookending narration provided by ""Jane Austen"" herself - a charming addition; and Davies has captured the characters with his usual skill.Performances are fantastic.  1987's Katharine Schlesinger was, in my opinion, the strongest component of that otherwise-iffy screen version, but I adored Felicity Jones' performance as Catherine.  She is all you could possibly want and is perfectly-paired with JJ Feild's adorable Henry (Peter Firth he ain't - and that's a good thing here).  Carey Mulligan offers a coy and coolly manipulative Isabella.  Mrs Allen is played with a great comedic flair by Sylvestra Le Touzel - well-known to period drama fans as Fanny Price in the BBC's 1983 miniseries of ""Mansfield Park"", as well as Lady Jane Crawley in Andrew Davies' 1998 ""Vanity Fair"".All in all a charming new NORTHANGER ABBEY.  Buyers should be aware however that the DVD released in the States by PBS/Masterpiece is an edited version which removes several small scenes.  The uncut version is available on DVD from the UK.",N/A

1465456,"Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that as Denzel Washington gets older he's playing more and more characters with killer instincts? In SAFE HOUSE, Washington once more plays a character that you hope you never find tracking you down or waiting in your home.The film opens with Washington meeting a member of MI6, Britain's spy agency, and receiving a microchip filled with information. Heading to the bathroom of the restaurant they're in, he injects it into his hip. When the bad guys come knocking on the restroom door Washington dispatches them with ease and escapes. The MI6 agent picks him up in his car but before they can get away he's shot. Washington makes his escape to the American consulate and turns himself in.We discover that Washington's name is Tobin Frost, an ex-CIA agent who went off the grid and has been selling secrets to various organizations around the world. Considered a traitor, the consulate turns out to be in South Africa and he's to be taken to a safe house until a team can get to him and ""extract"" information from him.The safe house is operated by a fairly new agent named Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). It's his first assignment with the CIA and he wants to impress, to move forward. He gets his chance when the information team arrives closely followed by the hit squad that was chasing Frost to begin with. They take out the team but before they can take Frost, Weston escapes with him only to be tracked down. They eventually escape but you know this assassination team will eventually find them.Calling in, Weston is told that he needs to move forward to another location and pick up the means necessary to get Frost to another safe house in South Africa. After picking up the package with various items he needs at lockers in a crowded soccer stadium, Frost causes a scene claiming he's been kidnapped. The security believes him and ignores Weston's pleas only to have Frost kill his guards and escape. Weston follows suit and continues his chase of Frost.But there's more going on here than a simple chase film. The movie is also about what caused Frost to become who he is today and watches as Weston alters from a totally innocent and naive agent into something much more deadly. The fact that Frost has a background in psychological warfare makes the viewer wonder is he just trying to mess with Weston's head or is he trying to help he get a view of the bigger picture? The answer to that question isn't offered until near the end of the film.Another question that runs through the film is the fact that somewhere in the CIA there is a traitor. How is it that the assassination team knew where the safe house was? How have they been able to track down Frost as he moves from place to place? And who gave them the information that led them to him at the beginning of the film? As viewers we wonder about these questions. As a participant, Weston must try and find the answers to these questions as well, never knowing who is an ally or foe.The film moves at a frantic pace with tons of car chases, gun fights and hand to hand combat sequences. Unlike the spy films of the past, people actually get shot, stabbed and bleed. There is a touch more realism here than spy films past. But that goes hand in hand with the story of undeserved loyalty and questions of deciphering who exactly the bad guy is.Washington has never been better. There are subtle plays at work here he delivers that make you wonder if Frost is good, bad or indifferent. The answer is found by the end of the film. Reynolds does an equally great job portraying an innocence in his character that gets jaded as the film progresses. How he ends up, what he will become is also answered by the end of the film.Most films like these today are compared less with Bond and more with Jason Bourne. This film is grittier than the Bourne films and much more so than the Bond series. It will hold your attention and have you guessing from start to finish as to what is actually on the microchip that Frost has possession of. It delivers the goods from start to finish an is well worth taking the time to sit back, watch and enjoy.",N/A

1316431,"I am by no means a hardcore Anime fan but I enjoy and appreciate the art of the animation medium. I had seen the original EVANGELION TV series on DVD back in the late `90s and enjoyed the series. When I saw this remake and it's second part (2.2 You Can (Not) Advance), I was blown away by the quality of direction, story and technical achievement. This is a fresh, complicated, original and highly moving storyline that bears multiple viewings and maybe even some research online to really drill down and understand the complexities of the story's characters and actions.I was also very impressed with the marriage of traditional and digital animation by this director and crew of artists. I've seen a lot in the world of animation storyboarding and direction over the decades but this film had me re-winding to see some amazing action sequences again and again. This is a film series that many artists learning the trade today should study.I cannot possibly top the well written and detailed reviews of others here in describing plot or other important details of this film series production. Just wanted to toss in my two-cents and recommend this volume and it's follow up, 2.2, to fans of the genre or students of animation in general.EVANGELION is not for children nor those who have no tolerance for the sci-fi or Anime genres in general. But judging by how my daughter reacted to seeing it for the first time, this series should please a great many teens and young adults looking for more depth and complexity in their characters than just young heroes who venture off in giant robots to defend humanity from strange creatures",N/A

1341811,"Even though this film, and the book, have a predictable ending and plot development, I still like its allegorical message which is very optimistic, romantic, and brave. In my humble opinion, I see the world of the film as not so much a dystopic view of some possible future, but as a candid portrait and satire of our current post-capitalist dystopia. It helped me to realize that we currently live in a totalitarian, feudal, aristocratic, religious global society and culture, where the rich and powerful sacrifice the young in order to keep the lower classes in line. Think Iraq, Afganistan, Iran, .. Keep everyone afraid, hungry, oppressed, and ignorant/ stupid by hypnotizing them with hyperreal media.The ultra mediatized Spectacle society portrayed so beautifully in the movie, with the exaggerated super fashion bizarro look of the residents of the Capitol, reminded me so much of Guy Debord's revealing and incisive look at the Society of the Spectacle done in the 1960's, and still equally valid today in 2012. Panem is the American Empire, but where is our Katniss?Another observation on the metaphor and trope, I noticed that like many other post-apocalyptic films, after the great conflagration, it is always a reactionary, conservative, totalitarian regime that takes over the running of the world-as if the apocalypse always leads to regression and a return to a feudal society. A good example is ""The Handmaids Tale"" by Margaret Atwood, and the film based upon her book.Excellent movie and book, see the film and read the book(s).

274784,"Concept and story are okay though no more than okay.  Casting is fairly poor for most actors.  Acting is mediocre as is direction.  Special effects were fine for the day.  Sound is not great.  A number of minor unnecessary irritations.  The whole US-USSR thing is in the way rather than helping anything.  Meant to heighten tension I suppose.  Very poorly done.  Spacewalks are clumsy and non-sense in how they are done.  When aboard the Discovery for the first time, they open a spacesuit and breathe the air to test for oxygen.  Ridiculous when they obviously would have the means to test the air.  That was widely available even back when the movie was made.  The future time of the film with many apparent advances portrayed would not have done things this way.  Just oodles of these things all through the movie.Then when the US-USSR declare war, order the US part of the team to Jupiter to leave the Russian ship and vice versa, well that gets beyond stupid.  Would such orders get issued?  Probably.  Would people in that situation around orbit or Jupiter and a mysterious monolith go along rather than staying together?  I don't think so.  And adding that to the movie really adds nothing.  Again, I don't mind these spoilers.  They are saving you from the putrid movie this is.  Then of course they do actually work together, as this in between was just a clumsy attempt to create drama and of course extend the movie which lacks any real content.I won't even list all the other little things meant to add humanity that instead just fall flat.

1393051,"While the artistic merits of this film can't be ignored or denied, the rest of it is truly a waste. I wanted to shut it off after about 20 minutes, and I have a very high annoyance tolerance for films. Visually, it is stunning but combined with a non-linear story-line, an odd plot and wasted acting, The Tree of Life is simply a bore. You can't even really summarize this film properly. During the 50's three sons are seen growing up in a typical home with a somewhat strict (but not bad) father and now, in present day, the eldest reflects on his sad past. Why is he so angry and resentful? Who knows, because the mere glimpses we get are not nearly enough to establish anything. Sean Penn plays the modern day son and I'm pretty sure he doesn't utter a single word in the entire movie except a random whisper to the viewers. In fact, I read recently that while he was on set, he had no idea what he was even doing there because he apparently didn't know what the point of his role was... Brad Pitt plays the 'stern' father back in the past (and does a marvelous job actually) but again, his character is never fully fleshed out so we only get a surface picture of him. Jessica Chastain is the mother, who wanders the film aimlessly, loving her boys and husband, but never speaking a word of importance. She does love washing her feet alot though...... There's also alot of whispering in the movie.The one redeaming factor is the beautifully haunting score. I didn't realize until the credits that Alexandre Desplat conducted this. He is my new favorite composer after hearing his work in other recent films. It really is a glorious and noticable score and I only wish the actual film could keep up with it. At well over 2 hours, it was hard not to fidget and constantly check the time. The ending was just....odd. But by that point I was so past caring I didn't even try to break it apart frame by frame like I usually like to do. This is not a fantasy(or is it??) but it does contain dinosaurs. Like I said; odd. I was told beforehand you will either love it or hate it and I think I know which end I am leaning on.",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

1338299,"First, some background information.  Batman has had four Robins over the years.  The first Robin, Dick Grayson, leaves Batman and later changes his crime-fighting name to Nightwing (with a new costume).  The second Robin was Jason Todd, who, well, you'll learn all about him from the movie (or from the other reviews.  Hey, just because all the other guys have spoilers doesn't mean I have to.)  Also, the Joker has had some slightly different origin stories over the years.  In some of the versions, he began his career as ""Red Hood,""  wearing a red metallic helmet which completely covers his face.  He was wearing this hood when he fell into the chemical vat which changed his skin and hair color, so Batman never knew who he really was.The film begins with the Joker clobbering the Jason Todd Robin with a crowbar.  You don't actually see the crowbar hit Robin's head, nevertheless, this is a good reason for the movie to be rated PG-13, and you probably wouldn't want your younger kids to watch it.  Then a bomb goes off, and, um, we're in the present day of the film (many years later).  There's a new villain in town calling himself the Red Hood.  The major crime boss in Gotham is the Black Mask, and the Red Hood wants to take over his territory, apparently.  But that's not what's really going on...I'm not a Batman expert, and I haven't read the original comics the movie was based on, but this story seems self-contained and you don't really need any more background information than what I gave you above for the story to make sense.  The animation is pretty good (better in some places than in others, as is typical).  Regarding the voice actors, I think John Dimaggio does a great job as the Joker.  He steals every scene he's in (plus he gets most of the best lines).  Jensen Ackles does a good job as Red Hood.  Bruce Greenwood is adequate as Batman, and Neil Patrick Harris adds humor to Nightwing.  (I get this vibe that Batman wishes Nightwing would just go away, which makes their scenes together amusing.)I have two problems with the movie that keeps it from being a five star.  First, the Black Mask character just isn't very interesting.  Second, and more important, **slight spoiler** when Red Hood asks Batman The Big Philosophical Question towards the end of the movie, Batman's answer just doesn't quite work.  **end spoiler**For special features, there are trailers for Superman/Batman Apocalypse, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Batman: Gotham Knight, Superman: Doomsday, The Lord of the Rings (Animated), the Jonah Hex motion comic, and Legend of the Guardians.",Batman: Under the Red Hood

I took it for what it was; a low budget horror flick that is just for fun. Jay Reso (wwe superstar Christian) was good, though I wish he'd be in it longer. Horror movies that deal with inmates escaping from a creepy asylum is always good for a few shocks and one of my favorite storylines for scary movies. So, if you want to watch something not too deep and just want to veg out and have fun with a movie, I recommend this flick. It's not going to win any awards, but it's definitely watchable.

The lead character played the father in an understated but powerful way and the son somehow pulled off the tough guy act despite looking like such a sweet kid.

1586804,"After the success of Director Sergio Corbucci's classic 'DJANGO'- 1966 starring Franco Nero, many sequels in name only of the character sprouted like weeds on the public and only two had anything to do with the original character.  Here we have a perfect example of that in which the main actors in both films are just named Django without the machine gun in coffin.  The archivists at Timeless Media Group have released an incredible double feature for an unbelievable price that even people who hate westerns might want to purchase.  What is wonderful is that they are in their original aspect ratios and transferred from the original negatives so that you can really appreciate them on your high def monitors.  First up is Director Eduardo Mulargia's 'A MAN CALLED DJANGO' aka 'W DJANGO' aka 'VIVA DJANGO' aka 'LO CHIAMAVANO DJANGO'- 1971 and starring Anthony Steffen in one of his best roles .  This film was released a while back by a company called Dagored Films.  I have already scribed a review of that release so any one interested in the plot, please seek it out among my reviews.  I will, however, comment on the vast improvement of the transfer.  Dagored released it in a 1.85 ratio with faded color and annoying scratches and splices appearing in the negative.  This version is in its correct 2.35 ratio encompassing the full beauty of Cinematographer Marcello Masciocchi's images and compared to the other, it's a revelation and gives the film the honor it deserves.  Another success was Director Gianfranco Parolini's  'SARTANA'-1968 starring Gianni Garko which spawned sequels also and why not have both characters show up to the party in the same movie. Next up is one of them, a Western with many outrageous titles  to its credit 'DJANGO AND SARTANA'S SHOWDOWN IN THE WEST' aka DJANGO AND SARTANA ARE COMING...IT'S THE END' aka 'FINAL CONFLICT...DJANGO AGAINST SARTANA' aka 'SARTANA, IF YOUR LEFT ARM OFFENDS, CUT IT OFF' and finally 'ARRIVANO DJANGO E SARTANA...E LA FINE' -1970 directed by Mr. Eccentricity himself, Demofilo Fidani who is billed as Dick Spitfire for this release and is also known as Miles Deem to all Spaghetti Western fans.  The film has many incredible names linked to it: Hunt Powers in the Django role; Chet Davis as Sartana, the awesome Gordon Mitchell as Black Burt who kidnaps beautiful Simone Blondell for a ransom and cameos by Krista Nell and the great Ettore Manni.  The Photography is by future Director  Aristide Massaccesi aka Joe D'Amato who constantly throws incredible images at your eyes and a unique score by Coriolano Gori.  The film consists of the sparring dynamic duo teaming up to rescue the girl and eventually revealing why they both were interested in the affair.  The film is consistently entertaining and is presented in its original 1.85 ratio looking like it was made yesterday.  Both films have their original trailers and poster galleries as the only extras but who can quibble? I highly recommend that every Spaghetti fan scoff this and its companion volume up because Timeless Media Group was responsible for one of the best Spaghetti Western box sets called what else? 'THE BEST OF THE SPAGHETTI WESTERNS' released last year consisting of 20 films on 10 DVD's in their original aspect ratios and which is now out of print and commanding high prices ( I think you can purchase it from their website but don't quote me on that). These two volumes may go the same route and become limited editions.  It's obvious that these films were released on the DVD market because of Director Quentin Tarantino's new reboot of the genre 'DJANGO UNCHAINED' but who cares when you can get them in these pristine transfers.  Kudos to Timeless Media for these wonderful releases at such incredibly low prices.  May they continue releasing more of them in the future and now I am on to the next volume which probably will blow me away just like Django and Sartana's explosive gunplay.",Django!: (A Man Called Django! / Django and Sartana's Showdown in the West)

There is also a 3D movie clip which might have been used to train  soldiers in the proper use of certain weapons. Later, the Allies began using 3D imagery for aerial reconnaissance.  One of the historians in this documentary is impressed with these WWII, 3D photos & the 3D movie stating that the 3D images help him pick out details that he normally would overlook.  3D wasn't entirely new at that time. Stereoscopic technology has been around  since 1838. I was impressed with the 97 year old Frenchman who has been taking 3D photos for 80 years. Although, Hitler decreed that photography was unlawful, this Frenchman would take photos whenever he was able.

1179412,"Every time an opera is produced outside of a ""traditional"" staging, a stink is raised, a fuss is thrown. a fit is hissied.  Arguments (both sensible and non) about the inappropriateness of the ""concept"" arise, as does the inevitable discussion about the death of tradition and the end of the civilized world as we know it.  Every once in a while art needs to shake us up out of a stupor.I adore this score (and the Met's old Merrill/O'Hearn production) and found myself resisting this new one, but finally giving in during  the Prayer and Dream Pantomime.  I loathed the first image of the ""forest"" - and the fishheaded matre d'  creeped me out.  Then, I shook my head and smiled . . .  and fell under its genuinely magical spell.  By the end of the dream  pantomime, I was in tears, moved as deeply as though I'd watched silk-winged angels descending from heaven to tuck the children into 1000 thread count damask linens.  This was a vision as imagined by the children, and like a child's dream filled with whimsy, and fueled by beauty and terror and an unexpected poignancy - the very definition of sensational.By deglazing the sugar content - albeit with a little vodka and pills - a production like this reinforces what a marvelous work of musical theatre Humperdinck's opera truly is.  Removing the veil and seeing it in a glaring and controversial light we can ascertain and focus on its glorious and intricately woven musical fabric (and yes, even with that unwieldy English text).Maestro Jurowski was having a marvelous night with the pit band delivering a ravishing reading of the score.Another reason this H&G; worked for me was its very contrast with the O'Hearn production, making me want to revisit the opera - in an old-fashioned, ""traditional"" production, the kind I had grown to used to, but perhaps just a tad complacent with.  Sometimes, a dark, wild ride is whats needed, allowing one to come quietly back to rediscover the love still there.  I'm grateful the Met took a risk and mounted this marvelous production.",Humperdinck: Hansel and Gretel

1553797,"If you are looking for the best quality video of the 1960s band, the Kinks, performing at the height of their career, and are just a casual fan, this DVD is probably not the first one you'll want. But, if you are a Kinks ""completist"" - you probably haven't seen this performance before and might want to check it out. I found it fun to watch, more for the shots (and there are many) of the audience of fans, jumping and screaming (though the crowd noise does not overpower the vocals as on many early Beatles performances.But here is some additional info you should know going in:1) This 1965 performance was probably filmed for French Television (though there are no ""credits"" and location of the venue is not given). The introduction by an announcer is in French (which I don't speak). The camera angles are strange as most shots are from either the back of the theater or the back of the stage. There are quite a few close-ups of Ray Davies but his hair is in front of his face on many shots. And the sound appears a bit out of synch when you see these close-ups.2) The DVD is short - just 20 minutes - with eight songs (indexed by chapter), including their hits (""All Day And all of The Night"", ""You Really Got Me"") and a cover of ""Louie Louie"".3) The sound is acceptable - not hi-fi by any means - and the both the sound and the black and white images are what you usually find in newsreel footage of the era.So, I'm giving it three stars - (Amazon's rating for ""It's OK) - for general entertainment value.

Tell me anything on display here is any more silly or unbelievable than the massive power of the Galactic Empire being taken down by some teddy bears with sharpened sticks.""Battle Beyond The Stars"" was Roger Corman's space opera during a time when Star Wars' box-office success inspired many studios to churn out similar movies.  This was also his highest budget film, made at a hilariously still paltry $2 million.I have mixed feelings on Corman's films, as they tend to be a mixed lot.  Some are honestly pretty great little movies, others just a tremendous waste of time.  But when they're good they're great fun and ""Battle Beyond The Stars"" does not disappoint.The plot is cribbed from ""The Seven Samurai"" though movies both before (Magnificent Seven) and after (A Bugs Life) borrow similarily.  The evil Sador (the Emperor/Darth Vader-type) tells the peace loving planet Akir that they can submit to him or he'll kill them all, inspiring Shad (the young farmboy Skywalker-type) to go and find some merceneries so his planet can at least put up a fight.  He does, and they do.  That's basically it.What makes it work is the script, which doesn't take itself too seriously and is pretty witty without ever going so far as to turn the whole thing into a farce, and the sheer creativity on display, with plenty cool robots, aliens and ships to look at.  Amazingly, the $2 million budget stretched enough to make it all work.  Sure, some of it looks a bit low rent, but none of it distractingly so.So while I was expecting something cheesey to laugh at, like ""StarCrash"" (awesome movie, check it out) what I got was a surprisingly good, fun little flick.Sure, there are some plotholes, some of its a bit goofy, and you'll see some bad acting and some unconvincing special effects.  That said, you get those same problems in the new Star Wars trilogy, but those were made with unlimited resources and have no excuse for being that way.  ""Battle Beyond The Stars"" has every excuse for being exactly what it is, and what it is is a lot of fun.",Battle Beyond the Stars

1604401,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Imagine that your grandmother has just passed away and your family is cleaning out her apartment. Amidst all the stuff your grandmother has collected, you find a tantalizing and shocking newspaper article involving your grandparents that you never heard about before from any other family member including your mother. This is essentially the set-up for 'The Flat', a fascinating new documentary by Israeli filmmaker Arnon Goldfinger.Goldfinger's grandparents, Gerda and Kurt Tuchler, were German Jews who emigrated to Palestine (now Israel) in 1936 after the Nazis forced them out. The article was from a virulent Nazi newspaper, Der Angriff, from 1934, which chronicles a trip made by a high Nazi official, Leopold von Mildenstein, to Palestine. The article features photos of Mildenstein traveling to Palestine with Goldfinger's grandparents.The mystery is not only why this SS man would go to Palestine with two Jews but why Goldfinger's grandparents would accompany him. Furthermore, Goldfinger discovers that his grandparents visited Mildenstein in Germany AFTER World War II numerous times and kept up a friendship with him and his wife.The documentary brings out the fact that in 1934 the Nazi policy of 'The Final Solution' (i.e. the extermination of the Jewish people) had not been developed and there was some consideration of deporting German Jews to Palestine. Mildenstein apparently was on a scouting mission to see if deportation was a feasible solution to the ""Jewish Question"". Mildenstein actually headed the SS Office of Jewish Affairs prior to it being taken over by the infamous Adolph Eichmann. Clips from Eichmann's 1961 trial in Israel are shown along with transcripts from the trial indicating that Eichmann considered Mildenstein as an ""expert"" on Jewish affairs and that he was basically his mentor! Nonetheless, Mildenstein, apparently was not a racialist and privately had no problems socializing with Jewish people. The Tuchlers may not have been aware of Mildenstein's Nazi affiliations and were simply glad a non-Jewish German would strike up a friendship with them.After Mildenstein's replacement at the Office of Jewish Affairs in 1937, his movements in Germany up until the end of the war were largely unknown. Goldfinger flies to Germany and meets up with Mildenstein's daughter, Edda, who firmly believed that her father was no longer affiliated with the Nazis during the war. Goldfinger seeks out a retired journalist who wrote about Mildenstein during the 1960s when he had become an executive for Coca-Cola. Although the former SS officer was mentioned during the Eichmann trial, his reputation wasn't tarnished as it was believed (as the retired reporter pointed out), that his affiliation with the Nazis had ended in 1937, when he was replaced by Eichmann. During the war (as Mildenstein's daughter's husband indicates) Mildenstein was believed to be a mere 'journalist'.The plot thickens when Goldfinger finds Mildenstein's wartime file in records located in the former East Germany, which were not available to journalists back in the 60s. Goldfinger discovers that Mildenstein was actually promoted as an official in Goebbal's propaganda ministry and worked there for the rest of the war. Goldfinger confronts Mildenstein's daughter with the new information about her father and she appears reluctant to believe what Goldfinger is telling her. Even after she shows her a copy of her father's resume indicating his Nazi affiliations during the war, it is obvious that she's now quite uncomfortable dealing with these new revelations.As for Goldfinger's grandparents, he interviews an expert on German Jewish history who points out that the Tuchlers obviously were not aware of Mildenstein's Nazi wartime activities. They were also willing to forgive him for any past Nazi associations, due to their past friendship with him. Despite being Jewish, the Tuchlers never learned Hebrew while in Israel and continued to speak German. They continued to identify with German culture in spite of the Holocaust and that's why they visited Germany many times after the war.For the most part, 'The Flat' is riveting--only the ending proves to be slightly awkward. As Goldfinger and his mother walk through an old German Jewish cemetery in Germany, they search for the grave of his great-grandfather. Goldfinger unnecessarily berates his mother for not taking more of an interest in her parents when they were alive in order to find out more about their history. Apparently, his grandparents were as complicit as the mother in not revealing information about their time living in Germany and their association with Mildenstein. The mother concedes she should have taken more of an interest in the family history but when she was younger, we have to believe her that she simply had no interest at that time.'The Flat' brings to the fore more revelations regarding issues of guilt and responsibility of ordinary Germans vis-&agrave;-vis the Holocaust. By the same token, it chronicles conflicting feelings on the part of those German Jews who survived. 'The Flat' plays out like a detective mystery, with its talented creator cast in the role of high stakes super sleuth!",The Flat

1125861,"Director Ang Lee has really outdone himself this time. I'm not sure just what his main intent is exactly with the plot and storyline he's working with here, and that's because it's so layered. It's mostly a spy story on its face, but it also deals with human interaction and just how powerful is our human desire for connection on various levels.The costuming, set design, lighting, cinematography, set dressing... all are so rich and textured that I found myself feeling as though I was lost in a piece of art instead of watching a movie. This is a film you could watch three times over a fairly short period and you'd come away with different wonderful impressions each time.There is not a single weak performance among the actors and actresses and the Special Features on the DVD bear this out.

1533863,"Have you ever looked at someone and, in an instant, felt a powerful connection to them? Something that made you want to abandon your life and run away with them? Not me, but the same can't be said for two teens at the center of the latest comedy from the mind of Wes Anderson.It's 1965 and, on a small, picturesque island in New England, there are two very unhappy children. One of them, Sam Shakusky (played by Jared Gilman), is an orphan visiting Camp Ivanhoe with his troop of wilderness-oriented Khaki Scouts. The other, Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura (played by veteran actors Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and three younger brothers. Walt and Laura (Murray and McDormand) are both attorneys who are struggling to maintain both their personal and their professional relationship. One year before the beginning of our story, Sam and Suzy meet backstage during a play which Sam is attending and Suzy is acting in. Despite the brevity of that encounter, the two find themselves inexorably drawn to each other and exchange letters during their separation. They vow to run away together the next summer. We fast-forward to '65 and Sam has vanished from Camp Ivanhoe and done it without alerting his scout master, Randy Ward (played by Edward Norton) or any of his fellow scouts. The search is well underway before the Sheriff, Captain Sharp (played by Bruce Willis) is made aware of the fact that Suzy has vanished as well. When the young lovers meet again, Sam has brought a multitude of camping necessities while Suzy brought books, her cat, records and a record player. They hike and camp for days until finding a deserted cove and make camp, naming their new home Moonrise Kingdom.Obviously, there is more to the story. There's the revelation that two of the adult characters are involved in a clandestine relationship of their own, additional details of Sam's life story are revealed, and his eventual confrontation with his former scout troop who see it as their responsibility to bring Sam back using any means necessary, including lethal. All this culminates in a scene that had me on the edge of my seat. More than likely, this film, like some of director Wes Anderson's previous efforts, will fail to resonate with the viewing public.

288862,"While I appreciate the merits of the 1939 original of ""The Women,"" not a camp follower. It seems to me that if a story has the interest of this one, there's room for updated versions (not reinventions).  There are some successful remakes out there; best to remain open.  That being said, unfortunately the 2008 remake was ridiculous.  It ran more like ""The Group"" and was quite offensive.  They seemed to think degeneracy would bring it up to date.As promising as this subject film was, it doesn't survive either as a remake or as a film.  Its promise comes with basically same script, good cast, overall effective casting and the addition of color.  It's demise comes in the execution, mostly with uneven flow, lack of timing with flat and ineffective dialog - the basics of a relational film. For one example, the scene with Kay and Crystal in the dressing room could have come from a high school play reading.  Where was the director to say ""cut"" and sitting the two down and explaining what is needed here, like, this time with feeeeling.  However, this is an experienced director as are the actresses. Maybe some higher ups in the production are the ones responsible (by being irresponsible). The whole movie comes across like a radio that's off station, not quite into the static, but off enough to be irritating.  Yes, there are good segments (most critical and consumer reviewers commend Dolores Gray), but the overall disconnects in essentials are ruinous. It's a shame, and I really wanted to like it.Was there a lot of tension or conflict on the set?  There was definitely a spoiler in the execution of this. Something choked it off and, again, it's a shame.  Maybe they tried too hard, overloading it with too many features and just couldn't keep all the plates up at the same time.  That's a circus, not a movie.  Perhaps the extras such as the musical numbers, fashion focus and the like drew off resources that should have been spent on what is essential to a film like this - the portrayals. That would explain the uneven flow, lack of timing, rushed quality and false notes in much of the dialog.  The source material is all about relationships.  It was said of the producer/director of a successful epic that he didn't let the spectacle override or get in the way of the human drama.  He was a stronger hand than whoever called the shots here.  If you can handle that with a massive production, it should be possible to handle it with a picture like this.  Whoever is responsible, they loaded it up with extras, not bad in themselves, but flat couldn't pull it off, and it's too darn bad.It turns out that the enthusiasts of ""The Women"" (1939) are vindicated in their dire predictions about attempting remakes.  With the subject film, it's not so much that it's a failed remake; it's that it's a failed movie.  At least they changed the title.",N/A

342182,"If you love authentic Victorian mansions complete with ghosts this is your movie.I was riveted to the screen drooling over the Victorian furnishings, detail upon intricate detail of tassels, drapes, statues, wide plank floors, carved doors, arches,wrought iron spiral staircases, carved mantelpieces, brass beds, all so sumptuous and spooky.I feel that the movie makers also adored this period of interior design. To me the movie seemed to revolve around the house and it's interiors.  It was the HOUSE that was the star and the actors were simply minor supporting cast.With the abundance of overwrought furnishings, how could it not be haunted?The lead character, an old maid who longed for a home of her own, had a love/hate relationship with the house, knowing it had a life of it's own and wanted her there.Throughout the movie she refered to the house as if it were a person in her audible thoughts which the audience could hear.  She would say things like ""It's me it wants.  It won't let me go.  I will stay here forever.  It knows where I am. It's watching me.""Indeed, this type of majestic home of this period is imbued with a strong personality of it's own and I love how this movie acknowledged that.  There were loud pounding noises at night in the house, but I didn't find it scarey, just fascinating.  The lead character was so mousey and pathetic, and the house in contrast so grand and over the top, that it stole the show.If you have ever been inside an authentic fully decorated Victorian mansion you will understand the movie and what inspired it.  You get a sense of grandeur, mystery, history, deaths, family, bygone days, and a feeling that the house itself is alive.  Finally, a spooky movie that I can totally identify with and appreciate for the amazing mood a Victorian mansion can create.

Like some others I am not a Woody Allen fan but I did enjoy the movie.  I thought it was a light, fluffy trifle.  Out of the gate the main set-up of Gil's (a demure Owen Wilson) romantic notions of writing a great novel being met by his fiancee's (the ever-lovely Rachel McAdams, here playing the fascist ""I-know-what's-best-for-you"" girlfriend tripe) dismissiveness feels utterly familiar; this mismatch was written as about as loudly on the walls so to speak as a neon Nordstrom's sign blares against the dark nighttime.  So what made this movie click then?  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet but I'll just say that there is a little magic afoot which brings Gil's romantic writer into contact with various literary and artistic historical figures such as Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Dali; the offbeat spirit and portrayal of these characters is a minor delight, perhaps moreso to those viewers who are much more intimately acquainted with them.  The filmography of Paris is gorgeous (and sanitized), a loving ode to the city of light.  And no characters are drawn out to be utterly repulsive (though some of their behavior would be in reality, all is neatly forgiven or waxed over in almost sitcom fashion) so no real sour taste is left in your mouth (or memory).

595791,"Harold Prince's original Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" must be ranked as one of the greatest Broadway musicals ever. This DVD, recorded during a live production in 1982, is as close to experiencing that original production as future audiences will ever come. Angela Lansbury told Robert Osborne in a TCM interview that ""Sweeney Todd"" would be her legacy, because it was the only one of her great Broadway performances that was recorded for posterity. I wouldn't go that far--we have ""Gaslight,"" ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" after all, not to mention how many hundreds of episodes of ""Murder, She Wrote""--but her performance as Mrs. Lovett is nothing short of magnificent, and this DVD preserves it magnificently.The entire cast--with one possible exception--matches Lansbury. Two other cast members from the 1979 production also recreate their roles--Edmund Lyndeck (Judge Turpin) and Ken Jennings (Toby Ragg). It's too bad Len Cariou and Victor Garber couldn't recreate their roles as Sweeney Todd and Anthony Hope. But George Hearn is enthralling as Todd, with a splendid baritone voice, and Cris Groenendaal as Anthony has a tenor voice as pure and sweet as anyone could wish. I have a problem, however, with Sara Woods as Johanna, though it may be more a problem with the music she's given: Sondheim pitches Johanna's big number, ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird,"" so high that most of the time Woods is almost shrieking.Still, when Lansbury and Hearn caper about the stage, brandishing razors and singing ""A Little Priest""--as brilliant as anything by Gilbert and Sullivan, but in a far darker vein of humor--you know that you are watching geniuses at work. Tim Burton's version of ""Sweeney Todd"" is superb if you want to see a movie adaptation of this musical.

1432133,"This film was so thoroughly murdered by the critics, that I was not expecting much - but to my great surprise I spend a very pleasant cinema moment!As you probably already know the main plot is about two former crusaders, a noble knight Behmen (Nicholas Cage) and a simple warrior Felson (Ron Pearlman), who, after running in trouble with the Church, are pardoned but asked to perform one more service - escort an alleged witch, a young girl named Anna (Claire Foy) to the remote abbey where she can be tried. The journey begins in what seems to be western Austria and is quite long and dangerous as the travelers must cross the Alps and some particularly wild forests to reach the abbey of Severac which seems to be somewhere in northern Switzerland or southern Alsace.The reason for this journey is that the whole country is stricken by an incredibly deadly epidemic - in fact it is the beginning of THE Black Death of 1348-52, which was going ultimately to kill half of the population of the whole Europe! The Cardinal d'Ambroise (Christopher Lee) who sends the two ex-crusaders in this mission is himself dying of plague. The Church considers Anna responsible for the epidemic, as she was seen around most of the places where the disease began - she also is supernaturally strong and speaks often in tongues nobody have ever heard off. The Church hopes that the monks of Severac, who own a large collection of secret books advising how to remove curses and expel demons, will be able to deprive the witch of her power and put an end to the plague, which is every day killing hundreds of people.Behmen and Felson will not go alone - they are joined by a young Inquisitor, Father Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore), a local knight Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen) who lost his wife and children to the plague and a swindler and thief, Hagamar (Stephen Graham) who knows well the way to Severac and for this reason is pardoned and send on the quest. The group will be joined later by a young altar boy Kay (Robert Sheehan), who, being of noble birth prefers to become a warrior rather than to be a seminarist. Once the group is complete, the quest can begin...There are many reasons why I liked this movie and one of them is that it really reminded me of some good moments I spend playing Dungeons and Dragons! The group of adventurers seems coming straight from an ADD adventure - there is a Paladin (Behmen), three Warriors (Felson, Eckhart and kay), one Priest (Debelzaq) and one Thief (Hagamar). The whole quest combines a good mixture of wilderness, city and underground (dungeon) adventures and there is a good deal of hazards, riddles, black magic and even some monsters... And the whole thing is very professionally mixed, with some nasty surprises and not silly at all!Nicholas Cage is a very good actor (he however sometimes plays in very bad movies) and he did very well in this one. Stephen Campbell Moore is also very convincing as Inquisitor Father Debelzaq, but the best performances were those of Ron Pearlman, Claire Foy and the young Robert Sheehan. The atmosphere in places like a plague stricken medieval burg, the high Alps, the dark Wormwood Forest and finally the dungeons of Severac was very well made! One of the things that I liked the most was the appearance of people in the towns - although the streets were muddy and dirty and people wore practical sturdy and not very colorful clothes (the best clothes being reserved for Sunday or other special days), they did not have dirty faces and they did not look retarded or sick (except of course those who were stricken by the Black Death). I really do not know why so many directors consider that every person in a medieval town must have a dirty face and/or a look like he/she was issued from ten generations of consanguinity! Dominic Sena escaped this trap with grace and the result is quite credible.Another thing that I liked was the approach of the Church and especially the character of the priest Debelzaq. In a lesser movie the political correctness would ask that he be the main scoundrel and the real villain - in this movie things are much much much more complicated and the final solution of the movie is a very unexpected one. For sure, the horror of witches hunt is not blunted in this movie (although in real history the real epidemic of witch hunt took place AFTER the Middle Age was over, in XVI and XVII century!) and there is one scene of execution of an innocent young woman which is absolutely horrible - but the other face of the Church is also shown in this movie, by the devotion of Cardinal d'Abroise and also many others priests and monks who try to o their duty in the time of unprecedented cataclysm without any regard for their own safety and until their last breath.Last but not least - the ending of the movie is quite good - I was moved by it and I really did not expect it happen, when going to see it. Which is even more surprising, my wife was moved by it too - and she is not anywhere as forgiving (or as much into fantastic adventures) as I am...Now of course it is only a movie without much more ambition than to distract, so one should not try to see too much in it and it is certain that in this film Christianity itself is shown as a kind of more organized witchcraft, which is ludicrous as Jesus himself strictly forbid to play with magic as a blasphemy against the first commandment and warned that any people who claim having some kind of ""powers"" are just charlatans. The scene in which a Catholic priest performs a kind of weird ritual to make certain that a hanged and drowned witch will not raise from the dead is perfectly ridicule and a horrible blasphemy! Any Inquisitor playing this kind of esoteric nonsense would find himself in serious risk of prosecution for heresy!Also, be advised that most of the the battles mentioned in the beginning of the movie are pure invention! There never was a siege of Tripoli in 1334, there never was a ""battle of Imbros"" in 1337, there never was a ""battle of Artah"" in 1339. On another hand, the siege and capture of Smyrne in 1344 by troops raised by the Pope Clement VI is authentic - although this army was not made of sensu stricto crusaders. In fact the real Crusades ended in 1291, long time before the Black Death (1348-1352), with the last crusader fortress, Saint-Jean d'Acre, taken by the Muslims. The director and the author of the scenario needed however two former crusaders for this movie in time of the Black Death, so they bended a little bit the history - but considering the final result I am tempted to give them the absolution...)))To conclude, I advise you not to believe the critics (or the reviewers for that matter) and give this movie a fair trial. If you find it wanting, you can hang it, drown it or even burn it at stake, and that most probably with the benediction of the Church... ))) But if you like fantastic adventures, you could really find it quite entertaining - I certainly did!",N/A
677341,"Every other year or so I watch this marvellous look at the Lincoln Presidency, the Civil War (or War Between the States, depending how you look at it) and Lincoln's relationship with his complex, difficult wife.Many people have commented on the almost uncanny similarties & events between Lincoln's Presidency with that of the Kennedy era. One such connection is that Mary Lincoln set out to create a higher standard of elegance for the rather shabby White House at that time. Although she characteristically went way over budget, most commentators praised her good taste. Apparently prior wives were more inhibited by the mores of the time to effect any domestic changes in the Presidencial abode. As an aside note, Mary Todd Lincoln was the first wife to be called ""First Lady."" Jackie Kennedy's elegance & style not only won over masses of Americans, she impressed & wowed much of the world. I remember that when the Kennedy's went on a State tour of South America, many people on the street held up placards with the slogan ""JACKIE SI, JACK NO!""Unfortunately Mary Todd Lincoln was much less fortunate. The documentary clearly indicates that she probably suffered from a dysfunctional combo of Manic-Depression & Obsesskive Compulsive disorder. When her favorite son Willie died, she brought mediums into the White house in a sad attempt to reestablish some sort of communication with him (so-called ""psychics"" have much to answer for then--and now.) Where Jackie O. was adulated, Mary Todd was almost universally vivilified. The Press saw a vulnerable target & went for it.However, in one segment of the documentary we discover that Mary Lincoln formed a close relationship with a ""freed slave"" woman--who just happened to have worked for Confederate First Lady Mrs. Jefferson Davis. This woman had also lost a son & Mary Lincoln identified with & trusted her. In was through this relationship of kindred souls that Mary became involved with the abolitionist movement much more intimately than her husband ever did. African-American commentators in the film elaborate on this & many other pivotal points.In regards to Lincoln himself, A HOUSE DIVIDED masterfully presents the figure of a man with enormous depth of character & concern. Although a principled abolitionist, Lincoln may not may not have been the total intergrationist one would hope, but his moral stand was sincere & the best that could be hoped for in the milieu in which he lived. He was a man of integrity, forced by fate to participate in a horrendous war that was pulling a new nation apart. The cause of the North was just, but that didn't erase the bloody consequences of the cause. A soulful man, the conequences of the war were devastating on Lincoiln. Some said that he almost resembled a corpse. Nonetheless, his ungainly appearance was trumped by a principled moral conviction far above his race or time. In my estimation, Abraham Lincoln was the greatest American President...ever.",N/A

We saw that The Note III came out and were eager to see how the lives of those we got so caught up in were unfolding. Sadly, we were disappointed with the plot of this movie. The magic that the other 2 films had were not in this one. I would have given it 2.5 stars if I could have. It just fell short in a lot of ways and we personally weren't fans of how things played out in this film. I couldn't recommend the first two installments more....just leave off there and don't go down this road.",N/A
320423,"Charlie Chaplin was the master of physical situation comedy back then, because talkies (films with dialogue and speech) hasn't quite taken off yet, so activity was the theme of the comedy. Charlie Chaplin's repetitious twitch from tightening two screws over and over from the production line in the factory was just priceless.But, what really made this film important for me to own was having the beautiful Paulette Goddard as the Gamin (what does that mean anyway?).  Even without words, her presence on film came off strong and dominating.  Without her, this film would definitely show signs of something more missing because she added platonic romance and excitement to the film as Charlie Chaplin provided the comedy.And this film definitely reflects a future beyond the initial year this film was made.  Perhaps not to us, (the current film viewer), but to the audiences of 1936, this film may appear to have been about 50 years ahead of it's time.  I wonder if anyone else caught that.Anyway, I saw this film on cable TV about 30 years ago, and so I do remember that I thought that it was way ahead of it's time for being filmed in 1936.  I never bothered to consider that the film may be worthy to own on VHS back then, but when I saw that the Criterion Collection has allowed this film to grace its large unique collection on Blu-ray, I knew that I would want to have it now.Yes, with Paulette Goddard with her greasy hair, and dirty black dress, and her beautiful eyes and her lovely smile, I cherish this movie all the more.  This is definitely a keeper on Blu-Ray.",N/A

1495677,"""Sledge Hammer"" is one of those great, lost TV shows with a wonderful cult following. A show that was so inspired, so ahead of it's time, so great, that it was bound to struggle in the ratings and have a short life on television. It's truly one of the great ""Cut before their time"" shows. Thankfully, the show's rabid fans and cult base have never given up on the show, and it was released on DVD a few years ago. Now, you get this one stop shopping collection right here with the entire 2 seasons and 41 episodes all in one package.Premiering in 1986, ""Sledge Hammer"" was a half hour cop show that was obviously a spoof on Dirty Harry. It starred Inspector Sledge Hammer (David rasche), a hard boiled San Francisco cop who loves violence, his gun, getting the chance to shoot or blow up something, and is quite insensitive, rude, and sexist. Oddly enough, he is very llikeable. Go figure. In the premiere episode, he is partnered up with Dori Doreau (Anne-Marie Martin). The series followed the two from one crime to the other, with their captain, Capt. Trunk (Harrison Page) trying to hold his temper and blood pressure from the always dangerous, clueless, and destruction causing Hammer.Featuring a kick butt theme song by Danny Elfman, this collection is a laugh riot from start to finish. There is a lot of fun in watching Rasche brilliantly bring the gun loving, mayhem causing Hammer to life. You can tell he relishes the role and delivers it all straight, which makes it all the funnier. The premiere episode is titled ""Under The Gun"", although on the disc it's listed as just ""Sledge Hammer!"". The debut episode sets it up nicely. We instantly get a sense of who Sledge is, and is quickly partnered with Doreau. In a nod to 'Dirty Harry', the episode features John Vernon as the Mayor, a role he played in the Clint Eastwood classic. This episode deals with Sledge having to rescue the Mayor's kidnapped daughter. I don't need to go into every episode, but other season 1 highlights include ""Witless"", which is a spoof on the Harrison Ford film 'Witness', where Sledge takes refuge at an Amish settlement. ""Dori Day Afternoon"" is an obvious take off on the Al Pacino film 'Dog Day Afternoon' where Hammer and Doreau are trapped inside a bank with a couple of robbers. Sledge is followed by a news crew in ""Hammer Gets Nailed"", and investigates a slate of Elvis impersonator murders in ""All Shook Up"". Producer/Creator Alan Spencer ended season one pretty abruptly with ""The Spa Who Loved Me, thinking it would not be renewed. It was, and the finality of that episode was explained away in a typical TV cliche in the season 2 premiere, ""A Clockwork Hammer"". Season 2 is just as good, but I will leave it to you to either discover or re-discover the episodes.Unfortunatley, this collection does not bring over the extras from the previous releases. No commentaries, no featurettes. That's a big disappointment, but the hysterical brilliance of the show is more than enough to make up for it.In the end, ""Sledge Hammer"" was a hilarious show that was really too awesome for it's own good. I guess it was just not what the audience could warm up to at the time it originally aired. It's a shame. It is nothing but a huge, gigantic smile from start to finish. Hilariously acted, written, and just a blast. Still, we have the show on DVD, and that is cause for a huge celebration.",Sledge Hammer! The Complete Series

1539649,"Remember when horror movies were fun? Back in the 1980's, all you needed was a masked killer, some somewhat attractive teens (saying ""hot"" may be a bit of an overstatement), and a couple of buckets of blood. Mix these ingredients in the cinematic slasher blender and out came a slasher flick worthy to show your friends. Today's horror world is a different place. In the world of found footage horror, cheap just is never cheap enough. Why pay for a couple of gallons of blood when a door can slam shut several times for a ""scary"" effect? Yawn. This is not the horror that I grew up with and it is certainly not the horror that I am proud of today. Am I the only one who misses the classic era of slashers in which the filmmakers just wanted the audience to have a good time? Clearly, judging by tonight's film, I am not. From directors Michael Hoffman Jr and Aaron T. Wells comes the delightfully entertaining ""Girls Gone Dead."" If ever there was a cinematic valentine to the 80's slasher, it is this film.""Girls Gone Dead"" starts off a little rough as we meet our main girl (A.K.A. the ""pure"" one) Rebecca (Katie Peterson who reminds me of a prettier and more talented Tara Reid) having a nightmare involving a sacrifice in a church. The girl who is to be sacrificed is not pure and must be killed to rid the world of evil. Thankfully, Rebecca wakes up from this nightmare to be confronted by her mother who is terrified that her weekend vacation with ""the girls"" will turn into an orgy of sin (shades of ""Carrie"" & ""Slumber Party Massacre II"" here). Of course her mother is right and Rebecca and the girls plan to drink as much as possible, get naked, and find some guys. What Rebecca and pals don't know is someone has come along for the ride slashing each and every one of the girls, and the guys they meet along the way, until all the ""evil"" has been cleansed from the world.This is the kind of film that many will either love or hate. The acting is a bit all over the map with many of the girls hired more for their ability to take over their tops than deliver their lines. The film is far too long at 102 minutes and it takes to take its sweet time getting to its final reveal. Also, speaking of final reveals, this has to be one of the most predictable whodunit slashers that I have seen in recent memory. If you don't figure out the killer from the second this character walks on screen, you haven't seen enough horror movies.So, what works about this film? Everything else! We get some ooey gooey slasher deaths with more blood on screen than all of the Saw sequels combined. This killer is brutal. We are talking multiple decapitations, a cut off breast, multiple amputations, and that's just in the first half of the movie! Thankfully most of the effects are practical so there is no obvious CGI to put a wet blanket on the gore. Though the CGI does rear its ugly head in the final death scene and the result is...not terrible, I guess.Need more reasons to watch this slasher? How about cameos that include Jerry ""The King"" Lawler as a sheriff,  Beetlejuice & Stockbroker Sal from ""The Howard Stern Show"", Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain, porn legend Ron Jeremy, and, in my favorite cameo, the ""Queen of the B's"" Linnea Quigley as bartender Wild Willie. A blast from beginning to end, this is the kind of movie that just puts a smile on my face. Whether you rent it from the breasts, the blood, or maybe a combo of the two, you are sure to have a great time with ""Girls Gone Dead."" Have fun with it, it looks like everyone who made it did!",Girls Gone Dead

It would have been better had they made up a religious symbol that had no connection with any modern day religions cause Ridley Scott demonstrated just how bad things have become these days -- Even Frank Herbert of Dune did better at building the religious mythos around the pre-existing ideology -- oh yeah, he was a novelist and not a holywood type movie maker who are used to producing top billed B-MoviesI rate this movie in the mid-B range.As to those seeking to buy, save your money and wait for wal-mart to include it in their $5 misc movie box.",N/A

I had high expectations for this and I wasn't disappointed.It seems fitting that their first film was a silent picture, as they have now moved into the realm of early talkies. The picture is still shot in glorious black and white and the creatures are the sort Ray Harryhausen would have been proud of. The entire film is a labor of love and it shows in every scene. A good portion of the film is a rather faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's story, but a twist comes and manages to fill out the entire film with new material. As a purest, I was afraid how this would go, but my fears were unfounded.

K. premiere, expressed a fair amount of disappointment in the liberties taken by Abi Morgan (The Hours, which coincidentally was also much more acclaimed on its U.S. debut than it had been in Britain). Having read the source material many years ago, I think this is an earnest adaptation. I don't get too caught up with the similarities and the divergences, however, the work must stand independently as a film. The harshest criticisms that I have read seem a bit unwarranted, but the glowing accolades miss the mark as well. This well-meaning and gorgeously produced film experiences some of the same problems that many adaptations of a literary success have faced. It's hard to bring the subtle nuance and introspection of fine prose to the screen without it seeming a tad disconnected.Eddie Redmayne plays the title character (this casting upset some, but Redmayne is quite good even if not the perfect ""book"" Stephen of your imagination). His story is told between two juxtaposed stories: one supposedly recounting the love story of his life, one his days in the trenches during the Great War. As he remembers his idyllic true love, however, it seems a little less successful than I would have liked. A pre-war Redmayne meets a lovely French woman (Clemence Poesy) when he is working with her husband. After a few chaste exchanges, suddenly they are deeply in love with no regard for her circumstances. The only cue that this is a grand romance is Redmayne's moony expression when no one is looking but the screenplay never builds much romance or even friendship between the two. It's occasional sex, I never felt this was a grand love story that would affect them in any substantial way. For the story's sake, though, we must believe it. The wartime sequences are more rewarding, as Redmayne stares down death and turns from an aloof outsider to heroic leader.My principle reservations, I suppose, stem from the piece's screenplay more than anything. The early scenes faced uneven pacing and are simply chock full of meaningful looks with little dialogue. Poesy, in particular, is a real cipher who never gets fully fleshed out as a real person. But that's it in a nutshell. Redmayne is so front and center, we don't really get to know anyone else beyond surface presentation. His squad in the wartime segment are appealing, but largely unexplored as well. ""Birdsong"" had the potential to be an absolutely devastating tear-jerker. I wanted it at ANY time to profoundly move me. The subject matter should have and could have. But I was so detached from everyone in the cast, I ended up admiring this production more than loving it. And I really wanted to love it. Maybe that's why the detractors to this adaptation were so harsh, it keeps you at a distance throughout. Still, there is enough good to make this a recommendation for the right audience. About 3 1/2 stars, for me. KGHarris, 4/12.",N/A

1548083,"I'm a fan of the Shrek franchised and enjoyed last year's DVD release of SCARED SHREKLESS. I thought SHREK'S THRILLING TALES might be more of the same. SHREK'S THRILLING TALES includes three cartoon shorts and one of them doesn't even involve anyone from the Shrek universe. The three shorts are:""Night of the Living Carrots"" - This short doesn't feature anyone from the Shrek universe, but instead features the cast of MONSTERS VS. ALIENS. After the heroics in ""Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space"" the Monsters find themselves fighting off a horde of zombie carrots grown from the blood of the now defeated Mutant Pumpkins. The carrots turn anyone and anything they bite into a mindless zombie. B.O.B. is immune to their attacks and has to save the world.""The Pig Who Cried Werewolf"" - This short features the Three Little Pigs and the Wolf. The Three Little Pigs return home after a night at the movies to discover they have a new next door neighbor. The Pig Who Built the Brick House is in a wheel chair with a broken leg and starts spying on their new neighbor. He's sure the neighbor is up to no good and tries to warn his brothers, but they don't believe him.""The Ghost of Lord Farquaad"" - As Shrek and Fiona are preparing to leave on their honeymoon, Fiona is kidnapped and Shrek and Donkey race to save her. They are led to a cemetery and discover that the ghost of Farquaad is behind the plot. He couldn't be a king in life, so he plans to rule the underworld with Fiona at his side as his queen. While he prepares to throw Fiona over a waterfall, he sends a giant stone dragon to kill Shrek and Donkey. This ogre and his faithful steed never seem to get a break.I enjoyed ""The Pig Who Cried Werewolf"" and even though it's not part of the Shrek universe, I liked ""Night of the Living Carrots,"" too. However, I've already seen THE GHOST OF LORD FARQUAAD before. It was originally a ride at Universal entitled SHREK 4-D and was later released on DVD as SHREK 3-D. Now it's been re-released here as filler. I wish there was another new Shrek short that was included, but there's not. It's rather disappointing as all of the shorts on SCARED SHREKLESS were entertaining. There are just so many great stories that could be told in a short format. Dreamworks should be pumping them out, but they aren't.There really aren't any extra features on the DVD except for the usual trailers and the promos for several other animated Dreamworks projects (MASTERMIND, HOW TO TRAIN A DRAGON, etc.).Overall, though ""The Pig Who Cried Wolf"" and ""Night of the Living Carrots"" are a blast, SHREK'S THRILLING TALES is a let down because over half of the disc is a re-release of SHREK 3-D, but under a different name.",N/A

665097,"Although not released until the late 1970s, this video was filmed in 1974, approximately a year or two afterBorn to Swing: Movie About the Alumni of the Count [VHS] was shot.The film may seem unstructured and meandering (and it is), the true value is we are witnessing an oral history from the lips of key players and creators of the Kansas City jazz sub genre. ""Jazz"" is probably a misnomer because most of the music coming from Kansas City during that era was based on twelve bar blues. Indeed, every musician who migrated from Kansas City and made an indelible mark on jazz as a whole were as much blues musicians as they were jazz musicians.While this is an oral history, it also contains performances. Actually, this reminds me of Jelly Roll Morton'sThe Complete Library of Congress Recordings, except there is no character to fill Alan Lomax's role as interviewer, and we are experiencing video instead of sound recordings. Perhaps that is stretching it, but the net effect is this film does provide a glimpse into the musicianship as well as the characters of the musicians. And among them are some key keaders, including Jay McShann, Basie, and others. I cited McShann and Basie because they both can be traced directly back to the beginning, which arguably started in Oklahoma City with Walter Page's Blue Devils, and parallel groundwork in Kansas City by Bennie Moten. Indeed, Moten seems to be a key and of all of the Kansas City leaders probably the only one who was actually a Kansas City native!I especially loved the performance portions because they included Night Train by its composer - Jimmy Forrest - and clips showing drummers Ernie Williams, Papa Jo Jones and Baby Lovett in action. Jo Jones was (and remains to this day) one of the most influential drummers in jazz history. He single-handedly developed the vocabularies for brush and hi-playing. However, the highlight for me was seeing Baby Lovett. The reasons are that I have many hours of Jo Jones clips, but this is the first I ever saw of Lovett, and Jo Jones had mentioned him in an album about drum styles.Suffice to say, this is important to music historians in the same way that any recording - audio or video - of pioneering musicians are to understanding the persons and their music through firsthand observation. The video is not a scientifically conducted oral history, but it still remains a part of the oral record and only time will tell just how important it is. In the meantime, it is available to enjoy and study casually.",N/A

915609,"I wonder if there is even one film actress who has not been offered the role of a prostitute.  Critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel once mused the reason so many movies include call girl characters is that is the only kind of woman the men who run Hollywood know.Of course, in movies prostitution almost always seems to be a transaction between consenting adults.  As with the smash PRETTY WOMAN, the Dan Aykroyd farce DOCTOR DETROIT makes being a call girl appear as likely a career choice as accounting or teaching.  I don't hear any female high school graduates saying, ""I'm gonna be a hooker - I really wanted to be a tax accountant but that requires college and I want to start earning now!""A 1983 comedy, DOCTOR DETROIT presents an innocuous college professor who gets mixed up in an organized crime power struggle involving prostitution and other illegal activity.  Thanks to a capable cast including Aykroyd, Fran Drescher,  T.K. Carter, Howard Hesseman, Andrew Duggan, and George Furth, the action is once in a while humorous, with uninteresting parts that at least never go on to the point where you give up on the film.Some of DOCTOR DETROIT's best moments belong to Lydia Lei, who, according to the INTERNATIONAL MOVIES DATABASE web site, was about halfway through a decade-long movie & television acting career when she made this title.  Lei's an energetic presence in her portrayal of Jasmine, one of the call girls who helps Aykroyd get in and out of his fine mess.  It is unfortunate her talents may not have been used this well elsewhere.  (I saw Lydia Lei in one other movie, the bomb thriller VICE SQUAD, where she again plays a girl for hire.)What DOCTOR DETROIT needs most is a more engaging villain.  Actress Kate Murtagh does her best as mob boss Mom but except for menacing people and having her goons chase around Aykroyd every so often, she does not get to do enough to make you root against her.DOCTOR DETROIT's funny at times but disappointing at too many other times.",Doctor Detroit

1522162,"One of the great signature stamps of movies over the last 50 years has been the opening sequences of the James Bond films.  This newest version is no exception and certainly must rank as one of the best.Bond (Daniel Craig) is on the trail of a mysterious evil-doer who has managed to obtain a computer drive that contains the names of deep cover agents who have infiltrated various terrorist organizations.  Bond is shot by mistake by Eve (Naomie Harris), an agent working with him and is believed to have been killed falling into a fast moving river.Now certainly at the 20 minute mark we know Bond isn't actually dead.  After a few months of pounding down booze on some unknown island he learns that his boss ""M"" (Judi Dench) is under scrutiny for losing the agent names.  Bond resurfaces and manages to track down the culprit in southern China.Bond films have another common component throughout the years.  The villain.  They are always rich.  They are always powerful.  And they always want more.  As one of the best bad guys in memory, Oscar winner Javier Bardem plays Silva, a one-time MI6 agent and computer genius.  He doesn't necessarily want more money and power, he wants revenge.  He's after ""M"" who he feels betrayed him years earlier.Directed by another Oscar winner, Sam Mendes, ""Skyfall"" focuses on the actors.  Terrific performances are coaxed out of Craig, Bardem and especially Dench, another Oscar winner.  Mendes also manages to blend in many older Bond staples, not the least of which is 007's pristine Aston Martin DB:5, with some new; including updated versions of old characters (Q and Ms. Moneypenny) along with another surprise.While the heart of this film is in the story and the emotion rarely seen in the franchise, ""Skyfall"" is not short on what makes it Bond.  There are glorious visuals, especially in Shanghai, a cool gadget or two (but no exploding pen), hot girls and a memorable final act.  While I have a fondness for all the Bond films and all the actors who played 007, this one may be at the top of the heap.BLU RAY UPDATE (3-17-13):  This was my favorite movie of 2012, so watching it again on Blu ray was high on my list of things to do.  If anything, I'm more impressed.  Not having to worry about plot details, I was able to focus on the production values, soundtrack, editing and yes the quality of the transfer.  All of which equal my appreciation for the film.Here, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed to have been killed, but resurfaces when he sees his boss ""M"" (Judi Dench) under political pressure for allowing a list of embedded NATO agents to be acquired by the bad guys.  Both Bond and ""M"" are tired and seem unlikely to continue.  But they do.  Director Sam Mendes (who also contributes one of the 2 commentary tracks) masterfully integrates a change for future Bond films including new characters who blend in nicely with the past.One of the things I noticed is the great photography in this film which sparkles in this 1080p transfer.  The colors are off the chart.  The blacks are black.  Check out the gorgeous shot of Shanghai at night, dense with colorful lighting against the black sky.  When the story moves to Scotland, the palette changes to greens, blues and browns as the topography changes.  From what I can tell, this transfer does not include any IMAX images shown in some theaters.Like the video, the audio track is exemplary.  Using the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, a properly set up room bristles with activity including a marvelous opening sequence.  As opposed to every other Bond film, the conclusion of the scene results in Bond and MI6's failure to get the bad guy(s).  As the Oscar winning song by Adele plays over the credits, we yearn for the next event.  The surrounds are active with waterfalls, crashing glass, helicopters, gunfire and explosions throughout the film.  The dialog is always crystal clear throughout.Extras include a second commentary track by the current generation of Broccoli producers and production designer Dennis Gassner, a 59 minute ""Shooting Bond"" documentary, a short set of ""Skyfall"" premier interviews, a trailer, a soundtrack promo and a slew of other film trailers.",Skyfall

916406,"Once in awhile, I come across a little-known movie that is, in my opinion, a ""must-see."" Duma is such a movie.Set in South Africa in the present day, 12-year-old Xan and his father nearly run over a baby cheetah while driving home on an empty stretch of highway one evening. They take the animal back to their South African farm and raise it as a pet. Xan mentions that when you give something a name, it then becomes your friend.  After trying to decide on a name, Xan finally decides to give his new pet the name of Duma, which is ""cheetah"" in Swahili. It isn't long before a wonderful friendship begins between Xan and Duma.One of the things I enjoyed most about this movie is the portrayal of Xan's closeknit family. Xan's dad, Peter, is sure to teach his son all he knows about building things and taking care of a farm (which comes in handy later in the movie). Peter spends a considerable amount of time with Xan and, together, they test Duma's speed by racing alongside the animal with a stopwatch.  There is also a strong love and devotion between Xan's parents, even when they are in the midst of tragedy.Duma is void of anything objectionable; however, there are several intense scenes that will frighten younger viewers. When Xan embarks on an adventurous journey and a promise he made to his father to return Duma to the wilds where he belongs, Xan encounters the harsh elements, wild animals, a stranger, and near death due to a lack of water and food. Parents will also want to discuss Xan's choice to leave on his own to help Duma find his way back to the wilds, rather than solicit his mom's help.Duma is one of those movies that I hadn't heard much about, but that I am glad I purchased. Themes of family unity, forgiveness, loyalty, loving your neighbor, and grief all play integral roles in this movie. I highly recommend it for everyone ages 12 and over.Duma has been added and reviewed on my Mom-Approved Movie Listing on my Wordpress blog.",Duma
1213740,"had there been any balance in this film, i could have spared a few more stars.  as it is, this is nothing more than tim alexander's big chance to share with us his distaste for black women.  pitting a truly good man against a crazy woman for this kind of documentary was a very bad idea.  actually, there was something objectionable about the personalities of most of the characters portrayed by actresses.  the guys, on the other hand, all come off looking like beaten down, beleaguered ""good men"" who've been done wrong by their shrewish lovers.  almost none of the men who appeared in this film had anything good to say about black women.i noticed that whenever a woman said things that didn't mesh with the interviewer's opinion, he was quick to ask, his voice oozing judgement, ""do YOU have a man?""  a woman who doesn't have a man isn't necessarily without one because she nags or puts men down.  we're supposedly in the wrong if we stay with a man who isn't right for us or denigrated if we refuse to get involved with a man who doesn't meet our needs or to whom we're not attracted.  we're either too picky or not picky enough.  and there's certainly something wrong with a woman who helps her man out when he's in need but ends up getting screwed because he sees her as weak and a patsy.  whatever choice a black woman makes, it will be seen by someone else as a bad choice.this documentary doesn't hold men and women to the same standards.  women are criticized for having children with more than one man, but i don't recall hearing the same criticism of a man who has randomly sprinkled his seed from one end of the country to the other and has more kids than he can count, let alone support.  furthermore, if so many children are being raised in single-parent (mother only) homes, which is pinpointed again and again as one cause of the ""angry black woman syndrome"", it could be because the men know they don't have to stay if they don't want to.it was mentioned several times that tonya's friends should not have been involved in her relationship with james.  these women were not always in favor of the way she handled her marriage, but the negative aspects of their opinions always took center stage.  still, it was because of their friendship that one woman narrowly escaped being beaten to a pulp by her man.  sometimes a woman's girlfriends are her only link to sanity and her only source of strength.  this isn't to say that such involvement is always right, but it certainly isn't always wrong.i was intrigued by mr alexander's definition of ""strong black woman"", a term i have come to hate for my own reasons.  to him, it means, ""i can give you grief and you can't shut me up and i'm gonna wear you down until you just wanna hit me"".  is this a clue to the character traits of the women with whom he's been involved?  if so, he should consider this:  black women were, several times, accused of making bad choices and ""attracting"" the wrong kind of man, which can only be translated to mean that if her man's a jerk it's her fault.  but the male interviewees who made these claims were not all chosen by their women.  most of them scoped those women out and got what they wanted based on what was important to them at the time, usually looks, status, financial gain or sex.  maybe mr alexander needs to take note of that and be more discriminating in his own choices.  as a result, he might be a better filmmaker.the editing process for this documentary probably eliminated lots of intelligent input from black women, and even black men, who have a healthier understanding of why we are the way we are.  maybe mr alexander will put those together for a different story when he calms down.(clarification:  the two stars are not for the documentary;  i'd have given no stars if amazon allowed it.  they're for that magnificent work of art, jimmy jean-louis.  he's worth five stars all. by. himself.  my, my, my.)",Diary of a Tired Black Man

Cimarron unable to settle down in life to a quiet existence, goes from one adventure after another, leaving wife and son for the thrill.

1472781,"This has to be one of my favorite summers for movies in years. There has been such an amazing variety and now we have a Rock-N-Roll Musical amongst the superheroes, aliens and action stars.""Rock of Ages"" is an adaption of a Broadway rock comedy musical that debuted as on off-Broadway production in 2008 but made its debut in Los Angeles 2005. Constantine Maroulis of American Idol fame played the lead character, Drew Boley, in the Broadway production and has a cameo role in the film. Diego Boneta takes on that role in the film. He is probably one of the lesser known of the cast that includes Julianne Hough, Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Mary J. Blige, Catherine Zeta Jones, Malin Ackerman and Tom Cruise as legendary rock god Stacee Jaxx, a role without question inspired by Guns-N-Roses front man Axel Rose.The movie and the play are set back in the late 80's when Rock-N-Roll was decadent and king. Dennis Dupree (Baldwin), owns the rock club The Bourbon Room that I can only assume is based on the real rock club The Whiskey in Los Angeles. Sherrie Christian (Hough) is an Oklahoma girl who takes the bus to Los Angeles to pursue her Hollywood dreams. Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) is a legendary rock star who is lost in a sea of scotch, decadence and his own persona. Drew Boley (Boneta) is a bartender who is a rising star. All of these characters come together to form the story.There is nothing unique about the storyline to the film. All of the stories that mold together are pretty clich&eacute; and predictable. The romances that form and the dilemma's faced and dealt with have been seen and done before. Yet, the truth is, the movie isn't about the stories that are formed during the course of the movie by the actors. The movie is a love affair with a Rock-N-Roll age that ruled in the late 80's and has since been forgotten in an age of boy bands, studio-enhanced albums and conformity.""Rock of Ages"" is a homage to the decadence and freedom of Rock-N-Roll. Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) embodies all of the things that defined a generation of rock stars and also make complete fun of it. The movie is fun, hilarious and had a guy like me, who graduated high school the very year that this movie takes place in, grinning throughout, remembering all of it and inside my head, singing along with all the unforgettable songs.""Rock of Ages"" is similar in style to the television show ""Glee"", but with all of the seediness and debauchery of an age of music that got lost in the shuffle somewhere.",N/A
1532453,"Just as the first one, this one is even more action packed and well done. If anything, too much foreshadowing of an event before it happens instead of at the end like the first movie. Still excellent and worth every penny. I've watched both movies three times already and would be happy to watch again. Everyone in the movie plays their parts well and especially Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, Noomi Rapace (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Original Swedish Version & better than the recent remake of TGWTDT)and especially Jared Harris(Mad Men & many other fine roles)Harris is an amazing actor. I see where some people complain because it really isn't strict to Holmes original time frame or character or something silly like that but these are fun, well made, intriguing, funny, action packed, well detailed movies with amazing top drawer actors and produced excellent. I for one have no complaints and thoroughly enjoy them to the max. Somewhat like James Bond movies, can't wait for the next one and Downey Jr and Law make perfect Holmes & Watson. They interact and play off each other beyond belief. OK, I think i'll go watch them again while I wait for the third one to be made.......Spider K Blues",N/A

131909,"Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy in this film?  It's hard to tell at first.  Dickie (Jude Law) is the wild child in the first half, while Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) seems like a nerd.  It's at half-time that Dickie calls Tom &#34;boring&#34; and drops off screen, and we're left with the impression that the movie is going to drag through the 2nd half.  But it's not true -- the 2nd half of the movie is the real thriller, and it flies by.  We ought to know better - most of us have followed Matt Damon through Bourne after Bourne and never got bored.  I wasn't too thrilled with the ending though - would have liked something a little more cheery.  It sets Ripley up for his coming career, in films such as Ripley's Game (starring John Malkovich) in which he's completely polished up his fiendish act.

38678,"Clint Eastwood's 1997 movie ""Absolute Power"" has a rather novel premise, in which the bad guy is the President of the United States, the good guy is an elusive master thief, and the Secret Service and police get caught in-between.  A strong cast, including Gene Hackman, E.G. Marshall, Ed Harris, Scott Glen, Dennis Haysbert, and Laura Linney, carries the movie.As the story opens, master thief Luther Whitney (Eastwood) inadvertantly witnesses the shooting death by the Secret Service of a politically-connected young woman, after her tryst with a sadistic president (Hackman) goes badly.  Whitney escapes, to be targeted by the Secret Service.  The leading DC detective on the case (Harris) and Prosecutor (Linney) develop their doubts about the ""official"" version of the crime, only to discover the Secret Secret is dogging their footsteps with a different agenda.  Linney's prosecutor finds her situation compromised by her status as Luther's estranged daughter.  Luther Whitney will have to find a way to stay alive and free long enough to implicate the real killer, while minimizing the collateral damage.""Absolute Power"" creates its suspense through a clever if rather implausible plot and nuanced performances by the cast.  Ed Harris is superb as the detective trying to find a killer, while Gene Hackman is convincing as a cynical and bombastic politician dodging disaster.

The film is laugh-out-loud funny, but probably also scarily not too far from the truth. The dialogue is gloriously obscene: DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE if you are offended by language (I doubt there is a single line of Peter Capaldi's manic dialogue that isn't laced with truly inventive scatology). James Gandolfini, as the US Army lieutenant general who happens to be a dove, may be the only recognizable face, but the entire ensemble is brilliantly cast, and it is probably Peter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker whom you will most likely remember.

260191,"""Small Sacrifices"" is a haunting depiction of the life of Diane Downes, a woman convicted of the brutal attempted murder of her three children.  One child, Shawna, was killed, and Karen and Robbie were emotionally and physically maimed by a ruthless sociopath whose obsession with a married man resulted in unspeakable evil.  This movie was riveting from start to finish.  Staying extremely close to the case study by crime writer Anne Rule, the film is truly unforgettable.  I was particularly struck by the courage exemplified by Diane's little girl, Karen, who, though at first unable to speak because of fear, is ultimately able to tell the truth despite the horrific trauma in her life.  We as viewers see that good ultimately triumphs when the prosecutor and his wife take steps to ensure that Robbie and Karen will have a loving home.The acting in this miniseries is unsurpassed.  Farrah Fawcett is mesmerizing as Diane, bringing to life a chillingly childlike psychotic personality.  Her little-girl persona is horrifying yet heartbreaking: a spoiled individual determined to get what she wants despite the cost.  The other actors turn in stellar performances, particularly the man portraying the prosecutor and the little girl who portrays Karen.Please give this wonderful and unforgettable film a chance.

The film is relatively simple, but is beautifully photographed from the early scenes in a foggy train yard, to the sumptuous richness of colour in the overgrown cemetery, to the stark, dream-like beach scenes. The film is a tone poem about youth, love, exploration, nostalgia, superstition, madness, and death.

1468661,"My opinion of The Lorax stayed in flux as I watched the movie unravel.  Sometimes I cringed at how heavy-handed they were with Dr. Seuss' simple message, sometimes I was just dismayed by the overabundance of nasty characters they invented and imposed upon his story.  Too many times I wondered where Dr. Seuss was in this messy adaptation of his book.  He seemed to be missing.  The reason for this became clear in the bonus feature.  Apparently, the filmmakers felt it necessary to attach things not Seuss to the story because it was somehow deficient as it was; requiring their extensions.  One of them even had the gall to call it a homage.  But tampering is tampering; clearly they were dissatisfied with most things in the book, especially the notion of having to adapt Seuss' two-dimensional drawings into......two-dimensional drawings in motion.  A lot of work was required to ""make them come alive.""  Again, a slur against Dr. Seuss' work.  If they didn't like the book, why bring it to the screen?  Why add dopey songs that were less than memorable and subvert the plot?  Why ignore the language, what makes Seuss' work so distinctive?  There was a reason Dr. Seuss kept his book somber from page one to the end.  His point was concise, not easily forgotten.  But they had to turn everything into a carnival atmosphere complete with slapstick, a romance, a city, and another villain that wasn't even required.  When you overhaul someone else's work to this degree you're not honoring their work, you're desecrating it.",N/A
1441957,"Superb movie. I will leave it at that. The acting could not have been better nor the storyline better told. A tremendous story shot amongst some of the most spectactular scenery one could ever imagine. IF New Zealand weren't such a liberal hell hole I would love to live there just to sit on the porch and look. It is probably against the law to sit outside in New Zealand however as the government there probably takes the view that the public display of the evil old human being is bad for the environment. Good thing this movie was set before the New Zealander Government went completely mad though.Unusual to see the New Zealander home guard still using the Martini Henri rifle during the period so displayed. I would have thought that the Enfield would have been in use by then...probably my mistake and I am aware that the Martini rifle did remain in partial use until well into the early part of the 20th Century...don't know why I even thought about that much less mentioned it.Back to the point. This is a must see movie for the entire family. Informative for both those ignorant of the Boer War and for those unfamiliar with the Maori People of New Zealand. Good movie for the entire family and truly a ""must see"".",Tracker

1063043,"I've enjoyed Irwin Allen - and disaster flicks - since I first sawThe Towering Inferno (Special Edition). That's one of my top ten movies of all time, and I'd put it up against any action or disaster movie filmed today. Real fire beats CGI fire any day, no questions asked.I got Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea in a multi-pack with The Lost World. That movie was kind of weird. But then, Allen had to start somewhere. By the time he got to Poseidon Adventure and Towering Inferno in the 70's, his movie-making was perfected. I will argue with anyone who says the effects in those two movies are out-dated or not as good as today's.Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is somewhere in between. In The Towering Inferno, Allen could use real fire and get amazing effects. But when you want to film under the sea, and you can't cheat and use a computer, what can you do? Well, he made a pretty good effort. The movie is good. The effects are enjoyable. There are times when of course it looks a little off. But it's 1961. Give them a break! For the most part, it's pretty exciting.The most criticism this movie gets is for its implausibility. While I really like science-fiction, I don't have much of a scientific brain, so I didn't mind so much. Personally I think the biggest flaw is that, with all that extreme heat, they all would not be sweating... they would be dropping over! And yet, there they all were, wearing their long sleeves. I think they could have been a little more lax in their dress code!",N/A
1516525,"This is one movie I would like to recommend to anyone and in particular, I would like to suggest every Pastor/Youth Group Leader shows it at their very next meeting! Make that an open house and be sure parents sees it as well!A heartwarming story of people just like you and I, of hurting youth and bewildered parents who try very hard to do the right thing. It is sure to open discussion betwixt generations and communication is so important!I do no think much has to be said about John Ratzenberger's acting skills. His presence alone with its quiet demeanor and simple and honest faith guarantees any movie to be a winner. Dakota Daulby plays your average angry teenager in need of someone who cares and understand the anger factor behind the vandalism.The story in itself is nothing new. We see it around us everyday, perhaps even in our own family. But in 'The Woodcarver' the message is clear and sure to reach out no matter how estranged we feel from the ones we love: WWJD? With this simple question, 'Ernest' reaches out to the teenager who destroyed his beautiful carvings and even Matthew's parents. Amazing, the reactions to such thought!I found the part of the grieving widower to be played with exquisite taste! Love such as 'Ernest' describes is not found everyday. I shall credit the director for knowing when to apply just the right emotion  to the right scene!As to the beautiful house used as set for this movie, be sure to check out the special features! I am ready to move in!For my part, I have started to believe angels comes in many shapes (see What if?) and John Ratzenberger might well counsel youths in lieu of acting one day!A must see for any family and worth 5 stars!!I received this book free from PROPELLER as part of their blogger review program.

The only girl to escape thus far was Jo, who instead of following the rail road track into town, decides to veer off into the woods, finds the creepy house, and then chooses to look inside for her boyfiend!She encounters the ""killer"" who chases her outside by the barn, where she finds her boyfriend, Corey, safe and sound - but acting too calm, too ""ok"" with everything for my liking! He then, off camera, goes to fight the ""killer,"" whereupon seemingly loses and the ""killer"" (still unseen) comes to kill Jo - but doesn't, letting her survive. But she DOES get a look at him.Come the arrival of the police, they comb the area but there's no sign of the other three teens - dead or alive - but the camcorder that one of them uses throughout to record ghostly stuff is quickly studied. It's then that, given it's last entry, the deputy asks Jo what really happened ... and as the camera turns to her, the screen goes black and the words TO BE CONTINUED come up!This film was not good enough that it needed to be a two-parter, but was just about good enough to be a solid 3 out of 5 movie for entertainment value. The acting was cheesy at the start, but once you got to know the characters you accepted their level of acting and went along for the ride, so to speak.In closing, it was co-produced by Robert Englund and his wife so that might explain a few things!

53919,"It was really no surprise when ""The Sting"" won the Academy Award for best picture of 1973.  A great story with a wonderful twist ending and an unbeatable cast: Charles During, Ray Walton, Eileen Brennan, Harold Gould and headed by Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Robert Shaw.  Most of all we have a film that accurately reproduces the atmosphere of the times in which  it is set -- the Depression of the 1930s.This is certainly one of the great films to come out of Hollywood.Now we have this classic movie available in the Blu-ray format with great picture and sound.  Being an audiophile of many years, I tend to notice the improvements in the audio first.  Here, the title music has been remixed in stereo to provide a great improvement.  The piano introduces the original Joplin theme and then the small orchestra comes in with great presence and power.  The rhythmic nature of the music is notably enhanced by the power of the tuba, traditionally used in popular music of that time, although it is necessary to point out that ragtime music used exclusively in this film had long gone out of style by the 1930s.  No matter -- it works perfectly here. The film uses sound stage interiors and sets, and beautiful sets they are depicting the Chicago Loop  and buildings true to the time of the film and beautifully reproduced in Blu-ray clarity.  For the sake of the one or two people in the world who haven't seen this movie, I won't go into the finish.My favorite scene in this, and probably any other movie, is the conclusion of the poker game between Newman and Shaw on board the train to Chicago.  Shaw has managed to sneak in a stacked deck ultimately dealing himself four nines and Newman four treys.  He raises Newman's bet by $10,000 and, a little hesitant and slightly frowning, Newman sees the raise.  Smiling, Shaw lays down his nines certain that he has won.  Newman pauses for a second or two and then lays down his hand smiling and saying, ""Four Jacks.  You own me $10,000, pal.""  When I first saw this film in a theater, the audience was quiet for a few seconds until they realized what had happened.  Then they began to howl with laughter.  It's still the best played scene I've ever seen in a film.  The expression on Shaw's face as he looks down at Newman's cards is unforgettable.I doesn't matter how many times I've bought this movie in various formats, the Blu-ray is worth it --  I know I'll be watching it again.",N/A

Three times in a row to be exact,  and rewound to the most spellbinding authentic appearing and downright heart rending scenes too many times to count.After I invested my entire day with this BRILLIANT movie, I then went to Wikipedia to check on how it had done, etc. Well, folks, I was downright peeved. I still am! This movie did the WORST for a movie that cost what it did to produce. Are they NUTS whoever ""they"" are? I've had this on my wait list since I first learned of it - on the internet, by the way. Actually, via seeing a ""drop"" which is basically a 10 second commercial, on HULU likely, but I'm not sure. What I notice is this. I didn't see ANY other advertising for it - and wouldn't have located it had I not done my own searching for when it would be out.Now, with the movie industry making these massively costly boo boos for their box office, don't they get it? Don't they get the fact that most of us want to stay at home now and watch these newly released movies for MUCH less than going out to the theater and dropping a hundred bucks for all the concession nonsense as well as the cost of going? Look, film makers. We are in a real bad place here in the US financially, and yet these movies are still our outlet. Also, we who have a set income, have to limit our entertainment options - and there is much more now available via ROKU and the net. Heck, I haven't had cable for years since I found HULU. It rocks to have the option of watching what I want, when I want to watch it. Also, all the networks have gotten it apparently - because I can also watch CSI or whatever - and when I wish, via their website. Who, in the world, doesn't know this now? I don't know anyone.Back to BATTLESHIP! My point is simple. This movie is exceptional, as is another movie by the star, Taylor Kitsch who appears in this one - John Carter the movie. It didn't do well at all either - and I just happened on it. On Amazon, of course, and you should buy it too! You won't be sorry. So, all you who are making the mistake of paying any attention to other than what folks are sharing in this forum? Get over it and WATCH THIS MOVIE. BUY THIS MOVIE!

She was always a Big Fan of mine as soon as she was recognized for her unforgettable music. I remember how young she was when I first heard her sing, I was Amazed at her voice, and said ""She's Going Places-Big-time!"" Sure enough, she climbed to fame in no time. After her  passing, I watched this movie once again, listening to that Beautiful Voice. Whitney Houston sadly left this world, but her music will live on forever, including her song at the end of this movie. ""I Will Always Love You."" And the world will always love the music she left behind. Together, Kevin and Whitney made this movie highly entertaining, enjoyable, and thrilling. The characters helped to make the movie alive, along with the young boy who played her son. What was there not to like?

As soon as he gets his hands on a gun, Bishop finally snaps. It has a great setting, immersive dialogue and action between characters, and a great soundtrack. Tupac shows us that he wasn't just another rapper-turned-actor like most rappers nowadays; he was actually a very talented actor, and Juice shows it. The only thing I didn't like was the abrupt ending. I thought it was weak and could've been better.Overall, I highly recommend Juice.

Actually, BAIT isn't all that bad.  First of all, this isn't another of those scantily clad teeny-boppers vs. shark movies that have inundated our screens for years.  Setting the action in a post-tsunami flooded supermarket gives the film a certain freshness.  The 3D and CGI effects aren't state-of-the-art but adequately support the movie's atmosphere.  The stock of clich&eacute; characters, including the precious pom Bully, are still more interesting than a bevy of brainless beauties or steroid-laden hunks.

And probably my last, unless I hear that they overhaul the player. $3.99 is a little steep in the age of Netflix, but when you're in the mood for Harry Potter...

We stopped it, exited out and restarted, which helped a great deal. With about a half hour left, the movie froze up. We waited for 5 minutes or so and ended up having to re-start it again and find our place, wait for it to load. And then it would not allow us to use full screen! It just wouldn't!

66430,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.The first and only movie directed by Sir Alfred Hitchcock to depict graphic violence & nudity has an interesting plot (man wrongly suspected of murder, while the real criminal is the last person you'd expect), but fails to capitalise on the initial suspense we've come to expect from films like Shadow Of A Doubt, Rope, North By Northwest, Vertigo & Psycho. The depiction of graphic violence & nudity was unneccessary (implying it increases the suspense and ultimately detracts from the story; unless you're doing a documentary on the Holocaust or on African tribes or a movie about the Holocaust, then I think nudity is absolutely unneccessary, as is graphic violence). There is one good scene where the murderer goes into a room with his victim, then the door closes as the camera pans back all the way down the stairs and out into the street. And a hilarious scene where the inspector feigns to eat his wife's nasty dinner while telling her about the case. However, those are the only good scenes in the film.I DO NOT recommend this movie. Stick to Saboteur, Shadow Of A Doubt, Rope, Strangers On A Train, Rear Window, To Catch A Thief, Dial M For Murder, North By Northwest, Vertigo & Psycho for pure, unadulterated suspense.This film is rated R (a rape scene with nudity, mild-to-strong language and three scenes of non-sexual nudity).",N/A

In addition to the narrator, these people share in explaining the concepts3) Fantastic special effects which do justice to the events they are recreating4) Great explanations of complex conceptsReasons to consider Wonders of the Solar System:1) The location shots can be pretty interesting2) Brian Cox (assuming you like his style, delivery, etc)3) The series offers a bit more human personality then How the Universe Works4) Avoids going into great (sometimes boring) detail into the concepts (good for beginners)5) Features more real life images, as opposed to CGI models (which are fantastic when done in both series)If you're a fan of astronomy/science, then I'd recommend picking up both series as they work well together and do not overlap much. For example, HTUW goes into great detail regarding the Big Bang, while this is not touched on in Wonders of the Solar System (for obvious reasons).  Regardless of which one you get, be sure to take a look at Carl Sagan's earth-shattering series, ""Cosmos"".  The series is, even today, ahead of its time.",How the Universe Works

1514255,"I really didn't know what to expect from this movie as I had never heard of it previous to renting it.  I am a big fan of the zombie genre, but pretty picky about zombie movies.  This is a slow moving, majestic movie with glorious and sweeping landscapes.  The zombie story is there, the survival tale is there, but the sheer beauty of the land and the story of an unlikely friendship caught my imagination.  This is not a slash and gash zombie movie, it is a moving tale of survival and hope.",N/A
1570576,"CONCEPT: There's a winter storm that has grounded virtually every flight out of England. Except one. A handful of people -- a miserable drunk, a lecherous couple, a foul-mouthed mob boss and his two bodyguards, two unhinged army dudes, a religious leader, a woman on vacation, and an elderly gentleman escorting a precious cargo (among others) -- are allowed onto the only flight that is able to make it ahead of the storm. However, once they are airborne (we have movie title!), it turns out that the storm is the least of their concerns.It turns out that a lot of hazards await our passengers. The way they are laid out for the audience, they all come across as a little unclear and a lot silly. I mean, I could explain them for you pretty clearly, but the movie is less interested in back story and exposition than it is in trying to establish an atmosphere of uncertainty and chaos. After all, in a mid-air plane, those are the things that create the most suspense and fear. Unfortunately, the movie's characters are so formulaic that they seem far too at home in their roles, and whatever atmosphere of uncertainty there should be is lost in predictable shenanigans.This is not to say that the movie doesn't try to push its way past predictability. A barely recognizable Mark Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker) is by far the best player in this drama as an air traffic head honcho on his very last day of duty. His role seems pretty thankless at the start of the film, but he pulls his own by the time the hard rock credits roll. I guessed most of the film's twists up to (and including) the final scene, but although they were, alone, fairly derivative, their intertwining at the conclusion was something I haven't seen before. In other words, the film was like a horror movie you've seen before mixed with a thriller you've seen before. Neither one was particularly unique, but at least I can say I've never watched them both at the same time.If the script or characters had gone beyond mere caricature, there might be something here to stick with you past the last kernel of popcorn in your bucket. As it is, this is a not particularly bad or good little mix-em-up (definitely not horror, no matter what the trailers or movie poster might suggest) that barely lasts longer than its final scene. It'll make you feel smarter because it's so easy to predict, but there's little doubt it'll leave enough of an impression for you to feel like recommending it to your friends.",N/A

1505864,"2 headed shark attack is a good movie but it has some flaws to it. I will tell you about it in my review right now.The bad things about this movie is that the asylum is lacking in computer graphics,the acting is ok but,is like the graphics it's kinda youtube graphics(the graphics are low classed). The camera working needs work because the movie is mostly computer graphics they need to show more stuff that does not need any computer graphics. Now the nudity scene it doesn't make any sense in this movie, they shouldn't have any nudity in it. When the shark was chasing the boat, the shark's only head left it was switching sides of it's body and it's pretty embrassing to do that. And finally about the story, this movie would be more better by showing how the shark came into being.The good thing about this movie is that it has a good level of gore, nice level of violence, good action thats happening in some parts of the movie, some suspense. And maybe everybody would like a really good ending.So keep telling what you feel about this movie ok.",N/A

1467883,"There's a line about a character from the movie Sin City that goes: ""He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century.""That sentiment somewhat applies to John Carter, in that while its effects are as modern as they come, the script feels like it grew from the 1980s, and I mean that as a compliment.  It was a fantastic time for action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy films. John Carter is impressive in its creation of a world, but it's also impressive in how deftly it avoids many annoying trappings of modern films of its like.  Sidekicks aren't annoying, there aren't any pop culture references, no wink at the camera nonsense.  It manages to not take itself too seriously, while also sticking wholly to its own world.Story in quick form:  a former Confederate soldier on a gold hunt ends up being transported to Mars, which contrary to popular belief is teeming with life--life that wants to kill other life.  Much as he wants to avoid war, Carter is swept up in one far, far from his home.That description does little justice to the movie.  War?  Not a fun subject, and often its the climactic ""charge!"" scene to many of today's sci-fi and fantasy movies.  John Carter keeps the pace strong throughout with good humor, amazing effects, and action scenes you can follow easily, from tower-hopping to airship-traversing sword fights to a little dog-monster that manages to be adorable while biting people's heads off.I fell in love with the movie because of the jumping most of all.  Because of the lower gravity on Mars and Carter's muscle density (or something), he's a lot stronger and more spry on Mars than he was on Earth.  He can leap all over the place and it's when he's doing this that the movie's magic comes to life.  Jumping between airships, jumping between towers, jumping from battle to battle--you want to be doing the same.The effects are amazing, the score is a classic--if I had to complain, I'd say there are a couple clunky lines and the beginning is a little messy, though it quickly straightens out.  What's stronger than all that is the heart of this movie, and I don't mean in the sappy family film sense.  I mean there's a heart of courage, strength, a sense of old school right and wrong that I normally don't get invested in, but here it was all so fun that I couldn't help enjoying it.  The movie really came together when you realize just how insidious the situation of the war is, and how important it is that John Carter is an outsider coming into this situation.  He's someone who can change it.Overall, don't come into this as cynically as I did.  The movie had to win me over, and it did, but it shouldn't have had to.  John Carter is about having a good time. If you're looking for that, you'll find it here. My DVD's already pre-ordered.",N/A

153442,"Enjoyable low-budget romp based off of the Jules Verne novels Robur the Conqueror and Master of the World, but, oddly, using only the second one's title. Vincent Price stars as self-proclaimed ""master of the world"" Robur, inventor of a giant flying zeppelin named the Albatross, who abducts Charles Bronson's stoic police inspector and Henry Hull's blustery balloonist and his daughter, played by the fetching and strong-willed Mary Webster. Also along for the ride is Webster's idiotic, cowardly fiance played by David Frankham who does nothing but whine and be a jerk.The screenplay by Richard Matheson is on the talky side with little in the way of action, but it's intelligently written and has some extremely quotable scenes. Prince really sinks his teeth into the part of the determined and passionate Robur, providing a less manic and composed alternative to James Mason's intense Captain Nemo in Disney's earlier 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.Although Matheson insisted Charles Bronson was ""miscast"" as John Strock, he does his best in a pretty basic hero role that just calls for him to be square-jawed, stoic and punch henchmen. The stoic and square-jawed Bronson is perfect for punching henchmen, so I'm unsure what Matheson is talking about. His cool, quiet demeanor acts as a nice counterbalance to Price's more animated, over the top (but still enjoyable) performance.Mary Webster's Dorothy is little more than someone for Bronson and Frankham to fight over and for Hull to act protective toward, but nevertheless, she does have an arc, albeit a pretty standard one, wherein she finds the guts to stand up to wimpy heel Frankham's Phillip and choose the manlier Strock. This just leaves Henry Hull. Many viewers complain that he overacts in his role as Dorothy's father, but, frankly, that's what makes his role so enjoyable. He's hilarious and provides much better comic relief than Vito Scotti's horrific performance as the Albatross' resident ""French"" chef. His dinner table debate with Price as Robur is one of the film's best scenes.Add a few steampunk sci-fi elements like a cool giant airship and ""futuristic"" flintlock pistols (basically just embellished with some added on silver parts) and you've got yourself a pretty solid, but not great, movie. The only thing that sinks it is its low budget which necessitates the over reliance on stock footage. Beyond this, I found it just as enjoyable as the earlier Verne epics Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Fox's Journey to the Center of the Earth.",N/A

144992,"Alan Parker's 1980 film about a group of students at New York City's School for the Performing Arts came out at the perfect time. The late Seventies was a time when NYC seemed at its scariest and most dangerous, but works from the era like the film SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and the musical A CHORUS LINE showed how the city still retained its promise as a place where dreams of making it in the world of entertainment could still happen; this film almost magically recaptures that sense of precariousness between a falling-down infrastructure and social system and the hope of that old Broadway dream. Parker, the director, has a terrific visual sense, and some of the most stunning sequences, such as a Puerto Rican-American young comedian (Barry Miller) from the South Bronx racing through the rubble of his neighborhood to tell his mother he's made it into the school, play off this balance. So too do some of the beautiful scenes shot in the ramshackle old Manhattan schools the film used for the production when they were barred from using the actual School for the Performing Arts for locations. The other thing that really puts the film over are the superb young performers who play the central student characters--Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane, Lee Curreri, and especially Gene Anthony Ray--, many of whom were chosen from the actual School for the PA (or from schools much like it). They do much to offset the dialogue's cheesy bathos and the film's ramshackle episodic structure. The songs and dances are energetic and exciting, especially the famous ""Hot Lunch Jam"" near the film's beginning (even though it's hard to believe cafeteria workers would really be thrilled to see students dancing on the tables).",N/A

1499311,"Do you have a plan for your retirement? A condo, maybe? Las Vegas, Miami, Scottsdale? What about India? It's probably not your first choice. But then it wasn't the first choice for most of the characters in this film, and they still ended up there. Wanna know why?Evelyn Greenside (played by Judi Dench) is a housewife who was recently widowed. In addition to her grief, her husband's death has left her with massive debts. While discussing her husband's account with a representative of her internet service provider, she causes an abrupt change in tone when she informs the person on the other end of the phone, whose Indian accent is easily noticeable, that her husband is dead. We are later introduced to a High Court judge named Graham Dashwood. Dashwood (played by Tom Wilkinson) is on his way to the most recent in what seems to be an endless series of retirement parties. He's dreading the event a great deal and, rather than suffer through the festivities, he simply says, ""This is the day"" as a way of announcing his own retirement and then leaves the party without another word. Next, we have the Ainslies. Douglas Ainslie (played by Bill Nighy) and his wife Jean (played by Penelope Wilton) are exploring a number of less-than-enticing bungalows where they might spend their golden years. They'd hoped for something grander, but invested a large portion of their savings in their daughter's internet business and have yet to see that business turn a profit. Muriel Donnelly (played by Maggie Smith) is a cantankerous former housekeeper who needs a hip replacement but finds the wait, cost, and personnel at her local hospital unappealing. All these characters are made aware, in varying ways, of a seemingly beautiful retirement community in India named The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful. However, when they arrive, they soon find out that Sonny, the hotel's young and enthusiastic manager (played by Dev Patel), has misrepresented the accommodations at the hotel. He neglected to mention the hotel's shabby appearance, failing plumbing, and non-functioning phone service.Now I failed to introduce two other characters in the story. They are single by choice and have come to India looking for romance. Without cluing you in to the ending, the film avoids the obvious cliche of the two finding love in each other's arms while still allowing them to find contentment. For that reason and others, I loved this film. There are twists, surprises, happy endings, not-so-happy endings. All that merely punctuates the brilliant portrayals offered by a cast that already has many on their respective resumes. The inexplicably optimistic character played by former Slumdog Millionaire and now supporting actor on HBO's The Newsroom, Dev Patel is a constant source of amusement.

1454708,"In my opinion Rush is the greatest power trio ever. I have seen them live numerous times and they never disappoint. This new offering is great. Just hearing all of Moving Pictures is worth the price.The blu-ray transfer is good but not perfect. The show starts off a little slow, the band has some tempo issues, and one of the cameras used on Geddy is not as sharp as the other. I don't remember what song it is but you notice Alex talking to Neil about the tempo being too fast or slow and you clearly see Neil say ""I know"". The surround and stereo mixes are very good. Great set-list and the comical videos are a bonus. The video editing at times is too abrupt for my tastes and some of the overhead shots of Neil are out of sync. Also, do we really need to see Neil's feet? Not much on bonus material but how often do you watch bonus stuff anyway?For me, I still like Rio the best. Yes the sound was not as good but the band was on fire and Geddy's voice held up better. Overall, this is a must for any Rush fan and I hope they continue to rock out as long as they can.",N/A

An evil terrorist threatens Batman's beloved Gotham City and he has to shake off his physical and mental depression and save the city or watch as it is destroyed.The cinematography and characters were excellent and the acting was well done.  The movie was very good but for me it seemed just a bit long as if they did not know how to reduce its size.  It is an excellent close to the trilogy through. The movie contained a lot of character development and flashbacks to build the scenario of what was taking place and why the characters behaved the way they did.  I think that is why the movie was so long but it still held our interest as the storyline was good.  The character Bane (Tom Hardy) was portrayed as a cold blooded and vicious killer with no respect for personal life.

1402122,"For the first half hour or so Johnny English Reborn is a surprisingly funny spy spoof that's a huge improvement on the dire first big screen outing for Rowan Atkinson's hopeless yet supremely self-confident spy who was originally dreamt up for a series of credit card adverts and seemed ill-suited for anything longer than 30 seconds. Where that misfired more than it hit, the sequel begins rather well as the now disgraced spy is called out of his retreat in a Tibetan monastery (where he's learning, among other things, the martial art of dragging boulders with his testicles) by a reluctant MI7 to uncover an assassination plot aimed at the Chinese premier.Some of the jokes are out of date - his sparring with Gillian Anderson's unimpressed spymaster, all impeccable but monotonous pronunciation, is like a flat rewrite of Judi Dench's scenes in GoldenEye that's 16 years too late - but there's plenty that does raise a smile or the odd laugh, not least a particularly well-executed parkour chase scene across the rooftops and along the dockside of Hong Kong where the joke is that, despite obvious audience expectations, English's ineptitude constantly fails to materialise as he never puts a foot wrong and repeatedly outthinks a killer with a minimum of effort. But once the action leaves Hong Kong it obviously forgets to pack the jokes for the return trip and becomes a tired but watchable run-through of stale routines that weren't that funny when they were being done back in the 60s when people first started making mediocre Bond spoofs - the clumsy would-be knowing banter with a villain over a game of golf, the gadget filled chase scene (here in a motorised wheelchair), the assassination attempts by a ridiculous villain (here an elderly Chinese cleaning lady) survived through dumb luck rather than skill... you've seen it all before, and better done, and compared to the likes ofOSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spiesit seems stuck in the last century in the wrong way.There are some compensations, with the biggest surprise how much better Rosamund Pike is here than in her genuine Bond film, Die Another Day, giving a much more natural and appealing performance in a role that's not much more than reaction shots and exposition before turning into the romantic interest just because that's part of the formula. It's a shame that she doesn't get more to do, but that could apply to most of the cast in a comedy that seems to have been made by a director who doesn't really want to do a comedy in a classic case of trying to turn the film he's been hired to make into the different kind of film he'd rather be making instead.That problem is increasingly apparent from the deleted scenes on the Blu-ray and director Oliver Parker's rationale for cutting most of the funnier moments purely to keep the story moving while bizarrely leaving the now redundant and occasionally laborious moments setting them up in the final cut: in this kind of film the story is really nothing more than a near irrelevant coat rack to hang the jokes on, and it's the jokes that should take priority. As he rationalises his decisions as ""small sacrifices worth making"" to get to the next mundane plot point you can't help thinking he's the kind of director who'd cut the farting cowboys out of Blazing Saddles because it wasn't really moving the story forward. Not that there's much originality on display in them, but some - an extended walk-through the newly privatised MI7, English so preoccupied with trying out the gadgets in his car that he doesn't notice machine-gun firing killers are chasing him or a throwaway gag with some exploding chewing gum - are much better than what did make the final cut even if they did need a bit of tightening. The same could be said of the deleted scenes presentation as well since the disc doesn't offer the option to skip Parker's near-identical explanations for cutting the jokes out of a comedy.Aside from a decent 25-minute making of and a not particularly funny gag reel the rest of the extras are the usual puff pieces on how Atkinson is the comic Messiah, though his perfectionism is absent from what makes it to the screen in the last two thirds of the movie. Like so many movies shot digitally rather than on film the 2.35:1 widescreen picture quality tends to vary from sharpness (usually in studio scenes and the Hong Kong section) to a rather soft, pallid, undetailed and lifeless look (most of the exteriors) but is acceptable.",N/A

1115120,"Its cute and quirky. Song Seung Heon plays Ji Eun Sung, a high school bully. He's the leader of a small gang and is the best fighter around, aside from fighting though, he cannot stand to be touched. Jung Da Bin plays Han Ye Won, a very plucky girl. She stands up to Eun Sung and in the process accidentally kisses him.  He demands that she ""take responsibility"" for him and so sort of forces her to be his girlfriend.As the movie goes on you can see that both of them are actually developing feelings for one another, but in a very clumsy way, so they end up hurting each other.  Slowly he tries to give up his bullying ways for her, but she doesn't realise it.The movie has a lot of goofy, physical humor in it (the first time they meet face to face they are in a hair salon, he has a dye cap on while she has a perm treatment---and then they chase each other down the street, its a pretty great visual). It is also, has a neat bit of cultural stigma in it, from when it is set and explores what it was like to be that first generation of children growing up in a world with AIDS.I really like the soundtrack of this movie too, same quirkiness as the visuals.An enjoyable film that I'd say is mostly a comedy, some romance, some action and some drama.",He Was Cool

1509205,"I've never been entirely convinced by Wim Wenders as a narrative film director-- his talents have always been more situated in the realm of conceptual art than that of the storyteller.  Here he gets a chance to apply his conceptual art strengths to one of the few great artists of our time, Pina Bausch.  The results are often startling, enthralling, and affirmative.The opening excerpt from Bausch's RITE OF SPRING ranks as one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen.  There is no doubt that Wenders has found the best possible use for 3D.  To be frank, I would have preferred to see the entire performance rather than the documentary which enfolds it, but ideally we can have both (hint to distributors: there are at least five DVDs to be gleaned from the various dances here.  I'd buy all of them!!)The central section of the film includes excerpts from Bausch's more cerebral work, and it is here that perhaps the film is less effective.  While the work itself is absolutely fascinating, the series of tableaux which Wenders constructs breaks the spell essential to fully entering Bausch's world.  On the other hand, Wenders does create some extraordinary moments possible only through film-- by, for example, intercutting between dancers of various ages-- thus participating in the creative process and making the film itself a document keeping Bausch alive.Meanwhile, we get- a la ""A Chorus Line,""  the dancers themselves, introduced in close ups Avedon would have been proud of.  This device is interesting, if not, perhaps, in the end, terribly well integrated.  Threading through the film as a leitmotif we get a processional that reminded me of the end of 8 1/2 (A.O. Scott cites ""The Seventh Seal,"" which also suggested itself to me).  It works (we are reassured that the stream of energy Bausch left behind remains) but these cinematic gestures don't approach the brilliance of the work celebrated by the film itself (which is just as it should be, I suppose).All in all, not one of the greatest documentaries of all time, but absolutely essential, nonetheless.

I don't care what Edgar Rice Burroughs thinks , or thought. Johnny Weissmuller is the best Tarzan ever. Oh sure, there have been physically more muscular Tarzan's and all that stuff, and Tarzan's with the right hair, and Tarzans that portrayed Tarzan as written in the novels, but without that classic Tarzan yell you got nothing. Don't believe the stories about all the different noises mixed together. That yell was Johnny with just a touch of audio enhancement to give it that fuller sound. His acting as Tarzan is far more brilliant than he's given credit for. Just look at his eyes as he displays childlike bewilderment and self assuredness at the same time. And that stilted speech comes across as something more believable than being able to speak Oxford English. There are other Tarzan movies and tv shows that borrow the yell, but it fits best here.",The Tarzan Collection Starring Johnny Weissmuller: (Tarzan the Ape Man / Escapes / and His Mate / Finds a Son / Secret Treasure /and more)

1326951,"*It should be noted that this film is more worthy of 3.5 stars, ergo only slighty above average*This is an interesting film with a more or less realisitic approach to its subject; being a ""super hero"". Good performances by the cast help bring together the movie in a way that allows yourself to care for them as individuals. However this film is not so outstanding that I can hold your attention the entire way through. I found myself pausing it at certain points to go about other things I needed to do, however I was always pleased to come back and watch it as well. Arthur, played by Woody Harrelson, is a somewhat simple minded man who's biggest crime is caring about others. While is a way he is seeking revenge it never seems like it is mean spirited, merely justified. Not so much an action piece as Kick-Ass, or even a dark or real super hero movie, this is more of a character study of the good will of certain people. Woody Harrelson's performance is the best part of the film and is quite believable. Defendor is an interesting movie, that may make you reflect on certain parts of your own life or opinions, and is very well acted. However it is not engrossing or captivating enough to merit it a rave review, or anything above 4 stars at the most.",Defendor
1522943,"Dark Shadows is a Gothic TV show of the likes of which has never been seen before and we likely will never see anything quite like it again. Dark Shadows began as a traditional soap opera but soon found a charm in Gothic storylines borrowed from classic works of literature like Jane Eyre, Turn of the Screw and Dracula.The show is extremely atmospheric with subtle nods to several classic works of Gothic literature from Bram Stoker's Dracula and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. I think I like the series best in the 700 to 900 or so episodes (there were over 1,200 episodes) because I feel the show really hit it's stride there. The first 210 episodes are forgettable but once Barnabas Collins joins the show things gradually start to improve and fast becomes the most complelling, complex, Gothic creation to ever appear on television.Dark Shadows is part drama, part Gothic horror and part science fiction, including such plot lines as the vampire, Barnabas Collins, having to time travel to 1897 in order to save a man from becoming a malicious ghost that torments children in 1968. The show is so iconic that it can boast to being the first thing to ever air on the Scifi channel. When the Scifi Channel first started the first thing they ever aired was the introduction of Barnabas Collins (episodes 210 and 211) of Dark Shadows.I strongly recommend Dark Shadows for anyone who loves a good, spooky Gothic horror-fantasy romance or even urban fantasy. There is a brilliant timelessness to Dark Shadows that I've seen in few other things such as Hammer Horror movies and Tim Burton films. I strongly recommend Dark Shadows.",Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series

469761,"I wanted to see this to see what all the fuss was about as it caused a major stir at the time. It is one of the first hand held camera film mockumentary flicks that resulted in a tirade of mockumentaries, the recovered footage genre, including District 9, Apollo 18, and [REC]. The hand held camera work is at first interesting and then nauseating and you wish they could keep it still. The ordinary production is all part of the set up to the famous ending that still makes me shudder. It is the creepy atmosphere and odd feel of the film that makes it scary, rather than what is said or the actual events.The fear in the eyes of the players is quite disturbing as they look genuinely terrified. This translates to the audience also and one never knows what to expect next. The dialogue is virtually improvised and even the actors do not know what is going on adding to the morbid fear. As such this is a curio that is worth seeing once and then perhaps forgetting.The realism of the content, as though someone left a camera running and now we are seeing it unfold, was an innovative idea but has since been flogged to death. The sequel 'Book of Shadows' is one of the worst films ever made as it completely removes the doco feel with hand held cam and suffers terribly as a result.",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

(However, The Artist earned Best Picture fair and square; I think that Viola Davis should have tied with Meryl Streep for Best Actress, though I have not yet seen The Iron Lady, and that Berenice Bejo & Jessica Chastain should have tied with Octavia Spencer for Best Supporting Actress; it has happened before, you know...two actors winning the same award).

Though I will not say what that aspect is, I just had to say that.I give the movie three stars because it profanes God's name by combining His Name wth a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity.

858635,"""Going up River"" is a short 88 minute documentary on Massachusetts Senator and former presidential candidate John Kerry. Although it is obviously pro-Kerry in the election year of 2004, I found that many of the men he served with testified to the strength of his character and leadership underfire, giving it substantial credibility.  It is the answer to the 2004 Swift Boat Veterans for Truth smear campaign against Kerry that focused on a small number of men who also served in the ""brown water navy"" in the Mekong Delta and on the coast. The crew which Kerry commanded on his small patrol craft would go on the record and coroborate the commendations that Kerry recieved, which the SBVT claimed were ""exaggerated.""This controversy stems all the way back to the Nixon era, as this film reveals portions of Nixon's secret recordings where he recognizes Kerry as a strong speaker and a definate ""Kennedy"" type, making him a formidable opponent. Kerry's appearings before a congressional commitee as spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) features prominently in this doc, and brought Kerry to national status overnight, prompting Nixon to arrange John O'Neill, another Naval officer loyal to the war effort to debate Kerry on the Dick Cavett show.  O'Neill would later be one of Kerry's largest detractors in the 2004 campaign, which evidences the truism that politicians have long memories. Many members the the George W. Bush administration got their start under Nixon, with VP Cheney and Defense Sec. Rumsfeld among them. They clearly had not forgotten Kerry's leadership of ""long haired communist sympathizers"", who were believed to be traitors to the US.This film is mainly concerned with Kerry's decision to speak out against a war that almost every veteran felt was unwinnable and mismanaged. Though most of the film concerns Kerry's activism in the VVAW, it is a good picture of the man's early life, as it begins with a brief telling of Kerry's childhood and college years, attending St. Paul's in New Hampshire, then Yale.  Kerry was obviously very much affected by the Kennedys and his entrance into Massachusetts politics in the 1980's was directly under the guidance of Ted Kennedy (though this film only covers the first 30 years of his life). The relevance of this movie shows the divisions in American society that started with the assassination of President Kennedy, the hasty entrance into a war 13,000 miles away little more than a year later and civil rights issues. The men that Kerry represented were full of anger when they returned home at the propaganda that surrounded Vietnam and the disparity between the fiction presented to the US public and the reality of the war over seas. This led to some excesses within the anti-war movement, among them the SDS radicals and the Weathermen who advocated for armed resistance and overthrow of the government. To many people, the VVAW and the SDS type groups were one in the same, but as many veterans pointed out, they are not. In his own words, Kerry states that the protests he led in April of 1971 were designed to stop the unecessary violence, not create more of it. Needless to say, any scholar of the Vietnam era knows that hard feelings were born on both sides, ones that carried over into the next generation. Kerry's 2004 campaign was seriously damaged by the Swift Boat Veterans, who through massive publicity spin, turned  a man who could've easily obtained a deferment into a traitor, because he believed in speaking the truth rather than hiding the reality from the public.  Though Kerry nearly rose to the highest office in the country, his life and work are reminders of the vicious internal conflicts in Cold war America that still cause reprecussions today.",Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry

This movie also contains some of their best dancing and most beautiful music (The great Jerome Kern) of any of their films, from the lighthearted and fun, ""Pick Yourself Up"", where Fred pretends he can't dance so that he can meet dance instructor, Ginger, to their great, ""Never Gonna Dance"" number near the end of the film. In between we have the beautiful and tender, ""Waltz In Swing Time"", and one of Astaire's most stunning dance solo's, ""Bojangles Of Harlem""! That number was meant to be a loving tribute to legendary, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, and while it was performed in black face, it was NOT meant to be racist!

1325929,"Of all the subjects of the FINAL 24 series, I guess you could say I'm most familiar with Janis Joplin's sad story.  There isn't too much in this documentary that was totally unfamiliar to me, and if you've read the multiple bios or even if you were simply alive at the time and more or less aware of pop culture, you'll likely find that to be the case as well.  So the filmmakers get a ""A"" for accuracy, but the premise of the ""final 24"" is nonetheless creepily morbid.  The re-enactments are as good as you could hope for (with an anonymous actress who actually DOES look like a bit like the rock legend--and moves like her), but it's still seems a bit unseemly to watch, what with the digital  countdown timer and all.  Still if Janis' good buds like John Cooke, John Till, Sam Andrew (almost unrecognizable), Dave Getz and Powell St. John can contribute to the project in good conscience, I guess I can allow myself the indulgence of watching it.  Rounding out the commentary are sections featuring her younger brother Michael, whose comments about his big sister and ""role model"" are touching and a high school friend named Jim Langdon and, not insignificantly, publicist Myra Friedman who authored the first (and some would say most authoritative--and certainly the best TITLED) Joplin biography BURIED ALIVE.For many contemporary viewers, this doc will serve to clear up a number of the myths that have sprung up about Janis'life and death.  To say nothing of the outright lies.  I remember reading a claim by Warhol hanger-on Ultra-Violet that she had been in California when Joplin died and had actually DISCOVERED the singer's body (in Joplin's APARTMENT no less)!  Self-promoting BS like that begs for a corrective.

975856,"I have watched two of the 'Ida Lupino movies' (ones she directed)and I could have a shelf full if they were available. She really gets to the heart of the matter. I always wish there was a bit more just to see more of what she put together. I really enjoy the cast. they seem to work well together from what it seems coming across the screen. The movies hold the 'necessaries' for the subjects being presented. (the one on polio/ disabilities and again here with an unexpected pregnancy.) I appreciate the way 'shame' is approached and the people brought in with such compassion. Showing a true-to-life approach at the 'delicate/difficult' subjects. And timeless lessons.The films might not hold the interest of younger children, yet they are done with a taste that anyone could be in the room watching or overhearing. (Yes, the always present cigarette and touches of 'drink' are there, yet the cigarette thing was not realized for far too long.) At one part, the cigarette seemed to portray the stepping stones in the lives of the Sally Forrest characters. Speaking of which, the two main actors are really good. As I stated before, they blend together. They showed quite a bit of the baby's father, a bit more of his feelings and also the girl's attempt to interest him in making 'things permanent' without either of them knowing her situation. No manipulation on her part. Just trusting. An all-too-familiar story done so well here. Along with the portrayal of not-so-perfect homelife. That part in itself ought to get folks thinking - how parents might act and react differently.  Good threads all thru the movie and some the viewer is left to 'write' on their own. ""Food for thought"", so to say!I did sorta think that maybe the long stairway scene at end of ""Unwed Mother"" would have been difficult for the handicap 'Drew', that maybe he could have been going up the last one and fallen, and then Sally would have had to 'bend pride' a bit to 'return' to him and then assist Drew. Meet 'halfways' so to say, to show an action of compassion to match his, I guess is a good way to explain what I am trying to say here.

320473,"THE GREAT DICTATOR (Writ./prod./dir/ Charlie Chaplin, 1940, 125 minutes) is probably one of the top 50 films of all time. It introduced a comedic style that would be anemically furthered by luminaries such as Sid Caesar and even nearly equaled by the likes of Stanley Kubric, but no one would ever really be able to do it again.Here Chaplin has double roles, as the dictator Adenoyd Hinkel (often incorrectly spelled as ""Adenoid Hynkle"") of the satirical country of Tomania (a/k/a Tomainia) and Osterlich, and as a Jewish barber who is much more than the Tramp in a ghetto. With incredibly hilarious scenes that do not lose their fresh humor - in fact they have gained with age - there are key scenes such as the fuehrer's private dance with a globe of the world, his encounters with the Mussolini-based Italian dictator Napaloni of Bacteria, and of course the switch of the Jewish barber's identity with that of the dictator.People say the ending, with the Jewish barber in disguise and speaking as the dictator, is corny and maudlin. They said so at the time. But in speaking as himself, as Charlie Chaplin, directly to the camera, pleading for peace and understanding, it is a powerhouse performance never tried by anyone again.So it is incredibly hilarious, inspired 1,001 great films, and is simply a must-own. You need your head examined if you say you like cinema and haven't even seen this film, which one can say was Chaplin's ultimate crowning political achievement.There has to be a list of ""did you know"" details to kick it off:-Hitler ordered this film twice for his viewing pleasure and it has been stated that he would have loved the comedy, though he banned and hated Chaplin-Chaplin regretted ever doing this film because as he stated, he would have never released it had he known exactly what Hitler had done-Chaplin was one of the most prominent political statesmen in film, starting with his overtly politicalModern Times(1936, in which he criticized greedy corporate factories such as Henry Ford's) and essentially ending with DICTATOR. (In fact these are the only films Chaplin made from 1936 to 1940.) Chaplin expertly criticized greedy corporate capitalism, the 'big brother' attitude, dictatorships and false promises of peace. The central message of DICTATOR is peace.-Chaplin was going directly up against Hitler with this film, and studied newsreels of Hitler in order to satirize him flawlessly.-Based on absolutely nothing, the Nazis branded Chaplin a Jew, and he never denied it.-Chaplin shot personal color home movies of the entire shooting of DICTATOR which is shown in Turner Classic Movie's 55 minute documentary, THE TRAMP AND THE DICTATOR (unavailable anywhere on DVD as far as I can tell).",N/A

Apparently she was supposed to be a sympathetic character but she came off as simply a pathetic, whining, self pitying, anorexic jerk. Why on earth would any girl get so bent out of shape by the engagement of a girl who was supposed to be her best friend that she just goes nuts. Or, was she nuts all along and the engagement just pushed her over the edge. It leaves you with the impression that this friendship was the only thing she had and if it was changing then she just had to behave so badly that everyone would notice her instead of the bride. Instead of being happy and supportive of her friend, she made the whole thing about her starting with the way too long scene near the beginning of the movie where she competes with the stepmother in making the toast. And, couldn't they have found a better looking bride.  That girl was just ""plain"". But, the movie was funny and I guess that is what it was meant to be. The scene near the end where she keeps racing her car up and down breaking all kinds of laws trying to make the policeman notice her was too long and annoying also. Contrived is what comes to mind. Halfway through the movie, you simply don't care about this ""heroine"" anymore. You just want her to gain a little weight, get a job, actually care about her friend's happiness and, for the love of Pete, stop whining.  The fat girl was the best thing in the movie.

395800,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (Alice in Wonderland). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.Review of this 1975 Adult version...I think it is great that someone made an adult movie based on Alice in Wonderland. Why? Mainly because the Alice story has manifested in virtually all other formats (cartoons, musicals, plays, ballets, operas, etc.), so why not?So what are you getting into if you watch this movie? First let's touch on the sex, because that's what everybody cares about. I viewed only the harder to find original uncut version (downloaded it from Youtube). It wasn't that I wanted to see the sex per se, I wanted to see the movie the film makers intended to make. I can tell you that the sex is definitely explicit. Explicit explicit. However, these passages are not long and drawn out. This is not a porno film with some Alice in Wonderland dialog. This is a movie that has a storyline, and that storyline is a transposition of Alice, instead of dealing with the issues of growing up in general, is more specifically dealing with the issues of maturing into a sexual being. It's life folks. So yes, there's some outright porn... but in fact this production is really ""erotica"".The movie is piloted by young, pretty, sexy, and slightly barely legal 21 year old Kristine DeBell. She's great!An example of how Carroll's plot lines were transposed into sexual themes would be instead of Alice running in circles in a Caucus race to dry off from the pool of tears, the animals lick her dry. Ooooh.Another example is Humpty Dumpty has a broken... you know. And, they showcased Tweedledee and Tweedledum as brothers and sister in love with each other. Ha ha.The writers are clever, and they extend Carroll's tendency to play on words into the topic of the movie. The movie is actually full of humor. There are many dance numbers using actual dancers... It's a musical. A comical, sexy, musical.

1319177,"I stumbled on this film by chance - I had never heard of it nor knew anything about it, so I had zero expectations.  What a gem I discovered - this is an amazingly good movie.  I might otherwise give it four stars, but chose five to try to correct for some of the one star reviews that might prevent others from checking this movie out.  Pay no mind to those one-star reviewers - their brains have been eaten by zombies.Lake Mungo  centers around the tragic drowning of a 16 year-old girl, and her grieving family's belief that her ghost is present in the house, perhaps needing to communicate something about her death.  The format is faux documentary - but there is never any doubt that it is scripted.  I don't think the director intended us to believe otherwise.  The real-world rough edges are smoothed out to better draw us into his eerie one.  The performances are wonderfully understated, underscoring the surreal mood.  And it may have been filmed on a low budget, but there is million-dollar talent behind that camera. Most impressive were the ""ghost"" scenes - they are shot like a disturbing dream, the kind you have when you are unsure if you are dreaming or awake.  Not to get all highbrow, but I was reminded of Igmar Bergman's Persona. There were scenes in that film that blurred the line between The dream and waking worlds that left me with an uneasy, creepy feeling,  just like Lake Mungo did.I think the preponderance of negative reviews on this site are from those who were expecting cheap thrills.  There are none to be had here, but the patient viewer is left with a more enduring, subtle horror.  There are a few unexpected twists that may leave some viewers rolling their eyeballs, but hang in there.  Not all is as it seems. There's a quote from the doomed girl that still sends chills up my spine:  ""I feel like something bad is going to happen to me.  Like it already has.  It just hasn't reached me yet.  But it's coming.""",N/A

1357712,"The story itself would be pretty run-of-the-mill ex-spies on the run being hunted down for what they know (yep, basically Bourne series was the latest to mine this) but this movie reaches far beyond its B movie roots because of an excellent cast. Bruce Willis channels his best stoic Die Hard character. The woman from Big (Mary Louise Parker) is plausible as his love interest.

Obviously, the actors had a ton of fun doing this and that is confirmed by the 30 minute extra on behind the scenes. Also, the director is a genius. His dissolves to each location by slapping up a postcard be it of New Orleans or New York City and how the camera zooms in to the location within the postcard is way cool.The extras also rock as there's a great animated CIA conspiracy history, commentary tracks with an ex-CIA operative on there as well as this Red trivia track you can fool around with.FYI, the movie title does not stand for some Communist plot (although Brian Cox plays an ex-KGB agent) but stands for ""Retired Extremely Dangerous.""",Red

1538724,"""Death to the Daleks"" was one more Dalek adventure set in a quarry in Jon Pertwee's last season as the Doctor, but the story had a topical basis and included enough creative flourishes to make it interesting if not quite a landmark in the series.On their way to a much-deserved holiday on the planet Florana, the Doctor and Sarah make a forced landing on the forbidding, fogbound planet Exxilon when the TARDIS suffers an inexplicable power failure. There the Doctor meets a scientific expedition from Earth also stranded by a mysterious force that consumes all electric power on the planet. The Earth expedition is mining the planet for ""parrinium,"" the only known cure for a fatal space plague that has struck humans living on Earth's outer colony planets. Meanwhile, Sarah discovers a magnificent white citadel topped with a shining beacon but is captured by the Exxilons and prepared for sacrifice for defiling their holy city. Then a Dalek ship lands on the planet, also seeking parrinium, and the robotic creatures are forced into an alliance with the humans because their weapons don't work without electric power (the Daleks themselves, the Doctor reminds us, are powered by psychokinetic energy).Miners' strikes in the early 1970s were causing intermittent power failures in the United Kingdom about the time Terry Nation wrote the script for ""Death to the Daleks,"" so the British people were no strangers to lights out when the story first aired in early 1974. In fact, series rehearsals at Acton had to be scheduled around the power outages. Exterior shooting took place at a quarry near Lulworth Cove in Dorsetshire--a barren landscape to match Exxilon's lifeless terrain--but costume designer L. Rowland Warne turned this liability into an asset by carefully matching the colors of the Exxilons' cloaks to the various shades of sand and rock found in the quarry. The Exxilons thereby blended into the landscape, making them invisible to outsiders (two actors were, in fact, briefly lost when they fell asleep on location in Exxilon costumes). Unfortunately, the costumes got wet in pond scenes and had to be dried with electric heaters overnight to avoid tearing their delicate fabric.Costume design for the subterranean Exxilons who live in caves under the city was subtly different but equally imaginative, and Arnold Yarrow turns in the story's best performance as Bellal, the Exxilon who guides the Doctor to the city and explains its fateful origins. (Yarrow, a diminutive actor, says he based his performance largely on the behavior of bushbabies and other small, big-eyed primates.) Here the story is padded with scenes of the Doctor and Bellal solving potentially fatal brain teasers as they approach the city's central brain.The Special Features menu includes a workmanlike, 27-minute making-of documentary as well as a 23-minute studio recording showing how cast and crew taped the story set by set rather than in chronological scene order, an innovation imposed by director Michael E. Briant. Also included are interviews featuring the long-suffering men inside the Daleks. Such interviews are becoming a treasured resource as more and more cast and crew from the classic series, which debuted almost a half century ago, are lost to old age.",Doctor Who: Death to the Daleks
801519,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com""Out of the Ashes"" deserves 5 stars and more.This is compelling, emotionally gripping motion picture about a true event in history wherein abortion saved the life of many Jewish women.A large number of people who oppose abortion, accept abortion if it is to save the mothers life. A trusted gynecologist told me it is very very rare for an abortion to ever be better for a women's health than carrying the baby full term through to a normal birth.There is one notable exception: Abortion most definitely saved the life of many pregnant Jewish women in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. If it was discovered that a women was pregnant, they were sent immediately to the gas chambers because a women with a baby had no value to do the work the Nazis required them to do.Whether you are pro life or pro abortion, this true, never to be forgotten, must see, heart rending motion picture is about the OB/gynecologist Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) that performed abortions with her bare hands to save the life of Jewish women in the concentration camps.

1540524,"Based on the prize winning short story by Richard Connell, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (RKO, 1932) is about a mad, Russian aristocrat who hunts humans on his remote island. Though the basic premise has been filmed many times, this faithful, first version is still considered the best.The film was produced simultaneously with KING KONG, utilizing the same jungle sets and several of the same cast and crew members. Both films were realized by the producer/director team of Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, with Schoedsack and Irving Pichel sharing director credit on GAME. British stage actor Leslie Banks made his screen debut as the insane Count Zaroff, and plays him to the hilt with appropriate relish. Zaroff's prey includes the shipwrecked big game hunter, Bob Rainsford, well played by the underrated Joel McCrea. This was one of McCrea's first important hero roles which became his forte. The ""prize"" Zaroff hopes to win after the hunt is another shipwreck survivor, Eve Trowbridge, played charmingly by Fay Wray. The lovely actress, best known for her legendary performance in KING KONG, gives THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME something extra Connell's story lacked - sex appeal. This additional element makes Zaroff's distorted obsession with hunting particularly kinky.THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is a prime example of economical movie making of the highest calibre. At a brisk 63 minutes, the first two-thirds of the film is build-up to prepare us for the piece de resistance which is the climactic chase, and once it comes it really pays off. The sequence is one of the most thrilling of the early '30's, with Schoedsack's considerable skill at action pacing in full evidence. The use of various camera angles, close-ups, panning, dolly and tracking shots all combine for a breathless run through a fog shrouded swamp, a dense jungle, across chasms, and over a waterfall. But the one who takes center stage during this sequence is the film's composer, Max Steiner. Structured around the call of a hunting horn, the music acts both as narrative that recalls earlier scenes, and as a vibrantly pulsating force that drives the action persistently forward. Indeed, Steiner's expressive, exciting music for THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME already demonstrated the brilliance that was to fully emerge with his score for KING KONG.While usually thought of as a dry run for Cooper and Schoedsack's tale of the lovestruck giant ape, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME can easily stand on its own merits as a solid, well crafted action/horror/thriller.GOW, THE HEADHUNTER (1931), is an interesting expeditionary film that was compiled from footage of the South Seas Islands shot in the early '20's. Produced by British adventurer Edward A. Salisbury, the film is noteworthy because Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack were among the cameramen. The cannibals they encountered bear certain similarities with Skull Island's natives in KING KONG, right down to the warpaint, costumes, and yes, skulls.GOW is best known as an exploitation film, since it was re-issued that way in the '50's as CANNIBAL ISLAND with Mondo-style narration that was added in 1931 by William Peck, who was one of the original expedition members. The film is of historical value because it documents the customs and lifestyles of savage, primitive tribes that were beginning to fade off from the world scene.Flicker Alley has released both THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME and GOW, THE HEADHUNTER as a double feature Blu-ray edition. Both films have been transferred off 35mm composite master positives. Of the two, GAME benefits the most from the boost to HD, and it surpasses Criterion's DVD. The image clarity is nothing short of spectacular for a film of this vintage, and the soundtrack is equally impressive, without a trace of hiss and delivering a full bodied sound that does Max Steiner's music score the justice it deserves. One can now hear textures in the music that weren't as clear before, and a better bass response without distortion. Considering the quality of its source, GOW still looks good in HD; there are some light lines and white specks, but these are minor and don't detract at all from the viewing experience.GAME has an excellent commentary by USC professor and author, Rick Jewell, and GOW has a new audio essay provided by Matthew Spriggs, Professor of Archaeology at the Australian National University. While Spriggs' essay may be considered more ""politically correct"" than Peck's from 1931, I think his frequent referrals to what he finds offensive in Peck's narration is distracting and unnecessary. In fact, I prefer the '31 voice-over because it's in keeping with the context of the time the movie was made. In addition, part of what makes the film fascinating for me is the fact that someone who was actually on the expedition is relating his first-hand, honest reactions to what he witnessed.Extra features include a slide show with excerpts from Kevin Brownlow's 1971 interview with Merian C. Cooper, a booklet containing notes by Cooper and an essay by Emerson College professor, Eric Schaefer.This is yet another outstanding release from Flicker Alley and I gladly give it my highest recommendation.",N/A

590016,"This is an average film that should have been a good film.  It is unsatisfying.Upon reflection, notwithstanding the Academy Award to Julian Fellows, the problem lies with the script.  It has the wrong feel.  Robert Altman did not understand the culture being depicted, and so it is depicted through a lens that doesn't capture it accurately.  There is dialogue in the script that is just wrong.  There are accents that are wrong.  There is body language that is wrong, that does not fit properly in the class structure of that society.  It isn't badly wrong, but it is consistently wrong throughout the film. It persistently undermines the credibility of the charcters.Notwithstanding reasonable acting, the scripted portrayal of the police inspector and his sidekick is particularly weak. It is utterly ham-fisted - something that fits in an Americn film, perhaps, but not on an English country estate in the early 1930's.  If the Director has decided to make a murder mystery drama, then he needs to make up his mind to do a murder mystery drama.  It cannot include inspector Clouseau and remain a serious film. The weakness of that portrayal undermines both the seriousness of the drama, and the critique of the English class structure.  That is not the only portrayal that is ham-fisted, either.Upper class English society was then (and sometimes even now, is) about reserve, suppression of emotion, subtlety, and irony.  If you were ""in service"" you were ""in service"".  Which member of the household staff in this film behaves as if they were ""in service"" or as if they understand what the term means?  Compare the conduct of the staff in this film with, for example, ""The Remains of the Day"", which captures it far, far better.There is far too much swearing, at the wrong times, for the wrong reasons, in the wrong way, and frequently by the wrong people.We have a Jewish American film producer at an estate in the English countryside, and the problem is that he is peculiar because he is a vegetarian? In that era?  In a society then riven with anti-semitism? Who is kidding whom?His lordship is an industrial sweatshop owner?  Really?  In that era the landed class had a very strong aversion to people who were ""in trade"".  This fellow had multiple illegitimate children with working girls in his sweatshops? Are you doing Dickens, or are you doing Jane Austen?  Make up your mind.Meanwhile his wife cavorts with the staff of strangers at the drop of a hot glass of milk? The scullery maid services every man in the place down in the kitchens, and hasn't been fired long since? Again, who is kidding whom?It's too much.  Way, way, way too much. That concatenation of improbabilities adds up to several shark-jumpings.At the end of the day, it is rooted in a basic problem: The director does not understand the society he is trying to depict on screen, and doesn't get that his portrayal tends to caricature.  It spoils what could have been a much better film.",N/A

16690,"I dogged on Frank Sinatra before for his stilted performance in `Some Came Running' and was somewhat lambasted for it.  While settling in to watch `Pal Joey' I was envisioning a repeat.  What can I say?  I actually really liked his performance here.  He possessed a coolness and a well-rounded edge that elevated his character and created something believable.  He had those moments of restraint and introverted emotion and yet he balanced it out with a simple charm that was genuine and engaging.In `Pal Joey', George Sidney's 1957 musical, Sinatra plays a crooner out of luck until he lucks into a gig that lands him a chance to charm a wealthy widow into giving him his own club.  The only problem is that that widow is jealous of his attention and tries to put a wedge between Joey and his budding romance with one of the showgirls.Sinatra is great here.  He carries the film on his shoulders and delivers a fine performance.  Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak give him a run for his money though, especially Hayworth who ravishes in her last screen performance.  She is intoxicating and sensual and possesses a true sense of power.  Novak comes off a tad stiff in some scenes, especially the early ones, but as the film progresses she gets more comfortable in her performance and truly delivers.  Her take on `My Funny Valentine' is remarkable and possibly the best moment in the film.  The form a cohesive threesome and create some serious charm.  Novak is also a solidified knockout in the film and is, as she puts it, ""stacked"".`Pal Joey' is predictable yet fun and it is pretty to look at with lavish sets and some great costume design (the use of color in particular is wonderful).  It's a nicely done musical with talent to spare.",Pal Joey

1414755,"1996 is such a guilty pleasure type of a year for me.  No matter how many `important' films I see from that year, my heart is always drawn back to that handful of Blockbusters that made a giant splash in with the box-office and won the hearts of the general public.  Whether we're talking about De Palma's avant-garde approach to Ethan Hunt, Baz's brilliant take on Shakespeare or that 60's inspired slice of crowd pleasing pie, `That Thing You Do', I'm sold.  I bought the ticket.  I'm in the seat.  I'm smiling WIDE.  There is another film that made a huge dent the world of cinema that was released that very same year.  Wes Craven's magnum opus; `Scream'.  I know that is a pretty big statement to make, but there are few films PERIOD that have had the same effect on modern cinema as `Scream' has.  The effect has not always been a good one, sure, but it was a BIG one and it still makes ripples in cinema even today, fifteen years after it was originally released.In the latest installment of this series we are reunited with the surviving members of the original `Scream' yet again for a bloody good time.  Instead of trying to create something brand new, `Scream 4' takes on the idea of remaking the original, only with new technology.  A lot of the scenes and plot points and murders are ripped straight from the 1996 original, only with a little tweak here and there to represent the year in which this was made.  So, expect Facebook references and webcams capturing the murders in real time.  Where this is an interesting idea on the outset, it does at times feel redundant and a tad stale.  I wasn't wholly impressed with the way that the party sequence played out.  For as much as they are trying to `one up' the original (a concept stated with obviousness quite a bit) they don't really do that.  Instead they regurgitate scenarios that lack the same wow factor that saturated the original.Remember the garage door scene in the original `Scream'?  So much more terrifying than the one in `Scream 4'.  Do you remember Drew Barrymore's opening scene in `Scream'?  So much more terrifying than the one in `Scream 4'.I'll give `Scream 4' the twist factor, since it was one I didn't expect considering that there were so many other variable options for a killer that seemed more obvious and then when the killer is revealed it seems the most obvious of all, which is rather fascinating in a way.  But, the film's desire to prove a point about instant celebrity status and the obvious deterioration of today's youth is lost in the killer's monologue, which is delivered in a near comical fashion that comes off somewhat stupid.  Maybe the intention was to make the average fame hungry teenager seem crazy, but it felt forced and more like a poorly executed plot point than anything else.But I will say this; I have a newfound respect for Hayden Panettiere, who was all sorts of awesome in this.",N/A

1537402,"South Koreans have a way with film.  In the last decade, they've had a particularly good run at presenting war stories, some from the World War II era and many others exploring the Korean War.  I've had the good fortune of seeing several of them - each one perhaps a bit better than the last - and now I can add MY WAY to the burgeoning list of accomplishments.  It's a big budget critical success that opens your eyes to the plight of people who find themselves equally at odds with themselves as they do the greater world around them.At a time when Japan ruled a smaller Korea, Kim Jung-shik (played by Jang Dong-Gun) and Japanese aristocrat Tatsuo Hasegawa (Joe Odagiri) find themselves as bitter young rivals to the upcoming Olympics.  When Kim and his fellow residents rebel against the Japanese authorities after stripping the young man of a chance to represent his country, they're all conscripted into the Japanese army.  Their fates collide again as Kim's regiment is assigned to Tatsuo, now serving his country as an officer.  When both are seized by the Soviets in a bloody battle, they'll slowly learn to trust one another again until they're separated by the invading German army.  Eventually, they're reunited at Normandy Beach, only days before the fateful invasion of the Allied Forces, when destinies collide in this epic story of survival.And it is a truly epic film.  MY WAY features some powerful performances by all of the principles as well as some fantastic filmmaking at work on all levels.  Director Je-kyu Kang has produced a masterpiece that explores personal conviction and redemption against the backdrop of the international stage.  War is arguably the most horrific form of conflict to explore stories of one's humanity, but the script (which he co-wrote with Byung-in Kim) gives everyone here the chance to explore who they are as individuals as well as members of a greater society.  Kim and Tatsuo end up drivers of their own cruel fates as they are victims of their time, always conscripted to serve some greater enemy.  Where others sell out their souls in order to secure momentary freedom, these two men remain tied to their own convictions - big or small, right or wrong - and they suffer the consequences of their own prejudices.  However, along the way, they manage to retain as much of their dignity as the circumstances allow, and they prove once again that even in the darkest of times there is some goodness to be found in the unlikeliest of friendships.As for the completed product?  The cinematography is breathtaking, at times, and heart-breaking at others.  It's the kind of visual mix reserved for blockbuster films, of which MY WAY definitely deserves to sit side by side.  The director clearly went to great lengths to capture these various terrains - the stark beauty of open fields, the harsh claustrophia of the Russian winters, the majestic swells on the beaches of Normandy - and adapt them to the message of each sequence, and it all looks solid and impactful.  The musical score is equally impressive though perhaps a bit derivative at times.MY WAY was produced by Directors, SK Planet, and CJ Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled through Well Go USA.  The disc looks and sounds exceptional - the picture is stunningly crisp, and the audio is a terrific mix for both the big and the smaller elements.  As is often the case with some of these foreign releases finding distribution in the US, there aren't tons and tons of special features, but, thankfully, MY WAY has a solid few: there's a `making of' featurette along with some behind-the-scenes material, cast interviews, and a director interview.  Also, there's an English-dubbed track which I found helpful given the fact that there are sequences of some rapid-fire dialogue that just doesn't give this ol' pair of eyes enough time to read all of it.  It clocks in at an impressive 143 minutes, but you wouldn't know it; it never felt overlong or overwrought in the slightest, as the focus retains a personal edge throughout.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  MY WAY continues to string of terrific war-related films out of Korea.  Culturally, their artists have latched on to a winning, compelling formula of delivering tales of great conflict alongside some tragic and triumphant personal narratives.  Granted, there were a few sequences - one tinged with fairly predictable character-based humor - that `cheapened' a few moments, but they're very, very small (and completely forgivable) when compared to the epic scope of the picture.  MY WAY walks that line with excellent balance - it's as frightening as it is inspiring - and it's easy to see why the NYC Movie Guru dubbed it the ""most powerful war film since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.""In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at Well Go USA provided me with a DVD screener copy of MY WAY by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",My Way

It takes until the final episode on volume one for the team to assemble. The threads of multiple plot arcs are woven throughout the series. Each episode is a real gem. Marvel villains are the best in the history of comics, and the Avengers are plagued by some of the most powerful.Cons: The series isn't perfect. It is cool they showed how Nick Fury's hair turned partially white, but in a flashback to Graviton's origin years earlier his hair was also white. Animation is such a time consuming process, at first I wondered how they missed that. Then I realized there are so many people working on a series like this the animator was probably working from a Nick Fury style sheet and was likely unaware of the timeline for the scene. This is nit-picking and doesn't detract from how good the series is. I wish they would have issued the complete first season in one package.

1498652,"""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is great feel good film.  I found it to be quite captivating and am very glad that I made the effort to see it.  I recommend it to others.In brief, the film revolves around the coming together of seven elderly and somewhat impecunious Britons who, of their own volition, and quite separately, decide to retire to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur.  They discovered the place on the internet and, as we all should know, the internet can sometimes be a bit misleading.  Indeed, this is the case here.  The hotel had been billed as a marvelous palace when, in fact, it was tired and chaotic.The seven visitors form the key members of the cast and are led by Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy.  Some can adjust to the way of life in India while others fail completely.  Along the way, we are given a peek into daily life in India in all its colour and noise.The movie is often funny but always enthralling.  I will say no more as to the plot.  I have no wish to spoil this film for others. However, I will say that it is money and time very well spent.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

177744,"Richard Burton is Becket, a Saxon and close friend of the king. Peter O'Toole is Henry the Second, Norman King of England some 100 years after the Conqueror. The Saxons still hate and distrust the Normans, and name as traitor anyone who does not also hate them. But Becket, always the brilliant strategist and subtle, very subtle, has been drinking and wenching with Henry since they were youngsters. Henry openly confesses that he loves Thomas, while Thomas is equally blunt about the fact that he cannot love. In fact, the one time he comes close to it, a Welsh princess of great beauty who was captured in the conquest of her father's kingdom, he contrives to give her over to the king.Henry uses this hated Saxon as a tool against the Norman nobles who plot by the very nature of their position, and against the Church, which has various privileges, including being tax exempt. (Some things never change, eh?) So when the old Archbishop of Canterbury dies, Henry appoints the one man he believes he can trust to replace him: Thomas Becket. Becket protests that he is not a priest, but Henry points out that he has already been appointed an archdeacon. He can be ordained one day and be consecrated a bishop the next. And so it is done.What Henry had not anticipated was that Becket would take his position seriously. Just before his ordination, he prays before a crucifix, addressing Christ directly: ""Lord, are you sure you're not laughing at me?""One important privilege enjoyed by the Church was that if a priest was accused of a crime, he was not given over to the civil authorities, but rather to the church, which was responsible for determining his guilt and punishment. Henry declares that this privilege must end, and orders a priest accused of rape to be handed over to the civil authorities. Becket sees this as against the church's authority, and uses the one really serious weapon he has: he excommunicates the civil magistrate.I think the whole thing is pretty historical, so I feel free to leave out a lot of plot details. One line, I believe, is directly a historical quote. When Henry is sufficiently vexed by Becket preferring God over him, and by the use of the power of excommunication, he is getting drunk with several of his noble companions. He shouts the immortal line, ""Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?"" And so they do. They go to the cathedral and murder Becket.One other major talent is involved in this movie, and gets too little exposure. Sir John Gielgud plays King Louis of France. He's very, very smooth.",N/A

I spent a year there in the 2nd I.D., and saw plenty of what the Koreans had to offer, especially in Itaewon (everything on the street sold for 8 dollars).  But the quality of the picture was the same as the first release, and it is not full screen.  There is a letter-box, but is it just not the scale of The Robe.  The story has been fleshed out alot, and we get to see all the characters more fully developed.  I recommend buying this copy if you liked the original offered by Belle and Blade.  The weapons and Russian armour leave nothing to be desired.  Where the producers found T-26 tanks, BA-32 Armoured Cars, and what looked like a BT-7, is beyond me!  The Finns also had a Swedish AB Bofors anti-tank gun! This film is one of the most authenitc WWII films ever made, right down to the Artillery and tracers.",The Winter War VHS

And in no time at all, it appears as if everyone is trying to drive Oberon insane........Why????Ah.That would be telling.A taut crime thriller with almost unbearable tension, the movie succeeds on every level. The acting in general is good but Oberon(who is gorgeous by the way) Tone, Mitchel and Cooke are stand outs.

The posturings of the various characters make absurd conflicts possible which are unique to this film. The central protagonist (Colonel Aldo Rain) is a borderline idiot, and the good guys demonstrate that, in an armed conflict, division into good and bad is mostly conceit: there is really just bad and worse.

For example, in Disc four (4) Episodes 11-13, Episode 12 is missing. And so on and so fourth. Between Disc one (1) and (2), the outside labeling of Episodes is wrong, i.e. Episodes are missing. And since the episodes are NOT labelled on the discs (you cannot see on the TV which Episodes are playing, despite the facts you have to watch the credits again and again) this defect is harder to detect.

1433584,"At first I was really mad with this season for not having enough of Castiel's character in it and then with Bobby dying.  For me it was as bad as when Sirius died in Harry Potter 5.  But then after I bought the season and watched it once, I realized that it is really good, and like always has many excellent episodes.  It made me look forward to season eight completely!  I wish to god that more people watched this show because while there are fantastic european actors in this show, this show is really a display of good American acting and writing.  Especially since right now, alot of the really famous actors in Hollywood don't hold a candle to the acting ability in this show.  And to be honest, alot of the really famous actors in Hollywood out there don't even hold a candle physically to many of the actors in this show.  Jensen and Jared are overwhelmingly talented as well as handsome in a good old fashioned 'manly' way.  They don't look effiminate, or metro, which seems to be haunting the beauty standards of the 'average' male actor these days.  Misha Collins is also very SEXY in that ""I actually look like a deep and complex guy"" way and Jim Beaver is the type of man who you wish your husband looked like when he's in his forties. Crowley's character is also very well acted, along with many of the other ensemble or guest starring actors/actresses.  This is a well done show!  And this is not coming from a overtly critical but hypocritical person. i tried acting and I couldn't do it good to save my life, just like many people who claim to be famous and talented in hollywood are: NOT TALENTED, and don't have the looks to make up for it!  But this show is not the case.  This is a show where there is a synthesis of loads of talent, beauty, good direction, and thought.I wish this show was on the tip off everyone's tongues as opposed to other supposed film 'phenomenons' out there right now that don't deserve the hype they get.But that's just my opinion.",N/A

853642,"This review won't be very visual since I've been blind since birth, but here's hoping I can still convince you to make this purchase.  I had missed watching this series when I was a kid since we didn't get the WB for the longest time.  My little brother was nuts for it back in the late 90's.  I do remember seeing the first 2 parts of the pilot when I was visiting him in Memphis and loving them.  So it was a treat when WB released this in 2005. This volume comprises the first 18 episodes of the series.  We're introduced to Superman in the 3 part pilot, The Last Son of Krypton.  And we're also introduced to memorable villains like Lex Luthor, Brainiac, and the dreaded Darkseid.  Give this series a chance if you've got a few extra bucks lying around.This is so much better than the Superman movies.  I think it's a great deal more serious, and with a darker Lex Luthor.  I just couldn't take the mad scientist version of him seriously, but Clancy Brown does a wonderful job of voicing and introducing a new take on the character.  Lex doesn't go around throwing kryptonite at Superman every chance he gets like we've seen in the live action films.  He is more suttle in this hit series.  He's a devious and successful businessman who owns half of Metropolis, and he gets away with just about everything.  Great move by the writers.  I'm sure it was done in the comics first,but since I am totally blind, I couldn't tell you anything about that.Another thing I enjoyed about these episodes was the way some of them built on each other.  For instance, we're introduced to a very important villain in an episode called Tools of The Trade which is included in this set.  The writers leave fans who have never read the Superman comics wanting to know more, and they certainly deliver in episodes further down the line.  They also treat Brainiac, who is introduced in the 3 part pilot, in similar fashion.  But like I said, they always deliver.As far as bonus material goes, we're treated to a few episode commentaries and a featurette focusing on the origins of this animated series.  It kept me entertained for hours when I picked this set up in mid 2005.  So if you've never seen this show and aren't wanting to risk purchasing the complete series, try the first 18 episodes.  It's a perfect gift for people of all ages since shows from the DC Animated Universe were designed to please just about everyone.",Superman: The Animated Series - Volume 1
1500123,"As an American who has been living in the UK since February 1999, I was fortunate enough to have grown up in Georgia watching The Three Stooges. And thanks to my DVD collection I still do. Therefore, I lamented the fact that the new film would not be released on the big screen in the UK until Friday, the 17th of August, well after the USA theatrical release date of the 13th of April. However, during a recent vacation in Florida, I was amazed and delighted to be able the buy the new film on DVD during the same week it was released. I still can't believe that I was able to sit and watch the film last night in my living room, along with the deleted/extended scenes and the other extras more than a week before it will be shown here in the UK for the very first time. As for the movie itself, it was well-worth the wait. The three leads are nothing short of marvelous as Larry, Moe and Curly. They so captured the whole essence of the original Three Stooges. The Farrelly Brothers are to be commended for (mostly) keeping the comedy clean and suitable for the whole family. I for one would love to see a sequel, if it was of the quality of this film. As for the delayed UK big-screen release, I don't believe that the comedy of The Three Stooges is very well known enough here to be a success. Much in the same way that a lot of British comedy would not be very widely known in the USA. I do feel that The Three Stooges type of comedy doesn't appeal to everyone, but if you are like me and are a devoted fan, you will not be disappointed in this new film.

I am very happy to see that the DVD is available and I am buying one.I have not seen this since that first time, and it stands out in my mind like I saw it yesterday.  It is one of the most realistic films I have ever seen.  It could have been a documentary.  I lived in NYC for quite a few years and knew some people who were deep into the world of heroin.  I met a couple who had just ""discovered"" it, and as time passed I couldn't relate to them at all anymore, so we drifted apart.  The lifestyle and actions of the couple in ""Panic"" are so close to the couple I knew it is just amazing.  Then of course add Al Pacino's acting, and you have a movie that grabs your attention and keeps it through the entire film.One thing I like about the way the story is told is that I felt the same way about the young couple as I did the couple that had been friends of mine.  I knew that what they were doing was wrong, but I felt sorry for them.

1432834,"I do not own this actual product, as I never could have waited 10 years to own the entire Smallville! I of course have purchased them one per year since 2001. But I wanted to review the series as a whole. And this does look like a really nice set. I saw it in the store, and the books and pictures looked really great. I wanted it! Of course, complete series are kind of pointless unless you become a fan in the last season, or are behind on your wish list. On the bright side, I have the Special Edition of Season 8: the limited edition ""steel"" case from Best Buy!Anyway, SMALLVILLE is pretty much my most favorite TV show ever. (It kind of ties with The Golden Girls, I Love Lucy, and All in the Family, but those are comedies, so you can't really compare.) Never have I spent 10 years - a third of my life - devoted to making sure I saw my show every week! Wow, I can't believe it was that long. Smallville drew me in from Season 1 and never let go. I'd watch it another 10 years, now that he's finally Superman, and has all those new adventures at his doorstep! The finale, incidentally, had to be just about the greatest series finale in all of TV history.I started watching Smallville because I was such a huge fan ofLois & Clark - The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete Seasons 1-4, which had ended 3 or so years earlier. It is so hard to choose whether Dean Cain or Tom Welling makes a better Clark Kent. They are both just amazing. But SMALLVILLE is definitely my favorite show!!Now, I might make some people mad, but to those of you who are complaining that you already own the individual seasons and will not shell out money for a complete set unless they release it on blu-ray: stop being so spoiled. Yes, blu-ray is a very nice picture. But Smallville on DVD is hardly horrible quality, despite being filmed a ""whole decade ago."" It's filmed beautifully, with amazing acting and more special effects than most TV shows, and even a lot of movies. Even the ONE season that is currently as old as a decade is very high quality.",Smallville: The Complete Series

It's so cheesy and campy and so very odd to see the way they dress Peter Framptom at times (ROFL), but I can't help loving it and always will. I showed it to my daughter-in-law for the first time the other day. She loved it too and asked when she got home from work the next day if we could watch it again, so we did. It's a completely bizarre visual experience, but do I dare say that Aerosmith's version of Come Together rivals that of the original (I can see purist Beatles fans getting ready to fling things at me in the streets as I think this lol). Nevertheless it's fun, it's campy, it's cheesy...choose your definition. It always makes me smile and I think Peter Frampton, Aerosmith, etc. did a great job with the covers.

1451732,"Madonna has yet to direct a movie that entertains or enlightens or even just makes you want to see more from her. Granted she's only directed two but without the celebrity status she brings to a picture why would anyone hire her to direct when so many good directors are looking for their next project?W.E. is the story of Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee, and Edward, the next King of England, and their romance. Well for most the story would be about that. Instead Madonna puts a new twist on the story that's been told time and time again. And of course that twist is more lurid than most films choose to use.But rather than just stick with the one story we have another running first and alongside the famous romance. A young woman is trouble with her marriage to her husband and keeps coming back to an auction house selling off pieces of Simpson's past. What a great way to go back and forth in time and allow for some glimpses of newer lingerie.Its been said that the point of this film was less about presenting an historically accurate telling of the same tale once more but more about discussing celebrity and people's desire to have that notoriety. In the way this story is told that seems to be the only thing that interests Wallis Simpson. In an unhappy marriage (on her part at least) she seeks fame and attention. She wants the hoi paloi to take notice of her, to talk about her parties and her friendships. Edward comes off as little more than a party boy who goes from one woman to the next. I could be wrong but I think there was more to their story than that and using them to tell a story completely foreign to their real lives seems a bit much.  Rather than do so why not just use a fictional couple instead? Using historical figures involves viewers bringing with them the baggage of knowing what they know about them already. To try and present them as something else just causes confusion.But that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that the film is completely boring. There are no characters to sympathize with, to care about or to feel involved with. Everyone is self serving and watching them prance about from one party to another is just tedious.One thing will result from this movie. Those who are die hard fans of Madonna will rise to the occasion and defend it as a work of art. They will attack anyone who dares try to say different. Fortunately this is a minority from the look of the box office results for this film as well as DVD sales. With any luck that will mean that Madonna will decide she's better off performing live, recording music or simply acting. Leave directing to those who know how to do it best.",W.E.

The production is really quite well done but I must say that the colorized version adds dimension to the film.  The colorization is excellent, and really adds to the enjoyment of this movie even to the point that it is now one of my favorite versions.  It is dark and dreary, as you expect any movie from this era would be, but this darkness adds to the atmoshpere of the tale.

1121458,"The Beatles, the Vietnam war, star crossed lovers and show-woman Julie Taymor.  That is what `Across the Universe' brings to the table.  It doesn't always work and yet it is never less than intriguing.Using Beatles songs as jump off narratives for plot shifts, Taymor wraps her `Shakespearian' tale around a poor artist from Liverpool who travels to America and falls in love with a girl out of his league and mourning the loss of her beloved (who died in the war).  Together they make an odd pair, born more out of division than unity (their style, taste and political aspirations all stem from separate places) and yet the stars have aligned and shown them the light.  Musically, it doesn't always work.  It seems a little too all over the place and other than Sturgess and the dynamic Dana Fuchs, the vocals don't always deliver the goods.That said, it is a lovely looking film (the art direction is stunning and those costumes are spot on) and it has a central flow that keeps one glued, but it doesn't always make it's point quite how it wants to, and the interwoven storylines (especially concerning Prudence and Sadie) don't add anything to the film...in fact they tend to take away.  Taymor has an issue with overthinking her productions.  She creates truly grandiose looking vehicles (you can add this in with `Titus' as one of the prettiest feature films in recent memory) and yet they are hollow, forgettable almost.  She hasn't figured out how to incorporate her obvious talent for window-dressing into a film that has substance.  Oh, and the special effects here are somewhat atrocious.  She tries to tamper with Baz's insane editing and fast paced musicality with one of the earlier numbers and it comes across messy and childish.It had promise, but overall `Across the Universe' falls flat.",N/A

1510539,"Custer's Last Stand: American ExperienceThis story starts with a telegraph message: Custer and 261 soldiers were killed by the Little Big Horn river, around the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Brigadier General Custer defeated J. E. B. Stuart's ""Invincibles"" at the Battle of Gettysburg to prevent a Union loss. At West Point Custer set a record for the most demerits and finished at the bottom of his class. He showed skill in battle at the head of his troops. After the war Lt. Colonel Custer was sent west to fight Indians (who raided the homes of settlers). It was difficult to find Indians when they avoided combat. The US Army decided to attack the Indians in the winter when they were most vulnerable. Custer was placed in charge of this operation. His victory was praised by the eastern newspapers.The Indian reservation covered most of what is now South Dakota; the Black Hills were considered sacred land. The Sioux received rations in return for their peace. Sitting Bull and his followers kept to their traditional life as buffalo hunters. The Northern Pacific railroad was built north of the reservation. In 1874 Custer and his troops explored the Black Hills to find a location for a new fort. Was there gold? Miners went to the Black Hills to look for gold. Custer testified against President Grant's policies (the corruption in the Indian agencies). The army was ordered to bring in the Lakota Sioux who were off the reservation. The tactic was to use three converging columns of troops to attack the hostile Sioux. Custer was sent to the south of the Indian village. ""No, I will not."" The Sioux and the Cheyenne attacked General Crook's forces using new tactics. They had the largest force of Indians ever assembled.Custer pushed his men towards the Indian camp. Did he underestimate the forces against him? ""We've got them"" was Custer's last recorded words. Reno's command sought refuge on the hill. ""Where is Custer?"" Reno, Benteen, and their forces defended themselves until the Indians withdrew. The following day the other forces arrived to find the bodies of Custer and his soldiers. The news reached America on July 6, 1876. Custer's wife Libbie defended his reputation and memory against those who attacked Custer. Publicity boosted Custer's memory. He was a hero to the American people until corporate publications attacked him in the 1950s. [So who decided this?] I think those closest to the events were the best judges of Custer.This interesting and informative documentary should not prevent you from reading a book, such as Robert M. Utley's ""Cavalier in Buckskin"". The best Hollywood movie is still ""They Died With Their Boots On"" (for drama not history). Was Custer sent into a perilous situation as payback for his testimony to Congress? A loss would damage his reputation.

1478245,"No spoiler here only praisePixar does movies in a special way.  No matter what visually technical movie they want to make they hold the animators at bay until the story is just right.  It is why we followed a fish on a journey to find his son, felt for a robot as it discovered love, and had our hearts strung by a cowboy toy who feels tossed aside like yesterday's news.  I have no idea why I ever doubted that Brave would work as well as past Pixar hits, but I admit I expected it to be nothing more than a money grab movie.  One might come to the thought that this movie was only so Disney could have a red headed princess from Scotland to market to little girls.  I walked into the movie thinking that very thing and was knocked out by how much I enjoyed it.  Regardless of the whether or not this movie was green lighted to fit a toy market, the Pixar touch gave it such strength both visually and emotionally I tossed away my prejudious I had on such thoughts.Although there is humor of easy steriotypes in the movie that makes me feel that Disney had a finger or two in the pie the pace of the movie screamed Pixar.  There never seemed to be a conflict in the movie that was thrown in to only shock and grab your attention.  Every scene was purposeful, and seemlessly flowed into the next.  The artwork was beautiful, and I was pulling for the characters through the movie.  The relationships between the mother and daughter was realistic, yet also shows young girls how to be independent yet respectful.  Too often movies and shows have children who start off snotty rebels, and by the end are still snotty heroes.  It's nice to see a movie where they still show a girl who is independent, yet any snotty actions show real consequence.  By the end you can see the real developement of the hero, and want to root for her.  As a parent I loved how the story was enjoyed by the whole family and my girls left the theatre with a real role model to pretend to be.  The music was beautiful, and celic style made up for any overtly commercial sounding pop theme.  It's not going to be Toy Story, but I felt this movie was well worth the ticket price, and will be added movie to the collection.",N/A
1492209,"This ""Paradise Lost"" trilogy is beyond documentary film making. A better description of the films would be that they are legendary journalistic heroism that are philanthropic education for the American public, in regards to the horrors that CAN arise from the U.S. justice system when it fails.This film was never meant to be the ""final chapter"" of the Berlinger and Sinofsky series on the West Memphis 3 case.  When the film was practically 100% finished, a surprise hearing was called regarding the case. The hearing was prompted by the fact that the original trial judge David Burnett (who was also the judge for EVERY SINGLE APPEAL HEARING regarding this case) denied the WM3 an evidentiary hearing, despite allegations of juror misconduct in the original trial, recantations of testimony used in court, and DNA evidence that excluded the three defendants from the crime scene or the bodies AND pointed in a different direction that the police never investigated.  Burnett's decision caused the defense to go to the Arkansas supreme court to show that Burnett was in error. The defense team succeeded and received an evidentiary hearing for the 3 men in prison, a hearing in which David Burnett was finally NOT going to be the judge that the West Memphis 3 would have to appeal to.  The cops and District Attorney's office knew there would be a retrial, and that the defense would likely win. The unexpected hearing was called four months before the new evidentiary hearing.  If you don't know how it turned out, I won't spoil that part here.  Just know that because of that hearing, ""Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory"" became the final installment that the film making team would ever make.Now, we have the DVD and not only is the film a revelatory piece of brave journalism and a highly entertaining film, it also has good special features.  The bonus material features deleted scenes from the original ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders At Robin Hood Hills"" film, as well as interviews with the West Memphis 3 and the film makers, and previously unreleased footage that is incredibly valuable... most notably, we see the film makers finally address the false testimony of Vicki Hutcheson, who said she went with Damien Echols to a Satanic Esbat / occult meeting, in an attempt to play detective.  The bonus features show her recantation of the testimony (as well as past of the testimony) on video and when it was addressed at the ""new evidence press conference"" in 2007, accompanied by her own statement, presented by attorney Dennis Riordan, which she admits ""Every word was a lie"" and details her drug use at the time of the testimony.  Also, the ""Hollingsworth testimony"" that is alluded to in the first film (but not shown) is included, and shown to be total hogwash.I could talk about this case forever, but I won't. You should watch this entire trilogy, but part 3 is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, and the bonus materials are simply awesome.  Historic documentaries and heroic journalism led to an outcome of compromise, which really satisfied no one more than 50%.  If you know the case, don't hesitate to pick this DVD up and make sure you check out the very valuable special features, which provide further evidence of corruption, incompetence and indifference of the police and the justice system in this case.  A wholly satisfying view, with a great message, along with the ability to teach the American public some things they need to know about cops and courts.The West Memphis 3 Case was a tragic miscarriage of justice, and it's been filmed from the beginning. Everyone should see all 3 films in this trilogy.  A heart-wrenching tale, while showing the strength of the human spirit even in the face of injustice.

However, coming from the trenches, he enjoys no ethics, no code of honor. He steps over the dead, and his flying comrades do not like it.

745530,"""Kiss Me, Kate"" was intended to be performed on the stage, and those who have never had a chance to see it performed as such finally get to see it as its authors intended it to be seen. The songs are quite obviously Cole Porter -- witty, imaginative lyrics bristle with double and even triple meaning, and the melodies stay in your head for days afterward, or, as with ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare"", for weeks.The book seamlessly blends a musical version of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew with a backstage romance or three, managing to stand on its own while doing what it was obviously meant to do (showcase the Porter songs).Brent Barrett is in fine form as Frederick C. Graham, showing off his impressive comedic and (as much as the book allows) dramatic chops. Vocally, he's no Brian Stokes Mitchell, who originated the role in the Broadway revival, but he still possesses a powerful baritone, which he shows off to great effect, particularly in the reprise of ""So In Love"".Rachel York also delivers a sublime performance as Lilli Vanessi. Although her belt isn't as strong as other modern leading ladies like Donna Murphy or Marin Mazzie (who originated the role in the B'way revival), it still packs a mean punch.Despite having two established musical theatre personalities in the starring roles, they are kicked to the back seat whenever Nancy Anderson, as promiscuous yet monogamous ingenue Lois Lane/Bianca, enters the scene. Ms. Anderson chews up the scenery whenever she's on stage, always stopping just short of overdoing it. She brings down the house with her showstopping rendition of ""Always True To You (In My Fashion)"", exuding personality, sensuality, and naive innocence simultaneously. Her performance alone is well-worth the price of the DVD.The remainder of the cast is filled with solid performers, led by Michael Beresse (the sole remaining holdover from the original New York revival) as Ms. Anderson's romantic interest; Nicolas Colicos as the bombastic General Harrison Howell; Nolan Frederick as Paul, Fred Graham's personal dresser; Kaye Brown as Hattie, Lili Vanessi's personal dresser; and Alan Vicary as the stage manager.The sets are well-done, staying mostly realistic with the necessary touches of formalism that the logistics of a stage production demands. Chris Hunt's sure-handed direction stops the production from veering into camp, keeping it at a steady, clipped pace.Lastly, the camera work is thankfully well-done, transferring a production conceived and performed on a theatrical stage to television without robbing the show of its spontaneity. The close-ups and editing techniques that the camera allows actually enhance what was already a critically-acclaimed, Tony-winning show.","Kiss Me, Kate"

457240,"Image Entertainment 1999 ReleaseThis is a very hard movie to rate, as one has to take into account not only the entertainment value, but it's historic value as well. As an entertainment entity, I believe it fails. Scenes between three different tales keep alternating, and it isn't until the end of the movie that one finally realizes how they all tie together. (Jules Verne's books ""20,000 Leagues..."" and ""Mysterious Island"", are both intertwined into the plot of the movie, along with a storyline created just for the film.) Add to that an inordinate amount of time showing underwater shots which, while I'm sure were wonderful in their day, were eclipsed long ago by the likes of Jacques Cousteau, and you have both a confusing, and rather boring film.That said, if one views this movie from an historic perspective, it can be quite enjoyable. After all, this was made in 1916, and was one of the first films to have such underwater photography. The octopus, as an extremely early special effect, would be quite convincing, if it weren't for the readily apparent fake eyes.As for the DVD, the source used was quite good, considering the age of the film. I can't say how it would look on a large monitor, and I'm guessing that it is probably interlaced. However, on my smaller widescreen TV, it looked quite nice. The musical accompaniment was wonderful. It fit both the era of the film, and was scene appropriate.The transfer may have benefitted from windowboxing (to make up for overscan), as some of the intertitles are pretty tight. However, given this is a 1999 release, I think it looks quite good.If you are interested in cinema history, I would recommend this disc.

Add in a ridiculous amount of slow-motion special effects (yeah, the first time, you think ""OK, cool"" but then it happens again... and again... and again...). I couldn't wait for this thing to end. It was disgusting, gratuitously violent, and just plain stupid.

1015415,"Let me preface these remarks by saying I am an avid fan of Japanese movies and culture, having lived there for some years.But I am not sure what movie the ""Editorial Reviewer"" saw, but this movie is in no way ""lyrical"" nor is it ""graceful"" as they write.  Rather the atmosphere is harsh overall.  The ill-directed actors show no acquaintance or even what I would rate as professional sympathy with their assigned characters.  Despite the high reputations of several of the actors, their performances here are perfunctory and wooden.  Now, of course Japanese roles are often seeming much more austere that Western ones, but here the margin is too great for comfort or enjoyment or edification.  The whole product is too cool for its own good: more like a Noh theatre performance of stylized gestures, and shouting taking the place of acting. If you want to see true Japanese families, who show traditional poise and yet operate with what all families must share in terms of care, affection and natural human warmth....look to Ozu's masterworks instead of here (or Naruse or better yet the recent ""Departures"").  I regret to say it, but this is a very disappointing movie.  Not recommended except for the exceptional color cinematography.

Paul's voice sounds a lot stronger in these sessions, and he's clearly enjoying himself, as are the band. Their performance is also much more energetic and loose. I thought the bass player, John Clayton, excelled in particular.The interviews between songs were interesting and delved into the history of Capitol Studios, as well as Paul's love for the material. It really came through in his performance. I'm certain the unedited version on DVD will be even better.

1478220,"Princess Merida of the Dunbroch clan hates tradition, despises it with every fiber of her being. She loves adventuring, riding her horse, and, above all, archery. Her mother always reprimands her for doing unladylike things, which cover just about everything she likes, and instructs her how to be proper and respectful. The lessons culminate when Merida is expected to marry the young man who wins the competition between the three clans in the kingdom. Refusing to conform to convention, Merida decides to compete for her own hand and wins. She and her mother fight, leaving both tearful, frustrated, and angry. Merida rides into the woods and is let to a witch's cottage by wisps. After buying all the witch's wooden wares, she gives Merida a spell to changer her mother which would in turn change her fate. The spell doesn't go as Merida wanted, so she and her mother go in search of the witch to change her mother back to the way she was.I have been looking forward to Brave for a long time and it definitely didn't disappoint me. This is the first Pixar film to feature both a setting in the past and a female protagonist. Both the medieval Scottish setting and Merida serve the film well. The lush greens and wonderful Scottish landscapes are just perfect for this film. They really help in creating the mood of possibility, mystery, and magic. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and seem more realistic than many other recent computer animated films. Merida is a breath of fresh air after so many simpering, weak, boring female protagonists of recent years. Merida is as fiery and wild as her hair. She knows who she is and what she wants in life. Her intelligence and cleverness sometimes get her into trouble, but it's nice to see these qualities revered for once. Even though she rashly makes decisions without thinking them through and hurts some people in the process, I appreciated that this warrior princess erred on the side of impulse. Beneath it all, she truly loved and cared for her family, but didn't really know how to balance their needs with her own. Her endearing personality and the goodness at her core outweighed her carelessness and the ramifications of her impulsive actions on everyone around her.I don't believe this is really a children's film. It's a film that really speaks to mothers and teenage daughters. The conflict between Merida and her mother Elinor that is in the center of this film has no clear side that is right. Merida wants what any teenage girl wants: freedom to be herself and pursue her dreams. An arranged marriage is the last thing she wants. Elinor, on the other hand, has more than herself and her daughter to think about. The fate of the kingdom is in her hands and she must think of the kingdom's safety and wellbeing as well as her family's. Both of these women have valid worries and concerns. If they had spoken to each other rationally, they may have resolved their problems before anyone got transformed, but they are both stubborn and felt they couldn't open up to each other. I think anyone can relate to not being able to communicate with their parents or their teenaged children. Although there is a witch that can be blamed on the surface for Merida and Elinor's predicament, the real villain of the piece is really Merida, her rash decisions, and her inability to take responsibility for them. The witch is an easy scapegoat for younger viewers who don't yet understand more complex themes, but she is only in the film for a very short time and isn't particularly malicious. Some of the humor in the film is fairly simple and childish I believe to entertain young children, but the bulk of the film is for a much older crowd.One of the main shining stars of this film for me is the soundtrack. It is phenomenal and is rapidly becoming one of my favorites. I'm not too familiar with Patrick Doyle's body of work besides Thor, but after this I will seek out anything else he does. The soundtrack is incredibly varied and utilizes a variety of instruments from the Scottish culture, such as bagpipes, dulcimers, flutes, a fiddle, and a bodhran. Scottish reels and jigs create excitement and momentum, while a simple lullaby theme featuring quiet dulcimer and solemn fiddle create tenderness and sadness. My favorite is the lullaby theme from the song Noble Maiden Fair sung in Gaelic by Merida and Elinor. When that theme recurs throughout the film, it just pulls on my heart strings and makes me cry. I also loved that 3 featured songs came from the movie: Touch the Sky and Into the Open Air performed by Julie Fowlis, my new favorite Scottish singer, and Learn Me Right by Mumford and Sons. I love all these songs and have been listening to the whole soundtrack on loop since I saw it earlier this week. Another gorgeous song by Julie Fowlis was featured in the trailer for Brave, but wasn't on the soundtrack called Tha Mo Ghaol Air Aird A' Chuain. It's another gorgeous song with Julie Fowlis' pure tones and a simple strings accompaniment and one of two that are actually in Gaelic.In addition to being incredibly entertaining, full of heart, and full of emotion, Brave is a good step forward in fairy tale films. First, it's an original tale with the basic trappings that put the audience at ease. However, the conclusion is much different than most princess stories. ** SPOILERS** At the end of the film, Merida and Elinor come to a compromise and it's agreed by all the the young people will choose their own spouses. Unlike many other fairy tales, there is no real love interest for Merida and she doesn't get married at the end. She is not defined as a character by any romantic relationship. It also lets the audience see an alternative to marriage or having a family as a life choice in general. I found that refreshing in a genre that almost always ends with a marriage and a happily ever after. I loved Brave and consider it one of my favorite Pixar films. It was entertaining to both children and adults and pushed the boundaries of what a fairy tale princess film can be.",N/A

1534900,"the last Sade DVD Sade - Lovers Live got KILLED by this director's hyperactive interventions. It was like going to worship in awe a goddess at the cathedral, but going with Peewee Herman hyperactivated on candy and coffee, with a red bull kicker. I went to watch Sade quietly, watching, and saw VERY little of her, cut away at the most important second to see the back up band doing NOTHING but standing where they were the last time we cut away to them. I went to watch Sade and saw only the briefest of glimpses from a roaming roller coastering unsteadicam. The last one of Sade this director cranked out of her meatgrinder is cinematography by the earlest, most anarchic Marx Brothers flying around the stage causing mayhem in the midst of due solemnity.For Sade is all about restraint, elegance, dignity, understatement, grace, beauty, and requires, and rewards, a stationary camera on her alone filled with her beauty and understated grace, not this pyrotechnic display of the latest technology which leaves one filling like an unwilling participant in the Sun Dance of the Sioux, hung by hooks spinning from the top of the teepee, like an over aged Peter Pan unable to liberate oneself fomr the constant gyrations of the harness swung high above the stage, unable to see, ready for nausea, for motion sickness.I come to watch Sade, not to get car sick.Why should I trust this director again?Like Sade asks in the Lovers Rock cd, Somebody Already Broke My Heart, I've been hurt before, can't go there again.and this set, which includes the Soldier of Love material, skips the BEST cut from that cd, Long Hard Road, and a lot of the great stuff from Lovers Rock as well, The Sweetest Gift, for instance.And where is that most important tune for our times, Feel No Pain.

We should never notice the camera as it focusses on the subject of greatest interest flowingly, peacefully, still. When we see the camera motion it is wrong, and here all we see is the camera motion, swinging us around like a stone on a string.When you notice the cut, the editing is wrong; and we wince each time the cut so quickly grabs us from the star's face to something completely different that we did not pay to see, that we do not want to see, that we are forced to see, swung around at great speed.

296838,"""The Jazz Singer,"" available for the first time on Blu-ray, is often mistakenly referred to as the first movie with sound.  It is the first feature film with completely synchronized dialogue and musical sequences, but much of it is essentially a silent movie.  It stars the biggest pop celebrity of the era -- Al Jolson -- in a tale with considerable similarities to his own life story.  Jolson portrays a would-be entertainer whose show business aspirations conflict with the values of his cantor father (Warner Oland).  Based on a 1925 play, ""The Jazz Singer"" premiered in New York City in October, 1927, in the Vitaphone process, in which a 16-inch disc was synchronized with standard 35-millimeter projection equipment (the industry would eventually change to the sound-on-film process, where a magnetic soundtrack was imprinted on the film alongside the picture).""The Jazz Singer"" was a huge success in the approximately 200 theaters with sound equipment, and within two years, nearly 8,000 theaters were wired for sound. The film features a number of Jolson's trademark songs:  ""Toot-Toot-Tootsie Goodbye,"" ""Dirty Hands, Dirty Face,"" ""My Mammy,"" and a then-new song composed by Irving Berlin, ""Blue Skies.""The three-disc Blu-ray edition contains a full-length documentary feature, ""The Dawn of Sound: How Movies Learned to Talk;"" four hours of Vitaphone shorts featuring George Burns and Gracie Allen, Baby Rose Marie, Blossom Seeley, Elsie Janis, and several other vaudeville performers; vintage cartoons; a 1947 ""Lux Radio Theater"" broadcast starring Al Jolson; and an 88-page book containing behind-the-scenes collector's cards, lobby cards, souvenir program, vintage documents, and a post-premiere telegram from Al Jolson.",N/A

1334790,"Wagner's Lohengrin is perhaps his most overtly 'romantic' opera. Indeed, it is the quintessential 'knight in shining armor/damsel in distress' story. But like its other Wagnerian cousins (and direct relative, Parsifal) there are many layers of meaning at work in Wagner's text. Musically, this is his most brilliantly scored work, full of brassy fanfares and rousing choruses.And in every way, this is an outstanding musical performance. The American born and trained Kent Nagano, Director of the Bavarian State Opera, leads a performance that can stand comparison to any recording I have heard. His cast, many of them home grown favorites, is headed by THE great singer of our time, Jonas Kaufmann, whose voice, technique and temperment are ideally suited to the role of the Swan Knight.Only one tentative attack on a pianissimo high note slightly mars an otherwise unimpeachable live performance, introspective, anguished, and heroic by turns.Anja Harteros, a German-Greek soprano whose star has been rising in recent years, plays Elsa as a visionary at odds with her regimented surroundings. She is fully immersed in the role and perfectly suited to the vocals demands, as well. Wolfgang Koch and Michaela Schuster are well matched as a thuggish Telramund and his blond gun-moll Ortrud. Friedrich is a notoriously ungrateful role, easily descending into stock moustache-twirling villainy and cruelly high in the voice. Koch is more than up to the vocal demands, and is wholly credible as the villain who is also a victim. Schuster, as his wife, is all eye-popping, sneering, malice. If she does not erupt with quite the volcanic force of Christa Ludwig, well, who else does?Christoff Fischesser, one of a bumper crop of young German basses, may seem a bit callow as the warrior-king Henry the Fowler (the one historic figure in the opera, father of the founfer of the Holy Roman Empire), but he sings Heinrich's demanding part with finesse and detail. The King's Herald, here a significant presence in acts one and two, is excellently proclaimed by Evgeny NikitinThe Bavarian State Opera Chorus is the equal of any, i.e. The Met or Vienna, opera chorus in the world, as is the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra.As to the production: To those ""all-rude dank word-sayers"" who decry anything resembling a modernized staging I say ""Shut your mouth and open your mind!"" I know every bar of this opera well, I own scores, both full orchestral and piano reduction, and I speak German fluently. I am also both a trained opera singer and trained in theater production. And I am telling you all that this is one of the most intelligent, well-thought-out modernized productions I have ever seen. Not a single detail is not clearly without meaning in the context the director, Richard Jones, has devised. Yes, perhaps we miss Lohengrin's entrance in gleaming armor. But if we understand him as man living a preternatural life, desperate to find his way to a normal world and fit in, then his appearance in a baggy t-shirt makes perfect sense. If he is not drawn onstage by the swan, he is at least carrying it, and this becomes an allusion to his father, Parsifal's slaying of a swan as an ignorant youth. The building of the house is a metaphor for the building of a Society, and when Lohengrin is betrayed he burns that house, leaving the town a series cots, like a homeless shelter.All aspects of Ultz's designs are similarly integrated: The Brabantian (Bavarian?) costumes gold uniforms yielding to Lohengrin's blue t-shirts; the wedding ceremony  mingling blue and gold sand in a vase; the Herald `broadcasting' from a tall chair to TV screens; even the quote from Wagner (Here, where my delusions find peace, I name Wahnfried, my home) integrate into a thoughtful gloss on Wagners score. To dismiss all regie-theater out of hand is as reactionary and luddite as those forgotten 19th Century critics who declared Wagner's ""Music of the Future"" as an ill-fated aberration.",N/A

Runtime: 142 minutes.""King Arthur"" sheds the legend and theorizes the true story of the British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries, who led the defense of Britain against Germanic invaders (the Saxons) in the early 6th century as the Roman Empire was crumbling.This is Medieval-British Isle flick in the tradition of the three 1995 films ""Braveheart,"" ""Rob Roy"" and ""First Knight,"" as well as 2006's totally underrated ""Tristan and Isolde (Widescreen Edition),"" which I feel is the best of the batch.""King Arthur"" is my second favorite, followed by the underated ""Centurion"" from 2010. ""King Arthur"" is visually gorgeous, shot mainly in Ireland, but also Wales and England. It has a good assortment of actors, including Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, Keira Knightley as Guinevere, Ray Winstone as Bors, Stephen Dillane as Merlin and an outstanding performance by Stellan Skarsgrd as the Saxon villain, Cerdic. Although I'm not a huge fan of Keira she certainly has a striking face, utilized to great effect in this film, and she looks awesome as a blue-painted Pictish warrior (i.e. a ""Woad"").The soundtrack is good and is sometimes reminiscent of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992), but blander and nowhere near as overpowering.The theme here, other than duty and war, is that of finding one's true home and calling. Many of us dream of ""home"" as some far-off place to find in the near or far future, but home may be closer than we think. We just need to be open and open our eyes.

So he made some small lakes on his property with seven springs, as well as other modifications. Later, when his father was visiting, the subject of vacationing came up. His dad confessed that he enjoyed coming to his son's house rather than traveling elsewhere because it was so beautiful and peaceful that it felt like paradise. The minister learned a lesson: You might be sitting on your paradise (or ""home"") and just don't realize it. In short, quit looking for the greener grass somewhere else and simply open your eyes!FINAL WORD: I put off seeing ""King Arthur"" all these years for no particular reason and, after finally viewing it, I must say it's much different than what I expected. I expected another take on the legend like ""First Knight"" or ""Excalibur"" (not that those two films are in any way interchangeable), but ""King Arthur"" is totally different. It's got a unique story, full of savage Medieval action, but it also possesses an undeniable air of beauty and reverence with quite a few epic/dramatic moments.GRADE: B+ or A-",King Arthur

1538442,"I am a fan of both Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson and also a huge mystery fan. I was sad to see Tom leave Murder She Wrote as I always enjoyed the Cabot Cove episodes with Sheriff Tupper, but was happy he got his own show and always enjoyed Father Dowling Mysteries. It is a formula show and some are better written and cast than others, but the two lead characters carried things nicely and it is a good ""cozy"" on a stormy day with a hot cup of tea. With that said, this review will examine the product itself, both the video, audio, special features and packaging, rather than the series itself.When 'Father Dowling Mysteries' was announced for DVD it went straight to my wish list. I now have both Season One and Two and other than the broadcast network that showed them (NBC, then ABC), they both have much in common as far as the product is concerned so much of my review for Season One and Two are interchangeable and identical. It seems the 2nd Season upped the ante with more graphic and bloody violence.  Perhaps the suits at ABC thought the show needed more blood and gore. On a positive side, the writing seems a bit tighter in the 2nd Season with faster pacing and a more realistic sense of menace from the killers. I would be interested to see where Season 3 takes the show and hope it is released soon.This review is somewhat technical so if you are not into that sort of thing, I can give you my verdict here and now! Video Quality is crummy, sound fares much better and the packaging is cheap with non existent special features.Ok, on with the gory details!You get two DVD's with Season One and Three with Season Two. There is not artwork in the discs and they are a thinner variety of media than I would have liked. Also, the cases are bare bones with the dreaded Eco styling which is almost as much air as plastic. Episode names are inside the case and for the most part behind the discs so you need to remove the discs to see what shows are on what disc. El-Cheapo!How about the video quality? IN a word: LOUSY! It is readily apparent that CBS home video used video tape masters for this transfer. I am talking broadcast video tape but what appears to be at least 1 or 2 generations DOWN from the original. To make up for the horrible bad video quality, there has been an abundance of edge enhancement added and that actually works AGAINST itself as it introduces other unwanted video artifacts into the picture. Don't get me wrong. They ARE watchable, but long shorts are blurry, medium shots are ""acceptable"" and close-ups are ""ok"" but NONE of it looks all that great. The colors are fine pretty much and the motion is encoded correctly at least.I am going to make a guess that 'Father Dowling Mysteries' was edited on video tape after principal photography to save both time and money, much like the later years of Murder She Wrote and as such it is cost prohibitive to return to the original negatives as Viacom most likely used an inter-positive made from the film and transferred THAT to tape, the edited the shows causing another drop in generation resolution. ANYWAY, because of all of this, it is unlikely this show will EVER look any better on home video than it does with these transfers, as sad as that may be. Phooey! It was a huge mistake for production companies to edit on tape as far as the future home video market was concerned. Luckily, shows like Columbo fare much better on DVD thanks to being both shot and edited on film. (until the very last few years on ABC)How about the sound? Well, that is the GOOD NEWS about this product. The sound is presented in Dolby Digital stereo and as such you can use your surround receivers decoder to give you Pro Logic Surround which is both convincing and sounds very good actually. Music sounds excellent and dialogue is crisp and clear. It is a real shame the picture quality is so poor and not presented at the same level of quality as the audio.No special features really, just the network teasers which are tacked on to each episode page and touted as a special feature when in fact they are not. No interviews, no commentaries, nothing. Phooey again!Bottom line, if you enjoy this show then you really have no choice but to purchase these sets as they exist now since it is highly unlikely they will EVER see another home video release. I still find them very enjoyable and do not regret my purchase, just be warned the video quality isn't even as good as a good VHS transfer at times. 'Father Dowling Mysteries' deserved more, better video and better packaging but like Rodney Dangerfield, it just got no respect at all!",N/A

294627,"This was one of my favorite movies growing up. This is the movie I watched every day as a kid, maybe at the age of four or five years old. And even though it captivated me with its general suaveness and cool aesthetic, it wasn't until I was an adult that I could truly appreciate this masterpiece of modern cinema. This is John Carpenters best movie, as well as Kurt Russell, although he was great in Death Proof and John Carpenter's The Thing and Escape From New York are amazing as well. This is definitely their best work.Originally pitched and written as a western, this movie shines as an action movie with a decent amount of supernatural elements to make it different than most ordinary action movies. The martial arts fights are exciting and well designed, the creature effects by Richard Edlund are some of his team's best work, and the overall look and feel of this movie is the exact definition of movie magic. Everything from the score and pacing, to the costumes, effects and acting are on point and shine as a work of art. Everything in this movie works at the highest levels. My sense of nostalgia for this movie has not clouded my judgment and opinion of this movie. This movie is one of those rare gems that only exists because the `80's happened. No one would make a movie like this now and no one would have made a movie like this before the 1980's.After nearly 30 years, the effects in this movie still hold up. Mainly because most of the effects were practical and shot on set. Unfortunately Twentieth Century Fox did not know how to market this movie and it did not do well in the theater. Critics didn't quite understand the depth and genius behind the concept (most film critics are dolts and say stupid things like ""that movie was sleek, sexy and stylish""...how many movies can they say that about?) and because of little to no marketing and poor reviews, it didn't do well in the box office. I actually see that as a good thing. Had it done well, they may have made a sequel. Sequels almost always suck...Ghostbusters II! And I personally think cult classics are the best status for a movie to have. Like The Evil Dead, Army Of Darkness, Die Hard, Monster Squad, The Goonies, Re-Animator, and the Big Lebowski are some of the best films ever made. I definitely consider this movie among those and would even put it at the top. This film made me want to create stories and movies for a living, it's my true inspiration and I'm glad it's remained untouched and unmolested by the Hollywood machine.Kurt Russell was great as Snake Plissken in Escape From New York. In Big Trouble In Little China however, he is irreplaceable. Nobody could play Jack Burton better than him. He plays at being a hero and is cocky and arrogant, yet he is the sidekick in this story. Wang Chi  (Dennis Dun) is the true hero of this epic and as his break out roll, he carries this movie with Kurt Russell in an almost Abbott and Costello style duo that makes it seem like he has been starring in movies for decades. David Lo Pan (James Hong) is probably one of the best villains I've ever seen on film. He is menacing, funny and evil, as he should be. Kim Cattrall is sexy and witty as the do good lawyer, Gracie Law. Her and Kurt Russell play very well off each other and their chemistry is reminiscent of Han and Leia.This movie has all the right pieces to make it an enjoyable piece of escapism. Beyond just being action packed, funny and cool, it's one of those movies like Chinatown or A Clockwork Orange that can be dissected and examined because it is just so damn good that it takes many viewings to understand and appreciate its greatness. I have seen this movie well over two hundred times and I never get bored of it. I don't think I ever will. This movie is a benchmark for what movies can be and should be; fun, exciting, with just the right amounts of action and magic. This is a work of art on so many different levels and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It's perfect.On Blu-Ray, this release has carried over all the special features and supplemental material from the special edition DVD release. While there isn't any new features, it's still a lot of extra stuff and there probably isn't much more material out there for this movie since Fox didn't do much with it/for it. The movie itself on Blu-Ray is immaculate. Black levels are deep and never muddy or murky or too black, colors look accurate, there is no real noticeable DNR and film grain is retained albeit, a bit heavy in some scenes. Detail is sharp and although there are some soft edges here and there, this movie has never looked better. Any fan of the film will be pleased with this upgrade. Anyone who hasn't seen this film needs to. It was the `80's, so don't knock it for it's very 1980's score and costumes. Personally I think that adds to the charm of the movie. Ultimately I love this film, If you don't like it, then I don't like you. Jack Burton is a bad ass, and this film is a masterpiece.",N/A

This was a movie I was actually looking forward to mainly because it was a Spielberg movie. I really did end up liking it quite a bit. The movie reminded me of ""Australia"" in the way that it felt like two movies. The first half was the bonding of the boy and his horse and the second an action filled war movie. I really enjoyed that and it made it feel shorter then it was. For those worried about this being like ""In Pursuit Of Honor"" I have to say that there is really no horse abuse in this at all so it's OK to watch this.

1573155,"Werewolves are by far my favorite kind of monsters, and unfortunately there are very few actually good werewolf movies. This is definitely not one of them. Usually when a movie goes straight to video thats usually a pretty good sign that its going to be bad. I gave this movie a chance simply because it had werewolves and I usually give every werewolf movie a shot but, all in all, this movie is just as bad as you probably think its going to be. The story is bad, especially the ending which feels cheesy and teeny-bopper Twilight inspired or something. The acting is bad, and the script is absolutely the worst. You can tell by the cast as they try to deliver their lines that they know their lines are awful and the movie is going to be awful. The CGI werewolf in this movie is also very bad (but that is expected with a straight to video release).So, I would suggest staying away from this movie. If you are looking for a good werewolf movie I would stick with Silver Bullet (in my opinion the best werewolf movie of all time), The Howling, The Wolfman (1941), or The Wolfman (2010).Edit 11/1/12: After seeing the director's cut of The Wolfman (2010) I can now say that is my favorite werewolf movie. It really gave the much needed character development that was missing in the theatrical version.",N/A
1180033,"They say brevity is the soul of wit. Unfortunately this is one of those films that reminds us of that. It also sharpens our appreciation for just how much of the TV show's appeal came from its deft, rapier-like precision. From really tightly written dialogue and spot-on editing.Of course, whenever a half-hour show gets extrapolated into a full length movie, the central issue the creators must struggle with is almost always the same: what works very well in half an hour minus commercial breaks rarely works out so well in a full length movie. The writers must choose between sticking with the tried and tested formula, and so almost inevitably producing mediocrity, or alternatively, taking some very real creative risks with the way they approach and structure the entire piece.In this case...Let's just say they chose not to take those risks.When watching this movie there were times where I really felt as if I were watching a scene from the TV series played out in slow motion. In a typical episode the TV show communicated more in one minute than the film would in ten. There were other times when the film simply dragged, even to the point where it was just plain boring. To be fair, it wasn't all like this. There were times in the film, mainly around the middle, where I genuinely got caught up in the characters, the world they inhabited, and what they were doing. It's just that there were also plenty of times when I didn't. Given that this film came in at over two and a quarter hours, I can't help but feel that it would've benefited from some more proactive editing. It's almost as if, having lived so long under the tyranny of the 22 minute half hour, the writers and editors never developed the ability to impose discipline from within.On the plus side, this film is beautiful simply to look at. And it's impossible for me to say a single bad word about the actors. Or for that matter about the ""behind the scenes"" people who did the props, the sets, and the photography. Everything is immaculately put together. To be perfectly clear, this is not a bad movie. If you look at it simply as something to kill an afternoon while you knock back a few beers (or dare I say, cosmopolitans) then by all means go for it. You're in for an entertaining afternoon. Perhaps the mistake I made was omitting the alcohol. Just be aware that if you go in hoping for something with the wit and depth of the TV series, you are going to be disappointed.Oh, and I personally found the ending a little trite.Not that I'm giving away any spoilers!Theo.",N/A

1540464,"""Nobody Else but You"" is a serio-comic mystery set in the small, snowy French town of Mouthe on the Swiss border. David Rousseau (Jean-Paul Rouve) is an author of pulp detective novels, come to Mouthe for the reading of his uncle's will, which happens to coincide with the discovery of the body of Candice Laucoeur (Sophie Quinton) in the nearby wilderness. Candice was a cheese spokesmodel and television weather girl, which made her a celebrity in Mouthe. Shivering in his hotel room, pestered by his agent to finish the book for which he's contracted, David is struck by this odd story of the apparent suicide of this small town starlet. He decides to investigate. He's discouraged by the local police, until Bruno (Guillaume Gouix), a junior officer who dreams of being a detective in Canada, becomes convinced that Candice's death was not suicide.G&eacute;rald Hustache-Mathieu wrote and directed ""Nobody Else but You"", intertwining lighthearted black humor and predictable small-town melodrama. Jean-Paul Rouve embodies David's affability, low-key determination, and morbid streak with such charm that the audience wants him to pursue this mystery even when it is not obvious that there is any mystery. In a foray into pop culture idolatry that feels like David Lynch, Candice was a troubled, insecure woman whose difficulties were complicated by her belief that she was the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe. That's not as awkward as it sounds, but hearing Candice's thoughts from beyond the grave seemed to me an unnecessary over-the-top touch whose humor falls flat. The first hour of this film is near perfection, but I felt that it loses the balance between melodrama and humor as David approaches the solution.The DVD (First Run Features 2012): The film is in French with English subtitles. The only bonus features are text bios of director G&eacute;rald Hustache-Mathieu and actors Jean-Paul Rouve and Sophie Quinton.",N/A

The DVD picture is god-awful really.I was hoping the Blu-Ray would solve that. Well it doesn't really. While the video is now 16:9, the quality is just still not up to Blu-Ray standards. You know when you've gotten a classic, and they go back to the film and remaster it and it looks awesome on Blu-Ray? Well they didn't do that here. But to be fair it is much, much better than the DVD version.And for a ""30th Anniversary Edition!"" they added 2 things- ""Sing-Along with Annie"" which consists of, you guessed it, the portion of the movie with the song with subtitles. Lame. And the Ultraviolet version.Other than that, you still get the Aileen Quinn look-back from the regular DVD, as well as the laughably terrible ""Hard-Knock Life"" remake by ""Play"".

But meanwhile, Connor's old enemy General Katana [Michael Ironside] from Connor's home planet Zeist [?????] arrives on the earth to kill Connor once and for all. A LOT of Highlander fans will be quick to tell you that this movie was the worst of the series but after viewing Endgame [check my review for that movie], I'm here to tell you now that this movie is NOT anywhere near as bad as the fans will have you believe. Yes, it's true that this movie goes against everything that the first film's plot established being that the immortals are now aliens from the Planet Zeist [didn't Connor come from Scotland in the first film?????] and for the fact that Ramirez [Sean Connery] is somehow back in this sequel despite being beheaded in the original and yes it's true that the story for this movie really doesn't make any sense at all but i found myself being able to sit through this movie all the way until the end and while it's not as fun as the original Highlander, I find this movie watchable in spite of its numerous horrible ideas. The special effects are pretty cheesy in the original version of this movie [i heard they were updated in the two later re-cuts of this movie but i've never seen either of those yet] and the dialogue is often extremely silly but it does boast a few memorably funny moments [like the scene where Ramirez interrupts a Shakespearean play] and it does feature another memorable villain in General Katana [played well by Michael Ironside who along with Connery steals the show in this movie]. For many Highlander fans, The sole thought about the immortals being from another planet is enough to turn people away from watching this movie but luckily for those turned off by the new plot developments of this sequel, there is always the Renegade version for you to watch [and that and the 2004 special edition are the only versions available on DVD and Blu-Ray since the original version has never been released on either format and probably never will be released on DVD or Blu-Ray due to the general hatred for this version of the film]. I am not saying that this is a great film or even a good film but for what it is, It is a watchable albeit silly action/sci-fi film and it's probably best to just view this movie as a standalone chapter in the Highlander saga.

222367,"Based on a novel by William Goldman, and directed by John Schlesinger, Marathon Man (1976) is a superlative thriller loaded with intrigue and deception, featuring a number of high tension action scenes, brutal torture, and a memorable villain with an ice-cold evil soul and a deadly trick up his sleeve.  The terrific story is brought to life by a marvelous cast, headed by Dustin Hoffman, Sir Laurence Oliver, Roy Scheider, William Devane, and Marthe Keller.  Some spoilers follow.The film opens in New York City, with two elderly men being killed in a traffic accident.  This incident triggers a sequence of events that brings a former Nazi named Christian Szell (Oliver) out of hiding in Uruguay.  A government agent named ""Doc"" Levy (Roy Scheider) is on his trail, looking to get his hands on a fortune in diamonds, that Szell has stashed in a safety deposit box in a New York bank.Thomas Babbington ""Babe"" Levy (Hoffman), Doc's kid brother, is a student at Columbia and a runner training for his first marathon.  Babe has recently begun a romance with a woman named Elsa (Keller), whom he met in a library.  The runner is suddenly drawn into a situation he has no knowledge of, when after being stabbed by Szell, a wounded Doc collapses at Babe's apartment and dies on the floor.A man named Janeway (Devane) arrives, claiming to work for a top secret branch of the government.  He informs Levy that his brother was also a government agent.  Janeway's prediction that Babe is in danger is correct, as he is abducted that night by Szell's henchmen, and taken to meet the former Auschwitz dentist, who asks the iconic question ""is it safe"", as probes and drills Levy's teeth.  Szell is eventually convinced that Levy knows nothing about his plans, and orders him killed, however Levy manages to escape, and must somehow find a way out of the situation.Marathon Man is not without flaws, but once matters reach a critical mass, events move so quickly, that there isn't much time to question what is happening.  After his escape, Levy doesn't contact the police.  Instead, when things finally calm down, he finds himself at a house in the country.  It's a strange detour that doesn't quite fit, as Levy has absolutely nothing to bargain with.In the city, Szell is visiting jewelry shops, looking for information about diamonds.  This doesn't seem to make that much sense either, however it sets the stage for ghosts from Szell's past to return, as he is recognized by some former death camp inmates.  The scenes are eerily effective, as Szell frantically scrambles to escape his past.Laurence Olivier's performance is magnificent, earning him a well deserved Oscar nomination.  At 69 and not in the best of health, there appeared to be physical limitations on what Olivier could do, yet the final confrontation scene with Levy in a pump station, is still quite dramatic and memorable.  Dustin Hoffman (The Graduate,Straw Dogs,Kramer vs. Kramer) is also outstanding, playing a man who has survived a trip to hell, sucking his teeth in pain as a reminder of the ordeal.  Although 39, the youthful looking Hoffman passes for a college student at the start of the film, however at the end, having been through the grinder, Hoffman very much looks his age.Roy Scheider (Jaws, The Seven Ups), and William Devane are also excellent.  Accomplished Swiss actress Marthe Keller, who did not speak English when she got the part, gives a remarkable performance in her American film debut.  She would soon become somewhat typecast, appearing in a string of thrillers includingBlack Sunday(1977),The Formula(1980), andThe Amateur(1981).The Nazi element was a popular theme in thrillers during the 1970's, and free of any political ties, it fits perfectly here, as it seems quite possible that a person like Szell could exist.  Most of the remaining story seems credible, and although there are some unknowns, matters come together pretty well, in what is one of the best thrillers of the decade.  The DVD contains some nice extras, including a relatively recent retrospective featurette.",N/A

447345,"For the Blu ray it earns 5 stars and I received the package very quickly. But the information given by Amazon is not so correct. As I live in Holland I always look if a movie has english subtitles. I also did with this one and it said that it had only spanish subtitles. Because I was misinformed by Amazon before, I looked at ""Beaver com"" a very reliable source. And there was mentioned it had english subtitles. Besides that, Universal most of the time indeed does have english subtitles, so I mailed to Amazon if someone could look at the back of the Blu ray to see if it had english subtitles after all. The answer I got was ""if it is not mentioned on our site you must wait for the next release of this item, perhaps that will have subtitles"". Not very satisfying, I immediately answered that I was not satisfied and why they didn't take the little trouble to look at the Blu raywhat was correct. No more answer. So I decided to rely on ""Beaver"" and take the gamble, and that was correct, it had english subtitles. Then I complained at Amazon again and they said how I could change the information on their site when it was not correct. The world upside down.

1034394,"Addio Zio Tom (Goodbye Uncle Tom) is one of the most controversial and possible racist movies that I've ever seen. Directed by Jacopetti and Prosperi it attempts to compare the history of slavery in America to the rise of the Black Power movement of the early 1970'sAddio Zio Tom is a pseudo-documentary in which the filmmakers go back in time and visit antebellum America, using period documents to examine, in graphic detail, the racist ideology and degrading conditions faced by Africans under slavery. Because of the use of published documents and materials from the public record, with actors playing the role of the historical figures, the film labels itself a documentary, and portrays slave life as a non-stop orgy of violence, rape and torture committed by Whites against their Black slaves.The film is presented by Blue Underground in two versions: an English language version which removes much of the political subtext in favor of more scenes of violence and an Italian Director's cut which adds several modern day scenes of the race violence of the Civil Rights Movement.The Diorector's Cut was never publically seen until it was reedited by Jacopetti for the DVD. The film is quite startling and disturbing to watch. It is presented as a sort of time travel piece in which two Italian journalists travel back in time to witness the horrors of slavery. We are taken from the slave ship on the long journey to the slave market before being taken onto the plantation and into the later slave breeding operations.The film tries to show how the institution of slavery led to the black mindset that led to the black on white violence of the Black Power Movement. The film ends with a modern day reconstruction of the Confessions of Nat Turner. Surprisingly the Director's Cut works quite well as compared to the ultraviolent English version. It's not pleasant watching but it does represent a European perspective on American race relations.The English Version of the film features the original 8mm behind the scenes footage of production designer Giampaolo Lomi with commentary that offers quite a bit of information on shooting the film in Haiti. There are no special features on the Director's cut.",N/A
1390526,"Brent is a teen suffering emotional scars from the death of his father from 6 months earlier. School is almost over and the 'End Of School Dance' approaches. But, Brent's life is about to go from one horror to another as he is targeted by the deranged Lola and her equally deranged father for a prom night of torment and torture. But, is torturing a tortured soul a good idea? What separates this from the recent torture porn sub-genre is that writer/director Sean Byrne crafts his horror with emotional depth and with some nicely and subtly intertwined story elements that I won't spoil here. His script is both straight to the point and subtle at the same time and not without some dark humor weaved in between the horror elements and the gruesome moments. He also fills the film with some very effectively designed shots to accent the intense and vicious goings on. There isn't a bad shot in the movie and the film looks great. Even the soundtrack is like another character in the film as the songs and music are very deliberately selected and placed for added emotional resonance. His cast members are all on target from Xavier Samuel as Brent, a wounded and guilt ridden teen who cuts himself but, suddenly discovers a will to survive when someone else is doing the cutting. Robin McLeavy gives a tour de force performance as the deranged Lola making her menacing but, not without letting a cuteness and sexiness through which makes her even more disturbing as she torments her 'date'. She gives her character a fiendish quality and never goes over the top enough for the character to become campy. She remains menacing even when going full tilt psycho for the chilling final act. John Brumpton is her equally disturbed father who will do anything to make his princess happy and his character is given just enough restraint to never upstage the rotten fruit of his deranged loins, Lola. The supporting cast all perform their roles with some nice emotional depth too, making everyone seem important to the story even before Byrne subtly lets us know why. A terrific, clever and fiendishly entertaining Aussie horror film and a very impressive debut from Sean Byrne.",N/A

255268,"Taking place mostly indoors in an asylum, this late 80s film is one my favorite zombie films.  The simplistic plot involves a deceased mad doctor being reanimated by an earthquake.  With his horde of zombies, he kills and conducts experiments on the inmates at the asylum.  Unlike other zombie films, the zombies simply tear open peoples heads and pull out and fondle there brains.  There's a little bit of topless nudity, and Cheryl Lawson ( who's the main actress) looks great.  There's plenty of gore and violence, although some of the violence is off screen.  One scene worth mentioning involves a gruesome scene where the doctor is piercing an exposed brain with needles.  The zombies look great, and the mad zombie doctor is particularly menacing.  The directing and acting are good, and the pace is pretty fast; although some people might think it's a little slow in parts.  It's also a very well scored film, and I personally think it has excellent replay value. However, It should be noted that I'm a big fan of 70s and 80s zombie films, so some people may not like it as much as me.The DVD quality is very good, but it isn't as good as some of Code Red's later releases.  The color, contrast, and sharpness look fine.",N/A
689993,"this movie is truly amazing. a man trapped in a dream. filmed in real life and then covered in cartoons (rotoscoping) by different artists for sections of the movie. the plot is chilling and intriguing, the music is hauntingly beautiful, and then there's the ""talks""...this is what all the one star reviewers are talking about. everyone loves the animation, no one notices the plot, they all HATE the talks.they are sections of the film where the main character meets different people and listens to them talk about quantum physics, dreaming, philosophy, and so on. it's not normal film style, it's almost like it switches from a normal plot based film to a documentary on philosophy and then back to the plot and so on.for me this was absolutely amazing. i learned so many new things! it sparked an interest in quantum mechanics, i got interested in and learned to lucid dream after the movie inspired me to buy a book on the topic, it made me think deeply about reality, and so on. but that's how my mind works, i love new ideas and reality questioning philosophy.if you look closely you will see that most of the negative reviews fall into two classes with some blending:1. people who sound like they are over educated. they keep mentioning college and philosophy classes and the like. these people probably already knew most of the info in the movie, so for them it was just boring and nothing new. since the plot goes ""documentary"" at these parts it would be like a history buff trying to enjoy the abraham lincoln movie and suddenly the movie just goes from the story driven theatrical experience to some guy telling a story about lincoln that is exactly something the history buff has read in a book already. the plot stops and it's suddenly info they already know presented in a non story driven manner. so they get bored. i think if these people had not taken all the courses and read all the books they had it would have come across much better for them.2. people who just cannot stand documentary style talks period. some of these may simply not like these kinds of talks at all, others may like documentaries but just not on philosophy and what not. this cannot be helped. this is not a normal constant flow from beginning to end kind of movie. there is a definite progression of the plot from beginning to end but it takes little detours for deep informational talks.and of course there's people who don't like it for a combination of these two reasons.so as long as you're not over educated on dreaming, philosophy, the mind, reality, and quantum physics and you don't hate documentary style talks interspersed with a VERY interesting plot, you will love this movie.or if you are over educated but still relaxed and interested in hearing things like that even if it's not all new to you, you may just still enjoy it. if you hate documentary style things though you will probably not enjoy this film.",N/A

901696,"Overall this is a pretty good movie, though it is a rather dark and dramatic tale.This movie is based on a book, written by the girl who lived through this to find herself. I have not read the book so I can't compare it.This would not be a good date movie or family movie, too much drama and adult content.The story follows a troubled girl, a writer, just as she finishes high and moves away to college. And while she seems to have all the opportunities in the world, she also has a lot of personal issues, not the least of which is a broken home and self hatred. Of course college doesn't ""make her all better"" and she begins a downward spiral and ends up going into therapy, and eventually put on perscription medication. She loves and looses friends and relationships along the way, as well as her ability to write. Interesting story.The acting was great, very dramaticly intense scences that made you feel for the girl. The story was a little slow in areas (not sure how the book faired with this), and some very odd directing in areas as well (that could either be enriching or distracting depending on your tastes).I think I would buy this movie for my collection, though I doubt I would watch it a lot.",Prozac Nation

1551039,"Michael Biehn what the hell happened to your career?  I mean, seriously, bro, you were in Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Tombstone, even The Seventh Sign, and now this?  Dude, if you're hoping for a Mickey Rourke comeback, doing D-level dreck like this is not the way to go.I should've known I was in serious trouble by the cheap looking title sequence as well as seeing Biehn's name listed four times.  Did you miss a credit?  Like, maybe scoring or make up or key grip?  But I'm a sucker for punishment, I guess so I went with it.  At $5, I might have just covered this movie's whole production value.So we have these two easy girls Annie (Jennifer Blanc-Biehn, yup the ultimate couch test: marrying the director) and Mary (Danielle Harris, Halloween, Urban Legend) who are out ""partying"" (ie: smoking dope and having sex) in the woods with two cops.  But when Mary is accidentally killed during sex, our two hot blooded lotharios scramble to coverup the crime and eliminating the only witness, Annie.  But Annie overhears this plan and makes good her escape.  She ends up at a lone cabin in the woods where Kyle (Biehn) is shunning the rest of the civilized world.  And this is where the fun is suppose to begin if this movie wasn't as bad as it was.Faults are plenty here.  The biggest one is casting.  Seriously, I don't know what strip club Biehn met Jennifer Blanc in but putting her in the leading roll was a travesty on your part.  She is no Sherry Moon.  This girl can't act; plain and simple.  At one point, she is lying on the floor of the cabin, sobbing as if somebody had just made her Sophie's Choice her children, yet when we see her face as she is wailing, not a single tear.  Not even her eyeliner is running.  Strike One.Which leads to character development.  First off, there is none.  All the main rolls here are as flat as the roads in Kanas.  And we all know that movies of this sort requires characters we are suppose to care for and would like to see come out stronger in the end.  They don't exist here.  Annie and Mary willingly put themselves in the situation.  And while Annie has just met one of the guys, this doesn't stop her from going down on this guy while Mary is having her thin, brittle little neck snapped.  Now, I'm no prude but how much can you like a character who does this?  Yes, I know that there are people like this out there in the world but that is why we usually find their stories being told on The First 48.  People rarely bat an eye when they go missing or turn up dead.  And Annie even winds up in Kyle's bed moments after coming back from trying to find Marry's body.  You would think that she would've learned her lesson but nope, not her.  Strike Two.The last straw here is the whole third act and the so called twist ending.  While violent as it is, since you haven't invested any personality into the characters, you really don't care that they are killed so there really is no payoff.  And the twist can be seen coming a mile away.  All in all, an epic fail.  Biehn, I hope you find your career again or, at least, a noble retirement.  Associating yourself with this so called Revitalized Grindhouse Filmmaking (as in, cheap movies with no redeeming reason to be made or seen by the masses) is not the way you want to go.  Avoid this or only watch it if you feel like you've done something so horrible that self torture is the only way to punish yourself.",N/A

1339927,"This is a remake of a foreign film called Let the Right One In. I honestly think that the original was a bit scarier. This film isn't as dark and scary as the older one. It is a very good movie though.This film is about a boy that gets picked on a lot at school. Life is very hard for him, and he feels lonely much of the time. One day he befriends a girl living in a nearby apartment. She keeps him company, and gives him confidence. She also puts an end to the bullying he is suffering from. There is something not right about this girl. He learns that she is a vampire. Her secret shocks him, but he wants to stay with her regardless.This is a pretty cute love story about two children. It also has a heavy helping of violence and darkness. I really enjoyed it. It does have a depressing vibe about it, but it's a different take on the vampire theme. It explores the love between a vampire girl and a human boy. They want to be together forever, but he will grow old while she remains a young girl forever. It's kind of sad.

1226981,"This ""Lord of the rings"" rip-off by mockbuster master The Asylum is a lot better than it deserves to be.Unlikely named actor Daniel Bonjour, obviously cast because he looks a lot like Frodo, plays Arkadi, a youthful adventurer who must collect a number of jewels which, when placed into an amulet that looks like it was bought at Claire's Boutique for $10.95, will for unexplained reasons give him the power to save the world from the evil of a wizard named Kirill, played by Not Ron Perlman, and his CGI dragon.He's aided in his quest by two warriors: Katya, whose porn star makeup and lip gloss perfectly match her porn star acting talents, and Maxim, played by ungracefully aging Marc ""Beastmaster"" Singer, whom the director unwisely required to act like the child of an unholy union between Yoda and Popeye.Between the opening scenes of Not Frodo peeping at a hottie villager taking her clothes off for no good reason (Note: You don't even get a peek; don't even bother pausing or backtracking the DVD like I did) and the anticlimactic final battle between Not Frodo and Not Ron Perlman, there's in fact a charming little fantasy story going on, with some pretty location shooting and nice b-roll over mountain vistas and lush forests.The dragons are actually pretty neat looking, even though all they really do is fly around and shake their heads back and forth. And the scene with the Giant Spider Which Does Nothing is worth the Netflix order alone.All in all, ""Dragonquest"" comes off as a bunch of renfaire friends who got together and made their own fantasy movie, with some bargain basement CGI spliced in. On that level, it's a pleasant enough bit of fun.Don't buy this one for full price; that would just be foolish. But I've seen it here on Amazon for about three bucks new, paired on the same DVD with the equally workmanlike Asylum effort ""Merlin: War of the Dragons."" That's how to buy your bad movies, folks.

They plan the wedding; they have the wedding; but Lois is a frog-eating clone; Lois loses her memory; Lex is resurrected; Wanda Detroit (Lois) falls for Lex, then Lex is gone again; Lois regains most of here memory but falls in love with her unscrupulous therapist.Things are finally straightened out, but just when they are talking wedding/elopement, the season ends when two surviving (of a thousand) Kryptonians telling Kal-el that he was married at birth to Zara and he MUST go to the rocky red-sunned (no super powers) planet to run the place or civil war will break out.Most of the episodes are pretty good, but the ""will they? won't they?"" gets a bit tedious sometimes. Makes you want to shout at the TV, ""Just let them get married for crying out loud!"" But that is reserved for Season Four.Obviously there are stand-alone episodes that have nothing to do with their non-marital problems. And there are some pretty colorful bad guys to contend with.The other characters (Martha, Jonathan, Perry, and Jimmy) are just as entertaining as in seasons one and two (a new Jimmy Olsen came on board in S2, but he's still pretty good).Was it a perfect season? No.Is it entertaining? Mostly.Should you buy this third season DVD set? Definitely, if you are following ""The New Adventures of Superman.""Will I buy Season Four? Of course.",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 3

1311780,"I remember the original television series and maybe that dates my age but I was truly hoping that this would be a worthwhile movie. BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED ! ! !The issue here is; Seth Rogan and the movie plot. Obviously Seth Rogan either never saw the original series, or he just likes to pervert a Classic.Jay Chou has presence and is a decent actor. He Steals the show but other than that, the fat arrogant "" Bitch-Boy "" Seth Rogan totally ruins the movie. Jay Chou has class and should never act again with the immature little boy Seth. Jay Chou isn't Bruce Lee but he'll do in a pinch.I remember the original actors as having a lot of class and they never, never, ever had arguments or fought with each other, nor did the Green Hornet ever talk down to Kato as Seth Rogan does numerous times in this movie, to Jay Chou, the Kato character in this movie.For those of you who have never seen the series, there is a fairly new T.V. channel that shows old classics, "" MeTV "" and they are currently showing "" The Green Hornet "" on Saturday Mornings.  If you want to watch a great classic from that time period, I recommend you watch it. You will enjoy it. Maybe Seth Rogan should watch it to learn something about  "" Class, Style and Great Acting "". Besides, if he had ever talked to Bruce Lee the way he does in his move, Bruce Lee would have handed him his head and his Lunch.Seth Rogan is an immature little punk and has been since the first movie he ever appeared in. He figuratively SUCKS the life-blood out of this movie through his actions, his attitude and lack of acting skill.I didn't purchase this movie through Amazon but no matter, I feel like I was royally screwed on the price of this movie. I don't want others to have to waste a $ 20.00 bill, especially during these hard financial times.  It is not even worth giving it away for free, which is what I am going to do. THAT my friends, is what I think about this movie.There are other good actors in this movie who wasted their time and acting skills to produce this rubbish. Maybe they needed money but I am sure there were other movies they could have worked in. With all the trash and rubbish that currently comes out of "" Holly-Weird "" these days, there doesn't seem to be any shortages, especially since they like to make so many re-makes, of re-makes, of remakes.Seth Rogan should give up as an actor, he has NO CLASS or Acting Skill what so ever. He is a big fat baby who needs a pacifier shoved into his mouth.Don't waste your money! Setting fire to a twenty dollar bill would make more sense.This movie is a B-I-G  L-O-S-E-R  ! ! ! ... like Seth Rogan. Hey Seth ... Your Diaper needs changing !",N/A

Even though the plot was about house slaves in the 60's, it actually brings up interesting subjects about snobby upper-class women that some people are for some reason afraid to acknowledge like how some of them shouldn't be having kids and such. Anyway, the story and characters were intriguing enough to make male viewers interested like myself. (I saw this without any females present!)

230535,"I was a teen during the 80s and remember watching tons of horror films during that time which also converted me into a lifelong fan of the genre. I admit horror and slasher flicks made during the 80s tend to be cheesy and overly exaggerated, and let's not forget the annoying soundtracks.I was browsing through Youtube to watch ""The Attic"", another strangely fascinating gem from the 70s when I chanced upon The Unseen. It looked vaguely familiar so I might have actually watched this back then but can't seem to recall details. Anyway, the basic premise is three young women are in a small town in California where two of the women are a news crew covering the Dutch festival. The trio can't find anyplace to spend the night as all the local motels are fully booked. They end up at an old hotel and are greeted by a middle-aged man who appears charming and solicitous. He tells them the hotel is now a museum but after watching the distress on their faces, offers to put them up at his own home.The benign museum curator, Ernest Keller (played impeccably by Sydney Lassick) turns out to harbor sinister motives and is shown to have perverse tendencies. Also, his wife Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) is visibly upset when the three young ladies show up at the house, and viewers discover why soon after. There is an unspeakable presence in the house, one which is not seen (hence the title The Unseen) and all three young ladies become acquainted with the Unseen soon enough.As predictable as the storyline is, there are some highlights which made this an interesting watch for me. The production qualities were actually quite good for its time and the performances by the cast was above average for what I presume was a low budget flick. Especially riveting were the performances by Lassick as the lecherous pervert Keller and Stephen Furst as the Unseen. Goldoni's performance as the tortured soul Virginia was finely nuanced and credibly portrayed. As for the three girls - there's ex-Bond girl Barbara Bach playing a reporter. There's full female nudity in one scene. Not much character development here not that there's time. The movie has its creepy moments, especially when Lassick and Furst are in the frame.

The story itself is just silly, I really can't think of a better word to describe it.  The most ridiculous plot hole, and one of the worst plot holes I've ever seen, is the fact that every character that comes along and is told about this crazy story unfolding at their apartment complex just believes it, don't question it in anyway, and just go along with this silly fairytale as if they live in lala land and it's all perfectly normal.

1163636,"I bet you cannot watch this movie without asking yourself, ""How much of this is true?"" Not just what's verified and what is speculation, but how accurate do you suppose the guesses are? It's very spooky, this movie. Holding a mirror up to what we have just lived through, and at a time when we did not yet know whether Obama would win and change things, or McCain would win and continue the basic plan.For one thing, most of the people who play well-known figures look quite like their roles, even Richard Dreyfuss as Darth Cheney. In fact, Josh Brolin as W. and James Cromwell as H.W. are the only two who are not particularly look-alikes, in that both actors are rather more lean and angular than the presidents were. Thandie Newton is positively spooky as Condi Rice. Toby Jones is a little smaller than Karl Rove, but just as slimy. Jeffrey Wright does not at first look all that much like Colin Powell, but he grows into the role -- or his makeup does.The early part of W's life is the only part we have not seen before, although we certainly heard about it. We see his fraternity initiation, but not his Skull and Bones one. We see him chatting up a Texas gal and persuading her that he's going to marry her, and then later hear that his father had to ""take care of her"" when she came up pregnant. He's in jail for reckless driving, and his father bails him out. But in his job in the oil fields, his try at Wall Street, and especially his lack of focus more generally, H.W. is deeply disappointed, and says so. In real life and in W.'s nightmares.We are also ""treated"" to his drying-out from alcohol, his born-again experience, his belief that God was calling him to run for president. Still, there seems to be more of the whiff of brimstone than the odor of sanctity about the man, especially ending every cabinet meeting with a silent prayer. If it was not phony, I almost wish it had been.The decision to invade Iraq, the Cheney power hunger, the way everyone in that cabinet room could go along with Cheney's plan to take over the entire middle east by surrounding and then conquering Iran; it's all so spooky that I simply cannot help asking myself: how much of this is the truth?It's a well-made movie about a very unsettling topic, and I would have preferred if the two men who portrayed the Bush presidents looked a little more like the real Bushes. Can't have everything. I would also have like more about some topics and less about others, but on the whole, the story hangs together as the biography of a man who never should have been elected to any office, let alone the presidency.",W

Each of his releases were met with frenzy and box office success. Rajneekanth from the south, aslo creates the same excitement but I have heard not expereicned it. In recent years, Salman Khan creates rabid fans and rewrites box office collections with each subsequent film. his streak started with Wanted, and was followed by Dabanng, Ready, Bodyguard. As I write this Ek Tha Tiger has become the second highest grosser in the history of Indian Cinema.Ek Tha Tiger is about Tiger( Salman Khan), a spy for the RAW unit of Indian Itelligence. his boss gives him an assignment to trail an Indian scientst at the Trinity College in Dublin, who is also being pursued by the ISI for his work on Nuclear research. In Dublin, Tiger meets a music student who is a parttime housekeeper ( Katrina Kaif)at the professors house.He falls in love and Tiger turns in to a pussy cat.The film is engaging and has a engaging first half, however the pace slackens a bit when the leads fall in love. The action and the plot takes tiger all over the world from Iraq, Turkey, Dublin and Cuba and that makes the film fun to watch.The direction is adequate and so are the action scenes. Music is very,very mediocre.Salman Khan kicks major booty and Katrina and him share a lot of chemistry.I enjoyed the film ( not plot wise but for the the experience of watching it in a crowded movie theater whilst experiencing the Salman hysteria) but still fail to understand the unprecedented euphoria accompanying the film. As I exited the theater, I overheard a conversation between two men. Did you enjoy the film? said one of the men. The other man replied "" The movie was average but I just came to see my brother Salman and sister in law, Katrina"" That probably sums up his Salmans popularity in his legion of fans..

They also have two shorts to rip to shreds, Magical Disappearing Money which is about some drunk aunt as a witch in bad make-up trying to help people in the '70's save money on food rather than throw it away on more expensive and better food items. This one is gold for the guys as they just have a blast with the material especially making fun of the blank expressions on the actors faces and the ""witch"".The second short sees comedian Paul F. Tompkins join the guys and its called ""Paper & I"", where a young boy has a seemingly beyond creepy attachment to a brown paper bag, so this bag comes to life at night and takes him to forests in the south, then to a paper mill all in an attempt to show him how paper is made. Also much like MST3K's ""A Case of Spring Fever"" the bag shows him what life would be like without paper. This is the funnier of the two shorts as its so badly acted and creepy that the guys just have a great old time with it.The main feature is the movie which isn't a horrible film, but the acting is a bit stale and the laughable scares do make for good riffing. The guys have fun with a lot of the wholes in the movie and mainly target Lance, the test pilot who keeps falling over his own feet and hurting himself and Nora the plain jane who is so scared yet seems to just keep looking for ways to be more scared.Like other Rifftrax live dvds the audience being there to laugh at the jokes does give it a cool feel unlike the standard yet hilarious Rifftrax dvds.

When the Peacekeeper Wars came out, everything was up-tempo; the action, the interaction between the characters, the colors, the CGI, everything. It was so much better. However, as with any tragic drama, somebody had to die. Everybody I know who is familiar with the show never saw the death of D'Argo coming.

There are so many story lines and back stories that could've kept it going for at least another 5-7 years.I find myself asking that about a lot of science fiction shows that are really, really, good: why did this series end?

138767,"""West Side Story"" is among the greatest-ever movie musicals, glorious winner of the 1961 Best Picture Oscar and nine other Academy Awards.  (My other top 5 musicals, all named Best Picture, are: ""My Fair Lady"", ""Gigi"", ""Chicago"", and ""The Sound of Music"".)In this 50th Anniversary ""West Side Story"" Blu-ray Edition, both sound and picture are marvelous.  Unfortunately a pair of Blu-rays left audio and video out of synchronization.  Audio was just enough ahead of video to become terribly distracting, certainly for me, a super fan of ""West Side Story"".I'm thankful for ideas below I tried, helping me find a solution.  They suggested a fix tailored to my own equipment, rather than blaming the Blu-ray.  The leading suspect thus became ""7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio"".  It was the ""West Side Story"" Blu-ray default audio setting, an advance way beyond the capacity of my 20-year old analog receiver/pair of great speakers to handle properly.  And I routinely ignored audio settings for movies, such as variations upon Dolby Digital 5.1.  Did not seem to matter, until ""West Side Story"".With concert DVDs, always in synchronization, I tried to choose whatever audio option sounded best.  That usually turned out to be something like Dolby 2.0, a simple, outdated, surround sound choice for my analog receiver and two speakers.  (The endless variety of audio choices under DVD/Blu-ray ""setup"" still confuse me.)""West Side Story"" offered ""4.0 Dolby Digital"", an alternative to ""7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio"", the default.  Changing that audio setting to ""4.0 Dolby Digital"", together with unplugging/re-plugging, and multiple acts of turning the Blu-ray player off then on, ACTUALLY WORKED.I will neither argue with success, nor conduct any further experiments.

You remember him right, the cold, calculating mystery man who could appreciate the ""artisty"" of another killers works? This is a return to that while still that the character has evolved emotionally. Okay to explain my love of season six I have to explain what I feel were the failures of seasons 3,4 and somewhat 5. I liked season 2 a lot.  It was a bit taudry, soap opera like but the stuff with Doakes was priceless and kept my attention all the way through and Lila did make a pretty good foil, and it was fun to have Dexter leaning the pleasures of sex. By season three everyone seems to agree was the weakest, a fairly weak villain in Jimmy Schmidt and that skinner killer that was just boring as all get out with what had to be the worst final episode execution by Dexter, it's like the writers over did it with filler and forgot they had a season to wrap up. Then season four which I must admit left me cold, I never gave a crap about Dexter as a family man so the Lithgow plot didn't do it for me and Rita just seemed to prove to be more of an obstical for the Dexter I fell for in season one rather than his guiding light. Then you have season five which had its high points but was dragged down by the Dexter step daughter plotline, the LaGuerta/Batista plotline that went nowhere and served only to pad the story out to 13 episodes.Now you have season six, Dexter's a free man, no one to get in his way, no one (Rita) to explain himself to. We see he's an emotinal indivisual without the scenes being over the top, he loves his son, it's more than obvious and it's the most rewarding (for me) relationship Dexter's had. The religious overtones work perfectly for me, althoug I'm not religious I find faith an interesting subject, I found Brother Sam one of the best characters to be introduced in the Dexter series. This is the first time since the Ice Truck killer that I actually found the big baddie of any interest. Finally, the cops aren't continously on Dexter's arse, that got old around season three. Plus the inner monologue's as sharp as it's been since season one, whereas for atleast the last three seasons Dex's inner thoughts were a bland as a boiled potato. Everything's been sharpened up, the characters (old and new), the cases, the subplots and overall moodiness of the series.

16718,"For such a successful musical with a score by Richard Rodgers (music) and Lorenz Hart (lyrics), it's a bit surprising that it took seventeen years before Columbia Pictures brought it to the screen. But the wait was worthwhile. Our eponymous hero, if we can call him that, was played by Frank Sinatra (Gene Kelly in the 1940 Broadway show). He is a shallow, down-and-out, womanizing hoofer but, for all that, radiates charm and wit. In the movie, he has to choose between two gorgeous ladies - Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. Tough choice! Novak is a timid girl from the chorus line while Hayworth is a former stripper who has pretentions of being a society lady.The film score has many tunes that have become popular standards: `Bewitched', `My funny valentine', `I didn't know what time it was', `I could write a book', `There's a small hotel', and `The lady is a tramp', superbly delivered by Sinatra to Hayworth.

I looked up the disc I purchased three months ago to find very little information remaining here with the note that they didn't know when to expect (that version) to be back in stock.(Just went and checked) The version I purchased (for the same price) has all of the special features and looks to be one of Amazon's ""burn on demand"" discs. Still, I wonder, aside from a new cover, what else this second (and I might presume ""official""?) release has that mine doesn't.

1467816,"Loved the film, couldn't wait for the dvd and didn't mind paying top dollar for bonus features/etc.--- but Disney did a bonehead move with it's 'second screen' feature--- while there are SOME extras- basically the extended extras/other extras are ON-LINE (like the John Carter diary, production sketches, etc.), rather than stored on either the dvd or the bluray (which would have had plenty of space to store this)... AND made a deal with Best Buy to have a limited bonus disc exclusive to the 3D bluray--- which was sold out in 4 stores in the area on the first day.If Disney is fighting lack of dvd sales, they should think far more about INCLUDING these exclusives and extras to fans of a particular movie who don't mind paying more money to be able to KEEP the extras- not view them with an internet connection, or have to run to BestBuy and fight for a limited amount of copies for extras that are ok, (the bonus disc had a couple of two-three minute extended scenes and a SHORT featurette on the making of.... there's more on the website, but who cares?

925829,"- Please note that the review you are about to read is for the 2005 Halloween-themed updating of the Sleepy Hollow legend called simply, ""The Hollow"". It is NOT for the movie Hollow Man 2. For some reason only they might know, Amazon currently has the exact same set of mixed-up reviews posted for both movies. Please bear this in mind when reading my review of The Hollow. -The weeks leading up to Halloween are always my favorite time of year. The change of seasons, with the chill in the air. The candy and the decorations. And of course the plethora of scary movies with which we are inevitably inundated. I'm all the time looking for something new or a bit different for my ""holiday"" viewing enjoyment. The Hollow is a pleasantly diverting little movie that seems to somehow get lost in the ever-increasing torrent of horror and Halloween-themed movies that turn up every year as the month of October progresses. Most of the time, I like my horror a bit more intense than most of what unfolds here, but after several viewings over the past couple of Halloween seasons, the Hollow has gradually come to be one of my annual must-watch DVDs.It's a welcome (if highly implausible) updating of the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow story, with young Kevin Zegers taking on the role of a teenaged descendant of Ichabod Crane, and the uber-cute Kaley Cuoco as his love interest. Stacy Keach is way over the top as the grizzled (and frequently inebriated) cemetery caretaker whose wild stories no one wants to believe. And Judge Reinhold shows up in a mostly thankless role as Kevin Zeigers' hard-nosed father. What could have been a typical teen hack & slash, has been toned down considerably, and except for a brief sex scene (with no real nudity), and a couple of semi-gory decapitations by the Headless Horseman, The Hollow could have easily been rated PG. In fact even with those aforementioned scenes, I'm surprised it earned an R rating rather than a PG-13. With just a few minor edits, I believe it was broadcast on ABC Family channel for several Halloweens in a row. Slightly more intense and graphic than an R.L Stein adaptation, but with a similar young adult feel to it, it delivers the goods without an over abundance of sex and violence.To be honest, The Hollow is nothing special, and not particularly inspired or original. The plot, once the movie gets going, is also pretty predictable. But it somehow puts me in just the right the mood for Halloween, with its creepy atmosphere and ghostly tale. Quite frankly, while there are a ton of far scarier horror movies out there that I truly enjoy (and some that I don't), not many of them hit all the right buttons when it comes to capturing the scary but fun (and somehow innocent) side of the holiday. The Hollow does a good job at doing just that.As I mentioned, the unedited DVD version is not really for the kiddies, and a preliminary viewing might be in order to determine if it's suitable for pre-teens. Though by today's standards, it's pretty tame, and even pre-teens would probably survive it without any permanent damage. Not really a four star movie - probably more like a three and a half. But since I'm feeling generous, along with the fact that Amazon doesn't recognize half stars, I'm rounding up to a four, at least for the moment. Not bad, and actually quite a lot of fun. You may want to give it a try next Halloween. It just might become one of your seasonal favorites too.",The Hollow

281620,"&lt;strong>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/strong> (Tom Savini, 1990)Another of those ""I swear I reviewed this back when it came out, but can find no record whatsoever of that review"" reviews. Twenty years later, therefore, I'm reviewing it again. Film culture has changed almost entirely in those twenty years; the idea of remaking a classic horror film is now as common in Hollywood as is making a rom-com, and having someone who worked on the original direct is not out of the question. In 1990, though, that was groundbreaking stuff, and we were all slavering at the bit to see what Tom Savini, who got his start as the make-up guy on the original 1968 production of &lt;em>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em>, would do with Romero's updated (without the assistance of longtime confederate John Russo, who wrote the original novel upon which the first script, by Russo and Romero, was based)  screenplay and a somewhat better-known cast who, unlike the cast of the original, were obviously destined for bigger and better things rather than being friends of the crew (or, in many cases, the crew themselves).I won't say it's totally botched. I would have in 1990. In fact, I'm pretty sure I &lt;em>did&lt;/em> in 1990. Remaking &lt;em>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em> and making Barbara a strong, intelligent female lead may have made for good press, and in fact the character of Barbara is written quite well (and brought to life exceptionally by Patricia Tallman, who would go on to fame and fortune in the TV series &lt;em>Babylon 5&lt;/em> soon after). But what you get is... not &lt;em>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em>. It's something else entirely when the major part of Ben's burden--looking after a dazed Barbara who is deeply in shock, and was never all that well put-together to begin with--is taken off his shoulders. He has more time to make good decisions, rather than the stressed-out-but-viable ones he makes in the original film. Only that doesn't happen here, and that makes the entire film even less plausible. Well, okay, talking about ""less plausible"" when dealing with a zombie movie is probably stretching it a bit, but come on. Look at the final montage in the original movie, with the rednecks driving around popping zombies. The situation is clearly under control. How did civilization get to the point of the beginning of &lt;em>Dawn of the Dead&lt;/em>? That question has been nagging at zombie fans for almost half a century, and if anything, the remake makes it even &lt;em>less&lt;/em> plausible that we could get from point A to point B, given that even rednecks could keep this thing under control. But I digress.In case you've been living in a cave since 1968, here's the plot: Barbara (Tallman) and Johnny (&lt;em>House of 1000 Corpses&lt;/em>' Bill Moseley) are in suburban Pittsburgh to put flowers on their mother's grave after church when Johnny is accosted and killed by what seems to be a demented mourner (make-up artist Greg Funk in one of his few on-camera roles). Barbara flees to a nearby farmhouse, where she finds Ben (Tony Todd, who would become an A-list horror actor two years later in &lt;em>Candyman&lt;/em>) already holed up. The crazed folks outside, of course, turn out to be the living dead, hungering for the flesh of the living, and Barbara and Ben, plus a cast of others who turn up later in the film, have to figure out how to either shore up their defenses to stop the zombies from getting in or escape to someplace more defensible.I've only touched on the cast here. Tom Towles (&lt;em>Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer&lt;/em>), William Butler (&lt;em>My Dog Skip&lt;/em>), Katie Finneran (&lt;em>You've Got Mail&lt;/em>) in her acting debut, Heather Mazur (from the short-lived TV adaptation of &lt;em>Crash&lt;/em>) in HER acting debut, and TV character actress McKee Anderson (&lt;em>Angel on My Shoulder&lt;/em>) round out the principals here. This is not a low-budget-horror-film cast. Savini, on the other hand, gets lost in the same mire a number of other successful small-screen directors get lost in: directing for the big screen is a different beast entirely. (To date, Savini has not attempted to direct another feature-length film.) Specifically, here, the pace gets muddled a lot towards the middle.None of that, however, changes the movie's major failing: taking Barbara's character through a one-eighty without any thought as to what sort of fallout that would entail among the character dynamics or the greater interaction with the world in general. And, as a result, it stands as an interesting, if failed, attempt to kind of requantify the canon. It's worth watching once for comparison purposes, but for the most part, just stick with the original and you'll be fine. **",N/A

I am a child of the 80's, so maybe that explains why i'm so attached to the film and didn't mind as many things as other reviewers. This is just your typical, ball-busting action flick, from the early part of my favorite decade ever!The basis of this movie is, that the Soviet Union has depleted many of their resources, and now they and their commie allies are coming to America to take what's left over here. After the initial attack, the U.S. Army is pushed back all the way to Denver, and this group of highschoolers form a resistance to the communist invasion. The group which includes young stars Charlie Sheen, Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Lea Thompson, and C. Thomas Howell (who also plays my favorite part as Robert) start killing commies left and right, trying to save the world one ruskie at a time. While The movie is extremely dated, as it was made at the height of the ""Red Scare"" in the 80's, but this flick is just non-stop action throughout. You can imagine the end, most of the ""Wolverines"" as they call themselves, die a heroes death defending our rights and freedoms, and eventually even the tough commie leader goes a little soft in the end.This is really an awesome flick.

1438247,"The four ""Four Daughters"" movies produced by Warner Brothers from 1938-1941 are an interesting mix of mild comedy and soap opera drama.Claude Rains plays the crusty, but lovable father of four grown, beautiful daughters who are all still living at home. Rains' older sister ""Aunt Emma"" is played by the wonderful May Robson, who died shortly after the last of these four movies was made. Rains makes his living providing music lessons in his home and being the head of a local music foundation.  Aside from his family, he lives for classical music, and frowns upon loud ""swing"" music that's all the rage.The kind, wholesome daughters are played by three real-life sisters: Priscilla, Rosemary, and Lola Lane; and the fourth is Gale Page, the tall sister with the husky voice.These films are nostalgic, romanticized movie slices of small town American life in the years just before Pearl Harbor, courtesy of the Warner Brothers backlot. Few towns may have been like the home town where the ""Four Daughters"" lived and loved, but it's nice to think that at least some were.Here's the order in which this series was made and released to theaters: 1. Four Daughters (1938); 2. Daughters Courageous (1939); 3. Four Wives (1939); and 4. Four Mothers (1941).Daughter Courageous is the odd film in the series. It was rushed into release to capitalize on the rising stardom of John Garfield. He was the ""troubled"" young man who was killed in Four Daughters, the first film of the series.In order to bring him back to life, so to speak, Warner Brothers devised a plan to use the same Four Daughters cast, but changed all the names, professions, etc., and also messed around with other formula elements that were established in the first film.By making all these changes, Daughters Courageous became a stand-alone film that does not fit into the chronological order of the other three films in the series.Here's the order that I would recommend watching these films, so that one film logically leads into the next one: 1. Four Daughters (1938); 2. Four Wives (1939); 3. Four Mothers (1941); and then 4. Daughters Courageous (1939).Reviews of each film can be found by other reviewers or under the individual titles of each film. Also, it is more economical to buy all four films together in this collection.  The Four Daughters Collection costs about half the price of buying each title on an individual basis.

They eventually recruit the anti-bully anti-hero rough and tough kid (played by an actor I don't remember), and the three set out to build an elaborate flying machine. Unfortunately, what starts out in what could be a very interesting premise given these character's personalities is wasted on a plot that nobody really cares for. River invents some sort of hovering device which he can somehow create using his computer and control it as well. The effects for this pink ball thing are cheesy at best, but then again I'll forgive it as this is an 80's budget film. The three boys then go to a scrap yard and we get our obligatory montage scene of the them using all types of hardware to create a floating metal ball they can all three travel in. All this time you're wondering where the movie is actually going, or if there is any real conflict or antagonist these kids encounter. There isn't. Thus still, we're there watching these three kids we ACTUALLY LIKE going through the motions of a preset barely average plot.The kids eventually get into outer space and land in some kind of ship where they meet up with a very child-friendly green googly-eyed alien who just happens to be just around the three boys' ages. They also meet his googly-eyed kid alien sister. What follows is the second half of this mostly yawn-inducing yarn where we just get to watch this dumb alien spout off pop culture tv references. The three boys are figuring out that these aliens are ""just like them,"" so as not to scare any little kids watching the movie. The alien kids eventually get in trouble with their alien dad and the three boys are back off to their own home planet.The biggest gripe I had with this movie is that it really does nothing, and goes nowhere. There is no real conflict between the boys and another antagonist, or even conflicts within the boys themselves. The film starts off showing these three boys in their middle school setting, which could very well have been used to introduce new characters that maybe the boys could have had some sort of dealings with in regards to their space project. One girl shows up who Ethan Hawke's character likes but nothing is ever made of it. The rebellious boy of the trio saves Hawke's character from getting beat up, but nothing is ever made of the conflict between them and the bullies. Not even any of their parents are ever showcased. In short, nothing is ever done. What is even more aggravating than this is that these boys really do put on great performances, and each of their own characters is highlighted well, thus we come to really like them, and maybe hope they can be used in some other ways. Perhaps Ethan could have ""accidently"" brought on board the girl he likes, or be forced to do so. Perhaps one of their parents could have come into conflict with them and their spaceship building project. Perhaps the bullies could have messed up the boys' plans somehow, or stolen the science nerd's idea about the flying orb, and used it in irresponsible ways, causing the boys to devise some kind of plan. I don't know, SOMETHING besides what we get here. Because anything else would have worked given the three very good and willing actors these filmmakers had to work with. Yet we get nothing, and I wish the entire portion of the scipt having the boys land on the alien spaceship had been scrapped, as that overly long, overly annoying and overly boring part of the film really ruins the entire thing completely.So if you want to put on something that'll entertain your 3 year old (as I don't really see this film entertaining anyone older than that), then buy this one and pop it in for an hour and a half. They'll forget it in 10 minutes, as will you.",Explorers VHS
1442506,"Liked the movie - was a good way to spend 2 hours - not the best horror movie I've seen, mostly predictible, but enjoyed the actors and we live in the Detroit area so that was fun for us as well.I'd recommend it for a good entertaining evening - not too scary but you do jump on a couple of occassions and go 'eeewwwh!'.  Liked the resolution and Jeri Ryan was very enjoyable.  You know how the people always go down into the dark & creepy basement when they KNOW they shouldn't?  Didn't happen so much in this film - they seemed to react more like I'd think real people would - protecting their kids but not being silly.We had a problem with the first dvd that we ordered and Amazon fixed our problem for us even though it was after the 30 days time frame to return it.THANK YOU Amazon!!!!

1554354,"There were a spate of ""Roaring Twenties"" tv shows in the late '50's and early '60's, the most famous of which was The Untouchables.  The lawless Years was the best of them.  It had high production values with top notch actors like Vic Morrow, Paul Richards and Jack Weston.  Even Burt Reynolds gave an excellent performance as a sleezy thug.  There were few noticable historical inaccuracies like gangsters roaring through a drive-by shooting, in 1929, with a 1935 Pierce-Arrow, which happened all the time in The Untouchables.  The writing provided stories and dialog that was quite advanced for the time and characterizations were believable and sympathetic.  (Yeah, even the bad guys.)  James Gregory did a creditable presentation of tough guy cop, Barney Ruditski, complete with the suggestion of belts and rubber hose interrogations, entirely in keeping with the period.  Of course, squeeky clean, super straight Eliot Ness would never stoop to such low tactics. (yeah, right.)Much has been made of the visual quality of these discs, such as the strange coloration and general muddiness of images on the early discs.  Maybe it's because I remember too well how television reception appeared at the time, but none of this detracted in the least from my enjoyment of thses shows.  These episodes are, after all, film (or tv) noir, and they're supposed to look dark and gloomyI liked The Lawless Years very much and I applaude Timeless Media Group for providing an excellent product, except, - - -the plastic box that the discs are supposed to be stored in virtually disintergrated upon being opened.",N/A

But, having said that, our whole family really enjoyed the film and I would recommend watching it for the great story, beautiful scenes, and pretty good action.  Also, I feel this movie is very appropriate for young adults (e.g. teenagers) - there wasn't a lot of gratuitous swearing and killing.

1505359,"The new horror thriller ""Cold Sweat"" is a movie sure to divide its audience. I suspect that there will be plenty of aggressively negative reviews on one hand, but a number of equally supportive raves as well. This exercise in outrageousness from Argentina may not make a lot of sense in the grand scheme of things, but its sheer wackiness almost compensates for its narrative shortcomings. As much as my instincts tell me that I should completely write this one off, I simply can't. Part of my nature embraces what I like to call ""bad movie magic,"" and this spirited film embraces a nonsensical lunacy that it's hard not to appreciate on some level. So if you can disconnect your common sense and just enjoy the visceral unpleasantness of ""Cold Sweat,"" the movie does offer a uniquely skewed nightmare with a gritty visual style.Transpiring in what amounts to real time, this eighty minute film takes place almost entirely within the confines of one decrepit domicile. A man and his female friend arrive at the location because he is searching for answers about his recent break-up. They've tracked down this address as belonging to someone his ex engaged with online, and he wants to confront his former girlfriend. Once he gets inside, however, things go from bad to worse as unimaginable horrors are around every bend. Two elderly political radicals, strange experiments, and a house full of unstable explosives are just a few of the hurdles our hero must face. Can he find his girlfriend? Can anyone ever find the door out? Just what's happening in the basement? And who will survive this ever-escalating night of dread? No spoilers here, this is truly one you have to watch.The Bad:The political back story of the villains is vague and unenlightening.The current goals of the villains are also rather open-ended.Their experiments get no explanation.The good guys bumble around instead of trying to get out.Oftentimes they are hiding within one foot of the bad guys in plain sight, but aren't discovered.Good guys never seek help or do anything that seems rational.The Good:Amusing banter of villains, like a dysfunctional married couple.Good effects, nicely photographed.A few nice horror moments, even if they don't always make sense.Unsettling atmosphere.In truth, the cons probably outweigh the pros if you're keeping count. But writer/director Adrian Garcia Bogliano is committed to this piece of madness. I found moments painfully dumb and the script was filled with unanswered questions, but I couldn't tear my eyes away. And I was laughing throughout the ending (unintentional or not). If you analyze this picture, it just doesn't work. But if you're expectations are in check, there is plenty of gleeful nastiness. Almost a bad movie classic. I can't recommend this to most people, but some will truly embrace the insanity. KGHarris, 1/12.",Cold Sweat
1448013,"I have seen many of Gary Oldman's films and the man really intrigues me. He is probably the best character actor of our day and yet he does not seem to get the better films.

1541587,"Who created the vibrator?Perhaps this thought may have occurred to you once before?  Maybe not.For the 2011 film ""Hysteria"", directed by Tanya Wexler (""Finding North"", ""Ball in the House"") and writers Stephen and Jonah Lisa Dyer, they explore the invention of the device.  But instead of presenting a film that you would imagine to be sexually naughty, they present the film to show how the invention of the device was due to how women's hysteria (nervousness, loss of appetite, stress, sexual desire) was treated back in the late 1800&#8242;s.Long ago, female hysteria was once-common medical diagnosis that dates back for hundreds and possibly thousands of years.  And the diagnosis and treatment for hundreds of years was through pelvic massage, rather the manual stimulation of the vulva by a doctor trained in producing of what was called ""hysterical paroxysm"".  It was realized later on that ""hysterical paroxysm"" would be better known as an ""orgasm"".And one of those doctors who treated women was Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville, the man, along with an inventor would go on to create the first electromechanical vibrator (which would be known as Granville's Hammer) in 1883.With the film ""Hysteria"", while not entirely a factual biography of Granville's life, the film is based on a true story.The British film would star Hugh Dancy (""Black Hawk Down"", ""King Arthur"", ""Confessions of a Shopaholic""), Maggie Gyllenhaal (""The Dark Knight"", ""Donnie Darko""), Jonathan Pryce (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""Brazil"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies""), Felicity Jones (""Like Crazy"", ""The Tempest""), Rupert Everett (""My Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Shrek"" films) and Ashley Jensen (""Ugly Betty"").And now, ""Hysteria"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in Sept. 2012 courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.""Hysteria"" is set in the 19th Century, during a time where women were treated for their hysteria by massaging the vulva/genital area of a woman to produce a ""paroxysmal convulsion"" and among the men who specialized in it was Dr. Robert Dalrymple (portrayed by Jonathan Pryce).  Dr. Robert Dalrymple is a reputable man who has two daughters, the kind and proper Emily (portrayed by Felicity Jones) and her older sister, the rebellious Charlotte (portrayed by Maggie Gyllenhaal), a pre-modern feminist.Robert needs another to help him in his practice, so he hires a young doctor named Dr. Mortimer Granville (portrayed by Hugh Dancy) and as Mortimer learns how to treat women through his training sessions observing Dr. Dalrymple, he starts to date Emily.And as Dr. Granville becomes well-known for his work, the practice begins to gain a good following and more women start to come in.  But it also starts to affect Dr. Granville's hand muscles and women start to feel that he is not being affective in bringing out their paroxysmal convulsions.  It embarrasses Dr. Dalrymple to have his popular clients feeling unfulfilled, that he has to fire Dr. Granville.Staying with his friend Lord Edmunt St. John-Smythe (portrayed by Rupert Everett), an inventor trying to perfect his invention, an electronic feather duster.  While holding it, he starts to realize how soothing it feels on his hand courtesy of its vibrations.  And then Dr. Granville comes up with an idea, how about using this invention to create a vibrator that can be used to create paroxysmal convulsions, so a doctor no longer needs to use his hand?And sure enough, he tests the new invention on Molly the Lolly (portrayed by Sheridan Smith) and in a short amount of time, he is able to produce three paroxysmal convulsions.  Shocked by the success of the device, what if Dr. Granville can utilize the device on a woman for treatment of hysteria?Meanwhile, problems develop between Dr. Robert Dalrymple and his rebellious daughter Charlotte.  And as the family tends to avoid her, Dr. Granville starts to see the good in her and starts to fall for her.  But what of his relationship with Emily?VIDEO:""Hysteria"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  First, I have to say that the costume design for this film is wonderful.  And watching this film in HD, definitely brings out the details of the Victorian style.  Closeups are well-detailed, skintones are natural, black levels nice and deep.  The film looks very good on Blu-ray and I detected no banding or artifact issues during my viewing of ""Hysteria"".AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Hysteria"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and is primarily a dialogue driven film.  Aside from one case where the testing of the vibrator uses up the electricity and you hear a pop, the majority of the film is dialogue and its musical soundtrack.  Both are crystal clear and there is some use of surround channels during scenes featuring a crowd.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Hindi.SPECIAL FEATURES""Hysteria?"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring an upbeat audio commentary by Director Tanya Wexler.An Evening with Tanya Wexler, Hugh Dancy and Jonathan Pryce - (12:26) Director Tanya Wexler, Hugh Dancy and Jonathan Pryce answers questions from the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival.Hysteria: Behind the Scenes - (5:41) A behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film with the director, producers and talent of ""Hysteria"".Deleted Scenes - (2:52) Featuring four deleted scenes.Passion & Power: The Technology of Orgasm - (43:07) A documentary on the origin of the vibrator and the treatment of hysteria.Theatrical Trailer - (1:26) The original theatrical trailer for ""Hysteria"".JUDGMENT CALL:I'm often curious about how things are invented, but when I saw the trailer for ""Hysteria"" and how it dealt with the invention of the vibrator, not only did it catch my eye, I was fascinated by the concept but also even more intrigued about how female hysteria was treated by doctors through genital massages to produce what would be know as an orgasm.I never knew that there was such a medical disorder and that doctors were specially trained to handle such a thing.And while the trailer may lead one to think that such a film would be naughty and doctors using such a practice for their own sexual desires, fortunately ""Hysteria"" is not that.  This was a longtime practice and belief that women had symptoms that can be alleviated by a pelvic massage and that a person can be alleviated of their stress, sexual desires, nervousness, muscle spasms via""hysterical paroxysm"" (or orgasm).And I can see in a medical sense, how the vibrator would be an important device for doctors at that time, because so many women were being treated, these doctors would suffer muscular cramps on their hands because some women would not respond and have a hysterical paroxysm so easily.So, that was all intriguing to me and the story based on the creation of the vibrator because of the treatment of hysteria was fascinating.  Granted, although based on a true story, I'm not sure if the life of Dr. Mortimer Granville was as exciting.  His life was surely romanticized for ""Hysteria"" and given much humor, the film was entertaining.  Especially to see how a feather duster would eventually lead to the vibrator is amusing and how its presented is quite fun and hilarious.""Hysteria"" was no doubt an entertaining film thanks to its talents.  Hugh Dancy, Jonathan Pryce, Felicity Jones and Rupert Everett were great.  And as for Maggie Gyllenhaal, I was worried how she would portray an English accent but sure enough, she did a magnificent job.As for the Blu-ray release of ""Hysteria"", while the picture quality and audio quality were very good, it's the inclusion of the documentary ""Passion & Power: The Technology of Orgasm"" that I found educational and entertaining.  I had no idea that treatment of hysteria has gone on so long and was recorded by physicians.  But the amount of research that went into making this documentary was fascinating and to see how the perception of vibrators have changed.  From being featured to magazines in the distant past to some states having strict rules for women (especially the state of Dallas) who has no law of how many guns a man can have, but yet a woman who has more than five vibrators is breaking the law.  Interesting!Overall, ""Hysteria"" is a fascinating and fun film that shows people of a past that probably, many have forgotten or didn't know about.  But also how the invention of the vibrator came to be.  Fun, naughty and entertaining, ""Hysteria"" on Blu-ray is recommended.",N/A
382806,"Black Adder is unlike any TV series done before or since, a very silly, but alsovery smart comedy, each season took place about a hundred years later thanthe series before, but always with Rowan Atkinson playing Backadder. Howevereach time not only the basic situation and story, but also Blackadder's characterwas different. True, he's basically always looking out for himself, but in one seasonhe might be a sniveling simp, the next might find him dashing, handsome andcaustically witty. Some of the key supporting actors (including an the wonderfulTony Robinson, and the always hysterical Hugh Laurie) go from season to season,with Laurie playing a bevy of different roles, and Robinson the one true constantas Blackadder's sad-sack abused and not very bright sidekick.So rather than a TV series as we generally know it, what we really have is 4 differentseries, in different eras, held together by casting. Even the theme song is re-workedeach time (although using the same basic tune)By casting from such a wide net, from setting it in the era of Richard III for season1 (and getting in some wicked parody of the Shakespeare play), to the darkabsurdity of WW I by the last, we really have an overview of time that makes theseries resonate long after you finish it.While personally I find, for example, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python moreconsistently laugh out loud funny, I find I remember more of the story andcharacters from Blackadder.I'd urge everyone to give it a look, and keep in mind that the many find thefirst season the most heady, and least funny. It grows from there.The quality on the remastered edition is a step up from these older DVDs,but is far from spectacular, and really, no one is buying Blackadder forvisual quality anyway.

Ran across Hindi films to review started looking for Monsoon wedding to view it again and saw this great looking guy on the cover of this movie . Akshay Kumar. The rest is history. Three or so months later and a bunch of bollywood buys off of Amazon and I have still held this one in my head as a real romance novel come to life , well real as in humans acting it out.The intro to Aki's character depicts him  as a simple engineer and customer svc rep manager for Toyota . He is on his way, late of course, to his engagement ceremony which is engaging; pardon the pun. After the party the pain begins. He is dragged down the walk way towards her house and you start to get a true taste of Bipasha's idea of their future in their non-romantic marriage. Later the plane ride to hell. No children for quite a while bomb dropped on him, no real discussing it, no touchy feely emotions etc. You begin to feel sorry for this character who is so lovable ,romantic at heart, cuddly wants children and is family driven . It's hard to watch her cut him into pieces. He's attracted to her and she acts coldly logical all the time. She would be a perfect corportate wife. Aware of appearances and organized with an eye to the future of her ""House"" (dynasty).Big time fashion model/ desinger . He's lovable, she's not. At least I don't have to feel guilty for not liking Bips in this one..I swear that woman is so wooden if you threw a match within fifty feet of her she'd burst into flames. More of the same in this one. Feel free to hate her till the very last scene. Enter tall willowy beauty katrina kaif with sweet disposition , soft hearted ,trusting, lonely mostly friendless in this country Canada and similar interest, but engaged to a powerful work-aholic. Keep running her gorgeous lonely character into your very handsome nice guy over and over and you begin to get the impression that fate is toying with them. Fate is not very kind at first. Here's your soul mate. Try not to fall in love with her.Memorable poignant moments, A slightly villainous fiance for Katrina and a loving supporting family that is slowly beginning to wonder what's going on for Akshay to have to deal with . He's engaged after all . Every time they turn around here's this sweet girl they all really like but she is not his fiance who they are also fond of .  The musical numbers are really modern tempo great club style choreographed numbers. Awesome one of Aki on his motorcycle with katrina draped over backwards while they are riding . Wonder if they really did that scene without a stunt double for her. Couple of songs done in the Hindi romantic style in pretty locals with water and mountains. Great scenery pics.The very able Anil Kapoor is perfect as the power driven fiance for Kaif who wants everything his own and no sharing. This makes him somewhat sympathetic as well but scary possibly mafia connected too . He's the more ruthless version of Bipasha's character. He's good at ruthless. Come to think of it his character  and Bips would be perfect for one another.",Humko Deewana Kar Gaye anglais

1367087,"An amazing film by the violence it contains. It is both realistic and frightening.Gay people, young and old, are forced to live a clandestine life with an underground satisfaction of their desires or impulses. They have against them three types of people. The parents, in this case essentially a mother, who cannot understand that at age 14 her son can have some desires and can try to get them satisfied. She is a bigot. If he would look for girls she would just be satisfied but not for boys, what's more men.The second type of enemies are gangs of gay hunters or in fact hunters of anything that is different and one of their victims is a gay waiter who is just walking home through a common park. He will be beaten to death. Another one is an Asian young teenager who is playing the violin and preparing for some Royal Academy of Music. We only see at the end the smashed violin in some underpass.The third type of enemies is more vicious because it does not even have the excuse of gang rule. It is purely individualistic isolated gay-bashers who go around, let one flirt with them and then trap him in a way or another and smash him to death. The film has one moment of extremely morbid humor here since one of these predators meet with another of these predators and one will end up in hospital.Gay men seem to have one more enemy which is among themselves this time. It is unfaithfulness. One couple gets their civil partnership celebrated and while everyone is having fun, the older groom flirts with the waiter in the pantry in the basement of the house. Pretty ugly for that predator of another type, a predator who only has one objective: have his way with as many gay men as possible while his civil union gives him some kind of cover up for his feline treacherous behavior.That is sordid, bleak, and even morbid in a way. And yet there may be some hope in all that darkness. The hope of maybe some might start feeling differently about it, feeling that all men have the same right to love those they want and want to be loved and to love back. The hope that one closeted gay man might do the right thing and help the police catch the killers who took the life of the waiter. And eventually the second groom of the ""married"" couple coming across the ring he gave his partner on the finger of one of the solitary gay-bashers who got beaten up by the other solitary gay-basher understands that his own partner has given his ring to someone and this ring ended up on the finger of someone who was not at the wedding ceremony or celebration. The police will sort out the rest. That's the hope, but wrapped up in so much muck.The film is supposed to be based on true facts and to have been shot to help develop a debate in our societies. It sure brings up many questions and no easy answer because you can change the law, you can change the police, you can change courts and judges, but to change the mentality and minds of bigots and hunters hunting human preys for the fun of catching, torturing and then killing those who are dressed to kill in a way and yet are killed by those who are just by-standers who should have let life live the way it wanted to be lived.Such crimes might finally get down in number and gravity when everyone will have the same rights and the law gives everyone the same dignity and freedom. But it will be long and difficult. Bigotry is alas very well and widely spread and we have not invented yet the bigotry-collecting trucks and machines to get it to the closest bigotry dump.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Clapham Junction
1094011,"Is San Francisco the place where an alcoholic assassin from Buffalo might find sobriety? Apparently that's the prescription for Frank Falenczyk (Ben Kingsley), at least according to his uncle Roman, head of a Buffalo crime family that values Frank's skills but can no longer rely on him to get the job done when it needs to get done. (He's supposed to have killed Dennis Farina, which is always a good idea in movies like this, but fails due to being smashed out of his gourd while on the job.) Frank, it has to be said, is a murdering scumbag who's circling the drain in Buffalo and doesn't really give a damn. Redemption? Self-awareness? He had no use for them. He's fine with who he is and what he does, and only gradually comes consider the possibility that maybe he doesn't want to go down the drain after all. Armed with Ben Kingsley's charisma and a blunt honesty, Frank makes friends in Frisco and manages fitful progress in getting on top of the booze, only to have his old life in Buffalo call on him to be the coldly efficient killer he once was. Can Frank, who once relied on Roman to tell him where to aim, step up sober in the crunch and call the shots?Frank is in that brotherhood of cinematic villains who are far more dangerous to other villains than to decent citizens, and Ben Kingsley is quite convincing and fun in this turn. Even more fun is Bill Pullman as Frank's slimeball minder in San Francisco; the economy with which he establishes a basis on which the two men may thoroughly dislike each other is impressive. T&eacute;a Leoni also acquits herself well as a not particularly bereft new widow with personality quirks that not only allow you to buy her attraction to Frank but also leave you wondering if she really ought to be allowed to run around loose. Luke Wilson has the least to contribute as a fellow alcoholic who puts himself forward to be Frank's sponsor--the two have some nice moments, but nothing the movie really requires. And while Frank's time in 'Frisco is diverting, it's the crime drama playing out in Frank's absence in Buffalo that really propels the narrative; Frank's failure is the pivot on which events turn, and it is these events that afford Frank a chance at a species of something that might matter to him after all: redemption.",You Kill Me

He is to go to Earth and find the Tesseract and open a portal into space so that the Chitauri can send an army to conquer the world.  They promise that Loki can be the ruler of the Earth.  Loki wants to rule the Earth but he also wants vengeance on his adopted brother Thor.The Tesseract is an ancient artifact of unlimited power that by legend comes from Asgard and was owned by Odin. Some on earth are trying to harness its power to generate unlimited energy to light the world while others want to use it to create weapons of mass destruction.  The Tesseract begins emitting energy pulses of its own accord and it opens a portal through which Loki arrives on Earth.Loki uses a saber energy weapon to convert some of the people into his followers and to kill others. Loki and his followers steal the Tesseract cube and shoot Director Fury. Loki has taken a key agent, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner, Hawkeye) and the main scientist for the project. The cavern the laboratory is built in collapses and a crater a mile across is created as the Tesseract runs out of control from the overload of energy.  Director Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson) barely escapes with his life while Loki and his team escape with the Tesseract cube.Director Fury brings together a team of super humans, a god and a pair of assassins to form a team called The Avengers.  The team members are Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow, The Hulk, Captain America, and eventually Hawkeye and the task is simple.  Defeat Loki and conquer the invading aliens or face the destruction of the Earth.....This is a fast action film filled with marvelous special effects and a good storyline.  I loved the interaction between the Avenger members, the action and at times the comedy was wonderful.  This is a top notch film and I really enjoyed it from start to finish.  This film was entertaining and my family enjoyed it a lot.  I recommend it to you.",Marvel's: The Avengers
1362679,"I just want to thank Amazon's Prime Instant Video for once again providing me access with a new favorite BBC show that I will plan on watching in the future.Being a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's it was with great pleasure to see this update to the consulting detective. Fans of Steven Moffat (Coupling and Dr. Who) will definitely want to tune in to see how he has updated one of the most famous detectives in literary times (next to Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple).The new television series stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson.For fans of the Sherlock Holmes novels many of you should be familiar withA Study in Scarletsince that was the first novel by Doyle that introduced the characters of Sherlock Holmes to Dr. John Watson. This new series keeps elements of ""A Study in Scarlet"" intact such as Holmes and Watson meeting for the first time. However, there are updates due to the technology of the day.We have Holmes and Watson meeting once again through a mutual friend and agreeing to move in together at 221 B Baker Street.Due to inexplicable suicides DI Greg Lestrade played by Rupert Graves, consults with Holmes in order to determine out a perpetrator in these crimes. Unlike the atagonism that was between Lestrade and Holmes in the novels, in this television update, Lestrade uses Holmes in order to solve tough and baffling cases. And at one point says to Watson, ""Sherlock Holmes is a great man. I hope one day that he can be a good man.""This is episode 1 of series 1 and runs 90 minutes. I would recommend that you plan on hitting pause if you leave the room for very long since watching Holmes break down a puzzle or being able to determine so much about a person in 30 seconds is awe inspiring to watch and see.We get introduced to Holmes older brother Mycroft Holmes and for the first time hear the name, ""Moriarity"".  What is great to see is the developing friendship between Holmes and Watson. We have several running gags between Holmes and Watson's living arrangements with everyone thinking they are a couple and with Watson's outright admiration of Holmes intellect. There were several laugh out loud moments for me (when Holmes tells Watson to think it through next time someone offers him a bribe, they could have split it, being just one for me).The show often helps a viewer out by showing what text messages say or show you what Holmes is seeing when he looks at someone.I was able to view this episode for free through the Amazon Prime Program.Definitely recommend watching!",Sherlock: Season 1
813738,"Lets be honest here, if you are going to have a movie collection this is a must have so any review bad or good is not going to matter if you are really serious about having a great movie collection. I am not going to get into the technical details or into the contents of the extra features or what Peter Jackson should have & shouldn't have included from the books. It is the movie and how good it looks and sounds is what I care about.  I do not think this is going to be released again any time soon (until the 3D release)so if you are not planning on going 3D anytime soon you should buy this. Helpful hint I have learned. Place it in your shopping cart and leave it there so you will get updates on price drops. I did and finally a great deal came along. If you find a good price get it now as they will likely increase or at the least stay the same the closer it gets to the release of The Hobbit later this year.1st off, I looked at the 1 star reviews and although there are several complaints about a green tint to FOTR I did not see it so there must have been a bad batch or since it has been out a few months now they may have fixed it. The picture and sound are superb, full rich colors and deep dark blacks make this the best looking movie I have ever bought. I paid a little over 60.00 including shipping so this is the most expensive dvd I have ever bought. I have a 2D-3D conversion blu-ray player and the 2D to 3D looked the same as Star Wars Episode 1 in the theaters now but since this was not released as a 3D set you can't hold that against them. Since this is a one of a kind movie that will not be remade for a long long long time I suggest you buy this. The blu-ray's superior pic & sound makes it a must if you are the least bit serious about owning a real movie collection. The sound is amazing. The 7.1 channels are crisp and clear. As I was watching the scene in Bilbo's Hobbit hole between him & Gandalf I kept hearing a crackling noise that I had never heard before. After investigating I realized it was the sound of the fire crackling in Bilbo's fire place. Several times I turned my head to look for sounds coming from the surround speakers that I had never heard before when watching these movies. There are certain staples that any movie buff must have in their collection. Things like The Wizard of OZ, Jaws, Gone With The Wind and other classics and ground breaking movies. The Lord Of The Rings Extended Edition in Blu-Ray is a new staple that all movies buffs should add ASAP. Great price, great product I give it 5 stars & two thumbs up.  P.S. I have only had the time to watch FOTR, will update as I watch the others.",N/A

It was in a very small theatre, and the people in the theatre could hear me non-stop laughing.  I really enjoyed this movie.  Since I am now married with children, I don't laugh as much when I watch it, but I could watch it over and over again and enjoy it.  I love the theme song, it really fit the movie.  My personal favorites are Richard Dreyfuss and his leaky phone booth, his chanting with burning incense, the panties drying on the rod, Marsha Mason working for the men from Subaro cars,  Dreyfuss as a bouncer,  Quinn's swearing when unexpected made it funny too.  This movie will always be dear to my heart.  For the people who have never had a chance to watch it,  please pick up a copy with Dreyfuss and Mason, do not watch the most recent one first (I personally didn't think it was any good, compare to this one.  This movie is not for children.  I would say teen and up only.  My oldest is 10 and I wouldn't let her watch this until she's in high school.  There are many adult situations.  But overall, it is really a movie that could be true to life and I found myself really getting into this movie and feeling really bad for Mason.  Don't worry though, the ending assures you happiness.  Please give this one a chance, you won't be disappointed.  It is definitely one of my top five favorite movies of all time.",N/A

It follows the high school mariachi band at Zapata High School as it enters two major competitions in Texas in 2010. Their leader - a music teacher - has led this school through many championship wins and tries to do it again. (To give you the answer, would spoil the fun.). We get to meet selected students in this low economic community and hear their plans and aspirations. And we get to hear some great music - though only one number is presented complete.With under an hour - as compared to the longer time length of similar ""teacher trains the students in a school to both win a competition and mature"" documentaries - there is not a lot of time for both the story and music.I really enjoyed getting to know the students, though there is never a point where you feel these kids are in danger. (The only parent you meet is one who owns a horse farm.)The other thing that is missing is an ""epilogue"". Most of those students followed were seniors. We hear that most went on to higher learning. But we want to know more. One talented young girl wanted to go to Harvard. (So, where did she go after graduation.)The DVD won't be released until September 11th.

1536053,"When adults describe a what is nominally a children's show as multi-layered, what we usually really mean is that it has all of two layers: one for the kids and one for us. Adventure Time is so much more. Don't be fooled by the extreme minimalism of the artwork or the simplicity of the basic storylines: this is a _very_ complex and thoughtful piece of television. Not every single episode lives up to the standard I've just described. But as a totality, the season most definitely does.Adventure Time is the kind of show you can watch as an adult, see maybe half a dozen episodes and think you know exactly where you are. Then along will come an episode that blows away your entire understanding of what it is you're watching. Then, maybe another half dozen episodes down the track, just when you've settled down and think you've regained your bearings, along will come yet another episode that once again changes everything.And so on.Perhaps fittingly for a show that will turn many a grown-up's understanding of what a cartoon can be on its head, Adventure Time is entirely uninhibited in referencing an incredibly broad range of cultural touchstones.  Whether making subtle ""in"" jokes about Dungeons & Dragons or drawing on Aristotelian theories of tragedy, if there is one thing that Adventure Time is not, it is a show that assumes that the viewer is stupid. The thing I personally love most about it is the supremely gentle way that it lets us know that yes, there is real darkness in this world, even as it encourages us to confront that darkness with courage and personal integrity; and without losing our own sense of joy and playfulness in the process.In the end, we might almost say that Adventure Time is a show with as many layers as the viewer him or her self is ready for.If you miss out on this one, you'll really have missed out on something special.Theo.",N/A

It is also a very timely story, what with all that is going on in the world today. It was interesting to see the contrasts with the movie starting a couple decades back.The kids playing Amir and Hassan were excellent. Not that I could understand the words, but the acting seemed sincere and well-done. I was just horrified at the Hassan attack scene and Amir running away, and that it led to the ruin of their friendship. They had been so inseparable it seemed they would be friends for life. How could you not run in and at least attempt to save your friend? Or at least not attempt to patch up your friendship later? Well, you have to remember he was just a little boy, and keep watching the movie from there. It was very disturbing though.The movie redeemed itself from there. Amir tried to move on with his life. He also tried to redeem himself. I thought it was a shame we never got to see more of Hassan. He was a very strong character and could have accomplished things. The ending was good. Kind of sad, but the best that could have happened under the circumstances.The kite flying scenes were beautiful. Exciting even! I never knew you could do all that with a kite. I was a bit disappointed to see in the special features that they used CGI kites instead of real kites. Always taking the easy way out these days.It would be nice if the movie had stated it was not in English. The trailer showed no non-English scenes and the back of the DVD says it IS in English.

Very disappointed, there was no plot and a lot of the storylines didn't make sense or fit with the movie. What was the point of the relationship between Mike and Joanna? The drug storyline?  There is a LOT of eye candy in this movie and it almost makes up for how bad it really is! Alex Pettyfer's character, The Kid really acted like a kid, he was sulking, pouting, or making bad decisions throughout the movie!The only good thing about this movie was Channing Tatum, he is a really talented dancer who can act, he just needs the right material. The scene where he danced to the song Pony was HOT!!!! Wait until this one comes out on cable!!",N/A

1220379,"The Great Depression is an informative, educational and even captivating documentary; I learned so much from watching this! Mario Cuomo, former Governor of New York, hosts and sometimes narrates during the archival footage; and there's lots of archival footage at that! There are some re-enactments but it's all very well done. The story of the Great Depression unfolds at a good pace that didn't drag me into boredom; the musical score enhances the film as well.There's so much to learn from watching this film that I scarcely know where to begin. True, some believe this is a type of ode to the liberal FDR administration ""saving"" the country from the Depression; but there are so many stories of people suffering that I don't believe that the film has a true liberal slant. In addition, the film is divided into four parts concerning The New Deal; the effect of mass media on the American people and the role of entertainment at the time. Hoboes riding the rails; labor strikes and often violent confrontations between anguished citizens and police are also highlighted.The film show how ill equipped Hoover was when The Depression began; he tried lowering income taxes but when taxes were only $6 on the average $4,000 per year salary there wasn't much to lower for struggling Americans.  By stark contrast, FDR promised he could solve the economic crisis; and his magnetic personality as opposed to the blame people leveled at Herbert Hoover personally made Hoover an easy target in 1932 and of course as we know FDR won that election in a landslide victory. Even FDR had his problems, though--some of his plans were thrown out by the Supreme Court while others like the NRA were introduced with mixed results.The film covers many different angles of the times; this impresses me. We see political battles including the sobering and most unpleasant effect Huey Long had on numerous other politicians including FDR; and there is a wonderful segment on Dorothea Lange who took so many poignant photographs of people barely surviving during the 1930s, including her very famous photograph of a starving woman in the plains with her two children turning their heads away from the camera. Dorothea got results, too--after that particular incident, within days food was being sent to the makeshift camps where that woman and others were living.There's still much, much more; and all of it is first-rate material. I highly recommend this documentary for anyone studying The Great Depression; the history of the FDR administration and even the Hoover administration; and people who appreciate historical documentaries with social and cultural aspects.",N/A
1505685,"Being a nature freak who watches documentaries majority of the time, BBC, National Geography, etc., I was aware of this film maker, husband and wife Jouberts some 20 years ago when I watched their lion documentary on PBS which came out as a DVD in 2006National Geographic - Relentless Enemies [Blu-ray]. Even then I was impressed with Jouberts and I just did not know how could they ever break their own record but they did without any problem. The Last Lions is a documentary not a movie but when it gets going, the screenplay of this documentary is so inspiring, the cinematography so beautiful, the narataror Jeremy Irons speaks so clearly without any stupid loud music, the music that is played is so enchanting, on and on and on, that I kept asking myself, how in the world anyone could find such a inspiring story in middle of nowhere and be able to shoot the scenes in middle of nowhere, right in middle of a such big animals like elephants, hippos, alligators, buffaloes and lions that only in Hollywood they could come up with a story line like that, less alone having wild animals as their actors. Amazing story, unbelievable screenplay that the whole family should watch this real documentary that if Pixar made it, they would have called it The Love of A Mother. My best wishes to Jouberts. I thank them for creating such an unbelievable masterpiece. Bravo, Bravo, Bravo.",N/A

I knew The Grey was going to be bad when (SPOILER ALERT) Liam Neeson, in the first fifteen seconds says, ""a summary killer,"" in describing what he does. I barely could pick up what he said, but there it was, yup, ""summary killer."" IMHO, one does not begin ones' movie with a difficult word like ""summary killer,"" within the first fifteen seconds. It's like WTF? WTF is a summary killer? Having a lit degree, yah, I know what it means. But mr. average movieguy? He turns to his girlfriend and says- ""what did he just say?"" She doesn't want to answer him, cuz she's busy trying to figure out WTF he just said and it goes on from there.Next, there's a delicious shot of ol' brother Liam lining up on a grey wolf that (SPOILER ALERT DELUXE) that just happens to beeline out of the forest, yup, I mean that sincerely, runs, straight out of concealing woods toward three men standing around an oil or gas pipeline. GOOD THING ol' Liam was there, READY, to dust that evil toad, his mean, lean killing machine hefted at his shoulder. And he does what must be done. Cuz, he knew, that Grey was gonna BEELINE out of the woods, spring over one hundred and fifty feet of open field and attack three grown MALE OIL PIPELINE WORKERS because, well, because he was houngry... But lucky ol' Liam was there, to save the pipeline workers.I guess the film deserves one star, because, as I watched it, I realized I had chores to do and, because of the depressing tone of this movie, I realized I had better get them done before some wolf did me in.I really wonder how many wolves are going to be killed as a result of this movie.",The Grey

1375046,"There are a lot of reviews here, much to read or consider.If you think that watching a new level of graphicly-bloody,-sexual violence  against women, or any victim in this sort of crime,- is part of a great movie, then skip this, because ""its a SPOILER.""After watching this movie I wish I saw a MUCH MORE CONCISE warning, any spoiler effect would have been greatly appreciated. I wish the warning said:""This movie contains violent, bloody, life-threatening torturous rape. The scenes are at a level that will be shocking to most observers. (based on comments by those who did not read the book, and were asked if the movie was 'cool' or 'intense' or had parts that were disturbing, etc., etc.)The screams alone are so difficult to hear. The most violent level of rape is enough to cause a physical revulsion not exactly common in R-rated movies to date.. I think I am not alone.  Gratuitous sex is a silly matter, after you see this horrid level of violence.A warning of 'Rape and Murder"" means little, after you must observe torture like this.Also I would like to have been offered,-""If you wish to SKIP this 'segment' of the movie, the actual minutes of this murderous-level of rape run From __?_(minute-time) To __?__Minute-time, should be avoided.I am sorry, but I did not write down which minutes are the horrid minutes involved. I could not go back to look again. As it began, I turned the volume off, tried to not look, letting silent tape run, and waited for it to end, and waited, for the ACTUAL MOVIE to continue.(This murder by rape easily 'could' result in a horribly, drawn-out death).For once, I think a squealer is not a bad thing, not here.I realize, that I am probably asking someone who is doubltless paid only to SELL THE MOVIE. That is not relevant to their 'title' or job description. The ""R- Rating' is a watered-down rating here. This is alone in its own, NEW field of vile violence.Angelina Jolie's incredible movie touched down on sex-crime violence, this one slams into it. I am pretty sure Dragon Tattoo, takes the 'gone way past what we need to see' {SICK PRIZE}.The drawn-out scene takes viewers into the highly illegal sextrade level of cruelty, where MURDER BY RAPE is sold on dvd's, to sell to the few who want to see this, and the victim indeed does- die.Is that what movie watchers expect or want? I think not.  I pray not.I truly doubt any one signs on to see this crap, and recall, many have NOT read the book. Many read the hype and dont see this crap coming.Maybe this type of torture is a 'common form of rape,'  but I have only heard of this level of violence.Still the movie does a tremendous job of drawing out WHAT RAPE REALLY IS.  If anyone can allow themselves to recall the horror they 'get' to observe here. Yes, maybe, rape will be taken more seriously by the many sharp viewers, and someday the punishment will meet the horrors of such crime.Stiil, I have a beyond-vivid imagination and know enough-without pictures, enactment. The whole drawn out rage and destruction enforced against a female, or any victim of violent sex crime. The victim is instantly an obvious survivor, from the start of the movie.  We know something really bad has happened to her. We care deeply for her, its immediate. But, this drawn-out nauseating offense is just not integral to the movie. Maybe the younger crowd will show their bravery by discussing it. That is what may be 'hip.'But I hope all viewers are sickened and horrified, as we are humans, we have too much humanity to want to sit thru this. Its not an thrill ride for me. Its far beyond, and below, horrid.50 million copies sold, in 48 countries.  How many loved reading it? Most, and I think I would.  How many looked forward to SEEING that scene?  Maybe some, in small doses.I wonder how many wanted this sent to be SEEN,  by unknown viewers, all over the world?  - For ALL ages to 'stumble into.' - We know that Ratings dont protect young people.  We do, or we try to.  We dont succeed always.Our votes for what is ok to include, still can be spoken out,-for, or against. Freedom (artistic, like this) can hurt our young people, and the rest of us too. Its a big world, many opionions. And many want to prove they are open to 'anything on screen.'

Great descriptions of what parts of the body should be relaxed, which muscles supporting the move, isn't always present in Peggy's commentary/instruction.

1427322,"This 1972 - 1981 series is a genuine classic.  It is one of those family shows that has timeless messages and an optimistic theme.  I enjoyed the series on the Family Channel and later the Hallmark and Inspiration Channels and finally lucked into this series at a very reasonable cost online.  Each character was well fleshed out, well drawn out.  The Baldwin Sisters, although tragic figures provided a bit of a giggle with their innocent naivete in re their papa's ""Recipe,"" which they thought was an elixir but was actually moonshine whiskey.  While I never cared for Cora-Beth Godsey, wife of Ike Godsey, who ran the General store, I thought she, too was a tragic figure.  She was prone to ""putting on airs"" and, to quote another fictitious character Archie Bunker of ""All in the Family"" fame, Cora-Beth's airs were ""like putting lace on a bowling ball.""  The large family of 7 children plus grandparents and the work ethic during hard times is one of heartwarming inspiration.  You can't help but love the characters (in my case, I was not overly fond of Cora-Beth) and the taut, well thought out story lines and extraordinary acting.Each one of the young stars of that show has exemplified a successful life reflective of the show in which they became famous.  Kami Cotler, the youngest Walton child is now a principal of a middle school and blessed with 2 sons.  Richard Thomas has been in many movies as well as Broadway.  In 1995 he starred in the outstanding TV movie, ""The Christmas Box.""  He has been blessed with triplet daughters.  The others have found their niche and each one of those characters have also found a place in the collective hearts of many.  I wish there were more shows like this that are family oriented and speak to love; dedication; a good work ethic and resilience.  This is a collection worth having.I love the way the show closed, with various members of the household talking to one another and closing on the requisite ""Good night, John-Boy.""  The show is like hot Ovaltine on a cold night, a real comfort.  It is also a nice way to close your evening.",N/A

I have collected 10 of the 13 DVDs in the series and I just discovered them a year ago!Peter has broken down this workout very well so I will just add my thoughts.  Both workouts are very good and thorough.  You work hard but there is no dread factor.  I really like the fact that I can get a great workout, whether it's upper or lower body in just a half hour.  I used to exercise more consistently but suffered from burn out and just stopped.  These workouts have helped me get back on track and I enjoy exercising again!I really liked the bandwork in the lower body segment, I was feeling it and right away.  I normally don't work those muscles like that so they were really firing.  Thankfully by the time you have had your fill of the band work it's over, though it is repeated later on in the workout.  I do find myself modifying the lower body section a bit.  Kelly is known for adding unique variations to tried and true exercises.  They don't always work for me personally though.  So I just modify a little bit, for example I just do a static lunge in place of th leg press, a squat foot tap inward or squat heel lift in place of the squat/knee inversion, and instead of the deadlift/rock I just do a 4-4 count deadlift.  I do the other lower body exercises as presented.  I really like the side lunge exercise, I have never seen that in any other workout.The upper body workout is very good also.  There are only a few exercises for each muscle group, but each are repeated and everything is hit well.  A lot is accomplished in 30 minutes.  I found myself doing the waist exercises without weights though, just a personal preference.  Kelly does use weights for these but I skipped it.Once again, there are premix options for those to choose from, they have already been laid out nicely in the previous review.Lauren is also back with modifications, she does a great job as always.  As does Kelly, I really enjoy exercising with her, she just my speed and motivates me to keep at it.

1442382,"The latest fantasy epic from micro-budget studio The Asylum and director Mark Atkins (PRINCESS OF MARS, DRAGONQUEST) is probably their best genre effort yet. DRAGON CRUSADERS (2011) is a lively and exciting mini-epic that benefits from a reasonably original story, a good cast, and gorgeous Welsh location work.A small band of outlaw Knights Templar are accidentally cursed with a magic spell that will turn them - one at a time - into vicious, bat-winged gargoyles. The only hope of breaking the curse is to journey to the mountain stronghold of an evil wizard who not only controls a flock of fire-breathing dragons, but has the ability to become one himself.With DRAGON CRUSADERS, Atkins fulfills the promise I perceived in his earlier fantasy epic, MERLIN & THE WAR OF THE DRAGONS, with a beautifully shot, well-paced, sword & sorcery adventure. Returning to many of the same picturesque and appropriately Medieval locations seen in MERLIN, and once again employing some very talented Welsh actors, CRUSADERS - shot in 14 days on a shoestring budget - plays and looks far more expensive than it is. Atkins' cinematography and editing are both very slick, and his screenplay is perfectly tailored to make the most of his limited resources.The cast is uniformly solid. Dylan Jones (who previously appeared in various supporting roles in other Asylum productions, including MERLIN) is appropriately stoic and heroic as the leader of the knights, and handles the swordplay and riding with aplomb (the multi-talented Jones was also the horse master for the film). Sexy stuntwoman Cecily Fay makes a convincing (if tiny!) warrior woman, and Merlin himself, Simon Lloyd-Roberts, is memorable as the youngest of the cursed knights. Really, though, everyone in the cast is surprisingly good.Production-wise, the costumes and props look fine, the digital creature effects appear to be somewhat more polished than usual, and Atkins makes terrific use of some truly impressive - and authentic-looking - locations. Composer Chris Ridenhour once again rises to the occasion, with another sweeping, epic musical score.The Asylum DVD presents DRAGON CRUSADERS with a crystal-clear, rock-solid 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer. The viewer's audio options are 5.1 Surround or 2.0 stereo. Supplemental material consists of a ""Making Of"" featurette, a gag reel, and an assortment of trailers for other Asylum titles.I must say I was pleasantly surprised with DRAGON CRUSADERS. We all know that I'm a pushover for fantasy material, but my expectations were far exceeded by Atkins' accomplished film. If you're an aficionado of dungeons and dragons and mystical tales of heroic deering-do, I suggest at least giving this one a rental - or checking it out when it makes its inevitable SyFy Channel showings.

983361,"Other reviewers have already detailed the story plot, so I'll just give you my opinion of this action thriller.  Wow!  The action is non-stop right from the beginning, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The bad guys are so vile you really don't want to so much as give them a bad look if you saw them on the street for they would not think twice about taking you out.  Acting by all characters is superb, believable, and realistic, even by those who play minor roles, and there is no stupid dialogue which in other movies simply serves as filler.  Some reviewers have criticized the ending as being too Hollywood---whatever that means---but I think it is the only ending that makes sense for viewers who watch movies to be entertained and who want to feel satisfied at the end, even if in real life things may not work out that way.

1288977,"Christopher Smith is definitely a director to watch. TRIANGLE takes what could have been a tired premise and draws it out to (and beyond) its logical conclusion. Melissa George stars as a young mother who takes a boat trip with some friends. When the boat capsizes, they take shelter on a seemingly abandoned cruise ship, and soon discover they're not alone.I thought I was ahead of the movie, successfully figuring out ""the twist,"" but wasn't prepared for what came after. Smith's film has a premise that demands certain things to be true, and he follows his own rule to the letter. By the end, he's executed the premise with impeccable conviction, letting the movie wrap and twist around itself far more than I would have guessed. It's remarkably effective. The final act is an extraordinary payoff, giving us a sisyphean tragedy that actually felt complete.I've been recommending this to friends and they've all enjoyed it just as much as I did.

Turns out that the woman had been let go from the bakery some weeks before that, without the bakery's top management knowing about it. An Israeli reporter turns the story into one of ""inhuman indifference"" and the company's HR manager is asked to look into it. At that point it looked like the movie might have a political take on the suicide bombings. Eventually, the company decides to pay for taking the woman's body back to Romania for a proper funeral. The movie then takes a compltely different take, and it becomes a road movie on how the woman's body is eventually taken back to the village of her mother, deep into off the beaten track in Romania. I don't want to spoil how it all plays out, you'll just have to see it for yourself.As strange as this movie was, I found myself somehow mesmorized as it kept developing. I picked this up, literally knowing nothing about it, but the ""Film Movement"" stamp of approval was good enough for me, and I was once again rewarded. Beware, this is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are into foreign movies and like to take a chance on some unheard of movie, I readily recommend this.

The kid wants Kentucky Fried Chicken and granny feeds him a boiled chicken. (She goes to the market, buys a live chicken, kills it and cooks it.) The kid, when he is hungry enough, eats it.

1324430,"THOR is what my idea of what a comic book movie should be - big, colorful, loud, a little bit corny at times, but hugely entertaining throughout.Kenneth Branagh's unabashedly colorful and fun take on the material offers memorable production design from Bo Welch, with sets and costumes that look like they just flew off the Marvel pages (I don't think I've seen anything like the Asgard scenes since ""Flash Gordon"", with plenty of rousing action to match.Chris Hemsworth is undeniably charismatic as Odin's son, who is banished to Earth by his father (Anthony Hopkins) after putting the kingdom of Asgard in trouble with his callous actions. Unlike some other, pre-fab Aussie leading men we've seen of late (Sam Worthington, anyone?), Hemsworth is the real deal, effortlessly navigating his way through the material with the right dash of arrogance and empathy (like many of the Marvel films, there's ultimately a moral to this story). Action, humor, and fantasy all come together as Thor falls for a mere mortal grad student (Natalie Portman, so much more appealing than she was in the Star Wars prequels) who becomes infatuated with our muscle-bound hero, while Hopkins doesn't just cash the check as Odin and other roles are satisfyingly filled by the likes of Stellan Skaarsgard (Portman's professor boss), Kat Dennings (her friend), Idris Elba (Asgard's gatekeeper) and Tom Hiddelston as Loki, Thor's troubled brother who we're about to see a good deal more of in next summer's ""The Avengers.""Speaking of that much-anticipated super-hero team mash-up, the lead-in material to that picture is incorporated into the story here far more organically than ""Iron Man 2"" - Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye makes a very brief appearance but people who don't know who he is won't be sitting there, thinking that the movie has stopped dead to incorporate references to ""The Avengers.""The pacing is a little bit odd at times as the movie flips between the Asgard and Earth sequences, and if anything, could have used more character development (it's cut lean under 2 hours), but overall I was very much entertained. This is colorful, romantic genre entertainment with a dynamic Patrick Doyle score that's the most satisfying work I've heard from the composer since his Halcyon days of the mid `90s.Paramount has brought ""Thor"" to BD in a number of different flavors including a Blu-Ray/3-D Blu-Ray/DVD copy. The HD image on the Blu-Ray is expectedly strong (1080p AVC encoded widescreen), though I wasn't so crazy about the use of 3-D with the picture: more often than not it dims the movie's vivid cinematography, offering only occasional ""depth of field"" type of effects that are really noticeable. The DTS MA sound is strong on all the renditions, while extras include 24 minutes of deleted scenes (some of which would've helped the pacing) in HD, brief featurettes (there's a Patrick Doyle interview that runs barely two minutes), a commentary from Branagh and some connecting featurettes designed to sell ""The Avengers,"" though little in the way of footage from the much-anticipated super-hero match-up.",N/A
872419,"I'd bought this a couple of years ago, and I believe I started watching the outtake portion, out of curiosity started with the Bonnie Raitt interview, wondering what 'by what stretch of the imagination could she be tied to the Rutles.'  The answer was ""she can't.""  I recall childish sexual references in her ""interview"", supposedly intended as humorous.  I'd had enough, and started the actual production.  Interviewer running to keep up with the camera pulling away.  I think I found that funny the first time in the first film.  Retreaded, it only qualified as tedious.  I don't remember how much further I got before I had to stop it due to it not being funny or entertaining.I wasn't as fond of ""Archeology"" as I was of the ""All You Need Is Cash"" soundtrack from 1978.  The reason being that with ""Archeology"", you weren't so much reminded of a Beatles song or song by the music, as knowing exactly which song was being parodied by the musical riffs stolen from the Beatles music.  The music was more original in AYNIC.  A perfect example of this is to compare the version of ""Shangri-la"" on Neil Innes' ""Takes Off"" album to the one on ""Archeology"".  The former is very Beatlesque, like a Beatles song that was never released.  The latter is a case of ""OK, this bit was taken from this Beatles song, and that bit was taken from that Beatles song.""I tried last night to watch ""Rutles 2"" again.  I went to scene selection, and picked the last offering on the first page, regarding the ""Rutle's marriages"".  Barry Wom 'forgot about his wedding and played a gig instead?'  This is plausible?  This is humor?Did you like the interviewers competing for the microphone in Monty Python?  Well, you get to see it again, only re-done badly.Did you think the trousers joke was funny in the original?  You'll get to laugh at it again over and over as you hear it many more times.Think the shagging jokes were funny in Austin Powers?  Laugh again as the lame choice of interviewees all concur that the Rutles and rock and roll are all about shagging.After about 5 minutes, I had to stop the DVD.

337372,"Oh, my heavens, this is a gorgeous film to own. The film was nominated for Best Picture (the year Amadeus won) and was David Lean's return to cinema after a passage of a number of years (he had been very hurt by the critical reviews of ""Ryan's Daughter,"" fourteen years earlier).The clarity is excellent, and the colors...well, let me tell you, the colors are breathtaking! Lean has arranged so many magnificent sights all in one film, all the while telling the story of a young woman (Judy Davis) on her first trip to India. The audio is Dolby TrueHD and shines throughout.There are several excellent shorts that have actors and others discussing the making of the film, though I think they could easily have been edited all into one documentary (this is in standard definition, by the way).Commentary is produced by Richard Goodwin, one of the producers of the film, and while it is informative, it is also very dry because Goodwin speaks in a very unemotional, monotone droning voice.The Blu-ray also comes with a picture in picture capability where facts about the filming and British/East Indian differences in real life pop up at different moments in the film. However, instead of being a small box in the corner of the screen, the facts pop as full screen and the picture of the movie is momentarily reduced to the box to the side. When the fact is finished playing, it automatically leaves the screen and the full movie image returns.All in all, this is a Blu-ray worth owning and an excellent demo disc to show people coming over to see what your Blu-ray is really about.P.S. -- When you play this film, do not be surprised that the image does not reach to both edges of your HDTV. Lean deliberately shot it this way because he was thinking of the transition to TV.",N/A

His search for romance is urged on by his son, who notes that his father appears lonely and downhearted.Hence the introduction of the father's film producer friend.  The two characters stage a film with dozens of eligible young women ostensibly auditioning for the lead role.  Meanwhile, of course, the father has ulterior motives in meeting and interviewing the ladies.When the father meets the leading lady, there is an instant chemistry between the two and they hit it off, going out to dinner, spending the weekend together, meeting her stepfather, etc.  She has a troubled past, including abuse and the shattering of her dreams as a ballerina, but has resolved many of her issues with her abusive stepfather and now apparently cares for him at her residence.Finally, she comes back to his house, where things get off on the wrong foot when the young lady introduces the father to her amateur acupuncture skills.  This is also the moment in the movie when the young lady meets the son and there is definitely some friction between the two.The end of the movie is unclear, but I am optimistic that these two lovebirds will make it work out in the end, despite their differences.  They may have some issues to resolve and possibly some couples counseling, but you just know that love conquers all and they'll stay together.",N/A
73632,"Released 8 months after Patrick Swayze's death, this new Limited Keepsake Edition is the overall best release, especially for a fan like me. To start with, the twenty-five page Keepsake Book was beautifully filled with pictures, quotes, bios of the actors, a pop quiz, lyrics to the Kellerman's Anthem, and a forward from writer and co-producer Eleanor Bergstein. More pictures are featured on the case when you open to find the two discs. The opening menu takes you back to the movie before you ever hit play.On Disc 1 are the basic features such as Set Up, Scene Selections, and Special Features, but while the second disc has more don't think these special features aren't worth watching or the commentaries aren't worth listening to because they are. You can watch the movie with or without the commentary, but there are two different commentaries and both are great to listen to. You can also watch the movie with the trivia track that has interesting tidbits about the movie that pop onto the screen as you watch the movie. The special features are interesting, especially finding out more details about how they made the film in Kellerman's: Reliving the Locations of the Film. The Rhythm of Dancing is a documentary with Patrick Swayze that he did before his death. Dirty Dancing: The Phenomenon is more about how one movie became one of the biggest movies of all time.On Disc 2 it features so many extras that you'll spend hours going through every feature from the Dance Sequences to the Tributes, which made me cry. When you hit In Memoriam it features a lovely montage remembering Jerry Orbach, Jack Weston, Max Cantor, Emile Ardolino, and of course Patrick Swayze. They feature three separate tributes to Jerry Orbach (narrated by Kelly Bishop). A tribute to Patrick Swayze as told by brother Donny Swayze, wife Lisa Niemi, Eleanor Bergstein, Kenny Ortega, and Miranda Garrison. A tribute to Emile Ardolino as told by Eleanor Bergstein, Miranda Garrison, Kenny Ortega, with Jennifer Grey, and Luis Rodriguez. Another feature Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze is a must see documentary Patrick Swayze did before his death. Three music videos are featured on this disc: I've Had The Time of My Life, Hungry Eyes, and She's Like The Wind which are definitely take you back to 1987.

So I got this for my daughter, who loves show musicals.  Alas, it simply did not translate well into cinema.  There are many problems with the production.  The singing, acting, and - in the way that hollywood makes things so stupidly explicit - the plot.  Instead of a glimpse, with many things implied but never completely spelled out in spite of the rawness of the bway script, the film turns it into a lousy melodrama and takes the characters just that little bit too far as a way of implying depth.  For that, it was nearly terrible.  What the production did convey extremely well - hence 3 and not 2 stars - was the dance.  It made me want to dance and I was in awe of the talent there, which may be one reason why the actors were largely unknowns and, frankly, so bad at everything else.  I did enjoy talking about it with my daughter and it is toned down somewhat.If you want to re-experience the bway show, don't get this.

56381,"The second of Oliver Stone's three films on the subject of Vietnam, this one stars Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic, a wounded war vet who comes home to discover the grateful reception he expected isn't waiting for him. Though the film is closely based on a true story, it also functions as a rather obvious metaphor for the rapid transition of America's public attitude from the happy-go-lucky family values of the '50s to the conspiratorial uncertainty of the early '70s. At the time this was something of a reach for Cruise, who was only just starting to branch out into serious roles, and the strong performance opened up new horizons for his career. His acting shines, especially in the dark, depressing pits to which his character eventually sinks, but the storyline could use some smoothing. Almost overnight Kovic's attitudes about his country spin 180-degrees, swapping one extreme perspective for another just minutes after he's shouted down his younger brother over the kitchen table for doing the same thing. An awkward almost-love-story is shoehorned into his character arc, then disappears around the middle of the picture and never resurfaces. It's a passionate rallying cry for the cause of the railroaded, confused Vietnam vets who were punished for doing what they thought was the right thing, but despite several strong performances from its cast it's needlessly long and routinely uneven.",N/A

3537,"I have the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version of Jane Eyre, the George C. Scott/Susannah York version of Jane Eyre, the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version of Jane Eyre and the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version of Jane Eyre--yes, it's one of my favorite movies. Without a doubt, Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester is head and shoulders above Timothy Dalton as well as Toby Stephens. I do like Toby Stephens but Ciaran Hinds' facial expressions, his emotional portrayal of Rochester is unparalleled.  Samantha Morton is a wonderful Jane, plain yet with an inner beauty, stoic and strong, unemotional on the surface but in love with Mr. Rochester.  She was the ideal actress for this role. I was very disappointed with the portrayal of Jane in the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version, for one thing Zelah Clark is so short compared to Dalton, I couldn't watch the movie without thinking she looked like a child in height yet older in her face than Dalton--it was very distracting for me.  She also does not have the range of acting and emotion Samantha Morton gives in her performance--Clark is very bland compared to Morton.  As much as I like Timothy Dalton, he isn't Rochester. The George C. Scott/Susannah York version is good, I really liked George C. Scott as Rochester but not as much as Hinds. Susannah York comes closer to Samantha Morton as Jane than any of the other versions but Samantha Morton still excels in this part..There are many comments about the Hinda/Morton version not closely following the book, I was more interested in the movie than the book, if I purely wanted the book, I would read that and not watch the movie. I've seen the Hinds/Morton Jane Eyre many times, each time I see more and more pure acting ability from Hinds than any other actor in this role, his facial expressions portray as much as his spoken lines. Hinds in excellent in portraying the gruffness and hard edge of Rochester yet tenderness in his passion and love for Jane--Hinds brings Rochester to life. The last scenes of this movie with Hinds' and Morton's recital of love and devotion for each other are nothing short of astounding.  Hinds' tears were real as he poured out his heart to Jane that he was no longer worthy of her, how could she love him now as a wounded blind man unable to care for her--amazing acting on Hinds' part.  The same was true for Morton as Jane, her tears flowed easily and with such realism as she promised to never leave him again, she had returned to him forever.Of the other versions of Jane Eyre, Toby Stephens as Rochester would be my next choice, even over Scott, but as good as he is, Stephens honestly doesn't hold a candle to Hinds as Rochester. I particularly missed the passion and pure emotion in the last scenes with Stephens and Wilson, it was weak compared to Hinds and Morton. If I want authenticity, perhaps I'll go to the Stephens/Wilson version, for pure enjoyment and richness of acting in a love story, it's Hinds and Morton hands down.  I would have given this movie 4 stars if based totally on the story, but I've given this version 5 stars based on the rich acting of both the lead actors (especially Hinds), they are wonderful.",N/A

Jennifer in this piece plays the role different than i expect and i was thrown off at first but then i saw where the drama was going. At first we are introduced to budding novelist with the Salinger name of the classic american nover cathcher in the rye,probably the most well known,though short,novels of modern america. This type of character which not only is a source of drama but evokes commentary throughout is interesting,and he leads the character into a series of scenes adultery(where she is neveremotionally/sensitively involved,which is why the director expends explicit scenes showcasing them). The film shoots like a play,ideas of being cuckoldedand the dreary effects of urbanization around the focal point of a walmart typeestablishment,which like in the novel Dickens Hard Times wears down on the characters as they become increasingly alienated and have little inner lifeor values,just parts of the environment,except the male character which shows some life but is done away with at the end and is thought to be crazy(orperhaps too sane). The one part of the film i did like was the attempt toshow christian revival as a counterpoint to what's draining much of life inthe modern world...but it never really gets anywhere and the characters dontseem that interested,and the spouse of Jennifer seems antagonized by the nazarene character and his wife's feelings for him,that's what occupies thesecrudish male characters their wives personal feelings and bonds to other men,which they can never quite deal with,and their is good drama about a romanceamong friends. A dark comedy of modern life,bringing up old themes in thefictional world of st catharines a small towm representing small towncharacters,the one star,and the inability of the characters to impose changeon their environment,and they become sticks and driven like the wind by theirstimulus-response type reaction not only to sex, but everything,the director orwriter comments on characters with little mental life,sensualist at thecore and completely conditioned by their environment, making them what they are.Of all the actresses films,and i'm one of those old fashioned critics wholikes virtuous females not succumbing so much to their environs and havingsome inner resilience,for that reason i like this role least,although heracting is good and so is the film,it has a depressing aura around  it true tolife though it is. All to true...the characters resemble all too frankly whatis wrong in our own haunted worlds,spectors and cuckolds like the holloweenimagery,and our failure is that they so dominate our worlds to the neglect and solace of the revival spirit which is quenched like all redeeming values in thisexcellent art like film.

1553340,"Though I would've preferred a metal tin (see Justice League Complete Series)for the outer box, a decent enough cardboard material is used. The lone Amazon pic shows the first two of the four different sets of Angels on the left side of the outer box (in all their Silver Convention glory). The right side pleasantly shows the latter two sets of angels. Each of the four inside flaps are dedicated to one of the four sets of Angels, fully covered with photos from that phase. Most of which are from the indidivual season sets. A few new pictures along with each Angel's name appears on the flaps that cover each spindle. Which brings me to the main issue ... the two spindles which hold both stacks of discs. Though not as bad I first thought, a series so great as this deserves the five-star treatment and not some budget packaging. The discs seem somewhat secure in the cheap plastic holders but the inevitability of scratching will probably occur after the first removal. Which causes me to rethink ditching my individual season sets. Because even though I loathe thin cases, they're still better than spindles. There's also no booklet, just an episode list/insert inside the box. The discs of Seasons 1-4 all seem identical to the ones from the indidivual sets, with no added special features or remastering. Also, no special mention of Season Five's debut on dvd and the artwork on those discs are basically the photo from the box (which also appears on Amazon's CA : Season Five homemade item page). Cosmetically speaking, this box rocks but because of the disc housing inside and lack of booklet, the set gets a low rating. Word to the wise, wait for the individual Season Five.

This move caused quite a stir at the time for various reasons.  One of them was that Wallis left her second husband for him and she was an American.  She and this guy were celebrities, both immensely loved, vilified and ostracized by society all at the same time.  Who better to tell that story than someone like Madonna who is one of those rare people who has lived a life that most of the world will never have or experience.The movie paints a portrait of this love affair that took place juxtaposed with another story in modern day time revolving around another woman, Wally Winthrop.  Wally is a fictional character who is an abusive relationship and fixates on this love story between Wallis and the Prince.  She fantasizes and obsesses over it to the point of hanging out in a museum that is dedicated to the historical artifacts of Wallis Simpson.  The subplot could've stood on its own in another film, but not this one.  The way the movie jumps from the subplot to the affair between the Prince and Wallis is disjointed and confusing.  It also stalls the momentum.  The same was done in the Meryl Streep film, Julie & Julia.  Focus on the main public figure and avoid creating a fictitious subplot as it rarely works.W.E. does have a nice sleepy art-house feel to it and it will probably be more popular with Europeans who seems to have an appreciation for this genre.  I can't see very many Americans liking this film and then you have those who will simply ban, knock and criticize this movie after discovering Madonna is the Director.  You would never have guessed it watching this as it was pretty good.The movie is watchable and the attention to detail with the sets, costume design and actors is top notch.  Aside from the disjointed subplot, the movie gets so lost in the detail to the point where scenes drag longer than they need to.  All in all I was still pleasantly surprised as the movie picked up about mid way through up until the finish line.",W.E.

1503344,"The Royal Ballet's homage to Frederick Ashton is a DVD definitely worth owning, if not just for the stunning video of 'Les Patineurs' and 'Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan'. However, the rest of the DVD isn't as interesting.'Les Patineurs', starring Steven McRae, with music by Giacomo Meyerbeer, is everything an ideal Ashton ballet should be: simple, elegant, technical, and full of nuances.The story is a simple one, about 'the ice skaters', and all of their intricate and beautiful patterns. Paired with 'Les Patineurs' are three videos of the principal dancers and soloists in rehearsal, where they mope about the difficulty of the steps (something I wouldn't recommend watching).The next ballet on the DVD is 'Divertissements', which is a collection of elegant pas de deux and solos. Unfortunately, the majority of them are in the same, melancholy mood, as pretty as they are. The Sleeping Beauty - Awakening Pas de Deux isn't very interesting, though the stars of the Royal Ballet, Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope, dance. The Devil's Holiday Pas de Deux is done beautifully, with beautiful lines by Laura Morera, though it's in the same, extremely lyrical and slightly dull state. The Devil's Holiday Variation is in this same semi-dull state, though with great masculinity and power, by Viacheslav Samodurov. The Thas Pas de Deux is also very lyrical, with gorgeous lines by Mara Galeazzi. Then comes Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan; stunning. With a piano onstage, and Tamara Rojo as Isadora, the performance is transformed into something unreal. Rojo shockingly turns into Duncan, and with every waltz to the music of Brahm, she shows a different aspect of Duncan's performances. Five Brahms Waltzes is yet another reason to own this DVD. Then comes the Voices of Spring Pas de Deux. On other dancers, this pas de deux looks beautiful, but here, with Leanne Benjamin and Carlos Acosta, it looks slightly clunky and heavy; although technically done well. The most important thing in this ballet is Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan, something no one is likely to forget.The last ballet on the DVD is 'Sc&egrave;nes de Ballet', starring Miyako Yoshida and Ivan Putrov, to the music of Igor Stravinsky. The music here is beautiful, not the music of the typical Balanchine-Stravinsky collaborations, it is much more harmonious. Choreographically, the ballet is dull. It's just a showpiece, to see how many pirouettes can be done in synchronization, and how many double tours can be done by the same man in a row. Personally, I don't find these kinds of works interesting. Though the dancers are all stunning (especially Putrov), this is all like a dull, more colorful version of 'Etudes', but without the catchiness, spark, and (vague) story.Though some of the works on this DVD are dull and over-lyrical, I recommend this DVD just for these exquisite recordings of 'Les Patineurs' and 'Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan'. These two works are unforgettable; and are worth owning to ballet fans, and especially fans of Ashton's choreographies.",Patineurs & Divertissements & Scenes de Ballet
1080761,"There were plenty of times where this was a 2 star film and only a few when it was four stars but overall it comes in as a 3 minus. The idea is interesting, Viking conflict with American Indians but it's done in such an over the top manner, any historical point is lost. The Vikings are dressed like Fantasy figures and act with no logic what-so-ever. There is lots of gore and it's all done in the darkest of shades so that it often looks like night-time. I kept thinking that there was clearly a budget of sorts available and that it was a shame that it was spent making a sort of Dark Ages 'teen slasher'. While most of it is cliched (as much as the film defies genre classification) and sometimes almost stupid in terms of believability, there are a few surprises and I guess it is generally adequate for killing time when there is nothing else available.",N/A
1433262,"Long, long, long time Gundam fan here, [...].  I have the honor of being born the same year (actually one week before) the first Gundam series premiered in Japan.  I have been a huge fan since I was a wee tyke.  I was very impressed with Gundam Seed and Gundam 00 (we won't mention Gundam Seed Destiny which was pretty much a nearly exact repeat of Seed, just with a few new faces).  I actually hesitate to give this three stars, because I think that is too high of a rating.  But being that it still holds true to the Gundam roots, I'll keep it at 3.To give a little back story to the production; Seiji Mizushima, the regular director of Gundam 00 and Fullmetal Alchemist was brought in to write and direct this film.  Sunrise gave him license to do what he thought best as long as he kept true to the anti-war message of the series and used the characters that were still around at the end of the series.  Perhaps Sunrise forgot that Bones let him have free reign for a Fullmetal Alchemist film and we were given the awfulness that was Conqueror of Shamballa.In this film, a ship from Jupiter is headed towards a crash landing on Earth.  The new Earth Federation forces destroy it, but fragments crash to Earth and begin taking over machines, trying to kill anyone who has Quantum brain waves.  Ala Maximum Overdrive (terrible 80s flick with killer machines - led by Optimus Prime - I mean a big, killer 18 wheeler).  Then we see a zombie version of an early Innovator (who looks like Ribbons).  Then we find out that the fragments actually contained alien life forms from Jupiter.  They get pissed and amass a fleet to conquer Earth.  First wave is stopped and so a second, meaner fleet comes from Jupiter towards Earth.  Since they are seemingly brainless, all they do is kill.  But wait, they're misunderstood and all we need is Setsuna to talk with them, then all will be well.The problem is that this film never really becomes cohesive.  One of the brilliant aspects of ANY and EVERY Gundam series is that it comes together nicely in the end.  Everything ends up weaving together.  The characters end up pivotal to the story.  The viewer roots for them.  In this film we never really get that feeling of 'everything coming together'.  I'll elaborate in a second.The second main issue, which stems from the first issue is the lack of a central villain.  Gundam has ALWAYS featured insanely maniacal and really interesting villains.  From Char to Rau Le Creuset (whose family was in the pots and pans business - Le Creuset! - but j/k).  In this series I actually thought Shaman might end up as the 'villain' but alas... instead we have the Borg like metal lifeforms which seem to act as a hive mind and don't really communicate.  At least not to the extent to where the viewer gets treated to insane monologues like Rau or Ribbons give as they try to eradicate all life.  The lack of entertaining villains is a huge minus for me.The other issue with the 'villain' from this film is that when your favorite supporting characters start dying, you think ""well crap, they outlasted the Innovators and survived against insane villains such as Ali-Al-Saachez but they got owned by unexciting little metal cones"".  And what's even a greater transgression is when some of these characters show up then get killed right away.  It really does lessen the impact of the death of a character you knew for several dozen episodes of the main season.  In fact, we hear that over 70% of the fleet is taken out by the midway of the battle.  And against little metal aliens.  The most interesting part is when the aliens actually start forming Gundam shaped entities to better combat the Federation.But most of the battles consist of hundreds of CG cones following a Gundam in a row, looking a lot like the line of seagulls from Finding Nemo chasing a fish.  When there are multiple mobile suits on screen and hundreds of these aliens, the battles form a mish mash of lasers, streams of aliens, and explosions.  I would have preferred the battles to run more like the amazing Zaft vs Earth Forces battles in SEED (like the one where Flay's dad gets it) or the battles between Celestial Being and the A-Laws in 00.  Even the finale battle in 00 was watchable, despite the high number of objects.I won't spoil what happens, but the ending is kind of disappointing, though if you roll through the credits you get the anti-war message.  Which is actually printed on screen.  Something like ""Peace cannot be maintained through force, but only by understanding"".  I loved the message, I just wish that I had enjoyed getting there a bit more.The mobile suit designs are hit and miss.  Celestial Being's suits are rather lackluster.  The idea of the 'rifle bits' for Lockon's new suit was good, but the weird floating wing was odd.  Hallelujah's Gundam was interesting with the double cockpit, but it was a boxy version of Kyrios and Arios.  Setsuna gets 00 for most of the series, and his new suit looks like a copy of Exia with a small backpack.  It seems the more creative suits are being designed for Gundam AGE (though not character design apparently - zing!).The intro song is amazing.  I would expect nothing less from UVERworld.  Then ending song is... eh.  It seems the singer rushes the song to cram in too many syllables.  But there is a pretty good insert song near the end of the series.  I did enjoy that.Now it seems I am bashing the film, but I'm not completely.  It is still an entertaining film, albeit it deviates from the 'style' of Gundam.  It does remind me quite a bit of what the director did with the Fullmetal film, just going off on a weird tangent.  Perhaps a plot with dissidents planning to overthrow the Federation government and acquiring a new Gundam (piloted by an evil and maniacal Innovator) would have been interesting.  Hell, they could have cloned an evil Aeolia Schenberg and put him in a new Gundam and I would have been more impressed.  It was just hard to watch my favorite characters battling a lackluster enemy.I do also understand that the message was about gaining 'understanding' with beings completely different than humans.  But by the end of the film I didn't care anymore.  The 'villains' were so lackluster that as a viewer I just wanted them all dead.  I didn't want understanding.Oh, by the way, for the 'misunderstood life form' style anime, Eureka Seven pulls it off PERFECTLY.All in all a decent Gundam flick with plenty of action but very little plot.  As a sequel to Gundam 00 it fails on many levels.  It seemed to drag down the high we all had when Celestial Being destroyed Ribbons and the false Innovators.  Perhaps this director should stick to directing series and stay out of the feature length animated film segment.  I feel that might be best.  But if you liked Gundam 00, you might want to watch it.  If you would hate to see a few good characters get killed in silly battles then you might not want to watch it.----Update: I just read Ender's Game, and this movie seems to have borrowed liberally from that novel.

The story-line is simple, a meteor crashes in a small farming town in the US and releases an alien that proceeds to take over humans.  Combining ideas from the Blob, the Alien franchise, and the Living Dead zombie movies, the final product is part comedy, part action, and part gore.  Though classified as horror, this movie is closer to a B-grade science fiction flick as the level of scariness is below that of the Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street franchises.  The special effects are believable due to them being low key.  The dialogue is good, and is probably the best part of the movie as the various characters respond in all sorts of ways when confronted by the slithering aliens.

1509912,"Drive. Refn.Refn borrows some highly stylized visual elements from Michael Mann's oevre ('Manhunter'). However I believe the largest contribution to this film does belong to Refn, and is the authentic product of Scandinavian cinema and television.This element is: 'slow-moving character study of brooding protagonists harboring an inner dark side'. The dialogue here is the opposite of Seinfeld: few things are articulated, voice tone and facial expression are of great importance to understanding the character's nuances of emotion. In some ways this taciturn method of delivery mimics how people express themselves in Scandinavian societies. The fascination with brooding, taciturn characters and the portrayal of bleakness and foreboding - the 'inner darkness' - means that these films would be most appealing to those who relate psychologically to these characters.This is the reason for the film's 'slowness', and if the viewer cannot hook into the meaning of this slow-pacedness, they may assume that nothing is happening. To my mind, 'Drive' submerges us in an experience more profoundly than any contemporary film. Since I value this aspect of the experience, I don't take issue with those aspects of the film which would not withstand intellectual scrutiny.",N/A
369512,"This polarizing Oliver Stone movie really got the MPAA ratings board in an uproar when it was scheduled for release.  They assigned it an NC-17 tag due to the excessive violence, gore, sex, profanity and the like.  It was eventually cut enough to get an R but remained highly controversial.  Critics pretty much lined up on the side of brilliant satire or loathsome glorification of violence.  Here we get the unrated version and even a perverse cut scene involving Ashley Judd (special features).Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are a couple of misfits in love with each other and the power of killing people in cold blood.  They were both abused as children as we learn in flashbacks and a sit-com (complete with laugh track) fantasy.  I guess Stone and his writers (David Veloz for the script and Quentin Tarantino for the story) put this in to make the natural born killers somewhat sympathetic.  What makes this film different from a similarly violent ""True Romance"" which came out a year earlier, is that many if not most of the victims are random and completely innocent in ""NBK.""Satire involves humor, often subtle but there are some over-the-top moments that strike that cord.  For example the fantasy sit-com which involves the laugh track responding enthusiastically when Mallory's father (real comedian Rodney Dangerfield) abuses his daughter.  The juxtaposition of the laughing is humorous, but the vile father isn't.  M & M get more notoriety as they advance their murder spree to the point of it becoming fodder for a national TV show headed by reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.).  Like terrorists, M & M want credit for their carnage and Gale is willing to give it to them.Once captured, M & M aren't finished as they create chaos in prison thanks to a clueless warden (Tommy Lee Jones) and Gales TV production.  ""NBK"" certainly satirizes television's fascination with violence (if it bleeds it leads) but truly piles on.  It also pokes fun at criminals and crime fighters alike, but I wonder how many bad guys watch this movie and ""get it.""  Stone throws every trick in the book in the production of this film.  Some of the movie is in color, some scenes are in black and white.  While most of the film is 35 mm, some is video tape and super 8.  He uses fantasy, newsreels and animation.  He even manages to toss in a few references to his JFK conspiracy theory.  So where do I stand?  Right down the middle.  If you can handle the violence and have an appreciation for dark comedy and satire, put this on your list.  If you're the least bit squeamish, skip it.The Blu ray transfer is excellent but does have variations due to the different formats Stone uses in the movie mix.  The Dolby TruHD is likewise excellent.  Near the film's conclusion a huge prison riot occurs and the chaos explodes from all the speakers which adds to the effect.  Great soundtrack by the way.",N/A

536214,"Upon initial viewing, I found this film equal parts entertaining and gratuitous (and quite over the top); despite the expert, near-camp direction of Ridley Scott and the honorable performance of Julianne Moore in a daring reimagining of Jodie Foster's triumphant role, its net effect was to somewhat sour my memory of Silence of the Lambs.  However, I was not particularly resentful of its existence until I bought the DVD.I'm a great fan of DVD documentaries and featurettes; I've always appreciated being given insights into the genesis and construction of films, even those detailing the production of movies I didn't particularly enjoy.  Unfortunately, after watching the ""Making of Hannibal"" piece on this DVD, I developed a true hatred of ""Hannibal"", and by association the entire Lecter franchise.The reason?  One Martha De Laurentiis (nee Schumacher), the widow of the late Dino De Laurentiis and producer of the Hannibal series from this film onward.  She is the salient narrator of this ghastly ""making of"" documentary, and watching her is like being powdered with fleas for 45 minutes.Mrs. De Laurentiis (and I use this salutation over Ms., as her marriage appears to be the most auspicious item on her CV), was previously a producer of relentless D-grade schlock films based on bargain-basement Stephen King adaptations (Maximum Overdrive, Cats Eye, Firestarter) before meeting and marrying Dino De Laurentiis, a Hollywood legend responsible for producing an even longer list of exploitation films and sequels.  The pasha's riches Mrs. De Laurentiis subsequently inherited from this unholy union (to a man nearly 40 years her senior) apparently included his vast fortune, a nepotistic position as president of his production company, and a very painful faux Italian accent.For the length of this documentary, this woman, who save her Donatella hairdo looks as if she plopped off the Mayflower, gushes one ""che bellisimo"" after another about how ""delicious"" it is to see Anthony Hopkins reprising his role as Hannibal the Cannibal, all  the while trilling her R's to the accompaniment of operatic choral music and spaghetti, linguini, blah blah blah.  As an Italian myself, after 10 minutes of cheesy That's Amore and inserts of sacred Florencian statues I had the urge to rush out for a nose-job and a new birth certificate.  The original film skittered enough on the precipice of artifice, but Mrs. De Laurentiis ladles so much garlicky pretentiousness and ostentation on the production that one is left more bloated and gassy than after a meal at Olive Garden.It is now impossible for me to watch this film (and its successors) without flashbacks to this looney hack's glee over the vast wealth she has amassed exploiting and embellishing the virtues of the original Silence of the Lambs.  I had to retrieve my jaw off the floor after listening to her glibly toss off Jodie Foster's sage decision to forgo reprising her role as Clarice Starling as ""disappointing, but totally solvable"", as if swapping actors known for beloved performances was as facile as choosing Buitoni over De Cecco.  She carries herself as if she had invented the primitive zoetrope, as opposed to have simply married someone old enough to have actually done it.This shameless PR piece is layered with a soaring, exultant score of endless arias and cellists reaching below their knees on their fretboards, apparently to imbue it with class (ala the tenors who serenade you at Macaroni Grill). And with the panoramic vistas of Florence, and handheld shots of the posh premiere (including a gorgeous spread of antipasti and Christopher Walken looking like a mafioso), one is led to believe that Hannibal is actually some De Sica masterpiece, rather than the gory, expensive splatter film it is.  How did I overlook the absurdity of Ray Liotta being fed his frontal lobes whilst Gourmet Valse Tartare was blasting on the soundtrack?Mangia, indeed.",N/A

I did enjoy the Walace and Gromit films and Chicken Run, but this film seemed to lack whatever they had in common with their computer animated cousins.

1391284,"The original Pirates of the Caribbean had the element of surprise on its side.  No one suspected that a film based on an antiquated attraction at Disney World would foster much entertainment value, and certainly no one thought it would become such a cultural juggernaut that it would spawn three sequels and catapult Johnny Depp to the top of the Hollywood A-list food chain, making him an international star.  I had been a Depp fan since childhood and had enjoyed his status as an idiosyncratic outsider, content to play dress up with his friends, and when I first saw a preview for Pirates of the Caribbean, I must admit that my eyes rolled and asked myself, what the hell is Depp thinking?  And then the movie came out.  Not only was the film filled with clever conceits, thanks in part to a screenplay that felt like the intricate work of an old fashioned clockmaker, but Depp turned in a surprisingly rousing performance as the effete, possibly insane pirate, Jack Sparrow.  Here was a multi-million dollar film and in the center stood a character fueled by pure id, stabbing other characters in the back in a moments notice while never letting the audience in on whether he does so out of a sense of self preservation or as part of a grander, more heroic scheme.  If there is a Falstaff for the 21st century, then his name is Jack Sparrow.And then the sequels happened.  Weighted down by their ever expanding mythology, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End limped through their expanding running time while dragging along enough subplots for at least five more films.  At the beginning of the first film we are concerned with Depp's attempts to reclaim his ship and the romance between Will and Elizabeth, but by the end of the third movie a major plot point pivoted around the unrequited love of Calypso, a tertiary character who would have been mostly forgettable if she weren't played by the immensely talented Naomie Harris.  Where The Curse of the Black Pearl's tight plotting and clearly established supernatural rules made it seem shorter than its two hours and fifteen minutes, the two sequels felt much, much longer than their already bloated running times.  I understand that the filmmakers were trying to give us a bang for our buck, but they also needed to learn how to leave the audience wanting more.It is with these widely held critiques in mind that the filmmakers went into the fourth Pirates movie, On Stranger Tides.  And there are several elements that tell us that the movie is attempting to swing all the way back around to the original film in hopes of bottling a little of the magic that made the first film a runaway success.  First, Will and Elizabeth have been jettisoned from the film.  This is good news because these two characters seemed unnecessary in the last two movies, and it increasingly felt as if the actors had merely wandered onto the set because they had nowhere else to go.  Second, the film is only tenuously connected to the byzantine mythology of the last few films.  Sure, characters like Captain Barbossa show up, but it is not necessary to be intimately familiar with the details of his curse, death and resurrection from the other three films.  Both of these choices allow the film to focus on what really matters: the character of Jack Sparrow.So, does the film actually accomplish what it set out to do?  Is On Stranger Tides a return to form?  In a word, no.  But that doesn't mean that it's not a good time, and the film bodes well for the inevitable sequels coming our way.  Plenty of film critics have taken On Stranger Tides to task for not living up to the promises of the first film, and while their complaints are not without merit, I strongly believe the movie largely delivers.On Stranger Tides follows multiple entities as they each lie, steal and cheat in order to make their way to the elusive Fountain of Youth, first discovered and then re-lost by Ponce De Leon nearly two centuries previous.  The entries into this mad, mad chase are the Spanish government, a coldly calculating participant, the British government, lead by former pirate Barbossa, the cutthroat Blackbeard, and of course Jack Sparrow himself.  After a rousing opening escape from the clutches of the British, Jack finds himself tracking down rumors of another Jack Sparrow who's gathering a crew in London.  The Jack Sparrow impersonator happens to be an old flame, Angelica, in costume, a play on Jack's effeminate mannerisms as well as the plethora of Jack Sparrow wannabes that walk the street on Halloween.  A nun who broke her vow of chastity to Jack, Angelica doesn't quite trust the pirate, but she needs the map to the Fountain of Youth, which happens to be in Jack Sparrow's possession.Of course, there are a plethora of double and triple crosses that occur throughout the film.  Like a good magician, the film does a lot with just a little slight of hand.  Angelica can not exactly be trusted (or can she?), and Jack winds up in the forced servitude of the pirate Blackbeard, played with suave menace by Ian McShane.  Concerned about a prophecy about his impending death, Blackbeard is also searching out the Fountain of Youth, but in order to actually use the fountain, he must procure a tear drop from a mermaid.  In the world of the Pirates movies, mermaids are vicious creatures who put on a doe eyed veneer in order to, like the sirens, lure men to their death.  The mermaid segment is particularly well executed.  The director, Rob Marshall, uses beautiful underwater shots of the small boats that have gone out to lure the mermaids, while ratcheting up the tension.  We know from the reactions of the sailors that the mermaids are dangerous and they could strike at any moment, creating an air pregnant with tension.With the inclusion of the mermaids, however, comes one of the film's failings, an unnecessary subplot that often tries the audience's patience.  A young missionary character who has been captured by Blackbeard is dropped like a cannonball into the middle of the film for no particular reason.  We are told who he is thanks to some leaden exposition by Angelica, and when they do finally capture a mermaid, her and the missionary start making googly eyes at one another.  The mermaid and the missionary seem like they're replacements for Will and Elizabeth, but unlike those two characters the audience has little investment in this couple.  The movie has a few other flaws as well.  The filmmakers regularly break the show not tell rule.  Captain Barbossa, for example, explains to Jack about how he lost the ship, The Black Pearl, to Blackbeard, telling him that Blackbeard's magic turned the ship against its own men, its ropes cutting down the Pearl's crew.  While he told this story, I couldn't help but think, that would have been cool to actually see, but thanks for sharing anyway Barbossa.But despite these flaws, On Stranger Tides is a film whose desire to please is evident.  All the main actors do a fantastic job, even if McShane is elbowed out of much of the film by some unnecessary subplots.  There are also some great twists throughout the movie.  I won't spoil them for you here, but let us just say that not everyone is searching for the Fountain of Youth for eternal life.  So even when the movie stumbles, it still entertains.  On Stranger Tides is not the return to form it so desperately wants to be, but it is a nice indicator that if we are going to get at least two more of these Pirates movies, then at the very least they will serve as good summer diversions.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

One of his first actions was to join the KKK in Missouri in order to become affiliated with the foremost political machine in the state. Once he made it to national office, he no longer considered himself a member as he did not need the KKK. What actually makes him the worst president is that he gave all of eastern Europe to the Soviet Union. The allies had just fought a war in order, partially, to keep Europe from being conquered by Nazi Germany. However, Truman just gave all of eastern Europe to the Soviet Union without a shot being fired. His best military leader, General Patton saw the threat from the Soviet quite clear. General Patton wanted to march straight through Germany to protect eastern Europe. Unfortunately, Truman, who knew absolutely about military tactics, disagreed to venomously with Patton that he relieved Patton of his command. A few years later, the same scenario was played out again in the Korean conflict.  General MacArthur, knowing that the war could not be won on the ground, wanted to bomb North Korea and China with 30 to 50 atom bombs. Again, Truman,  who still knew absolutely about military tactics, relieved General MacArthur of his command and the war was lost. Harry Truman was the reason the United States was involved in the cold war. If he had done what his military experts had wanted to do, there would have been no Soviet Union, Communist China, Communist North Korea or Communist Cuban.

1530826,"Pacashau Sacred Divinity Choir has lost their choir master, Bernard Sparrow, and they need someone to replace him. G.G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton) feels she's better qualified, but the church council gives the position to Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah). The church has entered The National Joyful Noise Competition four years in a row, always getting to the regional semi-finals but never making it to the finals. Because of the bad economy, people in the small town of Pacashau are really counting on the choir to win this time.I laughed quite a bit watching this movie. I don't think Vi Rose and G.G. got along even before the church council's decision. The bickering between the two of them was funny.  And the scene by the hotel elevator: I know Vi Rose was serious, and I was glad she got around to telling Olivia what she needed to hear, but some of the things she said to her daughter made me laugh. But the funniest part of the movie was the pep talk Vi Rose gave the choir after Our Lady of Perpetual Tears performed. Queen Latifah does very well in comedic roles.There were touching scenes: The talk Vi Rose had with her son, when G.G. sang `From Here to the Moon and Back' and when Vi Rose sang `Fix Me'.There were lots of good lines - or some I could probably call folk sayings or words of wisdom. My favorites: When folks get too wrapped up in themselves, they make very small packages/People who ain't around make very few mistakes/God gives you girls so your mama can say, ""I told you so.""I didn't expect Asperger's to be addressed. What a person with this syndrome goes through, what may be felt about the condition and the struggles - it was all very well done. Dexter Darden played Vi's son, Walter, and he gave a fine performance.I didn't really care for G.G.'s grandson, Randy (Jeremy Jordan), and that's mostly because of the way he disrespected Vi and he was not a good influence on Olivia (Keke Palmer). I did not like his `church girl' remark; it was not a good message to send to teenage girls who care about living for Jesus. I guess Randy had his good moments, but the boy was a rebel. So, the young love thing - Randy's relationship with Olivia - would have been sweet, but it wasn't.I liked the character Devonne (DeQuina Moore), because that habit she had was kinda cute and funny. It was nice to see Jesse L. Martin (Law & Order's Detective Ed Green) as Marcus Hill, Vi's husband. I liked the way his character was used to show the pressure a loving father and husband can feel during hard economic times. And I enjoyed seeing Kirk Franklin on stage.Jeremy Jordan, Keke Palmer, Queen Latifah, Dolly Parton - there are good singing voices in this movie. The music is what I loved most, especially Vi Rose (Queen Latifah) singing ""Fix Me' and Our Lady of Perpetual Tears singing `That's The Way God Planned It' - the soloist, Ivan Kelley, Jr. is awesome!!!!  I had purchased those two songs before watching the Amazon Instant Video. After the movie I immediately purchased the soundtrack.I didn't expect the profanity, but it didn't really bother me; however, the sex out of wedlock could have been handled differently. What I mean is, Pastor Dale (Courtney B. Vance) should have given Earla (Angela Grovey) a better, more godly response. And there were moments that reminded me of Sister Act 2, starring Whoopi Goldberg, and The Fighting Temptations, starring Cuba Gooding, Jr., but still, Joyful Noise is good, uplifting entertainment.*Do not copy/paste my review without permission.

There are only a couple of the films where the sound mix levels were a little uneven (dialogue volume versus background music) but these are just a few instances and therefore quite negligible. Particularly at this price, I highly recommend the purchase of this Blu-ray set. I have just one complaint which is why my rating is a ""4"" and not a ""5"". The book that the Blu-ray discs are housed in, does not have the conventional center clasp that securely holds the Blu-ray disc in place. Instead, the discs are housed in a slot that you have to slide them in and out of. This is quite poor because of the risk of damaging the discs.

1505966,"I'd agree with the other reviewers that said that Dolph really holds this film together. Probably more than anything else, Dolph Lundgren is the reason I bought this film before seeing it. Dolph's performance does not disappoint. He's always been a larger than life presence on screen, and this film is no exception. He's also smart enough to not take the material too seriously and, therefore, have a good time with it. His smart-aleck delivery of many of his lines is right on and often very funny, intentionally so.The second reason I was curious about this film is because of the director, Uwe Boll. Uwe's career is much maligned, that's no secret. But, Uwe's films have a lot more going for them than people give them credit for. First of all, is Boll's uncanny ability to assemble some of most interesting casts that I've ever seen put together. He hasn't just done this once; he does it consistently. Secondly, Boll's films are always well photographed. They always look great, and there are often some surprisingly beautiful shots of natural scenery. Thirdly, his films often have very good musical scores. In the Name of the King 1 and 2 are perfect examples of the quality of material that Boll's composers deliver. Lastly, no matter the budget, Boll always seems to set out to make big movies. This enthusiasm is evident in all of the films of his I've seen.That being said, In the Name of the King 2 is not a film that you can necessarily enjoy with a straight face. You have to be willing to understand that this is a film that is meant to be taken light-heartedly and simply enjoyed for laughs both intentional and unintentional.

It was so heavily censored that Spider-Man was not allowed to throw punches. They also made Spidey a weakling. In one episode, Kingpin nearly crushed him to death (he only escaped after Green Goblin inadvertently saved him). In another episode, the Lizard attacked Spidey and he had to be rescued by Storm and Iron Man. The heroes who guest starred in that series regularly outshone Spidey.This series was so much better. Spidey had his trademark sense of humor. Like many people said, it had a lot of sexual innuendo (I have a huge crush on Indy). There were also some adult themes (Spidey even had to deal with a stalker). No one under 14 should watch it. However, if you're a true Spider-Man fan you'll appreciate it. Many people have complained that Spider-Man does not fight his iconic villains like Venom and Doc Ock and while that is a legitimate complaint, I was happy to see new villains.

23561,"April 14, 2012 will mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic.  ""A Night to Remember,"" based on the 1955 bestseller by Walter Lord, is likely the most accurate film about the great ship and its disastrous maiden voyage.  A 1953 film about the Titanic and James Cameron's 1997 megahit both emphasize the human drama of passengers aboard the ship.  ""A Night to Remember"" (1958) concentrates more on the design flaws that ultimately led to the ship's demise, and the hourly countdown as the ship foundered.Director Roy Ward Baker doesn't have Cameron's flair, but he holds our attention with solid performances by Kenneth More, Ronald Allen, Robert Ayres, and a pre-James Bond Honor Blackman.  The sinking is shown from the point of view of Second Officer Charles Lightoller (More) and uses convincing models in an era before CGI, though we do not see the ship break in two, a scene spectacularly rendered in Cameron's movie.  The film has a documentary feel, avoids melodrama, and remains the definitive cinematic version of the last hours of the White Star liner.The new Blu-ray digital restoration contains audio commentary by the authors of ""Titanic: An Illustrated History,"" a 60-minute making-of documentary, archival interview with Titanic survivor Eva Hart; a 1962 Swedish documentary featuring interviews with Titanic survivors; and a 2006 BBC documentary.",N/A

I would have liked to see some evidence,beyond an apple orchard, of anything to maintain/  build a new civilization ( wasn't it the bar keeper who had the only tech to repair/ replace damaged microchips?), that was about the least plausible part of the storyline.Many of the stories were standard Cop/family plots, a lot of that already on TV so that didn't help Terra Nova. The Dinosaurs mostly looked pretty good, much better than SyFy does- the worst bit of that when the little girl gives the "" baby"" back to it's mother. The casting wasn't too bad, Stephen Lang and Shelly Conn were best, ( the two girls were at least vaguely similar to her in coloring, the son didn't look like anybody).The expense of producing a series like this may have had as much as anything to do with its cancellation. The end of season cliff hanger indicated a storyline that could only get more expensive. With presumably weak ratings Terra Nova had no chance.Like others I would like to see some sort of conclusion but don't see a movie or miniseries in the future due to those expenses. Fan fiction to the rescue?At least one review complained about picture quality, I certainly hope that was their player and not the DVD, as the only way to get the show in HD (I've been told it looked great) is by download from Amazon or Apple, my data plan won't allow for that much online time. At least we appear to get a few extras, A&A; don't offer that.9/23/12 additionI've tried a few episodes out, really clear image, and I've found, for me at least, a bug in the extended version of the season finale. Pausing and/ or using &lt; or > and then play at the point where the suicide bomber blows up at the portal and then again when Taylor tells Maddy Shannon's soldier boyfriend to find that cargo container will cause my 2005 Sony DVD player to lock up. No other episode does that (and that episode is fine if I  don't touch the remote), no other DVD I've ever had does it either. My 2007 Philips has no problems, my brothers XBox is fine too. The only way I've found out of the freeze is just to hit stop and start over, I don't have nerve enough to see just how many spots I have this bug, most of the episode is bug free, I think.",Terra Nova

From what i've ""researched"" there are 5 episodes on this dvd, here they are:Episode 8- My Fair ReboundEpisode 9- QuintupletsEpisode 11- Homeward PoundEpisode 15- ZoltronEpisode 19- The K-9 Kidthese are very good episodes and i'm going to order this as soon as i get money!! GO POUND PUPPIES!! if ur as much of a fan as i am (and i'm a HUGE fan!!) then preorder this dvd NOW!!!UPDATE:Ok, i recieved my copy of the Pound Puppies Homeward Pound DVD April 21, 2012 and it's AWESOME!! The back contains 1 pic of episode 2 which is NOT included in this DVD set. This dvd contains Homeward Pound (ep 11), My Fair Rebound (ep 8), Quintuplets (ep 9), The K-9 Kid (ep 19), and Zoltron (ep 15) (in that order). It comes with a bonus feature which is a character artist showing you how to draw Lucky DIRECTLY IN THE STUDIO!! Also on the back, the show is rated TV-Y7 (it's original rating) and the characters on the back are a little paler than usual. Plus they add Mr. NutNut as part of the team (when, technically, he's NOT!!). But, on the plus side, it comes with the FULL version of the very 1st Pound Puppies ad on the hub and its AMAZING!! it also comes with the very 1st ad for My Little Pony as well. The menu, when it starts opens with the Pound Puppies theme song beginning, but with end credit audio. The menu itself is animated using 9 Story Entertainment (even the select episodes part!!). The only thing in the menu that Studio B animated was just a picture for the How to Draw Lucky part of the DVD (even though the eps are from Studio B). Well, that's my review and this DVD deserves 5-stars!!",Pound Puppies: Homeward Pound

1525406,"""The Darkest Hour"" has potential. The premise is pretty darn interesting (although it's borrowed from other science fiction novels that have been around for at least twenty plus years)--what if an alien invasion occurs by creatures that we just can't see and appear to be electrical in nature? How do we fight something like that much less survive?When a website designer Ben(Anthony Mingella) and his best friend Sean(Emile Hirsch)travel to Moscow to pitch their new design to a company they are greeted with disappointed--the head of the company Skyler (Joel Kinnaman)has ripped off the design and has no plans on paying them (his advice--""next time include a PDA""). The angry and disappointed duo end up clubbing where they meet Natalie (Olivia Tirlby)and Anne (Rachal Taylor). The attack occurs while the four and Skyler are at the club. Everyone who comes into contact with the aliens are vaporized and the quintet are on the run for their survival.There's all the best elements for a thriller here but the writers (including Jon Spaihts who worked on an early version of ""Prometheus"")and director Chris Gorak (who directed a fascinating Indie thrillerRight at Your Doorwhere he does everything right that he gets wrong in this movie)do very little to develop the characters or the premise beyond your standard invasion movie. In fact ""The Darkest Hour"" borrows liberally from other recent invasion flicks (including Spielberg's version of War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)).The Blu-ray release of this looks extremely good. Shot on digital video it almost looks as good as film in terms of its presentation here.The 5.2 lossless soundtrack sounds terrific with strong presence but still maintaining clear dialogue.The special features are actually in some ways better than the feature film itself. ""Survivors"" a short film based in the same ""world"" manages to be a stronger examination of the same themes.""Visualizing the Invasion"" gives us the behind-the-scenes nuts and bolts of creating the interesting visual effects used throughout the film.We also get deleted and extended scenes with commentary that gives us a bit of context as to why they were not used.Finally we get a feature length commentary track by the director focusing on everything the challenges of shooting for a 3D exhibition (knowing eventually it will be shown without the 3D effects as well), shooting on location in Moscow and the various changes that were made to the script prior to shooting.It's a pity that the director and writers didn't take a more unusual approach to the material as the premise itself it fascinating but it is developed into a VERY conventional invasion thriller with few surprises in the film.""The Darkest Hour"" might be worth a rental (which is what I did)but I really couldn't recommend purchasing it unless you temper your expectations and get it for a decent price.",N/A

390141,"This is a beautifully directed movie with some of the Hollywood's best players. Leslie Howard and Bette Davis offer memorable performances in this drama where a medical student is attracted to a promiscuous waitress with tragic consequences. This is based on the novel of Somerset Maugham who lived in Paris until he was ten, then educated at King's School, Canterbury, and at Heidelberg University He goes to study medicine in London and then start writing novels. The lead character Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) tries to become an artist in Paris and after being turned down, he goes to London and enrolls in a medical college. Philip Carey is born with a clubfoot, and as he grows up, orphaned, he struggles with his own deformity. While at Medical school he meets a sultry waitress named, Mildred Rogers; his passion and love for her carries him to the edge of self-destruction.  He becomes an instrument in the hands of a cold-hearted woman, and finds himself snubbed, and ridiculed. Her promiscuous nature does not teach Philip anything but leads him to a path of defeat and destruction.Somerset Maugham's novel is lot more than just story of Philip and Mildred, and there are other unforgettable characters. Each person Philip encounters leaves lasting impression on him. The most notable are Norah (Kay Johnson) who offers him unquestionable love and care, and the Athlneys, Sally Athlney (Frances Dee) and Thorpe Athlney (Reginald Owen) has strong positive influence on him through their goodness and simplicity of life.At the end of the movie, penniless and stricken with tuberculosis, Mildred passes away and then Philip realizes what he is missing all along his life; the sweetness of a woman like Sally. This movie gave the opportunity for Bette Davis to be a star and influential people of Movie industry ran a campaign to have her name included for Academy award in 1934. She was only 26 when the film was completed and many moviegoers began to notice Bette Davis as a leading lady of Hollywood movies. During an interview Davis recalled that she didn't like Leslie Howard's treatment on the sets.  Director John Cromwell brings a certain amount charisma in handling the lack of chemistry between the two characters into a reality.1.TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - Bette Davis (Now, Voyager / Dark Victory / Old Acquaintance / Jezebel)2.The Bette Davis Collection, Vol. 3 (The Old Maid / All This, And Heaven Too / The Great Lie / In This Our Life / Watch on the Rhine / Deception)",Of Human Bondage VHS

This had to be the worst science-fiction series I have ever seen. The writing was sloppy, story lines confusing and special effects and props/ models very amateurish. The first few episodes were very difficult to get through. They made almost no sense at all. Subsequent episodes smoothed out and started to show some improvement as the characters developed a little, but overall I found it to be a complete waste of time and money. Sad too, as I have seen the actors in other roles and they were all quite talented and convincing, but in this series not so. As a result I'd have to conclude the problem had to be the script.

In an attempt to clear the priest that helped Emily, a woman researches the subject and is awakened to the terrifying truth that demons exist and are not a good thing.This movie has a pretty good cast with some familiar faces. The movie itself is about the court case surrounding the circumstances of Emily's exorcism. The priest is being sued for negligence, and he is clearly innocent. We all know that the justice system functions poorly, and sometimes injustice is rendered. This is one such example. The film is very powerful. It has some graphic and frightening situations. The box says that is as scary as The Exorcist. That isn't true....it's not even close. But don't let that turn you off of it. This movie stands by itself and is a very good watch.

After all the great action and suspense in the last MI movie and the great reviews I heard and the money it made I just knew this was a sure hit. Even the title is very cool. But what I watched lacked a reasonable plot had zero suspense. The action was not even that great and the bad guy came off as some crazy fool who's ideas made little sense and was not explained at all.The actors were just as poor the girl on the team should have kept her part on Law and Order SVU.

93887,"In 2004, the movie ""Saw"" vaulted to the top of many ""psychological thriller"" lists via its gritty depiction of violence and insights into the criminal mind.  Nearly ten years earlier, ""Se7en"" covered similar material and, barring one slip-up, could have stolen Saw's thunder.For a basic plot summary, ""Se7en"" focuses on a series of brutal crimes revolving around the seven deadly sins of religious lore.  Investigators Mills (Brad Pitt) & Somerset (Morgan Freeman) are assigned to the case, each bringing a unique perspective (in keeping with their general film personas) to the strange murders.  As they near the end of the case, the detectives discover that the man they are pursuing has ideas about human nature that, while sadistic, might just cut to the core of what makes us all fallible.There are two reasons why this movie works as well as it does...First, the overall storyline is just very well-crafted.  Director David Fincher has proven time and time again that he knows how to construct a solid motion picture, and this one is no different.  By the end of the movie, you'll be questioning your very beliefs on what you just saw, making this a very cerebral experience.Also, Fincher does not shy away from portraying the re-enactments of the seven deadly sins in their graphic detail.  Some people would probably view this as overkill or gross-out film-making, but Fincher realized that it HAD to be this way for such a dark, gritty film to work.In terms of acting, Pitt & Freeman turn in their usual solid performances.  The character arcs seemed a bit forced (Pitt as the ""eager rookie"", Freeman as the ""grizzled vet""), but the physical acting itself (as well as the way it all comes together in the end) more than makes up for that.The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars (and also the same reason why I can't say it is as good as Saw)?  To me, the real ""meat"" of the story is when the two detectives finally confront the villain (played to perfection by Kevin Spacey).  Whereas in Saw, the ""Jigsaw"" killer is given as much backstory & screen time as the protagonists, ""Se7en"" only focuses on Spacey's character for the last portion of the film.  Everything leading up the that is a procedural cop story (albeit a graphic & disturbing one).Thus, I consider ""Se7en"" to be a groundbreaking effort in the psychological thriller department, paving the way for later efforts like ""Saw"".  It isn't perfect, but it did (at least at the time) tread new ground.  Unless you are overly squeamish, this movie will keep you engaged from its shocking beginning to its even more shocking finale!",Seven
1320933,"Having worked on productions by another indie filmmaker, Youtube director Frank Stamm, I've been interested in Jared Hess' career. He scored big time with ""Napoleon Dynamite"" but then promptly went off the rails (in my opinion) with ""Nacho Libre"", one of many Jack Black disasters, as just about every other film he stars in is. With ""Gentlemen Broncos"", Hess seems to get why ""Napoleon"" worked and ""Nacho Libre"" didn't. He dials in the cartoonish-ness and brings us back to a sort-of recognizable suburbia. The film feels a little like Jared Hess retrenching, but I'm not complaining. I liked ""Napoleon"" and it's good to see another film in that vein, even if it doesn't reach the same heights.",N/A

1574249,"Macabre aka Rumah Dara really took me by surprise in that it not only lived up to but far exceeded all the hype. I'd heard a lot about the Indonesian gorefest the last couple of years (the movie was made in 2009) and got excited when Bloody Disgusting Selects announced they had picked it up for US distribution. However, unless anything has changed between me writing this review and now, inexplicably BD have still yet to release Macabre stateside. What's being sold here is the region one Canadian dvd release, and if it's still going at under ten dollars it really is a steal and I'd recommend you pick it up without any further hesitation. Even at twice the price, you'll still be getting your money's worth. Macabre/Darah is the sort of movie you'll want to tell people about, a great movie to watch with a crowd or alone, and one that warrants multiple viewings. It's not that it breaks the mold particularly - really how many horror movies these day really do? - but that it succeeds with what it sets out to deliver. If you liked Inside, Frontiers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn and others of their ilk you won't be disappointed. Once the movie gets going, its pretty much a non-stop rollercoaster right to the end. Chief amongst its many strengths is the movie's iconic central villain, a genuinely creepy turn by Shareefa Daanish as Darah (see cover). And while everything about the production is strong, special mention should also go to the movie's other star, the visual effects (or maybe that should be visceral effects) of make-up artist Alexey Petryaev.

The movie had so much potential and had such a big following from just the trailer and of course when a trailer is that good there is always a little let down, but i don't think anyone expected for a let down like this. The movie is seriously set up like a show on national geographic exploring the art of exorcism and getting your first period, it captures that part perfectly, and it is just so boring. Yes exorcism movies typically have a lot of talking and stuff like that but this was unbearable, all it was, was talking and trying to be scary, which at some points was actually pretty funny. There was like 5 times during the whole movie that i jumped, the rest i sat there in my seat struggling to stay awake and to not yawn so loud. The camera was very shaky and i had a hard time seeing certain things or concentrating on certain things during the movie cause it was shaky or moving too much. And the ending, made the whole movie a horrible waste of time. the worst ending i have ever seen next to the ending of The Mist.

Yet Ree struggles to keep her family fed, her siblings in school and proudly refuses to ask for help.""You don't ask for what should be offered,"" she admonished her six year old sister.""Do we eat them?"" her twelve year old brother asks her, meaning the guts from the squirrels they have just hunted.""Not yet,"" she says.But they could have to eat them soon because her father has put their house as his bail bond, then disappeared. If he doesn't show up for his trial, they will be homeless within the week.""I'll find him,"" Ree tells the policeman who has given her the news.Determined, she starts her quest, and even though nobody, not even her only uncle, wants to help her, she perseveres.""He is dead,"" her father's sometimes buddies tell her and take her to a house, once a meth lab, destroyed in an explosion.""Father was not careless,"" she spits at them.

885920,"""Vera Drake,"" which lends subtle insight into the plight of women who needed to terminate a pregnancy during the austerity years of 1950's London, is very difficult to rate. On the one hand, the understated performances of Imelda Staunton and, indeed, the entire cast, are superb. The actor playing the husband is especially convincing, as are the sympathetically portrayed detectives and the woman police constable, who treat Vera with kindness. On the other hand, the film is so understated, with very little dramatic tension, that it moves towards an inevitable conclusion, which, in contrast with the slow pace of the film, seems abrupt. It left me with unresolved questions concerning Vera's past as well as her future.Its message is implied rather than stated in the difference of class: the girl from a wealthy family is able to get around the strict letter of the law with connections, money, and a comfortable nursing home, while girls from the working class had to rely on dubious go-betweens, and they were lucky if they got a woman as scrupulous and good-hearted as Vera (It would have been interesting to discover what sentence the go-between--who, unbeknownst to Vera, has taken money for her services--received.).Unlike another reviewer, I found Vera's tears to be convincing. They are the tears of a hard-working woman, who has always acted from the best motives, to aid girls who had no other options, but whose actions, when brought to light, have brought disgrace on her utterly respectable family.The theme of ""Vera Drake"" is as serious as it is sad, but the film is by no means a downer, since its characters are portrayed with both sensitivity and grace.",N/A

She is often unlikable yet she is also a victim of primogeniture.  although it is her sister who is the suffragette, she should be the one into women's rights as the biggest victim of sexism.Dan Stevens, as the new heir apparent Matthew, is actually quite appealing by our standards.  This noble family is shocked by his work ethic.  He is the son of a doctor and nurse and is a commercial lawyer who works a very full week and then some. He has a hard time understanding the purpose of many of the servants in this privileged world.  for one, he has always dressed himself and thinks having a servant to dress you, a valet, is silly.  he is much easier to like than Lady Mary.  His mother is even better.the mother becomes the chief thorn in the side of the lord of the manor's mother, played by Maggie Smith.  the two older women are at constant odds.  the battle of wits between these two is a comedic delight involving everything from chairing the hospital to judging the flower show,having just finished season one, the ultimate test of how much one likes somethingisthat i plan on watching season two this weekend.  that review will follow shortly.",N/A
1513722,"Leaving most of the many questions unanswered is not that big of a deal as it becomes clear the real purpose of this series is the interpersonal relationships between/among the various players. Why there is a barren landscape and large bugs isn't really important as much too much of anime has mass destruction of civilization/the environment for any number of reasons and it would be a waste of time to come up with still another reason why it happened this time. It was rather interesting watching the sub-titled version and I should have left it alone and not gotten this the dubbed version as I spent so much time reading the subtitles I did not notice just how damn UGLY the characters are,with a possible exception of Felli and only because a portion of her bangs fell across her face.Anime has always had spotty success with noses but this time they look like diseased growths on their faces and,matched with unattractive eyes,it became unbearable to finish rewatching this series. Monica Rial dubbed Felli and did her normal excellent job and,while Collen Clinkenbeard was heavily involved with production,character design was so bad their efforts were wasted.

1546083,"My only question is, why would they take so long to release some so brilliant? Growing up listening to MJ, the Bad era was and still by far my favorite and ever since I watched his Bucharest concert when it first aired I always wondered if we would see any older concerts at all. All I can say that it's a shame they kept this locked up for so long, but now that we have it all I can say now is FINALLY!I am very happy with this release. I feel this performance exceeded that of the Dangerous concert. The entire focus was MJ and the band and if there was anything that defined the art of music and performance this is it. MJ performed songs in this concert that he has not performed since like ""This Place Hotel"", ""Dirty Diana"", ""Rock With You"". Plus, we still get the good stuff like, ""Beat It"", ""Billie jean"", etc. You see MJ was having fun in this concertas he smiled a lot more and was very energetic. Every performance was high energy. MJ is a prime example of being one with music. Also the band gets some time to shine as they have a little jam session in mid-show which I think was pretty cool.I see many people complained about the video qulaity. Well we get what we can get. Besides, this was ripped from the original VHS recordings so the footage can only be restored so much. Considering what we have in this release it's really not bad. I just think many of us have been spoiled with HD we expect everything in HD. This is a good release so don't let that get you down.

The cast and director were really on their game, and I found myself engrossed in this film even when I knew what was going to happen and why.

365417,"Some reviewers seem to believe that people would only give this film low ratings if they are uncomfortable with the sexual issue. Well, that's preposterous. I had my first crush in kindergarten.  Although it was on another kid, I later had crushes on adults - like most kids. The film actually does a good job portraying kids as sexual beings (which they are). Jan - Jerron's young friend -  loved looking at porn magazines and talking about sex. There was one moment where he tried to stimulate himself while wrestling with Jerron. Kids do these things.The issue of the soldiers and sex is also portrayed. At one point, they bring in women to ""service"" the troops. One girl gets a ""farewell"" gift from a soldier - and I believe she supposedly had a crush on him too. Another young girl appeared in a scene topless and crying; I am assuming she had been assaulted by one of the soldiers. It was war. These things happen. I am not excusing it; I am just saying that anyone with knowledge of human behavior shouldn't be offended by the film.There are some downsides to the film. WE don't get enough info about the soldier. Depending upon his age, this might not have been extremely taboo. Many kids ran off to the war. And without computers, it was not always easy to verify ages. There were a lot of 16 and 17 year olds in WWII. So, it is unclear what the age gap really is. I also wanted to know a little about the soldier's mental state. We know that the young boy is truly in full crush mode. But what does this mean to the soldier? His character is very one dimensional. I blame this on the writing - because the actor was good.I loved how the filmed married past with present (you'll have to watch to know what this means). These were probably the two most creative moments in the movie. Some of that creativity was lost during the middle of the film. I was also bothered that there wasn't enough info at the beginning about the relocation of the children. I figured it out. But I imagine some viewers were lost.Also, the movie spent a lot of time at the beginning building the characters of Jerron and his friend Jan. Suddenly, however, Jan is tossed aside for the soldier. I think they should have spent less time on Jan and more on the soldier. This would have given us more about his background. Instead, he is just a flat fantasy figure. In fact, had the romance been between Jerron and Jan, the movie would have been far more interesting - simply because we know more about Jan.Overall, this is a good film. A lot of kids long for relationships like this with adults. MOST adults stay clear of them. The kids' desire doesn't neutralize the exploitative nature of these relationships. It makes the analysis somewhat more complicated, but it is still exploitative. I would give it a 3.5 - but since I can't - I have rounded up to a four.Finally, I have read so many reviews that argue that this film wouldn't be made by Americans or is supposedly too horrific for American audiences. Please -- give me a break. You must distinguish very expensive Hollywood productions that are designed for general audiences and that are indeed SUCCESSFULLY MARKETED AROUND THE WORLD with smaller independent films -- like this one -- that are viewed by more select audiences. I have seen many independent US films that deal with issues of sexuality. So, let's retire the stereotype.",N/A

1404635,"First off, I wont ramble on about the synopsis of this movie as you are here by one of three sources, Amazon recommended it, you saw a trailer for it on YouTube, or you heard about it by word of mouth. I have been following this movie since IMDB said that Cassandra Peterson (Elvria) was going to be in it and have been dying to see it since. If you want a synopsis just scroll up on this screen, the info that Amazon provided is right on the nail.While watching this modern cult masterpiece I felt completely astonished and ecstatic to know that someone still understood what it took to make a great camp black comedy.  To this I have to say the writer/director, Joshua Grannell AKA Peaches Christ is an amazing talent that proves his/her brilliance by not only screenwriting and acting but directing.From start to finish I loved this movie, it had the right amount of camp, comedy and horror to fill the complete feature.  My only complaint was I hated for the movie to end! In all of my years of being a movie buff, age 5 to current age 27, this has got to be the best contemporary horror comedy in ages.  The last time I remember being so blown away by a movie was when I saw Pink Flamingos for the first time, which was 10 years back.  While I am praising Peaches Christ I have to note that his/her style, is a nice mixture of classic John Waters, Herschell Gordon, Lewis, William Castle, etc.Peaches, the horror gay community needs you.  There are tons of gay/lesbian/bi/transgendered people out there who love horror and camp.  Until you graced us with your full length feature masterpiece we only had John Waters and few other names to cling to.  I honestly believe you can do for my generation and the upcoming generation what the ""Dreamlanders"" did for so many cult followers in the 70's.Finally, I would like to note that for some reason, Amazon doesn't have a stock of this movie. I'm not sure why but the individual seller that provides the movie through Amazon is actually the real Peaches Christ.  I am noting this because I know some people are hesitant in purchasing from an individual seller, however, I purchased my copy through Peaches via Amazon and was happy to note that the seller acted with speedy and prompt service.  When I received the DVD, it was factory sealed and in perfect condition, so don't be afraid to order from the seller on this page.Keep up the good battle Peaches!

1438319,"Before watching The Grace Card, I heard several very good reviews about it. Everyone who watched it seemed to think it was a very profound and well done movie of faith. Needless to say, I was excited to watch the movie and had high(er) expectations.The Pros:-The cinematography as a whole is not bad. For the most part, the shots were good.-The actor who played Mac (the white male cop, main protagonist) was the best actor in the movie. However, even he had some moments that were ""cringe worthy"".-The anger and frustration over finances in the home were spot on.The Cons:-The acting. ...Enough said.-The dialogue was clunky in several places.-Sometimes, the choices of scenes were more of a distraction than helping the story. In several cases the choice to put in a scene jolted you out of the flow of the story.-Overall, there was a feeling to the film that didn't sit right with me and those watching it with me. It's hard to describe. It's like you wished you had never watched the movie and never, ever want to watch it again. But it's more than that. It leaves a bad feeling with you for awhile. Thankfully, God isn't a God who wants you to be in that state and lifts you out of it!-There were faulty theories and strange comments that were rather disturbing. One scene/line in particular was at the end of the movie when a member of Sam's (the black male cop, main protagonist, pastor) church said to the rest of the congregation -about Sam-, ""Welcome him back, he's our healer, Pastor Sam!"" Whether you are Christian or not, that statement is very creepy. If you are Christian you'll know that the phrase contradicts everything in the Bible.-The movie, which is supposed to be a movie of God's grace and faith in Jesus, fell short in that area. Although it had a moment of repentance and two or three characters were ""Christians"", it really lacked God and having a relationship with Him. It was disappointing to see that the pastor/cop, Sam, became a pastor of a church because he thought it was the thing he was supposed to do and thought it was success to make ""his"" church bigger. He suffers from dissatisfaction in that he can't make things happen in the church. First of all, Sam shouldn't have become a pastor unless God specifically told him to- not because it seemed like the best thing for a good Christian guy, or the right thing to do. Second, he- as many real life pastors today- missed the fact that it's not about a bigger church attendance and it's not a pastor's job to make a mega-church. The job of the pastor is to shepard the people and to show God's heart. You do what God tells you to do and He'll bring the increase.Lastly, Sam never recognized the fact that the source of his dissatisfaction was that he needed a RELATIONSHIP with God and not a distant mutual acquaintance. He never realized that maybe he WASN'T supposed to be a pastor. Sam should have taken a hiatus from ministry until he knew that God wanted him to go back or to quit being a minister.Perhaps the real reason why this movie didn't make the cut is a combination of the bad feeling of the film, the lack of Jesus' saving grace, the odd comments and central theme of human grace and human healing.",N/A
686110,"I have seen several of Mamoru Oshii's films and noticed interesting patterns.  With his ""Patlabor"" TV series, he has a strong emphasis on entertainment with shades of mature themes.  In his ""Patlabor"" movies, he switches to a much more intellectually mature film with shades of ""pure entertainment"".  In his live action, ""Avalon"" he goes into a more ""art film"" focused mode with a disregard of entertainment.  So what did he do with ""Jin Roh""?  With ""Jin Roh"", he covers many profound intellectual themes while retaining a strong narrative that is both entertaining and engaging.  This is not a kid's show...I can't stress that enough.FOR THOSE CONCERNED...There isn't much issue with the language.  Also, fanservice is non-existent.  The director is taking a much more realistic approach to his animation.  That said, the violence can be quite vicious...nothing over the top...but still very vicious and bloody at times.MOVING ALONG...Plot (absolutely no plot spoilers):What makes this particular film brilliant is that it is a dark and masterful re-adaptation of our familiar fairy tale, ""Little Red Riding Hood"" (the Perrault version if I remember correctly).  From start to finish it uses this tale to expound on many serious and mature themes about reality, right/wrong, etc.  One of it's interesting questions about the ""Wolf"" inside.  It's very amazing how he both embellishes while stays true to the tale.Graphics:They are definitely marked by the era it was produced (the '90s I believe), but still beautiful and detailed.  The animators approached this project with a sense of realism that is rarely seen in most of todays commercial/popular anime.  No exaggerations, no embellishments...just normal life.  Strict realism.  In fact, there are a lot of messages that even the visual gives to add more depth to the story.  Very good stuff...and totally fits the mood.Extras:Doesn't exist hahaSUB vs DUBS:Rarely do i dislike dubs.  But this is one of the few instances I have to say that the Subtitles are a little stronger.ALL IN ALL...This was a good purchase.  It's not one that I would pull out often, but the retelling of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and how Oshii uses it to raise questions and issues is astounding.  It can be quite an emotional trip as well.  It is very dark, and very sad at points.  The film raises  some good (though not new) questions for one to ponder.  However, this is not a passive, popcorn/friday-night movie.

859812,"Do you all know M. Night Shyamalan? He writes and directs the most incredible movies. I've only seen one before, ""The Woman in the Water,"" and I loved it. As you can see by the stars, I loved this one, too.The Village is in a valley surrounded by woods, and there are monsters in those woods: those of whom we do not speak. There is a sort of contract with the monsters: the people in the Village do not go into the woods, and the monsters do not come into the Village. But the agreement has been violated, and terrible things begin to happen.A few of the citizens of the Village are especially important to the story, but I must not tell you much about the ways in which they are important. Edward Walker is one of the elders, and seems to be rather the leader of the elders, at least as ""first among equals."" The thing is, although they dress very simply, rather like Mennonites, there does not seem to be any special religious aspect to the Village. They came there to get away from the wickedness of the towns, but none of it is very specific.Ivy Walker, Edward's beautiful daughter, is blind. Perhaps that is the reason she has more courage than the rest of the Village; she's had to take risks just to get around.Lucius Hunt is just about the only other person who does not seem afraid, so of course he and Ivy fall in love. Naturally.But there's one more person who matters to the story: Noah Percy, who is some kind of crazy. He's not simply retarded, although perhaps autistic would be accurate. In any case, he's the one who laughs and invites the monsters in rather than being afraid. Or maybe he's afraid, too, but he laughs and invites them in.Gradually we learn that almost everyone among the elders lost a loved one to violence in the towns, and that's the main reason they came to the Village.From here, anything I say might give away the artfully crafted plot, and I do not want to do that.

1237749,I usually like Elmore Leonard's books and most of the movies made from them. Unfortunately this movie fell a bit short. It was too skewed to the brutality and less on the imaginative twists.

1591502,"Ask just about anyone about ""The Paperboy"" and they'll reply with something along the lines of, ""Isn't that that movie where Nicole Kidman pees on Zac Efron?"" It's funny because that seemed to be the only thing anyone knew about the film going into it. What's peculiar about ""The Paperboy"" is that it's difficult to pinpoint just what type of genre it is. There are comedic elements in there, it's very dramatic at times and really thrilling at others, and the ending is incredibly dark and unexpected. Unfortunately the film doesn't always hit its mark. In fact, it doesn't even hit the target at all at times.Just about every character introduced in the film is sex hungry. Add that to the white trash atmosphere and humor and it's a little overwhelming. Some will find it hysterical, but it's incredibly cheesy more often than not. Whether it's Jack complaining that his dad's maid Anita (Macy Gray) didn't knock before entering his room because he may have been jerking off, Jack and Yardley's obsession with having sex with Charlotte, or Anita's trashy voiceover that guides you through the events of the film that comes off more obnoxious than amusing, the film is constantly jumping all over the place except when it comes to its humor or sexual devotion.Things begin to get really ludicrous once everyone starts visiting the prison to see Hillary. Charlotte claims to get horny in Jack's car because of ""good vibrations"" while their first meeting with Hillary is just absolutely preposterous; Charlotte and Hillary basically orgasm without ever touching each other. It seems like the film wastes so much time with kinky scenes and silly dialogue.Some of the performances are really impressive though. Matthew McConaughey continues the dark streak he started with ""Killer Joe"" here as Ward has this demented side to him that's pretty shocking. He has this scene in his apartment where he's too drunk to function properly and is yelling memories of their mother to Zac Efron from the shower that's both haunting and kind of depressing. David Oyelowo also puts in a strong performance. Yardley's true motives make him an absolutely despicable character and Oyelowo does an impeccable job bringing those characteristics to life. Many of the characters seem to have this different side to them that they hide from the rest of the world; everyone except Hillary Van Wetter. He's not only as messed up as everyone thinks, but even more deranged than anyone can imagine. It's one of the most unusual roles John Cusack has ever portrayed.The way the film is edited is incredibly distracting. Shots are constantly bleeding into others while many scenes begin out of focus and jump around the room before finally settling on the scene at hand. The first few times this is done, it seems like an artistic endeavor. But once you realize that's the way the entire film is edited, it feels amateurish at best and its execution absolutely takes away from whatever the film did have to offer.The screenplay comes off like it's purposely trying to be awful and the film's inability to pick a genre and stick with it seems to hurt it more often than not. At the same time though, the majority of the performances are very strong and everything is certainly unpredictable. The humor is where the film may lose you though. Whether you're a fan of white trash humor that you'd probably find on any episode of ""Jerry Springer"" is what will swerve your opinion one way or the other. ""The Paperboy"" is constantly playing chicken with the line that divides a good movie from a bad one. Just when you've written it off, it reels you back in. Ridiculous through and through and absolutely jaw dropping at times, if ""The Paperboy"" is one thing it's a compelling piece of cinema.",The Paperboy

1047588,"This was one of the most consistently satisfying and engrossing miniseries I'd seen in a long time, whether sci-fi or otherwise. It has been mentioned otherwise about how entertaining motel/hotel stories are, whether ""Identity"" or ""1408"" or even ""Vacancy,"" but ""The Lost Room"" really seems to be unique -- I certainly don't recall seeing anything else quite like it. The story is very intriguing and very well written, the dialogue is believable and doesn't come across as stilted or unreal (in spite of the very surreal quality surrounding the events and the ""objects"" of the tale). Admittedly, there aren't a lot of unexpected twists or turns or similar ""gotcha""-style plot devices, but it's because there don't need to be. The action consistently stands on its own and moves along at excellent pacing; the theme of the story is bizarre enough in its own right without resorting to gimmicks to keep the viewer's attention.I thought the casting was well-done, too -- although the acting is mostly very good, no character stands out in such a way as to overshadow the rest, except perhaps the Joe Miller character (very ably and likably played by Peter Krause), but in a way this all makes sense. This is a tale of ordinary men and women caught up in the midst of an extraordinary state of existence that has somehow overlapped into reality as we know it, and the players all carry it off convincingly. I especially liked the supporting performances by Kevin Pollak (a little different sort of role than I'm used to seeing him in -- both threatening and at the same time sympathetic), Dennis Christopher (who does a nice representation of gradually going nuts), and Peter Jacobsen (who does already-half-nuts in very amusing fashion). I was actually a bit disappointed in the role written for Julianna Margulies -- it isn't particularly strong, and you almost get the sense that, other than characterizing the existence of The Legion, she could almost have not been in the story at all and it would have continued on as before. Margaret Cho, on the other hand, has some fun scenes as a sort of one-person eBay of the abstruse.Aside from the main story thread, what adds flavor to the goings-on are the ""objects"" themselves -- the everyday items that have become, in this reality, artifacts of strange powers ranging from mundanely miraculous to uniquely dangerous, even lethal. I kept wondering to myself, ""How did someone deliberately discover that a particular object sublimates brass? brings memories into tangible existence by swallowing it? lowers blood pressure when its worn?"" There must have been some pretty creative research going on during most of the items' existences.Again, a very well-imagined, well-crafted miniseries. I've seen a number of folks here wonder about whether this is going to be a regular series on SciFi. I found that it was the perfect length, with a good ending that makes sense, and I'm a little bit glad they don't seem to be trying to stretch it into anything longer. I thought ""The Lost Room"" ended just where it was supposed to, though others will probably disagree. Give this one a look; it's definitely thinking-man's sci-fi without the need for elaborate special effects and exotic locations to keep things interesting.",The Lost Room

1508186,"I've often been amazed at the salaries of professional athletes. I mean it's great that they have the abilities that they do and can perform unlike anyone else out there. But to be paid millions of dollars to basically play a game? I'm more concerned that the guy cleaning out the septic tank gets paid better than an athlete. Which one would you rather depend on?This brings us to the new release MONEYBALL. Brad Pitt stars in this real life story of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics in 2001. The A's have just lost their three best players to teams that could afford to pay them higher salaries. The home office just doesn't have the money to compete with bigger cities that offer bigger paychecks. So how can a team that spends close to $30 million compete with a team that costs $130 million?Billy finds the answer by sheer chance. While discussing possible trades in Cleveland he watches as the head men keep deferring to a fresh looking young guy named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Cornering him later on Brand explains to him that teams far too often look for players rather than points. They seek out and pay stars for their attraction quotient but never look to see if they can justify their salaries with their abilities. Brand believes that a great team could be made of semi-decent players, but players who score runs.Beane embraces the idea much to the consternation of the talent scouts and the team's coach Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He bypasses their recommendations and instead puts together a team based on stats that Peter puts together for him. In so doing he believes the team may have no major stars but they will have a winning season. Too bad everyone attempts to stop him rather than go along.Beane and Howe butt heads as to who will play where and when. Eventually Beane puts Howe into a position where he has no option but to place the players he wants where he wants them. That's when the team suddenly begins to win and win big going so far as to break previous records of consistent wins.Based on the book of the same name, MONEYBALL is an interesting film about a subject that along with apple pie is near and dear to the hearts of most American's, baseball. We romanticize about the players; we celebrate the victories and losses of our favorite teams. But how many people actually consider what it takes to put together a winning team? That is the main subject behind this film.But it's more than discussing the choice of winning versus the romantic notion of pure athleticism that makes us love the game. The movie is about a man pushed into a corner who needs to find a way to bring home a winning team without being able to spend the money that bigger cities can afford and who more or less succeeds in doing so. After Beane went on to create this format other teams followed with more success.Brad Pitt is an actor that could easily fall back on his good looks and make movies that offer little depth but plenty of eye candy for the ladies. Instead he takes risks now and then with movies that show he is a better actor than many would give him credit for. The subtle style he offers here as Beane makes you believe you are watching the man instead of an actor portraying him and that's the sign of an actor worth watching.Hill steps out of the comic foil he's played in nearly every movie he's ever made. Instead he's the straight man here, the character (based on several real life individuals) that comes up with the plan that just might save the A's. He never gives this performance the same old styling that he's used before, instead making this character as believable as Pitt's Beane.You don't have to be a baseball fanatic to enjoy this movie but it wouldn't hurt. More action takes place off the field than on. In any event what you will end up with is an evening's entertainment that is worth the effort to take the movie home. Not only will you want to consider renting this one, it might actually be worth adding to your collection. I know I'll be watching it more than once.",N/A

1462069,"This is a film by director Justin Curzel who, with Warp Pictures, had to get reporting restrictions lifted on the real life case that this film depicts, in order to screen his work. It is about the `Bodies in Barrels' murders that took place in South Australia between 1992 and 1999. In the film we start with a low rent family in Adelaide's suburbs, a place that is beyond bleak, full of slots, smokes and squalor.  The mother (Elizabeth Harvey) has three sons and an elder one (half brother) who comes in later. They have a `special uncle' who lives across the road, and whilst he seems to be interested in Elisabeth, he is actually abusing the young boys. She finds out and goes `ape' to coin an oft used vernacular.Enter new guy John Bunting (Daniel Henshall) he appears as a knight in rusting armour and sets about ousting the paedophile. Now ensconced as a vigilante hero, he takes on the mantle of local moral guardian and enlists the help of others in his `work'. Jamie (Lucas Pittaway) is sixteen and has more troubles than most of that age, John decides he needs to `grow a pair' and thus he gets sucked into a world of violence, torture and murder.This is a beautifully shot film and has been accused of being too arty, lingering shots, periods of no dialogue etc. However the seeming ordinariness of those moments is the perfect juxtaposition for the brutal things that are happening on screen. All of the actors are totally convincing, even the world ropiest transvestite and the guy with learning difficulties. The music is minimal but potent and we have a full grotesquery of supporting characters, plus scenes of kangaroo butchery which is pretty disturbing.I was so gripped by this that I felt I had only been watching for about an hour when it had finished, when this is a two hour film. I then checked out the real case and it is actually worse than what the film depicts, which is probably a good thing. The film leaves it up to the viewer to judge the people and whilst you are clear who the guilty parties are, as things progress the clear lines of guilt and innocence get blurred to beyond recognition.Once again Screen Australia has brought us an excellent film that whilst many will find disturbing still  makes a powerful statement and an engrossing film into the bargain. I can only recommend with the caveat that the violence is disturbing, but despite that is far from gratuitous, this is not `torture porn'. If you find this to your liking then `Animal Kingdom' will be one you might enjoy too.",Snowtown

1420894,"We've had Tucker & Dale vs. Evil sitting in our Netflix queue for awhile. One of our friends liked it so much that - during the movie - she sent us a note encouraging us to see it.  You don't get that kind of endorsement every day, so we set aside time to watch it.  We were not disappointed.Where to start?  I was crestfallen when Reaper went off the air, so I was delighted to see Tyler Labine back in lovable form as Dale, a hillbilly with a heart of gold. His love interest is the gorgeous but underused Katrina Bowden (of 30 Rock) as Allison. Dale's best friend Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and a bevy of college morons rounds out the cast.  The college kids are off to a party in the woods which just happens to coincide with Tucker and Dale's plans to revamp their ""vacation home."" When the two groups meet at a gas station - Dale forgets to put down the scythe in his hands when he tries to politely meet the college beauties - things don't go well.If this sounds like the plot of a typical horror movie (well, minus the ""vacation home"" part), it is.  When Tucker and Dale visit the rundown cabin it's a spitting image of the cabin from Evil Dead. It seems the cabin is in the same area as The Memorial Day Massacre, which Chad (Jesse Moss) recounts in curiously lurid detail.  It's not long before everyone decides to go skinny dipping (of course). Things go hilariously wrong from there.Tucker & Dale alternates between showing typical horror tropes from the college kids' perspective and then giving them perfectly innocent (if unlikely) explanations for them from the hillbillies' perspective. The college kids are convinced the hillbillies are the murderers from the Memorial Day Massacre. Conversely, it's not long before the two buds are convinced the kids are part of a suicide pact, hell-bent on taking everyone with them.The movie pivots on the relationship between Dale and Allison; less likeable leads would have ruined the movie, but here they're both terrifically cute in a film dripping with gore. As appealing though the burgeoning romance between the furry hillbilly and the blonde college co-ed is, it's the best friends who really cement the movie. Tucker and Dale's relationship never flags even when one of them starts losing appendages.The one element that works against the film is the titular ""Evil"" of the title.  It's not hard to spot who is the real villain and unfortunately Tucker & Dale telegraphs him a little too early.  That doesn't detract from the careful plotting and clever script, which delivers on all its promises.Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a love letter to cult horror fans that's not afraid to throw a little love into the plot too.  If you're a fan of Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, or any of their successors you won't be disappointed.",N/A

There are tons of giant robot animes out there, and most of them are pretty average. This one rises above the average series in the Mech genre. The animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all great. There are lots of really cool and memorable characters. This anime also has tons of action, drama, comedy, romance, and fanservice. It's not for kids. There is some strong language, nudity, and some suggestive stuff herein. Overall, this anime is great. It reminded me of Gundam Seed Destiny, RahXephon, and Full Metal Panic.

1062276,"I don't consider myself to be a  big fan of westerns, but ""Deadwood"" is a show that I've never tired of after several viewings - I can watch the entire series (3 seasons) every year or so - great story, great cast, great acting.Be forewarned that this is not a ""family"" show, nor is it for the faint of heart - almost every episode is laced with profanity, violence and all manner of illicit activity. It would be easy to write this show off as gratuitous, but at its core, ""Deadwood"" has compelling, extremely well written storylines (at least for the first two seasons).  On the one hand, it's too bad they didn't tone down some of the ""raw"" aspects of this show because it may have garnered a bigger audience (most of the negative reviews you'll see here are for series' abrasive content), but then on the other hand it wouldn't be ""Deadwood"" without it. In the extra features, Milch and company do explain why the show is presented the way it is - also telling is Milch's lament as to why the series was terminated after just three seaons (credit to HBO for including Milch's ""rant"" in the extras).If you can look past the ""grit,"" the first two seasons of ""Deadwood"" rank amongst the finest shows HBO has ever offered. Less so the third season, but it is still watchable.Anyway, I'm glad I held out until the complete series came to Blu Ray - it just looks and sounds stellar. All of the bonus features from the various DVD collections have been ported over, and it looks like they are all in hi-def too. Not critical, but a nice perk.

664604,"I just watched this movie for the second time, in many, many years. I first saw it when it first came out, and I remember I did not like it back then. I recently found out a 4th and 5th installment where made, so I decided to check out the first 3 to refresh my memory before checking out 4 & 5. Well, I only recalled bits and pieces, but yup, same conclusion as all those years ago when I first saw it. This time around, some army guys are experimenting with the zombie chemicals from the barrels (as in the barrels from the first two movies). One of the scientists on the team's on steals his security card and breaks into the facility with his girlfriend to find out what they are doing there. They discover his father is using the chemical to bring back the dead, and to experiment on a way to destroy them when they do reanimate.The son ends up having an argument with his father, and he runs away with his girlfriend on his motorbike. However, they have a bike accident that kills his girlfriend. And in desperation he takes her body to the facility and brings her back using the zombie chemical. Now she is back, but she is a zombie, and she too wants brains. And anyone she bites, will become a zombie too.Out of all the 4 ROTLD movies, this one is my least favorite. That's including parts 4 & 5. In each of the movies, there are some pretty lame scenes and acting, but this one seems to take the cake. Mostly it comes from the starring zombie role of whomever she is playing her. She really does and acts in some pretty nauseating ways. Some say this was the goriest version of the 5 movies. But you know what, I don't care, gore does not make a movie great. This one's ending was the worst of them all too. Even tho it stayed more truer to the first two movies then the next two, it still had moments of WTF about it. Why bother to do this, only to end up like this and that, seeing the movie for yourself, you will understand what I mean by that.In my collection, sometimes I like to just have all the movies to complete a collection, but sometimes I make an exception, and I would never have bothered to purchase Robocop 3 or Police Academy 7 had they not come in box sets with all the movies. If the Return of the Living Dead came in a box set, I would have bought it, provided it contained all 5 movies, or parts 2 to 5 or whatever, but these movies are all individual, and I am glad I did not pay money for this 3rd movie with it's horrible made in the early 90's stupid futureistic-wanna-be silo facilities with fluorescent stage lighting with Star Trek sliding doors all the place that are supposed to be top secret facilities. Also in this film, you have come to expect to see zombies come back from the dead, in bone and flesh form, but this movie failed to bring anyone dead back apart from the main girl. Everyone else was just infected by a bite and the best you get is a guy with his dead on his exposed spine. It really felt like they had a small budget and this film was not all it could have been visually. And again, they really needed some better actors, most where just annoying and did not take their roles serious enough to pull off a great B-grade horror comedy.",N/A
789153,"This is a powerful movie. It is sort of a gothic horror movie, shot in black and white, starring Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann in the two lead roles.'Hour of the wolf' offers a view into the life of Johan, an artist, who lives with his wife Alma and who begins to sink more and more into a world of threatening delusions, not being able any more to resist them.The movie is compact and generally well structured, with several memorable, intense scenes.An uncanny and oppressive atmosphere and tension is very well developed. Von Sydow's acting is good. The people of the castle are well casted, and their acting is convincing.Themes are insanity and losing the ability to resist your delusions, your inner demons.And also: vulnerability, (unconditional) love, and humiliation.Its unheimlich and uncanny atmosphere, somehow coming so close, hit some inner nerves in me which other movies left untouched. I consider this movie (though it has its flaws) a valuable artistic achievement of Ingmar Bergman.I do not really understand why this movie has such appeal. Weeks or even months after the first viewing `the feel' of the movie repeatedly surfaced within me, and the wish to see it once more got stronger and stronger. After a second viewing my enthusiasm was confirmed and it still holds a special place in the spectrum of my inner experiences.Some reviewer wrote that this movie `has tremendous depths if you are willing to go there'.For optimal effect: watch it alone in the middle of the night.",N/A

You're guaranteed to have a hit show when it appeals to any female on Earth old enough to watch ""Cinderella"" or ""Beauty and the Beast.""ABC Studios released ""Once Upon A Time: The Complete First Season,"" giving people who have a hard time keeping up with television program schedules a chance to take in the series at their own pace. It won't take but one or two episodes to get a viewer hooked. They'll soon find themselves zooming through the episodes one after the next in anticipation.A boy named Henry (Jared Gilmore) shows up on Emma Swan's (Jennifer Morrison) doorstep. He claims to be the son she gave up for adoption ten years earlier. Henry shares a theory with her as she drives him home to the little town of Storybrooke, Maine. He believes all the citizens of Storybrooke are fairy tale characters living under a curse his adopted mother and mayor of the town, Regina (Lana Parrilla), put them under. Henry is certain Regina is the wicked witch from the story of ""Snow White."" The boy believes Emma is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) and she is destined to lift the curse Regina put on the town.It's amazing how well writers for this show mash together all the fairy tales we grew up reading, hearing, and seeing. It's a complex storyline that interweaves so many mythical characters you literally just sit there at times wondering who or what is going to show up next. It truly is a soap opera for fairy tale lovers.Being a comic book fan, I can't help but bring up the similarities ""Once Upon A Time"" has to Bill Willingham's graphic novel series ""Fables."" The book has been around since 2002 and ABC even optioned the comic at one point to develop it for television. It's hard to believe years later they just happened to come up with a similar concept.Producers claim they hadn't read any of the issues before they created the show. Strangely, the series has issues of Marvel Comics lying around different scenes as if they're taking shots at DC and Vertigo Comics who published ""Fables."" DC and Marvel are known to be competitors in the comic book world.Consumers and fans of the show will be happy with the bonus material found on the Blu-ray release of the series. There are several featurettes including ""'Once Upon A Time:' Origins,"" ""Fairy Tales in the Modern World,"" ""Building Character,"" ""Welcome to Storybrooke,"" and ""The Story I Remember... 'Snow White.'"" Other extras found are ""Fairest Bloopers of Them All,"" audio commentaries, and deleted scenes.The Blu-ray version of ""Once Upon A Time"" contains all 22 episodes of the series on five discs. The special features are spread throughout the discs. I recommend this for any fairy tale buffs and even enthusiasts of the dark fantasy and horror genres.",Once Upon a Time: Season 1

251932,"Well I just watched this for the first time last night and I am still trying to figure out what is so damn special about this movie.  After hearing countless positive reviews about this movie I decided to see for myself what all the hype was about.  In a world of countless bad romantic dramady's I was expecting Say Anything to be a moving unsentimetal view of a new relationship.  This is little more than your standard chick flick.  Not to say that this is Katherine Heigle chick flick bad,  but its also not a very original depiction of a new budding romance.  Thier were scenes in this movie that made me cringe because of its cornyness.  This would all be fine if I were a 17 year old girl but I happen to be a 30 year old man,  and when a movie gets this much acclaim it should speak to all demographics.  I am not trying to say that Say Anything is an abysmal mess but I do think that it might have been a more original movie in 1989 and has not been able to stand the test of time.",Say Anything VHS

1081872,"This Universal two pack,on two single discs,features Dawn of the Dead(released Mar/04)and Land of the Dead(released June/05),both in their director cuts.It doesn't mean they are any better,just a little longer.Both films were shot in and around Toronto,with the first having a majority of its cast from Canada.The second uses mostly Canadian supporting players while the films leads are mostly Americans.Dawn of the Dead finds Sarah Polley as the lead character,playing a nurse who comes home from a hard day at the hospital.The next morning the world has turned upside down as many of the populace have become walking zombies and she must flee for her life.She ends up in an accident in transit but meets up with policeman Ving Rhames.Together they follow some other folks to the local mall.They are only safe for a little while on the main floor and eventually are forced to make their way up to the second level.There some security guards have already taken control,and it takes some time for them to acquiesce to let them in.Once in they go about making their surroundings more secure and even allow the entry of a truck load of survivors from the outside.Eventually they formulate a plan to cross the city to a marina and commandeer one of the occupants boats to sail to an island offshore.Things do not go smoothly(do they ever?)as they have to stalk up on ammunition,which sits in a gun shop across from the mall.The owner of the shop has been on the roof and in contact with them since almost the beginning.He however has gotten very hungry.To alleviate his discomfort they send a dog with food in packs over to the store.The owner lets the dog in through a small opening but neglects to secure it.The zombies follow in and take care of him.One of the survivors takes a truck and goes over to rescue her dog but gets trapped herself.It is now up to the group to rescue her,which they do.They stock up on their ammo and leave in two large mall buses,maxed out with heavy reinforced siding and other steel product.Alot of ups and downs for the group later,they finally arrive at the marina and leave on the boat.The end credits show us that their journey and arrival to the island is not as idyllic a happy ending as any of them would have wanted.This film has quite the plot gaps throughout and one must assume and/or accept certain situations in situ,sometimes too much.For instance,among the group there is a couple,and the woman is pregnant.Most the way through she is fine but suddenly somewhere along the line she has been turned into a zombie;with no explanation as to the how and why of her turning,as no zombies ever reached the 2nd level.In another scene,one of the buses transporting part of the group to the marina,overturns.During that time one of the passengers is brandishing a chain saw which is on.As the bus flips we see him cutting into a woman,and presumably killing her.When we next see him he is dead also.Did the saw kill him too or was it just the bus flip? However it happened,it seemed like a very contrived way of disposing of two characters.On top of all this,one must explain how in the world the group trapped in the mall managed to come up with all of the equipment and armour they attached to those mall buses.AND with razor wire to boot!!? What mall sells that kind of hardware and razor wire? The plot is,speaking of wire,razor thin.The film just never seems to find its Zen and pull us into its realm to any great length.However it was nice to see Canadian actors Matt Frewer and Jayne Eastwood,a pair I hadn't seen for quite some time.Only 2 1/2 to maybe three stars,at best.Land of the Dead has at the helm the zombie meister himself,legendary George Romero.This plot finds a city at siege with zombies(surprise).One Mr Kaufmann,played by Dennis Hopper,lives in a city high rise and has surrounded a certain area outside the tower with fencing/barricades to keep the zombies at bay and out.Only the elite,ie.those with power and money,get to reside IN the tower,called Fiddlers Green.The rest of the rabble live outside the tower and inside the barricades.One Riley Denbo,played by Simon Baker,works for Kaufmann and heads up a special group that drives the heavily armoured Dead Reckoning,which keeps the surviving citizenry safe,fed and with medical supplies as needed.However the zombies in this film have gotten smart and one in particular,a gas attendant,teaches and leads the hordes to not only fight back,but leads an armed rebellion and siege on the city and the tower.In the meantime Denbo's second in command,Cholo,played by John Leguizamo,has decided its time to retire and asks Kaufmann not only for his back pay but a suite in the tower.When Kaufmann rejects his requests Cholo highjacks the Dead Reckoing and intends to level the tower if he isn't paid his money.Kaufmann directs Denbo to recover the vehicle,but the zombies by this time have reached the city limits and are storming the tower.By the time Denbo finally gets the truck in hand the zombies have entered the tower and are in the process of getting to and killing Kaufmann.Denbo rushes back and while it is too late for his old boss,he has saved the lives of a good many friends and assorted citizenry.The zombies,job done,leave the city to the living.Denbo and the surviving group head north to Canada.This film,along with having the Romero""touch"" has alot better actors/acting going for it than the other film in this set along with a more compelling plot.The plot here is given a nice twist with the zombies getting ""educated"".There are also a few funny/campy moments,such as a shot of three lone zombie musicians in a gazebo,still holding their instruments,and in fact one still blowing his tuba!Another where patrons get to take pictures with two tied up zombies.And watch closely at those two zombies,as they are none other than Simon Pegg and his Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright!! It seems George Romero so liked Pegg's movie he invited them both over to Toronto to have a cameo role in his!With Romero at the helm this movie couldn't miss and though not perfect,I rate it around the 3 1/2-4 star mark.Technically speaking both films are in a w/s a/r of 2:35:1,and both are clear and crisp.The list of extras on each disc is too long to even begin to list.Both contain featurettes on their making,special effects,deleted scenes,director commentaries,etc,etc.In other words enough to please the most discriminating of fans.In conclusion while Dawn of the Dead I found a bit slow and which never hit its mark,and saddled with a dodgy plot,I found Land of the Dead to be much better and more highly engaging and with a better cast of actors.The price is a good one for both.Recommended.... but just.",N/A

I personally thought that the movie was amazing in every aspect, the action, effects, and oddly enough, humor. this is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time, my mother hated all of the other superhero movies leading up to The Avengers ( except for Iron Man ) and she loved The Avengers. And to one of the people who wrote a negative review about this movie, the one who said Frosty The Snowman was better, I respect your opinion and I am sorry that you lost your brother's co-workers family in 9/11 but the thing is you have to understand that people are going to keep making movies with explosions in New York, and that this franchise is much more than Marvel trying to "" make a buck "", because if Marvel was trying to "" make a buck "" they would not be making a movie that cost $250,000,000 to make plus 5 movies before that. Also The Avengers is the 3rd highest grossing film of all time and the fastest movie to reach the milestone $300,000,000 in the U.S.  which by the way was 9 days. In this review if you are even reading it is not to offend you or upset you and I am deeply sorry for your loss and mean no disrespect by this review/reply, this was just for the purpose of explaining to you that this was not to "" make a quick buck "" and that it was a very successful, entertaining, and overall excellent movie.

731336,"To say I like Madonna in film (and her second flat attempt to copy an already well-established story, the first being ""Evita"") is to also say that I would rather prefer to eat McDonalds' artifical ""food"" than to sit at a fine restaurant and eat a well-prepared 5-course dinner.I would love to give you a point by point description of how sad, boring, drawn-out and NON-feminist this movie is as opposed to Lina Wertmuller's fantastic expositive view on male and female roles, society, and love.Madonna is truly a bitch in this disaster, and the only saving grace is given by the somewhat haphazard attempt to act by her co-star, Giancarlo Giannini lookalike (and son) Adriano. She gives him no real room to stretch out and show any kind of real emotion, and he ends up looking as wooden as the luxury boat they argue on.I'm disappointed once again by her performance, which shows about as much growth as any 4th grader in their first leading role could.I want to go on, and normally I do, but I'm going to leave you with this one thought:The video? Crystal clear, and the island they are deserted on is wonderfully treated - swaying hot tropical jungles, almost white sandy beaches, perfect for two people to connect, both eotionally and sexually if they were deserted and knew that maybe one day they would be rescued.The audio? Perfect as well.The movie, the acting, the lack of real substance and horrible non-ending that is nowhere near the original ending and so forced my arm hurt from being twisted so badly? I almost threw up in my mouth a little.Internationally, Madonna can do no wrong. I expect that in the UK she is as revered as another of our USA saints, Michael Jackson. Here in America? Not so much. Her star has dropped way off the charts a long time ago.I give this disaster (which, after an abysmal showing in the U.S. theaters, the ""unrated"" U.K. version of the film was released directly to DVD worldwide) 2 stars at best.Yuk.I feel so dirty having reviewed this I'm immediately watching the original, which has a wonderful dry sexual spirit to it.Madonna should NOT quit her day job.",Swept Away

That being said, I have to say that when I stop to think about the events this movie portrays in its larger context - the violence that overwhelmed and consumed Europe in the summer of 1944, and the sacrifices of all those involved - I some how find it hollow to call this an ""enjoyable"" movie or a ""good"" movie, or any other superlatives.

1475204,"Prometheus was a decent film.  It delivered in the areas of epic sci-fi and horror.  However, it did have some flaws.  Most of the characters were unlikable and, as with most Ridley Scott films, the tone was very cold.  I was a bit unclear on the motivations of the Michael Fassbender character (I won't spoil anything), also, and I felt that the spiritual vs. scientific themes of human origin and creation came across as somewhat heavy-handed.  The film works best, I think, when it is in fright mode.  The gore effects, and the contexts in which they appear, are worthy of the man who directed the first Alien movie, and are sure to please genre fans.  All in all, the film was affecting and pretty intelligent.  The script was also all over the place, which is fine as far as I'm concerned.  It made for some unpredictability in a movie market that is absolutely FULL of predictability.  Final verdict:  Not as good as Alien, but still definitely worthy the fans' time.",N/A

The download was perfect and the quality of the picture and sound were excellent.  We had no problems with it what so ever.Now that being said...What a beguiling this film was.  When I view a film whose story or theme is based on history, I am not one of those people who go berserk is the makers of the film stray from historical facts and use their artistic license to ""enhance"" the story.  The study of his history more or less belongs with the written word more or less or at least films which are distinctly labeled ""documentaries.""  Hey, I like to be entertained on one or more levels.  It is a pure delight to find a film that not only entertains, is well done, and pretty much historically accurate to boot.  In this film we had it all.  (Note:  Due to the rather intimate and personal subject matter, i.e. a story dealing with the thoughts and feelings of individuals there is of course ""speculation,"" but I feel the writers and producers of this film did a pretty good job in this area.This is the story of the great Queen Victoria, a historically fascinating woman, and her relationship with a gruff, somewhat crude and outspoken Highlander who joined Victoria's staff after the death of her beloved Prince Albert passed away.  The story is of their personal relationship as it develops throughout the film until the death of John Brown.  This of course is a period piece and from my point of view it is almost perfectly done as far as the costuming and set design goes.  The scenery in the film is nothing less than spectacular and I would watch this movie again, with the sound off, just to view it again.Dame Judy Dench plays the bereaved, depressed and devastated Victoria.  I have never seen Dench in a part that I did not like and this film is no exception.  Billy Connolly plays the gruff and somewhat unsophisticated highlander who is called upon by Victoria, primarily due to the fact that her Prince Albert thought so much of him.  We watch as a relationship develops between the queen and this commoner.  Was there love involved here?  I suspect there was at some level; at the very least there was extreme devotion and a mutual respect the developed between the two that went far beyond queen and servant or even between two close friends.I felt that the portrayal of the relationship between Victoria and the rest of her family pretty well followed the facts as I know them.  Some have said that this is a gloomy movie with little or no humor involved.  I have to disagree.  The humor was most certainly there, subtle at times I grant you, but it most certainly was there.  As to the gloom accusation....I suppose that would be in the eye of the beholder.  Yes, there was sheen of sadness but that is only natural.  Victoria and Albert had one of the closest and loving relationships of any of the royal families and were absolutely devoted to each other.  The loss of Albert was a blow to Victoria of which she never fully recovered.  Hey, life is not all happy, happy, happy.Both my wife and I enjoyed this production and will quite likely watch it again in the near future.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",Mrs. Brown VHS
1364905,"I have to admit to being a sucker for these kinds of historical dramas, and for the period in which this one takes place (the eve of World War II).  For those that don't know the history, a brief synopsis is this: The old king (George V) is dies leaving his eldest son Prince David as the new king (becoming Edward VIII).  Unfortunately, all David wishes to do is hold hedonistic parties with his twice-divorced girlfriend Wallis Simpson.  When he finally decides to marry her, he must abdicate (the constitution then did not allow marriage to a divorcee), bringing Prince Abert.  Because he was the second son, ""Bertie"" had no expectation of becoming king - a good thing too, because he had a terrible stutter and really, the main duty of a constitutional monarch is to serve as a neutral (apolitical) figurehead around whom a nation can rally in times of joy, sorrow, or crisis.  As such, his only real duty is talking to people and speech-giving, obviously not a forte for a stutterer!The film starts well before this, at Prince Albert's first formal/official speech, closing the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, also being broadcast to the colonies.  At a time when the British Empire encompassed 1/4 of the world's population, this was a large audience.  Thus we have a growing crisis at home (Edward VIII's dalliances) coupled with one abroad (the rise of Germany and Hitler) at a time when the British monarchy is itself in trouble.  This is certainly ample fodder for an historical drama, and the world events and context of the film's story is always kept alive through judicious use of newsreel footage, overheard radio news broadcasts, etc.But, of course, this is film is not a history of the British monarchy through the depression years.  No, this is a personal journey of discovery and healing (if treating a stammer can be termed as such), which depends vitally on the principle actors and the screenplay.  Into Bertie's dry and officious world enters Lionel Logue - an unapologetic Aussie speech therapist with unofficial credentials and unorthodox methods.  The story is remarkably moving, funny, and engaging, given the subject matter.  Bertie and Lionel both have subtle yet smart senses of humour, and the interplay between them is a joy to watch.  Obviously the casting is essential here, and both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are fantastic in the roles.  One of the extras on the DVD (at least, the version I have - which might be different than the one offered on Amazon, based on the disc's description) is a recording of the actual George VI speech that is recreated at the end of the film. It's to Firth's credit that he sounds exactly like the real King in intonation, pacing, etc. (his voice may be a little deeper, but never mind).  This is the first, most obvious observation in watching the actors - they are technically great (Michael Gambon's Churchill is also remarkable - although the film portrays his and George VI's interactions as more friendly than they likely were).  Little is known of Lionel, but Geoffrey Rush, being Australian and a fantastic actor, certainly brings Lionel to life.For me, though, the trickiest and most successful acting in the film is by Helena Bonham Carter.  She plays the woman who became the Queen Mother, the most-loved royal over the last 50 years of her life, a Queen who will be a living memory for most people watching the film (she died in 2002), and a woman well-known to have a sharp wit, a commanding presence, and startling ability to hold her liquor (the last is irrelevant to the story, but is surely one of the traits that added to her popularity as she aged). Bonham Carter plays her part marvellously, as do the two girls playing Lilabet and Margaret (the former now known as Queen Elizabeth II).So, I really enjoyed this film and I'm perfectly happy that it won the Oscar for best picture.  The extras on the DVD are not extensive but are useful - an interview with Lionel's grandson Mark Logue (leeper of his grandfather's diary), the aforementioned speeches of the real George VI, and some other goodies.  So why do I give the film only 4/5?  Well, I reserve 5/5 for films I decide I simply must have because I can't bear the thought of not seeing them again.  While I have great affection for The King's Speech, and would watch it again, it doesn't quite fall into the ""must have"" category.",N/A
790942,"Robert Bresson's story of a young and inexperienced priest trying to serve God and the villagers of Ambricourt could easily be called, by a smart ass, Diary of a Country Sad Sack. This young man is without social skills, is innocent and tends to the absolute, and finds himself without friends, openly made fun of, and struggling to find the purpose of what he does when no one wants him. We learn he is seriously ill. Bresson films him luminously with a strong hint of Jesus in some scenes.For many of faith this movie might be too frustrating, even with a sort of redemptive end. For many like me, the movie might not be all that involving if it weren't for Robert Bresson's immense talent as a moviemaker.

1442613,"Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption is a bare bones, low budget movie made by folks who appear to be having fun with what was clearly a labor of love.  The basic synopsis of the plot is that John Knox, the main character, is condemned to death by the group of Apocalyptic Raiders he fell in with after the dead have risen and the world is overrun by zombies.  The reason for his sentence is that he no longer wants to follow the leader Rome, who like Knox is ex-military, but is a psychopath that slaughters for fun and for no other discernible reason.  Knox is allowed to escape by one of the other members of the group who apparently also doesn't like Rome much either (and gets executed for his troubles).  The escape isn't without hardships, since Knox is left handcuffed and is sent out into the desert.  He manages to avoid getting devoured by a zombie and gets rescued by a band that roams the wastelands doing their best to fend for themselves.  They are led by a man named Moses (Fred Williamson) who is likely the only member of the cast that the vast majority of the audience might know.  Knox does his best to help his new found friends, even though trust is hard to come by given the fact that they know of his raider past.  At the same time, his old nemesis, Rome, wants Knox found and executed, and so the hunt is on.  Of course, the two groups end up clashing and in the end this tale becomes a battle between good and evil, with a horde of the undead smack dab in the middle of it all.I was provided this movie for review because I am essentially a zombie-fiend.  I review mainly zombie and other horror-type novels, but now and then I will review a movie.  Yes, this is a very low budget movie and is very much a b-grade flick.  Some of the dialog was a bit rough and every now and then unintentionally amusing.  Jerry Lynch, who plays the head bad guy, appears to be fond enough of chewing scenery that he probably got indigestion after he was done here.  Nope, this one won't win any major awards, but for me, it was a fun post apocalyptic zombie flick.  You sort of have to just go with it-accept the limitations of having minimal budget, no real known actors, and a simple apocalyptic premise.  If you can do that, this movie is fun to watch.  The concept is workable, with a bit of a Road Warrior type feel to the bad guys with their mishmash of armor and a deluded leader who craves power.  Fred Williamson might be a bit too old to be doing fight scenes (he is over 70, after all), but even watching him do that after having seen him in plenty of classic B-Grade action flicks of the past brought a smile to my face.  This is a simple, rock 'em, sock 'em zombie flick with a high body count and no hidden meanings.  Pick your side, grab a weapon, and kill both the undead as well as the living that would kill you first if they had the chance.  Go in knowing what to expect here and you will probably have some fun with this one.",Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption

41843,"A gentle quiet film, wonderfully written by Horton Foote, and featuring a magnificent performanceby Robert Duvall as an alcoholic ex-country singer star, who rediscovers himself by finding a family.Ordinarily this kind of upbeat view could be treacly, or seem like a Hollywood simplification.  Buthere it's simultaneously rich and sparse, and even in a world where life is ultimately good, there are stilltragedies big and small, broken hearts and terrible losses.  This is that rare `feel good' film thatearns the right.The supporting work by Tess Harper and Betty Buckley is worth mentioning as well, as is Bruce Beresford'sunderstated but always effective and evocative direction.But ultimately it's Foote's screenplay,  set in a world where predictability and cliche are the usual, thatmanages to pull off the almost impossible and create something unique, tender, and new.",N/A

14121,"Skips lightly through the story pausing only when there's a joke. ""Stripes"" is definitely not all that it could be, but it succeeds quite well at hitting the less ambitious target it aims for. The movie is a friendly quicky with no commitment and no repercussions.",N/A

429619,"first intro to Pre and enjoyed the evolution of the character from self-centered, egotistical athlete to introspective, tenacious, and able to overcome deep seated defeat... great footage of Munich Games in 1972, remember McKay well and added the element of reality and the horror still ongoing in the Middle East, seeing the Germans helping the Israeli hostages was most poignant... I cannot personally comprehend the 'Desire' that coaches love to work with but this film helped fill in a few pieces, the whole concept of ownership, is this a common belief among atheletes???  Since Viren won at Munich, Pre was owned but then unowned due to the lack of participation at the Oregon meet...confusing but this could just be lively dialogue overheard at a University bar, I have not seen Without Limits but am motivated after reading the previous reviews.  I found Leto to be completely believable (besides the skinny legs!) and Ermey endearing... recommend for inspirational film and for those who have lost loved ones at a very young age.",Prefontaine VHS
1397719,"For ALL Six Million Dollar Man fans this box set is well worth the cost. My partner graciously bought it for me on my birthday last year and I almost cried when I opened my gift to see what she had purchased! Each Season is in a nice plastic case with a booklet to let you know all the episodes of that season including extra stuff which is just packed with so much. The first season has all the episodes where Steve and Jamie are engaged and how she becomes bionic herself. I was a big fan of both shows and now they have released both of them here in the states the Bionic Woman also shoes the same episodes as does the Six Million Dollar Man of how she becomes bionic. Additionally, the box that this 6 year show comes in alone is a treat and a collectable. Each time you open the box the main song of the show starts up as Oscar says we can rebulid him...it sounds cheesey but you will enjoy it! The first year I think I enjoyed the most for it has been so long since I last saw it. Equally important, Farah Fawcett who was Lee's wife at the time had made special appearances on his show. It is costly I do admit but I have a feeling it will only be sold for a short amount of time. Unfortunately, they did not sell the Bionic Woman as a box set so Iam currently buying the Bionic Woman used on DVD by season since there is only 3.",The Six Million Dollar Man: The Complete Series

986843,"Horror films are meant to scare people, but this promises much more than just cheap thrills, blood or aggressive zombies. 'Hills have eyes' throws equal amount of light on both the characterizations and the atmosphere made. You are easily glued to the screen right from the beginning and forced to hold your breath till the end credits. The gore and violence is extreme, so if you like your screen turning all red, you will definitely adore this film. Moreover, the entire cast do a brilliant work here along with Mr Aja's wonderful direction. Overall, 'Hills have eyes' easily adds to the list of great psychological horrors like The Omen, Fright Night, Cat People, Exorcist, Mouth of Madness etc.",The Hills Have Eyes
1492641,This television series is really good and creepy.  The picture was great and so was the sound.  The music they start with is really edgy and will give you chills.  The acting is really good and the plot will keep you guessing to what will happen next until the very end.  I love this series and will definitely will be watching the second season this year.  If you are into haunted house movies you will like this series also.  This television series is up there with Son's of Anarchy and the Walking Dead.  I definitely recommend this blu-ray.  I give this blu-ray a solid A.,N/A
