But when i saw it standing on the shelfs in the video store i had a feeling like i have to see it!! And i'm glad i saw it! It has not much to do with the original Blair Witch movie, but this one on it's self is a great movie! A very chilling movie and great music makes this movie for me one of the best i've seen this year. I think it's a very scary movie and the acting isn't that bad as most of the people say. If you like good horror movies this is definitly one to watch!!!",N/A

303353,"Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were brilliant together, but they deserved better than this film.  As Lucy says herself in her autobiography: &quot;Forever Darling&quot; has an underdeveloped plot and poor shooting.  Nothing really happens; the characters just breeze along from one irrelevant scene to the next.  However, the movie does have some pretty funny lines . . . in a mindless sort of way. If you need a good Lucy and Desi movie, let me suggest &quot;The Long, Long Trailer.&quot;",Forever Darling VHS

In one of Julia Roberts better roles, she acts straight from the heart, and her and Hugh Grant's chemistry surprisingly works quite well.  Although at times it seems a bit dreary, the feeling quickly disappears when you see the press conference, in a wonderful conclusion to a sweet and charming &quot;chick flick&quot;. All in all, this timeless tale is a heartwarming story of two people who make the perfect fit in an imperfect world.",Notting Hill VHS
261394,"Unlike so many sequels intended for family movies, this vehicle never talks down to the audience or has a too thin plot--if anything it is too thick.Fox not only must go forward in time to save his kids from a gang arrest, but must go back into 1955 to regain a book that had been lifted from him by long time nemisis Biff. If he does not retrive the Sports Almanac from Biff, his 1985 presence will also be threatened by Biff's &quot;good fortune&quot;.In an industry that has currently interpreted comedy as licence to make as many gross jokes as often as possible, the reunion of Fox and Lloyd reminds us that it is possible for people to be funny without resorting to crude humor.Fox is the usually likeable boy---and girl next door(he plays his daughter Marlene in the future segment)and even when his character does something really dumb or snaps at another character, the audience members cannot help but place themselves in his shoes.",Back to the Future 2 VHS
24215,"Perhaps Cleo, or, indeed, Corinne Marchand, is an existentialist, because she faces the prospect of a diagnosis of cancer with remarkable equanimity.  Initially it is unclear whether the diagnosis is to be made my a medical doctor or by a tarot reader.  In any case the potential illness prompts Corinne to indulge in recurrent journeys around Paris in automobiles, most notably a Citroen DS, and this provides for some marvellous footage.  She also regales us with some banal but amusing popular songs.  The minor characters, too, keep the laughs bubbling, not least the alleged love interest who is relentlessly earnest (could he be developing cancer too?) and irremediably short of stature.  Agnes Varga certainly knows her art, but it is doubtful whether she intended to dutifully explore the emotions inherent in the premiss of film.  This is a stylish and knowing entertainment, not some harrowing meditation on death and disease - enjoy with a bowl of bouillabaisse, a baguette, and a glass of semillion.",N/A

491173,"Eight traveling vacationers witness the sudden car-crash and slow final death of con-man Smiler Grogan in the hills above Palm Desert, Cal.. Grogan's dying words reveal the secret location of $350,000 hidden in Santa Rosita Park, near San Diego. This sparks a wild, hectic race for the dough. Pure greed,buried treasure, and car crashes. It's all here. &quot;It's a Mad,Mad,Mad, Mad World&quot; was the most successful movie directed by ace Stanley Kramer. All of the famous television and film comics from 1963 appear in this wild comedy. Only Bob Hope is missing. The cast includes Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers, Jerry Lewis, Joe E. Brown, The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, Jimmy Durante, Jack Benny, Jonathan Winters, and Spencer Tracy. Ernest Gold composed an original booming, wonderful soundtrack you'll be humming for days. At two hours and 41 minutes, &quot;Mad World&quot; is too long, but an incredible cast and mad-cap action propel the story along. This new MGM DVD is presented in widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect. The colors are crisp and vibrant. The &quot;Mad World&quot; DVD includes an excellent 1991 documentary with all the major surviving cast members. There's also 1 hour of &quot;out-takes&quot;, faded and damaged, from the original Cinerama 70mm release. And there's two trailers. The year 2001 produced an obvious remake of &quot;Mad World&quot; called &quot;Rat Race&quot;, a modest hit. Stanley Kramer and Spencer Tracy made 4 classic films together. The last was the inspiring &quot;Guess Who's Coming to Dinner&quot; in 1967. In ill health, sadly, Tracy died just days after shooting ended. Stanley Kramer himself died in Feb. 2001. His genius is now gone. His legacy lies before you.",N/A
481277,"Daughter of Dr. Jekyll is a competent if somewhat lacklustre little Saturday-afternoon time-waster for B-horror fans. Personally, I find little evidence of director Edgar G. Ulmer's celebrated genius on display here (sorry Ulmerophiles). The movie never really rises above it's poverty-stricken origins, yet rarely generates genuinely enjoyable Bad Film ambience either. Gloria Talbott (The Cyclops, I Married a Monster from Outer Space) is radiant as Janet Smith [Jekyll], genre icon John Agar is his usual tabula rasa self, and Arthur Shields is annoyingly Barry Fitzgerald-ish as 'kindly' Dr. Lomas. The script by no-budget producer Jack Pollexfen (Neanderthal Man, Indestructible Man, Monstrosity) is strictly pedestrian, a curious hodgepodge of the Jekyll/Hyde story and werewolf/vampire legends, incorporating such hoary devices as the secret passage behind the bookcase and the monster leering at the half-dressed cheesecake model. The embarrassingly corny &quot;are you sure?&quot; opener and closer is sure to cling to your brain like an exceptionally irritating TV commercial. The movie also suffers at times from lack of budget (exteriors of the 'mansion' are an all-too-obvious model), although it does boast some terrific-looking cobwebs and atmospheric fog scenes. Keep an eye out for the underutilized though potentially quite effective red/green filter technique employed, if less than stunningly, for the monster's climactic transformations (see Mamoulian's 1932 Jekyll &amp; Hyde, She Devil [1957], or Bava's Black Sunday for its much more effective application). Trivia note: Talbott apparently was co-featured with herself on a double-bill of this movie and The Cyclops back in 1957.Allday continues their tradition of giving first-class DVD treatment to neglected films with this release. The 1.85:1 letterboxed DVD is mastered from the original 35mm fine grain positive and looks excellent overall in terms of brightness, contrast, sharpness, grayscale, and shadow/highlight detail. There is some sporadic very light speckling and spotting, a few stretches with very minor vertical scratches, and some of the exteriors and fog scenes look a bit soft and grainy, but the source print is still far above average for a film of its type and age. Extras include an overall excellent-quality, lightly speckled trailer; isolated music and effects track; still and poster gallery; and on-camera monologues by John Agar (9 mins) and Arianne Ulmer Cipes (16 mins). Ms. Cipes discusses the preservation/legal issues involved with the movie and DVD release, recalls producer Jack Pollexfen, and compares today's indie filmmakers with Ulmer in his pioneering early years. Agar reminisces about his early John Ford films and Universal-era SF flicks, relating precious little about DoDJ; genre fans who read 'zines like Scarlet Street, Psychotronic Video, or Filmfax regularly will learn virtually nothing new in his segment. The movie is gets 3 stars, the DVD package rates 4 or 5.","Daughter of Dr. Jekyll: Edgar Ulmer Collection, Volume Three"
550334,"Bandai is one company that knows what it's doing. Instead of releasing two or three episods on one DVD, they go ahead and release 9 full episodes on a 2 DVD set, for almost half the price. Outlaw Star is the story of Gene Starwind, a gunslinging &quot;outlaw&quot; in a distant future where humanity has expanded life into all corners of the universe. He and Jim Hawking, his young sidekick, are out to just make it big when they run into a mysterious woman who says needs protection until she leaves the planet. Eager to be paid big bucks for such a simple assignment, Gene and Jim jump at the offer, but soon find out that the woman is &quot;Hot Ice&quot; Hilda, a rebel pirate who is running away from the Kai Pirates who are after her and the secret she hides. This secret turns out to be Melfina, a beautiful bioandroid Hilda had been stashing away in cryogenic sleep. Gene and Jim are caught up in more trouble than they can handle as they end up having to escape from their planet, Sentinel III, and head deep into space. These first 9 episodes of Outlaw Star are mainly just there to establish the characters, their personalities, and motivations, as well as the basis of the story... Although there are a few filler episodes here and there.These DVDs include two language tracks, Japanese and English, and optional English subtitles. Outlaw Star would be one of my favorite anime series for one reason alone: The great voice acting in the original Japanese track. Outlaw Star truly has some of the best acting in any anime series I have ever watched. Every character is brought to life by the excellent acting of the entire cast. Shigeru Shibuya's voice matches Gene's personality perfectly. There couldn't possibly be a better person to cast as Jim than Rika Matsumoto. Aisha is voiced perfectly by Yuko Miyamura, who is quite possibly the best part of the entire show. After listening only once to her portrayal of Aisha, you'll absolutely fall in love with her voice and how it GIVES her character an identity. Then there's Ayako Kawasumi as Melfina, who gives her character a gentle and innocent voice. The list could go on forever. There really isn't anything wrong with the English dub. It's well-casted, as Bandai dubs usually are, it's just that when compared side-by-side with the Japanese track, it suddenly seems very mediocre.The picture quality of these DVDs is crystal clear, sharp and just plain amazing. The menus are quite average. I never particularly liked Bandai's DVD menus. In my opinion, they're too loud and too flashy. You have to wait for a long animation to complete, and a loud clip of music each time you choose a different menu selection. The extras on these DVDs aren't anything special. You have an image gallery full of character sketches and a non-credit opening theme song. The character sketches are quite nice, but they only occupy about half the screen, with the other half belonging to the over-complicated menu. A full-screen gallery would've been a lot nicer addition.Despite a few small problems like limited extras and poor menus, the low cost, the fact that you get 9 whole episodes, and the quality of the show itself makes this is one to keep.",N/A
457139,"Ever After is an awesome movie about what might've happened with Cinderella (even though she's basically fiction).  Drew Barrymore is great as &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and Anjelica Huston superb as her wicked stepmother.  For Drama lovers, there's lot of dramatic intensity, plus romance.

205772,"There was a time when the movies were meant to be an escape from reality. Durning the 30's and 40's this was most definitely true. In the 30's we had the ""Great Depression"", so maybe older movie fans notice that movies always HAD to have a happy ending. People didn't want to see a sad, depressing movie. They wanted to be entertained. And, of course durning the 40's there was ""World War 2"". And, yet again, they're ALWAYS had to be a happy ending. It's because of this, that I take a star off and is the only fault of the movie. It all ends to ""perfectly"". Everyone is happy in the end and they all find love and they live happily ever after, how sweet! lol. Preston Sturges comedy in the beginning may make no sense to you, you'll have to wait untill the very last scene to figure out what the first scene was all about. Gerry Jeffers (Claudette Colbert) and Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) are a poor,I guess happy married couple. Whom will be thrown out of their appartment room unless they come some how pay their rent. Gerry (Colbert) thinks since things are going so hard for them in their marriage it's time to get a divorce. She feels it's better for the both of them to go their own way. When the room is being shown to tenants an elderly man makes his way up to Gerry's bedroom and sees that people are still living there! After Gerry gives him the story of her life. The man decides to help her by giving her rent money and some over, a lot over! When her husband finds out Tom (McCrea) he can't understand that a man would give her money without [anthing else]being involved in the picture. I was shocked to hear them use that word in this movie. I thought it would of been a bit too much for an audience in those days, of course that's child's play to what's being said in movies today. The next morning Tom finds out that Gerry is going to Palm Beach to get a divorce. This makes for a funny scene as Tom tries to stop her, it's pure slapstick. After she tries to con some men into buying her a ticket Joel meets the same man who gave his wife money and decides to give him money too! Just so he can go after his wife. Now, the whole idea of a woman going to Palm Beach to try and get a divorce so she can marry a rich man might remind some of a recent movie out now called ""Heartbreakers"". I'm sure this movie was seen as some sort of inspiration for their movie. Soon Gerry meets John D. Hackensacker the third( say that 3 times fast!) and he becomes very taken with her and she becomes very taken with his money. He's one of the richest men in the world (It's odd how she just happens to meet him isn't it. It goes back to that happy ending habit in those days). After she and Hackensacker (Rudy Vallee) send some time together she meets his sister Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor) who has one of the best characters in the movie. When Joel meets Gerry there, Gerry lies and says that Joel is not her husband but her brother, and tries to hook him up with the Princess! Now, a lot happens, and most of it is very funny, but, I don't want to spoil everything for everyone. Besides the sappy ending, ""The Palm Beach Story"" is a great movie that will make just about everyone laugh. It's a good choice to start off your collection of Sturges movies also.",Palm Beach Story VHS
361681,"John Waters is the true gross-out artist, perfecting the craft before those two obnoxious brats who created &quot;South Park&quot; learned their first dirty words. While in the past 20 years his films have not been as visually shocking as &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; or his other early films, he's never lost his wonderfully twisted sense of humor.&quot;Serial Mom&quot; is, perhaps, his greatest achievement of his later works starting with &quot;Polyester&quot; and going from there. A brilliant twist on bland sitcom suburbia (Kathleen Turner fits the title role perfectly) mixed with biting commentary about the media hype surrounding trials (and especially since it came out shortly before the OJ Simpson trial).Waters' DVD commentary is always funny and insightful, especially herein.

Other than Callas's participation, it's  a beautiful piece of cinema, it's shot similarly to Oedipus Rex by Pasolini, so you wil enjoy it if you like Rex.

56867,"This movie is a classic and it will stand the test of time. This is the second &quot;teen coming of age&quot; installment from John Hues, and round 2 for Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. The first installment, Sixteen Candles, was more of a sexual coming of age movie whereas The Breakfast Club is more of a coming of age for one's character and social awareness. Where they are &quot;teetering&quot; with; do they stay with the social allegiances of their perspective pack, or do they listen to that inner voice...the voice of reason, maturity and human compassion that's not bound to any &quot;click&quot;. I also like the choice of actors here; I think they all fit like pieces in a puzzle and make their characters totally believable. I am in the same age range as almost the entire cast and I was a senior in High school when this film came out. Allot of reviews seem to put this film within the Junior High crowd but I feel it's much more mature than that. The very message that it's trying to get across isn't understood in real life until we get close to 18 or so. The story is simple; 5 kids have to come into school on a Saturday for detention. At first they try to segregate themselves according to their school social standings. Inevitably they find out that they are more alike than they ever thought. The movie, in my eyes, is broken into 3 parts; the first part is pure character development. This is where you (the viewer) get to know each person they way they are supposed to be seen with their everyday face. At first, they act the way they think they should act, and stand up for what they always had, with out question or defiance. They stay true to their cause never steering away for a second. The second part of the film is where the movie itself develops. These 5 separate entities realize that they are variations of the same person. They have the same desires and anguishes. Their pressures and stresses are the same even though it's generated from very different sources.The jock (Emilio Estevez) has the pressure to be on top of his sport (wrestling). In return for this he gets attention from his dad, coaches and keeps his standing within his social group. This is his priority in life and he doesn't stray.The Princess (Molly Ringwald) has to conform and obey the rules of her social group in order to be accepted and keep her standing within the group. She keeps her eyes closed; mouth shut and goes along for the ride.The Metal Head/criminal (Judd Nelson) is an angry guy! He wears the physical and mental scars of growing up in an abusive house. He hates most people, like the ones Emilio and Molly play, because in his eyes, they have had a free ticket and earned nothing...things are handed to them because of their social and/or economical standings. On the other hand, he feels that he's on a whole other plain because his eyes have been beaten open and he was forced to grow up a little faster than he wanted too or was ready too. I feel that Judd Nelson's character is the most crucial to the movie. He is the key to this whole new self-awareness for everyone, including himself.The nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) is the quintessential geek. His every woken moment is spent learning. He hides behind his grades and in fact, he wants to be more accepted by the &quot;cooler&quot; groups. He also is a little &quot;cocky&quot; about his better grades and academically superiority to the other people in the room.The weirdo (Ally Sheedy) is a loner and an outcast. She doesn't have friends that we (the viewers) know of. Because her parents ignore her, She feels ugly and without a place in the world. She is starving for positive attention. I think her character was needed in this movie to balance off the cast. It would have left out a very critical part of teen angst!Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is the &quot;Villain&quot; of the movie. To the kids, he represents the out of touch older generation and the mean spirited, high testosterone adult. For Richard Vernon, these kids are the source of his anger and agony. He has lost touch with the younger generation for 1 reason, he got older...and the older you get, the harder it is to relate to youth. Youth recycles right before your eyes, but you keep getting older. His character is the key that releases these kids. He helps them to strip away the blindfolds and to take a fresh look at every thing and everyone (including themselves).This leads to the 3rd and final part of the movie. Where they cleanse themselves of all the pentad up anger and prejudices. When the kids realize that they all have the same goal, they were just taking different roads to reach it. I highly recommend The Breakfast Club and it should go down as one of the all time great teenage movie!",The Breakfast Club
247537,"&quot;Horse Feathers&quot; released in 1932, is the Marx Bros. fourth film, and the second consecutive one without the illustrious Margaret Dumont. Thelma Todd reprises her role as a suductive vamp, as she had played in &quot;Monkey Business&quot;. And all four Marx Bros. have a field day poking fun of higher education.In this film, Groucho plays Quincy Adams Wagstaff, newly elected president of Huxley College. The first indication we have that Groucho does not take the role seriously is when he lights a cigar, strictly against the rules of the college. He then breaks out in song, singing, &quot;Whatever it is, I'm Against it&quot;.Groucho's interests lie with football, rather than education itself. Hearing that two really good football players are regulars at a speakeasy, Groucho visits the establishment, hoping to sign them on before the rival college, Darwin, beats him to the punch.Chico and Harpo happen to be there as well. Chico plays Baravelli, an ice man who sells liqour on the side. Harpo plays Pinky, a dog catcher. Groucho asks them if they are regulars in the bar, and if they play football. They go along with Groucho, assenting to each question. That's all Groucho needs to hear. He immediately enrolls them in Huxley College so they can play on the team.Groucho also has another purpose. Zeppo, playing Groucho's son in this film, Frank, has been neglecting his studies by pursuing interest in the college widow, Connie Bailey, played by Thelma Todd. She is working for the rival college, Darwin, and is using Zeppo to get the football signals. Groucho is determined to break the two apart, not because she is using him, of course, but to obtain her affection for himself.There are many hilarious highlights to &quot;Horse Feather&quot;. One highlight is when Chico and Harpo attend a biology class, escorted by Groucho. &quot;Have they started sawing the woman in half yet?&quot; Groucho asks the teacher. Chico and Harpo leaves some fruit on the teachers desk before they take their seats, as though they were little children. Groucho soon takes over the class from the teacher, pointing to a chart with the human body. Harpo sneaks up and places a picture of a horse over the chart, and then a pin up calendar. After Groucho tells him he can't burn the candle at both ends, Harpro immediately produces, from his bottomless pocket, a candle that happens to be burnung at both ends. The scene ends with Chico and Harpo shooting peas at Groucho. Not wanting to be outdone, Groucho joins in, having his own pea shooter tucked away.Another highlight is when Groucho goes to Connie Bailey's room, attempting to persuade her to stop seeing his son. Before he knows it, he is sitting on her lap saying, &quot;I could sit here all day if you didn't get up.&quot; Zeppo enters, and Groucho takes the offense, angry to see his son in a disgraceful postion. Zeppo leaves, and Harpo re-enters with a block of ice. The ice is used merely as a pass, or excuse, to gain enterance, and is quickly tossed out the window. When he leaves, Chico appears with a block of ice.  They go back and forth, getting more ice so they may enter the room to &quot;show their affection&quot; to Connie, leaving Groucho with little time to make his own advances.  Groucho's reply to this is, &quot;This must be the main highway&quot;.The climax of the film is the football game, where the Marx Bros. perform more of their hilarous antics. Groucho, after realizing the two real football players he was intending to sign are playing for Darwin, plans for Chico and Harpo to kidnap them. But their scheme backfires, and it becomes Chico and Harpo who are the victims of kidnapping. The two must find a way to escape before the start of the football game. When they do, Harpo makes his grand enterance on the field riding a chariot, and throwing banana peels in front of players, who stumble over them. Even Groucho joins the team on the field.&quot;Horse Feathers&quot; follows a procession of what is considered the best and funniest of the Marx Bros. films. The material is still fresh and raw, unlike in later films. The Marx Bros. are allowed freedom to do as they please, without being constrained to remembering the correctness of their lines. Adlibs are frequent, which only seem to frustrate the director, producer and writers of the film. The audience, however, is delighted, and could care less. We are much happier to see the boys working off each other, rather than what the writers have written. And the finished product succeeds as a result.",Horse Feathers VHS
222584,"Wire-rimmed glasses and a slight stubble of beard isn't enough to make Robert Redford completely convincing as a bookish CIA researcher, though he gives a terrific &quot;movie star&quot; performance (partially the result of co screenwriter David Rayfiel being brought in to customize some of Redford's dialouge).Also, Director Sydney Pollack (&quot;Tootsie&quot;) doesn't seem to have the feel for suspense-thriller pulp (the way someone like Peckinpah had), so &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; is a little too monotone and flat at times to be a completely successful representative of the genre.No matter.&quot;Three Days of The Condor&quot; had all the timing in the world going for it.Released in 1975, just on the heels of Watergate and in the midst of the Church Committee hearings on CIA excesses, &quot;Condor&quot; became the only box office success of Paramount Pictures &quot;Conspiracy Trilogy&quot; (the others being &quot;The Conversation&quot; and Parallax View&quot;).It's also worth noting the cinematography (done by the great Owen Roizman) is spectacular...the rainy Manhattan streets never looked so beautifully moody....and the score by Dave Grusin avoids all the usual thriller movie stabs and sting.The transfer quality of the DVD is superb, but the special features are non existent (all that's included is the original theatrical trailer--hardly a &quot;special feature&quot; in today's DVD world).&quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; remains essentially a stylish artifact of mid-70's paranoia, and viewed today, in light of recent events, contains some really bizarre echoes.",Three Days of the Condor VHS

16300,"Finding this movie anywhere was like searching for a needle in a haystack. I couldn't find it in any store and I really wanted to see it, so I took a drastic measure and ordered The Movie Channel from my cable company just because &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; was aired on it frequently.  A gifted high school student studying the holocaust from decades ago discovers what seems to be a Nazi war criminal and turns out to be just that. Ian McKellan really does look like that type of person, and his German accent is pretty convincing. The holocaust has always been an interesting thing to me; it was very sick and was outspoken everywhere, but engrossing. The entire idea of this movie is introduced smoothly. There are a few scenes of &quot;dreams&quot; where Todd(Brad Renfro) imagines being in the middle of it all. They are somewhat violent and very graphic and believable. It is the best work of Stephen King because it is an educational movie. The movie digs deep to modify the former Nazi, and it shows in several scenes, his cruelness to others that lets someone believe that he was who he was accused of being.  On the negative end, it doesn't really go that far into each subject when the holocaust is mentioned, but when it goes in-depth about a topic, it explains it very well. The only other complaint about this is that it seems difficult to believe that he could find the man that quick, although it shows him researching it. Overall, it is a very educational movie that isn't offensive much and the guy from &quot;Friends&quot; does all right and seemed serious.",N/A
559685,"I thought this movie ruled. Okay, maybe it strayed from the story a bit, by taking a nine-foot tall alien freak and turning him into Dean Stockwell, and by adding a very hot Sandra Dee, but they at least tried. This is the only instance of movie exploitation, I think, that wouldn't have cause H.P. Lovecraft to roll over in his grave. And maybe Wilbur's star-spawned twin brother was a little goofy, but I thought it had that kind of rubber-suit-monster Night Stalker charm. Overall, the movie had a kind of narcotic gloss that aided well in the suspension of disbelief. I recommend this movie highly---both to Lovecraft fans and to ordinary horror buffs. It's cool, and even if this movie did damage Sandra Dee's career, she was hot. After all, monsters, even the slimy ones from outer space, need love too. So come on, guys, have a heart.",N/A
334255,"Skylark makes a promise to the viewer and then fulfills it. Sarah is a mail-order bride from Maine and this is the sequel to ""Sarah, Plain and Tall."" In the first movie, Sarah and Jacob write letters, fall in love and then marry. They are now even more in love and are committed to making their way on the dusty Kansas prairie.Water is so essential to life and the scenes of the Maine coastline contrast with the dusty land in Kansas. Both the land and the sea can call your heart, but only one owns Jacob's soul. The land. It is where he lives and breathes free. His stubbornness is very apparent, yet it is only that he hopes for rain and believes his commitment to the land will be rewarded.As the drought hits, their friends and neighbors start to abandon their farms. Sarah keeps saying she won't leave, yet her heart is not with the land. Together they battle fires with wet ""feed"" sacks. I could smell the fire and feel the coarse sacks because we had to put out a fire once when I lived on a farm in Africa. It is fighting with nature and when you win there is nothing like it.This movie did remind me a bit of the movie: Out of Africa. It had the same quiet stillness and deep thoughtfulness. Glenn Close and Christopher Walken just have to look at one another for sparks to fly onscreen, yet the characters share a smoldering fire.The love between Jacob and Sarah smolders throughout the entire movie and is a tribute to marriage. Even though Sarah says: ""Sometimes what people choose to write down on paper is more important than what they say,"" there are some things that must be shared in person. Sarah leaves the best secret for last.If you have ever felt a love for the earth or inhaled the scent of a newly soaked field....or if you have ever stood in the rain... this is your movie! If you have never lived the country life, indulge your vision and poetic nature. Perhaps soon you will want to travel more or even move away from the city life.A completely enchanting, yet slow paced story focusing more on emotions and family ties. A story about love of family, love of the land and the chance people take when they marry for better or worse. The theme of families being able to stick together in life, is magical and very refreshing. There is something to be said for true love when it comes from a decision to love.The last scene is so poignant, I won't spoil it for you even thought I would love to tell you what Sarah does to solidify her commitment to her man and her country. This is a romantic movie, but is well suited for family viewing. Skylark is as refreshing to the soul as rain is to the parched earth.~The Rebecca Review",Skylark VHS
136718,"This is perhaps the most serious and socially redeeming film that Mel Gibson has done, it is up there with Braveheart on my list of favorite Gibson films would probably fall in the top 100 of my favorite all time films if I ever made such a list..  Real magic in acting is the performance given by Linda Hunt as she plays the part of a man most convincingly.  Her portrayal of an Indonesian insider is very good.  I am a big Gibson fan, and like almost all his films, but this movie is more than just a good movie well acted.Up until just recently this movie was banned in Indonesia and for good reason, well, at least  for good reason if you happen to be part of a corrupt government.  It shows the darker side of  revolution and reveals what most governments in backwards and corrupt parts of the world would like to remain hidden; their policies usually result in a huge class of very poor.Gibson plays a British reporter freshly arriving in Indonesia, he meets some other reporters doing the usual reporting but  he gets on an inside track that takes him into the seat of power and also into the country to meet the other side.  It really isn't a story about the setting and times so much as it is a story about the people, friendship, loyalty and the terrible realization that life isn't fair or kind to most of the earths inhabitants but that friendship and love between people are enduring.Even though the film is somewhat dark, I don't feel like it is a &quot;downer&quot; kind of movie, but it is definitely a &quot;thinking/feeling&quot; movie and not at all like the action/adventure/thriller type of movies that Gibson later becomes famous for.  I highly recommend this film.",N/A

120891,"Yes it's 1988 and Clint Eastwoods legendary Dirty Harry goes for sequal Number four. There could've been more. Magnum Force 1973 probably my favorite gave Harry a run for his sanity when others saw the scum of society the way he did, Only they decided to kill them. That's not legal. I think. Well this final episode goes back to the original plotline of Dirty Harry 1971 with a single wacko murderer. This time he's killing people listed on a dead pool a sick game which predicts what celeberities will die first. However the pool requires the person to die of natural causes or not be killed by the person who has the name on their list. So we can assume it's not the killers pool. Thus an intelligent plot with Jim Carrey as a stoned out rock artist singing ""Welcome to the Jungle"". Liam Neeson well plays a horror movie director and Patricia Clarkson an eventual love interest for Callahan as a tenacious and to inquiring TV news reporter. Excellent car chase scene as the killer creates a powerful toy car to chase his prey as an explosive attached to a detinator. The plotline with law officials against the killer may only be half alive today as the reigns have been handed down to Bruce Willis' Diehard flicks and Diehard 3 was back in 1995. I think The Dead Pool which is not as good as the original Dirty Harry or for that matter Magnum Force is about as good as The Enforcer 1976. Of course Clints aged a bit but it's much better than Sudden Impact 1982. A must see for Dirty Harry Fans!",N/A

226058,"I think that is the best tag-line for a movie ever! &quot;Alien&quot; is visually stunning, no doubt, and at times very scary. The plot is familiar, of course, but the characters make up for it. This movie made Sigourney Weaver a star, playing one of the great screen characters Ellen Ripley. My favorite character in this movie is Parker, who has the best lines. The pacing is slow, to be sure, but it helps build up the tension and get you to care about the characters and their situations. The sometimes slow pacing is the one thing I don't like about this movie. Not that I need action to keep my attention. I like suspense as well as action. I recommend this movie to sci-fi or Alien fans, if you don't mind the slow pacing that I mentioned. The sequel &quot;Aliens&quot; is even better and more fast-paced, and I'll tell you that I've been having dreams about it for weeks. By the way, I also want to tell you that the theatrical trailer for &quot;Alien&quot; from 1979 was scary, and my favorite scene in the movie is the baby-alien/stomach-bursting scene, which is a classic!",Alien VHS

Bruce Willis is an underestimated actor, even though he played in some pretty bad movies. Die Hard is THE perfect mix of INTENSE action, very funny jokes and one-liners and entertainment at its best. And there's even more; the acting is very good. This is one of the most entertaining films I've seen for sure, and it's the perfect one to watch when you don't want to think a lot and when your brain is tired and doesn't want to work. All I can say about this film is positive. It is long enough, there are no weak moments, and you're staying on the edge of your seat during the two big hours of fun that this film brings you. The story is conventional, but there are details that make this film more intelligent than the average action flick. And I was very surprised by how violent Die Hard was.

581348,"This neglected series, which I saw in its entirety on fansubs, might very well be the best TV series adventure drama for younger audiences produced in anime--but I'm not so familiar with anime aimed at younger audiences, so that's not something I say with total confidence.  There are still numerous flaws in the storytelling, especially in the middle episodes that were made after Director Hideaki Anno handed over production to his assitant Shinji Higuchi and the animation was farmed out to cheaper, overseas animation studios.  (I guess he came back for the final episodes, which are pure Anno indeed.)  On the whole, &quot;Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water&quot; is an age-appropriate series that doesn't fail to include compelling characters, a twisting, consistently interesting plot, and a grand finale that's logical and actually worthy of everything that came before it.  Anno didn't even manage to pull something like that in &quot;Evangelion,&quot; no matter what the greater strengths of that later show were.What's actually rather amazing in seeing this series is how many parallels the storyline and even the characters of Nadia, Captain Nemo, Electra, and the Neo-Atlantean organization were carried over into &quot;Evangelion.&quot;  Suffice to say that in the second tape, the middle episodes before the infamous &quot;Island&quot; sequence, and in the final five episodes--the echoes are undeniable.  (Biblical references abound, for example.)  Situations, lines, and themes turn out to be similar, and occasionally they even rival the brutality that &quot;Evangelion&quot; portrayed so vividly--though of course, this show was made for children and thus Anno had to pull his punches.  Reportedly, he was unhappy about this fact; I suppose &quot;Evangelion&quot; made up for that!  Even the infamous close-up montages of still objects that would be a hallmark of Anno's later work shows up from time to time in this show.The colors are bright and sharp, if a bit 80s-ish and slightly dated by today's anime standards.  The character design is also much more &quot;round&quot; and &quot;cartoonish,&quot; with the eerie exception of Nadia herself--a dead ringer for Shinji, if I ever saw one.  (Of course both &quot;Eva&quot; and &quot;Nadia&quot; shared the same character designer, so it's no surprise.)  Special note must be made about the delightfully Jules Vernes-ish mechanical devices--the Gratan, for example, or the intricately designed Nautilus, which has throwbacks to the spaceships in Anno's debut OAV, &quot;Gunbuster.&quot;  As a previous reviewer has noted, the influence of Miyazaki, especially &quot;Laputa: Castle in the Sky,&quot; is significant, though they're not specifically the flying machines that Miyazaki has a special affection for.  The alternate late 19th Century portrayed in this series is quite charming and intricate, in a Jules Verne-ish way again.What I liked about this show is that while the above-mentioned brutality and plot twists are definitely present, the strong sense of faith and vitality is never lost in the characters--especially in Jean, who never loses hope, even when the moody, introspective Nadia does.  Jean's optimism is believable, not contrived, and it is his devotion and energy that drives this show, even as many of the characters around him start to fall apart in remarkably similar ways that the &quot;Eva&quot; characters did.  I think this ultimately was the secret of this anime's true success in Japan and in the early US anime fan community, besides the humor and impressively detailed mechanical devices and plot twists.I look forward to completing this series on DVD, hopefully with the valuable, revealing, and necessary omake/extra bits released as well.",Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water - The Adventure Begins - Volume 1

299344,"This classic movie has aged very well -- even after 50 years it's still highly watchable and completely relevant.  Some of the dialogue -- such as the discussion about how difficult it would be to get all of Earth's heads of state together in the same room -- could be taken from today's headlines.  Also like today, the scientists find it easier to meet on common ground than the politicians!  (Watch out for the cigarette smoking, though --- even the doctors light up in the hospital hallways!  Oh well, that's really how it was back in the 50s.  At the same time, it's neat to see all those &quot;classic&quot; cars and other props.)This film goes to show that special effects (of which this movie has relatively few) are not necessary for effective science fiction.  With good actors performing an excellent script, it doesn't really matter that the robot is a man in a rubber costume or the flying saucer looks a bit fakey when it first comes down to earth.  You soon get so caught up in the story, that it's easy to suspend disbelief and let it be real.  (I'm very glad they didn't colorize this, because the B&amp;W lighting effects are a big part of the illusion.  Adding color would ruin it.)Precisely because the script doesn't go into much detail about how the spaceship works, it doesn't seem as dated as many other 1950s films.  The minimalist interior of the UFO simply suggests technology so far advanced,  that you can fill in explanations with your own imagination.  (Frankly, I like this approach much better than the constant technobabble in recent Star Trek episodes.)  Michael Rennie plays a highly intelligent alien who could be a forerunner of Spock (minus the pointed ears), and Sam Jaffe is just wonderful as the Einstein-like scientist whose unbridled curiousity and openess toward the unknown is a fine role model for us all.

340503,"When I first saw the title of this movie, I was intrigued. I wasn't looking for a movie about France, but any movie title with the word Provence has my attention. When I saw it was a TV comedy, I thought it might be a nice few hours escape. I also imagined it might have some Provence countryside and local flair.This movie starts out very slowly, so you have to be patient. In fact, I wasn't sure I had put in the right tape to start with, but soon I figured out what the movie was about. Peter (an advertising executive) and his wife who decide to quit their jobs in England and just run off to southern France. After buying a quaint farmhouse in Provence, they try to settle into the slow paced country life. This is a very laid back movie, and that is perhaps its charm.Food is also a theme in this movie. There are romantic restaurants and fun scenes of Peter going to the bakery to get a baguette for breakfast. There is a bit of drama with the bakery near the end of the movie.You will laugh out loud in some scenes as Peter is pulled along with a pig hunting for truffles. There is a ""truffle mystery theme"" running through the movie. The humor in this made-for-TV romantic comedy is dry English humor, which I quite enjoy. This is really more of a comedy, than a romance. Perhaps the romance is that a couple is trying to find their dream and they stick together through the good and the bad.What I loved was that Peter was a writer and he is always trying to finish his novel. His wife helps him on a writing assignment about Provence and that is when things turn more into a mystery.There is a good dose of the ""French language"" in this movie, but you always know what the actors are saying because Peter and his wife let you know. The cultural misunderstandings are very amusing, but trying in a way. Annie and Peter do attempt to fit in and learn as much French as they can.When they experience the good and the bad, it is then they appreciate France all the more. The ""mistral"" winds (strong winds) catch them off guard as they never imagined they would have to deal with a freezing cold environment. When the pipes freeze and they are expecting company, they end up starting a kitchen renovation, which takes forever to complete.To top it all off, people keep dropping in unexpectedly and expect to be entertained. While they enjoy the company of ""real friends,"" they do attempt to get rid of a summer guest only to have him make a choice they are not happy with. The situations these two characters get themselves into are quite funny. They also meet up with quite a few interesting characters, those being the local residents.I do wish they had shown more of the Provenal countryside and lifestyle, but it was entertaining. I have always thought it would be fun to live in France and be a writer. This movie was entertaining in that regard. I would also love to live in that house with a pool! What a life! If you enjoy English humor, which is very dry...you will love it! If you love Provence, France, this is a rare treat.~The Rebecca Review",N/A

484816,"There's a scene in HIGH FIDELITY that's so truthful and so real it's embarrassing to watch. Rob stands in front of Charlie's house in the pouring rain. She has just broken up with him. He screams at the top of his lungs &quot;Charlie, you f****** B****!!! Let's talk about it!!!&quot;. Oh boy. That is sad. You see, Rob Gordon (a thirty-something vinyl record store owner, played with equal parts charm and annoyance by John Cusack) is a failure when it comes to relationships. Every relationship he gets into falls apart. And he is constantly the victim... at least in his own mind. Rob is the type of guy who is never happy with a girl, never really wants them, until he can't have them anymore. When Charlie (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) asks him out and they start a relationship together, Rob's thoughts aren't ever 'man, she's beautiful - I'm such a lucky guy'. His thoughts are 'man, she's beautiful - what the heck is she doing with me?' In it's examination of the thought process of the terminally pessimistic, HIGH FIDELITY is dead-on. I'd encourage any man who has ever felt truly screwed over by a woman to see this movie. You just might learn something. What Rob cannot get through his head is why so many women have dumped him. He has compiled a list of his top five breakups (he makes top 5 lists for EVERYTHING) and decides to see these women again in an attempt to find out why they dumped him - completely oblivious to the fact that sometimes it isn't the guy's fault and sometimes it just happens that way. It's a stream-of-consciousness movie, with Rob often breaking out of character to talk directly to the screen, and we follow him through a current breakup with Laura (played with great sensitivity by newcomer Iben Hjejle) and through his day-today misadventures at his record store. The other examination made in the film is that of obsessive music fans (you know, the ones who endlessly debate and fight over whether or not the real title of the record is &quot;THE Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; or just &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon - believe me, I work in a record store and this type of person really exists). But the object of this obsession doesn't really matter. It could be film, books, comics, television - it's just something these characters use to feel more elite then the casual fan. It's an ego-boost. The clerks at Rob's store are the outspoken, snobbish Barry (played with extreme energy and hilarity by the wonderful Jack Black) and the quietly opinionated Dick (played with shy charm by Todd Louiso) and the scene inside the store are easily the best in the film. One wishes the camera stayed in there more often. This film could have easily been another CLERKS and I for one would have been more then happy. But the film has other plans and other points to make and it handles itself with sincerity, wit, charm, and honesty. It is a great film, punctuated by some great cameos (by the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Tim Robbins, and Harold Ramis) and amazingly assured and utterly truthful writing. Director Stephen Frears handles the films gritty look with ease and Cusack's performance is top-notch. It's a film where you might not know what the record store guys are talking about (but you really wish you did) but everything else - all the painful relationship revelations - ring true.",High Fidelity VHS

They are both bought very easily. The cast is good but how much entertainment value is there in watching a father lose his daughter to drugs and then to prositution? We can see that for free on Jerry Springer. And we are supposed to care about people who are so absolutely stupid? This film, just like real life gives you no reason to care about people who choose to be morons. This film makes you wonder if the producers and writers themselves were high.

67967,"This film is so close to real life it's almost scary. The rush of emotions one feels when watching Lester Burnham (played to absolute perfection by Kevin Spacey) wander through his life like a suburban zombie is simply devastating. The film was directed by Sam Mendes is such a serene, crystal-clear and precise manner, I can't help but be reminded of the late, great Stanley Kubrick who had a way of making even the most disturbing ideas seem appealing with his use of slow rhythms, dramatic pauses and glaring white light. Annette Bening's Caroline is the perfect shrew, but that tough exterior merely masks her insecurities (witness her brilliant emotional breakdown alone in the den of horrible house she fails to sale. Slapping herself and screaming &quot;shut up you baby&quot; before slipping back into her role as the domineering control freak is fascinating!) The lucious Thora Birch also turns what could have been a one-note character (Janie) into a tour-de-force of of teen angst and isolation. When she finally succumbs to the charms of the quiet,curious and supremely secure boy next door Ricky Fitts (the superb and commanding Wes Bently) the kiss they share is the most tender and affectionate moment in the entire film. Ricky's speech about all the beauty in the world and the way it fills you up is also a classic. This film fills me up and satisfies on so many levels it's difficult to convey in a mere thousand words. I can only say that if you've ever found yourself in a rut, or felt emotionally paralyzed, &quot;American Beauty&quot; will hit close to home. This was a justified winner of the Oscar for best picture. This movie is simply about being human and saving yourself before it's too late.",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
446114,"I am not sure whether an average movie viewer would like this film.  But, if you are into art, foreign, independent films, or if you are a film student, this is definitely something you cannot miss. Fallen Angel's strength lies in the character development.  It follows four main characters, all unique in their personalities and manners.  Like, other Wong Kar-Wai's (director) film, these characters' lives are intertwined eventhough they lead their own paths.  Outstanding performances come not only from the main characters but from supporting characters as well--look for amazing performances from the father, and the man who was forced to eat ice-cream.Cinematography, film direction as well as the music soundtrack also shine.  Wong Kar-Wai pays attention to details, imagery and symbolism. It's shot in a very artistic way--a sort of Hong Kong, nouveau graphic art style combined with somewhat weird soundtrack.

479313,"One of Terry Fisher's finest films as director, The Devil Rides Out also features one of Richard Matheson's best screenplays. Matheson has great material to work with  from author Dennis Wheatly. The writing is, like most of Matheson's work, crisp and powerful.Casting Christopher Lee against type (for a change)was a bright move. Lee makes the most out of his character and it's nice to see him be the good guy for once (although he does play bad sooo well). Charles Gray also gives a tremendous performance as the head of the Devil worshipping cult.Terry Fisher directed a lot of fine films during his career at Hammer but none equalled Devil. Although this wasn't his swan song, it could have been since everything is just about perfect. The production values are terrific. A pity that the special effects weren't as sophisticated then as they are now. Then again they would probably sacrifice everything else just for the effects (a problem with so many current supernatural films).The audio commentary is very informative and Lee is a delight throughout. He's full of interesting information about everything from the title sequence to the production design. A pity that Warner Brothers chose not to hire him for the audio commentary for The Mummy. Maybe they'll realize their mistake and hire him for Curse of Frankenstein and Horror of Dracula when they make them available (better get cracking guys Chris is getting up there a bit in age).The extras are up to the usual standard we've come to expect from Anchor and Bay--great! I've always loved their reproduction of the lobby cards that they've included in the packaging. It makes each DVD a unique collectible. A pity Warner won't license Curse of Frankenstein and Horror of Dracula (they really should--they have so many titles to reissue that I'm afraid these two will get lost in the shuffle). Anchor and Bay could do a terrific job with these two titles as they have with all the Hammer titles they've licensed.",N/A

Only 1 person can find out.. Jennifer Lopez!  She does this by entering his mind.The serial killer side of the movie is pretty uncreative and highly unmotivated. If you've ever read about or seen a movie about serial killers, you've seen it all before. You also get the idea that this guy is the guy all the other serial killers would make fun of and pick on, should all of the serial killers hang out together.  Too much time spent on why he is the way he is, which was lame and pointless.  Generic bleeding heart abused child story, where if it was true, 45% of us would be drowning and bleaching women like this guy is.Vince Vaughn's character actually says so much in the movie.  I think they probably cut out the one interesting part of the movie:  Why Vince Vaughn wasn't a  serial killer.Jennifer Lopez, as always, shouldn't really be acting in this movie.  The whole cyber-reality mind meld thing was pretty lame and unmotivated. Better examples of this can be found in older movies like Dreamscape and Brain Storm. Even Nightmare on Elm Street!Visual effects were OK, if you're into antiques, the color red, or Tool videos.

588784,"For a three hour movie, this movie had remarkably little content. Althought biographical, it only covered a few years of his life, not even his complete boxing career. There were many unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. For example, there was about 20 minutes of Ali jogging (around two hours into the movie) in preparation for the famous &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight. During these 15 -20 minutes, the only dialouge is some Africans chanting something which translated to (I think) &quot;fear Ali.&quot; This scene has no point, and I think it was just put there because they wanted to make the movie longer. There were many other examples, but that one was the worst.Also, the movie was poorly directed during the boxing scenes. I often found myself wondering who was punching who. The camera angles were often poor. Also, some characters just materialized without introduction. For example, (I don't want to give away  too much) but Ali's second wife just comes out of nowhere. The audience is never told that he even got a divorce, let alone that he remarried. This happened a couple of times in the movie.On the positive side, Will Smith did an excellent job, as did most of the cast. Smith captured the arrogance, and hypocritical idealogy of Ali very well. Also, that Smith was actually made to look like Muhammed Ali is a miracle of film making.Overall, an OK movie marred by trying to be more epic than it was, and poor direction.",Ali
227905,"Okay, so we hate sequels, right?  Uh uh....Director James Cameron's best idea was not to even make a true seuqel of 1979's &quot;Alien&quot; - though repairing Sigourney Weaver with the acid spewing, chestbursting, drool-challenged reptilian-insectoid and vaguely canine alien of the first film, and using the first story as a base, Cameron has created a sequel more original than films that don't purport to be sequels.  In the original film, Ellen Ripley is one of seven crewmembers of a spacegoing freighter owned by the mysterious (though apparently all-powerful &quot;company&quot;).  When the crew lands on a remote planet in response to what may be a distress call, they unknowingly pick up a bug that systematically picks off the crew before being dispatched by Ripley.In the opening minutes of the sequel, we find that Ripley's narrow survival has a bitter edge - escaping her freighter, she's found drifting in space for nearly 60 years.  Thawed out of &quot;coldsleep&quot;, her memories of the alien terror are fresh while she lacks any friends or family with which to lean against.  Though eager to tell her story, nobody believes a word about acid-spewing, chestbursting aliens, and Ripley is written off as a nutcase.  Bolstering the case for insanity is the fact that the mysterious planet from whence the alien came has long been settled without so much as a complaint.  Certainly, if Ripley's tale of woe and acid had had the slightest amount of truth, somebody would have heard something.  And then nobody hears anything from the colony.  Far from convinced, the compamny nevertheless sends out a survey team of US Marines at the disposal of the company's amoral corporate rep (Paul Reiser).  Gung-Ho at first, the Marines land on the dark and remote planet to find it overrun almsot entirely with aliens.  Firefights ensue, arrogance is destroyed and the marines find themselves cut-off and alone.  Ripley, once thought a nut, is now the only hope the surviving marines have of getting off the planet.Aliens excels because it doesn't really try to be a sequel to the first one - mostly because Cameron uses a completely different style.  Where the first film was slow and brooding, the first one takes the speed-is-life approach.  Cameron's aliens fly off the ceilings, jump from floors, almost ooze out of every crack and crevice.  These guys don't hide - they jump on cars, run into flame-throwers, beg for grenades.  Cameron goes for the adrenaline route, but there's a method to his madness - the camera stays smooth, and the action is choreographed so that we always know what's going on (assuming we can bear to look at the screen).  The aliens get a lot more screen-time, but Cameron skillfully sets the scene that reveals the aliens and keeps them shrouded at the same time, so we never think we're looking at guys in rubber suits (at least not guys we want to ever meet in a dark alley).  Though the pace takes a big dip midway through the film (that happens in every Cameron movie) it picks up again in time to head for a major climax (followed by another major climax) at the film's end, in which we get a final claimx, just so we can finish the film feeling jolted and bolted.Aliens is also a human story - the marines come off as amoral lifers, but they go down as heroes, even Bill Paxton as the ceaselessly pessimistic Hudson and Jeannette Goldstein as the fearsome Vazquez.  Between the awesome visual effects and the speed of the action, you'll need to see this widescreen - don't settle for the cropped and edited version they air on FX.",N/A

538527,"** 1/2 I can certainly understand why ""Spy Kids"" has been such an enormous hit with children.  What is childhood fantasy, after all, but an attempt by essentially powerless youngsters to bring a little order to their world, to show themselves and the adults around them that they too are good for something - even if it's only saving the world from the forces of evil before it's time to come in to face chores, homework and bedtime.  Of course, children merely mimic the fantasies adults themselves indulge in - utilizing the same set of conventions that serve as the template for virtually all action/adventure films that have featured heroes on the order of James Bond, Rambo, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in his various fictional guises.  In many ways, the films featuring those characters demonstrate that many of us have still not outgrown the simplistic view of the world that fuels our earliest fantasies.  By making the heroes of this film specifically children, ""Spy Kids"" fulfills that need children have to feel that they too can be an active part of a power-conferring fantasy rather than just the passive observers they usually end up being in a real world controlled by adult concepts and adult rules.Fair enough.  What I don't understand, though, is why adults seem to be so enamored of ""Spy Kids,"" which, for all its hullabaloo and hubbub, is really little more than a juvenile version of the same spy spoof nonsense that has been a staple of filmmaking since the 1960's (nicely resurrected by the ""Austin Powers"" films a few years back).  Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, two dashing former spies who have traded in the exciting world of field espionage for less glamorous ""desk jobs"" in the spy organization so that they can raise their two children, Carmen and Juni, in a more normal, less hectic and less dangerous environment.  Carmen and Juni, unaware of their parents' past, look upon them as two hopelessly nerdy representatives of an ""uncool"" older generation.  When Gregorio and Ingrid decide, after nine years out of commission, to get back into the secret agent business, they discover that some of their espionage skills have become a little rusty and they are instantly caught and imprisoned by a mad children's show producer bent on creating a race of indestructible children robots.  When Carmen and Juni discover the truth of their parents' identities and predicament, the two youngsters set off on a mission to singlehandedly rescue them from a fate worse than death.One of the problems with ""Spy Kids"" is that it seems to mistake frenetic activity for humor and wit.  Through long stretches of the film, we are being hurtled through space in one imaginary vehicle after another as the children search desperately for their kidnapped parents.  There is, moreover, an awful lot of frantic running around by the various characters, but the result is, oddly, not excitement but rather tedium.  Because writer/director Robert Rodriguez has failed to provide any truly clever dialogue, he has been forced to rely far too heavily on the special effects to carry the day.  The result is that we are never particularly captivated by the antics either of the children or of the parents, who, I hasten to note, actually spend most of their time off screen.  When they are on screen, they often come across as arch, self conscious and cutesy, rather than smooth, suave and witty.  Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara, as the two children, are unremarkable but relatively likable screen presences.  At least they are not as cloying as their parents.The art director, set decorator and production designer deserve mention for their superb work in creating a never-never land world caught somewhere between reality and fantasy, perfectly suitable for a film built on childhood imaginings.  It's too bad that the screenplay fails to consistently match that level of creativity.  Stand by for the inevitable sequel!",N/A

493278,"Suddenly, in the increasingly right-of-center autumn of 2001, this 1992 film seems timely all over again. In it, Tim Robbins plays a folk-singing uber-conservative Senatorial candidate (?!?!), running in Pennsylvania. The film follows his campaign's completely successful efforts to cajole, seduce, and flat-out dupe the media into slavishly following his every move. He gets ten times the coverage, as a &quot;media phenomenon,&quot; as he might have as a simple candidate. His followers love him as though he were a rock star.Sadly, we may never know whether writer/director/star Tim Robbins consulted the Psychic Friends Network to get the idea for his film. No, wait -- he's still alive. I'll have to ask him about it. Be that as it may, the fact is that two years after the film, in 1994, the Republicans steamrolled their way into Congress fueled by rhetoric that, as often as not, could have been direct quotes from this film... Some of the political issues raised are dated now, such as the savings and loans scandals and the contras. Nevertheless, the basic spirit of an arch-conservative remains the same today, and comes through very clearly. I was bothered by the total vacuousness of Bob's supporters (actually, &quot;disciples&quot; might be a better word), who generally seem to come from less monied, less educated families than the supporters of Bob's opponent. Bob's supporters love him because he's a self-made rich man and he's not ashamed of it... it's true, it is all too easy to dismiss money as unimportant when you have plenty of it. I think, in a nutshell, Bob Roberts' supporters in the film are people who think of America as a &quot;land of opportunity,&quot; not as a &quot;society.&quot; After all -- many of our ancestors DID originally come here to get rich, which they could never do in most other lands. What his supporters miss is the absolute emptiness behind Bob Roberts' smile, and his arctic, ruthless willingness to do anything to get ahead and stay there. His supporters value hard work and success, which is fine, but they don't see that their idol values these things only insofar as they further his own insane dreams of glory.Today, some of the humorous touches may seem a little obscure for younger audiences. For example -- when BR was made, in 1992, cell phones were much more unusual than today. The fact that Bob's staffers constantly monitor media and stock market information on cell phones is intended to satirize yuppy consultants of the time. Today, it would strike no one as odd that staffers do this. Also, a lot of the music videos for the conservative folk songs are spoofs of particular music videos from the late 80s and early 90s. Another comedic touch that younger audiences might miss, for different reasons, is the way Merilee Dale portrays Bob's wife Polly.  A pinker, more precious, perfect, beaming Republican daddy's girl one could never imagine. Watching this film, I imagined frequent catfights breaking out on the set between Dale and Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins' real-life partner and co-star in the film, who is an extremely vocal and opinionated &quot;feminist's feminist.&quot;This movie is a lot of fun, and it makes you think about things we should all worry about more. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it felt a little thin for some reason -- maybe it could have used one more subplot. Still absolutely worth owning, however, and seeing again and again. Two thumbs up.",Bob Roberts VHS
531701,"Meet the Parents and There's Something About Mary were stupid movies because they were funny.  Zoolander is just stupid and perhaps the worst Ben Stiller movie ever.Stiller stars at Derek Zoolander, vaucous male model who is recruited by fashion industry thugs to kill the prime minter of Malaysia, because he plans to end child labor.  Helping him in this effort is an equally vapid model, Hansel (Owen Wilson who usually gets much better roles than this) and Matilda, a crusading reporter (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor who will make you yearn for her Brady Bunch movie roles).  Of the supporting players,  Jerry Stiller is absolutley horrible, badly acting as the owner of a modleing agency.  Stiller's mom Ann Meara is even in this, throwing an egg at a fashion desinger.  If only we had the same opportunity.The story really isan't about anything, it is a collection of jokes and bits that are mostly unfunny.  One scene in Hansel's pad, is excrutiatingly long.  There are cameos galore. David Bowie, Gwen Stefani, Fabio, and other Hollywood luminaries, here as window dressing or perhaps to pick up that much needed check.  Hope they were paid scale.Reviewers have compared this movie to Austin Powers.  I would too. Austin Powers 2 that is.  It is as equally unfunny as this mess.

Simply a deranged psychopath (well played by a very intimidating Snider).I can't praise this film as much as some others have, but the reviewer who hated this film really missed the point, and probably dislikes most all films of this genre. Virtually no one is killed in this film, any nudity shown is in a cursory manner, not for exploitation.

I agree with the previous reviews in that this was the best season of the X-Files, prior to it being all consumed with the &quot;mythology&quot; episodes and sheer stupdity at times. On average, season 3 had a good balance between these types of episodes and the one-off 'monster of the week' episodes (which are much more fun if you ask me). By the time this season was playing here in Australia, The X Files had reached the mega-hype level, and deservedly so. It is a shame that the X-Files has almost become a mockery of the great show that this set clearly proves it once was.

The movie's setup of these relationships between different characters is well-done, keeping its focus on the children's actions and their feelings on the situations they are put into.As most ex-wives will do, Jackie is condescending of Isabel, looking down on her as a self-centered woman who cares more for her work and personal life than for the children under her care. They have many sparring sessions and heated arguments, but it's clear that they cannot argue forever, and as the children begin to warm to Isabel, so does the friendship between Jackie and Isabel begin to form. Soon, they are helping each other through tough times, trading tips on caring for the children, but still maintaining that small spark of conflict which will surface time and again as Jackie realizes her children are no longer solely under her influence.The movie deals with a lot of real-to-life family issues that will hit home with most viewers and is sure to strike an emotional chord in audiences everywhere. One of those issues is the fact that a divorce is more about how to deal with the children than about getting on with life. The movie does not take away the focus from the childrens' feelings towards their situation. At one point, Anna stands up and shouts, &quot;You didn't ask me if I wanted a new mother!&quot; The story is still about the feud between Jackie and Isabel, but this feud centers around what each of them feels is best for the children, keeping with the fact that in a divorce, they are the ones who are most affected.Actors Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, Anna and Ben, do a terrific job in bringing out all of that emotion and feeling in their characters. Aiken's character is not required to be as emotional as Malone's: he is only eight years old in the movie, and does not clearly understand what his parents are going through. He is merely along for the ride, going with what his parents say and what his sister wants, and Aiken brings all of that childhood innocence out perfectly and with believability. Malone must provide a much more involved role: her character is older, and lashes out against her father for leaving his mother and preparing to be with a woman half his age. Malone is full of tears, anger, and laughs, and her performance is heartwrenching and convincing.Another issue is embedded in the relationship between Jackie and Isabel. Jackie has the maternal instinct where Isabel is trying her best, and the story is intensified emotionally by the clashes in how they feel the children should be raised. When Jackie realizes that Isabel is going to be a permanent part of her children's lives, she also comes to the realization that she cannot keep arguing with her about how to raise the children. As they come to an understanding of one another, it's intriguing to watch the two actresses interact onscreen.Susan Sarandon is plays Jackie, who is stubborn and becomes quite disturbed when Isabel steps onto her turf. She brings out all this emotion and feeling, as well as her actions and reactions, convincingly, matching the performance of Roberts, her opposite. Roberts is Isabel, and she brings all the brightness and charm of her own person into the role while also maintaining a short emotional fuse. It is easy to see that the two actresses are having fun in their roles, and their pairing for this movie is outstanding. Their performances make this one of the best movies of the year. Ed Harris plays the part of Luke, who knows how Jackie feels but wishes that she and Isabel would be able to come to an understanding of one another. His performance is earnest and warming, and like his costars, he makes his role believable and interesting.&quot;Stepmom&quot; is one of those feel-good movies that was able to keep my interest throughout. There is a twist in the plot that I dare not even mention, because the filmmakers and producers have done a pretty good job of not giving it away in the promotional material. There is a lot of love between the characters, brought out by the stellar cast and a director whose films in this field have excelled. Based on emotional depth and connectivity, &quot;Stepmom&quot; is a nice piece of heart that is filled with true human feeling.",Stepmom VHS
559441,"Overall, this movie left me disappointed. The acting left something to be desired (to put it lightly), it didn't really have a plot, and it was unsatisfying in general. There's a slight love storyline between two of the characters, but it's underdeveloped, and was probably just added to give the movie more mass appeal. The highlight of the movie by far was John Digweed's cameo, in a scene where he has a conversation with an aspiring DJ after performing a set. Sure, it gave some insight into the whole rave-underground world, and the whole party set is really cool (they have a chill room, a dance floor, a living room, a fruit and water stand, a massage room... they have an entire warehouse to work with!). &quot;Groove&quot; is worth a try, and can be entertaining at points - but if you're looking to  experience a rave vicariously by watching this, that's not the way to do it--  just GO to one.

Although the two main actors in this film are hardly unknown (this must be their debut film), they are very good actors.

Such as her friend/protecter Lava who wears a really cool mask that reminds me a little bit of the Phantom of the Opera. She also has a psychotic little bunny thing with a really creepy looking right eye. The DVD has three episodes on it the first being ...THE FANG KNOWS..In this episode Miyu must find out who or what is murding people had the school she has just enrolled in....episode 2 AT THE NEXT STATION...advances the plot a bit as Miyu makes friends and must dicover who is kidnapping beautiful women riding the subway...THE FOREST CALLS...Miyu's guardian Lava steps up and must deal with a magical mask which controls the one who wears it...All in all VPM is a great series and I cannot wait for the next dvd in the series. I will post my review of that one as soon as it is released. Enjoy!,Vampire Princess Miyu: Initiation
447848,"This movie is one of my favorites. Yes, it's little known, and yes, the DVD does nothing to improve the sound or image, but this is a great movie. Inevitably, this movie will be compared to Saving Private Ryan. Suprisingly, it holds up extremely favorably. The story, the plot of this movie is much much better. In this movie, death stalks soldiers all of the time, and you die a slow, agonizing, bloody death. Gone are the Saving Private Ryan's cliches (Such as the wimpy medic, the New Yorker, the Heroic Captain, the Jew, and so forth) and it's patriotism. This is war, war in it's most brutal tone. Sergeant Steiner, played by James Coburn, is a tough but disallusioned Sergeant who despises officers and simply wants to keep his men alive. His squad mates are instantly loveable, and they actually have real character. They are not flat cliches, these are real men. There is no way to call this movie a salute to Nazism or anything like that, in fact, it is extremely anti-nazi. The men in the squad are not thinking about Nazism or their great leader, they're trying to keep themselves and their friends alive, as was the actual case. In fact, the SS Special Squad reinforcement that the squad gets is eventually offered to the Russian women to kill. Since you grow so close to the characters, you really get emotional when you see them blown away in Peckinpah's typical balletic slow motion violence. The villan, Captain Stransky, is played brilliantly by Maximillian Schell. Although the slow motion violence is less realistic than Saving Private Ryan, it never the less evokes more emotions. This is one of the best movies about WWII and war in general, and is a must see even for people who think falsely that every German soldier was a horrible Nazi.",Cross of Iron VHS

540594,"JP3 is nothing more than an action filled, edge of your seat, nail biting, heart pounding, jump out of your seat action thriller with `oh my god, do those Dinos look real' special effects.  With that said, why wouldn't anyone want to see this movie?  I can't think of one reason.  This movie was great.  It was such an improvement over the second one that I am now hoping they make a fourth one, and let Joe Johnston direct it, PLEASE!  I know that Spielberg was happy with what he saw. Which tells me one thing, Spielberg has outgrown these movies.  He's moved on to bigger things, like A.I. and Saving Private Ryan.  So let the reigns of his more meager works be taken over by lesser known talented directors.  Johnston does a superb job of handling the legacy of Jurassic Park.  He takes it back to the roots.  The movie is more of an action adventure.  It does tend to touch more on the themes of messing with nature and whether it is right or wrong as they did in the first one, but not as much.  Alan Grant, played very well again by Sam Neil, is hired to play aerial tour guide for a rich couple who want to see Isla Sorna from a plane.  A crash ensues and of course, people become snacks for the Dinos.  There are some cheesier themes of family togetherness as Grant finds out that his rich thrill seekers are really poor saps looking for their lost son on the island.  But the action that ensues from this is entertaining and pulse pounding.  There are many more types of dinosaurs to be seen, and the new big baddie, the Spinasauras is absolutely nasty.  the fight between him and the T-Rex is worth the cost of admission alone.  Improvements in Computer animation since the first movie allow us to see spectacular aerial shots of so many Dinos that you want to believe there is an Island out there with these creatures to be seen.  As I said beore, don't look for heavy themes of whether we should be tampering with nature as they did in the first movie, but you can count on something much more thrilling and fun to watch then the second movie.  Highly recommended.",Jurassic Park III VHS

459188,"With so many reviews given before me, I will then go straight to the point about this movie.For me, I admit that I am bias when movies are concern, bias in a sense that, no matter if the movie is from USA, China, Japan or Russia, aside from good script, good story line ,good characterization and free of unwanted prejudices and bashings, it must have GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY! And to me,at least, Dances with the Wolves can be consider a buffet. Pick of your choice, its all there and eat all you can. It is this sumptuous.Another thing, me personally at least, as an Asian viewer, who not only love and live along with different ethnicities, horse herders, nomads , farmers and aborigines along with modern cities and ancient villages, the main interesting point in watching Dances with the wolve is like watching a beautiful live documentary about the history of various Indian tribes and the Western Frontier period drama. Historical figures. Also,it is like putting me with its various people on the other side of the planet in the historical past.Then , this movie to me , is very special in that sense.I realized that the story of the movie may be fictatious, but the scenery and panoramas of the great frontier, the prairie , the buffalo hunts are visually stunning and the lifestyle and the costume of the Indians are amazingly beautiful, complicated and yet very very human,I dont know how accurate this movie is in term of  costumes and language and all, perhaps my American counterparts can tell me. But knowing Spielberg, the highly acclaimed director and his reputation, I can safely said I believe the authenticities he put into his movies.Some of my most favourite scenes are vista and the surrounding, so peaceful and quiet, when Kevin Costner in that long bouts of silent comtemplation, the Indians on the horizon line on horses, the stray lonely wolf that followed the lone soldier everywhere and the frustration and barrier of communication as well as the exchanging of gifts are inspiring, comical as well as touching.Genghiz Tanghe",N/A
698796,"Certainly this years' best, &quot;Amelie&quot; delivers what you expect from the word &quot;cinema.&quot;  Anyone who thinks life is worth living would agree with me.The greatest achievement &quot;Amelie&quot; displays during its non-stop 2 hours joyful ride through Paris is, ultimately, celebration of life.  What is more important is, it tells also dark side of life.  &quot;Amelie&quot; is sweet, indeed, but it is the film's subtle way of implying that life is not actually all made of sugar; (look how Amelie comes to be detached from her own father).  Not forgetting that fact, the film firmly convinces us that life is sweet.  In that respect, &quot;Amelie&quot; shares its viewpoint with &quot;Life Is Beautiful.&quot;Unlike the latter film, which is also a great masterpiece, &quot;Amelie&quot; reaches something very unique.  The narrative skills are full of amazing items; you can see &quot;a suicidal goldfish,&quot; &quot;a falling tourist,&quot; and &quot;a travelling gnome&quot; that really goes to NYC and Moscow!  Or picture yourself with Amelie how many couples are experiencing orgasm right now ... the film literally &quot;picture&quot; the answer (15) !!Besides these amusing scenes, you will be fascinated with colorful characters (one of them is Dominique Pinon as a very nervous guy with a handy recorder, who previously appeared in Jeunet's third sequel of &quot;Alien&quot; series in a wheelchair).  However, it is cute Audrey Tautau who steals every scene in the film.  It is now an incredible fact, but the director was first thinking of Emily Watson as a leading lady (hence Amelie, got it?) but, though I love Emily Watson, the result turned out probably better with Tautou.Finally, &quot;Amelie&quot; proves what a good cinema can do.  It is funny, it is lovely, but most of all, it celebrates life.  And that makes the film a must for everyone living at this age full of troubles.And, really, finally.

So what does the ''greatest generations'' youth do to honor them? Make a horrible movie like this. Pearl Harbor is one of the most overhyped, and overplayed movies ever. Instead of having the great and powerful war plot in Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor was more like Armageddon. It was all about the action. Maybe 1/3 of the movie was focused on the characters. But all they focused on were the two best buds and their love interest. At first it seemed okay, but the rivalry and the acting got old very quick. Ben Affleck is one of my favorites, but I dont know what got in his mind to make a movie like this. It tried way too hard to have everything for everybody (romance, action, humor).

And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has &quot;the sixth sense&quot; is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;. The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save.

237126,"During the Christmas season of 1978, my uncle and aunt took me to a movie theater to see a double-bill of two holiday-based horror films: John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; and Bob Clark's &quot;Black Christmas.&quot;  We absolutely loved &quot;Halloween,&quot; but found &quot;Black Christmas&quot; to be so dull that we walked out in the middle of the picture.  Twenty-two years later, I reviewed the WHOLE movie on video and now have a different impression of this film.During the Christmas season, sorority girl Olivia Hussey is pregnant and wants to have an abortion but her boyfriend Keir Dullea doesn't want her to have the procedure.  Meanwhile, Hussey and her sorority sisters(Including a pre-&quot;Superman&quot; Margot Kidder) are also receiving obscene phone calls from a cackling pervert.  The obscene phone caller later sneaks into the attic of the sorority house and starts killing the girls one by one.&quot;Black Christmas&quot; has some major weak points.  The film is slow-moving and monotonous at times.  The movie also lacks the thrills and suspense of Carpenter's &quot;Halloween.&quot;  John Saxon is given a thankless role as a police detective.Nevertheless, every horror fan should sit through all of &quot;Black Christmas&quot; at least once.  Kidder is great as Barb, a drunken and foul-mouthed sorority sister.  We also develop a great concern for the characters in this film.  If anything, Bob Clark's film definitely succeeds in one area where John Carpenter largely failed in &quot;Halloween&quot;: Realism.  The forever unidentified villain of &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is much more frightening than the Michael Myers character of &quot;Halloween.&quot;  The Michael Myers character is so superhuman that viewers know they would never actually encounter such a character in real life.  The hysterically shrieking and giggling obscene phone caller in &quot;Black Christmas,&quot; however, is VERY real.  Such psychotics and perverts exist in the real world.  In this respect, &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is far creepier than &quot;Halloween.&quot;  Today, in an era of DNA-based criminal evidence as well as Caller ID and other efficient phone number-tracing systems, this movie is probably not quite as scary, but definitely SHOULD HAVE sent a chill up the spine of any 1970s-viewer who received an obscene phone call at some point in their lives.Despite its weaknesses, every horror fan should see &quot;Black Christmas&quot; in its entirety at least once.  This film is a lost horror classic.  Well-recommended.",N/A
255048,"From just about anyone's standpoint, this is not a good film.  But the problem isn't the directing.  William Shatner clearly knows how to handle a camera and draws fine performances from the cast (especially DeForest Kelley).The problem with Star Trek V centers on the script.  There is an old Broadway saying, &quot;If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.&quot;  The failure of this movie proves the validity of that truism.  Since Shatner is listed as one of the persons behind the story here, he must bear his fair share of the responsibility for the problems with this story.  Creating a script about the search for a tangible God, even if it winds up  being a false God, sets the viewer up for disappointment.  No matter how spectacularly the Almighty is presented on film, it can't live up to the real thing.  In this film, He comes across as a latter day Wizard of Oz.  Compounded with that are the problems with continuity within the Trek &quot;universe,&quot; and overall tone: introducing Sybok as Spock's half-brother, and the use of the cast for slapstick humor, do not help an already implausible story.  Small wonder Gene Roddenberry did not consider this film to be canonical Trek.The special effects, which are crude and amateurish, do not help matters.  However, the special effects during the original series were often sub-par, yet the old shows continue to satisfy even in today's CGI era.  (Anyone with any doubts about that should simply check how well the Original Series DVDs have been selling on Amazon.) The anemic visuals merely add to the problems here because they are coupled to a weak script.About the most charitable thing one can say about this film is that it features a wonderful score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith. But that is not enough to save this uninspiring quest.No complaints about the sound &amp; picture, although more extras would have been welcome.",N/A
675528,"Great movie! Very accurate, well-made, and entertaining for anyone who wishes to relive those adorable Shirley Temple days from when she was young. Ashley Rose Orr does a great acting job here, although I don't think she looked much like the real Shirley Temple. Sure, she had those same dimples and the curls, but I didn't see as much of a resemblance as I thought I would. But that doesn't matter, because it's Ashley Rose Orr's energy and adorable smile that made her believable as Shirley Temple, the little girl who stole the hearts of people worldwide during the Great Depression. The song and dance numbers were performed extremely well by Orr, and she was well supported by Connie Britton and Colin Friels, who portrayed Shirley's parents in the movie. I just found this to be a really sweet movie which gives viewers a good background on Shirley's younger life in the moviemaking business. Like Cherie Hapney, I'm also disappointed that Shirley Temple didn't get the part of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" although Judy Garland did play the part well. But we're not talking about Judy Garland here, we're talking about Shirley Temple. And I definitely recommend this autobiographical account on the talented young woman's life from ages 5 to 12.",N/A
676517,"To those of you who were reading the other rviews, the review titled, &quot;PR dept. hard work.....&quot; is completely wrong.  They were not testing for alternate endings.  The whole story is based upon the greek myth of Orpheus.  You can tell by watching the movie that that story is loosely parallel.  Secondly, before I talk about the movie as a whole I will tell you why, I believe there are pop songs in a movie based in Paris during 1900.  In the movie it talks about the Bohemian Revolution.  People that participated in the revolution were called bohemians.  Bohemians wrote in the style, going in the whole idea of the revolution, of reminiscing about youth experiences, making things that were unique and groundbreaking, they tested the edges of acceptability, and rarely, if ever, gave credit to things of the future.  The writers picked Moulin Rouge as the place where the story was set because it was in the past and didn't give them any reason to give credit to a place of the future.  The pop songs are in it because the writers are reminiscing of songs from their youth, even some of its audience's youth.  This combination of pop songs in 1900 tests the edges of acceptability, and it is so well put together that it is unique and groundbreaking.  Now, this movie is so wonderful!  I went and saw this movie even without knowing anything about the plot except Nicole Kidman is a hooker in a nightclub and falls for a penniless writer (Ewan MacGregor).  I think it was much better that way.  The musical numbers are terrific, especially Tango de Roxanne(in which the tension bulids every layer of the song, I had no idea that music could add so much to a movie), and the rendition of Come What May at the end of the movie.  Many people say that the way Nicole and Ewan fall in love is stupid.  They have barely met and Ewan sings Your Song and Nicole falls straight in love with him.  Yeah it's kind of dumb, but hey, all musicals are like that, if you were expecting Silence of the Lambs you're out of luck, but if you were expecting an amazing love story you're in for a treat.  Once you get past when they first fall in love, this movie is a gem!  Those of you who are still skeptical, it is a knid of melodrama, and it's a romance, and it's a tragedy, it's so many things!

But the movie ended up surprisingly well-recieved. Kubrick had spanwed a comedy that could only be summed up in one word... INSANE!!!The story begins with Gen. Ripper ordering a nuclear attack on Russia which, in effect would cause a massive retaliation back at the U.S. Now it's a race against time to prevent a nuclear holocaust, and still keep good relations with Russia. &quot;Dimitri, I understand how you feel. How do you think I feel?&quot;After all these years &quot;Strangelove&quot; is still one one the funniest films to ever be made. It's also one of the more pure comedies ever made. It's rare you come across a comedy without the use of perverted jokes consisting of rude bodily functions and dirty sex. &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; possesses a wonderful balance of verbal and physical comedy. An example being a hilarious scene where Strangelove is promoting an absurd notion of reproducing the human race in bunkers while dueling with his malignant right hand. It doesn't get better than that.The special edition DVD pays an excellent tribute to both Staney Kubrick and The film with two highly in-depth behind the scenes featurettes, and along with an also humorus theatrical trailer. This is one of the most influential films ever made so please watch it and see what I mean.","Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"
18385,"The movie begins with the suicide of a government official.  Next it shows a young woman who spends time playing computer games for profit, and dines on pizza and chocolate candy.  Her life is solitary, communicating mainly thru telephone lines.  (An earlier incident in Angela's life made her withdrawn.)  A package is delivered, and she runs the enclosed diskette.  Because of the diskette's secret, great danger enters her life.The story tells how her identity can be stolen, and official records created, to make her a wanted criminal.  She survives many attempts to kill her, but her close friends do not.  All because of that diskette, whose secret is slowly revealed.The secret of the diskette is how a &quot;bug&quot; was installed into protection software to create a 'trap door' that can be used to allow a person to access any computer, and then browse, create, or modify the data.  This is NOT fiction - some software does come with defaults to allow access.  (I once heard a person boast that his former firm had a tradition of doing this.)Angela discovers that a deliberately incorrect medical diagnosis was created to induce the suicide of that government official. After escaping dangers, she succeeds in sending the information to the FBI, and the plot is uncovered.  (Did you note the resemblance of 'Jeff Gregg' to the fictional 'Will Styles'?)The movie's style and scenes reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock: an innocent on the run due to a mistaken identity, or stumbling into a secret plot.  The parade scene recalls &quot;Blowout&quot;, the ending on the catwalk recalls &quot;The Parallax View&quot;.  Some criticize this for copying, but I would call it &quot;best practices&quot;.

218117,"I'm a sap for a good romantic comedy and this has to be included among my all time favorites.  It is sweet, romantic, schmaltzy, enchanting and funny.  Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is feeling overwrought by her royal obligations and tight schedule.  She longs to be free of the burden of privilege, so one night in Rome she slips out of the royal accommodations late at night to see the city.  The trouble is she has just been given a sedative, which has a similar effect to that which alcohol has on a lush on a bender.  She is discovered sleeping near a fountain by Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who takes her to his apartment to sleep it off despite his better judgment.  Joe is a reporter who is supposed to interview the princess the next day, though he doesn't recognize her (extremely implausible, but alright, it is a necessary plot device and this was before TV was ubiquitous).When he realizes who she is, he plots to conduct a surreptitious personal interview with her by showing her around the town and not telling her that he is a reporter.  What results is a charming jaunt about historic Rome that turns into instant love.  There are numerous zany scenes and lots of slapstick humor, but it all works because Hepburn and Peck are so fabulous together.This film was directed by legendary director William Wyler (Ben Hur, The Best Years of Our Lives, Wuthering Heights), who chose wonderful locations throughout Rome to give the romance a storybook flavor.  Audrey Hepburn won a best actress Oscar for her performance as the lovely and impetuous princess.  It was a rich and adorable performance, which that was both captivating and amusing.  The scenes where she was intoxicated were precious and her nave view of the world was endearing.  Gregory Peck was dashing as the knave, with his understated flair for ironic and physical comedy.  Eddie Albert (most famous for TV's Green Acres) adds to the fun as Joe's scheming photographer who spends much of the film getting drenched and falling down.This film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actress, costumes and story.  It won only three (actress, story and costumes) in a year dominated by ""From Here to Eternity""(Eleven Nominations, Eight Oscars).  It is a delightfully entertaining story that is as enjoyable today as it was in 1953.  I rated it a 10/10.  If you enjoy romantic comedies, you can't go wrong with this film.",N/A

South American's accents been mocked. It all sounded like heaven. And it was. Everyone got more out of Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb than anyone had the right to expect for an independent film of 1964.U.S. Air Force General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes completely and utterly mad, and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R. He suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of the American people. The U.S. president meets with his advisors, where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a &quot;Doomsday Device&quot; which will destroy all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken Soviet Permier; and the former Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove, who concludes that &quot;such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious&quot;. Will the bombers be stopped in time, or will General Jack Ripper succeed in destroying the world?George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones are all excellent in memorable scenes, but this is clearly Sellers' show, even over Stanley Kubrick's never-better directing detail. Sellers' performance is one of the most stunning, extraordinary and utterly brilliant performances ever put to screen. He always gives the film its comedy and he'll put a smile on your face, and volcanically erupts the comic humour deep down in his intriguing characters. There are many classical scenes; the phone conversation between a woman in a bikini who argues with her bosses' boss; the hilarious quote ""Gentleman - you can't fight in here, this is the war room"" and of course that ending, a final shot in a film that is one of the finest to memory.Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb has one of the longest titles in film history, but damn, it's all over too quickly! But, since there is not a film by Stanley Kubrick that matches this one, it's a must-buy, and you'll be staring at Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb all day after you've spent your money. It's quite simply the best, most classical dark comedy ever made.","Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"

93271,"First off, I will state that this is a fabulous piece of film-making.  The direction is strong, the period recreation is amazing, the editing is mind-blowing, and the cast is phenomenal...particularly Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.  His performance is right on key and he looks incredibly similar to Oswald...just as he looked like Sid Vicious in &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and Ludwig Van Beethoven in &quot;Immortal Beloved.&quot;  Oldman is a chameleon who can seemingly look like anyone.  He becomes the characters that he plays, and his turn as Oswald is no exception.  Now...on to the substance of the film.  This film is not 100% accurate, nor does it purport to be anything other than an educated guess as to what MAY have happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  It is, however, leaps and bounds ahead of the Warren Commission Report, which isn't even believable in the slightest.  I may not be convinced that this film's vision of the truth (based on books by Jim Garrison and Jim Marrs) is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but I've done my own research and I find it to be far closer to a believable theory than that proposed by the Warren Commission, whose report was...let's face facts, America...pure fiction.  Anyone who believes that lone nut Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK needs to take his or her blinders off and start living in the real world.  Still, one cannot say that Oswald (one of the most fascinating characters in American history) was not capable of amazing feats...like simultaneously being active in the Soviet Union and the United States...though that's easily explained when one takes the time to find a copy of the memo sent from J. Edgar Hoover himself to the Department of State on June 3, 1960, which reads in part &quot;Since there is the possibility that an imposter is using Oswald's birth certificate, any current information the Department of State may have concerning the subject will be appreciated.&quot;  There you have it...as far back as 1960, there were at least two Lee Harvey Oswalds running around.  Not to mention that the LHO who was treated for tonsillitis twice during his stint with the Marines was obviously not the LHO who had his tonsils removed at the age of six.  Nor was the LHO who had a 3-inch mastoidectomy scar behind his ear and a gunshot scar on his elbow the same LHO who was autopsied after being gunned down by Jack Ruby.  There were AT LEAST two Oswalds active at the time of JFK's assassination...and many eyewitnesses have stated that they saw the police escorting Lee Harvey Oswald out of the rear exit of the Texas Theatre at the very same time that the Lee Harvey Oswald who was charged with JFK's murder was being led out the front.  It is, therefore, possible that while Oswald's double (who is said to have resembled the real Oswald a great deal) may have been involved in the assassination and killed officer J.D. Tippitt, the real Oswald was taken into custody, while his double was led out the back of the very same theatre and set free.  At any rate, there is a wealth of information out there, waiting to be discovered.  My advice is to watch this brilliant film, but not to take it at face value.  While you're at it, read up on the assassination.  Start with &quot;Crossfire&quot; by Jim Marrs, and once you've made it through that lengthy volume, move onto other independent research.  Much can even be found on the internet, including Armstrong's detailed outlines of the existence and movements of the two Oswalds...up to and including the day of the assassination.  Gather all of the information and decide for yourself.  But don't swallow the answers that are being force-fed to you...because almost invariably, they're lies.",JFK Director's Cut
676414,"I have to agree with most `Techies that the `Southern Cross' chapter of the ROBOTECH saga is probably the weakest of the bunch. I found it a bit too cutesy at times, and the storyline often took severe leaps in logic that make some of the more implausible moments in other 80s `toonage seem down-to-earth. Also, due partly to the abrupt cancellation of the Southern Cross when it was originally broadcast in Japan, it ended without really developing most of the characters to the fullest. And whoever cast the voice actor who did the dub for Zor shoulda been made to suffer a slow and painful death! Still, it does have its moments. And when it comes to my fave shows on video, I'm a completist-- I just gotta have `em all!Much like the previous ROBOTECH eppies put on disc, the picture &amp; sound quality of this batch ain't that much better than what I used to see &amp; hear on VHS. But, at least the DVDs have more eppies per plateer than any of the VHS videos had per tape, making this series an amazing shelf-space saver. That, and I don't have to worry about degradation after endless viewings. So, at least there's a bright side to the situation.The bonus disc in this particular set contained a surprising addition: the first episode of the English-language rendition of `Macross' before it was incorporated into the Robotech saga and re-dubbed! Until now, the only way to get this rare piece of anime history was eBay for a legitimate VHS tape (VERY expensive!)  or the bootleg market. This pilot has the same voice actors in the same roles, and most of the original dialogue spoken here remained intact in the Robotech re-do. Also included are a few scenes that were eventually trimmed from the Robotech rendition. Unless you're a really observant viewer of the show, the restored parts may pass you by without a second thought!Also included are a few bits of media regarding the unreleased and largely-unseen `Robotech: The Movie', most of which didn't impress me all that much. Both the teaser trailer and music video (3 Dog Night's ""In My Heart"") weren't all that spectacular, and contained only `Southern Cross' footage that was cannibalized and stuck into the film. None of the cannibalized `Megazone 23' scenes are present. The Robotech movie animatic is basically the dialogue &amp; sound track from the end of the movie, with shots of the corresponding rough storyboard sketches. This little bit of anime proto-cinema is probably one of the only moments from the movie that'll ever see a legitimate video release. Don't feel too bad about this revelation, though-I've actually viewed `Robotech: The Movie', and believe you me, you're not missing out on much.Also included on the bonus platter are several sketches of various Southern Cross body armor &amp; transports that never made it into the finished series. Most of the body armor designs are reminiscent of Samurai uniforms &amp; the robots of M.S. Gundam. And, like the previous bonus platters, this one includes a few clips dubbed in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.`Late",Robotech - Masters - Legacy Collection 5
214260,"STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME(USA - 1986)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby StereoThe fourth instalment in a series initiated by STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE in 1979, this glorious confection opens with joyous, celebratory theme music by veteran composer Leonard Rosenman, setting an appropriate tone for the entire film. In the words of director Leonard Nimoy, ""Trek IV"" is a 'caper', an old-fashioned fish-out-of-water scenario in which the crew of the 'Enterprise' travel backwards in time to 1986 to capture a pair of humpbacked whales (extinct in their own era), the only creatures capable of answering the signal from a monstrous, towering probe which is orbiting 23rd century Earth and causing havoc on a worldwide scale. The ecological message may simply be a by-product of the clever script, but it underlines the narrative at every turn, making serious what might otherwise have been little more than a lightweight, throwaway entry in the long-running franchise.Though Kirk, Spock and McCoy necessarily hog the limelight, as usual, all of the secondary characters - Scotty, Uhura, Chekov and Sulu - play a vital role in the development of the story, and each one contributes a substantial element to the overall structure. It's good to see these hugely talented (and frankly under-appreciated) supporting players finally given an opportunity to strut their stuff on the big screen, and the results are by turns funny, dramatic and quietly moving. Favorite bits: Scotty's hilarious 'interaction' with a 20th century computer; and something which happens in the closing minutes before the end titles, surely one of the most rapturous, spine-tingling moments in the entire history of the Trek phenomenon. Poignantly, and without any trace of irony, this otherwise joyful movie is dedicated to the crew of the space shuttle Challenger which met with disaster in 1986.By the way, UK prints of this movie open with a brief recap of events in Trek II and III (running 3m 30s) which is completely absent from the American version.Followed by STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER (1989).",N/A

Anyway, Braveheart is nothing short of spectacular. The battle sequences are breathtaking, epic, and completely convincing. Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing such a large scale project and Braveheart succeeds on multiple levels. The character development is excellent and the viewer comes to deeply care about the Wallace character and his motley crew. At it's core, Braveheart is a love story.

527828,"Nobody watching ""Nutty Professor II:  The Klumps"" could ever doubt either Eddie Murphy's extraordinary talent for comic impersonation nor the ingenious skill of the special effects team that has managed to bring the actor's many characters to fruition on film.  The utterly seamless merging of all Murphy's personas into a single shot is indeed something wondrous to behold.  Unfortunately, no amount of acting or technical expertise can compensate for a weak script - for a comedy is, after all, only as good as its writing.  In the case of ""NP II,"" the writing leaves a great deal to be desired.In many ways, the film's greatest strength turns out, ultimately, to be its greatest weakness.  Murphy is so good at delineating and inhabiting his characters that it is quite understandable that the filmmakers would want to apportion virtually equal time to each and every one of them.  This turns out to be a problem.  For one thing, it manages to dilute the focus of the film's storyline quite frequently.  Time and again, we find the narrative wandering back and forth between unrelated situations.  Just as we become involved in the affairs of one character, we shift over to the quandaries of another.Still, this would be acceptable if the film at least managed to be funny.  It does offer a few laughs along the way, but the film's script rarely rises above the waistline in its humor.  If a joke doesn't deal with a specific body part (and we're not talking about hands, feet and noses here), it probably deals with a bodily function either sexual or scatological in nature.  I have no personal objection to dirty jokes, but when an entire film consists of nothing BUT such jokes, the whole enterprise ultimately becomes tasteless, tedious and unpleasant.  Take heed if you plan on watching this film with your young children (and note that this isn't even the UNCENSORED version!).In terms of acting, Murphy proves once again his phenomenal ability to create characters who are offbeat, individualized and likable.  What a shame that the filmmakers were not able to craft a vehicle commensurate with his talent.",N/A

350405,"A young man is torn between being a violinist and a prizefighter. Lifelong friends since this 1939 film, Bill Holden always gave credit to Stanwyck for helping him with his rather difficult role of Joe Bonaparte, the Golden Boy of the title. Very green as an actor, Holden had a tough battle to succeed in the role; Stanwyck spent time giving him acting advice(she had acted in films a dozen years already) and her coaching was in no small part of an amazing performance coming from such a novice. Barbara is in typical excellent form; her Lorna Moon is blunt and without illusions (she usually was, wasn't she?) - clearly a woman who ""knows the score"". Much of the film seems oversimplified today with unneccesary sentiment with Lee J. Cobb in a rather overwrought performance as Joe's ""You-a-gooda-boy"" Italian pop. However, the picture retains solid virtues in the authentic fight scenes and the ""real"" performances of three pros: Stanwyck, Menjou and Calleia. In a year too rich with fabulous movies (It's highly doubtful that 1939 will EVER be matched again for the number of superlative movies released in a single year) Golden Boy did mediocre business.

484860,"Being a big fan of the book, I was eagerly awaiting the movie.  I was caressing the DVD cover as I quickly plowed through the book.  In watching the DVD, I was absolutely impressed with how very closely the book related to the movie.  One who read the book can recite the movie lines before they happen.However, as other reviewers have written, there is something missing.  The roles played by Laura and Barry were very well done.  John Cusack makes a very disappointing Rob.  He plays the role well in actuality, but his narrative to the camera is not at all convincing.  Furthermore, we do not get a sense of the evolution of Rob (please read my book review).  When one reads the book, the astute reader can see the point of High Fidelity is to allow Rob to mature, get onto the next phase of life.  This is only inferred in the movie, while it is overstated in the book.  One cannot blame the reason as there is too much information the screenplay writers needed to mirror the book.  The all important part in the book (where Rob meets with Laura's friends...Miranda and David maybe?) was crucial as it revealed that Rob had been successful in turning into a mature adult.  This was only implied in the movie, and its omission did more harm than good.  The whole notion of Rob's relationships being correlated with death was completely abandoned.So four stars for an excellent portrayal of the book (a feat very few movies can do.)  Most fans who love the movie will have read the book only on level 1 (the surface level, strictly about his relationships and pop music.)  Those who read the book on level 2 about his self-evolution will find this missing from the film.  Again, one cannot blame the screenplay writers.  With such limited time allowed for content, as well as the hacking by editors (notice the deleted scenes from the movie also being loyal to the book), one needs to lean one way or the others.  The screenplayers leaned towards level 1 which is fine if that is your motivation.",High Fidelity VHS

To be totally honest, I expected something of the &quot;Scream&quot; genre... a not so scary movie with a bunch of &quot;pretty white kids with problems&quot; running around, having sex, and eventually getting offed by some superhuman psycho.  Boy, was I surprised!This has got to be one of the most imaginative horror films I've ever seen.  The premise of the film is great and the movie itself is well written.  This is not your typical horror film.On a side note, I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that previous knowledge of urban legends ruins the movie.

206429,"you get the feeling that morrison was sorta distant and cold when the doors gave this performance at the hollywood bowl, and it's also obvious that he was tripping on acid (no surprise). this show is still certainly worth watching, though, and occasionally we hear genuine passion in morrison's voice, especially when he recites a piece from celebration of the lizard. when asked what he thought of this performance, mick jagger allegedly called it &quot;a bore&quot;. this may be true for some of the songs, but when they start playing &quot;the end&quot; morrison really turns on, and any fan of his will be utterly hypnotized by probably the best recorded version of that song that they have on tape. watch how he covers his eyes with his hand during the oedipal section and then breaks out in depraved and evil laughter while expressing his frantic desire to do something a little unsavory with his mother--utterly fascinating. this should give you some idea of how complex and brilliant morrison was:even his mediocrities and half hearted efforts are totally hypnotic.",N/A
349508,"Agatha Christie wrote &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; in 1937, one year after &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, and to all appearances &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; was intended as a prequel to &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, which itself was a prequel to the 1934 classic &quot;Murder in the Orient Express&quot;. The three stories make up a satisfying trilogy of mysteries as Poirot tours the Near East finding murder everywhere he goes.All three of the stories follow Christie's tried-and-true formula: She introduces the cast of suspects, gives each of them a dark secret and a motive to lie, and piles up the circumstances in such a way that the flying fickle finger of suspicion points to every one of them at some time or another. She compounds the confusion by supplying false leads and deliberatly glossing over hot clues. In each case Poirot holds his cards close to his vest, tantalizes the reader/listener with cryptic comments, and finds the most inconsequential-appearing facts to be highly significant. Eventually Poirot airs everyone's dirty laundry, explains his chain of deductive reasoning, reconstructs the crime in all its improbable complexity, and gets a confession.Of the three stories, however, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; presents the most feasible modus operandi for the murder, as well as the most likely motivation for murder. This is a roudabout way of saying that &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; is the most realistic of the three.The Peter Ustinov movie stays faithful to the plot and gives the viewer some excellent scenes of Egyptian ruins along the Nile.  The star-studded cast turns in good performances.  Having first seen David Suchet as Poirot, I could not help but be somewhat disappointed with Peter Ustinov as Poirot.  Of all the Poirot movies starring Ustinov, however, this is the best.",Death on the Nile VHS
312205,"'Andrei Rublev' is one of the most beautiful and disturbing meditations upon faith I have ever witnessed. As a film it is consistently astonishing - so many of the images are unforgettable, the musical score is fragile and haunting, and the overall conception so inspiring that, personally speaking, it restored my faith in the power of film.  Along with Tarkovsky's other works, 'Rublev' is more akin to poetry than to simple narrative prose. Rather than approaching it as a regular film, I find it helpful to imagine that I'm about to enter an art gallery and view an exhibition by a master.  It repays repeated viewings, and it is not a film to hurry you along with the urgencies of plot - Tarkvovsky, as he often states in his writings, is concerned with  the nature and effect of time in the context of cinema - the pace then is contemplative.  There are few if any commercial considerations motivating the making of this film, so unsurprisingly it inhabits a world entirely alien to that of mainstream Hollywood.*The opening scene reveals a Russian Icarus attempting to 'fly'. His faith must overcome not only his own fear, but the wrath of others who find his ambition threatening. He escapes and we inhabit his point of view, one approximating that of God perhaps, Tarkovsky depicting the landscape and its people as something suddenly abstract. The frighteningly primitive hot air balloon inevitably fails, and as it hisses in its final resting place it appears as something organic, like some grotesque human organ proving its mortality.  The soundtrack throughtout this scene is particularly evocative.*After this the monk, Andrei Rublev, is introduced and a series of events demonstrates and tests his faith in himself, in God, and in other human beings. Images of the worst cruelty and barbarism are juxtaposed with ideas of transcendent beauty - at one point the whitened interior of a pavillion is inexplicably filled with softly floating feathers and down (this looks likes snow, but the commentary tells otherwise); at another, a peasant village is drawn as if from a painting by Bruegel; a pagan ritual has torch fires flashing through a nocturnal forest. From these backgrounds emerge sounds that seem almost supernatural - the lone female voice that comes intermittently, her song like the most delicate filament imaginable, being the one that stays with me most.*The final scene is truly climactic. A boy, who is alone in the world, apparently leans on knowledge passed on from his father in order to fashion a magnificent bell for his ruler - in so doing he is risking his life, for he will be killed if the bell is not resonant. The construction of this bell is enthralling, the firing of the metal and the pouring, spectacular. Ultimately it is revealed, however, that the boy has not placed his faith in his father, but in himself, in his art, and, it is implied, in God.  Rublev comforts the child and this moment serves as an epiphany after which Rublev's faith in his own vocation is restored. The film erupts into colour at its close, as we are left with ravishing images of Orthodox iconography, Rublev's faith made incarnate.*If this film appeals, then it is easy to recommend Tarkovsky's other works, especially 'Nostalghia' and 'The Mirror'; Tarkovsky was also an admirer of the films of Carl Theodor Dreyer, and the latter's films are some of the very few that, for mine, equal Tarkovsky's achievement.*The Criterion DVD has excellent picture quality and sound - better than the prints I've seen in theatres. If you have a widescreen TV the format can be optimised by setting for 'zoom' and adjusting the vertical pitch of the image until the black bar on the top of the screen disappears - the subtitles will then be fully visible below the frame. (Actually, I'd suggest trying to view the film with the subtitles turned off - particularly on a third or fourth viewing - for me, the visuals become all the more overwhelming.)",N/A

130309,"I viewed this film for the second time tonight, and will admit that I did not enjoy it as much as I did the first time.  There are more than a few flaws in the screenwriting and possibly even directing that comes short of making the film complete and satisfying.  However, I felt the message was somewhat provoking and atleast well-intentioned.Most people who hated this movie seem to think that this film was very &quot;anti-military.&quot;  Being that I'm not in the military myself (a few of my friends are), my attention was not focused on how sensitively the film dealt with the topic.  I notice now after the second showing that a few lines here and there seemed to hint towards anti-military sentiments.  However, whether it be the military, the government, the Church, the education system, we cannot deny that corruption is possible in any standing institution.Gang-rape out of jealousy?  A general who covers up the crime in efforts to save the face of West Point?  Perhaps they shouldn't have used so directly the name of West Point and instead, referred to it as some general academy.  I don't think gang-rape out of jealousy is impossible and farfetched.  Rape is a crime of hate and sexism in the military setting is very present.  One of my bestfriends is in the third highest command here at Virginia Tech with the Corps Cadets and she is constantly competing with the other men, and constantly scrutinized in their presence.  Being a female in the military is NOT easy, and resentment between students, especially between sexes, is not all that unlikely.As for the general covering up the crime -- why is that unrealistic?  If the media jumped all over the rape case, what female would feel safe applying to an institution where they are potential victims?  No university, whether military or civilian wants to have their rapes publicized.  It is bad for the name of the university and bad for their business.  For the general to have chosen to keep quiet about the rape of his daughter was not the moral decision but an easy way out for this predicament.And what are the responses from the child who has just been denied justice by her own father?  While I can't say I condone the acts she committed in order to capture her father's attention, I can say that I understand the psychology of a rape victim.  Refusing to bring her perpetrators to justice, and denying that the rape even happened told the daughter that she not only all alone in her situation, but that she was worthless and insignificant in her father's eyes.  Having to return to school and constantly facing the fear of her &quot;faceless&quot; perpetrators must have also been traumatizing.  This experience alone is enough to carve a wound so deep into a person's soul that revenge seems to be the only path of fulfillment.A few major flaws in the film were the re-creation of the rape and who actually murdered her.  Timothy Hutton's character lacked depth and the screenwriting failed to develop a strong tie between the victim and perpetrator, leaving the audience to think, &quot;Wait a minute, who is this guy and WHY did he kill her?&quot;  Their story seemed insignificant to the entire picture.  As for the re-creation of the rape, why wasn't More there to watch if anything badly happened to her?  Was he just expecting that her own father would untie her?  What if he decided that he would not, and she was left all alone out there all night long?  Didn't she have a better back up plan than that?  Furthermore, I was appalled that none of the men who saw her out there tried to cover her body when immediately saw her (it just appears psychologically inaccurate).  I mean, isn't that a person's first instinct, to cover up someone's exposed body?  Another flaw is the fact that More was the last to find out about Elizabeth's murder.  If he had been the one to help her stage the scene, why wasn't he available for her the rest of the night incase she should want to be released from that humiliating position?  Some of this was just behaviorally inaccurate.James Cromwell reminded me of his Captain role in LA Confidential.  John Travolta, I personally thought, was good and entertaining (perhaps a little too gutsy, but hey, it's Hollywood).  Madeleine Stowe could have been used more, and definitely Hutton's character, as mentioned before, was underdeveloped (and too underdeveloped to be the killer, in my opinion).All in all, a pretty decent film about the psychological warfare that occurs between a parent and a child, and how it can explode and branch out into many evils just because the parent was cause for deficits in the child.",N/A

The action is mostly confined to a single house and involves conflict between just two characters, yet the tension is palpable.  Bates' character undergoes violent and frightening mood swings, which are expertly played.  Caan's air of quiet desperation is also well-done.  William Goldman's script also deserves mention: the characters behave intelligently, so it is enjoyable to watch the cat-and-mouse game that unfolds before us.",N/A

564154,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer's first season was a short one due to the fact it debuted in March of 1997 and the television season ends in May.  But despite the fact season one only consists of twelve episodes, they pack as much power as any debut season of any show on television.  Throughout the first season, we are introduced to all the major players in addition to Buffy including Xander, Willow, Giles and Angel.  Angel starts off as a minor character, but as the season progresses he and Buffy become more involved and his role elevates.  Season one continuing plot revolves around The Master who is the supreme vampire.  He is trapped in the Hellmouth and throughout the season chronicles his attempt to be freed.  Even though the main focus is on fighting vampires, other demons arise.  One particularly strong episode is where Xander and several other students are possessed with the spirits of hyenas.  They develop the attributes of hyenas including the pack mentality.  This episode really shows the brilliance of Joss Whedon as the hyenas are a metaphor for the clique and pack mentality of high school and how the strong packs pick on the weaker ones.  Buffy is a rare show that combines humor, drama, the supernatural into a show that can scare you, make you laugh and touch you all in one episode.",N/A
572742,"This made-for-cable movie is an honest attempt to boil down Jimi Hendrix's life and music down to less than two hours.  Unfortunately the producers were unable to obtain the rights to any of Jimi's songs, so the musical score is entirely made of up his covers (Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower, Wild Thing, etc.) plus some unattributed jamming.  You get the typical 60s montages (JFK, Malcom X, the Beatles, Dylan, etc.) along with the cookie-cutter dialogue and vastly oversimplified story.Despite some good performances, the script doesn't really offer the scope to examine why Hendrix's music was so revolutionary, or the problems that led to his early death.There's not much fire here, either, as the film suffers from wooden pacing and is never especially absorbing.The documentary film &quot;Jimi Hendrix&quot;, also available on DVD, is a far better way to gain an appreciation of this artist.",Hendrix
215932,"REVISED REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY ""Full Disclosure Edition"" on Blu-ray)""Apocalypse Now almost described what happened to Francis Ford Coppola himself with this film. Originally Copppola was just going to produce and George Lucas was going to direct but Coppola eventually found himself in the director's chair in the Phillipines and with millions of dollars of sets destroyed by bad weather. Coppola found himself on a journey to the heart of darkness as production continued endlessly, Coppola continued to rewrite and reshoot footage, Martin Sheen had a heart attack and Coppola had what can best be described as a nervous break down.This new deluxe Blu-ray edition has been prepared from a new high definition transfer that has been color corrected and is presented in the correct aspect ratio for the first time. The new transfer looks quite good for the original version of the film (my preferred version)and ""Redux"" Coppola's rethink of the original film (which has some worthwhile moments and is interesting as an alternate take of the original vision but can't possibly replace the original flawed masterpiece).This edition also includes Eleanor Coppola's documentation of the insanity that surrounded the making of this film; ""Heart of Darkness"" is a marvelous documentary and receives its first HD transfer. Keep in mind that it was originally shot in 16mm so while it doesn't quite have the sharper look of the original film (or ""Redux""), it has never looked better on home video.We get a huge amount of extras including the following new material--Francis Ford Coppola interviewing Martin Sheen (which is quite interesting given their shared experience and recollection of the insanity of the shoot); Coppola with screenwriter John Milius (Coppola recognizes Milius' important contribution to the script since HE wrote the original drafts that Coppola ended up working with as director); Orson Welles (who originally was going to direct a film version of ""Heart of Darkness"" for RKO before settling on ""Citizen Kane"")in a radio production of Joseph Conrad's novel; the entire interview of Coppola by Roger Ebert.Carried over from the previous edition are Coppola's audio commentary as well as both versions of the film (that way you can watch which version you want--although be advised this has the ORIGINAL 70mm theatrical ending which fades out WITHOUT the footage of the destruction of Kurtz's compound--that was added later to the 35mm print when it went into wide release although that footage IS included as with the previous edition as an extra). The bulk of the original special features are carried over to this edition as well. Due to time constraints I haven't had time to dig into all the other extras that were carried over from the previous edition although it appears on the surface to be exactly the same as the previous edition from Paramount Home Video.""Hearts of Darkness"" includes a commentary track by Coppola and his wife Eleanor and on that same disc we also get excerpts from Millius'original script with Coppola's notes, storyboard gallery as well as marketing archive. I haven't had a chance to do more than peak at ""Hearts of Darkness"" (although I did have the previous edition which also had the commentary track on DVD)and haven't had a chance to really look at the extras on this disc so I can't provide any info on them beyond citing that they are here.We also get a lovely 48 page soft cover book with behind-the-scenes photos, an excerpt of the guide given to the production personnel on their arrival on location pointing out restaurants, etc. and a copy of the pages from Coppola's edition of Joseph Conrad's novel that Coppola kept with him for inspiration and notes.""Apocalpyse Now"" would be Coppola's truly last great film (although he would make some exceptional ones in its wake)and proved to almost be his own personal apocalpyse where the director began to question the wisdom of making the film in the first place. While it isn't a flawless classic (what is?), even it's flaws in the original version are made up for by the ambition and vision Coppola delivers. In the case of ""Redux"" it's an interesting variation on the original but can't quite compete and comes across almost as an after thought--an interesting one--but one that doesn't quite pay off as well as the original film did in 1979 and even today.",N/A

I particularly liked the fight scene in the restaurant and the chase in the streets. Anita Mui, who plays his lover, is not as funny as in movies like Drunken Master II, but is still adding a nice touch to the comedic aspect of the film.Unfortunately, the quality for the picture and the sound of the DVD isn't what we're accustomed from Columbia/Tri-Star. A few scratches from time to time destroy a little bit our pleasure. And I can't believe that this edition is offered in mono only. It should at least have been in dolby surround.A strange thing is that the subtitled version on the disc is 127 mins. long, but the dubbed one on the other side of the disc is 106 mins. long.

195489,"I have watched a fair share of anime series in my time and I can honestly say Pet shop is definetly one of the most unique, interesting and fascinating ever. Not only are the stories creepy and full of nice little mean twists and wonderfully screwed up characters it's impossible not to love, but aside from LAIN this is the best dub work I have ever heard in an anime series.CONTENT: Even though all the stories are based on the same premise (&quot;don't brake these 3 rules or your pet will kill you&quot;) the stories all have different morales and ideas behind them making each show different from the last. DAUGHTER is about how too much love is not a good thing. DESIRE is about not confusing guilt with true love. DESPAIR is about living a short but happy life and be remembered for the good things. DUAL is about sacrificing everything for someone else and thus gaining one's own happiness. I like them all, and I LOVE the first one.DVD: has great features. True, the dleted material is really just a weird video opening that I thank God they didn't use on the show, but there are also a number of interesting trailers, and best of all a commentary with the director and the voice actors for Count D and Leon the cop.

371179,"Cecil B. DeMille approached Claudette Colbert for playing the title role in this fantasia/extravaganza on the life of Queen of the Nile. Obviously, the eccentric, egotistical DeMille took his pictures too seriously & they almost always have ""camp quality"" to them - which, incidentally, make them a lot of fun to watch! The pretentious dialogue is nigh hilarious at times (audiences laughed in 1934 as well!) Like most of DeMille""s biggest pictures, CLEOPATRA didn't exactly please the pious critics, but the public ate it up! The picture going public marveled at it's lavish 'kitsch' quality and savoured it's expensive excesses (i.e. when Cleo seduces Marc Antony, there are writhing and dancing females everywhere clad in seaweed; one is whipped into naked submission by a giant slave!) Colbert's versatility is astonishing in all actuality. In the year this was filmed (1934), she had played the role of Bea in the ultrasentimental IMITATION OF LIFE and won herself an AA for falling in love with Gable in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. These are three very different roles and Colbert did each of them magnificently. Colbert never takes her interpretation of Cleo TOO seriously and she cleverly delivers her lines with tongue-in-cheek flair. Travis Banton created the lavishly daring costumes and although this flick is not exactly a history teachers' ideal, at least it didn't bore everyone to tears like the 1963 Liz Taylor epic.",Cleopatra VHS
523381,"This is, without doubt, one of the worst films I've seen in a loooooooooooong time.  A sad reminder that even the best directors can have an off-day - and another, and another, and ...The action opens with a battle scene, filmed in the woods near Farnham in Surrey, England, which is so wrapped in gloom and haze that it tells us precisely nothing other than that the Romans had a more advanced armoury than their Germanic foe.Anyway, lots of noise and fire - looks like a good old-fashioned epic, right?Wrong!To cut a long story short, there's a really hunky good guy - whose main problem is that he can't speak clearly, so most of the time we don't know what on earth he's talking about.  But I suspect this doesn't really matter, because even when he does stop mumbling he never says much of any interest anyway.Then there's a bad guy, and he's a patricidal creep of the first water who, amongst other things, has the good guy's family killed - so you can't wait for him to get what's coming to him.  Only you do have to wait - for ages, and ages.Oh yes, there's also a heroine - but this is a real &quot;mano a mano&quot;-type film, so she never gets to be anything more than incidental set dressing.Now, you're never going to guess how it all turns out.The good guy kills the bad guy.  But the good guy dies as well, so he can rejoin his family in the great bye and bye.  Then the film ends.Bet that surprised you, didn't it!Actually there is one highlight in the film - Oliver Reed, proving what a very talented actor he was when in the right mood.Even so, that Ridley Scott felt it worthwhile to drag this pretentious drivel out to nearly two and a half hours simply beggars belief.Tip 1: Always be wary of a film where the scriptwriter is also one of the producers.Tip 2: If this film is so great, how come people are queueing up to sell their copy?",Gladiator VHS

No cinematic work is perfect, but &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; comes pretty darned close.Jack Nicholson is in his defining role as &quot;Jack McMurphy&quot;; his persona is not only ideal for the part, but his acting is absolutely splendid. Nicholson is supported by a wonderful cast that includes the painfully unforgettable performance of Louise Fletcher as &quot;Nurse Ratched.&quot; Several then unknown actors -- Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito among them -- round out the troupe beautifully. The redoubtable director Milos Forman guides his band of exceptional actors through an excellent screenplay and into cinematic immortality.While this DVD's picture quality leaves much to be desired, it's somehow fitting for this film. Strangely, the documentary-like quality of the movie make the prevalent grain and foreign matter appear as though they belong! This is the only film I've yet seen that doesn't seem to lose much for want of a good print. Still, objectively speaking, Warner showed no respect to this classic by allowing such a poor copy on DVD -- and providing a mediocre transfer to boot. (No surprise, they did a TERRIBLE job with &quot;The Stanley Kubrick Collection&quot;; so bad that they're redoing it.) Recorded sound is merely acceptable. The &quot;special features&quot; may once have been something, but they aren't any longer. DVD collectors expect more nowadays, not just a few pages of text.  In the end, however, this item remains a &quot;buy&quot;; it's relatively cheap, and it's the only available DVD version of this great movie.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
293793,"First of all, concerning the DVD edition of THE STRANGER -- the version I own and am reviewing is the Hollywood Classics release.  This is the one that comes with the 30-minute documentary on Orson Welles and the (rather frightening) introduction by Tony Curtis.  The picture and sound looked quite adequate to me though there is an annoying &quot;Delta&quot; logo that appears occasionally in the bottom right-hand corner.  I had never seen the film before and purchased this DVD in a 3-pack of Orson Welles films.  For the low price, the value is excellent and the video quality is quite good, though I'm sure it isn't as clear as the more expensive version.  The customer will have to decide if they want to pay three times the price to get a cleaner version or get a serviceable copy for the lower cost.Now moving on to the film.  This movie is much more straightforward than the other Orson Welles films that I've seen.  We have a standard good guy and a standard bad guy, and each character is set up in his role almost immediately.  Edward G. Robinson plays the Nazi-hunter who has been tracking Orson Welles' character since the end of the Second World War.  Welles' plays a Nazi who has gone into hiding and is now living in small town America as a schoolteacher.  The acting from the two leads is spellbinding -- as good as any of their best work, with Welles in particular stealing the show.  Welles triumphs in the difficult task of playing a man who has successfully integrated himself in a community, yet allowing the audience to see him as the villain that he is.  The viewer never questions why the outlaw has been able to fool his friends and neighbors for months but can also pick up on the same clues that Robinson's character does.The story is not overly complicated and this allows us to pay a lot of attention to the different characters in the movie.  The townspeople, without exception, are all given their own motivations without slipping into repetition and the silly catchphrases that movies set in small towns tend to give to their characters.  There are also some excellent shots that could only have come from Welles' keen directorial eye.  The German's obsession with clocks is an interesting metaphor for the Nazi mindset, but this is kept to a minimum and never becomes overbearing.I highly recommend this interesting film for anyone who enjoys good acting and intriguing storylines.  The documentary included on the DVD is very superficial and most of the 30 minutes are taken up by trailers of films, some of which barely feature Orson Welles himself.  It's not something that the Welles fan is going to get too much out of and it does not contain enough information for the casual viewer.  The introduction by Tony Curtis is frighteningly odd.",N/A

58945,"This is the funniest, and most original comedy of the 90's. Bruce Campbell has an amazing talent for cartoon-like facial expressions and this movie puts him in the same class as Jim Carrey and Jonathan Winters. This is pure escapism from start to finish with lots of wonderfully cornball one-liners, &quot;That was just pillow talk baby&quot;. Although some women like this flick, it's safe to call this a guy movie, but what a guy movie! What's most impressive about the film is the refreshingly original style that Sam Raimi brings to the screen. What a thrill it must have been to work with talent like Campbell who should have become a mega-star after this came out. What a shame it flopped. Jim Carrey is also a great talent but this movie blows Pet Detective away without a doubt. If you like the flying creature that picks up the girl and flies away with her, it may interest you to know you can see it in person next time you visit Las Vegas. It's hanging in the doorway as you enter Planet Hollywood at Caesar's Palace. Bruce Campbell would be the perfect choice to star in a Superman parody if they ever made one. Watch this film and you'll see what I mean. There are times you get the feeling you are watching Clark Kent's long lost half-wit twin. (Hollywood Producers or Sam Raimi if you are reading this, please take note!) In the meantime, if you are looking for the ultimate drinking movie for the next time you get together with your buddies, look no further. The director's cut is awful however so beware. In that version they cut out half of the best one-liners and replaced the ending with something stupid. The real version contains a brilliantly funny ending in which a witch travels through time to a Sporting Goods Store. Classic! This movie will appeal to those who don't like horror movies (like myself). It's not a horror movie. And remember...clatau, nectu, cough! cough! Bow to the king baby!",N/A

450419,"Gwyneth Paltrow's best film to date, performance-wise, even better (I think) then 'Shakespeare in Love'. She plays Helen, and... Helen. Should be confusing, but surprisingly, isn't. The movie really picks up when Helen, who's just been fired from her major PR job in downtown London, misses a train. And then, rewind, she catches the train. What insues is a delightful, unique, and surpisingly deep film about what her life is like traveling down the two different paths. On one hand, she has lazy, scummy boyfriend Jerry, who you somehow can't help liking at least a little bit (at least, you never hate him as much as you'd like to). He's a great comic presence, confused and trying to do the right thing, but keeps tripping over his own self-indulgent feet. On the other hand, you have John Hannah's character, and good-hearted and hilarious bloke who's original and quite cute. The way Helen reacts with others in a scene is wonderful. Definitely worth watching over and over.",N/A
208839,"Well, this was never really my favorite movie. But the quality of much recent media has increased my opinion of &quot;Popeye&quot; quite a bit. Most people can not seem to make a movie these days without giving us all effects and no story, showering us with blood, sex, or profanity, trying to force feed us what is politically correct, or having someone killed every other minute. The fact that &quot;Popeye&quot; does not fall into any of these categories greatly increases my opinion of it. Now it is not the most worthy movie to be sure. HOWEVER, there are many memorable elements. The scenery is simple, but it does carry charm. The songs are cute and memorable. The town's fear of Popeye, and later its acceptance of him is realistic and well done. It is touching how Popeye fights through a difficult journey to find his father, and funny when he gets into different kinds of trouble on the way, and accidentally becomes the town's hero. (When he accidentally pushes the tax man into the water.) Popeye's father is handled well. First we hear of him. (Although we don't know the person everyone is talking about is Popeye's father.) Then we see him, and the resemblance to Popeye makes it obvious that he is Popeye's father; then they meet and discover each other. Popeye's final persuit of Bluto is suspenseful and hilarious. We finally see Popeye and his father together and they get on each other's nerves the whole way. Popeye's father even carries out his role as a father when he pushes Popeye into doing something so he can save the day! So while this is not exactly a smash hit, (in my opinion) it carries many worthy elements; it is worth the time; and while it may not become a classic, it will probably carry a strong cult following. If you have not seen it, do so. You may be pleasantly surprised.",Popeye
147906,"Fargo is a movie that I put off watching for 5 years for really no reason at all besides laziness or there were always &quot;better&quot; movies to rent.  Well, it's too bad I actually took the time to watch this so-called great movie.  The word that comes to mind is pointless and ridiculous.  That's 2 words, but oh well.  And the thing that I cannot believe is that this movie won awards.  Yeah, the acting is pretty darn good.  The accents are awesome.  To know that people actually speak that way is hysterical.  But, the movie really has no point.  There was a lot of pointless dialogue that added nothing to the movie besides getting to hear people say &quot;ya.&quot;  At times I didn't know whether to laugh or be shocked.  Normally if someone is shot in the face it's not very funny, but this movie seems to make it.  The humor is what kept me watching, but still, this is not a great movie by any lengths.  Overall, Fargo is an over hyped movie that fails to deliver anything besides a few laughs at some accents.  Not very exciting.  2 Stars",N/A

The movie's first half, set in 1930s Spain, is rather heart warming about a young boy and his elderly teacher.  The teacher singles the boy out for special kindness and tutoring, including giving the boy a butterfly net and their using the net to explore and understand the natural world. The teacher explains to the boy all the characteristics of a certain insect before setting it free again.  However, the Spanish Civil War creeps into the movie's second half and it divides its citizens so that they start turning on one another and urging one another's arrest to avoid the same themselves.  The story continues to follow the boy and the teacher through this growing ugliness until they themselves are enmeshed in the same conflict of citizen persecuting fellow citizen that every Civil War entails.

482335,"Scream gave us the motives and the major storyline, Scream 2 lengthened the storyline, and Scream 3 settled the motives and the storyline. That's how the trilogy went, and it was a fun ride.And in the third and final Scream, we see that Sidney is in hiding in the California hills and is ultimately paranoid. But who can blame her? She's only had 4 psychos kill almost 15 of her friends or people close to her. Meanwhile, Stab 3 is currently in production, with a now successful Cotton making a cameo in the movie and Dewey being a technical advisor on the movie. Suddenly, bodies began to turn up, and the killer leaves pictures of a young Sidney's mother with every victim. Now Sidney, Dewey, and Gale (who thinks she's hot on the case) and the remaining cast and crew of Stab 3 must try to survive, and Sidney must try to discover who the killer is, and why the pictures of her mother are turning up.With another all star cast, and great writing, Scream 3 ended the Scream trilogy in a way that combined all three Screams with a very surprising plot twist. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox-Arquette give their characters their usual moods and tones, and do it well. I personally love Courtney's character, Gale Weathers. New additions in Scream 3 are Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Lance Henricksen, Jenny McCarthy, and many more talented actors. Parker Posey was certainly there for comedic relief. She was hilarious. There are also some surprise cameos. Ehren Kruger took over as writer, and did very well. As Scream movies do, they poke fun at the horror genre. Specifically a scene with Jenny McCarthy's character in which she complains about being having to die naked in Stab 3. And as with Scream and Scream 2, the horror-meister Wes Craven was in the director's chair. Wes' directing style is perfect for horror movies, and is very respectable to the genre.I love the Scream Trilogy, but I would NOT want another Scream. It ended the way it was supposed to, and if there is another, it would totally ruin the whole thing.As for the DVD, I thank Dimension Home Video for it. The video and audio transfers are great. We are TREATED with an assortment of deleted scenes or alternate takes, including an alternate ending. Although there really isn't much difference, it was still fun to watch. The commentary given by Wes and some of the crew is very interesting and they never quit talking, which is a good thing in this commentary's case because they always have something interesting to say.

264869,"Hideous Sun Demon, Robert Clarke's auteurist tour-de-force, aims for high drama but achieves drive-in monsterama cool instead. Apparently conceived as a sensitive portrayal of the inner torment of a man possessed by a strange condition beyond his control, they just didn't have the budget to bring it off. Besides, it's hard to work up sympathy for a character who, after being told by his doctor to stay home and not drink any alcohol, immediately heads out to the bar. Then there's the bosomy b-girl who's just had her boyfriend and his thugs work over our hero, who turns around and starts consoling him and takes him home. But the illogic's half the fun of this movie, and anyhow, we're really here for the cool Blaisdell-esque rubber Sun Demon, the rat-squishing, and Clarke's over-the-top performance. For cheese lovers there's plenty of bad acting and that let's-talk-about-it-cause-we-can't-afford-to-show-it thing going on. Giving credit where it's due, however, several locations are exploited for some interesting visuals. Basically, another fun hour-and-ten for the bad cinema set.Image's DVD presents the movie in the best edition I've seen yet. The source print is not flawless; there are a half dozen or so short (15 sec) stretches of distracting horizontal scratching, some intermittent light vertical scratching, and the usual very light to light speckling and spotting throughout. But overall it  looks quite good; sharp and detailed, with generally excellent tonal values. Other than the horizontal scratches, it blows the socks off my Starlog Video VHS copy, and if you're used to catching this on the late night monster shows you'll probably be quite pleased.

It added such a zest for life, and such a reality to it that the Brady Bunch never had! You connected with each child, and even I knew their names before the movie ended. Lucille Ball is superb in this role. I have rarely seen her play too much of the mother role, for I Love Lucy had Little Ricky, but he was just a side character. She beautifully portrayed the typical single Mom. Henry Fonda gave a stunning performance, which made you simple love him. You felt for him, and for his kids. One of the best scenes in the movie, is where all of his boys, when making a drink for Lucille Ball's character, unknowningly add liquor to her supposed screw driver. By unknowingly, I mean that they didn't know the others had also added something.

544142,"The hard truth is that it's been tough to be a John Carpenter fan for the past decade or so.Sure we remember that this the guy who gave us such classics as ""Assault on Precinct 13,""  ""Halloween,"" ""Escape From New York,"" and ""The Thing.""  Even his box office disappointments(""Big Trouble In Little China"", ""They Live"") were still better and more interesting than just about anything else to hit multiplex screens during his glory years of the mid-seventies through eighties.But by the early 1990s, Carpenter hit a slump that saw him cranking out one schlock film after another.  Think of  ""In the Mouth of Madness"" or ""Vampires.""For this reason, I was more than a little skeptical when ""Ghosts of Mars"" hit theaters last summer.  Even aside from J.C.'s recent track record, the film seemed a pastiche of other pop culture sources like ""Pitch Black,"" Ray Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles, and even Carpenter's own ""Precinct 13.""  But my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a chance.My verdict?  Forget all the negative hype about this film.  It's the movie Carpenter fans have been waiting for.Granted the film isn't the least bit scary.  It also doesn't ponder any weighty philosophical or political questions, like some of Carpenter's earlier films.  What it does offer however is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi action pic that delivers plenty of ass-kickin' action with Carpenter's trademark cynicism thrown in to boot.I won't rehash the plot, since odds are you've already read the summary above.  Instead, I'll focus on some other things I liked about this film, like the cast.  I'll believe Ice Cube is a great actor when I see him convincingly play a brain surgeon, a priest, or something other than another variation of the same scowling bad ass he played in his debut film, ""Boyz In the Hood"" years ago.  Still when a scowling badass is what you want, this rapper is your man and his persona(he basically plays himself in every movie) serves him well here.As for Natasha Henstridge, no matter what she does she'll probably always be thought of as ""The babe from the `Species' movies.""  But the script smartly plays off her ""hottie"" status, by having her cop deftly fend off sexual advances from both her female commanding officer(Pam Grier) and her fellow officer(Jason Statham).  She's smart as a whip and tough as nails.The supporting cast, is also full of interesting picks, Statham and Clea Duvall are two of my favorite character actors and 70s-film goddess Grier is always fun to watch though I wish she had more to do here.Also worth noting is the action.  It's been years, since Carpenter did a balls-out action film, and it looks like this script really got his juices flowing.  The action scenes here just flat out rock.Lastly, though the film's overall storyline is nothing special or inventive it's biggest asset is that it does succeed in drawing the viewer in.  After watching this movie, I found myself wanting to know more about these characters, about the true nature of the film's ""Martians,"" and about the matriarchal human society that came to rule the red planet.Though the film's dissappointing performance at the box offices puts the prospects of a sequel in doubt, I have to say it would be more than a little interesting to revisit the characters and story elements introduced here.I only saw the film in the theatre so I cannot comment on the DVD release.  However, the extras listed here pretty much guarantees that I will buy it at some point in the near future although I have only one quibble:  Why no Ice Cube commentary?Bottom line though, this movie is really a must for JC fans and anyone who likes the sci-fi action genre. John Carpenter is back and back in fine form.",N/A

She is beautiful, talented, unconventional and luminous in this role of a wandering woman and her daughter who open a chocolate shop in a small, conservative French town just as Lent begins. Binoche slowly wins over the townspeople with her delicious concoctions, but the mayor (Alfred Molina) is unmoved, as is a severe women who works with him (Carrie Anne Moss, virtually unrecognisable from her role as Trinity in The Matrix). Binoche's daughter is charmingly portrayed by young actress Victoire Thivisol, who was first seen as a tiny child in the engaging and sad French film Ponette. Binoche's love interest is played by Johnny Depp, who is summarily shunned by the town. Other fascinating roles, the always superb Judi Dench as the woman who rents the shop to Binoche (and as Moss's estranged mother. Moss will not allow Dench to see her grandson, but Binoche conspires to allow grandmother and grandson to see one another secretly at her shop). Also important here are the roles of the abused wife, Lena Olin (real-life wife of director Lasse Hallstrom) and her husband, played well by Peter Stormare (whom you may remember best as the accomplice to the crime in Fargo.

There are enough melee scenes for any pubescent lad to get his testosterone blazing. Plenty of choreographed fight scenes &amp; clever effects. Stop action animation is better than we saw in 50's B movies. But, an important point was overlooked--everything in the movie is new. Clothes are clean, just off the costumers' sewing machines.Let's not forget the villain, Profien. Not at all convincing, more of a geek. Banal, not convincingly evil.

569960,"I used to go to the theater frequently and one playwright I came to adore was Alan Ayckbourn from the UK. He was to comedic plays what playwrights David Mamet and Sam Shepherd were to dramatic ones. Ayckbourn's gift is to hit dead on the essential underpinnings of the British middle and upper classes and set them up for laughter amidst a rollicking good story line.  I was absolutely astounded to discover how good Helena Bonham-Carter is doing comedic material.  When I first put the disk on the player, hubby saw she was in it and groaned, being convinced she plays nothing other than sullen witches.  He was even more astounded than I was by the utterly transformed Bonham-Carter. The basic premise of the comedy is simple.  Bonham-Carter will get revenge on Neill's competitor who stole his job.  In exchange, Neill will wreck revenge upon the wife of Bonham-Carter's former lover.  This leads to one hilarious scene after another with the high point being a duel in the woods, with shotguns, between Neill and the former lover.  Only Ayckbourn could come up with 2 Brits using shotguns instead of dueling pistols in the name of honor and make it gently humorous instead of outright Monty Python zaney. If you have never seen an Ayckbourn play or film before, you are in for a treat.  Ayckbourn becomes an acquired taste along the way that no other playwright fills quite as well in his little niche British world.",Sweet Revenge

THE movie for anyone who is a film maker, movie buff, or anyone who is just simply a humanitarian.&quot;american movie&quot; is without any doubt a unique and positively brilliant cinematic masterpiece.  the film gives an inside look at not only the process of making an independent movie, but also ,and more importantly, an inside look at the person inside all of us.you care about the people in this film not because they're just cardboard characters, but because they are REAL people. this is truly a very moving and touching, at times even heartwarming, film.i can't really say anything more about this film than i have because its one of those rare movies that you just have to experience for yourself to understand what makes it so special.no offense, but if you're a shallow person, this is not the movie for you, you'd be better off watching &quot;show girls&quot; for the thousandth time.while this is a movie about film making, it is more of a movie about humanity and comradery. this film is anything but superficial, and is one of those rare films that has a true heart beating inside of it.watch it, and enjoy.",N/A

It makes you stop and think about what you do, why you do it, you just think about everything. I do agree that the Green Mile is horrible, and no even comparable to this. I enjoyed Morgan Freeman's nice, pleasurable tone on the narration and I think Tim Robbins plays his part masterfully. It is very well directed and, even though it goes at a very mellow and slow rate, you never get bored. The characters are so interesting that you have to know what happens to them. There are lots of twists and turning points in the story, and the last half hour of this film is the most enjoyable half-hour you'll ever see. Go and rent this movie.

536076,"I went to see this movie with my family and my cousin, and I was utterly surprised, when the movie was over, that everyone in our party loved it!I, personally, totally enjoyed it. I agree that The Silence of the Lambs had much more plot and flowed more smoothly than Hannibal, but you have to admit that this is kind of a fun movie (yes! fun!). There was only one flaw that I thought took away from the movie: Irrelevency. There wasn't anything in it that was completely irrelevent, but the writers came pretty close. When I say it was &quot;irrelevent&quot;, I'm not saying it to convey the thought of the movie being just a time-filler. No. what I mean is that there were a couple of things that happened toward the beginning of the movie that were never brought up again. One: What happened to Barney? Did they get him for selling the goods?The movie's actors were something to brag on! Anthony Hopkins was, as usual, amazing. He played Dr. Lecter/Dr. Fell to a T. He made his character almost &quot;loveable&quot;, which is good and bad at the same time. Good: it makes the movie more fun and suspensful to watch. I don't like watching movies where I HATE the main character. Bad: you find yourself feeling guilty for actually LIKING this evil thing that has no mercy for anyone, except Clarice. Julianne Moore was also VERY GOOD. Only one thing took away from her performance and made me want Jodie Foster back: the accent. In SotL, Foster kept her strong accent throughout the entire movie. In Hannibal, Moore, had it a little sometimes and none at other times. Maybe she shed it, finally...I don't know. You have to admit, though, Moore is one brave lady for attempting to fill Foster's shoes, and she does a great job of it!I didn't find the violence and gore in this movie unbearable. I can think of many movies, along with Made-For-TV-Movies that had more violence and murder than this one. Saving Private Ryan comes to mind first.One last note to those of you who were disgusted at Lecter's affection to Starling and Starling's respect to Lecter...don't read the book. You'll burn it after reading the ending! I loved it, but, then again, I found the bond between the two in the movie impressive.All in all, this movie is one to see.

227301,"This film is a German-French coproduction, so it is interesting as a product of how Americans are viewed by the Europeans.  Every scene seems to contain images of something that is decaying or something that is being built.  Cars are everywhere.  Expansive desert vistas mirror the barrenness of the main character's inner life.  Motion is seen as an antidote to pain.  The final confrontation between Harry Dean Stanton and Nastasia Kinski is very moving, and the plight of Stanton's character at the end of the film is heartbreaking.",N/A
466497,"I haven't as yet seen this DVD (I fully plan to as Jackie Chan dubbed on this release I am told).  The 3 stars are for the movie itself.  It is not the best Jackie Chan Hong Kong movie, the Police Story series and Project A 1 &amp; 2 are much better but is definitely worth a look.  I have seen an old dubbed version (OK) and the Asian DVD release (better).  Before approaching any &quot;old&quot; Jackie Chan film (ie. ones done in Hong Kong before America!) viewers should be aware they are lower budgeted so don't have the capacity for special effects as in US movies.  Also, what a Chinese considers funny might not necessarily be what a westerner thinks is funny!  Keeping this in mind, I really liked this film.  The story is &quot;old&quot; (ie. twins separated at birth and coming together later in life with the expected mix-ups) but with Jackie (twice!) it is a lot of fun.  The last action scene in the car factory shows Jackie's amazing acrobatic and martial arts skills to perfection.  If you are Hong Kong movie buff, there are a lot of cameo appearances by HK actors and directors.  Jackie did not direct this film, so ignore any criticism of bad direction by him!  Most of the films Jackie directed himself are superb action pieces, though the acting is not very good in some.  Jackie is more interested in action than dialogue, though &quot;Accidental Spy&quot;, his latest Asian release, is extremely good in all aspects, both action and action, with a good storyline.

It is like all the people who are obsessed with it are exactly alike. Like there is something at the core of this movie that we all want in our lives, and it speaks to us in many ways.

Except for Fearless Hyena 1, which Jackie directed, he loathed them.  He was under contract to Lo Wei and only broke away when he signed with Golden Harvest and made the breakthrough martial arts film, Young Master.  The Lo Wei films in this collection are very badly done (except for Fearless Hyena and perhaps Half a Loaf of Kung Fu, which was an attempt by Jackie to &quot;break away&quot; from the martial arts mould).

541877,"This film spawned yet another &quot;movie moniker&quot; for me: &quot;Schizophrenic Deja-Vu.&quot;  I can't think of a better description.This is truly an enterprising way to choreograph a film - from the end, BACKWARDS to the beginning!The disjointed way in which it is filmed gives you a pretty good feeling for what Leonard actually experiences as his life.LOTS of plausible motives and suspects are developed throughout the film, so by the end (er, beginning) you STILL can't be sure you have it figured out - and chances are you won't anyway.  It's not exactly a suprise ending, but it wasn't expected either.  Or it was expected along with any of a half dozen OTHER possible endings.You know those &quot;experimental&quot; films where audiences are given a chance to VOTE on where the plot goes, as it actually plays out?  Well, this would be one heck of a good candidate.  The movie could have gone in any of a dozen other directions and been as unique and compelling as ever.The only down side to this was that of all the possible endings I was imagining, the actual ending was rather abrupt and sort of &quot;unfullfilling.&quot;  It was as if the director and screenwriter, having gotten this huge machine rolling downhill, couldn't think of a way to STOP it, so they just let it plow into the brick wall at the bottom.  Perhaps not too bad a solution, though.  Given the complexity of the screenplay, I can't imagine coming up with &quot;the one true ending&quot; that really settled it all.Definately a riveter though.",Memento VHS

Although it is not as slick as most Hollywood productions and many later Asian action flicks, it generates more energy than any film that I have seen for a long time.  That energy does not come from fast cuts, loud music, or any the other standard tricks of the film trade.  It comes from the fast and furious movements of highly trained human bodies.  The actors are the best martial artists that China had to offer at the time and it shows.  This is the real thing.",Shaolin Temple (World Video)

Now that i have the New Line Platnium Edition I can see inside the directors mind and how he made S7ven, what thoughts he had about the characters, the scenes and the story, how he set up the mood. This is all explained in the four commentaries that are included with the disc. On the second disc are supplemental material such as an inside look to the making of John Does books and the making of the title sequence with alternate versions. Also included are Deleted scenes with optional commentary, (mostly just extended takes but still good otherwise). But of course the best thing about it is the movie itself, fully remastered to look and sound just like the director wanted it. This is a must have for everybody.",Seven

It seemed to have the sense of coming from secondhand experience, not from someone who had &quot;been there..&quot;  I found the film life affirming and a gussied up version of what the struggles of addiction and recovery are about, and therefore worthwhile.

207948,The Enterprise Incident in my opinion is one of the top 5 episodes in the original series.  I always like it when the Romulans or Klingons appear in the Star Trek Series be it The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine or Voyager.  But the original series really gets it right when it came to the Romulans (not only this epiode but in the episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;). This episode begins with the Enterprise crossing the Neutral Zone which is like the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the USA and USSR.What the Enterprise is doing in Romulan Territory is anyone's guess until the last 20 minutes or so.  Several twists in the plot occur and it is suspensful from the beginning to the end.The Romulan Commander is played by the beautiful Joanne Linville and she gives an unforgettable performance.Highly recommended to all Star Trek fans!,"Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 59: The Enterprise Incident VHS"
520991,"Well, when I first said I wanted to see this movie my mom looked it up on Deseret News, and it was a bad review. So from that point on my mom was not for it! When I finally did get to see it I was entertained, and not to mention I could see it again in the same day without getting bored! which means it wasn't a film you could memorize when you see it for the first time. You don't know what's going to happen next, and you can never tell either.  If you've read even a little about the story you'd know that the droid goes mustang, and is after them.  What impressed me was the robot...it looked exactly like a mountain lion, or a puma.  It moved like one, and it even acted like one!  So when that robot goes BAZERK it gave me chills, because I've had mountain lions in my back yard before. Another thing was the plot, it was not what you usually expect from  a Mars film.  Usually you'd find aliens on Mars, either they what to totally exterminate the entire human race, or they are some sort of god-like figure, BUT NOT IN THIS MOVIE!!

For us Hamlet fans, it is painful to see the work crushed into the constraint of a two hour (or less) movie.

397266,"It's too long, too unfocused and way too self-indulgent. But in the end, none of this matters. Sean Penn's second effort as a director-screenwriter is compelling and emotionally resonant ways that more conventionally well-made films never manage to be. Jack Nicholson gives one of his finest performances as Freddy Gale, a jewelry store owner whose  daughter was killed by a drunken driver six years before the story begins. Since then, the devastated Freddy has remained alive only by nursing the hope that he will be able to kill John Booth (David Morse), the man who accidentally killed his daughter. But as the guilt-racked Booth is released from prison, it becomes very clear that perhaps neither man really wants to live much longer. Throughout &quot;Crossing Guard,&quot; Penn has a tendency to sledgehammer his way through walls rather than simply opening doors. Even so, he always gets where he wants to go -- to that dark corner of our hearts where we can forgive no one, not even ourselves. Co-star Anjelica Huston has a couple of terrific scenes as Freddy's ex-wife, a woman with her own share of guilt, fear and loathing.",Crossing Guard VHS

Also, this is the only place to find the MTV-style music videos for &quot;Your Wildest Dreams,&quot; &quot;I Know You're Out There Somewhere,&quot; &quot;No More Lies,&quot; and the 1989-remake of &quot;Question.&quot;  This is the closest that the band will come, I believe, to releasing a music video anthology as well as a documentary.

Much to my delight, the DVD is not the cesspool of quality others have rated it at; it's a good collection of classic Popeye, plain and simple.The quality could be worlds better here and there -- and the original makers of these cartoons could have kept them stored in climate-controlled, air-tight vaults. The thing to remember is a lot of these shorts were made for the simple reason of economics; they were made to make money, not for prosperity. Care of the original film wasn't a priority after it was made.Regardless, this collection is great. It's fun to watch, I'm seeing cartoons I haven't seen in years, and my son loves them.

She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised.  She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder.  She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder).  We love her.Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)...  How about...no, no, NO.  Give her someone near her equal.  How about a real actor twice her age?  How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))?  Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance.  Not only does it work, it's a triumph.  Finney really is brilliant.  His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character.  Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses?  For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion).  For the first time in her life she is doing something important.  For the first time in her life people respect her.  There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth.  She neglects him and her kids for her obsession.  Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife.  Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her.  It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts!  She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real.  That's her gift.A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath (&quot;and all his relatives,&quot; as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the &quot;little guy&quot; versus the corporate behemoth.  I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending.  But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim.  I haven't seen any of his latest movies,  (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, &amp; Videotape from 1989.  I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000.",Erin Brockovich VHS
2413,"A recent review of James Clavell's 1971 film, &quot;The Last Valley&quot; missed the point completely.  Clavell's choice of Europe in the midst of one of the worst calamities to befall Western Civilization was done because this time and place, along with the Thirty Years War, was the crucible from which the modern world emerged...the modern territorial state, sovereignty, secularism, humanism, etc.  You do not have to look very hard to find references to these issues in the film.  But beyond that, there are universal isssues here.  True, there is a reaction to the war in Vietnam, America's worst foreign policy calamity, as there are numerous reactions to other anxieties of that time, relgion, superstition, inhumanity and humanity, and, of course, war.  A national news magazine, at the time, ran the headline &quot; Is God Dead?&quot;  Richard M. Nixon was forming an &quot;enemies list.&quot;  Revelations of American atrocities in Southeast Asia were coming out.  Of course this was a troubled time.  Michael Caine and Omar Sharif portray composite chararacters...they are both cast in the role of &quot;everyman.&quot;  But each represents different but no less vital parts of humanity...the realist and the idealist...hope and the abandonment of hope.  You must see the film, and then ponder which holds out for mankind.  The film itself is well acted, especially by Caine (note the basis for his character in &quot;The Eagle Has Landed) and Sharif, and directed.  Clavell's script is profound at times.  It is beautifully, and dramtically, photographed.  And it is driven by a musical score that is one of John Barry's best achievements.  The transfer to DVD is not as good as one might have hoped for.  It is in the bargain category, afterall.  It remains visually stunning, and the sound has been preserved quite well, for the most part.

And yes, I do believe a lot of what the movie says (about how products consume us, how we live by what we have) but the most disturbing part is that the characters use VERY poor judgement to let out their anger. This wouldn't be that bad if the film had bombed, but the fact that it got so popular is by far more disturbing than anything this hurls at us. Why there are so many people that think what they did is justifiable is horrible. I'm  not the kind that'll say this such-and-such can effect our lives in evil ways, but yes, this has done that.

67647,"American Beauty, this chilling yet humorous look at the typical American family trapped in the world of suburbia.  The movie is all about appearances, ""In order to be successful one must project an image of success at all times.""  That is probably one of the overall themes of the movie.  Many of the characters find success to be something all their own through validation of themselves or from another, and you see how their belief in that either makes them better or tears them down.  Sam Mendes, the director of this incredible movie was able to select an awesome cast, including Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Allison Janney, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and Peter Gallagher, all of whom were able to believably bring their character life through just a look or a line.The fantastic movie and incredible cast should be enough to buy this DVD, but it is also loaded with bonus features.  The commentary is wonderful and informative, really breaking down the shots and informing you on what was cut out.  This definitely shows the insightfulness of the director on making sure that there was no unnecessary dialog that would take away from the moment.  Even the behind the scenes featurette was a pleasure to watch.If you haven't seen this movie yet, it is definitely worth you time.  The acting is superb, the quality is excellent and the features are outstanding.  American Beauty deserved all 5 Academy Awards including best picture, because this is truly ""Spec-tac-ular"".",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
180836,"I'm a big fan of Tarrentino's work, though he gets alot of bad rap I believe him to be one of the most talented writers alive, starting with Resevoir Dogs, he wrote Natural Born Killers, and Four Rooms, Desperado, and finally coming to From Dusk Till Dawn. This movie was a rocker, holding any clues or hints that there would be deradful horror in the last hour. Teaming up with horror man Robert Rodriguez, they put together this very well made horror movie about two criminal crazy boys [George Clooney, Quentin Tarrentino] who are on the run for Mexico, They kidnap a family on road [Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, and the son]and they come to a bar called the T**ty Twisters, they find that the bar is infact an eledged trap for feeding time for the vampires that inhabit it, they have to become a team with their hostages to survive, not to mention a couple other cast members; Fred Williamson, and the Sex Machine. You actually grow to admire the Gecko brothers [Clooney, Tarrentino]and Tarrentino's fine writing, alot of sick and twisted but also real features you'll see, along with bloody vampires nawing on humans, and a sided 4 man battle over a bloody severed body part battle ground, that turns to chaos. The movie was very well put together, starting out with 2 Pulp Fiction guys that run into a bunch of Fright Night vampires, the idea was to act upon the impressionable idea that Stephen King does himself in his novels, that to draw the audience into the story so that they indeed care about the characters and them BAM! vampires come along, you put the characters in this altered world of life and death. This movie is especially good on DVD, the sound is ausome along with the bonus materials, and the wide screen.",N/A
569813,"As long as you overlook the continuity aspects of the Highlander movie franchise, then this movie isn't really that bad. Personally I like all the Highlander movies-- even including Highlander 2 (the Renegade version that is), and the TV series is a classic as well.Now, on to End Game: I thought it was good, but then again I'm a big fan of Highlander... some of my friends, however, really hated the movie-- they aren't fans though. Obviously they either had problems with the continuity or they plain old just don't get Highlander. Overall it was an enjoyable movie for me, and an above average one at that. So, I'd be really happy if Duncan MacLeod appeared in at least one more movie. I think they should have Amanda in it too because they have good chemistry together. And of course don't forget about Joe and Methos. If they do make 1 more movie, then they should at least resolve some of the present issues at hand-- Adrian Paul can't play the Highlander forever and niether can Elizabeth Gracen. Anyways they could always start another TV show. How about a movie that takes place in outer space or something... or how about they discover that immortals are really hybrid aliens or something (which was hinted at in Highlander 2: The Quickening)...Now that Connor is dead (he'll always be THE Highlander to me), they can concentrate on one thing and not both. Hopefully, they (the producers) won't make any more conflicting storylines and characters, it would be nice to have a fresh new immortal created...",N/A

He does a very able job playing Grady Tripp, a creative writing instructor at a college despite his not having produced a second novel after his glittering first novel of seven years ago.  Set over a weekend, this is a comic look at everything that goes comicly wrong in Tripp's (Douglas's) life, from the women in it to the students to his literary agent and beyond.  I LOL when I saw him working on his 2,000 page book manuscript that he typed on a typewriter, for God's sake!  The fate of this manuscript during the course of this movie is pretty comedic in and of itself.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and stuck right with it.  However, I notice that a few other Amazon reviewers mention that they thought it was slow.  I didn't have that problem with it but I did notice that hubby dozed off a time or two during it.  This is not gripping, hard hitting material by any means and it is possible that others may find it slow as well.  Nevertheless, it is a good evening's entertainment for you and I recommend it.",N/A
514747,"John Leguizamo is a talented and diverse actor. Mira Sorvino also has a number of roles on her resume that distinguish her as gifted in the diversity department. These roles in Summer of Sam are not particularly flattering of their skills, nor is the script particularly well written. The script jumps around quite a bit, trying to illustrate the lives of several characters during this period of ""terror"" in New York, when a crazed, maniacal killer was running through the city murdering dark haired women. There is too much of the debauchery of the day emphasised-the drugging, the clubbing, the sex party orgies, and Leguizamo's character's complete inability to be faithful to his wife, played by Sorvino. Leguizamo is having an affair with his boss (Bebe Neuwirth) and just about all his clients (he is a hairdresser). And basically any other woman he meets. And yet he cannot seem to perform with his wife. The fact that we know all these things about him really does not lend credibility to the film . We know far more about his sexual proclivities than we know about anything else in this film. In fact it is never quite clear what we are supposed to be getting from this film.

However, in one part of the movie, when the brothers go over to Thelma Todd's house, the film in various points jumps ahead. For instance when Groucho and Zeppo are going to leave Todd's house (Groucho stays), Groucho kicks Zeppo, than the next frame Groucho runs to the window.

534750,"A Fed-Ex workaholic, recently engaged, is the sole survivor of a plane crash and survives on an uninhabited island for four years. This movie, like almost all of today's films, was poorly sold. In the space of a sixty second commercial, not only did they tell you all of the above info-admittedly this is a simple story-they also took out all of the suspense of the movie by spilling the beans about the 3rd Act and the fact that he gets rescued. All that's left to discover is the last 20 minutes. We don't know much about Hanks' character beside the fact that he's a workaholic, and that his life is dictated by the Clock. And this is where the film falls short. By not knowing what kind of man this is, or even what he thinks he is, there is nothing to discover about his transformation,of which there is very little, other than the physical. Sure there is the isolation and the depression to witness and the creation of fire and the finding of food and shelter, but there is a larger protrait missing here. It's the difference between a good film and a great film. Hanks is very, very good here, but without a truely full dimensional character to play, it's Hanks we see on the island, not Chuck Noland. Noland is more of a statistic than a character. An actress of Helen Hunt's stature, and talent, is badly needed because we can plug in bits of her other characterizations into the story to keep her presence alive. Robert Zmeckis is a good director for entertainment films, and he's got taste and class, but this film needed an artist, which Zmeckis is not. And like his other big film FORREST GUMP, you're not sure what,if anything, he's trying to say. Zmeckis is a very external director, so it's no wonder many, many people didn't get the last scene of this film. It feels like a different, and more talented director helmed this scene. It's completely at odds stylistically with the rest of the film. Like the director started using a different film language, is the best way I can explain it.No wonder many people didn't get it. It's more in the style of older foreign language films. I think it's the best scene in the film, and I wish Zmeckis had started filming this movie after shooting this scene instead of the other way 'round....As for the DVD, the DTS sound is superb and the extras at times, do a better job of defining the movie's intentions, than the film itself.",N/A
478817,"I really like this movie, and I like it even more now because of Anchor Bay's excellent work on its restoration. The picture is absolutely stunning. I won't go too much into why I like the movie, rather I'll talk about its faults. There are quite a few. Let's take the color of the blood, so crucial to the proceedings. -It unfortunately look more like paint, than real blood. Real blood is much more dark. Never mind. Then there's the Italian policeman, or rather his Italian voice. Awful !. I know they're used to dubbing in Italy, even bad dubbing, but this guy is ridiculous. -Did he think he was working on a comedy ?. Surely Argento could've stopped him. Maybe Dario thought it was funny ?. Who knows. Not too much make sense in this movie. -Like Hemmings' piano-playing character deciding to investigate on his own. And in a perfect world the DVD-people would also have gotten hold of Hemmings again, to re-voice his character's non-English scenes. But you can't have everything, of course. For some reason the most irritating event in the movie, as far as I'm concerned, is the old housekeeper who works for one of the victims. -Her employer has just been violently murdered, and she just goes about her daily business cleaning up the mess like it's the most normal thing in the world !. Mad as a hatter !. I swear I almost heard her whistle. But there are many incomprehensible, almost dream-like and surreal sequences like that. No, I don't know what the walking doll means either, but it's a nice touch. I don't mind long movies, but this one drags a bit and some of the scenes we could do without. In fact, I'm pretty sure Argento would've left the silly arm-wrestling sequence out today. -That scene just goes on and on, and they're not talking about anything important. I think Argento prefers this movie to, say, &quot;Cat O' Nine Tails&quot; which also was a long movie, but nothing was wasteful in that one. I actually think &quot;Cat...&quot; is a much better film than &quot;Deep Red&quot;. -All the scenes in &quot;Cat...&quot; needed to be there, unlike many in &quot;Deep Red&quot;. In retrospect, the restoration of &quot;Deep Red&quot;, as commendable as it is, seems a bit like a case of &quot;it was possible, so we did it&quot;, but it wasn't really necessary. The film is a welcome, but strange curio now. My favorite sequences in &quot;Deep Red&quot; are the snake-like p.o.v. shots of different objects, the hallway of paintings, and Hemmings two visits to the empty villa. Lovers of (arty) '70s thrillers can't go wrong with this movie.",Deep Red VHS
310242,"First came Goldfinger, then Diamonds Are Forever.  These are the two greatest Bond movies with Connery in the title role.  Both have great villians, and to be a great Bond movie, there must be a great villian.  Connery has never been more comfortable in the role of Bond.  He shows it all in this movie:  charm, wit, luck, indifference to authority, grace under pressure, worldliness, weariness, and humility.  Is this not one of the most fascinating characters ever portrayed on film?  I've seen every Bond film again and again.  Connery is the best Bond, because the more you think you understand about Bond, the more you feel that there is still more to know.  None of the Bond actors communicates this better than Connery.  It is what gives Bond his unpredictability, and makes you feel that you can't take your eyes off him even for a moment, because of what he might do to surprise you.  If I could own only three Bond films with Connery in the lead role, then From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, and this one, would pretty well sum up the whole series.  The rest are highly repetitive fair to poor copies.",N/A
262036,"&quot;Nightbreed&quot;, based on the book &quot;Cabal&quot; by Clive Barker.Directing from a screenplay of his own novel, Barker's film is unfortunately inconsistent in both style and tone, and the plot meanders somewhat inconsequentially. Also lacking are the more homoerotic undertones of the novel, although a certain amount remains between Craig Scheffer's Boone and the decidedly sexually-appealing monster Peloquin (played by actor/director Oliver Parker).Boone is plagued by memories of a place he has never seen, with his visions twisted by psychotic psychologist Decker, played by David Cronenberg. Boone seeks out this place and eventually finds himself in Midian, which we discover is 'where the monsters' go. What is interesting about Barker's film is the perspective taken here; the film attempts to lay our sympathy with the creatures who are persecuted and slaughtered by the redneck police force, and does so with some success. Despite its major flaws, Nightbreed does succeed in eliciting a strong degree of emotion for the monsters, no doubt inspired by Barker's own homosexuality; while the direction is messy and the production design glaringly inconsistent throughout, the film does at least compensate for these flaws in its humanity.",N/A
531511,"One does try as hard as one can to avoid the working classes, although poverty and lack of transport make this problematic.  If curiosity about how they actually live their lives gets the better of one then what safer way than home video?  My last such glimpse into a strange and unfamiliar world was through Ken Loach's 'Kes', in which a frustrated and alienated young boy, cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a Kestrel.  Quickly crushing any aesthesia brought on by Loach's compassion for the great unwashed, it has taken the hyperbol surrounding 'Billy Elliot' to take me less than expeditiously down memory lane once more.  How have the lives of the working classes changed thirty years on?  Apparently they sleep two to a bedroom instead of six as I had once erroneously supposed and have inside toilets.  When a solitary worker has the temerity to want to do a day's work he is chased through a succession of working class dwellings by fifty riot police in full regalia until caught.  It's gratifying to see such a realistic prioritizing of police resources on film and the comforting knowledge of the tax payer's money well spent.  Apart from that, little has changed except for one egrigious detail.  Your actual working classes pirouette down the high street. Billy Elliot, a frustrated and alienated young boy cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a ballet tutu.  Also, his second best friend just might be a transvestite.  This irresponsibility on the part of the British film industry should not go unanswered.  This is not Hampstead.  Encouraging the lower orders to experience culture only leads to books, and books lead to union membership and then (God help us) secret ballots. I think the need to appeal to the American market has reared it's capitulant head here.  Pleas for sexual tolerance and finding your inner child are more important than a roof over one's head and the dignity of (hard) labour.  Kestrels are aggressive, macho symbols that may lower the tone and pull a boy's false eye lashes off.  Of course, we must take all these changes on trust, but how accurate is this to real working class lives?  Unlike the ending to 'Kes' which leaves the audience basking in the warm glow of their own undoubtedly justified prejudices, 'Billy Elliot' leaves us suspicious and distrustful at it's challenge to the natural order.  Yes, we may let the odd one escape to become rock musicians, sportsman and soap stars, but let us not get carried away.  This is an American fortune cookie, not OUR Britain, thank you very much.Now, one may be prepared to sit through working class life when the film making calibre of Ken Loach is involved, but when confronted by the almost obdurately dire artistic decisions and cack direction of Stephen Daldry, the urge to hit the off switch is overwhelming.  There are, no doubt, worse experiences one might be subjected to in one's drawing room than 'Billy Elliot' such as listening to pibroch while having your leg chewed off by a shark, but it's a close run thing.  It may be in the unlikely event prejudice (heaven forbid), but I thought this film was quite staggeringly, fall off Ben Nevis bad.  It's jocund liveliness cannot hide it's jejunity (and trying saying that fast, I guarantee it will be more comprehensible than 'Billy Elliot'). And if I have to endure one more scene in which a minor turns to another minor (as opposed to a miner) and after a long pause says &quot;do you want to play hide the salami with me&quot; or words to that effect, I shall emigrate to Botswana and I don't even know where that is.  Do contemporary writers think this is cute and cuddly coming from children, as opposed to deeply creepy put in their mouths by an adult?  May I suggest that in an act of charity not dissimilar to their salt of the earth goodness depicted in 'Billy Elliot', our actual working classes band together to confer on the writer Mr Hall, the useful and life changing gift of an escritoire?",N/A

Also included is a photo stills gallery of collector Wes Shank's Blob collection, including the famous red silicone masquerading as a man-eating monster from outer space.For casual fans of the film, however, this version (from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks, distributed by Front Row Video) is serviceable enough with VHS-like viewing quality.

The script is very witty, even to the point of being really good, but the developement of its characters is sadly lacking. Heath Ledger's character, Patrick Verona (the male lead), goes too easily from &quot;tough and scary&quot; to &quot;sweet and sensitive&quot;, without anything to make us believe it. Since the dialogue shows no evidence of his being in love with Kat (Julia Stiles) until he comes out and says it, it's rather hard to believe. Juliat Stiles character has a similiar problem, going from &quot;grumpy loner&quot; to &quot;happy teen&quot; in hardly a blink. Of course, one hardly notices due to these young actors supurb preformances.The co-stars steal the show, however. The bumbling new kid who falls for the sweet and popular, if a little shallow, Bianca (Kat's sister) is so likable I wish the story focused on him and all his troubles, and his quirky new friend has some great lines.

530958,"I recently wrote a review for &quot;Blow&quot; comparing it to &quot;Traffic&quot; (which I thought was overhyped and overrated).  It's easy for me to lump all these movies together because of they all share the same theme: drugs.  Let me be blunt, comparing those other two movies (even Blow which I enjoyed) to Requiem is like comparing &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot; to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.  No contest.If you're already on edge worrying about current events and world conditions STAY AWAY FROM THIS FLICK.  It might be enough to drive you right over the edge.  It's like an anxiety attack in a bottle.  It's so real and so intense that for me, I had to keep reminding myself it was just a movie, which is something I rarely have to do.  If you've ever had a family member who's battled a drug habit, or had a drug habit yourself, this flick will stand your hairs on end.  All the mania and euphoria of drugs is shrouded by a sense of loss and disappointment that almost always comes to those who clean up, or lose their personal battles.No doubt it's director Darren Aronofsky's deranged camera angles and constant bombardment of imagery that contribute most to the film's power and intensity.  It has all the subtlety of a gamg of thugs armed with chains and clubs beating you senseless without ever allowing you a moment to catch your breath.  Even the quiet moments are filled with so much heartbreaking tragedy that the viewer is allowed no reprieve.Incredible performances all four main players.  Ellen Burstyn deserves every kind of award that an actress can get, but it was Marlon Wayans performance that kept me in awe because it was just so unexpected.  Wayans shows that he has the talent and the skill to be a true heavy weight.  The interaction between Jared Leto and the always underrated Jennifer Connelly was what I found most disturbing about the flick.  Watching their relationship disintegrate is just too convincing and genuine at times.So to sum up... I'm not sure how to sum this movie up.  It's not for the faint of heart.  It is for anyone who's sick of the mediocre b.s. that hollywood has been pumping down our throats.  A movie like this comes out every once and awhile and makes you remember why you watch movies.

It was obvious right from the beginning that these were people we were going to like and watch for years. It was also obvious that these actors were a strong bunch of people with instant charm and chemistry. This two volume collection contains some great episodes. You get the Pilot episode which, if you haven't seen lately, is a real hoot to see them looking so different. You get hilarious episodes like &quot;The One Where No One's Ready&quot;, which is kind of seinfeldian in a way. But, the top episodes is &quot;The One With The Prom Video&quot;. A classic!.

468763,"David Cronenberg is a very sick man. Everytime I tape another one of his movies &amp; sit down to watch it, I wonder about an industry that would continue to give this man money with which to record his personal obsessions. Of course, the fact that I find it necessary to tape &amp; watch the films provides the answer!&quot;eXistenZ&quot; is, in a nutshell, Cronenberg's return to the themes of his first film &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Since &quot;Videodrome&quot; was produced at the dawn of the cable era, it used the video aspect of modern society to make its' points. Now that computer gaming is so much a part of modern society, Cronenberg has found an even more potent tool for his surgical dissections of mass media.To viewers who haven't seen this earlier work, Cronenberg's repeated use of &quot;bioports&quot;, &quot;gamepods&quot; &amp; other artifacts of mutant genentech may seem ripped out of William Gibson's later works. However, &quot;Videodrome&quot; presented us with repellent representations of man merging with plastic way back in the late 70's (well before Gibson was a household name). The vision however has grown much darker. We've watched the progression thru the intermediate works of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, &quot;the Krays&quot; &amp; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; but &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is so dark as to be almost unwatchable at times.I realize I am completely ignoring any plot synopses, but you can read other reviews for that. I will mention that Jennifer Jason Leigh does excellent work as the &quot;demoness Allegra Geller&quot; &amp; Jude Law does an excellent &quot;PR nerd&quot; keeping an American accent credibly thruout.Will you enjoy &quot;eXistenZ&quot;? That depends on your gross-out factor. If you enjoy watching amorphous pulsating blobs slithering into apertures in people's spinal columns, the answer is a resounding YES. For the rest of us, the answer is a little more ambivalent. The issues dealt with are important &amp; thought- provoking. It is the manner in which Cronenberg chooses to present them that makes me state he is a very sick man!",Existenz VHS
547983,"What you might expect to find on Volume 1 of ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series would be the pilot episode, but that proves not to be the case. What you will find are a trio of classic episodes where the performances by the actors are as memorable as the stories with their infamous ""Twilight Zone"" twists that characterized Rod Serling's celebrated television anthology series:Episode 51, ""The Invaders"" (Written by Richard Matheson, First aired January 27,1 961) offers a tour de force performance by Agnes Moorhead, long after she appeared in ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" for Orson Welles, and shortly before she became Endora on ""Bewitched."" Moorhead plays a woman living alone in a farmhouse who finds that a miniature flying saucer has landed on her roof. The woman has to fight against the strange tiny invaders with their advanced technology. But then remember, this is ""The Twilight Zone.""Episode 47, ""Night of the Meek"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired December 23, 1960) is the only Christmas episode in the original run of ""The Twilight Zone."" Poor Henry Corwin (Art Carney), a department store Santa, shows up drunk on Christmas Eve and is fired. Wandering the streets, he discovers a magic bag that can dispense any gift he asks for. The question is, what will Henry do with this most unusual bag? If you are a fan of the ""Zone"" then you have probably heard the legend that Serling wrote the episode just to see Art Carney play Santa Claus. The excellent support casts features two of the best character actors of all time with John Fielder as Henry's short-tempered boss and Burt Mustin as a friendly bum on the streets, but this is Art Carney's triumph. The episode was one of six shot during the second season on videotape instead of film, but that is a minor complaint because it just makes ""Night of the Meek"" seem like a live television broadcast from the 1950s.Episode 81, ""Nothing in the Dark"" (Written by George Clayton Johnson, First aired January 5, 1962) offers veteran character actress Gladys Cooper as Wanda Dunn, an old woman who has barricaded herself in her basement apartment for years, fearing that Mr. Death with kill her with a touch. Wanda knows that Death can take many disguises. But despite her fears, when Harold Beldon, a young policeman is shot outside her door, she drags him inside. Of course, the fact Beldon is played by Robert Redford might have something to do with her letting her guard down. A nice little grace note from the ""Zone.""his DVD includes ""Inside The Twilight Zone"", with information on Rod Serling, a history of the series, reviews of each episode, cast information and a season-by-season commentary. Not a bad first disc, but there is much better to come (Volume 2 is the best in the series). However, you will not find a better trio of performances than you find here with Moorhead, Carney and Cooper.  Plus that Redford fellow is not bad looking.  Whatever happened to him?",N/A

583695,"As if we didn't have enough ghostly little tales in the past few years (The Sixth Sense, Stir Of Echoes, etc.), another comes down the pike with an interesting twist - the main character doesn't see ghosts, but she definitely knows when people are going to die.  The idea for the story supposedly based upon the psychic abilities of Virginia Faulkner Thornton (Billy Bob Thornton's mother - she predicted his Oscar win), ""The Gift"" is a trim little package of murder, trepidation and the supernatural, peppered with an all-star cast and crew of Oscar winners (Swank, Thornton) and nominees (Blanchett, Kinnear, Harris).Annie Wilson (Blanchett) is a humble mother of three quietly making a living in fictional Brixton, GA off of social security from her husband's death and performing psychic readings for the townspeople.  Her recitations consist of one burning taper and a bizarre deck of cards with various symbols (star, circle, wavy lines, etc.) printed on them.  Her abilities as a clairvoyant are honest and true but (wouldn't you know it) Brixton is a backwoods community full of conservatives, skeptics and zealous Christians that believe the reserved widow is a practicing witch.  One man in particular named Donnie Barksdale (Reeves) harbors a special hatred for Annie because his battered wife Valerie (Swank) has been visiting the psychic's home on a regular basis to receive readings.  Donnie harasses Annie, making direct threats to her and her sons and even breaking into her home to creatively render the word ""Satan"" with her cosmic deck.  When Jessica King, the aristocratic daughter (Holmes) of a Brixton bigwig, turns up missing Annie has a vision that will help the BPD locate her.  She is at first snubbed by the chief of police for her marked reputation but when authorities finally take a chance on her, Jessica's body is found on Donnie Barksdale's property and he is immediately taken into custody for her murder. There's a bigger game afoot however, and Annie must single-handedly solve the mystery before the killer attempts to silence her permanently.Blanchett does her best to look simultaneously frightened and determined as Annie, a woman who is against all odds.  We already have proof of her abilities as a dramatic actress (Elizabeth, Paradise Road) and she is not disappointing here, sporting a decent Georgian accent and making her character human despite her inhuman abilities.  Holmes looks too young for her role and it's hard to fathom the chemistry between the 22-year-old actress and her 38-year-old co-star Kinnear (my husband even remarked that she looked like a teenager wearing her mother's clothes).  It's even more weird to see her sexing up ""Office Space"" yeeah-guy Gary Cole (who is 45) in a scene involving bathroom whoopie.  I guess it's just another case of casting directors pitting a beautiful ing&eacute;nue with a handsome fogey twice their age (a la Richard Gere/Winona Ryder, Bo Derek/Dudley Moore, etc.).  Kinnear does an admirable job as Wayne Collins, but a project like this is too simple an undertaking for his acting skills; most likely it was a labor of love for him.  Reeves actually manages to himself seem intimidating as Donnie Barksdale and Swank plays another dimwitted southerner minus the sexual identity crisis.  Oscar nominee Rosemary Harris makes a brief appearance as Blanchett's intuitive grandmother.  Ribisi is the standout here as the erratic Buddy Cole, a man who is consistently on the precipice of a psychological meltdown.  He is a blubbering, tearful mess one minute, hot-blooded and precarious the next.  What is really compelling about Ribisi's performance is the inner turmoil divulged in his roan and expressive eyes.  We know all we need to know about his character's struggle to stay sane simply by surveying his face.  Not a lot of actors have the ability to embody their characters in this way and Ribisi is to be commended for making Buddy a dynamic and remarkable individual.  Although he has yet to get the Academy's attention, the future looks incredibly bright for him and it's almost certain that he will become a hot commodity in the next few years.""The Gift"" delivers most of what it promises but sci-fi/horror fans will most likely be disappointed by its artsy approach (compliments of director Sam Raimi), its failure to scare the bejesus out of them (The Gift has MINOR scares) and its sad predictability.  The story manages to point an accusing finger at everyone but about halfway through (or even sooner) it's easy to identify the culprit.  If you're looking for a semi-suspenseful flick with a distinct and talented cast, ""The Gift"" is an ideal and enjoyable rent.",N/A

We get a lot of great seasoned performers : Piper Laurie, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, Jon Stewart, Bebe Neuwirth, Famke Jenssen, and Christopher MacDonald. The kids are all good.

661393,"I'll admit from the start; I'm kind of a sucker for hype.  When I hear so many positive things about a new anime, and I read all the great things critics and magazines have to say about it before it comes out, I get excited.  And once in a good while, as soon as I see it at my local video store, I'll snatch it off the shelf without a second thought.  This was one of those cases.  And for once, I didn't regret it.  ""Blood"" is spectacular, and on just about every level.  The story, basically about a mysterious young girl who hunts shape-shifting vampires (I know, you've heard this before somewhere...), goes into just enough detail to set the tone but leaves the viewer hungry (or is it...thirsty?) for more by the end.  The setting, at Yokota Air Force Base in Japan during the Vietnam war, is dead-on accurate; the buildings, the runway, especially the aircraft, are in immaculate detail.  Even the airmen's uniforms match the time period!  My hat is off to the background and storyboard teams.  I've never seen backgrounds and surroundings look so realistic in an animated film!  Speaking of animation, it just doesn't get much better.  The animators created an unrivaled blend of 2D and 3D CGI.  I've seen such a blend in other anime, but it's difficult to put the two together and make it look natural.  This piece of work, though, is flawless.  The 2D characters flow perfectly into the backgrounds and CGI surroundings, as if they actually belong there.  Being a horror flick, the use of color was a perfect match for the gloomy setting; lots of good use of shadow, dark colors, and tones.  The soundtrack fits like a glove, too; the orchestrated music set the moods of the scenes and just amplified their intensity.  ""Blood"" is, in my opinion, pound for pound one of the best anime out there right now.  Folks, this is pretty much the future of anime.  I highly recommend you grab a piece of it and see it for yourself.  As far as the DVD features go, there's a photo gallery (which is kind of lame) and some previews of other Manga titles.  The best extra by far, though, is the ""making of"" featurette.  It reveals just how much time, effort, and talent went into this little morsel.  I tell you true, the only problem I have with this DVD is that the way the story ended, we're going to have to wait for ""Blood: Part 2"".

Another Best Picture Oscar-winner has allowed me to shed my tears freely and openly.Based on the novel by Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove, The Last Picture Show), TERMS OF ENDEARMENT is a &quot;family&quot; film that deals with a 30-year relationship between a flighty mother and her headstrong daughter, played to perfection by Shirley MacLaine as Aurora Greenway, and Debra Winger as her daughter Emma Horton. The film begins by establishing the relatonship between the neurotic Aurora with her young daughter.It makes you laugh and it makes you cry! Either way, the film deserves its kudos. Created by future SIMPSONS producer James L.

You have to be patient considering that the final climax, in which Emma loses her fight with cancer, is the blow that sent me (and possibly millions of other viewers) into tears. Watch Aurora's face; watch Emma's, and you'll know exactly what they're saying without them even saying a word.

Outlaw Star is a well-done, if not thoroughly original, science fiction/action show.

With an intriguing story that pulled the audience in week after week, it was considered one of the most innovative show of its time, and it still is.The pilot presents the genesis of the show, having Sam, the main character, forgetting (almost) completely who he is, where and when he's from and how he got in into the 1950's.  The only thing he does know is that he does not belong where he is.  During the show, Sam gradually learns more about himself and the project he was working on.Quote from Sam, as he realize his predicament: &quot;Okay, it's not a dream.  It's a nightmare.  And if it's a nightmare, then sooner or later, there's going to be a Boogeyman!&quot;  Then enter the Boogeyman, or Albert (&quot;Al&quot;), the observer from his own time...What is remarkable about this television series is that the emphasis is on the personal and social interactions between Sam, Al, and the people around them, not on the science-fiction element of the show.  No techno-babble.  Not many special effects.  Also, the chemistry between Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell is something to be seen.Sam is presented as quite vulnerable, not the typical lone hero with an attitude.  Sam is acted as an ordinary man (relatively speaking, as Sam has six doctorates) stuck in an extraordinary situation.  Al is the sidekick, and comic relief of the show.The pilot actually presents two &quot;leaps&quot;: one into a test pilot, the other, shorter, into a baseball player.  I do not want to spoil too much the ending, but this episode does end with the typical cliffhanger, leaping into another person, in another time, and into an awkward situation...The DVD itself is plain vanilla.

Tawny Madison&quot; by Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), &quot;Dr. Lazarus&quot; by Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), &quot;Tech Sergeant Chen&quot; by Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and &quot;Lieutenant Trek Laredo&quot; by Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell). But after four years, the show was cancelled, leaving the actors and actresses without any jobs. Twenty years later, at a convention center, they meet up with aliens Commander Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees), Quellek (Patrick Breen), and Laliari (Missi Pyle). They are from the alien race Thermians (or Termites! (you'll have to watch the movie to understand!)) and having mistaken the Galaxy Quest TV show for 'historical documents', they request the 'crew' to help them negotiate the terms with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs). But of course, things don't go they way they seem since the actors are now playing for their lives! And with the help of Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), if you could call him 'help', and Galaxy Quest fan Brandon (Justin Long), they set out to save the universe.Witty and funny, this movie will keep you in stiches throughout the whole 1 hour and 42 minutes of it! Acting is marvelous with Tim Allen as the 'raving ego-maniac', Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Gwen (watching her you won't be able to believe that she's in her 50's!!), and Alan Rickman as the serious English actor.Though there's nothing bad about this movie, there are some innuendos and some bad language henceforth the PG rating.

It may not be on par with the remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (also by Baker), but just watch the Japanese movie &quot;King Kong Vs. Godzilla&quot; to see how GOOD Baker's design really is.It is an interesting 70's time capsule, with Lange's Marilyn Monroe-esque acting, Jeff Bridge's hippie hair-do and &quot;Greenpeace&quot; attitude, and Charles Grodin's oil-obsessed hysteria. Remember the gas lines of the mid-70's? This movie will remind you.Some of the special effects are dated by today's terms, but that's okay. Enjoy the 1976 version of &quot;King Kong&quot; on its own merits: just inoffensive good fun. After all, where else can you see King Kong blow the wet Jessica Lange dry? With puffy cheeks, no less?",N/A
469039,"Underrated, this is a hardcore, dark, macabre masterpiece. Guy Pearce (Captain John Boyd) is a soldier, who, though decorated, is actually a coward. After faking death in a battle against Mexicans, he is tossed among the dead in the enemy's encampment. He crawls out from a beneath a pile of oozing bodies and successfully takes the base from the enemy. His commander knows he isn't a real soldier and so, as he is disgusted by the sight of him but for politics sake can't reprimand him, the captain is sent to an isolated military outpost called Fort Spencer. Living there is a skeleton crew assisted by several indians and everything goes fine until a near dead man(Robert Carlyle) staggers into camp during the middle of a very cold winter. After being warmed up and fed, he tells a grisly tale of desperate cannibalism as he and the party he was traveling with got punished by the elements and were forced into a cave. A select small band soldiers and one indian set out to assist the remaining people in the cave, who by chance might just still be alive and so the movie truly begins. Nothing is quite what it seems as the twists and turns reveal the terrifying realities of the plot which eventually climax in a very satisfying and unexpected ending. The acting is excellent all around but especially with Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. The weak nature and mental struggles of Guy Pearce are incredibly believable and completely balance the innocent appearance yet sinister nature of Robert Carlyle. The cinematography creates a creepy, desolate atmosphere as the ingenious soundtrack(as good or better than that of Suspiria) by Damon Albarn and Michael Nyman truly fits ever scene and action, allowing for a true horror experience to be felt. With moments of twisted humor tastefully spread throughout, this is the total horror package and definitely not a movie to be rented...it should be purchased.",N/A

552864,"The movie tells that a blind child Mohammed came to his village with his reluctant father from the school in Tehran. There he lived with his grandmother, his father and his two sisters. His father wanted to remarry and was worried by the fact that he had a blind son. He wanted to send Mohammed to a blind carpenter as a apprentice. But the kind grandmother rejected that. When one day his father took Mohammed away to the carpenter, his grandmother grieved and passed away soon. The fiancee's family rejected the marriage because they saw the death as an ominous sign for the marriage. When the father brought Mohammed back in a rainy day, Mohammed slipped into the flooding brook and flowed away. His father jumped into the brook and pursuit him. Eventually he found Mohammed's body and held it in deep sorrow.The movie is so beautifully shot. The cinematography is superb. A few scenes are breathtakingly stunning:1. When the grandmother knew that his son had taken his grandson away, she stood desolately in sadness. The snowwhite chicken feathers were whirling lightly aournd her and the movie turned into silence. Without a single word, the love of the grandmother to her grandson was brilliantly presented.2.When the grandmother passed away, the old lady was like a goddess as the camera closed to her serene face. The screen lightened up and very tender music raised after a while of complete silence. I could hardly believe she had passed away although I knew she actually had. Purely poetical!3. At the end of the movie, when Mohammed was flooded away, I was extremely sad and felt helpless. His father eventually found his body. He held the body and wept deeply. the camera lingered at the hand of the boy. The fingers moved, the screen was brightened up. At that moment I was totally mesmerized and felt no more sadness. The movie beautifully ended there, as I was left utterly speechless.One of the disgusting things about a lot of these days' movies is pretension and affectation--corny love must be accompanied by grandiose soundtrack and our feelings towards the movies are therefore misled and become untrue. In contrast, a lot of Iranian movies have very little musical score, touching the souls purely by acting and photography. The color of paradise, instead using bunch of music, use elements of true lives, such as the sound of woodpeckers, which makes the movie uncommonly refreshing.Believe me to watch the color of paradise, to experience the genuine soul-touching movie making!",The Color of Paradise
37168,"First of all I have to say that &quot;dog park&quot; is one of a kind when it comes to brig cute dogs to the screen, but on the other hand, the film has nothing new about relationships and love affairs.&quot;Dog...&quot; is about a man (Luke Wilson), whose beloved ex-girlfriend has given him over and taken the dog as souvenir. He meets a woman (Natasha Henstrige), and falls for her, but she is not very interested in having a love affair right now -- at least with him. And this is the way the movies goes... Nothing new or exciting -- apart from the dogs that could have had a much bigger part in this misguided flick.They are the stars and steal any scene they are in (Not that would have been a very difficult task due to the cast they acted with, but anyway they do steal). The pets are treatead as it they were a kid, so they go to 'school', go to a shrink and family sessions... and get graduated. But the human beings also wanted to have a part in the story and this is when the movie becomes a whole mess.Luke Wilson plays his usual role: the nice, a bit silly and single guy. Natasha Henstrige tries hard but can't avoid her femme fatale look. She palys a Mrs booksworm in a TV show, but she does not look like the kind of girl we expect to be reading for our children. Plus, they have no chermistry together, you don't give a damn if they'll get married or kill each other.Many directors have tried to copycat Altman, putting some characters together in a web that is revealed little by little. Some have succed, but many have failed. This film belongs to the second option. If this strategy is not well done, it looks like the characters of the movie are the only human beings on earth, and not that casuallity put them together.To sum up, if you really really really like dogs, watch this film but fastfoward the scenes which they are not in. And my two stars go, of course, to the canines!",N/A

118785,"Kubrick's last film is an existential tour de force.  It is a fascinating exploration into the sexual mores of modern man, handled with a masterful melding of subject matter and style that is typical of Kubrick.  Nudity is plentiful, but there is hardly any overt sex, for one of the movie's themes is REPRESSION.  The duality of human nature (recalling the line in FULL METAL JACKET) is once again the driving force of the plot: love/hate, honesty/deceit, reality/fantasy, freedom/repression, etc.  Kitman's performance is great.  Cruise's is alright.  Kubrick, well, is Kubrick.This DVD is the R-rated version, and so is the remastered DVD edition to be released this June.

The combinaton of high camp, low budget, charismatic actors in over the top farcical roles, the slice of 1970s stereotype, all add up to terrific entertainment. what I was really surprised at watching Across 110th Street is that cheap (and plentiful) gore notwithstanding this film is a work of art. Sure blaxploitation stallwarts like Antonio Fargas and Yaphet Koto are here. Sure there are cartoonishly racist white cops, racist Italian mobsters, parasitically pimpin' black criminals, longsuffering and abused black women, just like most of these flicks. But there is also a real sense of drama here. The timing and camera work, the characterization and detail, are all a step above the standard. The acting is generally witty and convincing. Makes me wish I knew more about this film and where it fit in the development of the genre.It gets only 4 stars because the DVD lacks special features. A commentary track would have been great.",N/A
455847,"Clever dialogue, reality-tinged relationships, and the slow-moving hands of fate converge in this overlooked indie film. Hope Davis gives an understated and convincing performance as Erin, a nurse (med school dropout) whose long-time live-in radical activist boyfriend (a brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman) leaves her in the first moments of the movie. She seems to enjoy her single life, but her mother (Holland Taylor) doesn't think single life is healthy and places a personal ad on Erin's behalf. Meanwhile, a parallel story ensues about a man, presumably with some shady/underworld connections, leaving the plumbing industry to pursue his dream of becoming a marine biologist. Throughout the movie, this man's path crosses Erin's path, but they never meet. When Erin decides to check her personal ad mailbox, she finds that she has received an overwhelming response and decides to go on several dates (this is a fascinating part of the film), including a date with the plumber-turned-biologist's brother. The film is not a masterpiece, but it is a lighthearted look at single life and people's interactions. It explores some genuine perspectives on interacting with other people and finding the right connections to make these interactions into something more substantial.

447148,"The concept behind this movie--that space aliens in disguise run this planet &amp; enslave working class humans--may be harder to swallow than Marx's class-war scenarios, but I enjoy the way it unfolds throughout the first part of the movie. The genius of taking a social situation and explaining it with a bizarre conspiracy fires the dynamo of this movie's appeal. I dare you to look at politics today &amp; tell me grotesque extra-terrestrials in disguise don't run the nation! We're living the sequel: THEY LIVE 2, How Space Aliens Stole Election 2K!This movie is set in the great Reagan/Bush Era worker displacement &amp; recession. The Wise Republican Presidents had lowered taxes, increased government size, increased government spending (duh!), and grossly increased the national debt (DUHHH!!!) While this created great contentment among the upper crust, it also produced lots of unemployed &amp; displaced workers, ready to do anything for a buck.Our hero wants to work, but can only get day labor, off the books. He lives at a homeless encampment &amp; notices a brutal raid by the LAPD on a small church with an ensuing dragnet through the homeless encampment. He follows clues and comes to see the world through new lenses, lenses that reveal a stark contrast between appearance and underlying reality. Once the blinding dazzle of consumer society has been blocked, the hero can better see the how the media controls the populace. I found this metaphor brilliant--appealing to both mind and heart. Without it, the movie would have lost a star.The first part of the flick is innovative and original. I like the way the underlying premise is slowly revealed. But once the secret is out of the bag, the movie deteriorates rapidly. My son, age 12 when he first watched it with me, kept saying &quot;Dad, why doesn't he do ______?&quot; Sure enough, a few seconds later, the hero would do exactly that! Although the basic premise and some of the underlying metaphors deserve 6 stars, the predictability, and gradual erosion of creativity throughout the movie knocks it down to a four star flick.There are good reasons why this movie never won any awards at Cannes. But it's still fun to watch at least once, and then maybe again with your kids. If you're a 12-year-old boy, it's probably fun to watch every weekend until you're 13.This movie does have one of the most memorable bad lines of any movie in it, one nearly worth the price of purchase:&quot;I'm here to chew gum and kick ass ... and I'm all out of bubblegum!&quot;(If you enjoyed this review, please read my others here at Amazon.

44286,"Citizen X is a deceptively simple film that tells the true story of the Soviet Union's most notorious seriel killer, Andrie Chikatilo.  Played by a chillingly nondescript Jeffrey DeMunn, Chikatilo kills 52 people (including children) over an 8 year time span.  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the film (and the murders themselves) is that Chikatilo was not some Hannibal Lectorish genius nor was he a Ted Bundy-type who hid his evil behind a facade of normalcy. Instead (in the film, at least) he comes across as a rather pathetic man whose guilt would be obvious to just about anyone who came across him.  However, as the movie explains, Chikatilo is lucky enough to be committing his crimes in the Soviet Union; the leaders of which refuse to acknowledge that any citizen of a truly communist state could still be so sick as to commit such terrible crimes against his fellow workers.  This is not an obviously political movie and it certainly never makes the mistake of distorting the facts for the sake of propaganda.  However, it does carry a very important subtext -- i.e., when a society refuses to acknowledge the importance of the flawed individual over the faceless and nameless mass, men like Chikatilo emerge from the shadows of that society's willfull ignorance.  (One is reminded, in fact, of how the search for Jack the Ripper was hindered by the Victorian sensibility that the murderer had to be the member of a certain gender and social class.)The police detective who eventually captured Chikatilo (with little help whatsoever from his superiors) is well-played by Stephen Rea who brings a low-key sadness to the role.  Eschewing the stereotypical &quot;supercop&quot; role that seems to show up in most recent police procedurals, Rea instead emphasizes his character's innate decency.  When he becomes obsessed with finding and capturing Chikatilo, it is not portrayed as some sort of cat-and-mouse melodrama but instead the reaction of an inherently good man who cannot sit idly by.  In perhaps the film's most riveting moment, Rea shocks his superiors by breaking down into tears when they refuse his request for more aid.  Its an unexpectedly human moment and its impact is devastating, especially when Rea's superiors respond to his unexpected emotions with the same disbelief given to the idea that the Soviet Union could spawn a seriel killer.The film is very well directed by Chris Gerolmo who, for the most part, resists the temptation to sensationalize the crimes or play for cheap reactions.  He emphasizes the starkness of communist Russia and supplies the film with an even pace that, while never boring, will probably catch viewers looking for a schlocky thriller off guard.Obviously, all of this could add up to a pretty heavy and depressing film and Gerolmo, smartly, does provide the story with some much needed comic relief by casting Donald Sutherland as Rea's only ally in the communist leadership.  Sutherland gives an excellent performance (for which I believe he won an emmy) and brings a slyly sarcastic touch to many of his lines.  Rea and Sutherland make a likeable team and their scenes together have a warmth that this chilly film needs.  As well, Max Von Sydow shows up in one of the roles he seems to specialize in; a cameo as a psychologist who provides a state-forbidden profile of Chikatilo.  Von Sydow does a great job; as does the rest of the film.",N/A
134807,"&quot;Rocky&quot; is one of the great classic films that stands the test of time. This is an original, entertaining and captivating movie. Instead of using large, complex brushstrokes, it makes a great story out of ordinary people. Sylvester Stallone gives a great performance as Rocky, he's not some brute tough-guy, he's just a nice guy who is suddenly given a big chance at his sport. The screenplay by Stallone is an authentic and intriguing journey into the world of boxing, and the side storylines do not interrupt the film's structure but flow along with it. There is also sweet, uplifting romance with the story of Rocky and Adrian (played by Talia Shire, sister of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola). The boxing scenes are exhilarating and exciting, especially the final boxing climax at the end. Overall, &quot;Rocky&quot; is an inspiring movie because it gives hope that people can get a chance at big things, that we can strive for more, and if we work hard and use our minds, we can excell. &quot;Rocky&quot; seems simple, but has strong things to say at its core.

660651,"If your expecting an outrageously campy comedy ala' Priscilla, Queen of the Desert or a film like Strictly Ballroom. . . you'll be very disappointed by this one. Although it's written by the writer of The Full Monty, it's a film that misses more opportunities to be funny than it hits. The fact that a lot of that is intentional is not necessarily a good thing at all. It's also the third film of the late 2000/2001 season that's about hair dressers or wigs ( An Everlasting Piece, The Big Tease ).As the film introduces us to its characters we quickly learn than one of them is dying from cancer. This immediately tells us the film is probably not going to be one full of outrageous and John Waters' like camp comedy (Hairspray, Polyester, Pink Flamingos), but rather be more of a bittersweet, heart-warming romantic comedy of a film that has a pretty interesting gimmick --the hair dressing competition. It doesn't seem to be quite sure what it wants to be as it gives us a main character dying of a disease, a Romeo and Juliet type romance, and a low key Rocky kind of film all delivered with a package that should have been over-the-top campy but isn't.The most famous and respected hairstylists from around the world descend upon the tiny Yorkshire village for the annual hairdressing Championships. We meet former resident Bill(Nighy), a cheating egotist who has brought his estranged daughter Christina (Cook) with him to possibly use as his colorist. Bill also learns his ex chief rival Phil (Rickman) is in town and he can hardly wait to gloat over how much more successful and famous he's become. Phil is divorced and has traded in his gold show scissors to run his modest local barber shop with his son, Brian (Hartnett) while not speaking to his ex-wife Shelley (Richardson) who's in a lesbian relationship with his former hair model Rachel (Griffiths). Shelley and Rachel run a full service salon across town. If this isn't sounding too funny to you.. you're right. It isn't. It isn't supposed to be either. But while these aren't the typical characters we've seen in domestic dramas, we've seen the circumstances for this type of drama too many times to be moved or all that interested in any of it.Good thing we're watching charismatic performances. It is also no big surprise that these characters will eventually be involved with each other again and be competing in the hair dressing contest--exactly as you expect. It's probably not a good sign when what should be a quirky out of the ordinary comedy begins with too heavy a helping of pathos and then becomes and remains extremely predictable from start to finish. Most viewers will be way ahead of the film, and there's not real surprises being offered except perhaps that is not nearly as outrageous or campy as you might be expecting it to be. I won't tell you too much more than that about the film because there aren't all that many surprises or laughs in the film and if you are going to enjoy it all you don't need me ruining some of the film's modest surprises.There are several recognizable faced in the film's cast and they are all quite good in their roles. Alan Rickman however is almost too low key for the majority of the film and that's another missed opportunity because he would have been more fun if his role had been written to allow him to play his part a bit more broadly.Let's review: Blow Dry is all wet. It combs over comedic opportunities in favor of immersing itself in a run through of tangled subplots which dulls much of the potential luster and glow the film's gimmick and performances might have had. In short, it's a pleasant but very modest film that offers absolutely nothing to get the least bit excited about except as an opportunity to see an impressive cast.The DVD looks pretty good over all visually and audio wise the main complaint is that some of the fun music cues are mixed too low. The only notable extra is a brief 7 minute behind the scene featurette which is both promotional and informative. It covers the bases in the expected manner and includes brief comments from one of the producers Sydney Pollack.If you watch Blow Dry without expectations and don't want to think too much, it's an enjoyable film with some decent performances, several overly familiar story lines and a nice gimmick (the hair dressing competition). The film's tone is bittersweet as well as comedic and it misses several opportunities for humor making it a light, warmhearted forgettable little truffle of a film. The DVD is pretty bare bones but for those interested in the cast it might be worth a rental.Christopher J. Jarmick is the co-author (WITH Serena F. Holder) of the criticaly praised suspense thriller THE GLASS COCOON.",N/A

Anyway, Mike Brody (older of the two sons, this time portrayed by Dennis Quaid) is now a marine biologist working at Sea World alongside his girlfriend, Catherine (played by the very beautiful Bess Armstrong).  Sean Brody (younger of the two sons) decides to come visit Mike and Catherine and, with a little help from park water skier Kelly, attempts to conquer his childhood fear of the water.  However, Sean's fears are soon realized as a giant, blood-thirsty great white shark makes its way into the park and begins feeding on its hapless patrons.  Eventually, things are brought to a rather &quot;explosive&quot; conclusion when Mike &quot;pulls the pin&quot; from a grenade that's been lodged in the shark's mouth.The things that really make this film work are the above average acting by an excellent cast, Alan Parker's exciting score (which actually does rival John Williams' original), and a very clever script written by Carl Gottlieb.  Another factor that makes the film so entertaining is simply the fact that it takes place at Sea World.Granted the special effects aren't what they were in the first two films, but they're certainly not bad and are much better than those featured in &quot;JAWS: The Revenge&quot;, the next film in the series.",N/A

484454,"What can I say the cover art of the DVD sucked me in and I bought it.  Well I was expecting a lot from the story line, because of the outside cover, but you should not judge anything by what is on the outside.  What was inside was definitely far different from what I perceived it to possibly have in it.  The plot line was disjointed, but very intriguing, though the messiah image is a bit cliqued, even though it works superbly into this movie.  The messiah plot did have some of its own quirks in this movie that are fairly original.  The whole mood and tone of the movie was oppressing and brooding, the animation surely made a proper set-up for the end of the world.  The characters were excellent, the ones that actually spoke and did not die randomly, especially Fuuma and Kamui.  The visuals were remarkable, definitely better than most animation out there.  The ending was kind of drawn out with a quick conclusion, and a time of mourning.  This is one of the most depressing animes I have seen, even more so than Akira, or the finale of Cowboy Bebop.  Well cheer for the Dragon of Heaven, but weep for the Dragon of Earth and watch something funny after this movie, because it really is depressing.  One complaint, like recent movies, notably Blood, this movie is too short what is the deal extend the movie so we can see some more character development.

46849,"&quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; is a wholly artificial film, dealing with wholly artificial people, amidst wholly artificial surroundings.  Like  &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; with gothic Russia before it, &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; takes the simple idea of old Spain during carnival, and exaggerates it into a fantastic world choking itself with an impossible amount of streamers, confetti, and grotesquely constumed revelers.  Essentially to Spanish to possibly be Spanish, the atmosphere created gives a richly textured visual feel. It becomes a costume as garish as those the Spanish people wear, disguising a series of complex and controversial themes, which could never be used as open plot devices. Director Josef von Sternberg is obviously aware of the conventions and restraints set up by Hollywood, twisting them to his own good.  Using the illusion of a typical Hollywood story, he thinly but potently veils these visual costumes, which in themselves hide his rich themes, creating a film so layered its staggering!At the center of all this is a Dietrich so beautiful, it is not quite possible to believe she ever existed outside this fantastic world created for her.  Impeccably lighted, and costumed in the most flamboyant trappings imaginable, she is a toyingly evil creature of film, more alive than ever.  Is it any wonder her character ruins so many men, on film alone you could fall in love with her?!&quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; is a completely visual film.  It's themes and ideas do not come from what you hear, but what you see.  The plot, which seems to hide them, is really needed only that these themes and visuals may gradually reach you.  I think, essentially, that story for Sternberg was like the cherry flavor in cough medicine, designed only to help you swallow the truly important stuff.  Perhaps we may never reach the center of a film like &quot;The Devil is a Woman.&quot;  If we did would we find the key to everything, or merely emptiness?",The Devil Is a Woman VHS

Teacher Pan does not have e-mail, DVD players, or the wonderful Sony Play Station II.  However, Teacher Pan does have determination, grit, and honor.As a new student of Kung Fu, known as wushu in China, I am beginning to realize the validity of the message portrayed in &quot;Iron and Silk.&quot;  The message that Kung Fu is not just a martial art but a way of life.  As Teacher Pan says, &quot;Do every move as if it were your last.&quot;  How often do we spend days, if not weeks, wasting our time with activities we truly do not care about? Probably far too many.One of my favorite parts of the movie deals with Teacher Pan trying to learn English.

412825,"&quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; is, I'd have to say, the most under-rated of the Halloween films.  It gets it's bad reputation because it's the only film in the series that does not feature Michael Myers prominently (he is actually seen in the movie during a scene at a bar when a commercial for a broadcast of the original film comes on a T.V.).Basically, this one centers around a mysterious Halloween mask production company's plot to kill all the children in the United States by planting small metallic devices inside the rubber masks that, when worn by the children during a special T.V. broadcast on Halloween night, will cause them to die a rather gruesome death via the excretion of snakes and other creepy crawlies from inside their bodies.  It's up to a man and his female partner to unlock the company's sinister secrets and bring it their evil plans to a halt before it's too late.I know, sounds a little off-beat, but who cares.  For anyone who is willing to look past the absence of Michael Myers and appreciate this film for what it is, I highly recommend you watch this one.  It's not on T.V. that often, so you'll probably have to either rent it or buy it.If you're a die-hard fan of the series and don't have this in your video collection yet, I would encourage you to purchase it.  However, if you're only a moderate fan I'd say rent it first.Even if you're not a fan of the series but like horror/sci-fi films (this one has a little bit from both genres) in general, I definitely encourage you to give this one a shot.P.S. For those who still continue to wonder why Carpenter went this route for the third installment, the answer is simple.  When &quot;Halloween II&quot; came out critics constantly bashed the film by saying that it was too much like the first one.  Listening to the critics, John and the rest of the people behind &quot;III&quot; decided to make it a completely different film.  The moral to the story, if you get what you asked for and still aren't happy, just shut up.  Unfortunately, though, critics never seem to be able to shup up.",Halloween 3 - Season of the Witch VHS
689475,"This has been unjustly trashed, probably because it's earnest, warm, and gentle, something not usually valued by the ex-film-students who run the indie world.  So defy them and go see this touching gem of a tragicomedy.A lotta g's there.  Anyway,  the movie starts like this; Jay (as in Jennifer, played by Leelee Sobieski) is a self-centered Goth teen, perceptive in some ways, naive in others; you know, typical teenager.  Graduating from school, she needs a job to get her own place, and comes across Randall, a straightlaced but rather kind men's clothing store manager (Albert Brooks), who gives her a job.The movie goes from there.  I won't bother to describe the plot any further because A) it'd blow way too many jokes and B) it's not what you call stunningly original, which would matter if this weren't a character piece.  However, this movie isn't about what happens to Jay and &quot;R&quot;, as Jay dubs him, but how they cause and react to the events in it.The relationship is a bit more complicated than friendship; Jay becomes sexually interested in Randall, which some people have found pretty hard to swallow, or have used to dismiss this as another &quot;middle-aged guy wows young girl&quot; movie, a case of boomer ego.  Lay your fears to rest; this is a movie about a man and a girl entering a father-daughter relationship, not &quot;Autumn in New York.&quot;  I really feel sorry for people who got SO caught up in this aspect of the film that they missed its humor, or its heart.Don't think, however, that just because this movie is touching, it's afraid of going for a belly laugh.  The window dressing alone is worth the price of admission.  I can't emphasize this enough, this movie is FUNNY!The acting is great; Brooks and Sobieski, whether dealing with anger or trading one-liners, have sensational chemistry.  Carol Kane delivers an excellent character performance as Jay's hyper-perky mother, and Michael McKean is a riot as Jay's...imperceptive stepfather.  John Goodman has basically a cameo as Jay's hippie father, and he's funny, as always.Then there's Christine Lahti's direction.  The movie is told from Jay's viewpoint, and at the start, it's gently surreal, with good use made of computer special effects.  Lahti handles this with considerable sensitivity, not neglecting the visual aspects in favor of the actors.  She does quite a good job.This is a movie infused with warmth, heart, and bittersweetness.  It's good for a laugh, and good for a cry, and I heartily recommend it if you want either or both.",My First Mister

The special documentary material includes extensive footage from Powell's earlier film &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; as well as commentary by Thelma Schoonmaker (Powell's widow), Martin Scorcese, and a woman who was so moved by the film that she journeyed to the location.

If you read the book &quot;Reel Bad Arabs&quot; you'd know what I am talking about. The story of this movie could be not all that although it is still an interesting movie to be watched. But what makes this movie one of a kind is that it is the first time Hollywood gives up the stereotype against Arabs and Muslims. The story revolves around 13 warriors who goes to defend a North Kingdom and fight against daemons.

340100,"The premise actually is a very intriguing one for the &quot;classic horror genre,&quot; in that a well-respected doctor, apparently highly regarded for research and innovation that is vaguely left hanging, with a strong religious belief, is approached for healing... and has sufficient idealism to extend the healing arts even to Dracula! Of course, the viewer has no idea of how said doctor was known by Dracula and the Wolf Man, or how he conveniently has the Frankenstein monster on his property, and healing of one who has been dead (then un-dead) for centuries seems excessively ambitious, but the effect remains curiously poignant - the efforts of a man of science, sincerely good, who hopes to find cures for the mind and soul through healing metabolic processes. (That these monsters all had previously died in several feature films is irrelevant - that detail never stopped their reappearance before.)I'm sure I'm not alone (amongst Universal horror film buffs) in having always found Larry Talbot (Wolf Man) to be an extremely sympathetic character. (Remember &quot;The path you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own...&quot; from the original?) This film, in all honesty, is so poorly executed (in the literary sense, since the filmography is good for the genre), and the plot so patchy, largely from seeking to integrate several different and unrelated monster themes, that it is only for fans of the series. Yet it is a great pleasure to see the decent and innocent Larry Talbot cured!Much goes unexplained, of course, and the depiction of the doctor, quite moving in the beginning, is dreadful when, in a puzzling move, a bit of Dracula's blood turns him into (not a vampire but) a mad scientist seeking to kill. The Frankenstein monster would have been well left out, since he plays no real part in anything but the poor ending.Still, it is fun, and just seeing the wolf man restored to health is worth an annual viewing.",N/A
523154,"I thought the movie was excellent, and I probably couldn't add anything new to what others have already said about it.  It is a well thought-out action movie (yes, it really is technically an action movie, as one would say Fugitive is an action movie) with great acting (particularly from Jaoquin Pheonix), add an honor theme, great scenes, and a thrilling plot, and you get a movie that feels like an epic and is a wee bit more than  an &quot;action movie.&quot;  As I'd say, and lots of Hong Kong movies realize this, action shouldn't feel like action more than an extension of character, which I think works here.  Movie sure seem to know how to make the Maximus character seem heroic. As for the DVD itself, I'd have to say this is a very excellently composed DVD.  It has lots of great extras such as extra videos and interviews and storyboards.  The audio and video quality is quite excellent.

413883,"The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, ""Trainspotting,"" directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a ""way of"" life, they have ""become"" his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to ""Rents"" the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to.  The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the ""filthiest toilet in Scotland.""  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go ""cold turkey.""  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.  McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not.  The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, ""Trainspotting"" will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable.  A great companion feature to the more recent ""Traffic,"" this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.",Trainspotting VHS

Fortunately, my fianc&eacute;e had seen Ghost in the Shell before and was able to explain it to me.The animation of Ghost in the Shell is fantastic. In a few places the scenery looks more like it has been filmed rather than drawn, and even the characters have movements that are fluid and graceful, instead of jerky and robotic, like some animated movies can have.The storyline of Ghost in the Shell is pretty straightforward, although the last 15 minutes or so was quite a surprise.  There's a lot of philosophy involved in the movie, mostly about what makes a person truly human, is it the ghost (a soul), or is it the fact we feel human.Ghost in the Shell was well done, and even though I'm not a huge fan of anime I enjoyed it quite a bit.",N/A

540352,"Unlike any other Steven Spielberg movie ever made, you are in for a shocking, mind-bending, often disturbing treatise on the nature of technology, and, perhaps more importantly, on humanity itself.  Much like 2001, and A Clockwork Orange, this movie is touched everywhere by Stanley Kubrick's brilliant hands; it is profoundly engaging, and hits horrifyingly close to home.  Set in a not-too-distant future, and without giving anything away, the movie begins as a couple decides to adopt the first robotic child programmed to love.  As a synopsis for all that follows, this in itself poses more questions that either Spielberg or Kubrick are prepared to answer.  The bottom line is this: the movie will infect your mind, and you will walk away from the theatre unable to shake the images, the emotional power, and the characters from your head.  Do not expect another summer blockbuster -- this movie is devoid of pure sensationalism, though it does feature two outrageously effective performances in Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law, and some of the most imaginative, realistic special effects you've ever seen.  Do not bring young children; even teens will be disturbed by the big questions this movie asks.  Like Kubrick's best films, this movie is a transporting work of science fiction that nearly begs to be seen more than once.  It is an entertainment, but one of the highest order: if you let yourself go there, you are transformed by the experience of seeing it, and some things may never look the same again.",N/A

467711,"I, like so many other people who grew up in the time I did, was first attracted to this film solely through the title song by Dr. Dre on the soundtrack to the film.  It was ridiculous how much I heard that song get played all over the radio and the hype it surrounded the movie with during that spring of 1992.  In fact, it, in many ways, has outlasted the film itself in terms of pop culture's memory.  And that is actually a shame.This a superior thriller, taking the undercover cop story and crafting a tension-drenched and surprisingly subtle movie.  And though it begins to lose its bottom by the end and becomes a little contrived, for the first three quarters of the movie it is expertise and a whole lot more unpredictable than most films of its genre.  Veteran actor Laurence Fishburne stars, in, surprisingly, his first lead role, as an L.A. cop who is assigned to go undercover and infiltrate a major cocaine empire in Los Angeles.  It is a job he reluctantly takes; as a child he witnessed his junkie father killed while pulling a stickup on Christmas Eve.  The flashback of this is shown as the opening scene and is one of the most disturbing in the film, as the young child, who had just listened to his father ask him what he wanted for Christmas, watches the whole bloody incident in horror and pain from the parked car.  This plays heavily on his conscience and his psychic well-being as the film goes on.  He goes everywhere from the seedy streets of the inner-cities and ghettos as a cocaine dealer and manages to get all the way to the highest ranks of the organization.  He does this by working his way into the circle of a mid-level drug distributor.  A supposedly clean-shaven man who owns a house, has a beautiful wife, and an eight-year-old daughter whom he practices the multiplication tables with in the morning.  This key character is played with nervous ingenuity by Jeff Goldblum, in one of his most impressive performances, and is the symbol of the disturbing depths that a man's greed can go to.All of this, while extremely strong assets, are more or less pretty routine in films such as these.  Director Bill Duke, however, manages to take it a step further and elevates this film with style and class.  He has Fishburne narrate the story and allows the langage to be poetic and colorful, something that derives from classic 1940s film noir.  My favorite line in the narration is on Fishburne's first day on the streets as a dealer when the voice-over says ""The great thing about life on the streets is you know how it's gonna be.  It's always the same.  It's always getting worse.""  The strongest and most potent scenes in the film are the ones dealing directly with Fishburne's struggles with the moral decisions he must make.  The ""deeper"" involved he gets in the criminal life, the more he begins to realize the cold and inhuman manner with which the government and authorities have been cast.  It's not that he decides he likes being a drug dealer, it's actually the exact opposite.  He becomes more and more determined to infiltrate the organization, by any means necessary, no matter how violent and chaotic it gets.  As I said, the film does begin to lose its bottom by the end, as the plot becomes slightly overblown, however, I won't go into details as it would spoil some surprises.  And overall the courage and conviction of the performances causes you to forget the lackluster final quarter.  Roger Ebert said that this was ""a drama disguised as a thriller"" and I will have to agree with that statement.  It is much more dependent on characters than on action scenes, and that is what makes it so much better and more intelligent that most of its genre.  Everywhere in this film there is the unmistakeable look and feel of the early '90s, whether it's in the great soundtrack, the sharp cinematography, the fast-paced editing and camera movements, or the screen sweeps that segue from scene to scene.  It was a good time in movies and music, if you ask me, but this film has aged much better than its closest companion 'New Jack City' has.  Possibly one of the most overlooked cop films of the '90s.",N/A
191583,"I'm not a western-movie-watching kind of girl, generally speaking.  One of my friends said this was his very favorite movie, though, that he cries every time he watches it.  So I gave it to him, and when he'd watched it again, I borrowed it.  And even though it's not my style, I really enjoyed it.  It has a wonderful pace, for one thing.  For the first little while I thought I was bored, but then I looked at the clock and I'd been watching for much longer than I would have guessed.I suppose you could call it a lot of kinds of story -- it's a story of friendship, it's got your basic cowboys and indians stuff going, it's just got some of every kind of western movie plot I can think of -- but for me one of the central things is that it's about all the different ways people can be good.  All the characters aren't good; in fact there are some pretty awful ones, but there's a lot of goodness in a lot of the people in this movie.  It just comes out in different ways in each of them.  That's a pretty powerful point to make.",N/A
39775,"&quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; surely must rank as one of the finest American movies ever made. It is one of my favorite holiday movies during the Christmas season, and certainly the one with the best acting. Jimmy Stewart is absolutely incredible as George Bailey, whose unlikely encounter with an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) allows Bailey to see how he's helped so many of his neighbors. Essentially, this film is a warm-hearted version of Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, replete with much American optimism. It's also a subtle cinematic ode to friendship, family and faith. Aside from Travers, the supporting cast, including Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore, is superb. Without a doubt it's a popular film during Christmas that ought to be required viewing throughout the year.",N/A
562791,"How typical of fanboys... one of the first things I noticed when reading the reviews were the comments on &quot;not enough fighting as the first disc&quot; or &quot;I expected more fights&quot; etc., etc ( Heaven forbid the same people watch the Patlabor movies ) . I guess when one ignores the great pacing, the vivid imagery, and the tasteful cinematography of the third episode one would consider it &quot;slow&quot;. But what the last two installment does is create a believable situation to the tragic and heart-rending tragedy of Himura. There is a noticeable introduction of CG elements in here, but it comes across as akward, especially with the melding of real-time sea-water and animated cels. Thankfully, this process is only done briefly, and does not hamper the overall visuial feel of series. The animation is solid, and the combat scenes of the last episode are so good that one can almost forgive the overtly violent scenes from the last two. And sorry, but just 'cuz there are swords and samurai in here doesn't necessarily mean that a Kurosawa comparison is in order.

485687,"Another superb DVD has just been released by Anchor Bay : Robert Aldrich's THE GRISSOM GANG, adapted from James Hadley Chase's &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot;. Excellent movie but only the choice between the standard and the widescreen version and a scene access as bonus features. Extra meager. Sound and images more than OK for me.Robert Aldrich is more known as a successful director of action movies like THE DIRTY DOZEN than as a sensitive observer of psychological dramas but with THE KILLING OF SISTER GEORGE, released in 1968 and THE GRISSOM GANG, Big Bob showed that a golden heart was beating under his elephant skin.Don't get me wrong ! THE GRISSOM GANG is also a gangster movies loaded with machine guns duels and vicious killings but what's more interesting is the description of the relationship between Slim, the psychotic killer, and Barbara Blandish, the spoiled heiress. This unusual couple has to face a collection of secondary characters one will not forget so easily. For instance, Ma Grissom, played by Irene Dailey, a criminal genius and an overprotective mother, or Eddie - Tony Musante - Hagan, the archetype of the gangster of the 30's, so seductive but ready to kill anything that moves, even women, if necessary.In the good guys section of the movie, there is someone who, in spite of his millions, could have been part of the Grissom gang : Wesley Addy, Barbara's father and often present in Aldrich's films, his attitude is one of the most disturbing seen in a movie.All in all, an excellent addition to your library.A DVD zone Bonnie and Clyde.",N/A

530277,"'Lost Souls' makes an effort to be a film that ranks up there with 'The Exorcist' but it doesn't quite succeed.  I agree with the majority of the reviews posted here regarding the spectacular cinematography.  The director manages to create an dark atmosphere that literally screams suspense.  However, this does not compensate for the weak, unoriginal storyline and sub-par performances by some of the actors.  Wynonna Ryder's performance in particular, is flat and downright unbelievable.  She fails to inject any real emotion or drama in her performance whatsoever, which seriously damages the film.  We don't view her as the unlikely hero, the saviour of mankind, just as an annoyance whose whole approach is 'ho hum, been there, done that'.  Ben Chaplin is equally middle-of-the-road in his performance, although I think he did what he could with what he was given.  They tried to focus on creating a sympathetic and likable character, but he and Ryder have NO on-screen chemistry, which certainly didn't help.  You end up waiting for some big thing that never happens (well, until the end). John Hurt manages to steal most of the scenes that he is in...and even manages to out-act Ryder when he is supposed to be in a coma (what does THAT tell you).It was a extremely good move to keep the so-called exorcisms reduced to distorted, half-seen segments, filled with screams of agony and terror.  This forced the viewer to rely on their imagination, as it is the unseen, the unknown, is usually what provokes the most fear.  For example, take the first 'Alien'  'Halloween', 'Psycho', or 'Nightmare on Elm Street' for example. You never really got a good look at that alien, Michael Meyers, Norman's Mother or Freddy Kruger in the original version of any of these films.  That's what made it so damn scary as our childhood fear of the dark or the boogeyman, were justified time and again.  This was one of the few redeeming qualities of the film because when film-makers rely on in-your-face tactics, it usually ends up just being unrealistic and cheesy special effects.  However,this film tends to take itself too seriously in its efforts to make it a new twist on an old story, and frankly, it just doesn't cut it.  It relies on the same old religious references and 'evil' icons.  The cinematography and the surprise ending are really the only thing that make this film worth watching.  Rent it first, you'd have to be a pretty serious fan of this genre or Ryder or whoever to find it worthy of a purchase.",N/A
120288,"Any Given Sunday feels longer than it's 151 minutes, mainly because it tries to cram too much in. Oliver Stone is a fine movie director although his recent offerings have been paltry, including this one. The violent and break-neck on-field action is captured perfectly. The problem lies within the movie's insipid two-dimensional characters. Al Pacino brings a wearied cynicism to his role as Coach D'Amato and is excellent as usual. The only other credible characters are a cocky halfback played by professional rapper LL Cool J, and Matthew Modine as a conscienious team doctor.The second disc of this 2-disc set features screen tests, including a home video of Jamie Foxx tossing a football in a park. It also features a 'making of' plus there are deleted scenes with commentary by Oliver Stone. If you enjoyed the movie, I definitely recommend this movie for purchase for it's superb extras.Many will find this movie slow-moving despite the football action, though. It's standard fare as far as football films go. There is nothing here that hasn't been done already which leads one to re-think the whole football film genre.Unless you are a football fan, stay well away.",N/A
33878,"I rarely buy movies. But I did buy American History X.This is the incredibly powerful story of two brothers who fall into the trap of racism and hate. It is also the story of these brothers trying to free themselves from racism and hate. After spending some time in prison for murdering two blacks who try and steal his car (a dispute starting with a basketball game), former neo-nazi Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) leaves his incarceration a changed man. To his dismay, however, he find that his younger brother is walking the same path he once did. The movie uses black-and-white scenes from the past in conjunction with color scenes in the current situation to establish Derek's sordid history as a vicious racist and show his path to change.The younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), idolizes Derek. In fact, the local coterie of skinheads all do. Derek has a power to feed the hate of his retinue with fiery rhetoric that targets ethnic groups indiscriminately with intense indignation. The movie is truly scary when you see the skinheads bonding, brought together by an irrational hate and Derek's ability to gratify it with his fierce oratories.Edward Norton was robbed when the Academy denied him the Oscar for Best Actor (he was nominated, though). His performance is compelling and real...frighteningly so. He effectively straddles the line between a smart kid with dumb ideas and the true racist seething with hate. I sincerely think he is one of Hollywood's most promising actors. Edward Furlong is also powerful, which is shocking for an actor of his age. Danny shares Derek's hate, but not the ability to convey it &quot;rationally.&quot; The script is stunning, likewise the directing and editing.The movie is violent and brutal, almost disturbingly so, but it is critical to underscore the power of the story. This is not tasteless killing. And it does not glorify racism...it exposes the consequences of racism and its absurdity. It shows how screwed-up people can rise above the pettiness of hate. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is when Derek and Danny pull down all the Nazi crap on his bedroom wall.This movie is intense, as well. I must have lost 20 pounds watching it, because my heart was pounding insanely hard. The ending is horrifyingly sad...I have to wonder if I've ever been more moved by a movie.Be warned: It's brutal, gritty, and emotionally heavy. But at the same time it's a remarkably powerful story with first-rate acting and a powerful message. Don't pass this one up.",N/A
251897,"&quot;Say Anything&quot; pinpoints a different kind of 80s love story movie, with less ridiculous attempts at comedy and more of a meaningfull plot. John Cusack spent most of the 80s spinning out classic teenaged comedy, but cuts down on the often needless immature and spastic humor in this movie. His trademark I think is his nervous and eager personality as the classic underachiever. Playing C student Lloyd Dobbler about to graduate from high school, he falls helplessly in love with the shy and lacking of self-esteem validictorian Diane Cort, played by Ione Skye. Lloyd lives with his sister Constance, a single mother and an un-credited part played by John's sister Joan Cusack, and focuses his life around kick-boxing. Lloyd and Diane wind up falling in love despite their differences, but are torn apart by the legal troubles of Diane's father, played excellently by John Mahoney. The movie centers around Cusack's determination to hold on to his relationship with Skye, doing everything it takes for them to stay together. The performances and original storyline are what make &quot;Say Anything&quot; great, and the movie is full of scenes that will never die. Scenes like Cusack holding a radio above his head outside Skye's bedroom window one night playing &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; by Peter Gabriel. No one by John Cusack could've done something better and more effective in a film. &quot;Say Anything&quot; in my mind is a new classic, a movie worth having when the box office keeps pucking up the same romantic attempt at garbage every year, I give the movie 5 stars.",Say Anything VHS

As far as &quot;making a statement,&quot; I give it no stars, but for entertainment value, it's a five-star treat.

372835,"For many years, I have considered Leonardo Da Vinci to be the most talented person who ever lived and this series of videos reinforces that belief. While the dialog and many circumstances are based on little more than conjecture, the story does give you an indication of the amazing talent that was loaded into just one man. Since it has been reproduced so many times, it easy to forget that ""The Last Supper"" covers an entire wall. The magnitude and detail of the painting are even more impressive when you understand that. It also increases your disgust when you realize how it has been treated down through the centuries.His talents as a thinker, inventor and engineer are just as impressive. Many of his ""inventions"" were centuries ahead of their time, anticipating many devices such as the submarine and tank. While none were actually constructed, many of the design principles were sound and it took many people to regenerate his revolutionary ideas.The tapes also give you detailed insight into the political and economic structure of southern Europe at that time. Northern Italy was the center of the Renaissance, and the city states were economically powerful but militarily weak nations. Ruled by wealthy people who would not have had that kind of political power in earlier centuries, that wealth was spent in the support of court artists so that they could create works to enhance the prestige of the rulers. While this placed substantial resources at the disposal of the artist, it also made them subject to the fickle political winds that were constantly blowing across northern Italy.His service to deposed rulers made him politically suspect and he was forced to relocate several times during his life. I had never realized that the famous Mona Lisa had been moved so many times. One can only speculate on what his accomplishments would have been had his travels been reduced. It was also new to me that he was once brought up on anonymous charges of heresy, which could have led to his being executed as a heretic.One of the greatest artists of all time, Leonardo was also one of the great observers, seeing many things that no one else did. Using these observations as a model, he cataloged and invented many things that were centuries ahead of their time. Had he completed it, his books on human anatomy and painting would no doubt still be in use. Leonardo Da Vinci could have achieved a significant place in history in many different areas, together they make him the most talented of all time and these tapes will help you understand the man and the world he lived in. I was amazed, impressed and humbled when I watched them.",Life of Leonardo Da Vinci 3pc  VHS
243075,"Finally ...... one of those DVD re-releases I've been practically holding my breath for, and was not disappointed.  This criminally overlooked gem was trashed by critics upon its release in 1970, and never enjoyed a video transfer worthy of the filmmaker's effort, not even on laserdisc!  And as you can see from the varying reviews, the controversy rages on.  Which just proves how alive and well and timely a film Catch-22 truly is.Mike Nichols captures the essence of Joseph Heller's defining anti-war classic quite admirably, with a faithful adaptation by Buck Henry (who can be seen along with a veritable Who's Who period ensemble cast), with an eye as removed and objective as Kubrick, yet at times very visually subjective ..... an approach used to great advantage in his previous hit film The Graduate.  All the verbal and ethical contradictions of the book bring its dark humor to demented life, through a kaleidoscopic cavalcade of archtypical characters who make up the living nightmare of one Captain Yossarian, who has decided he can no longer bear to fly the combat missions his superiors have made it impossible to get out of.  To get out of flying, he has to be officially diagnosed as &quot;crazy&quot;, and must request to be grounded ..... but if he requests to be grounded, then he's not really crazy, and is therefore eligible to keep flying missions.  That's some catch, that Catch-22.This film, like the book on which it's based, is not so much an indictment of the insanity of war as it is a look at how the corporate mentality can find its way into the noblest of causes, and how beurocratic manipulations devaluate basic human principles, which take a back seat to merely &quot;looking good&quot;.  A timeless theme indeed.  This skewed logic is cheerfully accepted by all the story's characters ..... until our Yossarian's eyes are opened to the product of that logic literally disemboweled at his fingertips (yes, that scene was put back in!), and suddenly he is the outsider whose prime mission is to avoid any more missions.  Which is not an easy thing to do when Brass keeps adding more after you've completed your tour of duty.As far as the transfer itself:  It has probably never looked better since the original theatrical release over 30 years ago, especially being the first widescreen release of this title, which is the only way to experience it as intended.  The transfer team did the best they could with the mono soundtrack, I'm sure, which does get compressed and distorted at times, something we enthusiasts of early films live with.Mike Nichols' Catch-22 may only enjoy cult status, but it is DVD releases like this (and that other oddball, star-studded 60's curiosity Candy) that make one truly appreciate what is being done with this revolutionary medium.  Hey, not all movies can be for everybody.  Long live the Anti-Blockbusters!",N/A
529999,"I decided to rent &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; from a recomendation from one of my freinds. And it turned out to be a very entertaing, freshing departure from the norm of most comedy's. Here's something i could sort of relate to...well not entirly. But i could sort of undertsand where this guy is coming from. Meets the parents of your love one for the first time, it could be quit tough, i mean trying to impress them, showing them that your willing to go out of their way for their daughter , that you really deserve her. And while trying to do such a thing can be quit troublesome, ..Trust me, i know...boy do I know. And alot what you try to get across comes out the wrong way, not the way you intended. It's either how you come across to the folks, how you talk, how smart you are, your likes, your dislikes, how willing you are, coming up with one single converstation that won't fall flat in the last 2 minutes. And as much as you try, you could never get where you want to go. This could be just as depressing when it comes to acutally talking and trying to impress a girl in general, a girl that seems to like you, but in a way doesn't. Your confused , you don't know what to think, your verbal comunication with her,...can be alot better than it is. The trouble is that you don't know how to fully open up around her. Sure your a nut-ball when it comes being around your best buds. But when your around her, everything is different. Theres a simple joy of seeing her happy, seeing that cute smile of hers'. You try and you try, and from day to day it seems less sucessful, you look back at the days when your did thought were impresing her, and say to yourself.&quot;Maybe I should just give up..&quot; Then your realize it wasn't their doing,..but yours. It's your disadvantage of being who you are. Your shy, your not very good at making conversation, and you then blame it all on yourself. And when that happens depression kicks into full gear. You find yourself doing things that you wouldn't normally do, walking the town for no reason, just collecting your thoughts, as you sip a cold beer. Life can be cruel, but you know what, you are your own worst enemy. Time goes on, and after a while and you don't know what to think. All of this is what this movie represents, while I was watching this, I really felt bad for the guy, but it made me think on how pointless and unmeaningful my life really is. Here is a guy who in the end really suceeded, who acutally made it to FIRST base. This is one of the main reasons what made this movie so charming. And in the end I really felt for them , and i was really happy for the couple. Becasue I was seeing something that will never happen to me, something I yern for. Something that I wish for, with this girl that i really love. There's all these conflicting images, and symbols, one of them being the ex-boyfreind, the competion, the struggle. In my case the boyfriend that has her, and doesn't seem to let her go. But in the end the ex-boyfreind winds up being greatful, forgiving, happy for his new rival. That he is lucky enough to have such a great girl, I tend to feel the same way at times, I think , well as long as she is happy, i'll be happy. And you want to tell her boyfreind that he is the luckyiest SOB on the planet, and he is. This movie is both touching, and flat-out Hilarious. This film is just as much a comedy as it is a Love Satire, and it's a winner in both areas. The peformances are wonderful, Robert De Niro never fails to impress me, one of the greatest dramatic actors who ever lived, and what a shame it would be, when he finnally leaves us, something I would never hope for. And Ben Stillar is just fine as the new forth-coming son-in-law, who brings and air of forgiveness and warmth to it all.

350533,"Some people seem to think &quot;L'Avventura&quot; is Antonioni's first 'Great' film. No Way! Antonioni was already up there with the all-time greats with his first two Fifties masterpieces &quot;Chronicle of a Love Affair&quot; and &quot;Le Amiche,&quot; (Glad to say &quot;Le Amiche&quot; is now available in a very good transfer on IMAGE DVD with removeable subtitles in all its rapid-fire Italian dialogue glory which you can freeze and study at your own pace) although he didn't become quite the Revolutionary of Cinema until about the time of &quot;Il Grido (The Cry)&quot; which hinted at everything that soon crystalized on the magnificent trilogy of &quot;L'Avventura,&quot; &quot;La Notte,&quot; and &quot;The Eclipse,&quot; &amp; later even expanded into an almost romantic and transcendent view of the future (through individuation &amp; discarding of outdated myths and customs) in the vastly underrated artistic coup-d'etat of American cinema &amp; all of American commercial culture: the awesome post-Hippie tour-de-force &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; (a multi-million dollar commercial disaster that severely crippled Antonioni's later ability to raise financing).The superb ultra-dense and illuminating commentary on the first disc of Criterion's &quot;L'Avvenura&quot; by Gene Youngblood (author of the late '60s cinematic theory classic &quot;Expanded Cinema&quot;; for a different take on Antonioni, that goes even deeper than what Youngblood has to say on this disc without becoming didactic or pretentious in any 'film-or-art-school gibberish' way, you cannot do much better than William Arrowsmith's long essay in &quot;Antonioni: Poet of Images&quot;;), that alone, along with the pristine transfer of the film itself (only one negligable line in the final party scene which they've reduced to an absolute minimum) would easily be worth the price of 4 movie tickets.But you also get a second disc which doesn't have too much on it, but what it does have is fantastic: a rare 1 hour mid-'60s French documentary on Antonioni &amp; Jack Nicholson's passionate reading of 3 of Antonioni's most insightful essays (and later a recalling of a hilarious incident on the set of &quot;The Passenger&quot;).Now, for a superstar like Nicholson (who has never embarrassed himself as an artist or sold-out to the Hollywood mainstream despite a thousand and one opportunities &amp; made the producers of &quot;Batman&quot; pay points through the nose for agreeing to appear in that fluff piece) to take the time to pay his respects to a director he truly admires, and promote the sale of this DVD, should teach some of the younger generation of actors something (or even Robert De Niro, who has for many years now, it's pretty friggin' obvious, gone completely mainstream, and is busy doing DVD commentaries for awful pieces of unfunny, brain-dead commerical putritude like &quot;Meet the Parents,&quot; that didn't need his commentary to sell a zillion copies!)! The documentary is in Black and White and among other things which are of supreme interest for cineastes, are the rare interviews with Cesare Zavattini (one of the founders of Neo-Realism), Ennio Flaiano (Fellini's and Antonioni's co-writer), Giovanni Fusco (the Rolls Royce to Ennio Morricone's Ford Mustang in the Paisano hierarchy of film composers), Monica Vitti (at home, in the early '60s with Antonioni himself, who doesn't talk to the interviewer &amp; only throws in an occasional comment!), and Fellini (taking a break from filming &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; to talk to the enquiring interviewer about his friend &amp; co-writer on &quot;The White Sheik&quot;). There are some rare, very revealing shots of Antonioni directing films which give you a rough idea of his style of interaction with cast and crew (in one scene, he is shown directing Princess Soraya, the former wife of the Shah of Iran, whom the Shah had divorced for not having borne him a son!). Last but not least, we also get to see the ridiculously vulgar American trailer for &quot;L'Avventura&quot; that tries to sell it to 'high-class' American audiences as some kind of 'sophisticated' European sex-exploitation film by showing every 'provocative' little snippet in the entire film!",L'Avventura VHS
230698,"That's the way this film was advertised when it came out in 1981, in the classic Universal monster sense ""a monster movie.""  As a child of divorce, I had a weekend Dad that would take my sister and me to any movie regardless of rating (well, within limits) and this one scared us silly.  I remember sitting in the theater and watching the transformation (having seen Lon Chaney Jr.'s transformation in ""The Wolf Man"" I was familiar with the lineage of the genre and the example this film had to live up to... having seen ""The Howling"" later (not much later, as the films nearly competed with each other theatrically) I was a huge fan of Rob Bottin and his mentor, Rick Baker (not to mention the late, great Dick Smith and the master of splatter, Tom Savini), I was just glued to the screen during one of the coolest effects of all time, just awed by what was happening, and just freaked at the believability of it all when compared to the stop-motion transformation of the Chaney makeup) not to mention the scene with David Naughton (""be a Pepper! Drink Dr. Pepper!) and Jenny Agutter in bed (not to mention the shower)... yowza! (Well, I was 11).The only thing that's ever bugged me about this film is the lack of what's supposed to be a supremely gory scene that Landis cut out because it overwhelmed the scene that came after it (supposedly, audiences were so grossed out and shocked that they babbled through the entire dialogue scene that followed David waking up in the wolf's pen at the zoo): the scene was the expanded murders of the bums by the dock, and I don't think it makes it to this new DVD version of the film (which is a bummer, because the expanded gore in Verhoven's Robocop (Criterion edition) actually plays better than the MPAA approved version).In any case, this is a truly great ""monster movie"" in every sense of the word... it's gross, funny, sexy, exploitative in many ways (the book ""Splatter Movies"" calls it gore porn), truly a Landis film by dint of it's ""in"" jokes and orgy of automotive mayhem, and it offers great acting and casting (even in small roles like the Pakistani shift worker at the hospital and the punks on the London Underground).  Just an all-around fun movie, with truly amazing, and Oscar-winning effects (still looking awesome and believable... nothing digital comes close!!  I'll say it again: digital just ain't there yet... the transformation looks bone crunching, painful, horrific, and stretches the imagination in more ways than one).  Bottom line, I've waited for this damn DVD forever... the first edition DVD was slop and went out of print so fast, I was lucky to find a video store copy to rent.  No extras on that one... but this one is the one to own.",N/A

I frankly don't know where to start with,,  The story itself is pretty interesting;a british boy, who lives in this small coal mining town with intensified strikes going on, happens to find his hidden talent as a ballet dancer.It is a very powerful movie because it gives out this inspiration, motivation, little push to change your life if you are caught up with the situation/circumstances.  I'm not joking here, but I literally packed all of my video games and systems (which happen to be my precious collection over years) to sell them and move on to be a determined law school student,,(which ended up in unpacking everything i've packed..it was so close though,,).  I mean, I could never ever picture myself throwing away my precious game collections, but this movie actually persuaded me to throw them away to dance for my own dream, almost.  This movie shows a burning desire of a boy, (hold it right there!) you see, do you know what it feels like to have that burning desire? that you wanna do something so bad yet you are strained by your own family,,  This movie did an excellent job on building/developing the struggle by Billy with the family, outside, and himself.  man,, this boy surely knows how to dance,,let me tell you that-  (I'm seriously considering of registering a dance class, though i'm not much of a dancer)I absolutely agree with the other reviewer who said that this movie was overlooked during Oscar ceremony.  I don't know about you, but i couldn't understand why the Billy Elliot wasn't picked as a best movie, well at least it's better than Gladiator.  This already maginificient movie with struggling, dancing, maturing boy, is again solidified with the father's decision to sacrifice himself utterly, i mean utterly and vague touch of Billy's gay friend, who adds more to the depth of the story with this faint scent of nostalgia.Aaahh(sigh),, I literally watched his dancing scenes more than,, i don't even remember,,  But this boy, who wants to be a ballet dancer, will either make you cry with tears of determination or give that warmth that you haven't felt for a long time.Hey people, dance like Billy, dance like Billy to go forth to reach for your dream regardless of the struggle, obstacle, and circumstances,, if Billy can do it, then you and I can do it  =)",N/A

283872,"I love this movie.  I thought POLTERGEIST III was a pretty good end to the trilogy.  So what if they went low budget this time?  It still turned out pretty good.  The only complaint I have is the lack of Jerry Goldsmith's original score.  Jerry Goldsmith is a big-budget composer, but this was a low budget movie, so Joe Renzetti (1988's CHILD'S PLAY) was called in.  The least he could have done was reprise &quot;Carol Anne's Theme&quot;.  However, there is a sweet 2nd theme for Carol Anne at the end, so I guess that is a farily well make-up.The reason why Scott was missing at the end is because they had to re shoot the end.  The girl in Nancy Allen's arms wasn't even Heather O'Rourke, due to the young actress' death.  The cast and crew wasn't exactly in the best mood, because of this.  They just re-shot the ending and did not even give a second thought to Scott.  It was just too depressing.  Let's just say that he ended up back with his family.To sum this movie up, it is basically the same thing as the first two, same formula.  Just replace Steve &amp; Diane (Craig T. Nelson &amp; JoBeth Williams) with Pat &amp; Bruce (Nancy Allen &amp; Tom Skerritt), replace the suburban neighborhood of Questa Verde with the urban city of Chicago, and replace upbeat orchestral music with more subtle electronics, and you've got POLTERGEIST III!In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie for you if you liked the first 2.  It may seem very different due to the lack of the things mentioned above, but is still a very fun film to watch.  There is no better end to this wonderful trilogy!This review is dedicated to the memory of Heather O'Rourke:(1975-1988)",N/A

460653,"Few animated films can be comfortablly labeled &quot;important&quot;.  Mamoru Shinzaki's &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; is, without a doubt, one of these films.  Based on Keiji Nakazawa's poignant graphic novel, the film tells the story of a family and how their lives are affected by the atomic bomb dropped on Hisroshima in 1945.  Shinzaki perfectly adapts Nakazawa's somewhat akward style of drawing and adds dimension to these already strong characterizations.  The animation is a bit on the stiff side.  The style of animation looks a bit like what we stereotypically think of when picturing anime.  While there are moments of great beauty and grace (mostly in the film's backgrounds), the animation is closer to Speed Racer than Princess Mononoke.  The film elegantly re-tells Gen's tragic story of survival, streamlining the narative for the big screen.  Missing from the film are several charming vignettes as well as two of Gen's brothers.  Focusing mainly on Gen and his actions and responses, the film loses some of the comic's political vigor but retains a strong voice against war.  Never is the film anti-American.  It matter of factly cries out against the pointlessness of war.  It is mainly through the horrors witnessed in uncompromising graphic detail (even more so in the comic) that this message is most vivid.  And yet Barefoot Gen is ultimately a story of survival.  Gen is a hero and his actions speak of the amazing potential of the human spirit when faced with the unspeakable.  The only thing you will be longing for after the film's somber closing is more.  Like &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;, &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; is more than worthy of a spot in any collector's library.",N/A
571789,"I just finished watching this movie for the second time, and it still wowed me. The wacky, off-beat script is handled perfectly by an outstanding cast, and one cannot help but be drawn into Nurse Betty's touching journey to find another, only, in the end, to find herself.I sat in awe of the superb performance given by Renee Zellweger. The movie is worth buying just to see what a fine actress can do with a challenging role. Wisely, the director gives her the camera, and the results are magnificent.Sincere and balanced performances by the entire cast make ""Nurse Betty"" a fine example of ensemble acting at its best.I greatly admire Morgan Freeman, and he, as usual, gives a wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear is also to be commended for the absolute mastery of his character. His work with Renee Zellweger is of the highest calibar.I was particularly moved by the scene in the car when Renee Zellweger talks with Greg Kinnear about a day she spent with her mother - what a wonderful moment of superb acting.I was also impressed by the fine use of music in the film to help create mood.This is a movie not everyone will like, but I think it will hold a special place in the hearts of those it touches. The only negative thing I can say about the movie is the needless use of profanity. It added nothing to the film, and hurt a lovely script. Bravo, for ""Nurse Betty."" Thanks for a great movie.",N/A

178152,"This Gun for Hire was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale and was considerably toned down and glammed up for the early 40s movie going public. Not that there's anything wrong with that.I found this movie rather enjoyable, it is easy to see why Ladd and Lake were made into a screen team. They are supported by Laird Cregar as a plotting spy with no stomach for violence and Robert Preston as Veronica Lake's cop boyfriend. Alan Ladd steals the show as Raven, a killer for hire who really only likes cats. (as a cat lover, I was automatically more sympathetic to him) Cregar's Gates betrayed him to the cops and now he wants revenge.Raven and Lake's Ellen, a nightclub magician, cross paths throughout the movie and she begins to strip down his tough guy veneer to reveal an abused childhood. Armed with her brains and a considerable amount of flag waving, Ellen tries to persuade Raven to give up his vengeance and uncover an Axis plot.Ladd, Lake and Cregar are all marvelous but the usually wonderful Preston (best known for his smooth con-man in Music Man) isn't given much to work with and his cop character feels flat especially next to Raven.This movie is really a must-see for any fan of 40's films and even with its flaws (I also found the final image to be annoying and totally against Lake's independant character), it is still a pleasant way to pass an evening.",N/A

Though the case, Christie's first published mystery, isn't one of her most baffling (go to THE ABC MURDERS also available on DVD for that), it is certainly full of the author's well-known devices: a murder by poisoning (Christie was a poison expert having worked in a dispensery during World War I), a suitable cast of suspects who we inevitably learn all had reason enough for wanting the victim dead, and the studied investigation by our Belgian sleuth with the usual endearing incompetence of his friend Arthur Hastings.These BBC adaptations are beautifully made, faithful in their period touches (though, of course, Hastings and Poirot don't look any younger here than in their later adventures which take place at least ten to fifteen years later), and the casting as always couldn't be better.Though lacking much in the way of supplements (the information on Agatha Christie and David Suchet is repeated on each disc in the series), the clarity of the picture and clear sound (alas mono) make owning these DVDs a must for mystery lovers.",N/A

276565,"Conventional opinion in the realm of Marx mania targets this movie as inferior. It is ironic that top-of-the-line MGM was partly responsible for diminishing the later Marx magic by teaming silly scripts and moronic musical numbers with the lunacy of the Marx screen persona. This tone-deaf creative acumen relegated Messrs. Marx to lesser material in their last three films at the studio. Take courage; not all is lost. Looking past the annoyances of Kenny Baker's unfortunate singing and the goofy dancing horse number, we can see Marxian mirth in good health. Groucho, without an ID badge, tries to board the circus train guarded by Chico, and we are off to more classic comedy. As Groucho and the guys try to obtain an incriminating cigar from a thieving midget, Marx mayhem prevails. The spirited performance of ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"" is also a definite plus. Harpo struggles, at times, to find something relevant to do. His pantomime antics do not always make sense within the! context of the action. However, Harpo's mischievous elfin qualities sparkle as he and Chico search the sleeping strongman's room for the missing money. Despite a bias against intrusive musical numbers..., Harpo connects with the singing and dancing African-American kids in a way that illustrates that his otherworldy perspective truly transcends mere racial barriers. His harp solo punctuates this segment nicely. Margaret Dumont is again on hand as the hilarious target of Groucho's barbed zingers. Even with its faults, this is an enjoyable Marx Brothers jolt for fans of classic comedy. Fast forwarding through the dull spots makes multiple viewing a treat. ;-)",N/A

676249,"The ghost of John Newman Edwards must have had a hand in writing the script. The movie is pure legend, with not a shred of history allowed to intrude. I liked it. It worked because they didn't try to play it too seriously. This was the flaw in the Rob Lowe/Bill Paxton movie &quot;Frank and Jesse&quot;--they tried to make us take their hopeless mangling of history seriously.&quot;American Outlaws&quot; played it for fun, adventure, and legend. It covers only a single year time span during which time they seem to have robbed every bank in Missouri. Busy boys. The gang was also a sensitive, nurturing gang to the lesser-known members (funny scene).I can't possibly list all the diversions from actual history they made as they barely ever drifted even close to reality. Cole Younger would have hated the movie--they had him portrayed as the dumb guy. Frank was the smart one, and Jesse, of course, was the cute, dangerous one. The Irish guy who played Jesse did a good job. He didn't sound like he was trying to overcome an Irish accent, did a good, flat American, but he didn't really sound like anyone from Missouri either. He almost miraculously managed to always have that ever-so-manly two-day growth of beard ala Miami Vice.The setting was the film's biggest weakness--it looked much more like California than Missouri. Way too brown and dry, wrong kinds of trees. The town of Liberty looked like a generic Hollywood western town set, not at all right.So, I recommend &quot;American Outlaws&quot; as a fun action movie, _not_ as history. They did use the perils to returning Rebels pretty well at first but soon lost that to the whole purely fictional railroad plotline. Don't expect anything like &quot;Ride With the Devil&quot; out of this (though there is a nifty battle scene at the beginning).",N/A
532436,"Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with ""The Sixth Sense"", but he outdid himself with ""Unbreakable"", a film I liked even better.  This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.  The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.  The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.The direction is superb in every aspect.  The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.  Though some have complained about the pace of the film, I found it to be necessarily deliberate, avoiding the temptation to rush through the psychological elements and heightening the suspense.  The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.Bruce Willis can't seem to do a film lately without a kid to play opposite.  As was the case with ""Sixth Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film.  The scene where Clark confronts him with a loaded weapon will nail you to the wall.  Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.Samuel L. Jackson knows only one way to play a part and that is flat out.  Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.  Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"").  Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.For anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.  I rated it a 9/10.  It will keep you guessing and intrigued throughout.",Unbreakable

I'm not suprised that women haven't liked this movie very much, and I've concluded it is generally a movie for guys. It focuses on a turning point all men face, the transistion from early twenties to adulthood. In our culture, we often neglect questions of identity, and we typically indulge in consumerism as Ed Norton's character does in the beginning. Then comes along Tyler Dirden (Brad Pitt) who challenges Norton's life. Implicit in this is a string of doubts: I was a boy, then a teen, then young, now a man, and that means? where did that go? why did it go? It is like a midlife crisis 10 or 15 years too soon. This movie tries to reinforce that it is better to establish identity than to worry about other people's perceptions. Indeed, the characters go overboard on this, but I doubt most people will go that far. If people just look behind characters' motives and try to see the lingering doubts, the movie becomes far more intelligible and less of a macho bash.",N/A

388417,"I saw this movie because it featured one of my favorite actresses from the early '80s -- the lovely Diane Franklin who is probably best known for a better role in a better movie, Better Off Dead.  Here, Franklin is basically the only sympathetic character as she plays the sweetly virginal younger sister of a teenager who is eventually possessed by Satan and goes on a killing rampage in the house that would later become the setting of the Amityville Horror.  Anyway, as part of that whole possession deal, older brother decides to have an incestous relationship with younger sister and the fact that Franklin, an actress who deserved better, is so shamelessly exploited only serves to make this film even more sickening to sit through.  This is the most loathsome type of horror film -- i.e., the type of film that exists only to introduce a group of characters so that the audience can then get the thrill of watching them sadistically killed off.  That takes place in the first half of the film.  The second half is a blatant rip-off of the Exorcist and isn't any better.  Few other movie genres have the potential power of the horror film and a film like Amityville II serves only to remind us how great these films can be when done with some measure of talent and thought (the original Halloween, the Exorcist, the original Haunting of Hill House, and a few others come to immediate mind).  Still, anyone who enjoys watching little children graphically murdered and innocent girls raped by their brothers should find plenty to enjoy in this film.

295995,"Zoe Tamerlis (also known as Zoe Lund) died a few years back in Paris of an apparent drug overdose.  Even though she'd never be a household name, the actress had a cult following in the States -- largely as a result of her debut film, Abel Ferrara's violent Ms. 45.  Made when she was only seveteen, Ms. 45 stars Tamerlis as Thana, a young, mute woman who works in New York's garment district and spends her days suffering in forced silence as basically every male on the planet either propositions her or taunts her with sexist comments.  (One of the film's more disturbing aspects isn't that not a single positive man makes an appearance but that the male ogres who do show up are all so believable and familiar.)  One day, in a coincidence that points to the film's exploitation roots, Thana is raped twice by two different men in one day.  After the second rape, the mute Thana finally asserts her independence by killing her attacker and from there, the film's plot shifts into high gear.  Thana now starts to roam the streets of New York at night, deliberately enticing men and then, once they respond, gunning them down.  In perhaps the film's most famous scene, Thana dresses up as a sexy nun and takes on a street gang.  Anyway, Thana becomes progressively more and more unhinged (and since this is an Abel Ferrara film, the New York imagery becomes more and more surreal and Hellish) and goes from shooting just potential rapists to any man who crosses her path.  While the plot may make this sound like just another exploitation flick, the film actually has a disturbing intensity to it that makes it, at times, quite disturbing to watch.  Ferrara's direction, while stylized, is also far more realistic than most other exploitation films and Tamerlis's amazing performance keeps the film rooted in a very real sense of pain and danger.  She is the center of the film and she plays every aspect of her character with such force and credibility that its hard not to get sucked into her fractured reality.  And its a reality that stays with you long after the film is over.",N/A
385172,"Alien survivors of a disintegrated galaxy attack the Earth in saucer shaped spaceships armed with death rays. Despite its pulp magazine origins, this film exceeds expectations due to Ray Harryhausen's magical special effects and a literate script. The astonishing stop-motion animation by RH is the real star of the film. The constraints of the B&amp;W photography are a hindrance, but RH rises to the occasion. The only thing missing is a rampaging radioactive beast from outer space. The generic spaceships alone don't satisfy this wish. The aliens are covered by body armor that supports their atrophied muscles and conceal their withered facial features. Things get intense when the spaceships attack Washington. Familiar landmarks and buildings suffer explosive destruction. Conventional military hardware has no effect on the force field protecting the alien craft. Earth people suffer alien abductions, brainwashing, and thought control. McCarthy style, '50s paranoia creeps into the story. The script is otherwise intelligent, and avoids many of the typical cliches. The action moves swiftly along and doesn't waste time on subplots. Fans of Ray Harryhausen's animation definitely need this classic sci-fi flick for their collection. This is great Saturday matinee fun for 12 year old kids of all ages. Enjoy the ride. ;-)",Earth vs the Flying Saucers VHS

395519,"So many people have written about the things that make the Rocky movies so successful, and I have no doubt that I'll be repeating some of them in my review.  But I have to throw my hat in the ring anyway, so to speak.Rocky Balboa certainly qualifies as one of the most unique and determined heroes in cinema.  His story is truly an inspiraton to us all.  In the first movie, of course, he starts out with basically nothing, gets a chance to fight Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), and loses.  In the second movie, he wins the heavyweight title from Creed in a rematch.  By the third movie, Rocky is basking in the glow of his success; he and Adrienne now have a son.  But Clubber Lang (Mr. T) has been making his way to the top as well, and he challenges Rocky to a match.  Rocky trains hard and tries his best, but his concerns about his manager Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) health make it difficult to concentrate, giving Lang the advantage...and Rocky's title.  With encouragement from Adrienne and his former rival Apollo Creed, who takes over as manager after Mickey's death,  Rocky rediscovers his Eye of the Tiger in the rematch and puts Lang in his place.In the fourth movie, Apollo is killed in battle by Russian champion Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren).  In one of the most intense boxing matches of the entire series, Rocky finds the &quot;chink&quot; in the Russian's seemingly impenetrable armor.  It's worth getting the fourth movie just for that match.But, by the time of the fifth and final movie, things are quite a bit different. (As I'm writing this, I've just finished watching the fifth one for the very first time.)  Not only do Rocky and his family find out that they're broke, but Rocky seems to be suffering from brain damage as a result of his fight with Drago. He becomes a manager for a new young fighter, Tommy Gunn (upsetting his son quite a bit), who allows his ego to cloud his judgement, thus luring himself into the sleazy side of the boxing business.  When Tommy gets a shot at the heavyweight title, the audience is already in a bad mood because Rocky isn't there on stage with him.  But when Tommy takes the title in just over three rounds, the audience is REALLY in a bad mood; at least Rocky had class.Rocky and Tommy end up resolving their differences in a street fight, and for several agonizing minutes it looks like it could be the end...but Rocky has the spirit of Mickey with him, and for the fourth time, the Italian Stallion wins, proving that he's still a champion and always will be, even after fifteen years.Whenever I watch these movies I can still feel the excitement of seeing them for the first time.  When the odds are stacked against him, even in the face of several brushes with death (Tommy Gunn makes Ivan Drago and Clubber Lang look like  pussycats somtimes), he still manages to triumph.I love you, Rock...you the man!",Rocky Gift Set VHS
537483,"I saw this film at a mall theatre in the philippines which is most fiting because that country was raped and pillaged by the japanese in the war. Not that historical accuracy means anything in this movie. &quot;Pearl harbor&quot; represents commericalism at it's very worst. Nothing wrong with making a buck but this movie was made and edited in such a way to not offend anybody and great art almost always offends somebody. They didn't want the film to be too patriotic so it wouldn't turn off non americans. They didn't want to portray the japanese too harshly because they wanted the movie to sell there. There had to be a really stupid sappy love story to appeal to the teeny bobbers the way titanic did. So much effort was placed in this movie to appeal the the maximum number of people that nothing is left of redeeming value. Why bother to watch a movie about this most important historical event that cares little for history or patriotism? But they did manage to offend some people. Veterans of world war two and most veteran groups find this film offensive and many recommend that the movie be boycotted. I agree.Now even a misguided movie like this can provide some entertainment. Mississippi burning was a similarly misguided movie but it had some value because of the classic good v evil story line and a great performance by gene hackman. That's not the case here. Both leading men are terribly unconvincing and ben affleck's rafe(rafe?) was comletely dull. Kate beckinsale gives the best performance considering how shallow her character is written. Fact is the writing for the whole film is pathetic. The love story is dumber than dumb as beckinsale's squeeze rafe, gets shot down in europe and is presumed dead. Naturally ben's best buddy(played by josh hannah) moves in and knocks up beckinsdale just before our hunky leading man shows up not so dead after all. And we're supposed to care? Don't worry though because this moronic love story only consumes 2 hours of the movie. That's all.Then we get to that little incidental event of the japanese attack. The action portrayed isn't bad and you can't help but be relieved to see the story move in another direction. Our two studly heros forget about their tense romantic conflict just long enough to hop in a couple of planes and kick some butt while beckinsale and her babe nurse cohorts save lives below. It's all so exciting. When the dust clears 3000 americans are dead but you won't be moved because of the plastic video game presentation.Now apparently mr. bay et al fiqured the movie was lacking at this point so they decided on depicting dolittle's raid on tokyo. Dolittle is depicted by that great patriot himself alec baldwin whose performance isn't too bad. Again history is a little fuzzy here but it provides our heroic leading men an opportunity to be, well, heroic. Unfortunately the josh harnett character doesn't survive the attack and we are supposed to feel sad. Don't worry you won't. Great movies make you feel something. The only thing you will feel from watching this movie is that you wish you didn't waste your hard earned money on it. Titanic was the main blue print for this film. Take a love story and entwine it with a real life tragedy. Titanic suceeded because there were some real gut wrenching moments. Not in &quot;pearl harbor&quot;. As for beckindale and afflecks romance? Well they get back together of course. And Ben, rafe,(rafe?) agrees to raise his buddy's kid. Why should anyone care?Finally there is one good thing about this film. The music is great and the faith hill theme song is quite good......................socks",N/A

538342,"It's hard to imagine the premise of this film happening in real life...a young woman devotes an entire month of her life to helping the lives of complete strangers. Or, to put it mildly, she takes a new lover every month. Nelson (Keanu Reeves) is, at the start of the film, obsessed with one thing...himself. He's selfish, arrogant, and a workaholic. Sara (Charlize Theron) is a free spirit who decides that Nelson needs her ""help."" Over the course of the month, we see Nelson transformed into a lovesick sweetie (he even sings for Sara, and I was blown away...Keanu Reeves can sing, and sing well!) The month ends, but Nelson doesn't want the relationship to. He tries his hardest to win Sara over and make her forget about her ""one month only"" rule, but Sara has a secret that forces her to stick to her rule, and it's this secret that is the most devastating to Nelson. Keanu & Charlize are good together, and the film has some tender moments, but the end was a letdown for me. As far as Keanu's role goes, he seemed more comfortable in the role of laid-back nice guy instead of the arrogant person that he started out as. Of course, I will never have anything bad to say about him, as I worship the ground he walks on. Charlize gives a fine performance, as well. Frank Langella has a juicy bit part as a man who is so nasty and cold, it gave me chills, and he must have given Nelson the chills, too, because we see in his eyes a slight change as he sees in Langella what he doesn't want to become. Also, look for the lovely Lauren Graham (TV's ""Gilmore Girls) as Nelson's girlfriend, Angelica. All in all, a very sweet, touching, and sad film with wonderful performances.",N/A

569486,"The original book was the story of one trooper, Rico, and his journey to manhood in the Mobile Infantry of the 23rd century.  Rico was an archtypical grunt, or &quot;ape&quot;, no more special or important to the war effort than any other ape.  He was not particularly heroic or important to the outcome of the war.  The movie version was rightly criticized as &quot;Beverly Hills 90120 meets The Jetsons.&quot;  A banal love triangle with excessive gore and Nazification of Heinlein's concept of the World Federation.  The director made a comic strip out of the book.This version is closer to the original but shows the influence of the movie.  There's still a love triangle, there's still blood and gore (not as much as in the movie) but it's more a story about the ordinary soldiers who fight and die in any war, regardless of the century, technology, or enemy.  Brilliant, ground breaking CGI with color and texture far greater than needed in a morning cartoon show.  The production suffered when one of the 2 companies hired to do the CGI couldn't finish its work and the other's schedule suffered as a result; that's why the episodes were shown out of order, with numerous repeats, and Fridays pre-empted all the time.  This cost the show the last 2 episodes of the season that would wrapped up most of the cliffhangers.  SST:R ended with a disappointed fanbase and leaving many threads open.  Unfortunately it doesn't look like they'll ever revisit it.  But still well worth the watch.",N/A

Years later, two US Marshal's were killed in the area, and the town ended up in the national spotlight when the FBI converged into it searching for Gorden Kahl, who puportedly was hiding in the town after the killings.This story appeals to me because of that, and because of the slow, yet building work up of the characters throughout the movie.Two kids named Sam and Michael move into their grandfathers home in a town they  know nothing about.  During their stay they find out that many children are missing, presumed runaways by the authorities, and no one seems to be too interested in finding out the truth.  But, in the turn of events they discover the truth.The star that shines in this film is Kiefer Sutherland, an initially dark character, seemingly in love with his motorcycle, and viciously protecting his claim on his girlfriend.  He is a bully, as are his motorcycle friends.  As we find out that, while they remain bullies, they have the &quot;advantage&quot; of being vampires to add to their criminal behavior.Director Joel Schumacher took this movie, which could have been just a standard &quot;B&quot; fare, run in the mill teen horror picture, and rose it up to be funny, dark, and exciting.Recommended for all of you conspiracy theory nuts and vampire fans.",N/A
537477,"To coincide with the 6oth anniversary of the sneak Japanese attack against American assets, the Disney machine releases the two-disc &quot;PEARL HARBOR&quot; (Touchstone), it's gargantuan recreation of the horrific incident that sealed our involvement in WW II.Set against a sophomoric and predictable love triangle (Ben Afflect, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale), the stunning CGI enhanced invasion and the heartstopping flying sequences are all the more impressive. The Disney team had high hopes of duplicating the success of &quot;Titanic&quot; with what they thought were the same key ingredients but on an even larger scale. But alas, the critics and public did not respond in kind.What made &quot;Titanic&quot; so universally popular had to do with the idea of seeking love in a perfect world that suddenly is doomed.

269044,"""The Robots of Death"" is a well-remembered 1977 ""Doctor Who"" adventure heavy on the gothic horror favored by the show at that time. Within another year or two, the program would return to funny monsters in ill-fitting costumes, but you won't see that here.  ""Robots"" is a logical, if unsexy choice, to be the first Tom Baker/Fourth Doctor story released on DVD.Because the story is 24 years old, some of the special features are a stretch. Most compelling to US audiences is the featurette on Howard DaSilva, who provided cheezy and sarcastic voiceovers for the show when it was first aired State-side. Oddly, no photo of Howard is provided, but his lines are so amusing you'll play them often enough to wear out that sector of the disc.The long, mute, test model shots of the story's ""Sandminer"" vessel, try the patience.  Many blockbuster movies like to load their DVDs with technical features, demonstrating the magic of filmmaking. While the Sandminer shots remain impressive for a small-budget show, perhaps the DVD space may have been better reserved for more informative feature, such as one about Louise Jameson (Leela), who appeared in so few DW stories.The key feature is the commentary track by producer Philip Hinchcliffe (often credited with the show's 1970s success), and episode writer Chris Boucher. Hinchcliffe relays a few anecdotes about working with Tom Baker, but by and large the two spend the first half of the story (which neither had seen since 1977) ignoring what happens on screen, and the second half so caught up in events that the commentary nearly stops!  Hinchcliffe also keeps comparing this 1977 adventure favorably to today's big-budget Hollywood films. Well, yes.. the DVDs cost the same. However, the title of this review (spoken by Hinchcliffe, about guest-actor Russell Hunter) is more than worth the price.The copy-editing on the actor biographies is poor. Louise Jameson's TV credits are the same as Tom Baker's, and oddly omitted is the credit guest-star David Collings' biggest role, Bob Cratchit in the 1970 ""Christmas Carol"".Most important to the DVD is of course ""The Robots of Death"" themselves, and happily this story is worth your time.",Doctor Who - Robots of Death VHS
532559,"........you're about 10 years old!ok - first - the ad campaigns are terribly misleading.  this isn't a ""change your life""/""i had a near-death-experience and massive awakening"" movie; if you go into it expecting this you will be sorely disappointed.  instead, this is a more serious type of *batman* or *superman* flick with a morose, monotone, somber, melodramatic superhero sans the exaggerations of ""supernatural"" powers and strength.in other words this is a comic book on film - and little more.  really, that's the straight scoop on this flick; i kid you not!the acting is good all around, considering that the mood of this film is droll and dreary throughout - i think there was ONE joke in the entire film; aside from that all of the characters bore the same overly serious expression.  (did any of the characters actually crack a smile at all??)there could have been so much more to this movie had it been taken in the *fearless*/*awakenings*/*the game*/*cast away* direction.  but alas it was not.and the ending - it is absolutely preposterous and mathematically ludicrous.  it makes no sense - either in its conception or in the fact that it ACTUALLY worked out from the character's perspective!!  but .......... if you keep in mind that this is basically a comic book on film, then the ending may be a bit easier to swallow.on a positive note, i am forever grateful to M. Night Shyamalan for only taking 1:40 minutes to tell this story.  if this had been stretched out to 3 hours like *the green mile* or *magnolia* i would have to write a seriously disparaging review and subtract stars, etc., etc.  but as it is it's a two-star movie with a lame ending that only wastes 1:40 minutes of your life and offers a few interesting ideas as compensation (unlike *the green mile* or *magnolia* which had no redeeming qualities at all - can you tell how much i hated these movies? ...",Unbreakable

114409,"There are three sci-fi film essentials: Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis,""  ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" and ""Forbidden Planet.""  There three films defined science fiction, as we know it today.  ""Forbidden Planet,"" for example, is the father of the Star Trek franchise, and the sets provided the basis for ""Lost in Space.""  And look at all of Robby the Robots grandchildren!This film is a science fiction rewrite of  ""The Tempest,"" which helps explain its sticking power.  It has the rescue vessel, the mad scientist, and the alien mysteries, all of which capture your interest and never let you go. IT has elements of a murder mystery, with hilarious subplots about a nave young girl and hungry boys lucked up in psace for a year.  IS it 1950's cheese?  Yes, but it is fun to watch.The killer is an invisible villain.  Aside from being cheaper, this builds the suspense to an incredible level.  Come on-you see ""Alien"" and you see a lanky guy in a rubber suit. But an invisible villain lets your imagination run wild, which can be wilder than anything Hollywood can ever make.The situation of a scientific-research vessel that discovers now life and new civilization provides the pattern for Star Trek:  the main characters being the Captain, the ship's doctor and the engineer interacting.  Leslie Neilson has the same soul as William Shatner.  For good or bad, there is no Star Trek equivalent of Robby the Robot, unless you count Mr. Spock.  But I digress.Another observation is Altair's insidious wardrobe changing, which preempts Queen Amildala by five decades.  Walter Pidgeon gives a masterful performance, and steals the show.  So many mad scientists are flat and soulless-they are even passionless went it comes to their passions in science.  But Pidgeon breathes life in what could have been a cheesy 1950's science fiction throwaway.The costuming and sets are superb.  True this is 1950, so some of the sets look like they were done with Crayolas, but can any ""cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?""  The doorways in the film give you the weird impression of alien civilization. The lab and Krell building blow your mind with all of the gizmos. Nothing specific, but the overall atmosphere suggests things alien.  I wonder if they actually had an image of the Krell, or if they just made it up as they went along the image you see haloed in laser-fire may be a Krell, or may be the Krell equivalent of a Frankenstein's monster.  The plaster cast of the monster's foot suggests that the monster is an imaginary composite, but we will never know. By the way, the idea that a civilization would not have pictures is not weird ay all-Islamic art does not allow for graven images to be made, so they focus on Arabic calligraphy.  .The soundtrack is theremin based-the eerie ""oooh""-making machine from the Beach Boy's song ""Good Vibrations.""  It adds to the weirdness of the movie, and is comparable to the soundtrack in the 1981 remake of  ""Flash Gordon.""  Most experimental soundtracks flop, but this comes off perfectly, since it is suggested that the music we a re listening to is actually Krell music.The DVD is an annoying two-sided disc with letterbox and ""pan and scan"" on each side.  People-Wide screen, wide screen, wide screen!Two parting thoughts:First, at the heart of this movie is a psycho-thriller that brings your mind to the edge as you are forced to look at yourself.  We have the technology and the power to be gods, but can we stand it if in our hearts, we are devils?

Kurt Russell was okay (he's starting to show his age a bit), and I enjoyed Courtney Cox's trailer park ingenue a lot...but the reason to see this movie is, believe it or not, Kevin Costner.The best comparison I can make to this radically-against-type casting of him in this movie is when Henry Fonda put on a black hat for Sergio Leone's &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot;. You just don't expect to see a typically romantic lead in role like this. And Costner nails it with a vengeance. He smokes. He steals things. He kills more-or-less everything in his path. Worse still for these politically-correct times, he drinks and drives and fills out sex questionnaires in magazines. He really makes this otherwise cookie cutter action flick work. The film itself will serve to provide additional ammunition for Costner bashers everywhere (you know who you are), but that's unfortunate, because his performance here is absolutely outstanding. It's worth at least a rental...and if you're a fan of either Costner or action flicks, it's certainly worth owning.",3000 Miles to Graceland
522394,"I am a huge action fan, love most of Tom Cruise's movies, and loved the first Mission:Impossible movie.  However, this one is not on par with that movie by any stretch of the imagination.  I actually thought of giving this movie 1 star, but some of the action and visual effects were stunning, so that boosted my score.The film starts out brilliantly, and the mountain scene was breathtaking.  It all goes downhill from there...  I really think John Woo is off his rocker.  In the commentary in one of the special features on the DVD, he says he wanted to direct a love story.  Good try buddy!  And the action scenes were overdone and unrealistic.  I am impressed that Cruise did most of his stunts, but some of the stuff was just stupid, like the cartwheel kick at the end.  Can you actually tell me that someone would not be able to get out of the way?  They should have just stuck with a realistic fight scene, where the blows would actually hurt in real life.  This was further worsened by the slo-mo that was used constantly.  At least at regular speed it may have looked somewhat believable.Despite the problems I had with some of the action scenes, the worst part of the movie had to do with all the masks that were used.  I mean, how believable is it that Cruise kept a mask of his face, as well as a mask of each of the bad guys?  Added to that, who would believe that it was the same guy?  Remember, Cruise is short...at least three inches shorter than Dougray Scott.  Anybody would've been able to pick up on this...I am just so frustrated because they really wasted what could have been a good sequel.  Do yourself a favor and buy Mission:Impossible.  Rent MI:2 only if you want to laugh at the garbage that John Woo made.",N/A

Ever notice how serial killers in these types of movies want to get caught, try to get and at the end of the movie, get caught??  The director of this movie had this meticulous serial killer who planned everything out.  Then, the killer becomes sloppy and any old girl would do.  Garbage.  I guess if you can't find anything you have not seen yet you should watch this.  But, don't buy it.",The Watcher
81518,"Muriel Heslop is a young woman who dreams of getting married and moving far away from her boring life in Porpoise Spit, Australia. Unfortunately, even after her dreams do come true (and changes her name to Mariel), she discovers that while she has gained everything she has desired, she has also alienated herself from her family and her best friend Rhonda, and by the end of the film goes back to being good-ol' Muriel Heslop.The performances in this film were excellent, especially Toni Collette in the lead (who gained a few pounds for her role), and future Oscar nominee Rachel Griffiths as Rhonda, a woman suddenly sticken with a potentially fatal illness.Despite it's seemingly simple plot, it's a suprisingly rich and complex story. It's about a family on the verge of insanity, the value of friendship, and is a fable with a positive message: Be yourself, and you will like yourself for it.Whether you like comedy or drama, you'll absolutely fall in love with this movie.",N/A
116626,"This is one of only two movies that I have ever seen THREE times in the theater...and, since I bought it on DVD a year ago, I have probably seen it a total of at least 10 times by now.  It is a movie that draws you in, not just with its mind-boggling special effects, but also with its underlying story.  The story is so neatly woven into it all, and the whole film is so fast-paced, that on first (or even third) viewing, it's difficult to be able to follow it all.  Sorry, all you &quot;dissenters&quot; out there, but if you didn't like this film, then you obviously just didn't get it.I'm a relatively smart moviegoer, but I did not totally get all the details in the entire movie myself, the first few times around.  I loved it the very first time I saw it, and I knew that it was a great, groundbreaking film.  But honestly, I got maybe about 40% of what was going on.  I began to lose track of what was happening after Neo takes the red pill.  Fortunately, this movie works on so many levels, that it can even be enjoyed on the level of a high-tech, high-kickin', sci-fi-action thriller.  But something about this film intrigued me so much, the way &quot;The X-Files&quot; on TV used to intrigue me.The second time I saw THE MATRIX, I was up to about 60% in my understanding of it.  At this point, I got most of the major details, (like what happens after Neo takes the red pill) but I still didn't fully understand exactly what the agents, or the sentinels, were.  On my thrid viewing, I finally got this point, but I wouldn't say that I got 100% of it--I got maybe up to 90%.  But everytime I have seen it since, it adds something new to my understanding of the incredible world of THE MATRIX.  This is the mark of a GREAT FILM:  One that makes you want to come back for more, even when you don't understand everything in it, and gives you something new every single time you see it.THE MATRIX was great to see in the theater, but it is an even greater experience on DVD.  It was cool on the big screen, but on DVD the film is much sharper (it almost makes you think that your TV set is HDTV), and it has all the great extras that you would expect from a DVD--plus many great ones that you WOULDN'T expect.  Besides the great behind-the-scenes documentary &quot;HBO First Look: Making the Matrix,&quot; you get the incredible feature &quot;Take the red pills to view two hidden special effects documentaries: &quot;What is Bullet Time?&quot; and &quot;What is the Concept?&quot;&quot; which delves much more into what the special effects are and how they are accomplished.  Plus, there is the feature that allows you to see the film and, at certain points, a &quot;white rabbit&quot; pops up on the lower right-hand corner of the screen.  If you click &quot;ENTER&quot; on your remote while the white rabbit is up on the screen, you get taken to a mini-behind-the-scenes-featurette on exactly how they made that particular scene (this is NOT taken out of the HBO behind-the-scenes feature.  It's pretty incredible!  Of course, the Commentary by Carrie-Anne Moss, editor Zach Staenberg and visual effects supervisor John Gaeta is also very cool. Overall, it's like nothing I've ever seen before.  I can't wait for THE MATRIX 2, or whatever its title will be, to come out!!Bottom line to all this: If you loved the movie, you'll go ga-ga over the DVD!!!!",N/A

93773,"In 1995, Director David Fincher joined Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt inthe years most disgusting, tense and talked about films.  Seven is alook into a persons liking for gore and blood, all done through thetheme of the 7 deadly sins.  Unlike Fight Club, another Fincher film,Seven was made right before the DVD format was introduced.  Theinitial release of Seven on DVD was less then spectacular.  The NewLine Platinum series is visually one of the most stunning releases tocome along in a while.  Sonically, this release will surround you withsound elements of such clarity and depth, it may seem too real attimes.  The 2 disc package is similar to the Fight Club package.  Ithas two nicely designed discs in an attractive package.  The menudesign on the discs are very impressive.  What may seem confusing atfirst becomes quickly understandable and easy to navigate throughout.Disc 1 has the movie along with commentary by David Fincher, MorganFreeman and Brad Pitt.  It also has commentary by the Screenwriter,the Editor, a Professor of Film Studies and the new Line President ofProduction.  These commentaries are very insightful, informative andentertaining to listen to.  The scene selections are nice, shown withstill pictures and a title of each sequence.  Disc 1 also has a simple'color bars' setup.  Picture quality of this movie is outstanding tosay the least, especially if you compare this release with theprevious DVD release.  The original negative was used this time, andthe darkness of this film has never looked so incredibly clear.Contrast and colors are beautiful...not too saturated for this type offilm, but quite stunning.  Sharpness is well executed throughout thefilm and I found it hard to see any grain or dirt on the picture.This is obviously a first class transfer and the anamorphic widescreenpicture is superb.  Sound quality is even more amazing.  When you goto your setup in the menu, you have a choice of English or Frenchsubtitles.  You also have a choice of stereo Surround Sound, Dolby EXSurround Sound or DTS ES Surround Sound.  Whatever type of system youhave, this film shines.  If you have a surround system with a greatsubwoofer, you will not believe your ears.  This film has been rebuiltfrom the ground up and remixed for DVD.  Effects elements andatmospheric sound effects will simply blow your mind.  Dialogue isclean and clear.  The sound department responsible for this soundtrackshould be applauded.  They did a superb job.  Disc 2 has a bunch ofextras that will keep you busy for quite a while.  The first extra onthe disc is an &quot;exploration of the opening title sequence.&quot;You get to choose from different angles and different audio optionswhile watching this sequence.  You can watch an early storyboarddrawing of the title sequence, a rough version of the opening and thefinal version of the opening title sequence.  You can choose from asurround mix, a Dolby EX mix that was made just for this DVD, or ahigh quality 24bit/96Khz stereo mix.  It's amazing how many optionsyou get to pick from just to watch something about the opening titlesequence!  You can also listen to commentary by designer Kyle Cooperor the Sound Engineers Brent Biles and Robert Margouleff.  Wow!  Thenext pick on Disc 2 is where you get to see &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot;and &quot;Extended Takes&quot; from the film, all with or withoutDavid Finchers commentary.  There are seven scenes to choose from andare all fascinating to watch while listening to the commentary.  Thenext pick on Disc 2 are the &quot;Alternate Endings.&quot; You haveyour choice of the original &quot;test&quot; ending with or withoutDavid Finchers commentary.  You also can look at an animatedstoryboard of an unshot ending.  This was done really well and bothoffer subtle differences and insight into the ending that is in thefilm.  Next, you can look at a bunch of Production Design stills withcommentary.  This was also done very well, considering how amazing theProduction Design really is for this film.  You next have choices of abunch of other still photographs from the film, including John Doe'sphotographs, Victor's decomposition, police crime scene photographsand production photographs.  These come all with commentary, and thisis the first disc where I actually enjoyed still photos on aDVD....very well done.  Another choice you have on Disc 2 is called'The Notebooks.&quot; This is a very informative sequence of stillswith commentary on how those infamous notebooks were created.  Whenyou choose &quot;Promotional Materials,&quot; you can watch thetheatrical EPK or the movie trailer.  As with most DVD's, you canchoose &quot;Filmographies&quot; where you can see the resume's of allthe actors and many crew members.  Finally, for all you technicalpeople out there, you can choose &quot;Mastering for the HomeTheatre.&quot; This is a fantastic look into the film to videotransfer of Seven, as well as the color correcting, telecine, audiomastering and mixing of Seven for the theatre as well as the remixingfor the DVD.  All are played with scenes from the film comparing thelast release and this release of Seven.  The commentary is botheducational and entertaining to listen to.  In conclusion, Seven is amust have DVD.  Picture quality is outstanding.  Audio quality isfantastic, and the extras are wonderful.  If you loved Seven in themovies, or want to replace your old DVD release with this one, buySeven and prepare yourself for 2 hours of amazement.  If you are alover of crime thrillers then get this disc. If you enjoy MorganFreeman, Brad Pitt or David Fincher then get this disc.  It would be asin NOT to get this DVD! Enjoy!",Seven
247583,"i really love this film (it's pointless to argue whether or not it's fellini's best), and it's a nice complement to the recently rereleased &quot;8 1/2&quot;: in that film an alienated male protagonist discovers his deep connection to other people, while in &quot;juliet&quot; a housebound female discovers her uniqueness, and separateness from other people. masina is splendid in the title role, attractive yet mousy, yielding yet strong, and she captures the stages of disillusionment, denial, pain, wandering and final clarity with incredible directness. her final liberation, as she walks alone out of her prim garden and into a stately mysterious forest, is a beautiful affirmation. this is also a film where fellini's elliptical, dreamlike techniques work extremely well to increase rather than diffuse the mood of tension and pain. the ample sandra milo is amusingly sexy as the free spirited neighbor, and some of the cut footage mentioned by other viewers include her &quot;over the top&quot; costume scenes. i hope the new theatrical release restores the original version (which i saw as a teenager in the late '60s), as this often precedes an authoritative dvd release. but despite the cuts and the annoying white on white subtitles, this is a film to treasure in any format you can find it.",N/A

483142,"Nashville is one of the most interesting, intelligent and compelling movies to ever come out of Hollywood. Featuring bravura performances from each of the 24 main characters, it is a brilliant examination of American society, politics, religion, showbusiness and culture. This 157 minute film tackles all of these issues at a steady pace (the director's control is absolutely superb), leading up to a shattering denouement. Despite being made in 1976, Nashville still packs a hell of a punch - its themes are still relevant today.The eponymous setting of the movie is synonymous with politics. From the start of the movie, a campaign wagon for a presidential candidate drives all over the town spewing political slogans and ideals to the residents: this wagon links all of the characters together. As Robert Altman follows it, he focuses on all of Nashville's protagonists using brief vignettes that each tell a short story of their own - gradually, all of these characters intertwine and eventually, converge on the eve of a political rally.Each of these vignettes are so concise, so telling in their exposition of the character, that the viewer almost immediately fathoms an understanding of what each protagonist is like. Who to fear; who to admire; who to respect; who to pity. Altman peppers the movie with over one hour of music - after all, Nashville is the home of country/western. The lyrics ring true with certain characters and elicit emotional responses from the viewer. ""We [Americans] must be doing something right to last two hundred years,"" sings one character at the start of the movie - later on, scenes that show a woman forced to strip, as well as a shooting, deliver a sharp ring of irony to the lyric.All of the performances in the movie are brilliant, the most notable of which is Lily Tomlin. She is especially good as the mother of two deaf children, all the while struggling with her marriage. Her husband makes no effort to translate his deaf son's story of swimming lessons: ""what's he sayin'?"" he asks. Her sorrow translates beautifully to the screen with the help of Nashville's score. Each actor conveys their character's emotions to the viewer with relative ease, which consequently heightens understanding and compels the viewer to watch on with interest. Because the viewer can connect with each of the characters, the finale is that much more heartbreaking.  Ultimately, Nashville is a brilliant character study of epic scope and proportions. The technical brilliance behind the movie in conjunction with the excellent performances culminates to create one of the most rewarding and intelligent movies in motion picture history. Nashville leaves the viewer with one clear impression: each of us, whether we like it or not, are part of a society that is both good and bad - behind all the politics, the foul play and the heartbreak, we can still manage to carve out an existence of sorts, and ultimately be happy.",Nashville
263296,"TONY ROME, if you had noticed, is not a Republic Pictures B detective movie.  It's up a grade or two with a dashing good script and . . . WHAT a cast!

Well, maybe not in Charlie Chan's class, a gumshoe who never laid a bookie bet as Tony Rome often does.

You just can't help enjoying Sinatra's laid back style. Yeh! I think younger folks could handle this film. The language is unsmutty.  The sex is rather subtle and nothing naughty goes on in the back seat of Sinatra's Ford-bulls-eye-tail-lites convertible The violence is certainly minimal by today's standards. For example, my wife at the finish asked, &quot;Has he killed only three people?&quot; Actually, I counted about five.

514955,"This special Christmas installment of the sensational 1963-1964 ""Judy Garland Show"" is quite possibly the best of the series.  For anybody who can remember watching this program when it originally aired on CBS-TV on Sunday night, December 22, 1963, I'm guessing that each one of you has a bit of a lump in your throat when re-watching this excellent DVD today, because you can no doubt recall very vividly the times in which it aired for the first time:  exactly one month after our President (John F. Kennedy) had been killed in Dallas.This Garland entry was then (and probably still is) kind of a bittersweet memory, coming so close to one of America's worst tragedies in our history. I can feel some of 1963 come right through the screen when I watch this Christmas show.  It's just THERE, and it comes through (at least for me).Judy and company do a standout job in comforting a distressed nation during this 1-hour party. Guests Jack Jones and Mel Torme are also on hand to add to the festive atmosphere, along with Judy's three children, Liza, Joe, and Lorna.I know from reading various books that Christmas time was indeed very special to the Garland clan....and that fact really shines through during this program!  The love these 4 had for one another is very evident.  This point is driven home with force at the very end of this show, when Judy sits down, with pajama-clad Joe & Lorna by her side, and sings ""Over The Rainbow"", with the two kids snuggling ever-closer to their famous mom.  A great end to a fine Christmas treat.This program shines on DVD, but don't entirely dismiss the idea of getting this great show on VHS tape as well. The VHS version looks pretty good too (considering, of course, the limitations that exist on that video format).Plus -- the ""LaserLight"" VHS edition (with the red box and the holly & berries on the cover) contains the original CBS-TV commercials that aired on the December night the show was broadcast for the first time in 1963. The VHS running time is 59 minutes, so you know nothing has been cut at all.  The inclusion of the TV ads, in my opinion, is a good one. Being able to see the old TV commercials of the era brings back even more memories of the 1960s. The DVD version does not have these commercials included. But, of course, the DVD's picture quality is better than the VHS.Judy Garland's legend and enormous talent lives on with Pioneer Artists' splendid series of DVD-Video programs spotlighting this one-of-a-kind superstar.

384776,"This is an underrated gem from Sidney Lumet. This film could very easily have departed from its ultimately brilliant course, and been turned into an overblown, over-the-top, unrealistic &quot;Doomsday&quot; farce.  But Lumet holds on to reality and presents us with a very realistic, and quite frightening look at what could possibly happen if one of our bombers should get a false message to attack Moscow. Henry Fonda is totally believable as the U.S. President trying to avert a catastrophe. And check out a young pre-&quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; Larry Hagman as the Russian interpreter! I liked Larry very much in this role.  He, like everyone else in this good cast, remains completely realistic and believable.

80237,"From the first time I saw this feature back in the '50s, I have loved it most of all...there is so much here that is reminiscent of the Golden Times of childhood, what a special time it is and how fleeting...the idea that one can choose not to grow up at all, but live as a perennial child in a place of beauty, some danger, although not real danger, just enough to keep things interesting, and adventures and wonderful spots throughout the island to visit, is a universally appealing one. The music is perfectly suited to this vision of Halcyon days gone by, from the favorite &quot;I Can Fly&quot; to &quot;The Pirate Song&quot; to &quot;What Makes the Red Man Red&quot; to the Lullaby that Wendy sings to the Lost Boys, it's just wonderfully evocative and captures the mood of each moment perfectly.The opening shot that slowly zooms in to the Darling house is fabulous, as is the extraordinary detail of the house itself; I notice something different every time I see it. The animators built an exact miniature of the house down to the smallest detail and fixtures, etc, to aid them in their drawing, and this attention to detail and quality are very apparent throughout.The voices, from Bobby Driscoll as Peter to Kathryn Beaumont as Wendy are wonderfully voiced, very believable without being cloying or self conscious, real kids having real adventures.The colors are so various and rich it stuns the eye, as does the shot of the Island of Never Never Land, the first time we see it, from high above, the Pirate Ship anchored in the harbor, Mermaid Lagoon, the Indian Camp, etc, it is SO beautiful and amazing that they (the animators) were so astute in their picture of a child's fantasy, their own island of adventures. The interaction between Captain Hook and the Crocodile is very funny, as is the byplay with Hook and Smee, the bumbling, endearing servant to the Captain. Tinker Bell is great as the jealous, somewhat snippy fairy who accompanies Pan wherever he goes and displays loyalty of the first order, being willing to sacrifice her life for his.I also love the animal outfits worn with great joy by the Lost Boys, who are a fascinating group in their own right. Despite all the fun and adventure, the Darling children opt to return to their own home and Pan obliges them in yet another visually stunning scene when Tinkerbell transforms the Pirate Ship into a thing of beauty by showering it completely with golden fairy dust.When they have been safely deposited back into their room, the Darlings return from their party just in time to see Peter sailing across the night sky in the wonderful Pirate Ship, which travels across the Moon on a sea of clouds...Wendy, Mr. and Mrs. Darling watch from the Nursery window, and we leave them there, a family, happy and united in their wonderment, the adults and the child, together in their memories of a wonderful chapter of Youth Eternal, as all remember their own experiences with Peter Pan, the boy of Youth and Joy forever.",N/A
28741,"Dumb and Dumber is one of the most entertaining movies of all time, and one of Jim Carrey's finest works. The heart-wrenching story of a man and his best friend going on a journey to find a woman in order to return her bag to her won't bring a tear to your eye, but it will definately make you laugh. Jeff Daniels, an actor who isn't considered by most people as funny, does a grear job in this movie as the dumb one of the two, this is obvious when he and Carrey are attempting to read a newspaper. The dumber of the two, Jim Carrey, provides more laughs than ever, and a huge collection of new jokes.  As with most comedy movies, this movie isn't judged by the quality of the story, but rather the quality and quantity of its jokes. This movie's story is actually not too bad.

In the film, Bruce Willis (currently the brooding lead of such films as &quot;Unbreakable&quot;) is a smart-mouthed New York cop who visits Los Angeles to attend a Christmas party at a building where his wife is working.  &quot;Terrorists&quot; arrive to spoil the preceedings, leaving Willis alone, exhausted, barefoot, and the only one who can stop them.  Despite it's numerous and carbon-copy immitators, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a great action epic, and it's displayed quite nicely in this new 5-star DVD release.  First off, you get two audio commentaries: one with director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia explaining the difficulties of starting a movie that DIDN'T have a ending set in stone and filming in a studio-owned building, and a second one with visual effects supervisor Richard Edlund explaining some technical aspects of the film and the secret behind Bruce Willis' &quot;barefoot&quot; performance.  A text commentary (like the text commentary on &quot;The Abyss&quot; DVD) is also available where the film is analyzed through numerous interviews with the actors, producers, and film critics.  On the second disc, there's a good amount of stuff to keep you busy.  There's a deleted scene (also on the first disc) and some outtakes, trailers, TV ads, articles on the film, the script (NOT just in DVD-ROM form), and a slick little treat called &quot;The Cutting Room&quot;.  Here, you can see how elements work in some of the big scenes in this film by either changing takes or playing with the sound.

529460,"Well, it's a just a bunch of guys talking about women. They're all players, and they share their exploits--except for the married guy, who's a foil to the others. It's kind of a stuipd premise, and most of the scenes are pretty obvious and not funny.Predictably, they all end-up involved with the same girl (Mia, played by the super-cute Amanda Peet). The execution of that twist is well-done and works to inject interesting irony under the humor. But that's really the only thing going in the whole plot. The conflict development happens a little bit late in the movie, which makes it something of a slow start. (Just a little. I mean, it's not as a bad as &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;.)The to-the-camera narratives are done out-of-context of the movie, which makes them plausible and less awkward than in most other movies that try this silly technique. And since they're less awkward, they come off as a little bit more insightful.The plot resolution is a little ambiguous, and kind of sudden. But the movie examines the aftermath very deeply, and that's where it makes its point; that's where the real curve ball comes out.",Whipped
421576,"The second sequel to Die Hard, Die Hard 3 doesn't top the original, but definetly delivers a few laughs and some great acion sequences. Bruce Willis, who reprises his role as John McClane, has to do whatever Simon (a madman played by Jeremy Irons) says or he'll blow up a public place. Along to help McClane is Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) the third and last of the male leads. Although the plot gets a lot more complicated and is full of different twists and turns, I not going to tell you anymore because I'll be giving away the whole movie.Although Die Hard 3 doesn't have nearly as much action as the first two, it does deliver hilarious dialouge (courtesy of Sameuel L.

For example, there is metro train explosion, a car chase, a bloody elevator shootout, a trip down the watery aqueduct tunnels, a pleasant drive through the park, a little side trip to a huge boat, and a helicopter shootout.

This time, McTiernan decided to all out and make the film take place in a whole city instead of a building.

290331,"An antique curio from 1931 which is made watchable out of basic curiousity more than anything else. The incredible Helen Hayes won an AA for this - her first film role. Based upon THE LULLABY, Helen is naive and simple as the innocent young country girl in love with (God help us all) Neil Hamilton (remember the hammy inspector Gordon on BATMAN?). It's a story (more complex than most - in a MADAME X vein) about mother love and self-sacrifice. Madelon becomes a kept woman who gets involved with a lurid scandal -and does time - eventually she takes a walk down the primrose path. The make-up used to age Hayes is astonishingly realistic, but it's Hayes's acting expertise (even at the age of 31) which makes one believe that she's an elderly person - her voice, gestures and inflections are amazing to observe. Madelon's little boy grows up to a highly esteemed doctor (he's played by the 24-year-old Robert Young).  Marie Prevost plays Helen's pal Rosalie and she's memorable as the common little tart with a heart. The unfortunate Prevost (her good friend was Joan Crawford) was a pathetic creature.  A weight problem denied her roles in pictures and she was found dead in 1937 of malnutrition in a seedy room half eaten by her dog.  There was a modest cheque found in her dresser endorsed by none other than Joan Crawford.",Sin of Madelon Claudet VHS
210725,"FRIDAY THE 13TH is, in my opinion, the greatest slasher movie of all time, and my favortie movie of all time.  It set the standard for the horror of the 80's to follow, and it's the type of movie that still scares you all these years later.  Loaded with atmosphere, suspense, and fun setpieces, FRIDAY THE 13TH is a classic among classics.  Later followed by some great and not so great sequels, audiences will find this movie to be the strongest in the series.  The new DVD is just gorgeous.  The picture has never looked better and the sound and color have never been more crisp.  Old movies like these often suffer from age on VHS, but thanks to a nice transfer by Paramount, this DVD is worth the money.  As always, there are no extras except for a trailer, but just watching the trailer is a treat for die hard fans.",Friday the 13th 1 VHS
89465,"Eraser is exactly the kind of movie that demonstrates the paucity of Hollywood's imagination--not in filmmaking, but in celebrating its own peculiar achievements. Eraser never set out to be a &quot;good&quot; film, and it succeeds spectacularly at not achieving this goal. And why shouldn't Hollywood celebrate this kind of filmmaking? After Russell Crowe took best actor for Gladiator it seems apparent that the Oscars need entirely new categories: instead of best actor, how about best OVER-actor? Or &quot;Worst Dialogue Delivered Thoroughly Convincingly?&quot; It takes talent to go so far over the top that you come back again! I'd nominate James Colburn for &quot;Best Lee Marvin Impersonation&quot; and certainly James Caan would sweep the &quot;Most Intensely Smoked Cigarette&quot; category--can that guy suck smoke like nobody else! And Eraser might take &quot;Thinnest Thread of a Plot on Which Action Sequences Can Be Hung&quot;, although competition would be fierce. It would also be nominated for &quot;Coolest Sci-Fi Gun and Nozzle Flashes/Tracer Fire&quot; but wouldn't even get a mention for &quot;Most Buckets of Bullets&quot; or &quot;Most Buckets of Blood&quot;. Schwarzenegger himself could receive a lifetime achievement award for &quot;Most Throwaway Lines Obscured By An Accent&quot; which would complement his earlier &quot;Most Herculean Physique&quot; award nicely.

25177,"For some reasons I had reservations about seeing this film when I first heard about it; maybe because what I heard and the advertising I saw didn't begin to hint at its depth. Ostensibly its the story of two WASPs who get stranded in the Australian outback and meet an aborigine boy who helps them to surive their journey back to civilization. Most noticeably, for me, the movie criticizes the spiritual emptiness of civilized society and lets the viewer glimpse at some of uncharted territory's secret beauty. The movie works fine on this level. But its brilliance lies in how many different levels it does work, and its subtlety.It is a tragic story of two people who fail to communicate. The blindess of the girl (presented in quite a harsh light, and a symbolic big slap in the face to whitey now that I rethink it) despite huge language and cultural differences is inept or unwilling to understand the aborigine boy's perspective. Indeed she is deeply rooted in Anglo-Saxon values -- only the young boy, her companion, is able to break down the barrier and communicate simple ideas.There are points in the film that expose sexual tension as brilliantly and as subtley as I have ever seen. It is vastly important that the boy is not dramatized or stylized in any way, he seems really to have been picked out of the outback and cast directly in the movie. His behavior should seem at least somewhat bewildering to the audience, it was to me, particularly in the haunting mating dance scene. The girl rejects him out of a lack of understanding and fear, and he sheds tears of failure. Was sexual consumation a part of his walkabout or did he fall deeply for this girl. What are the cues to suggest the latter? I'd have to watch the movie again.Walkabout is delicate and complex but doesn't spoil itself by becoming overambitious. There are many, many internal psychological and emotional aspects of the two children that remain rightfully unexplored. Suffice to say being shot at by your dad and stranded in the wilderness might create some wrenching immediate -- nevermind longterm -- consequences. The film could easily have veered off into myriad branches and lost track of itself. Roeg decides to focus on particular elements and does so meticulously and with grace.And for the film's obvious disdain for civilized society, it doesn't necessarily suggest that the boy has an easier or more satisfying life. It merely presents a different angle -- though that angle is shot in breathtaking, but unsentimental, beauty. There is no sap in this film; the score is moving but does not grab forcefully at one's heartstrings. The shots of the outback are gorgeous, but they do not imply any false notions of peace in nature. And for these very reasons, the film, I would imagine, would be great at exposing both beauty and the harsh face of reality to kids despite all the complexity that wouldn't be understood.",N/A
260742,"CONQUEST is perhaps the most important in the series since it tells the opposite story of the first APES movie.  Now, apes are abused and dumb and humans are in control.  The movie is extremely violent and dark in its dipiction of man's treatment of ape.  If you do not like abuse on animals then I suggest you avoid CONQUEST since the apes are treated horribly....so horribly it gets to be disturbing.  The movie itself is interesting and ingaing to watch, but unlike the previous movies, the most part of this movie is serious with very little comedy reliefe or moments of joy.  The dark tone is eventually lifted when the apes rebel against the humans and re-claim the planet in what is one of the most powerful and important climaxes of the series.  Roddy McDowall's final speech at the end of the movie is perhaps one of the best speeches in movie history.

Those who know and admire the book will be pleasantly surprised with this mostly-forgotton (and unjustifiably so) Technicolor gem from 1938. In its day, this version had all that money could buy (most notably Technicolor!) The previously unknown child actors amazingly look just like Tom and Becky should look; it just misses greatness (Tommy Kelly was no Freddie Bartholomew) but its still a film filled with endearing, nostalgic scenes, faithfully reproduced.......... After whitewashing Aunt Polly's fence, Tom and Huck visit the cemetery on a strange, nocturnal errand. Huck has a dead cat in a bag and a theory that by heaving it after the devils who carry off the corpse of a newly buried sinner, a boy can get rid of worts. In the cemetery, Tom and Huck witness a murder by Indian Joe; they sign in blood an agreement never to tell. Tom and Becky go exploring and get lost in a limestone cave, then there's the sequence where the pirates return to their own funeral..........Incredibly, more than 25,000 kids were interviewed in the search for suitable child actors to fit the roles of Tom and Becky.

They hear a curse that surrounds the movie that basicly when ever someone has tried to finish it before, they end up dead. Not listining they track down the movies original star who was also attacked by the killer on set but turned the tables on him and killed him. She doesn't want to go back to set but does anyway. As soon as the students start filming they start to dissapear in gory fasion, it seems the killer is back.  Cut is a truly great movie that deserves to be up there with Scream instead of going straight to video everywhere. It's probably one of the only Australian slasher films out there and like most Aussie horror there is buckets of blood. The charicter development could of been alot better, most of them I couldn't even remeber there names. The killer is cool, I loved when you found out who he was in the ending a bit of a surprise. His weapon was wierd it was a modified pair of ardin shears, I loved the line &quot;it's not a knife officer, just a pair of gardin shears, slightly modified so I can do interesting things with it, like chop heads off&quot;. Another cool thing was that this starred 80s teen queen Molly Ringwald as one of the leads.

662978,"This is not a very good movie. In fact, it seems as if the film makers have taken the most dull, predictable, and conservative route that this subject matter has ever seen. If you are a fan of the classics Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Psycho, don't even bother wasting your time on Ed Gein. With a few quick edits, this could play on network television. There is absolutely NO shock value or gore. The director spends an inordinate amount of time illustrating Gein's relationship with different town members. This is so boring and no one cares! The fact that the man had SEVERED HEADS hanging from his door and dressed in a body suit of DEAD SKIN are just briefly passed over; and I mean briefly. The reason why people wanted to see a movie about Gein is to know the intimate and sick details of what he actually did to his victims. As a film, Ed Gein is so conservative that the most disturbing part is watching his mother and father gut one of the pigs on the farm. Railsback is decent as Gein but attention to detail is overlooked, like having his mom be rail \-thin when in reality she was heavy. The scene were he kills his older brother is pretty ridiculous too, complete with computer generated fire. All in all, I am still waiting for someone to have the guts to show what actually happened inside of that farmhouse. Until that day, I will continue to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre and believe all the hype about Ed Gein.",N/A

506924,"Welle's never had final cut after Kane.  Everything from Ambersons on was in some way shape or form re-edited or &quot;fixed&quot; by it's producers.  Occaissionally it was minor interferrence (like &quot;The Stranger&quot; or &quot;Touch Of Evil&quot;).  Frequently is was outright (possibly malicious) butchery like &quot;...Ambersons&quot;, or &quot;...Shanghai&quot;.But &quot;Othello&quot; seems to fall into the category of stupidity and incompetence.  It's theoretically possible there was something wrong with the DVD I received, but I doubt it.  Apparently, running out of money, Welles hired a low-end post-prod house, who used their worst staff to complete this film.Thirty five years later it was restored (not completely, unfortunately), had is musical score reconstructed and re-recorded, and it's tracks re-mixed.  Unfortunately there wasn't much they could do abut the dialog, which remains muffled and often out of sync.But to the FILM:The score is STUNNING.  The Images are STUNNING.  What's left of the performances is good to excellent.  Othello is Welles flexing his design muscles beyond the pyrotechnics of Kane and Touch of Evil.&quot;Othello&quot; is essentially a series of perfectly composed static shots -- very much like an Eisenstien film (Alexander Nyevsky or Ivan The Terrible come immediatly to mind).  Shot in a real Castle, and brilliantly photographed by at least three DOPs, I think it may be the best designed of all Welle's films.  Here Welles doesn't use the long take, or mise-en-scene to get himself out of trouble: it's all editing, dramatic compositions and lighting.And once again he shows himself to be the master.The music is still extrodinary. The transcribing and re-recording are wonderful, and the soundtrack should be released as a seperate item.  Think &quot;The Haunting&quot; (Robert Wise), with touches of Bernard Herrman and you'll get the idea.  Even in this department Wells was breaking new ground.But for all this great stuff, ultimately (for me, at least) it's a magnificent failure.

And now with the release of this gem onto DVD, you get even more to write home to Momma about.2 Audio Commentaries - The first with Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steve Starkey and Production Designer Rick Carter is a nice mix of storytelling, special effects talk, and personal memories, while the second commentary by Producer Wendy Finerman is a more intimate setting (since she's alone), giving cute stories such as the reason why the speakers are cut off while Forrest is speaking in Washington D.C. is because no one could think of anything profound enough for him to say for real.Through The Eyes of Forrest Gump - This 30 minute documentary is one of the most famous, in that it was sold separately on video in stores all over the country...and sold well.  On the laserdisc of Forrest Gump it was included as a bonus on side 4.  So many wonderful moments from the film are discussed, including how they were able to have Tom Hanks shake hands and interact with JFK, turning Tom into a ping pong wizard, as well as making Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) believably look as if he truly lost his legs.  This is certainly not your run of the mill &quot;making of&quot; that gets boring after a few minutes.  It instead holds your interest to the point where you're saying &quot;WOW!!  So that's how they did it!&quot;  My only complaint is that the transfer of this documentary didn't seem crisp and sharp enough.  It almost seemed like they just copied it off of a laserdisc.  I happen to own the laserdisc, so I compared the two and to me, the laser looked brighter and sharper.  But it's a minor complaint.  The film itself looks great!The Magic of Makeup - A wonderful look at how the makeup in this film was so crucial to its success.  Included is makeup for Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise and Sally Field.  Tom's beard growing is interesting, but watching Sally Field being transformed into an elderly woman is astonishing!Through The Ears of Forrest Gump - This is the sort of thing most moviegoers take for granted...the sound of a film.  When you watch this segment you'll get a sense of just how important sound was in making scenes come alive: the sound of the bikes rolling after a young Forrest as he breaks free of his metal braces, the tracers and mortar explosions during the Vietnam sequence, creating different ways to convey the sound of the rain in Vietnam as Forrest had said rained in so many different ways, the storm at sea, and much more!Building The World of Gump - Creating the places and settings of the film, including Forrest's home in Alabama, Vietnam, and Washington D.C.  All crucial to the films believability.Seeing Is Believing - 11 visual effects from the film are discussed, including 2 that didn't make the final cut.  Forrest was planned to meet Martin Luther King, Jr., a scene involving dogs being released to stop what Forrest thought was a &quot;parade&quot; of black Americans, headed by King.  But because Forrest knew all the dogs since they were puppies, he unknowingly stops the violence by getting their attention with a stick, then apologizes to Mr. King, himself (&quot;They're just dogs&quot;) - The other new scene is a ping pong match with George Bush Sr when he was the Ambassador to China and having Forrest hit him in the crotch with the ball.  Both of these scenes are winners to me, but I'm sure they may have bogged down the story some, and that's why they were cut.  Nice to have them here though.Photo Gallery - Some nice still shots of the film that are definitely worth looking at.Screen Tests - A total of 7, the first 3 with Michael Conner Humphrey (Young Forrest) and Hanna R. Hall (Young Jenny), 2 with Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), and 2 with Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.).  Besides witnessing these characters coming to life for the first time through the actors, it's also interesting to see Tom Hanks before he employed Micheal Humphrey's accent to his own and how this made a huge difference.2 Theatrical Trailers - including the &quot;Remember...&quot; trailer, which contains no dialogue and just uses Alan Silvestri's wonderful score.Get the film that gave Tom Hanks his second consecutive Oscar on DVD in a nice two disc set.  Relive the magic and the memories.  Relive Forrest Gump.&quot;And that's all I have to say about that&quot;. - Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump",N/A
543039,"Like two other 2001 releases, Sexy Beast and Snatch, The Score is a tautly made heist movie. I liked it a little more than Sexy Beast and a lot more than Snatch, because director Frank Oz, unlike Jonathan Glazer and Guy Ritchie, isn't always throwing his technique in our faces. The Score doesn't pretend to be anything but an old-fashioned crime thriller, and it succeeds extremely well at it, not least because it is so beautifully cast. To see Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Edward Norton on screen together is the thespian equivalent of a six-course dinner at the Ritz. And if Brando looks as if he's consumed a few too many such dinners--his character here is a cross between Sydney Greenstreet and Truman Capote--it is still wonderful to see him again, and to see that he's still very much at the top of his acting game. As superb as the three male stars are, special mention must also be made of Angela Bassett, who brings charm and radiance to her small role as De Niro's girlfriend. The twists and turns in The Score's plot, with all the requisite double- and triple-crosses, are nothing new to any aficionado of heist movies.

The players and management study their sports on and off the gridiron. When the movie shows the game going on, it feels like you're playing. It is right there with the play and every sound made and movement is right with you and it shows everyone what it is really like. Contrary to other football movies like &quot;The Replacements&quot;, it doesn't say that the good guys always win. BELIEVABLE STORY.  Pacino does another very convincing and emotional role and Jamie Foxx does fairly decent in one of his non-comedy roles.  If you look at this in the eyes that &quot;it's just a football movie&quot; then it will seem far too long. But, if you understand it's depth and truancy of the sports world, you'll enjoy this.

I love this movie as much as I did 17 years ago.While the the special effects may seem primitive, they have a unique and entertaining quality about them, I especially like the clouds.

660960,"There is nothing wrong with sweet movies.  I love sweet movies.  I love sweet, charming, affectionate movies that observe human nature through humorous and insightful lenses.  I saw just such a movie last year.  It was called ""Almost Famous.""If you haven't seen that particular title yet, you may have to after watching ""Chocolat;"" I can't think of a more appropriate way to wash out that synthetic aftertaste.  Movies like ""Chocolat"" aren't written or directed--they're engineered.Perhaps the finest chocolate requires an exact recipe, but provocative and entertaining cinema doesn't.  Just the opposite, really--great filmmaking resists formula.  But this inconsequential fluff piece, which imagines an insular French community where the transforming power of chocolate is enough to provoke life-changing epiphanies, is so blandly predictable, so precisely calculated to make you feel warm and fuzzy, that you almost wish--no, beg--for something unexpected and off-the-wall to happen.What makes ""Chocolat"" so easily digestible--and what led the Academy to idiotically award the film five undeserved Oscar nominations, aside from Miramax's relentlessly tacky advertising campaign--is the undeniable skill and craftsmanship in front of and behind the camera.  When you've got a director as respected as Lass Hallstrom and A-list talent like Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench, you can be sure it's all going to go down smoothly.  Gorgeous cinematography and sumptuous shots of melting chocolate certainly don't hurt.But when these ingredients are at the disposal of a script that relies so frustratingly on age-old conventions, a script that obliviously trots out the most pedestrian characters--and from the self-righteous mayor and the battered wife to the innocent boy with the domineering mother, they're all here--you have to wonder what the point of assembling all this talent is.  Binoche does absolutely nothing in this film to warrant her best actress nomination--nothing, perhaps, except to remind you that a long time ago she actually took on challenging roles.  Ditto Dench, who is such a towering performer that she shouldn't even be looking down her nose at a film like this.The fact that ""Chocolat"" paid off so handsomely for Miramax is disheartening indeed--not only because it cheated far superior movies of their just desserts, but because of the unavoidable suggestion that this film actually says something important.  It doesn't.  What it does, in fact, is indulge a message of staggering phoniness and simplicity.  ""Tolerance"" is the operative word in ""Chocolat's"" artificial little fairy-tale universe--embrace everyone and everything, toss out the narrow-minded regulations and principles that once held you captive, and oh, have a Belgian creme while you're at it because chocolate is the key to unlocking the deepest mysteries of human nature.  It's movies like this that give art-house pretension a bad name.",N/A

468736,"Despite David Cronenberg's position as my second-favourite director, even an out-and-out fan like me notices when he starts to repeat himself. One of the problems with auteur directors who write, produce, and direct their movies is that you tend to see a repetition of themes. Now these might be put down to style, but there are lots of ideas here from Videodrome and The Fly, albeit with more up to the minute special effects. The obsession with the body, self-inflicted bodily change and decay is here, with a good measure of William Gibson thrown in. Unless I missed something, the idea of plugging yourself into an organic computer and experiencing virtual reality first came up in the Matrix in 1976's Doctor Who in the story The Deadly Assassin, and the idea of not knowing which reality you are in has been rather worn out by Philip K. Dick. It's not a bad film by any means, and Jude Law turns in a particularly impressive performance. It is however predictable and derivative, and a director with a track record for originality as good as Cronenberg's is capable of so much more.",Existenz VHS
397414,"Released in 1967 to controversy and criticism, now considered a classic film (the American Film Institute rated it #27 on their list of America's 100 Greatest Movies) responsible for a significant shift in cinematic direction in the late '60s, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is one of those rare films in which every facet combines to create something truly extraordinary. Anchored by strong performances from Beatty and Dunaway as the titular characters, with Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons, and Michael J.

140284,"This is by far my favorite kind of movie. I am a political junkie (Republican/Libertarian if you must ask), love international intrigue and Sinatra. I first saw this at a film festival when I was 13 and would not see it again until one night in college after a few too many gin & tonics. I then remembered the imagery that came back and wanted to play solitaire&#8230; okay not solitaire. But what this movie does do is it makes you realize the period. Done in era where anti-Communist sentiment ran strong and fears of war was as normal as the Today show is to us, this movie reminds me of a time when I did not live. Okay enough with the sappy metaphor and unclear logic.This movie is fantastic for so many reasons. First, Frank Sinatra, the standard bearer of my grandparents&#8217; generation, puts on an incredible performance. For those of us younger viewers, the concept may be difficult because the acting is so stylized and the filming technique makes it feel like a movie not a documentary. But, nonetheless this guy wasn&#8217;t an actor by trade but would make you think that this was as natural as his voice is. Second, the story is incredible and truly makes you wonder why no one writes like that any more. You are taken on such a journey and are never quite sure until the end how the tale of politics, assasiniation and [...] is going to spin together. Finally, the movie has such strong acting by other characters as to realize that perhaps needing a big name on the marquis will get people in the door, but only solid acting by everyone else gets the ticket buyer (or the DVD buyer) home happy. The cast carries their roles impeccablely and truly makes this a great piece of cinema.",N/A

535908,"Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this is a good movie. The follow-up to the critically successful ""Silence of the Lambs,"" is a meager attempt at best. I guess the problem stems from the fact that the novel was not that good. ""Shock value"" and ""tasteless"" are a few words that come to mind. In a movie with such great talent and a pretty good director, you would hope that the movie would succeed where the novel failed, but that was not the case.What intrigued me about the first film was the everlooming presence of Anthony Hopkins. Behind the glass cage, you sensed the danger in his character. In this film, he's all over the place. Now, he's just an old guy that's walking across the street. They tried humanizing him, trying to give him more emotions to work with, which was a mistake, since at face value, Anthony Hopkins looks like one of your dad's older friends - harmless - instead of the psychopathic killer we'd expect from him. His presence is gone. Now we know why he's a psychopathic killer; ...Honestly, the only thing that kept me awake in the film are the over the top gross out scenes we'd expect from a bad ""Nightmare on Elm St."" film. If this film didn't receive the NC-17 rating for violence, I don't know what will.Still, Anthony Hopkins gives a great performance. That's about it.",N/A
423733,"Mean Streets is the movie that broke out the careers of director Martin Scorcese and Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro.  The film set the mold for the directorial style that Mr. Scorcese would follow the rest of his career; including the goodfella plotline and heavy doses of doo wop music, early 60's rock &amp; r&amp;b.  The story centers around Charlie, who is a low level mobster.  He doesn't have alot of rank and privilege, but the guys in the neighborhood always seem to come to them with their problems.  Charlie is quite religious and despite his shady career, he is a nice guy.  He keeps his relationship with his epileptic girlfriend Theresa a secret and he is constantly putting out fires started by her cousin and his best friend Johnny-Boy.  Johnny is a loose cannon who in debt big time to a local loan shark.  The movie ends in a rush of gunfire and crashing cars.  Mr. Scorcese does a magnificent job of conveying the day-to-day life of guys in Little Italy.  The film has a definite personal touch and you can image that these were the guys he knew from his neighborhood. Mr. Keitel is Charlie and he does a great job of portraying him as a man with all the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Even though Mr. Keitel has the lead role and is in just about every scene, the real star of the film is Mr. DeNiro as Johnny-Boy.  He explodes off the screen with a fiery, over the top performance.

It is unfortunate that the 2 leads had barely any scenes together except until the final scene. That is what made the first, is the intense interaction between the 2.

Alex Cross was much better in &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;, but here he is just a flat photocopy of his character from that and from the incredible film &quot;Se7en&quot;. This is a character that Freeman can do well, given a script better than this one.The whole &quot;plot&quot; of the film consists of a kidnapping from a rich school.

Freeman sees that she has some talent, so he allows her to tag along and try to help him catch the kidnapper. The plot is long and drawn out, with moments where we are all supposed to feel compassion as the characters spill their guts about their past, something that is in every thriller.This movie is just a rehash of other movies. Better movies. This is a film that is not well done, just downright irritating.

284367,"This 1937 gangster flick is sensational. It tells the story of Mary Dwight and her four roomates who worked as hostesses in a nightclub. When that club is taken over by a gangster named Vanning, the club is transformed into a clip joint for unsuspecting customers. The job of the hostess is to make sure that the customers are having a good time, so that they spend their money drinking and gambling.When Mary's naive sister, Betty, whom Mary is putting through college, pays her an unexpected visit, Mary is thrown for a loop, as Betty believes that Mary has a legitimate job. Mary struggles to keep of the masquerade for naught, as Mary is arrested by the police on a trumped up murder charge. It seems that one of the nightclub customers, who had welched on a gambling debt to the club, turned up dead with Mary's telephone number in his pocket. With the matter becoming front page news, the veil is pulled from her younger sister's eyes.When kid sister Betty refuses to return to school, due to the  notoriety surrounding the arrest, which was ultimately dropped, Mary keeps her under virtual house arrest. Bored one night, she accompanies one of Mary's roommates to one of Vanning's parties, unbeknownst to Mary. It is a party from which she will never return home. When Mary discovers where her now missing sister had been, she suspects the worst and enlists the help of an idealistic prosecutor to help her.When she ultimately finds out what happened to her sister, she vows to get Vanning and tells him so to his face. Vanning, naturally, does not take her threat lightly and has his goons place his special mark on her to teach her a lesson and keep her silent. Mary, however, does not let this stop her in her quest to obtain justice for her sister. Enlisting the help of her initially reluctant fellow hostesses and that of the zealous prosecutor, she ultimately has her day in court.Vanning will rue the day he crossed swords with Mary.This is a terrific film, with wonderful, award calibre performances to be had by all. Davis, as Mary Dwight, is street smart and hard boiled. She is also lovely to look at. Her roommates and fellow hostesses, played by Lola Lane, Isabel Jewell, Rosalind Marquis, and Mayo Methot, all have great chemistry with each other and Mary. All have great dialogue with which to work, fast paced, sharp, and often witty. Moreover, they each have a beautiful wardrobe of clothing.Jane Bryan also gives a more than credible performance as Mary's fresh faced, younger sister. Eduardo Ciannelli with his authentic Italian accent is aptly sinister as the ganster, Vanning, and a young Humphrey Bogart is terrific as the prosecutor, giving a clipped, no nonsense delivery of his lines.This is, without a doubt, one of Bette Davis' best films.

It starts off with La Motta as an overweight comedian just before going on stage, in 1964, and finishes with him going on stage. The story unfolds from there on, starting in 1941.The troubled life of La Motta, from his relationships to his business deals, is shown in an unflinching manner. Martin Scorsese doesn't hold back. Every bit of violence is shown in the boxing ring and every bit outside it. Raging Bull is shot in classic black and white, reflecting the setting of the action. The close-ups, lighting, reminds me of great classical films but the depiction is all Scorsese. If it's Italian, got plenty of swearing, smart guys, pretty girls and violence it's bound to be Scorsese. Mind you, that's not a bad thing at all.La Motta's impatience, paranoia and way of dealing with things, is clearly shown, ruining his relationship with his second wife and, eventually, his brother,, played by Joe Pesci. De Niro plays the role to perfection as you feel the impact of La Motta's emotions.Raging Bull is one of my favourite films by Martin Scorsese because it's more realistic.

262989,"The Elizabeth Taylor version of CLEOPATRA has taken quite a beating over the years, and its easy to see why: the film is elephantine, with an emphasis on making everything BIG; as such, it eventually sinks under its own weight.It is difficult to imagine any other actress better suited to play Cleopatra, but Taylor does comparatively little with the role, coming off as less the complex Queen of the Nile than a luxury-loving little minx out for a slinky good time.  Rex Harrison and Richard Burton fare a bit better, although not much. Still, the emphasis is on spectacle--and in spite of the big budgets, historic costuming, and mammoth sets it is really here that the film falls apart.The problem, really, is that the film's spectacle is too imaginative and takes too many liberties.  A good example is found in the role of Cleopatra herself: the historical Cleopatra considered herself Greek and probably wore Egyptian attire only for ceremonial occasions, but the film prefers to present her flatly in stereotypical fashion, when the truth would have been considerably more complex and entertaining.  Much the same may be said for most of the characters in the film.  As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to accept these characters as anything else but movie stars playing parts.And in terms of spectacle, in spite of all the money poured into it, the movie looks cheap.  Sure, they had a budget of heaven only knows how much money, but they had to stretch it to costume so many people that the wardrobe department had to settle for nylon-looking material, and a great many of the sets betray the fact that they are sound-stage created.  Then, when really lavish spectacle occurs--as in Cleopatra's entrance into Rome--the production values clash: they seem to be two completely different movies.It is difficult for me to understand why any one would want to spend money on a VHS, much less a DVD (even with various bells and whistles added), of this particular film.  If you must see the film, you're better off renting it or catching a rerun on cable television.  For CLEOPATRA is essentially a curiosity: a film that should have worked... but didn't.",N/A

I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout though-trying to figure out how this tangled weave would become unspun. Happily, I was quite pleased with the outcome. It appears that morals stood up -or at least to a degree.  It is hard to truly understand what James had its characters really thinking and feeling throughout the movie.

But in the end, the lack of kung-fu and an engaging story leads to a big superfluous mound of color and chaos, which will only please the most diehard Hark or Hong Kong fan.  BTW: Check out Hark's finest, &quot;Peking Opera Blues,&quot; &quot;The Blade,&quot; and &quot;Time and Tide,&quot; for the best cinema has to offer from the last fifteen years.",Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain
566291,"I did enjoy this movie, but I still had a few problems with it.In general, it's a film worth seeing, with plenty of comedic and dramatic moments to keep your attention.  I grew up with a sister in beauty pageants, so I can tell you that the satire is not too far off base.My biggest problem was that I just didn't understand the motivation for Joey Lauren Adams's character to continue to put up with all of the things that Minnie Driver's character dished at her.  Who would put up with that stuff?  The complexity of Minnie Driver giving up her child to Joey Lauren Adams while still living with her is not true-to-life.  Imagine the emotional issues this would cause with all three of them - yet, they seem to see this sort of thing as &quot;normal.&quot;I was not disappointed in the acting and did shed a tear at the end of the movie.  I would recommend seeing it, just maybe not buying it.",N/A
464606,"Another small, scene stealer film from England, Little Voice is loaded with three  tour de force performance s by Jane Horrocks, Michael Caine, and  Blenda Blethyn.  Horrocks is &quot;Little Voice,&quot; the shyest of the shy daughter of a dead record store owner who is overshadowed by the obnoxious mother of mother's (Blethyn).  Caine is a small time promoter who hears LV singing to her old 33 LP collection and realizes she is a golden opportunity for him to make it to the big time.  LV sings to avoid the reality of her mother and her mother's lovers, but mostly, she sings to remember her father, the only kindness in her wretched life.  Ewan McGregor in a small bit part befriends LV, but it is Horrocks stunning singing voice that captures the film and attention.  Reprising her stage role, Horrock's dead on immitations of Garland, Shirley Bassey, and Marilyn Monroe are superb.This film is a gem and should be a part of every film library both for it's story and the music.",Little Voice

449165,"Carry On Up The Kyber is undoubtedly one of the very best of the series, if not THE best. Whilst most Carry on films suffered an onslaught of criticism from critics, they actually joined in praise for this entry, and rightly so.The Khaszi of Kalabar finds information that proves that the men of The Third Foot And Mouth regiment are not &quot;the devil in skirts&quot; as they claim to be, so he decides to bring their presence in India to an end. With Sir Sidney Ruff Diamond's (head of &quot;the devil in skirts&quot;) cushy job threatened to come to an end, he decides to take action against it.The irreplacable Hattie Jaques and Barbara Windsor are missing from this entry but most of the other regulars are here such as Sid James, Joan Sims, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Terry Scott and Bernard Bresslaw as well as featuring the talents of Roy Castle, in his only Carry On role and Angela Douglas who previously had appeared in Carry On Cowboy (1965), Screaming (1966) and Follow That Camel (1967). The best players in this historical romp are Sid James and Joan Sims as the hilarious Ruff Diamonds. Joan Sims delivery is priceless as her delicatley, well spoken voice occasionally slides into a broad cockney accent - amusing stuff!Carry On Up The Kyber is consistently funny throughout with Talbot Rothwell's script bubbling with inventive repartee and sparkling razor sharp wit. The film boasts the best ending in a Carry On film, where the gang are all keeping a stiff British upper lip and deciding to ignore the attack that's taking place outside the building, proceed to continue with their supper whilst the building is collapsing around their ears.Classic British comedy at its very best and fans of the series will be delighted.",Carry on Up the Khyber VHS

5130,"I happen to be a great admirer of the controversial Mr Greenaway. I think his direction in film is bold and produces powerful results. The Pillow Book is a great example of this talent. It is an amazing combination of his narrative technique, experimental explorations and talent for finding compelling stories. The images are beautiful, especially the shot of Vivian Wu standing in the rain covered with writing on her flesh which slowly melts away. Her character is not that complex, but the action of the story is sufficient to carry her along throughout the tale as she fights for independence and a suitable form of artistic expression. Essentially the story is about the fetishisation of books and sex. These things are enough to make a great movie in my mind.  Nagiko is a girl who goes through a ritual where her father writes on her back on her birthday as he tells her of a myth. After burning her way out of a suffocating marriage, she grows up to become a radical artist writing on bodies and searching for a man who can replace her father in the birthday tradition. She meets a talented man named Jerome who she falls in love with, but is eventually sacrificed to her father's old enemy. In the course of the narrative she writes her own Pillow Book on a series of men. It culminates in a gruesome act of jealousy and revenge (a notion not foreign to Greenaway's narratives).The scene of Jerome's suicide is particularly powerful and works well with the screen-in-screen shots because it shows in one shot the sequence between thought and action, self-perception and actual action. This is a new style for Greenaway that works tremendously well in this movie because it fits so well with the egotism and self-obsession of the characters involved. The movie as a whole is a powerful evocation of a great Japanese classic. I highly recommend this movie who is in the mood to watch something eccentric, visually moving and stunningly beautiful.",N/A
565379,"I have read Frank Herbert's Dune series and waiting impatiently for it to be filmed. I got to see the David Lynch version--which Frank Herbert supposed helped create--and was stunned by its stiffness and gernerally proding story.  Years later, when the director's cut was released, the movie played a lot better...but not better than this version.This version is extraordinary. I have watched it 3 times and each time I reveal in the beauty and excellent story telling. This is the book come to life in front of you! The people contributing to the film are first rate. I enjoyed the character transistion of Paul--and this most of all made this movie click for me. Paul matured in this film version. He goes from spoiled only kid to forceful leader and hero.This version of Dune also brings to life the book's original narrator and observer.  Princess Irulan is wonderfully cast and this character's contribution to the overall story is fantastic.I wish the makers of this version consider taking up some of the additional stories of Frank Herberts Dune--ChapterHouse was by far the most thrilling and imaginative!I applaud SciFi channel for its original programming and willingness to take a SciFi's grand master's epic and turn it into quality visual entertainment!",Frank Herbert's Dune TV Miniseries  VHS
98831,"If you're expecting a happy camping trip in Deliverance, you're in for a surprise.I wasn't prepared for the sheer suspense of one particular scene.  It is so harrowing, it makes my stomach turn every time I see it.  I'm begging Boorman to cut away.  &quot;Go back to Burt Reynolds&quot; I'm yelling to the screen.  &quot;Let's see what he's up to.  It can't be any worse than this.&quot;  This is filmmaking at its most powerful.The story is a simple one.  Four friends head into the back woods of America - a place civilisation seems to have forgotten.  They leave their cars to a bunch of in-bred and very frightening looking hillbillies and head off down the river in canoes.  These back-woods are soon going to be the victims of an irrigation programme and the river and its surrounding population doesn't have much longer to live.The foursome's first forays down the river are fun, enjoying the challenge posed by the rapids.  They're exploring their animal instincts but failing.  Jon Voight, in one particular scene, attempts to shoot a deer and misses by a lot.  He's been away from the woods too long.Then, out of left field comes one of the most brutal scenes in movie history.  The four, instead of being under threat from the rapids are now under threat from mankind, including themselves.  It is up to Voight to cover up their crime, when the film's hero, Reynolds is shot down.  He succeeds or does he?The film's open-ended.  It leaves a lot of questions unanswered.

528214,"The Cell provoked a very mixed bag of feelings inside of me. first off, the visual style of the film is absolutly fantastic; rich and colorful and vibrant and complex and fluid. On the other hand, its violence is truely sadistic (the iron scene made me cringe and avert my eyes, but even that didn't help, the sound still reached me) and one wonders how much relevence it has to the plot other than to disturb. and thats another thing, the plot. the plot was probably thirty pages of actual story and seventy pages of visual descriptions. Sheesh, you know NOTHING about anyone (even Starger, the killer. His pysche is twisted to the point where you can't really tell for sure why he is the way he is) and in the end, care for no one. I'm not saying that The Cell is bereft of interesting ideas; there are a great many things that make this movie interesting, especially the small child at the end in a truely heart-wrenching scene that seems out of place, and the visual effects, sets, and costumes alone keep you watching, even if at times you don't want to. I'm saying that this is one movie where the current director should have been kept on for the visuals, and someone else hired to do everything else, because Tarsem Singh HAS NO IDEA HOW TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN VISUALS! the fact that there are a few interesting character scenes are a fluke. watch this movie once for the visual effects, and then forget about it and see movies with some real meaning.",N/A

219168,"When I first saw this film, as a preteen, I thought it was the ultimate romance. Well, I got older ... and saw it again. And it's still pretty romantic. In fact, it's still a film I watch over and over.The performances are really juicy. Everyone in it seems to understand the over-the-top quality of Tennessee Williams, and no one disappoints. You'll find Charles Bronson and a very young Robert Blake in supporting roles here. Both Kate Reid, as Wood's driving, ambitious `Mama' using her beautiful daughter to hook the town's men, and Mary Badham, as `Willie', the not-so-beautiful younger sister who idolizes Wood, are quite simply superb. Every move, every look from both are truly sublime.Natalie Wood has always been one of my favorite stars, and she is every inch the star in this one. It's clear from her first closeup how special, how different, and how exciting Alva Starr is to everyone she comes in contact with. She meets her match in Robert Redford, the man who has no dreams, who sees her in  unvarnished black and white but comes to appreciate her need to color life ... in fact, realizes he can't live without it when he's separated from her.Is it great drama? No. But it's glorious soap opera. The best soap opera, the most memorable Southern soap opera, you're likely to find. These people have real problems, real needs, and they're beautifully drawn by the screenwriters (thank you, Francis Coppola, among others) and by the actors who play them. We're given a lot of time to know them and care about them, and we do care, very much.It's one of my favorite guilty pleasures, and I expect I'll keep watching it for years to come.

Instead, you get musical numbers up the wazoo and stale comedy routines.This is not their worst picture -- &quot;Love Happy&quot; has that infamous distinction.  But, &quot;The Big Store&quot; is right up there in the flop standings.I have to agree with another reviewer, the Marx Brothers were getting old by this time and their energy level just wasn't there anymore.

47617,"&quot;The Shadow&quot; is something like Batman, Superman, the Phantom, and other comic superheroes, but on the other hand, it is very unlike them in that... I totally loved it!Alec Baldwin is Lamont Cranston, known as Yiinko in Tibet as a drug lord. He is one of the most evil and barbaric men there, until one day he is brought up to a strange priest named Tulku (Brady Tsurutani). Tulku tells Cranston that he must redeem himself by fighting crime and that he will teach him how to 'cloud men's minds'. Having no choice, Cranston learns from the priest. Seven years later, Cranston returns to New York City (of course it has to be New York City!) and fights crime. He is known to others only as 'the Shadow' because though he has the power of invisibility, there is one thing that he cannot hide and that is his shadow. The Shadow finds out that Shiwan Khan (John Lone), the last descendant of Genghis Khan, comes to New York. Shiwan had also been under the instruction of Tulku, to be redeemed from his evil ways but instead turned on Tulku, killing him, then using his new powers to his own evil purpose. And that is to conquer the world. He at first tries to have Cranston join him but Cranston refuses. Shiwan Khan uses the help of his warriors, a mad scientist Farley Claymore (Tim Curry), and absent-minded Dr. Reinhardt Lane (Ian McKellen) to create a bomb to destroy the city. But Shiwan is not the only one with help. Because with the unexpected help of the daughter of Dr. Lane, Margo Lane (Penelope Ann Miller) with her telepathic powers and Moe Shrevnitz (Peter Boyle), Cranston has a plan to stop Shiwan. But it will be difficult with Cranston's troubled heart and Shiwan's mind powers which may surpass even the power of 'the Shadow'.I'm very surprised that this movie didn't get very popular. There are many reasons why this movie is so wonderful. I've always loved good-looking Alec Baldwin, especially in his role as Jack Ryan in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. In this movie his acting and expressions are very good along with the acting done by beautiful Penelope Ann Miller, great John Lone, funny Jonathon Winters as Lamont's uncle, and everyone else. Except for maybe Tim Curry, I've never really liked him.Though some people may not like it for it being pretty corny, I thought that's what it made it so fun to watch! The action is cool, especially the end where Alec Baldwin hunts down John Lone with all the mirrors and glass in the room. The witty humor in it gave this movie also a right touch. I love the part where Margo Lane keeps interrupting Lamont Cranston because she can read his mind and knows what he's going to say. The music is just fantastic, giving the movie a creepy feeling to it. The cinematography and the gothic scenes also help.And I totally agree with everyone, the F/X were pretty terrific! From the really scary Fulba the knife, the shadows, Baldwin's blue eyes becoming black, the Shadow's invisibility, and the end where all of the mirrors shatter, these F/Xs will dazzle you. There's also the costumes which I was really impressed with with Margo's evening gowns and furs which were stunning and even Lamont's suits, the hat (especially the hat!), and his Shadow outfit. You know, at the end where Baldwin has the hat, the cape, and scarf off, his outfit really looks like Neo's in the movie, &quot;Matrix&quot; (Alec Baldwin looks so cool wearing this outfit with his chrome .45's in his hands!).Here are a few of my most favorite lines from the movies:(Lamont is staring at the lovely Margo while not paying attention to his Uncle Wainright) Uncle Wainwright: &quot;Why am I talking to the back of your neck?! Lamont?!&quot;(Uncle Wain talking about Margo) Uncle Wainright: &quot;What do you see in her?&quot;Lamont: &quot;Uncle Wainright, are you sure you're not dead?&quot;(After Margo keeps interrupting Lamont because she knows his thoughts) Lamont: Um, do you mind if I just get one tiny little sentence out here?&quot;(When Lamont starts to leave Margo) Margo: &quot;Hey, how will you know where I am?&quot;Lamont (mysteriously smiles): &quot;I'll know.&quot;Put it all together, you have a great movie which is entertaining and so much fun to watch!! A superb movie though very unrecognized, &quot;The Shadow&quot; will be one of my favorite movies to watch for a long, long time!",N/A
293467,"This film deserves to be in the pantheon of classic teen angst films (though it will really speak to adults reflecting on their years more so than it will for teens).  I think it's the best film I've ever seen in that genre (and is based on probably the best album that ever covered such ground).  There is real grit to the film, real emotion and pathos (but also a teriffic sense of humor).  The cast is also outstanding (why Phil Daniels didn't become a big star is anybody's guess).  But add to this the knockout soundtrack (from the ""Quadrophenia"" LP and other radio hits of the 60s), and you practically have a perfect film (I'm always hesitant to say anything is truly perfect).  But I wouldn't change anything here.  It is an unqualified success.It helps to understand the milieu of the film, so read up here on the mods and rockers so that you understand the time and place.

As far as I could see nothing stopped them from saying them (even God herself.  Jay's little tirade in front of her had me laughing so hard that fell out of my seat at the theatre).  I like characters who aren't all wishy-washy and who don't waffle around unless they have a character-changing experience.  Also, The issues raised range from the common (&quot;Is abortion right or wrong?&quot;) to the heirarchical (&quot;Is Catholicism stodgy and arcane?&quot;) to the silly (&quot;Do Bishops really bless their golf clubs for a better game?&quot;) to the divine (&quot;Is God a 'he' or a 'she'?&quot;).

I would point out some of the plot holes, but I'm still trying to figure out if there ever really was a plot in the first place. Sure the CGI graphics were interesting, but what's the point?There were what, a quarter million or so members of the 'Medjai' in that valley scene just waiting to go up against the Scorpion King's unholy army? Just take a few riders on a ridge over looking a valley, and paint in CGI replicas until you run out of room in the frame.Oh yeah, the DVD is also chock full of self-serving promo junk like stuff for the Scorpion King movie and some hokey-looking Universal Studios attraction. There's a commentary track, but I don't think I could stand to sit through it again.And the upcoming &quot;Scorpion King&quot; looks even better.....",The Mummy Returns VHS

It has got everything, action, ..., laughs and all with this self-depreciating smirk that is absolutely refresing in an evironment of too-cool-for-you hollywood [stuff].  Kurt Russel (who is an overlooked but extremely talented actor) gives a tour-de-force performance that holds the whole movie together.  Not many people would say this, but it is entirely his effort that makes this movie worthwhile.  His character, the inflated Jack Burton, is quite frankly a total loser.  This fact is entirely obvious to everybody but him and his persistance in percieving himself as totally cool despite all evidence to the contrary is what makes him so endearing.  Not only is he not cool, but he insists on proclaiming his coolness with this exagurated John Wayne swagger that ends up making a mockery of everything and everybody.  In the end, he does become sort of cool just by sheer force of will, it happens sort of by random and it is, amazingly, totally believable.  It seems perfectly natural when his coolness is achieved and acknowledged, and the inevitablity of this conclusion is summed up best by Jack Burton's own assessment, ""It's all in the reflexes!""",N/A

Another example of Hollywood's fetish with drugs, no doubt.  This has NOTHING in common with one of the most superior novels ever written (on which it CLAIMS to be based).

538804,"""Blow"" is a very good biopic on the life of cocaine kingpin George Jung (Johnny Depp) who rose to prominence in the 1980's as one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the United States.  The story is an interesting character study of Jung, who started selling marijuana to pay some bills and found that demand continued to outpace his ability to supply until he had built a cocaine empire.In an interview from prison included on the DVD, Jung states that the story was very true to actual events and that in certain cases it was like a flashback.  Jung appears from this interview to be a hapless soul who was willingly swept along by a riptide of forces that were beyond his sway, which is exactly how Depp portrayed him.Johnny Depp is an excellent character actor who relishes playing odd and offbeat characters.  In this film he gives one of his best and most nuanced performances with a clear understanding of the motivations and circumstances that spun Jung out of control.  He plays Jung with naivet&eacute; rather than giving him the sinister character that one might expect from a drug lord.  After having seen the interview with the real Jung it seems Depp was right on target.Penelope Cruz also expands her horizons, shedding her normally sweet persona to take on the part of Jung's shrewish, drug addicted wife.  Cruz plays the part with great force and emotion, like a woman possessed.  It is a fantastic portrayal of a bitter, self centered woman with a drug problem.Paul Reubens continues his comeback from the ill fated Pee-wee Herman days with a solid portrayal of Derek, the double dealing hair dresser who becomes Jung's primary distributor.  Rachel Griffiths and Ray Liotta also give fine performances as Jung's clueless parents.This character study is well written and sympathetically presented by director Ted Demme.  I rated it an 8/10.  It contains standout performances by both Depp and Cruz and is well worth seeing.",N/A
278289,"A picture-perfect modern-day romance that tells an exciting romantic story, &quot;Ghost&quot; is one of the best romantic films ever made. In it, we see just what lengths someone will go to for their love for someone else, and also shows us that the love we have for someone in our life goes on after death. Director Jerry Zucker, and acting by Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg, all make this movie a landmark that everybody knows about.What is so special about the story is the connection between the two romantic leads. Swayze plays Sam Wheat, who, with his longtime girlfriend Molly, is remodeling a penthouse apartment in New York, where they soon live together, completely happy and in love. We have no reason to question the love story angle because the direction and acting tell us from the very beginning the nature of their relationship, and does it in understandable terms. Sam also works for a major banking corporation, where he has a best friend Carl, who seems more than willing to take certain workloads off of Sam's shoulders. One night, Sam and Molly are set upon by a thief, who demands Sam's wallet, and after a struggle, Sam is left with a fatal gunshot wound. Of course, being dead, he is now a ghost, and must watch as Molly comes to the realization that her lover is dead.The acting of these two actors is what makes all of this incredibly affecting, most especially Molly's coping with Sam's sudden exit from her life. She keeps his personal things, as well as any little scrap of paper or memory she can hold onto, with Sam watching all of this from behind her shoulder and Carl trying his best to comfort and console her. Sam soon pays a visit to a con artist medium named Otta Mae Brown, played by Whoopi Goldberg, who is the only person that Sam is able to talk to. The comedy of the movie really picks up as we are given scenes of Brown walking in the streets arguing with the air, talking to the walls, and having hissy fits with Sam in public. Goldberg is really given a chance to shine in this role, playing out some of her best lines and material ever.Comedy then mixes with drama and action as the plot reveals that Carl was a mastermind behind a murder conspiracy. Carl is in desperate need of money, and when he found out that Sam was in charge of a four million dollar bank account, he hired a hitman to have Sam killed in order to try and take over the account and steal the money. As he further tries to worm his way into Molly's life, Sam becomes more and more determined to try and find a way of reaching her aside from giving Otta Mae instructions on what to say to her. Swayze is able to give us a powerhouse performance here, as his character sits back and can do nothing to physically protect his love. He feels weak, helpless, and these emotions are played out brilliantly.The film won an Academy Award, one of two, for Best Original Screenplay for 1990. The script is a melting pot of many different elements: comedy that comes from the relationship of Otta Mae and Sam's collaboration, supernatural elements stemming from the ghost angle, thriller techniques that reside in the mystery of Sam's death and Carl's intentions, and most important, the love story that Molly and Sam live out, which serves as the basis for everything that happens. It has a little bit of everything for everyone, which gave diverse audiences what they wanted and made it a sheer success among people.Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze both give excellent performances that keep the love story going. They both have a chemistry that never stops or staggers the film, but keeps it going. Whoopi Goldberg is Otta Mae Brown, a role she was born to play and for which she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her comic genius and diverse areas of acting play a major role, and sometimes become the heart of the film. Tony Goldwyn plays the conniving Carl, and does so effectively. He is one of those few people in a movie that the audience can truly despise for his crimes, and when the ending comes, it is pure satisfaction to watch him get what's coming to him.&quot;Ghost&quot; is nothing short of a successful movie, keeping us enthralled with comedic, romantic and thrilling elements, making us believe in things beyond this world. It never stops moving, it is utterly original, and it keeps us at the edge of our seats as well as tugging at our hearts.",N/A

529755,"This movie supports the argument to rent before you buy. The premise sounded intriguing enough; James Spader is a burned out  Los Angeles detective who had let serial killer Keanu Reeves slip through his fingers. Now, some time later and in Chicago, Spader begins to receive pictures of new potential victims that Keanu is &quot;watching&quot;. This sets off a cat and mouse game of, &quot;can Spader get to the girls in time before Keanu strangles them with piano wire&quot;? Oh, one more thing: Marissa Tomei has the thankless role of playing Spader's therapist, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out she's gonna be the ultimate victim. Here's the thing; I love a good thriller, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Copycat&quot;. This ain't one of them. It asks the viewer to leave all common sense at the door. When the city is alerted to the fact there's a serial killer loose, and they show a picture  on the news of his targeted victim (who works in a shopping mall photo shop),no one happens to call. Excusing the fact there are cops who know what she looks like streaming through the mall. This bit of celluloid pulp makes the Chicago P.D. look like the biggest group of idiots going. Eventually Spader and Reeves have what's supposed to be their big standoff, but the director has Spader playing it so cool we never fear for him. There's no threat at all so consequently no tension. Frankly I've seen more nail biting episodes of &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot;.There's also never any explanations of why Keanu is smitten with Spader. Just some quick speech about them being each other's &quot;yin and yang&quot;.

48897,"First off, I'm not much of a fan of Herbert's novel, ""Dune""; just as I am not much of a fan of the book ""A Clockwork Orange"". However in both cases I am a fan of the movies that were based on the literary works of the aforementioned, and feel that the films are actually much better than the books. That isn't to say that I prefer films based on literature more so than the literature itself - in the case of Tolkien's ""The Lord Of The Rings"", I feel no film can compete or be compared. That said the 1984 film, Dune, is as unique, intense, and brilliant a film as can be. Visually, this film is absolutely remarkable. I only read the book once, but this film really brought to life the images I had conjured. The acting talents are equally remarkable, and there are some big, seasoned names here. The special efects are wonderful, especially for the time of its release. The costuming and characters are fairly accurate to the literature, if not originally imaginative. The differences to the literature that are presented in the film work extremely well to complement the overall viewing within the time constraints, especially if one hasn't read the book. Even Toto's musical score (although I could've done without the electric guitar) is terrific. There is little about this film I dislike.I suppose the only draw back to this film would be that it may seem confusing and not descriptive enough in its story telling to certain viewers who haven't read the book - hence the TV version with deleted scenes and narrative added. Frankly, though, I really don't see what people find so confusing about this film. Read the book. I can tell you you'll be a lot more confused by the literature than this film! Besides, mystery makes for a much better experience.The big question I have about this marvelous film is how much responsibility did David Lynch exercise in his direction? I heard from a previous employee of Mr. Lynch's that David was called in at ""the last minute"" to piece everything together. The sets, storyboard, costuming, actors, production and effects staff, etc. had already been assembled ere he arrived. Hmmmm....If you're a fan of fantasy and science fiction, Dune the film is a must see, no matter who directed it.",N/A
71223,"Yes, this is a real gobbler of a movie, but it might have been okay if it were not just another vehicle for Arnold Schwartzenegger.  Arnold, whose emotional range goes from A to B even at the best of times, displays his complete lack of any acting ability at all in a manner that begs the question why Peter Hyams bothered to make the movie at all.  Someone else in the role of Jericho might have been able to make the picture work, but it would have to have been someone of the caliber of Spencer Tracy or perhaps Rod Steiger-- who plays a minor supporting role-- in order to do it.  Poor Mr. Steiger looks embarrassed to be in the film, as well he might.  The movie is an embarrassment to everyone in it.  Except Arnold possibly, and only because when one's only acting method is a gun, everything looks like a shooting range target.  Arnold shoots his guns a lot and grimaces, which is pretty standard.  That said, there are some things that do work fairly well in this movie.  Gabriel Byrne does just fine as the incarnate Satan.  He has some fine moments in the film.  He is pretty much the only one, however, who gets fine moments.  There is a great scene with Jericho and the  incarnate Evil One, where Evil tries to buy Jericho's cooperation.  It is totally wasted with Arnold as the tormented alcoholic hero, because Arnold has no emotional range, but one can see by Gabriel Byrne's attempts to give Arnold something to play off of, that almost any other actor could have made that scene work. One can see a structure there that had potential; alas, however, completely wasted.  Robin Tunney, the damsel in distress, does her best but there is no sense that she is in  desperate self-conflict.  This is absolutely essential to the emotional impact of the story, but it is completely absent.  She screams a lot and looks moderately fetching, and that's about it.  Although the pretense and the rationale for the whole story is contrived and silly, this in itself is not enough to make a movie a failure.  It fails because of the actors [Arnold the hero and Robin Tunney the heroine] and is a textbook example of how important a professional performance is to a film. Without it, a movie like this is all boom and crash, growl and magazine click, grunt and obscene finger gestures-- not worth your time or your money, unless you use it to study failure and learn from it.",N/A
476691,"Volume 10 of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; DVD series offers up one sure hit and one miss. There is a sense in which &quot;Arena&quot; proves how good Star Trek was, because, well, this is Captain Kirk fighting a guy in a lizard suit (and William Shatner is now 70!). After an unknown ship attacks Cestus III, the Enterprise heads off in hot pursuit. But just as they are about to attack both ships find themselves suddenly frozen in space by the Metrons, a powerful species that refuses to allow violence on their turf. Instead they will let the two captains fight each other on a barren planet: the winner goes home while the loser's ship will be destroyed. Thus Kirk comes face to face with a Gorn in a battle of agility and intelligence versus physical strength and endurance. True, the costume for the Gorn is rather simple, but we do learn the ingredients for gunpowder in this episode, so it has that educational side. This is certainly a memorable &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode. It is not on my personal Top 10 list, but it is close.On the other hand, &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot; is one of those great science fiction ideas that just fails to translate into an effective episode. The Enterprise comes across a strange craft and an agitated being named Lazarus, who claims to be chasing an evil enemy he must destroy. Lazarus insists Kirk must help and when the captain refuses, the strange visitor steals what he needs any way. When Kirk follows he encounters the &quot;evil enemy&quot; of which Lazarus spoke, he turns out to be some sort of &quot;twin&quot; of Lazarus and a very reasonable being. Apparently Lazarus' people have discovered a corridor between the matter and anti-matter universes. When the first Lazarus discovered he had a twin, he went insane. Even more alarming, if the two meet outside the corridor, they will destroy both universes. This would not be a good thing. I have to admit that this is one of those times when I think the logical thing to do would be to simply zap one of the two Lazaruses and avoid the potential destruction of absolutely everything. But that is just me and apparently Kirk was not going to learn this particular bit of wisdom until &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever.&quot; &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot; is long on talk and short on action and is a lesser than stellar Star Trek episode.

53154,"Although not quite as thrilling as his previous pieces, Martin Scorsese still scores with a ""Goodfellas"" goes to Vegas film.I put it this way simply because, part of the appeal is visiting with so much of the same cast as 1990's ""Goodfellas"". Robert DeNiro is our leading man this time, as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein a character based on the real Frank Rosenthal who'd been there, done that.  Joe Pesci plays an eerily similar character to his ""Tommy DeVito"" sociopath from ""Goodfellas"", as Sams associate with whom NO sane person should associate.Other fun ""mobster"" character actors like Frank Vincent are on tap too.  I personally think Frank is terrific, and has a wonderful presence and look with all that thick silver hair.  He reminds me a bit of Dennis Farina, another great actor who is far more famous.  Frank was classic as ""Billy Batts"" in ""Goodfellas"" and I enjoyed him here as well.  I wish we'd see him more often.The true original, James Woods, effectively plays the smarmy ex-lover to Sharon Stone's ""Ginger"", a Vegas hustler, who marries Sam (DeNiro) for his money and connections.  Love has nothing to do with this marriage as we soon see, when Ginger continues to love  Woods, and much worse.  Stone is believable, albeit melodramatic to the max, as she  entertainingly deteriorates in her marriage to DeNiro.  She deserved her award for this performance.Despite all the good factored into this film, something is intangibly missing here when you compare to ""Goodfellas."" That's why a ""Casino"", great as it is, is so similarly done and themed, it  seems to pale in comparison. I think if we didn't have ""Goodfellas"" to compare ""Casino"" to this one, it would stand out on its own as an original masterpiece.  However, since it's the same director, similar and terrific soundtrack used in the same fashion, nearly identical cast, and mobster theme...you can't HELP but compare!  You kind of feel like Scorsese said, well, it worked once, so let's change a few elements, give the movie a new name, and have ""Goodfellas Revisited.""If ""Casino"" had been first, would we think ""Goodfellas""  paled by comparison?

587512,"My wife and I saw this movie just last night and it was a very effective thriller, which is exactly what it was supposed to be. And let me warn everyone reading this that if you are a Ripper historian you will be dissappointed, you'd be much better off watching a Discovery channel special. The movie does present most of the murders and facts the way they actually happend but it's Hollywood and so they also changed a few things but, as I previously stated this was never supposed to be a documentary, if you can get over the fact that it's just a very well made thriller you should enjoy yourself emensely. Johnny Depp (Whom I didn't even like until I saw &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) is superb as Inspector Abeline and the man who plays the Ripper does an equally good job as well. In closing let me say that if all you want from this movie is blood and guts, you're likely to be dissappointed there too, because while there is plenty blood on hand (especially the Rippers) this movie also takes time to build it's plot too.  So if you want a good creepy story, I highly recommend seeing this, you won't be dissappointed.",From Hell

25155,"This visually stunning 1971 movie anticipates many of today's main social and environmental topics.At its core, Walkabout is about cultural dominance: the capacity of European culture to dominate both nature and other peoples. Central to this dominance - as the film indicates - are discipline (the girl's fortitude in confronting the outback), conformity to rules (her rote recitation and dress code), hierarchy (unquestioned obedience, even to a deranged father), subjugation of nature (wild animal slaughter), private property (the station in the outback, the despoiled mine), white privilege (the aborigine is useful and nothing more), but most of all, dominance requires replacement of instinct with institutions and nature with technology. Older viewers will recognize counter-cultural themes of the 1960's.Nicholas Roeg has organized these ideas in interesting ways that keep eyes glued to the screen. However, there is a real need to pay attention to the visual imagery which in Walkabout amounts to a dominant text, with the rather sparse dialogue acting as a subtext. Or put another way, in Walkabout Roeg is making a movie, not writing a play. Thus the opening sequence of imagery indicates reasons for the father's derangement and suicide, while crotch shots of the tree indicate the mating potential of boy and girl, a tension that is otherwise hard to convey since the aborigine boy speaks no English.Roeg's wise refusal to sentimentalize his characters gives the movie much of its strength. Instead, the main characters are treated in straightforward, non-judgemental fashion. Nevertheless, as other reviewers point out, the movie does make a statement. Namely, that the girl comes to regret her return to 'civilization', failing to realize at the time the natural paradise she had found on her walkabout. This rejection amounts to a telling commentary on the price the dominant culture has exacted from us in its demand for well-ordered 'progress'. While I agree with the spirit of the point, I think Roeg has idealized the contrast. After all, swimming, fishing, and roaming, look good from the standpoint of the closeted office in the big city. Yet millions of rural people to whom such simple pleasures are in some semblance available, leave those surroundings for the excitement only a big city can provide. In that sense, the girl's regret at movie's end can be taken as a coming to terms with the problems of modern European culture, rather than a return-to-nature as their oversimplified solution. Anyway, however you might choose to cut it, the movie is certainly worth a look see.",N/A

504162,"In a certain sense, as a Bach fanatic, I support anything that exposes kids to his music.  So my 1-star rating is a bit awkward in that light.  However, I think it well worth pointing out that the music of Bach needs no video embellishment to captivate a child's attention.  As a toddler, I was given cassette tapes of Bach's music, and listened to them constantly.  In a very real sense, from about age 1 1/2 to 6 I lived *inside* the Brandenburg concertos, preludes, and fugues, and the immersive experience has irrevocably enhanced and deepened my perception and enjoyment of music to this day.  So, consider allowing your child to focus on the marvelous harmonic intricacy of Bach without the concurrent distraction of an irrelevant stream of baby photos and implicit toy ads.  Who knows? Maybe (s)he will grow up appreciating such music as more than mere auditory &quot;scenery&quot; (to which category Baroque music has largely been relegated in American society).",Baby Bach VHS

Branagh got some of his friends together (you'll recognize many actors from his other films) and made this gem about an amateur theatre company putting on Hamlet at Christmas time!  The audition scenes are priceless.The script is excellent, the acting is wonderful, and--a rare treat in films--you will care about every character.  They all go through changes and become better people as a result of their time together.Michael Maloney is fine in the lead role of the director (playing Hamlet himself, of course; the comparisons to Branagh are unmistakable), and the rest of the cast give it their all.  A standout is John Sessions as the drag queen playing Gertrude. He has the most heartbreaking scene in the film.All in all, an inspired concept rendered beautifully.

It's such a good story, different, quite a diversion from the typical teen movies that are out there lately.  It is funny, heartwarming, and at times, serious.The film brings us back to 1983 - 84, and Sebastian Cole, played superbly by Adrian Grenier, wants to go on adventures.  He also wants to get out of school as soon as possible.  All the while, his stepfather decides he wants to become a woman, Sebastian's sister leaves and moves to California, and his mom leaves when she finds out her husband wants to be a woman.It is a little different and offbeat, but that is what makes this movie so unique.  The acting by Clark Gregg,who plays Hank/Henrietta is outstanding!  I've never seen him act before but I thought he played his characters with such great sensitivity and realness.  The performances by both him and Grenier, who I did see in Drive me Crazy, are truly beautiful and you can't help but fall in love with their characters.Sebastian is a great person who just wants to be good to others and along the way have what he calls 'his adventures'.You will have to watch to see what these adventures actually consist of.

456829,"Nosferatu unfolds like a languorous, disturbing dream.  The images have an hallucinogenic, archetypal quality:  mummified human remains in an ancient tomb; the figure of a woman sitting on a beach studded with tombstones; a dead sea-captain lashed to the wheel of a deserted sailing ship.Like Kubrick's The Shining, Nosferatu is less a standard genre film than a singular expression of a filmmaker's vision.  Writer-director Werner Herzog began with F.W. Murnau's expressionist classic, mixed in elements from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, then set about creating a meditation on the vampire myth.  What would it really mean to live forever, and be compelled to feed on the blood of others?  What of the unspeakable boredom?  The longing for companionship?  For normalcy?  For death?  As played by Klaus Kinski, Herzog's Dracula has spent hundreds, if not thousands of years alone with these thoughts.  He is the ultimate poster boy for German angst.  If not for the skill of his performance and Herzog's direction, he might have lapsed into self-parody.There are shots that all but reproduce moments from the silent classic - right down to the overwrought body language. But Herzog, Kinski, and the rest of the cast (including Bruno Ganz as Jonathon Harker and Isabelle Adjani as his wife Lucy) keep it in check and keep it beautifully stylized, so it all works.Probably due to the involvement of American studio 20th-Century Fox, Nosferatu was shot in both English and German versions.  Both are on this double-sided DVD; comparing them is instructive, since there are non-trivial differences in the visual construction of both films.  Most critics agree (and I concur) that the German one is superior.Finally, to get an idea of whether you will like this - or any - Werner Herzog film, take the Armageddon-Matrix test:  if you hated Armageddon because it was empty and overblown, but kind of liked The Matrix because of its ideas, then you may like Nosferatu.  If, on the other hand, you thought Armageddon rocked, but only kind of liked The Matrix because it was slow in places, then don't even think about it.",N/A

Several double-dealing events unfold and DeNiro and Reno soon find themselves alone as the only trusting partners in the ordeal, and begin digging up old government contacts to find their betrayers.

495447,"These days a concert clip passes for a &quot;video&quot; of a song, and very few artists take the time and trouble to make a video that is in itself a piece of art, further developing and enrichening the song it is showcasing.Michael Nesmith stood at the forecastle of the video ship, sailing her into port with the production of this comedy album/collection of video clips, &quot;Elephant Parts.&quot;  Yes, some of the comedy is a little dated; some of it is just plain silly.  But Michael never claimed it was anything more than silly; plus, amidst all the late 70's jokes you'll find the extreme timelessness of his opening monologue, discussing the fact that &quot;there's something funny about the gasoline prices!&quot; rings hysterically true today, as does &quot;The Large Detroit Car Company.&quot;  The words of his closing song, &quot;Tonite,&quot; also speak to a 2000's audience.Enclosed with these comedy skits are five of Michael Nesmith's video clips, some of the best videos ever made in a time when video was truly its own standalone art form--made by the pioneer of video art.  &quot;Light,&quot; &quot;Magic,&quot; and &quot;Cruisin'&quot; are all from Nesmith's &quot;Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma&quot; album (as is the above-mentioned &quot;Tonite&quot;), with &quot;Cruisin'&quot; being remembered fondly for its quirky lyrics and a young Hulk Hogan in his first major role.  &quot;Rio&quot; is from the album &quot;From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing,&quot; and was probably the first major video clip release (although groups from the 60's had been doing it since, well, The Monkees cribbed from The Beatles).  &quot;Rio&quot; is funny, it is thoughtful, and it is brilliant.&quot;Elephant Parts&quot; went on to become a short-lived NBC series called &quot;Television Parts,&quot; which would give some early television exposure to such luminaries as Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, Whoopi Goldberg, and Garry Shandling.Michael has a bizarre sense of humor, and you do have to be a fan to laugh out loud at his director's commentary (which we did).  It's extremely silly and delivered deadpan serious, and I do believe you need a steeping in The Monkees, Monty Python and some of Michael's mid-80's work such as &quot;Tahiti Condo&quot; (from the CD &quot;The Newer Stuff&quot;).  I thought it was hilarious, and laughed so hard it hurt.To be honest, I bought my copy direct from the source...-- it's cheaper here at Amazon, but Papa Nez will autograph it for you if you buy it from him.All in all, Elephant Parts is a classic -- nothing more, nothing less.  &quot;First Grammy for Video Music&quot; notwithstanding, &quot;Elephant Parts&quot; was the beginning of the video age, spawning M-TV and its subsidiaries, VH-1 and CMT and GAC and all the rest of them.

Now Nick can either learn from his new gift, or use it for his own selfish reasons.My Opinion:  This movie looks so good. The premise of Mel Gibson hearing the thoughts of women is really intriguing. The trailers are awesome. It's even really funny and interesting in the film. Until they have to wrap everything up and end the movie. That's when everything falls apart. The ending is terribly weak. It steals all the energy and laughter that it had going up until that point. It takes what should have been a really fun and entertaining movie and leaves it flat.

The Farrellys always had, until now, a good idea of what's funny, and if they can be gross and funny at the same time, well, that's even better.  But I didn't find anything funny about the prolonged shot of the defecating dog nor the placement of the chicken where the sun don't shine.  I think I only laughed aloud twice -- at the bit with the cow and at the sloppy wet kisses between the black dwarf chauffeur and Charlie's ex-wife.  There were other good moments but those damn promo trailers had already spoiled them.  I think the involvement of scowling corrupt cops in the plot was also a misstep.  Not only are the scenes involving the paper cut-out criminals incredibly dull, but just the presence of a menace in a Farrelly brothers movie is incongruously jarring, and as a result, I couldn't sense any of the sweetness that was at the core of their previous films.  Moreover, the Farrellys felt obligated to wrap up all the loose ends begotten by their ill-conceived plot with a stupid action sequence replete with an albino deus ex machina.  As for Jim Carrey, he is fun to watch, as always, especially in those scenes in which Hank and Charlie confront one another, which reminded me of the hilarious bathroom sequence in 'Liar Liar'.  But alas, he was unable to save the film.  I should also note that hockey fans may want to stay for the closing credits.

Enid and Rebbecca begin to drift apart, as Enid isolates herself more, hanging on to her determination not to play any part of such a facile culture, whilst Rebbecca is slowly forced by practicality in to compliance and submission.  Enid becomes fascinated by the pathetic Seymour (&quot;He's the opposite of everything I hate...&quot;) and a poignant relationship develops which becomes the focus of the film.Ghost World was a film whose course was very much charted during its filming - Seymour had originally been intended as only a peripheral character.  But the screen relationship between Birch and Buscerni was so strong as to encourage to director to change the film's emphasis completely.  The result is, by turns, halarious, poignant and its own way, tragic.  Zwigoff is clearly contemporary culture's worst critic and his view of America is as glib, if far more human , than that of Todd Solondz.  And its humanity which gets you here;  despite their flaws,  Zwigoff has genuine compassion for his ensemble of oddballs and its hard not to touched by their plight.The films end is almost epigrammatic in its ambiguity - the Ghost World of the title a sort of dream existence which both Enid and Rebbeca have spent their teenage years floating in, refusing to aknowledge a terrifying reality.  The ending suggests that whilst Rebbecca has left this world far behind, Enid has forever been lost to it.  Its an ending which, like the film, has a perculiar poetry to it.",N/A

I'm trying to remember, but I think when Wayne introduced the film at Nodance (in the Main St. Mall, Park City, UT), I thought he said it was shot on Hi-Def... I can't remember. Anyways, the plot is sometimes cliche-riding, but it's still a wonderful and sorta disturbing ride. Nice, nice stuff. Kinda like an audience-friendly Lynch rendition of a back-stabbing, twisted family noir made for tv. Still, it's darn good.",N/A

Now I wish Oliver Stone made a sequel just to depict what happened to the golden boys during and after october 1987. Of course ""Wall Street"" has its own flaws, but it's the best of the genre and the success of this movie relies much on the shark-greenmailer-two bit pirate-Michael Douglas's performance (if only Daryl Hannah knew how to act!): ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good, is right, it works... and it will save that malfunctioning corporation called the USA"".What I like most about this movie is that there's no shallow left or right wing propaganda. There's dad Fox on one side and Gekko on the other. It's up to you to see who's wrong and who's right; although I have to say Gordon Gekko may appear to be a much more interesting and charming character than all the others in this movie, as almost all the bad guys appear to be in the history of cinema.",N/A

But he does play that role well.  He's a jerk in Jerry Maguire, I don't think he really loves Dorothy (is that her name?).I like Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) much more, but that just might be because I'm a guy.  I think she's doing a wonderful job, although I never really understood why she fell for this Jerry Maguire hot-shot.  I liked her part because she was so dedicated to him and because she wanted to be inspired.The plot is good and there are some really funny scenes as well as a couple of heart-warmers.  Definitely a movie worth owning, you'll watch it over and over again!",Jerry Maguire

66398,Hitchcock knows how to build a sense of unnerving suspense aand with Frenzy all his prior knowledge makes this film one hell of a ride! A necktie murderer is having his way with the women of London and over the course of his deadly deeds more humor and inventive flashbacks are used to give the viewer an overwhelming sense of morbid pleasure! The film is shockingly violent but the story is so well crafted that you not only fall into its spell but at key moments realize you're in a nightmare! (...) Dark and dank corners and inter changing plot twists will leave your mouth open! The last 15 minutes have been copied to death but here is the original and the best. As it stands Hitchcock has made his most raw and violent film along the same vein as Shakespare's Titus!,N/A
539479,"This is one of the most enjoyable and halarious movies I have seen in a long time. I saw it the day it came out in theaters with my wife and 9 year-old-son. We loved the movie so much we went to go and see it again the next day and enjoyed it just as much!  Shrek is a very likable and reluctant hero who is well-potrayed in the movie. His mannerisms and facial expressions are so detailed. Mike Myer's famous Scottish accent fits Shrek's personality so well. I am sure he will be around to star in a sequel.  Eddie Murphy simply steals the show as Shrek's cowardly motor-mouthed side-kick &quot;Donkey&quot; who just want to be Shrek's friend even though Shrek would just like to shut him up in the worst way. Donkey is so funny in the movie! By the middle of the film, Donkey had me laughing so hard I missed little funny parts because my eyes were filled with tears from laughing so hard.John Lithgow was excellent as the prince with a Napoleon complex that does not escape the notice of Shrek and Donkey. Lithgow's voice fits the prince so well. His funny name will go over most kids head as will many of the jokes in the film( But there is still plenty left for them to get).Shrek is a fast moving adventure that leaves you begging for more but doesn't drag on. There is lots of action and some fairy-tale romance that the kiddies will appreciate. The computer generation is state of the art, dowm to a single blade of grass.  The only flaw in the film is that some of the characters moves like puppets sometimes( the princess mostly being the culprit). I do not understand how the animation with Shrek himself can be doe so well and not some of the other charcters. This little quirk could never tarnish the beauty of this film. Film-goers will just ignore it and enjoy the show, especially if they realize they have never heard their kids laugh so hard.Greego",Shrek VHS

465738,"That a film this incredibly profound and brilliant could come out of the lowest-common-denominator-driven politics of Hollywood filmmaking is nearly beyond belief.  However, I'm certainly not going to complain about it.The movie centers around a historical period of Shakespeare's life (the episode in which he is writing &quot;Romeo And Juliet&quot;).  The film includes many historical personages, such as the famous poet Christopher Marlowe and the stage actors Ned Alleyn and Richard Burbage [one of the most popular Shakespeare actors of all time].  The inclusion of Judi Dench (arguably the most famous Shakespeare actresses alive) as Queen Elizabeth was pure genius.The plot of the movie focuses on a love affair between Shakespeare and a fictional women (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) who turns out to be the perfect muse for S' writer's block.  The inquiry into what is the impetus for the creative output of the artist is fascinating.  In many ways, the movie reminds me of Thomas Mann's &quot;Lotte In Weimer&quot;;  in his novel, it is Goethe's talents which get put &quot;under the microscope.&quot;What makes this movie truly outstanding is that it's so well done.  It has the tone of a Shakespearian comedy - an utterly brilliant touch.  This movie could have so easily been a sham if left in the hands of a less capable director and inferior actors.  Paltrow's performance, in particular, really makes this movie sing.  The soundtrack gives the pace of the film a nice flow.Here is the type of tasteful movie that the cultured among us have been waiting for for so long.  Another movie like this won't come out for at least another 10 years.  The DVD also contains mini-biographies of the historical figures portrayed in the movie.  All in all, a can't miss.",Shakespeare in Love VHS
56328,"The main reason for reviewing this is simply backlog; I do enjoy Van Damme's oeuvre for the high comedies that they are, but this film really wasn't much of an improvement over 'Cyborg', which was possibly the worst film ever made (yes, that includes 'Hudson Hawk').Prior to release, Van Damme had been going around saying it will be a pure action film, returning to his 'Bloodsport' roots.  I wish.  For $20 million dollars cheaper, 'Bloodsport' makes 'the Quest' look like 'Best of the Best IV'.For starters, it's rated PG-13, so the action can't be all out--something we don't have to worry about when his films are rated 'R.'  Secondly, what little fighting there is only surfaces in the last 25 minutes of the film.  While as a director, Van Damme doesn't make many resolutely bone-headed mistakes, he should stay away from vanity projects like this one.The film itself is quite boring, and while it is amusing to see Roger Moore pick up his paycheck and run (it's been a hard life since 'View to a Kill'), nothing merits buying this on DVD.",N/A

484590,"Okay, so the Epcot-esque finale is more fromage than homage, and is remniscent of the touchy-feely, ending of THE ABYSS.  But there' enough hard-SciFi realism to rivet the attention spans of most physicists.Leave no doubt in your mind, the worst Brian De Palma flick is leagues better than the best Michael Bey(Armageddon) opus.  If you thought that Armageddon was good SciFi, then I'm surprised you're reading this.  As a matter of fact...I would be suprised that you would know how to read, at all?!The plot, what little of it there is, concerns Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise who play astronauts on the 2nd Martian mission.  It would seem that Don Cheadle is the only surviving member of the first mission, whose purpose was, apparently, to build a bridge between the two peaks (wink wink to Monty Python) of Mount Olympus...or some such foolishness.But the plot, as in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, is secondary to the breathtaking visuals of the dangerous crossing from Earth-to-Martian-space the crew endures.  Without giving too much away, there's a frightening depressurization when the ship strikes micrometeorites just prior to Mars orbital insertion, and the ensuing action is gripping enough to hold fans jaded by most &quot;junk science&quot; space movie fare.",Mission to Mars

271299,"The first time I saw this excellent film (on PBS actually) I cried... shamelessly and a lot. It was a moving and touching story that illustrated the onset of the AIDS epidemic, and how it hit particularly the gay community. What is most illustrative and important about this film is that it enlightens one's awareness of the gay community. Real, enduring, and loving relationships are shown between people here, and there is nothing of the sensationalized or stereotypical drama one finds in many films of this kind. I found it to be a deeply emotional picture, and of particular note, the performances by Bruce Davison and Campbell Scott. It has been a few years since I last saw this film, so I have no idea if the story stands the ""test of time"". I do know that it had a profound impact on me when I was relatively young. I felt that, if nothing else, it helped to prevent me from stereotyping a group of people when society would dictate that stereotyping and discrimination were the only courses of action.",N/A
184624,"Not a whole lot is said in Le Samourai.  In other words the diologue is short.  But that is the main reason this film is so entertaining.  Everything is shown, not explained.  It is rare that we find this in film.  And it is even more rare to find it done this well.  So there is not a whole lot that should be said about this film.  As for the plot it goes as follows.  A hitman(Alain Delon) is hired to assasinate someone.  Things don't go exacty as planned and a manhunt on both sides of the law ensues.  That is about it, but hardly.  There are more than a couple fantastic scenes.  The attention paid to detail in this film is almost bar none.  The film was shot with very little light which seems to precipitate the tone.  And then theres Delon, quiet and poker faced, with his black suit, slick hat, and trench coat.  He is remarkabley engaging.  This is one of those films that just sort of reaches out and grabs you, but does not shake you.  Jean-Pierre Melville has crafted a simple film that becomes a complex film for it's hinging to detail.  And that makes it inexplicably watchable.",N/A

513495,"Although almost completely ignored when it was released in 1999, DICK is one of the funniest films of the last decade. In many ways, the film is a cross between the classic 60s comedy THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT and (of all things) ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but the result is completely original. Two self-absorbed teenagers in 1972 become involved (though all manner of coincidences) with the doings of the Nixon White House, and become key invisible players in the unravelling of the watergate scandal: indeed, they become collectively known to Woodward and Bernstein as the &quot;Deep Throat&quot; source.Sometimes the best kind of comedy is the kind you can't describe. Why it should be funny that one of the girls should fall madly in love with President Nixon--removing all her Bobby Sherman posters on the wall in favor of pictures of him, and fantasizing he sweeps her away on horseback on a deserted beach (&quot;What about Pat?&quot; &quot;She understands...&quot;)--is almost impossible to explain, but hilarious it is nonetheless. Almost all of the humor in the film is to be found in the characters and the situations rather than in one-liners--signs of true comic minds at work.The pleasures of this film are best realized if you've lived through Watergate and the early Seventies (which may be why the film was originally a failure--it tried to hit the teen market), but it's just too funny a treat to pass up.",Dick VHS

Harry is a maverick cop fighting bank robberies, handling suicides and finally chasing a crazed killer known as Scorpio. The only thing we can determine that really drives Callahan besides Good vs Evil is that his wife was killed by an alleged drunk driver. It's the pre prozac and therapist era and Callahans controlled rage is only adressed through the mishaps of his villanous prey and his by the book department. In a sense this movie is timeless as hostage situations still affect our urban areas but with this cutting edge cinematic view we become somewhat disconcerted by our own laws and policies. The line made popular here DO YOU FEEL LUCKY? will last forever. Villan Andrew Robinson is still working today as he did a great job making us hate him in 1971.
