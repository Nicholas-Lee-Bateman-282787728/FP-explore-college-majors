336252,"This is a film that was unfairly maligned by critics, but demonstrates Bill Murray's tremendous range as an actor and the skill of a director who accurately and lovingly depicts a specific period of time i.e America circa 1917 and 1929; Paris during the 1930's, etc.  Murray gives the principal character, Larry Darrell, a disarming sense of humor that adds an extra dimension to one of Maugham's most beloved and perplexing protagonists.  The musical score is superb...far more polished than of many others produced in the last 20 years.  I only wish more films were made like this.  Supporting cast is equally good.....Buy the DVD and enjoy!",Razor's Edge VHS

This tape focuses a little more on the upper body, especially the triceps, but still includes great lower body segments.  I never felt I had much upper body strength until I had been doing this workout and &quot;Firm Cardio&quot; for about two weeks.  I saw more muscle definition in that time, but felt the results even sooner.  It is a tough workout so I really feel a great sense of accomplishment after I finish it each time.  It is good for those days when you really feel like &quot;pumping it up.&quot;",The Firm - The Firm Cross Trainers: Firm Strength VHS

The Predator is head huntin' again but this time he's packin' a wide assortment of tools. My favorite: The Disc-O-Death, super cool..When I saw this at the theatre, I was blown away and now I have it in a form that can stand repeated viewings. I must point out however, that the picture could be a little better, the makers of this DVD should of cleaned up the picture a bit, its not as crystal clear as it should be in my opinion. And the sound is merely OK. But its still worth the price.",Predator 2 VHS
611708,"Old School is a very funny movie that is a throwback to Animal House starring John Belushi.  The movie is about three friends in their thirties all struggling to realize that they're getting older so they start a fraternity on a college campus.  Seeing that they cause so much trouble and that many members don't even go to the school, the evil dean steps in and tries to revoke the charter.  Some scenes will have you rolling around on the ground in tears they are so funny.  The iniation with the cinder blocks, picking up the pledges, and the school spirit routine with Will Ferrell in the mascot suit are all hysterical.The cast for Old School is surprisingly good.  Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughan are very good together throughout.  Wilson plays the straight man although he has several funny scenes.  Ferrell is great through the whole movie as Frank the Tank.  His streaking scene and his inspirational speech, a la John Belushi, are two of the funniest scenes in the movie.  Vaughan's speech at Frank's wedding is also very good as he tries to convince him not to get married.  Juliet Lewis, Craig Kilborn, Andy Dick, and Sean William Scott all make basically cameos, but are all very good.  William Scott as a white trash animal holder is very good as Ferrell shoots himself in the neck with a heavy duty tranquilizer.  The Unrated DVD Special Edition doesn't offer much that is different from the movie that was shown in theaters.  Included on the DVD are the widescreen presentation, trailers, an outtakes reel, several deleted scenes and a feature length commentary.  This is a very funny movie that is definitely worth the purchase!",Old School

497093,"Great flick!!!This is one of the best movies from the 70s.  Kris Kristopherson plays ""The Rubber Duck,"" the leader of a truck convoy across the U.S.A.  The convoy communicates via CB radio.  For those of you old enough to remember, CB radio was huge in the late 70s.  When the speed limit on highways was lowered to an overly oppresive 55 mph, truckers (and most other highway drivers) snapped up as many CB radio systems as they could - they would communicate via CB whenever they saw cops.Convoy is all about these disgruntled truckers and their CBs.  Kris Kristopherson fights back against the cops and takes his convoy on a cross-country trip.  Kris is the most aggrieved of the bunch - Ernest Borgnine plays a cop who sets false speed traps just so he can harass Kris and give him tickets and grief.  However, one the convoy is set in place - nothing can stop The Rubber Duck or his cohorts - Pigpen and Witchy!!!This is a great ""feel-good"" movie from the 70s.  I highly recommend it!!!",Convoy [VHS]

721989,"This might not be for the faint-of-heart - this is the ""Hard R"" to NYPD Blue's ""PG-13"".  It aims for a greater degree of realism (or hyper-realism) in the detectives' interactions with pedophiles, murderers, drug traffickers than ABC's show can.For everyone who can take it - say, everyone who can appreciate the movie ""Reservoir Dogs"" (which might have helped to pioneer the level of machismo in entertainment that you'll see here) this is a hell of a show.The influences are obvious - this is about 50% NYPD Blue (the style of the show, and some of the substance), 20% The Sopranos (central figure is amoral by traditional standards, and brutal), 20% Training Day (which was also based in Los Angeles, and also concerned with the difference between being a wolf or a sheep), and maybe 10% Bad Lieutenant (the raw exploits of a corrupted soul).The show does a lot with those influences.  From the pilot episode on, it sets itself up with logic and precision.  We watch a group of characters interact in a series of games and conflicts, coming to understand all of their points of view, and not understanding how or if the conflicts between them will resolve.  Like ""The Sopranos"", this is a brilliant character-based show.  It's highly compelling viewing, and adds up to an interesting portrait of modern urban police work (and not a pretty one).",N/A
705263,"Everything about the Mighty Ducks is pretty much good. The characters, the plot, and even the music these movies are great. Though the Mighty Ducks are Disney films, they contain enough content to push a PG-13 rating. Still though, teens and adults should like these movies whether you are an ice hockey fan or not. Yes, the Mighty Ducks is mainly about ice hockey but all three do a good job focusing on the characters. I know that some people didn't give good reviews for the third movie but I think that was because it didn't quite carry the &quot;victory hype&quot; of the first two. Also, the third Mighty Ducks film is a bit different in the sense that it shows how the hardships of life and the bad decisions that follow can have an impact on the other people around you. Plus, the message of the third movie is that change happens throughout life and you must learn how to deal with it. So to sum all of that up, don't expect the 3rd movie to be exactly similar with the first two but do keep an open mind when viewing because the Mighty Ducks 3 is good for what it is. Without question, Mighty Ducks 3 ends the trilogy. I still wish that a 4th movie had been made following the events of the last movie.  By the way, I suggest getting the soundtracks for the 2nd and 3rd Mighty Ducks. It's ashame the first movie didn't have a soundtrack.",N/A

317774,"&quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; might just be a comedy classic.  There's nothing that unique about it; the (rather hokey) plot and stereotypes upon which the comedy is built are fairly standard.  Yet it's performed with such heart you can't help but love it.  Joe Pesci, Marisa Tomei, and Fred Gwynne carry the movie splendidly and earn every laugh they get.  This is one of those movies where you don't need the DVD extras to make it special (which is good, since there are essentially ZIP).  It's special all on its own.  At a price this low, you should definitely add &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; to your DVD library.",N/A

210442,"In 1981, Matthew Robbins directed and co-wrote the medieval fantasy &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;.  The film begins with an aging wizard, Ulrich (Ralph Richardon, who played Alexander Gromeko in the 1965 classic &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;), busily working on spells in his home known as Kragenmoor.  Living with him are his assistant/apprentice, Galen (Peter MacNicol, in his big-screen film debut), and his groundskeeper, Hodge (Sydney Bromley).  Visitors from the far away country of Urland come to Kragenmoor seeking help to rid their land of a fierce and aging dragon.  Their king, Casiodorus Rex (Peter Eyre) made a pact with the dragon years earlier that involves semiannual human sacrifices to the dragon.  The visitors are lead by an outspoken individual named Valerian (Caitlin Clarke, in her big screen film debut).  Initially reluctant, Ulrich agrees to travel back with them to Urland to do battle with the dragon, but more visitors from Urland arrive who are lead by one of the king's soldiers, Tyrian (John Hallam).  Following an altercation between Ulrich and Tyrian, Galen decides to travel to Urland to fight the dragon himself.The cinematography in &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; is often dark and bleak, especially with the scenes of Urland.  This creates an overall feeling of despair as that is how its citizens feel living in fear of the dragon and not knowing who the next sacrificial victim will be.  Filmed long before the availability of computer-generated graphics, the special effects in &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; are quite good relying upon Phil Tippett's stop-motion filming. The story is engaging, as are the principal characters.  Other memorable characters include Princess Elspeth (Chloe Salaman), Greil (Albert Salmi), Valerian's Father (Emrys James), Horsrik (Roger Kemp) and Brother Jacobus (Ian McDiarmid).  Some viewers may find the story slow, but plot twists and numerous suspenseful scenes (such as the selection of the next sacrificial victim, the scenes in the caves, and the ending scenes) make &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; a very entertaining film.&quot;Dragonslayer&quot; earned two Oscar nominations for Best Special Effects (Phil Tippett) and Best Original Music (Alex North).  Overall, I rate &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; with 5 out of 5 stars.  I applaud Paramount Pictures for releasing &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; in widescreen format (I had not seen it in widescreen since its original release in 1981) and highly recommend purchase of the film on DVD.",Dragonslayer VHS
59296,"Following up his then cult hits Halloween, the Fog, and Escape from New York, John Carpenter unleashed a brilliant re-imagining of the classic movie the Thing, going back to the original novella from the late 30's.  A study in isolation, paranoia, and severe distrust the story pits the crew of an Antarctic research facility against an amorphous, deadly enemy from space.  Like many of his films, I'm always amazed at how well the soundtrack contributes to the overall eerie effect, the pulsing heartbeat tones set against the howl of the winds makes for some very creepy moments.  There is also typically no announcing swells in the music when things are happening or going to happen, just the incidences in real time with their own sound effects.  The pacing in this movie is tight and just right, as action progresses from Kurt Russell and Dysert poking around the Norwegian research facility that the Thing escaped from, to the inevitable take over and slow disintegration of the crew.  The effects hold up pretty well after 20 plus years, partly because they're so organic in nature.  The Thing in its various forms with it bulbous human parts and rubbery effects dripping in KY jelly is still believable as it was then [although I didn't care for the stop-go-animation of the tentacles at the end as it grabs the plunger].  The cast is marvelous, and the extras in the DVD chronicle how they held together and bonded in the remote BC filming location, near a glacier.  This is a story that can scare on many levels, and the question of identity as horror is one that Carpenter would return to again with Prince of Darkness.  I think if it hasn't already, this film will eventually be in the pantheon of classic sci-fi horror, I certainly bought the DVD on that conclusion.  Recommended.",N/A
529562,"A lot of movies that are about drugs describe the substance and shows it's effects on the characters who use them. Here, Steven Soderbergh directs a movie that shows the battles, losses, and meager victories between the authorities, the two sided faces, and the people who sell and supply. A great plus about the film is that even though there are three stories to be told, and they do have some significance to each other. Soderbergh makes sure that you don't get overloaded or confused. Each part has enough to give, and every piece that follows comes one at a time. There are no sides taken to any situation, even though there are characters who obviously make seedy and corrupt decisions. You are watching it from a filmmaker who wants to bring you how it is: ugly, slimy, brutal, and quite exausting.Michael Douglas is more than fine as America's new drug czar. He later finds out that his own daughter, played by Erika Christensen, has succome to drugs herself. This makes an irony and brings a much larger pressure onto their household.Beninco Del Toro, in an excellent Oscar winning performance, is Mexican police officer Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, who along with his friend and police partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), find their clever ways of police work favoured by a General Salazar, who offers them work, money, and protection for helping him with his so called claim to bring down a major drug cartel.Meanwhile, San Diego housewife Catherine Zeta Jones is shocked to find her husband arrested, without knowing why, until their lawyer (Dennis Quaid) relenquishes the reasons, which will surprise her indefinitly.Everyone has a lot on their plate. And although we are sympathizing for Douglas' father and Amy Irving's mother as they try not to let their teen daughter slip further into susbstance abuse, there is an interesting take on the possibilities of what wrongs we are all capable of. Del Toro's character wants to do right, yet his police paycheque is such poverty, and the competing drug runners they apprehend for their druglord boss are large and powerful people. Javier and Manolo are good at what they do, so this new opportunity gives  them something they didn't have as Tijuana cops: excitement and more money. Now they are hotshots. However, an underlying guilt of it all haunts Javier like a ghost.Everyone here has more than a job to do. With such a field of excellent actors, from Miguel Ferrer as a cocky drug runner, Topher Grace as the unfixable punk Seth, or Benjmain Bratt in a terrific cameo as the head of the Obregon Brothers drug empire, they all make the film more interesting to watch, yet what I also liked is how nobody crowds the film and their time in front of the camera, considering the large number of actors and actresses there are.I really have to say that Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman as the duo of DEA agents who survey Zeta Jones's every move, are my favourite to watch. They aren't these crisp super hero agents you see in other films. They're simply a pair of the agency's best, remaining very relatable as real people, but very driven when their job takes them to the front of the action. And since they're friends, they also make some good funny moments, joking about this, or bickering about that, without turning the movie far away from any of the movie's purpose.The violence and substance abuse isn't way over the top, but when the drugs and guns do show up, it isn't pretty either. The story is really well written, and doesn't throw you around. It could have, considering the material's volume. I can't think of a better movie that has a lot to say and a lot to show without confusing you.A sombering low key soundtrack adds to the film's gritty and surreal mood. And the acting is terrific. There hasn't been a better ensemble of actors than in this film, and with the terrific storyline and directing, I hope they leave this movie alone from any sequal ideas or such. It said what needs to be said, and we'll know how things will go on after the film ends.",N/A
618017,"Quentin obviously thinks he's the most clever brat boy in Hollywood. How else do you explain the overbearing pop culture jokes all over this overlong, over-bloody cheeseball of a revenge flick? Lots of them are just stupid (the ""Ironsides"" theme) and then one of occasional brilliance (like the cereal box of Ka-Boom) to make up for it, but most are just of the overbearing clever-clever variety. And gory. REALLY gory. I mean, really really REALLY gory. Was this some kind of attempt to make up for the past 5 years of bloodless mega-fights (see ""Matrix Reloaded"")? The fight in the Tea Leaves room is nothing but severed body parts and so much blood that you imagine firehoses pumping the goo from just out of camera range as Quentin giggles with glee...""yeah, that'll make 'em squirm! More more! Hee hee hee!""Well, aside from the opening setting of The Bride in black and white and the anime sequence, there was little here to suggest that Tarantino was once being heralded as genius. In fact, aside from The Bride tracking down her ""kill list,"" there ain't much of a plot or development of character. Uma Thurman is stunning as the bride, however.

810521,"A friend of mine and I saw a sneak preview of this last night, and I hate to report that it was, dare I say it, incredibly disappointing. There wasn't a plot twist you couldn't see coming a mile away. There wasn't a bit of romantic dialogue that wasn't contrived. (Renee Zellweger's character, the best thing in the film, makes fun of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's romantic patter at one point, when he mentions that each moment with her is a ""tiny diamond I carried with me."") And every Southern accent, save Zellweger's, was absolutely horrid.The film, adapted and directed by the occasionally great Anthony Minghella, is a misfire. A maudlin, melodramatic misfire.At the point where movie stars turn up in what are essentially cameo appearances, I felt like the film was sorta cheating to try and keep us interested. Jude Law's character Inman encounters them on his travels, and, I swear to God, it felt like Dorothy encountering a new character on the Yellow Brick Road in THE WIZARD OF OZ. Someone new shows up, shows off and disappears. Look, there's Natalie Portman as a war widow! Look, there's Jena Malone as the ferry girl! Look, there's Philip Seymour Hoffman as a minister!Thus, half of Jude Law's performance is spent being the savior or straight man to a bunch of guest stars. The movie treats him like he's the only story element needed to introduce us to a series of unrelated vignettes.Though my friend had a real problem with Nicole Kidman's accent attempt in the movie, I must say that Kidman as Ada, when she wasn't spouting romantic cliches in voiceover or trapped in a truly ridiculous ending and epilogue, kept my interest. Her relationship with Ruby Tewes, Zellweger's character, is the most interesting in the movie. The film's at its strongest when the two are working together to keep her family farm alive.Unfortunately, they're also coping with town villains who show up on occasion to remind us that they're inhuman evil and completely corrupt. (The most evil one is, natch, an albino with blue eyes and long hair so that we'll know he's unique enough for us to blindly hate him.) They kill blindly without reason, whenever a scene requires them to do something hateful. Wouldn't it have been more interesting if they had been layered, human villains? The movie gives the villains basic motivations and then lets them run amok, showing up only when they're required to do acts of evil.The film shows signs of ambition. The actors are too talented to phone in their performances, yet their characters exhibit surprisingly little depth.And the romantic dialogue, all the yearning and hand-wringing, is straight out of a Harlequin novel. When you hear one of Nicole Kidman's voiceovers begin (and they start up the first one during the opening credits), prepare to count the cliches and eye-rolling statements.COLD MOUNTAIN is a historical romance in the vein of TITANIC, overwrought and badly written yet sure to be involving to those who like ""old-fashioned romance,"" no matter how badly done it is. This ain't DR. ZHIVAGO, sadly.It's not original. It's not different. It's not inspired. It's not even particularly involving.",Cold Mountain VHS
182502,"The Last Temptation of Christ is a splendid movie on all counts. Devout Christian hardliners should stay away though because the story does use quite a lot of poetic license - but it does justify it in many ways. Basically this film caused a ruckus among some Christian hardliners because Jesus has sexual intercourse in the film. ""Wait?"" I hear you say. ""Surely that kind of blasphemy should boast disapproval from every Christian worldwide?"" ""Neigh"" I say. ""You do not know why it is there until you see the film in its entirety.""The film is based on Nikos Kazantzakis' 1955 novel which caused such an outrage that the Catholic Church banned it and the Greek Orthodox Church excommunicated him. When Martin Scorsese released the film in 1988 the church stayed somewhat quiet but groups affiliated with Christian rights went spastic when they heard that the movie was in production. Universal who financed the picture arranged a private advance screening for some of these groups because of a fear that it could tarnish their image. The groups went nuts, starting demonstrating on the streets outside cinemas and Christian radio and television shows raved on about the blasphemous film nonstop 24/7 - so of course the whole world ended up watching it and people who knew nothing about it or never went to cinema ended up queuing miles around the block to see it.In short, God and Jesus are not mocked by any means. In fact they are glorified. Scorsese himself is a fan of big J and it shows in this wonderful and thoroughly engaging film that is probably Scorseses best work. Jesus is a lonely and psychologically disturbed carpenter who is alive during the oppressive regime of Rome. He has hallucinations which drive him to preach the new word of God. His performs miracles and starts a revolt against the system. He doubts his own abilities and confides in many dark secrets with his closets friends. The TEMPTATION in this film is Jesus refusing to acknowledge himself, always failing to become what he was meant to be. There is an excellent twist in this film which does grab you by collar and shakes you around. Very good indeed and nicely executed by Scorsese.There are some critics about this film but they are usually aesthetic in value, namely the New York accents and some of the dialog is very ""Down Town"" or ""Lower East Side"". Apart from that this movie is a wonderful experience and utterly compelling. A big thumbs up for this movie about the big J.",N/A

292396,"Some of the most interesting horror films come out of the often repeated urban legends that get passed down from one generation to the next.  One of the most popular concerns the one in which a baby alligator gets flushed down a toilet, only to wind up in a sewer and grow to monstrous proportions, gobbling up all those who are foolish enough to climb down a sewer hole.  In ALLIGATOR, director Lewis Teague took this basic idea, wrapped it around some truly cheesy special effects, hired some surprisingly competent actors, and delivered a scare film that is truly enjoyable to watch, even if not for the scare scenes as intended.  Robert Forster is a cynical cop who has lost partners before in his career, so it is difficult for anyone to want to tag along with him on patrol.  He is ordered to investigate a series of underground gruesome killings that he learns is the result of the by now fully grown alligator that has grown to its present size by eating growth hormones that had been dumped illegally in the sewer system by an evil magnate played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger.  It is this infusion of an ecological subtext that imbues ALLIGATOR with a weird blend of a genuine interest in the toxic waste controversy with a series of scenes that come perilously close to self-parody.  Forster is aided by a good-looking herpetologist Robin Riker, who serves as the love interest.  Much of the charm of the film resides in the special effects whose apparent cheapness is either the result of a tight budget or deliberate intent.  The alligator--who by the way is called Ramone only because Miss Riker as a child suffered the trauma of having her father flush down her pet baby alligator of the same name--is seen only either in head or tail profile or in full view but in a way that does not provide a sense of proportion.  Jack Carter plays a mayor whose sliminess is rivaled only by Ramone.  There are a number of interesting cameos by Mike Mazurki (the previous generation's stereotype of a heavy) and Sue Lyon, who twenty years before was Nabokov's Lolita.Much of the plot of ALLIGATOR comes right out of JAWS.  There is the outsized marine predator killing all who wander into its realm.  Forster is the Roy Scheider cop who has to tangle with the beast.  Robin Riker is the Richard Dreyful marine biologist who provides numerous scientific updates.  Jack Carter is the Murray Hamilton slimeball mayor who fears more about how Ramone will impact on his job than on the safety of his constituents.  And then there is the Hunt for the Beast led by Henry Silva, who takes on the Robert Shaw role.  Still, even knowing all this does not detract too much from what is meant as a scary movie that was designed more to parody true fright than to cause that fright in the first place.  Only the best of the parody scare genre can do this.  ALLIGATOR is one of them.",Alligator VHS  1980

786256,"When I first heard they were thinking about making a Freddy vs Jason movie years back in like 1994 I thought ""that's going to be awful"". Years later when it was finally done I admit that I actually like it.  It was done right. It's not overly corny  or silly ""like some Freddy and Jason movies"" . It's only problem is that it has the usual teenagers that can't act that you always get in slasher movies.The plot needs them in-order to work unfortunetely though. Although they are annoying it's clever that Freddy needs  Jason to bring terror back into Elm Street in-order to be able to kill again. You see, the people in Elm Street don't fear Freddy anymore because he's not around. So Freddy needs Jason to kill there so people think it is Freddy and fear his name again. So the more people Jason kills the more power Freddy gets and he can kill in dreams once again. I liked all that.When Freddy finally does get to kill in dreams again it's just the usual stuff with him chasing girls around a scary factory. The Jason killings are the same as you would get in Friday  the 13th movie as well. It's when we finally get Freddy vs Jason that the movie is at it's best. Freddy in Jason's dreams are very cool, makes you think ""now that is really going to piss Jason off"". Especially since Freddy makes himself look like Jason's mother and talks like her. That was very cool as well. Anyway their fight is well done even if it isn't that long. I hear they might make Freddy vs Jason vs Ash ""Bruce Campbell's character of the Evil Dead movies"". I'd rather see Freddy vs Jason vs Chucky so they could take turns hacking him to pieces lol. In that case though he'd only be in the first 10 minutes.",N/A

760317,"In A Man Apart, agents Sean Vetter and Demetrius Hicks are part of Los Angeles' best drug enforcement agency, which is currently making an effort to strike a massive blow at the narcotics pipeline between the borders of United States and Mexico.  Shortly after a successful joint mission in putting one of the most elusive drug cartel leaders, Meno Lucero, in jail, Vetter's home becomes the target of a ruthless attack that results in his wife's death.  With the name Diablo as his only lead, Sean must find a way to discover the identity of this mysterious person who is claiming Lucero's operation as his own, and to avenge the murder of the love of his life.While I appreciate the attempt at infusing some semblance of a plot into an otherwise straight up action movie, however, the effort is inconsistent and ultimately hurts the picture as a whole.  Rather than focusing on either giving the audiences an action packed adventure or a heart felt drama, what we end up with is a film that is average in both areas.  The gunfights in A Man Apart were poorly shot and chaotic, at times it was hard to tell the differences between the good guys and the bad ones.  The twists in the story made very little sense, and even though the romance displayed between Diesel and co-star Jacqueline Obradors is sweet, it really did not work for me or convince me of Sean's desire for revenge.  I also find it silly when movies have the tendency to suggest that criminals become more powerful when they are behind bars, if that is the case, what is the point of arresting them?With the exception of Pitch Black, I have never been a big fan of Vin Diesel's performances.  His monotone delivery of lines is often devoid of any feelings, and when he does exhibit emotions, frequently they seem to be forced and unnatural.  The same is true in his portrayal of the protagonist Sean Vetter.  This is largely the reason why the movie failed, if you are unable to make a connection with the lead character, why would you care what happens to him?Larenz Tate plays Vetter's partner Demetrius Hicks.  The two of them were good friends while growing up.  Their aspiration to make a difference in their neighborhood instead of complaining about it motivated them to join the anti-narcotics law enforcement unit.  There really isn't much to say about Tate, he did not make much of an impression in his scenes opposite of Diesel.  Timothy Olyphant, on the other hand, went way overboard as Hollywood Jack.  One minute he is a blubbering fool, another minute he becomes a cold-blooded killer, the discrepancies in the way the role was depicted demonstrates how poorly the whole film was scripted.A Man Apart is a derivative and an awful movie.  The lack of good action sequences, in combination with a superficial plot and paper-thin characters, result in a mediocre fare that was neither fun nor exciting to watch.  As for Vin Diesel, he still lacks that one defining role that has made actors like Stallone (as Rambo) and Schwarzenegger (as the Terminator and Conan) such big names in the genre.",N/A
694457,"In this starkly realistic examination of love and infidelity among the thirtysomething crowd from down under we learn that you may desire to cheat on your spouse, but it's better if you don't.Leon Zat, a police detective played with an original and striking demeanor by Anthony LaPaglia, cheats on his wife and finds that his adultery compromises not only his marriage but his performance on the job.  He becomes irritable and flies off the handle at things of little importance, and becomes consumed with guilt.He is not alone.  The marriage of John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) and psychiatrist Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) is falling apart as Knox seeks something from the outside and Somers is torn apart with the suspicion that he is having a homosexual affair, perhaps with one of her clients.  Meanwhile Jane O'May (Zat's adulteress played by Rachael Blake) finds that she needs a man, or maybe two, other than her estranged husband.  Even Sonja Zat (Kerry Armstrong) feels the pressure and yearns to feel attractive, perhaps with younger men.More than halfway through we have an apparent murder and an investigation during the course of which some of the adulteries come to light and cause the participants to examine themselves and their lives closely.Andrew Dovell wrote the subtle, richly attired script, full of penetrating dialogue and an uncompromising veracity, adapting it from his play Speaking in Tongues.  Ray Lawrence directed in an unusual but compelling manner in which the scenes are sharply focused and cut to linger in our minds.  Again and again I was startled with just how exactly right was something a character said or did.  Lawrence's exacting attention to detail gives the film a textured and deeply layered feel so that one has the sense of real life fully lived.  The cast is uniformly excellent although LaPaglia stands out because of his most demanding role.  His performance is one of the best I have seen in recent years.  The only weakness in the film is a somewhat lethargic start, partially caused by Lawrence's cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; scene construction and editing.  What he likes to do is lead us to a realization along with the characters and then punctuate the experience by lingering on the scene, or in other cases by cutting quickly away.  Often what other directors might show, he leaves to our imagination, and at other times he shows something seemingly trivial which nonetheless stays in our mind.  John Knox's affair, for example, is not shown.  Jane O'May and her husband's reconciliation is left to our mind's eye.  Yet the scene with Valerie Somers in the lighted telephone booth (with graffiti) is shown at length and then what happens next is not.  These are interesting directorial choices.The ending comes upon us, as it sometimes should, unexpectedly, but then resonates so that we can see and feel the resolution.  Not everything is tied up.  Again we are left in some cases to use our own imagination.This original film, one of the best of the new millennium I have seen, stayed with me long after they ran the closing credits.  It is well worth the two hours.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",N/A
612000,"What brilliant film!  I absolutely adored it!  Anyone who dismisses this film as a ""soccer flick"" definitely needs to give it a second look.  Despite it's soccer-themed title, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a fabulous and heart-warming story about family, traditions, friendship, love, fulfilling your dreams, and - yes - soccer (or football to non-US audiences).In the center of the story is Jessminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), a young Indian girl living in England who desperately wants to be a football (soccer) player.  On the one hand, she is incredibly talented, but on the other, she has very traditional  parents who believe that Jess should (a) go to university, (b) become a solicitor, and (c) marry a nice Indian boy.  But Jess has dreams of her own and when she is approached by Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) while playing soccer with the boys at a local park, she secretly joins Jules' local all-girls ""football"" team.  Jules and Jess become close friends but conflicts arise when both girls fall for the same boy - their coach Joe (the handsome Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).There are many, many highlights to this film.  First of all, it is incredibly entertaining and funny.  There are definitely parallels to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" as Jess' family life is thrown into chaos as they plan for her sister Pinky's ""big fat Indian wedding"" (complete with quirky, colorful relatives and friends). Secondly, it has a very talented cast led by newcomer Parminder Nagra (who is wonderful and earnest as the young woman in conflict between her dreams and her family traditions), the beautiful Keira Knightley (who will soon become a household name once ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" opens this summer), handsome heartthrob Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (rumored to be in the running to be the next James Bond), the hilarious Juliet Stevenson (as Jules' prissy mom who is appalled that her daughter would rather play sports than go shopping with her) and Shaheen Khan (as Jess' no-nonsense mom who is equally appalled that her daughter would rather play sports than learn the finer art of Indian cooking).  Thirdly, the production values, script and acting are top-notch, bringing to mind similarly quirky, enjoyable coming-of-age and feel-good films like ""Muriel's Wedding"" and ""Princess Diaries.""I honestly cannot find fault with this film.  I came into the theater without any pre-conceived expectations and came out loving it and wanting to see it again!  This movie is definitely on my DVD must-have list. I can't wait to own it so that I can watch it again and again.  Anglophiles, soccer fans and anyone who enjoys top-notch romantic comedies must see this movie.  It is a film that crosses cultural boundaries and will make you smile and laugh from beginning to end.  What a gem!",Bend It Like Beckham

734108,"Oh, boy. Just what I have been waiting for. ANOTHER buddy comedy with an interracial crime-fighting team.Yawn.I got back from I Spy about ten minutes ago, and I realized that I must right my review now before the (few) significant aspects slip through my memory and into the pit where movies like RUSH HOUR and BAD COMPANY go.Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy star as the klutzy boyish spy Alex Scott (could you come up with a more contrived Boy Scout name?) and black loudmouth boxer... uh... I forget his name. Kelly Robinson. It's sad that I forget, since the screenplay has Robinson repeat his own name over and over and over again. How is it, then, that I managed to forget it? Trust me, it isn't a memory problem.Anyway, Scott is the pushover of the spy world, always screwing up, both with spy stuff and in his social life. He is teamed up with obnoxious boxing champion to, you know, save the world. This time their mission is to uncover the location of a top secret stealth plane that can become invisible both to radar and to the naked eye. It has fallen into the hands of an evil Hungarian terrorist who is about to sell it to an evil Japanese terrorist, who will commit evil terrorists act with it.Scott and Robinson travel to Budapest to track the terrorists and take sdjjjjjjjjjjjjsd... *snort* Huh? Oh sorry. I fell asleep trying to describe the plot of I SPYThere are plenty of action scenes. And there are plenty of jokes. The problem is that the action scenes are routine and uninspired and the jokes aren't funny. No. Eddy Murphy isn't funny here, and neither is Owen Wilson. Oh wait. There is one genuinely funny scene where Scott uses Robinson's street-talk to pick up a sexy collegue (Famke Janssen, who was better in DEEP RISING).I could definitely forgive the film's tired, unimpressive action sequences if only the jokes were good, and vice versa. It simply doesn't happen. Owen Wilson has come a long way since he was swallowed by a giant snake in ANACONDA (yielding a post mortem appearance rivalled only by Jon Voight's) and has since almost become a Hollywood star. I don't blame either Wilson or Murphy for doing this project, because it certainly had potential. But their talents are wasted by the screenplay and ACTION-FLICK-101 direction. Wilson's normally-loveable bumbling charm is exploited to the point of irritation. Murphy is just plain obnoxious. The scenes in which they bicker incessantly are supposed to be funny, but they are so overblown that you can't even hear what either is saying. Which is just as well: I doubt the dialogue they are supposed to be relating is any more entertaining than the sound of their babble.I don't even feel obligated to mention that this is based on a 1960's TV show of the same title, because this movie has nothing to do with the series. It was a waste of money obtaining the rights to use the show's title and premise; besides the title, no one would have noticed the inspiration.There was no reason to make this movie, and if you have seen RUSH HOUR, BAD COMPANY, SHANGHAI NOON, or any other such movie, there is really no reason to see it. Just recently we had movies like The Tuxedo, and there will soon be NATIONAL SECURITY and SHANGHAI KNIGHTS.For a genre that was dead in the first place, it sure it taking a long time to die out.",N/A
666055,"Almost all diehard Simpsons fans (of which I am one) will agree that season one was up and down in terms of quality of characters, humor, entertainment value, etc. The animation was not as good as in the following seasons, and like in any series, the characters were not necessarily the same in the first season as they would become in the remaining seasons. Ned Flanders was mixing drinks and losing his temper and not acting as the passive Christian neighbor, Lisa was smart but much more bratty, Marge was more aggressive, Smithers was black, etc. There are some funny episodes the first season, but few that were as geniously funny as they would become once the characters and everything were more figured out. Of course in comparison to other shows, even when the Simpsons are bad they're better than 95% of what else is on television, but once you've seen how great they can be it's hard to settle for less.What's really cool about these DVDs though are the commentaries by Matt Groening, the animators, producers, etc. It's really interesting to hear different strategies they employ in creating the Simpsons (e.g., they try to never have a shot of them straight on, but rather at a sideways angle) and to hear them joke about different characters and how their characterizations developed (e.g. Smithers' homoerotic love for Mr. Burns). Although these will probably not be episodes you watch over and over again (at least now that the second season is out), any Simpsons fan should have it to listen to the commentaries, and just to make a complete collection.",N/A
784903,"An utter waste of time. Save your money. I saw this on the big screen at a second run theatre. As I LOVE vampire movies, this sounded so promising...a sexy, high-style love story between a vampire girl and werewolve boy. Well, the PR people deserve a bonus for coming with THAT hogwash! Be forewarned: this isn't ""Buffy"" and there is no romance here at all. I don't think the characters hardly touched, let alone have a ""love affair"". One minor character appears to have had an interspecies romance in the far past, but it's not gone into. Set in England (or somewhere), it's very hard to tell, but most of the Eurotrash looking actors have British accents.Every cool movie of the last decade is mined here -- the bleak, colorless noir of ""The Crow"", the wire-work stunts and long leather coats of ""The Matrix"", the kick ass action of both ""Blade"" films, the vampire ""king"" from ""Interview with the Vampire"" and every Anne Rice novel ever written -- but to absolutely no effect. What plot there is, is nearly incomphrensible. The general principles of vampirism or werewolvism are disregarded...werewolves change at whim, and both silver bullets and daylight no longer work as in traditional tales.Kate Beckinsale, a fine young actress, is wasted in this garbage. What on earth could have convinced her to take this part? At least she looks great, wearing Michelle Pfieffer's catsuit from ""Batman"". Every one else in the film is so pitifully incompetent that it would add further injury to even name them. Trust me, this won't appear on anybody's resume.By midway, I was nodding off. If I'd been at home, I am sure I would have fallen asleep. One boring shoot out after another, often with very unclear results. The ending clears up nothing whatsoever about the ""plot"", which is nearly nonexistent.This is one of the worst movies I saw in 2003, and possibly the worst vampire/werewolf movie ever made.

333410,"This film is finely made, but that confirms me in the idea that scientific problems are very difficult to deal in the cinema. In this movie the medical statement are questioned. The most simple people could get the idea that physicians are mediocre or interested persons, and this is so in some cases, of course.But there are much diseases so rare that were unknown and undetected owing to poor conditions of general health until practically 50 years ago when infantile rates of mortality were much higher than now, so mostly of these illness were simply ignored under a huge amount of deaths. The parents of Lorenzo love his son, but they -over all the mother- borders the thin frontier between reason and insanity. Of course nobody is exempt of this under extreme conditions, but she demands healing here and now when this is impossible. The doctors are seen under a potent magnifier lens, and I'm afraid at so close distance nobody is good looking. The physicians must treat not only Lorenzo, but also much other patients with another diseases, something that the family of these sick children are unable to understand, and so, this movie presents for me several questions: the barrier between perseverance and mental blockade, the necessity sometimes of resignation and the misjudgement and devaluation of the scientific method. Cinema has a big influence owing to his easy sentimental impact, but I think reality is hard and truly there are things out of reach of science of today and tomorrow no matter how much you love your family... or if not, we should to be gods, no vulgar human beings.

779916,"Compared to Secret World Live this is a very different concert movie with a completely different feel. There are many different camera views being used. Sometimes you're watching the show in the audience, sometimes you're soaring over the stage like an eagle and sometimes you're right there on stage with the band, just inches away from the face of a musician. Crystal clear professional shots are alternated with half-blurred home movie-like shots. Most of the footage is slightly dark, but this does create the right atmosphere.One of the most special things are the orange crew. Those who have seen the show live know that there's a small army of orange-clad crew members walking around and under the stage (re)arranging the stage settings during the show and filming the musicians for the big projection screens which hang high above the stage. Normally a concert movie goes through a lot of pain and effort not to show any other camera's or crew members. Not this one. You can actually watch the orange crew fully at work and the camera even dips below the stage every now and then to see what they are up to, making the concert movie sort of a documentary at the same time. The latter might not be to everybody's liking since it takes away a bit of the magic in the show. Personally I like this approach a lot since it makes you feel like you're part of the whole thing, much more than in the Secret World gig.For Growing Up Live there was basically one round stage and a round scaffolding which is lowered during certain parts of the show. Band members also move to different spots on the stage, which also has a rotating outer ring. Thereby the lack of space to move around compared to Secret World is partially compensated. Nevertheless, this show feels less dynamic than the previous one, but at the same time this creates a more cozy atmosphere. Bravely opening and closing the show on his own with Here Comes the Flood and Father and Son suits this atmosphere very well.The Barry Williams Show is the only song where a lot of tinkering with the footage has been done. Using lots of static, test images and control room switchboards the atmosphere of a TV show behind the scenes is created. Nice ! Less pleasing are the visual slow motion and split-second still effects in Sledgehammer which are a bit tiring to watch and soon become rather annoying.Instead of the often overused overlaid images this concert movie switches to split screen images every now and then with the upper part and lower part of the screen showing different perspectives.Another fine thing as far as concert registrations are concerned is the fact that in a Peter Gabriel show there's lots of rearrangements and new additions to songs, making it a new adventure from the audio side as well. And what about throwing in a brand new song, Animal Nation ? Surely not one of his best, but with some fine audience participation in the end section.Compared to Secret World Live the concert sounds much more 'live'. It was no big secret that Secret World had a lot of overdubs. This seems to be less the case on Growing Up Live. Still, this concert most probably has it's own share of minor 'cheating'. For instance, a song like Growing Up sound very different in the vocal department compared to e.g. Digging in the Dirt or Sky Blue. Then again, considering that it must me darn hard doing some decent singing while walking around in a big plastic ball I can live with this. ;-)I found the collective Secret World band tighter and better than the band for Growing Up Live, nevertheless there's a lot of splendid musicianship to enjoy. Also, unlike the show I saw in Rotterdam, the Blind Boys of Alabama actually join the band on stage for Sky Blue. And that's just one of the treats in this amazing show, all of which are captured on this DVD. Every song has it's own atmosphere and special effects or theatrics. The spooky little house hiding the drummer in Darkness, the egg descending from the ceiling in Secret World, Peter and his daughter walking on the ceiling in Downside Up, Peter walking on the rotating stage in Sky Blue, the camera in Barry Williams Show, the flaming globe in More Than This, Melanie in the boat moving around the stage in Mercy Street, Peter in the big ball in Growing Up, the little bike in Solsbury Hill, the transmission pillar in Signal to Noise, the lightbulb jacket in Sledgehammer, you name it.Another integrated part of the whole visual spectacle is the Italian audience, which is marvellous. I can see why Peter prefers to shoot his concert movies here. They are very enthusiastic, as one can see and hear during songs like Digging in the Dirt, Sledgehammer and Animal Nation.Whereas the concert itself was excellent, I found the DVD extra's to be quite disappointing. There's some still photographs of the tour, accompanied by an interesting ballad version of More Than This in the background. The 'making of' documentary The Story of Growing Up was rather disappointing. Not only does it feature some material that was already available in the sneak-preview on the Secret WorldDVD. It is also quite short (less than 10 minutes)Last but not least: the packaging. The DVD comes in a slip-case and folds open until you have the DVD with two booklets on each side, thereby displaying the trinity earth, moon and sun. The two booklets contain credits and nice pictures of the show and behind the scene. All done in a very tasteful way.To sum up: a great concert movie and some disappointing extra's. Still highly recommended because of the main feature, but adding up to a bit less than the Secret World Live DVD.",N/A

227912,"One of the halmarks of the Alien franchise is the use of talented, upstart new director - in this case, James Cameron - who scripted this film right after the success of 'The Terminator'.  Whereas 'Alien' was an exercise in the horror of isolation of space, 'Aliens' takes a turn into an action-war film.  Remembering that 1986 was also the year of 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket', it is no suprise that Cameron chose to insert plot lines that paralleled the Viet Nam experience (i.e., a technologically superior race ultimately gets in over its head against a much more primitive enemy).  With an excellent ensemble (Bill Paxton, Lance Hendrickson) that actually matched the original, the sequel actually worked well.What merits particular attention with this DVD is the inclusion of significant deleted scenes, which were left on the cutting-room floor because of time constraints (the movie was already pushing 2 1/2 hours).  The most important is a scene where Newt's family ventures out to the alien spaceship for a nasty surprise.",N/A
671543,"Reese Witherspoon stars in this charming comedy about finding ones' self and just being who you are. Directed by Robert Luketic, it is light-hearted and funny.PLOT SUMMARY: Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is your typical southern California blonde: she attends college, majors in Fashion Designing, and likes to get manicures. One night, her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), takes her out on a big date, and she and all her friends get excited, because they think he is going to propose to her. Instead, it turns out that Warner wants to dump her, because he'll be attending Harvard Law School in the fall and is looking for a more ""serious"" girl to marry, if he is ever going to become sentor. Heartbroken, Elle is furious and becomes depressed. But soon, Elle discovers that the only way to get her man back is to go to Harvard Law...a subject she knows little about. Elle is determinded to prove Warner wrong; that she CAN be smart. Surprisingly enough, Elle is accepted into the school. As soon as she gets to Harvard, however, she immediately stands out from the rest of the crowd, considering her wild fashion style and ultimate perkiness. But then, Elle has an encounter with Warner, and is surprised to learn that he has gotten engaged to a very preppy Harvard Law student, Vivian (Selma Blair). Vivian doesn't like Elle at all, and tries to make Elle's Harvard experience as miserable as possible, in hopes that she will find out that the school isn't right for her and leaves. Also, Elle is usually unprepared for classes (which also turn out to be miserable experiences), and Warner just can't seem to notice her. Meanwhile, Elle, upset with the way things are going, goes to get a manicure done and befriends the woman who gives her the manicure. This woman is lonely and depressed after getting a divorce from her husband and not getting a fair share in property custody. So Elle tries to help the woman get back what's hers from her husband. Also, while all this is going on, the woman tells Elle that if she wants her man back, then she must work hard to get him, so Elle decides to become serious with her work. She is surprised to find that she is actually improving, especially when one of her professors, Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), asks her, along with a few other students--including Warner and Vivian--to help him with an assignment. The assignment turns out to be a murder case. The accused? A former president of the soroity house Elle used to live in at her old college. Elle knows that the girl is innocent of the crime, but no one on her team will believe her. So Elle is determinded to solve the puzzle of the case and get her friend out of jail. By this time, she maybe starting to lose interest in Warner, for another guy has come into her life, Emmett (Luke Wilson), who is assisting Callahan on the trial.OVERALL THOUGHTS: I personally loved ""Legally Blonde"". The acting is superb by the entire cast, especially Reese--she ultimately shines, the script is clever and humorous, and is not offensive or dark. Since I am a Boston native, I have true appreciation for this film, since I'm always seeing preppy Harvard students whenever I visit Harvard Square (lol). The directing is awesome and it's just a fun film. You can enjoy it even if you are not blonde-haired! It's very girlie, but ""Legally Blonde"" will have you laughing away. The DVD is also nicely packaged, because the bonus features inlcude deleted scenes with introductions, exclusive featurettes, a Hoku music video, audio commentary, and trivia track.I highly recommend ""Legally Blonde"".Score:100/100A+",Legally Blonde

This was high school as I remembered it. I felt a lot like Jerry on many, many days of my frosh, and sophmore years. Confused, dazed, and staring longingly at the senior girls that only wanted the jocks. The fight scene is classic, as is the library ""domino"" scene, and Richard Tyson can really show everyone what screen presence is all about. Big Bad Buddy wants to beat Jerry's behind, and he is finally angered into accepting the challenge, after trying everything in the book, including bribery top get out of it. The best scene in the movie, is easily the book report. Jerry tries in vain to ruin a book report, and get detention by acting like an obnoxious jerk, and reporting on a piece of classic erotica. But his nice looking young teacher is so turned on by the book report about an ""Emmanuelle"" type character, that she makes out with him in class, to the shock of all the students, most of all Jerry. Jerry must have forgot that women love obnoxious jerks, and erotica! He lands up in many strange situations like this, and in the end, learns that confrontation is nowhere near as bad as anticipation.

754836,"Three years ago, in the movie, ""Almost Famous,"" Frances McDormand played a wise but overprotective mom who, at her wits' end, bemoaned the fact that rock stars kidnapped her son. Now, in ""Laurel Canyon,"" she turns the tables on that scenario, seizing the opportunity with great, obvious and sexy relish.McDormand plays Jane, a frisky, reckless, fortysomething music producer who strolls around her expansive Southern California spread in worn leather pants and an AC/DC T-shirt. She's a little like Sheryl Crow ... or at least what Sheryl Crow tries really, really hard to be.Jane, who starts her days with bong hits and Steely Dan, is having a fling with Ian (Alessandro Nivola), a singer 16 years her junior, and her lifestyle is hardly harshed at all when she's visited by her son Sam (Christian Bale) and his fiancee Alex (Kate Beckinsale).The couple is just out of medical school, wracked by premarital anxiety, and they are forced to move into Jane's rowdy house while Sam starts his residency and Alex writes her dissertation. Alex is studying ""the reproductive behavior of the fruit fly,"" while uptight Sam seems overtly depressed by the fact that his mom is cool enough to have framed photographs of herself with David Bowie and Iggy Pop.Couldn't such serious, studious kids find a calmer place to stay than in what appears to be a successful sub-franchise of the Hotel California? Probably. But then there wouldn't be a movie.As time passes and the lazy afternoons and pool-lit evenings add up, tension grows between Sam and Jane.  Sam starts to become attracted to a co-worker (Natascha McElhone). And Alex gravitates into Jane's world and starts to become attracted to, well, a couple of different people. And then things get really complicated.Unfortunately, things also slow down to a bit of a crawl.  ""Laurel Canyon"" was written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko, whose previous movie was ""High Art,""  a film which was also about a sultry, enigmatic artist surrounded by chaos and lots of chill-time. It, too, was slow-paced and atmospheric. But it also had several really strong performances pushing the movie along, and ""Laurel Canyon"" only has two - McDormand and Nivola, who are both excellent but must support a somewhat sluggish, underwritten movie by themselves. They almost pull it off.Christian Bale, usually a highlight in a movie, gets bogged down playing the moody, resentful son. It's hard to sympathize with a character who, when torn between Kate Beckinsale and Natascha McElhone (the definition of a win-win decision), can't get out of the dumps long enough to at least crack a smile.  He has to be the drag, the person who dislikes the most magnetic, charming element of the film.  So the deck is kinda stacked against him.Which makes me think: Maybe ""Laurel Canyon"" should've been the movie in which rock stars kidnap Frances McDormand's son. If Stillwater, the band from ""Almost Famous,"" had somehow dragged grouchy Sam off on their tour bus before he moved back in with his mom, McDormand could've had the entire movie to herself, and ""Laurel Canyon"" would've been a much more exciting place to hang out for a while.",Laurel Canyon VHS

15820,"The film gets 3.5 stars, the DVD 2. (Hey Wes, no commentary? You knew we'd be scrambling for Bottle Rocket once Rusmore was released...)This film is like a Wes Anderson dress rehersal. It has the same off-beat characterization, unique camera work, and moments of hilarity. But it's clearly Anderson's vision in the incubation stage--the film left me wanting, like watching a short that was unnaturally stretched to feature length.Owen Wilson plays Digan wonderfully, the man just not smart enough to become a master criminal. In fact, his entire view of the world is so contrived once senses that he was inspired to a life of crime by watching an A&E; special. His sidekicks are equally clueless, but lack Dignan's near-insane commitment to a life of crime.The narrative however is weakned by the love story, however charming and sweet. Luke Wilson's character--somewhat indecisive and melancholy to begin with--suddenly comes across like your typical schnook from a John Hughes movie.The strength of the movie lies in the Big Caper and all the planning (and botches) that precede it. James Caan was brilliant as the local boss and would-be kingpin, who tries to give the boys from Plano a little taste of reality.It reminds me a lot of another very funny, young Texan road flick: Fandango. But unlike this Kevin Costner predecessor, Bottle Rocket tends to wander, and lacks a lot of genuine emotion. Overall, it's a respectable debut film and is interesting to see the earlier fruits of Wes Andersons's creativity. As far as 1990s indie films go, you could do much worse...I recommend renting it first and watching it more than once before buying.",Bottle Rocket
277751,"&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is the brilliant spoof and satire of 'traditional' family life, set during the depression. From the narrative rose-colored memories of his own childhood, Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) reflects on the year when he desired nothing more than to own his own shot gun. Mom (Melinda Dillon), of course, is dead set against the purchase. Dad (Darrin McGavin) might be a bit more receptive to the idea, having just won a company sponsored contest in which the grand prize is a fish-netted stocking lamp. A slew of calamities ensue that perfectly and poignantly capture all of the clich? and kitsch of the period. Who can forget the incident at school where Schwartz?s (R.D. Robb) tongue gets glued to an ice cold metal pole on a dare, or the hilarious Christmas dinner scene at a Chinese restaurant? When Mr. Parker declares that he can?t eat the goose he?s been served because ?it?s staring at me? a diligent waiter produces a cleaver and promptly decapitates the bird right in front of the whole family.  Mmmm, yummy!  Truly, this is one funny film!Warner gives us an average effort in their DVD remastering of this film. Previously, ?A Christmas Story? had been made available in a full frame only edition with no extras. This time around we are given an anamorphic widescreen transfer but contrast levels continue to be too low and the colors, somewhat muted.

Disappointing - nevertheless.The author of the book - Jean Shepherd, reads his story as part of the extra features that also include a new documentary on the making of the film and some hidden easter eggs (how ironic - easter eggs for Christmas!) as well as the theatrical trailer and a generally benign trivia game.",A Christmas Story VHS

156647,"Every once in awhile I like to dip my toe into a David Cronenberg film. I have seen quite a few of them at this point, from some of his earliest stuff like &quot;Rabid&quot; to his seminal reworking of &quot;The Fly&quot; starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. One thing you will always get out of a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's viewpoint towards a synthesis of man and machine is always exceedingly grim, not to mention gory as all get out. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind never prevents them from charging into potentially damaging experiments. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs or messing around with human genetics may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. &quot;Scanners&quot; should fall into a &quot;Cronenberg 101&quot; class about these messages. Released in 1981, this film helped bring Cronenberg into the mainstream, as well as spawning a host of cheap sequels and a possible remake due sometime next year. Of course, this movie also provides the rabid horror fan with what is possibly the sickest gore scene in cinematic history.&quot;Scanners&quot; tells the story of Cameron Vale, a man who has spent most of his life in a perpetual fog. Roaming through the streets of the city as a homeless person, Vale suffers from a plethora of voices constantly yammering away in his head. He cannot hold a job or have a regular life with this problem, so he copes the best way he can by always staying on the run. During one of his excursions in a shopping mall, Vale overhears two women casting aspersions on his grubby appearance. The comments bother Cameron, who promptly causes one of the women to collapse into convulsions merely by mentally concentrating on her. Two thugs in trench coats lurking nearby notice Vale's little performance and promptly chase him down. When our hero wakes up, he is in the company of one Doctor Paul Ruth, a laconic chap who gives Vale the lowdown on what he is and what he must do. Ruth comes across as distant and slightly sadistic, but Cameron trusts him because the doctor knows how to make the voices in his head stop and is the first person to show a real interest in him.According to Ruth, Cameron is a scanner, a person with the ability to use a congenital form of telekinesis to manipulate other human beings. Ruth shows Vale that an injection of a drug called ephemerol quiets the voices in his head, which are really the voices of people around him that he picks up because he doesn't know how to use his scanning abilities. What Cameron doesn't know is that Ruth works for CONSEC, one of those evil corporations most movies seem to have nowadays, a company developing scanners as a weapon for governments and wealthy individuals. Moreover, Ruth initially fails to tell Vale about the presence of Darryl Revok, a powerful scanner who is building an army of these telekinetics, or how Revok just invaded the CONSEC building and killed six men in an attempt to discover exactly what new tricks the corporation has up its sleeve. Ruth then enlists Cameron to track down Revok and kill him. Along the way, our scanner encounters the beautiful Kim Obrist, uncovers the truth behind ephemerol and how scanners came to exist, and the true identity of Darryl Revok.Stephen Lack, the actor who plays Cameron Vale, carries out his onscreen duties with all the charisma of an ironing board. Some people claim that this is exactly the way a confused homeless man should act when confronted with such an awesome series of events, but I don't buy this argument. Lack gives a whole new meaning to the term &quot;wooden&quot; and the movie suffers because of it. Fortunately, Michael Ironsides as Revok, Jennifer O'Neill as Kim Obrist, and Patrick McGoohan as the strangely aloof Doctor Ruth make up for the lead character's ham handed performance. Of these three actors, Ironsides steals the show as the unbalanced Darryl Revok. Anyone remotely familiar with this actor's work knows he often plays the lead evil guy in dozens of films, and &quot;Scanners&quot; marks one of his best turns as a baddie. Without Ironsides in the cast, this movie would not be nearly half as good as it is.The most memorable elements of &quot;Scanners&quot; are both good and bad. The good is the gore, which tops most horror films on the market. The infamous exploding head scene at the beginning of the movie still makes me cringe. In fact, it ranks as one of those rare scenes in a film that actually get worse the more times you see it. The first time you watch the movie, you have no idea that this scanner's head will burst like a balloon. Subsequent viewings are worse because you know what's coming and the anticipation fills you with dread. The final showdown between Vale and Revok revolts as well. What doesn't work in &quot;Scanners&quot; centers on the sudden ability of Cameron to scan a computer system through a public telephone. I simply didn't buy this suddenly revealed ability, let alone that it would lead to the telephone booth exploding. Unfortunately, another drawback is the lack of substantive extras on the DVD. The picture quality is good, but I would have liked a commentary by Cronenberg to explain the philosophy behind the picture. Still, &quot;Scanners&quot; is a must see for horror and science fiction fans alike.",N/A

739520,"This is a powerful documentary which looks into the unsusually large number of gun deaths in the United States.  It had me in tears.  To see the extent to which fear grips the minds of Americans--fear of terrorists, fear of minorities, fear of the government, fear of being unpopular--the list goes on and on.  Moore makes the point that this fear is what drives the violence in America.  We're constantly bombarded with messages of fear from the media and the government.  For a comparison, look at Canada.  There are a large number of guns in Canada, but the gun violence rate is nowhere near the gun violence rate of America.  Why is this?Some may say that there is a lot of gun violence in America because we have a violent history.  Well, that theory doesn't hold any water.  Germany and Japan have had a very violent history (think of the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking), but the rate of gun violence in those countries is low compared with America's rate.  Also you can't say it's violent movies or games.  They watch and play those in other countries too.It's about time someone took on the NRA.  Perhaps the saddest scene is the last one in which Charlton Heston struggles to defend his views on gun ownership.  He just sticks his foot in his mouth and had to run away.  I really applaud Moore for his ability to chase down and confront these gun nuts.  You never know when they might snap and take a shot at him.  Let's use some common sense when dealing with this issue.  You really have to see this movie and think about this issue seriously.",Bowling For Columbine VHS

(Never seen THAT flick before, huh?)My two cents: I've gotta give writer/director Holland credit for inventiveness and guts: he puts it all out there. But... he puts it ALL out there, and for every bit that really works, there's one that really doesn't. David Odgen Stiers as the concerned dad is appealing; Kim Darby as the over-the-top mom is appalling. The foreign-exchange student routine works well enough; the drug-challenged best friend doesn't. Thumbs-down to the talking scribbles, singing burgers and the whole skiing subplot; thumbs-up to the Howard Cosell drag-racers, the over-achieving little brother and the endless series of guys wanting to hit on Cusack's ex.If you really want to see a five-star comedy about a disoriented kid with a suicide complex, check out ""Harold and Maude"".

After awhile its the characters you are interested in and not the dang CUBE they are in.CUBE 2 I just didn't have that connections.  Gerant Wyn Davies from early 90's good vampire (pre Angel) TV show Forever Night I liked cause he was familiar face, but in reality he became the same character as Quentin was in the first movie.

You actually appreciate the first CUBE a lot better.  Cube 2 wasn't a bad flick at all, its just a part 2 wasn't needed.

717483,"An enjoyable performance on DVD of Mozart's last opera in which he used Lorenzo da Ponte for the libretto.This is a 2-disc DVD set that stars Amanda Roocroft (Fiordiligi), Rosa Mannion (Dorabella), Rodney Gilfry (Guglielmo), Rainer Trost (Ferrando), Eirian James (Despina) and Claudio Nicolai (Don Alfonso).John Eliot Gardiner conducts this work that is performed before a live audience at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.The sets are simply magnificent with multiple curtains that depict beautifully painted backdrop scenes. The floor is entirely made up on plaques of inlaid stone to resemble an outdoor courtyard: a very realistic touch. The costumes are lovely and are appropriate for the era they represent. Also the cameral angles, switching and film editing are excellent and have resulted in a finished work that is of superior quality.That main singers are young, vibrant and indeed sexy: someone you could really believe to be in love and they all have great voices. They are competent in their acting skills making good use of hand gestures and facial expressions.And yet despite all the above positives things that I've mentioned above, I felt, for some difficult to explain reason, the first half of Act I dragged significantly (thus 1/2 star lost). I sensed the audience also had the same opinion, as their applause during this phase was rather subdued. However, this lack of energy changed quickly once Eirian James, as the maid, Despina, came on stage. She had an energetic stage presence that seemed to infect her fellow actors: While the other actors and actresses seem to enjoy their roles, she obviously loved hers and this shone through from beginning to end. From this point on, the entire cast seemed more at ease and appeared to be enjoying themselves on stage. The last part of Act 1 and the remainder of the work was lively, funny and a joy to watch and hear. Certainly the audience was much more responsive and their applause more sincere and prolonged.Technically, the disc has subtitles in several languages, including English and Italian, BRAVO!. However on the negative side, there is no menu that allows you to go to a particular scene: you have to start at the beginning of an Act and continue to jump forward one scene at a time(another 1/2 star lost). This is annoying and difficult to understand with the advances in todays recording standards.All in all a wonderful presentation: the negatives that I've mentioned above pale in comparison to the overall positives of this delightful work.

Besides, i'm sure many would think such a happy ending would be cheesey and a cop out and cetainly not justified, like a tv movie or studio ending to a fritz lang film. Hey we could have mary elizabeth hugging david, her smiling face raised above his head, freeze and slowly fade out. Like the poster says, Limbo, a state of unknowable outcome. I guess it is an ending that reads us rather than the other way round and i certainly prefer it to the utterly depressing and trite end to 'City of Hope' by the same director.",N/A
532998,"I was able to watch ""What Women Want"" free of charge.And that is the only way to watch it since it is quite disposable as a romantic comedy. This is one of those films the wife begs to see - if you catch my drift.Now I am not saying I despise romantic comedies. Great ones do exist. This is simply not one of them.The film starts out promisingly enough. The anti-Cary Grant character that Mel Gibson plays finds it necessary to clue his playboy self into what women want materially in order to keep up with the new female boss (Helen Hunt) at his ad agency. Due to a freakish accident (in one of the few genuinely funny scenes in the movie), he receives the gimmick of being able to actually hear women thinking. Blessed/cursed by this gift, he surmises that he can use it to get exactly what HE wants. Wronged by his new outsider boss who stole the position he was due, he subtly begins to undermine her career. But even as he does, he finds her to be more than he imagined, falling in love with her along the way. Think of it as an update of a film in the manner of ""His Girl Friday"".But where that film is a classic, this one is a lesson in how to suffocate a movie. Each minute of running time draws a noose around the neck of the film so by the time it ends its finale is impossible to write. In fact, this movie has one of the most contrived and poorly-penned endings in the history of romantic comedies. My wife and I just looked at each other and said, ""Aw, c'mon!"" To the director/writer, I simply give the advice that it is essential to make the audience buy the ending in any romantic comedy. She failed miserably in this regard and just killed the movie. Sadly, the DVD's commentary track exposes her own trepidations concerning the ending, but she never listened to those nagging doubts and the ending is a mess because of that.Oscar-winning actress Marisa Tomei is wasted in the film. Mel is often forced to do schtick while Oscar-winning Helen is simply lifeless compared to her turn in ""As Good As It Gets"". So much high-caliber talent, yet such torture to watch them flail within their caricatures. When you see the gears grinding, you know the film just isn't working.The DVD offers no great redemption, either. Usually a director's commentary provides some insights, but the director is so self-important it is hard to listen. I feel for the male production designer who joined her on the commentary track because she interrupts him mercilessly. I think the director's misandry is showing.So what rescues this movie from the dreaded one star review? Well, I'm being benevolent by giving it one more for the wonderful Astaire impression Mel does while dancing to ""Old Blue Eyes"". He also provides good laughs during his lame attempt to get in touch with his feminine side (just before receiving his supernatural ability.)In short, skip this one and buy something worthy like ""A Room with a View"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""Bringing Up Baby"", or ""When Harry Met Sally"".",N/A
195536,"This movie made by former Bond director Peter (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) Hunt and starring then 007 Roger Moore has all the hallmarks of a great fun action thriller. Yet, the action doesn't seem to truly pick up until the latter part of the movie when things start to go terribly wrong in a South African gold mine.The plot - for what it's worth - revolves around plans to increase the value of gold stocks by flooding a gold mine in Africa, and the machinations employed to keep the manager of the mine (played by Moore) suitably distracted and away from the location to allow the villains plot to succeed.A great cast supports Moore in this piece including Susannah York and Sir John Gielgud and it moves at a fair pace. The troubling aspect about this movie (and the reason I give it only four stars) is the poor treatment that has been afforded the picture on the DVD - it really does deserve to be redone and remastered.",N/A
731348,"I'm a fan of Madonna and her music, but her acting career is rarely hit, mostly miss.  I think ""Evita"" will always be her best and greatest role, and maybe she should have quit while she was ahead.I saw this film out of curiosity, because it didn't make it to theaters where I lived.  I enjoy films about being stranded on a deserted island, so I thought this might be worth a look.  As I watched it, I couldn't believe how incredibly bad it is, but I couldn't place my finger on what exactly was so bad about it.  I'm not sure if Guy Ritchie should be blamed for it or Madonna, but something with this movie is off.  With bad acting and a bad plot, this film is probably one of the worst I've ever seen.  On the DVD, the only saving grace is seeing a feature where Guy Ritchie and Madonna interview each other.  I wish that was offered on a separate DVD, because I'd buy that...and I don't want this film in my collection.  Its a film that should have stayed in the private collection of Ritchie/Madonna's home movies.  At the very least, I hope this film kills any chance that Madonna will be given another starring role in any future film project.  She's great in ""Die Another Day"", ""A League of Their Own"", and ""Dick Tracy"" but she can't carry a film (except ""Evita"") on her own.  I hope she sticks with her singing career and forgets about acting.Nicholas",Swept Away
68973,"What I like about this story is the way it is honest about the pain involved in stepping away from what is expected of you when you learn what to expect of yourself.  There is fear, doubt, and uncertainty, along with the roadblocks and setbacks life throws in your way via family responsibilities, health, and the jealousy and ignorance of others.And it shows the vital role of friendship, mutual support, and the belief of authority figures (the mother and the teacher) in finding a path to success in reaching our goals and dreams.  I find the relationship between the father and Homer particularly painful and am always happy to hear Homer finally tell his father that von Braun isn't his hero, that he is.  Jake Gyllenhall and Chris Cooper portray this loving but painful relationship very well.The Dad (the always great Chris Cooper) just wants to protect his family.  He has a world view limited by a harsh life and he has achieved some success in that world.  He wants to protect Homer and help him find his way in that world.  Homer has his views opened to something beyond Coalville and his father finds this to be wishful thinking and wasted dreaming without a chance of ever coming true.The movie is inspiring with moments of real fun and sorrow.  I think it is a great movie to watch with your kids and then talk over with them.  They will see things you don't and you can help them see things that they wouldn't otherwise see until they become responsible adults.I am glad that at the end of the movie they tell us how each of the Rocket Boys found their way in life.  Just a very fine movie and a neglected treasure.  I am very glad to have this DVD and enjoy seeing it again.",N/A
502871,For the most part I find many of the reviews about this film spot on.  This is not your ordinary movie and it's delivery is so unique that it just has to strike you as a masterpiece.  The subject matter for many of the story lines is so appaling in some cases that you are just compelled to watch and understand the feelings.  The director was not going for shock value but rather to portray things most refer to as disgusting and putting a human face to them.  I admit I found many of the scenes to be gross and appalling but you don't turn away fromm it instead you think about the characters emotions.  These are everyday normal people who just get caught up in the absurd.  The movie is so shocking that I believe everyone should see this movie even if it is very strong content.,N/A
606784,"I have to admire the writers of Matrix Reloaded.  They actually managed to create a film that has absolutely no plot whatsoever.  I've seen infomercials and music videos with more substance than this.  Now keep in mind, I like cheesy sci-fi movies as long as they are somewhat entertaining and clever.  What we have here is a movie written on the back of a cocktail napkin.  Just some of the problems...1. Never take your arch villain and replicate him hundreds of times (Agent Smith).  Not only is it silly and pointless, it takes away any menacing characteristics this villain may have had.2. Never endow your hero with superman-like powers.  If he can do anything, it takes away any suspense.3. Never intentionally obscure your plot with psycho-babble and cryptic references.4. Never make an excellent sci-fi movie and then follow it up with a peice of garbage like this.  People will no longer think you were brilliant, they will just think you got lucky.I cannot even begin to emphasize how bad this movie actually was.  The more I think about it, the worse it seems.  Because of this, I avoided &quot;Revolutions&quot; altogether and I won't even go near the DVD.Rent &quot;Equilibrium&quot; instead.  It is much, much better.",N/A
17931,"I first saw this movie twenty years ago. I could not stop laughing then and I cannot stop laughing now.Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray had perfected a deadpan comedic style by then that meshed beautifully with this script. Even in comedy, it is a stretch to assume that grown men would fight green monsters--and build a business from it- in the Manhattan of the 1980's. Sigourney Weaver plays off the male leads seamlessly as their client whose apartment is ground zero for the monsters. When you see her in this role, and think of her later one in Working Girl, you wish she had done more comedy throughout her career. Rick Moranis is hysterical as her neighbor, an accountant looking for a good time. I wish I had seen him in more roles over the past few years.Time has been kind to this movie. Yes some things are dated but that makes the film more enjoyable in many ways.The DVD offers a fun voice over track from the director and others. You learn a number of interesting things-Moranis was not the original choice for the role, for instance-and hear about how various shots were filmed in the Manhattan locations. You get the idea from the participants in the voice over track that these were their &quot;good old days.&quot; Even if you own the VHS, the DVD is worth the purchase for the voice over track and deleted scenes.I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy comedy, particularly of the broad and physical genre.

Hopefully it will be loaded with extra features never found on the rare VHS version from Vestron.The footage aboard the USS Nimitz is fantastic.

237266,"When your last movie and record take America by storm, winning Grammys and even an Oscar, Hollywood will give you clearance to do ANYTHING you want for your next project.  How else to explain the ego-driven mess that is ""Under the Cherry Moon,"" a hilariously campy feature directed by Prince?  His last movie, ""Purple Rain"" (1984), was no masterpiece by any standard, but it at least had energy and an often compelling storyline.  This 1986 followup, which has neither, was created to exploit, not nurture, Prince's celebrity as an actor.  His Royal Badness is Christopher Tracy, a playboy living in France with his buddy Tricky played by former member of the Time, Jerome Benton.  He crosses paths with a young lady (Academy Award nominee Kristen Scott-Thomas, in her debut role) whom he romances against the wishes of her uptight socialite parents.  The familiar plot probably wouldn't matter if this film weren't directed so shabbily. As a movie actor, Prince is the stuff Razzie nightmares are made of.  Like virtually all pop stars who appear in movies, he seems to think that posing compensates for a performance.  But what may work in a 4-minute music video can spell disaster when stretched over a 2-hour movie.  Kristen Scott-Thomas is one big exclamation point, overemoting and overacting with an exaggerated British accent (wait, I thought this movie is set in France).  The only redeeming quality is the music, taken from Prince's near-classic ""Parade"" album.  Beyond that, there's not much else to like in ""Under the Cherry Moon.""  Diehard fans may want to give this a whirl for its camp value, but if you're not already a fan of Prince, this movie will do nothing to change that.",N/A

541267,"Although in reality, this is a 4 star movie, when you tear it apart-the script is average, and there are too many scenes with the title character (Malena) walking through the town, getting looked over by men and boys of all ages. But I still can't give this film four stars.Why?It's such a deeply affecting and touching story-for me.I mean, this movie really struck a chord with me.The acting is subtle, and superb.The cinematography is very pleasing to the eyes, and it combines comedic elements with events so harsh they drove me to tears. No really, I was just hysterical, I literally could not watch, it hurt so much(I'm not gonna tell you at what parts though).So, here's a quick layout of the plot-It's set in small Italian village in 1940's Italy.And all around, all the talk is of the beautiful Malena(Monica Bellucci).Women do nothing but gloss her over with nasty gossip, because, duh they're jealous-She's young,beautiful beyond all comprehension, and all their husbands worship her.And men see her as nothing more than a mere sex object.The whole town talks about how she has all these lovers and is a complete whore with zero moral conscience.In actuality, she's actually a faithful, down to earth woman who does nothing more than  take care of her elderly father, and sit at home, awaiting her husband's(who's off at war)return. A scene which shows Malena dancing to a record with her husbands picture in the privacy of her own home works very effectively, not to mention offers a glimpse into her private life, one which you seldom get to see.It's all about what Malena is on the surface.You get to tell for yourself what Malena is really like.Anyway, so the short and short of it, is that what every one says about Malena is total bull, and depite her awe-inspiring appearance, leads a very lonely life. Women let their jealousy eat them alive, and don't want anything to do with Malena, and men do want something to do with Malena, but that only something is sex.Throughout what appears to be a few years, Malena experiences tradgedy of all sorts-her father is killed in a local bombing,she gets word that her husband died too, women at the market refuse to sell her food at the market, resulting Malena become the very thing she was once so unjustly accused of.And not to give away too much,but this results in that very scene, which is both haunting, shocking, and heartbraking.I swear, it tore the s&%t out of me.if that scene doesn't do something to you,stop reading this review right now, and go get a check up at the doctor's to see if you have a heart.This results in Malena leaving the town, and, soon you have the ending, which is both heartbraking,fragile, and true to life.It wasn't something blown out of proportion, or sugary sweet, it was just perfect.Fresh from a sobfest, I cried once more , but this time because I was so touched.But,let it be said, that Malena is not the main character in the movie, she is rather the base of the movie, what holds everything together, she's the theme, not the character.The main character is Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro).A young adolescent boy who falls in young lust with Malena, her mystery+beauty.Malena soon becomes the object of his every desire-She's in every daydream, every single minute of his day, and he follows her everywhere she goes, including her own home.He is the only one who actually knows the truth about Malena, all that happened to her, and is the only one who is able to see through the web of lies created by the town folks.Giuseppe turned in his role with poignancy,innocence, and maturity.May it also be said, that Malena(Monica Bellucci) barely speaks throughout the whole film, maybe in what seems to be 1 or 2 short scenes, and even then she only says a few words.And must I say, Bellucci played her role off her perfectly.Her face and eyes, expressions,actions spoke volumes and emotions, that I don't think words would've been able to convey.Just by showing a quick shot of her eyes, I was able to see, and almost feel all the pain,lonliness, and fear inside her.She's a gem, at least in this film.She's subtle,powerful, and fearless.One thing I also loved about this movie, was how little things were so close to life.For example,most townspeople aren't very attractive, and that's because they're not meant to be.I hate it when there's a movie full of beautiful people, you know it's not like that in real life.I loved it how Renato's (Giuseppe Sulfaro's) light acne wasn't covered up.Most every boy I can think of his age has some pimples!I loved it how Malena, despite her awe inspiring beauty, looked like a real woman, and not a cookie-cutter barbie!!She had curves, you know what I mean??I just loved it how the director kept all of life's imperfections in full view and didn't gloss them over with Hollywood sheen.It makes for a more effective and realistic film.In conclusion, I'd like to say, that I don't know if my review was helpful or not, but that it's been a long time since I've seen a movie with such depth and poignancy, one that touched me so deeply.Malena is a vastly underrated, exceptional film which deserves to be seen around the world.",Malena

It definitely comes from the Tarantino school of film-making, and since Tarantino himself has left his fans high and dry for several years, Amores Perros comes at just the right time.The film is gritty and brutally realistic and confronts the dark aspects of life that most of us choose to try to ignore. Our dreams and hopes for the future are fragile, and more often than not, are subject to come crashing down around us when the slightest unforseen event comes into conflict with them. Amores Perros is recognizing this uncomfortable truth about life and forcing us to recognize it as well. We can envision what we want to happen, but we must also be ready for anything to come along and blindside that vision.The film shows us this universal truth while seamlessly blending three different stories together, united by one chance incident. This aspect of the film also sheds light on the fact that even the smallest event in our lives can change us and our relationships with those we love forever. We aspire to reach the plateau of love, but seldom prepare ourselves for loss.Over the past few months, I have seen the two critically acclaimed films out of Mexico, Amores Perros and Y Tu Mama Tambien, and all I have to say is that Hollywood had better get its act together. Fans of intelligent, thought provoking film can find what they are looking for elsewhere instead of lapping up the mindless drivel that permeates too much of American film.",Amores Perros
775662,"There are always films that should never be tampered with or given a sequel. Or in this case, a prequel. The original film was a comedy classic that was best left alone. The warning signals also go off when this movie's paltry running time of barely an hour and a half is compared to the original's 110 minute run. Already that makes it sound quick and slapped together without much love or interest. And also, if you don't have any of the original players involved, then why bother at all?. Trey Stone and Matt Parker from ""South Park"", were originally going to do it, but then they backed out. What we got were no name writers and a no name director with not one redeemable value. While there is the presence of comedy genius Eugene Levy, and the always game Cheri Oteri, the rest of the cast were nobody's. Eric Christian Olsen, who you might remember from ""Not Another Teen Movie"" and ""The Hot Chick"", takes over for Jim Carrey playing Lloyd Christmas. He is the son of the school janitor and lives in the school. Derek Richardson takes over for Jeff Daniels in the role of Harry Dunn. He has an imaginary pirate friend and lives with his mom(Mimi Rogers). The movie takes place in 1986, and the film does give off that 80's type of look. The two boys run into each other one day, quite literally, and a bond is made. They become the quickest friends and Lloyd helps Harry at school because he has been home schooled up until this point. Levy plays the school principal, Principal Collins, and Oteri is the lunch lady. The two are having an affair, and set in motion what is to become what passes for a plot for this movie. Schools are being offered a large sum of money for having a ""special needs class"", and with this school not having one, the two plan to create a fake one in order to get the money and run. Naturally, Lloyd and Harry are the first two into the new class, and are then in charge of putting together the rest of the class. This means rounding up a number of goofballs and losers. The only familiar face in the bunch is Shia LeBouf from ""Even Stevens"". The boys get mixed up in the scheme, and with help from a lovely student, must crack the plan wide open. Yawn. This is the best they could come up with?. It took 9 years and this is what we get?. There aren't many laughs in here. Not many chuckles either. Olsen, as Lloyd, seems to be really game, and he is kind of impressive. There are times when it seems as if he is channeling Carrey, and it works. Most of the time. But while Carrey's Lloyd was a loveable goofball, Olsen's Lloyd is just a goofball. The same can be said for Richardson's Harry. Although the resemblances are pretty good. The jokes are not as frequent as you would have liked, and more importantly, are not really funny. The first film's humor and jokes and gags just seem to come naturally. The ones here seem forced and the scenes seem too photographed and planned. There are may gaps in the script as well. Why not delve into why Lloyd and his father shouldn't be father and son?. They could of explained that. There are too many flaws and stuff that just went downhill with no show of effort of even trying to succeed. They tried to live up to the ""toilet"" scene from the original, and while it failed, it was the one moment in the film that *might* give you a laugh, even though it goes against your better judgement. Bob Saget appears in an uncredit cameo, and his two scenes are the only two that made me laugh a little. It's nothing special, but under the circumstances, and with the cursing involved, and it being squeaky clean ""Full House"" Bob Saget, it made me laugh for some reason. If Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, and The Farrelly Brothers aren't involved, then there was no really no hope of this project becoming anything. It was tired, bloated with unfunny jokes and sight gags that were so uninspired, and was just a waste. It could of been something if certain people had been involved, but they weren't, and this film suffers because of it. Pass.",N/A

Or is he simply the product of an overactive and emotionally bereft young man.  Or in other words is he just a figment of Mike's imagination?Is he a manifestation of something?  An all encompassing force like death from which there is no escape?Or is the tall man simply a British actor named Angus Scrimm and there is no deeper meaning to the movie then that?You will have to decide for yourself.  I like to watch it from a different viewpoint each time.I also liked the cast/director commentary unlike in most DVD commentaries they actually tell you things that a true fan would like to know.

608345,"When I first saw Daredevil months ago in theaters, I bashed it as much as I could.  The idea of taking such a great comic character and trying to package it for global appeal just really grated my nerves.  However, after watching it for a second time, I have come to grown a bit of a liking for it.  Ben Affleck isn't bad at all as Matt Murdock who is lawyer by day and Daredevil by night.  Jennifer Garner is nicely cast as Elektra, and Colin Farrell nearly steals the entire film as Bullseye.  Director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson is a self admitted fan of the Daredevil comic (as is star Affleck) and it shows; the showdown between Elektra and Bullseye is almost directly taken from the classic issue of Daredevil #181, plus Marvel comics trivia knowledge is peppered all throughout the film, plus cameos from Marvel icon Stan Lee, writer Kevin Smith (yes, it's Silent Bob himself who goes by the name Jack Kirby in the film, named after another Daredevil alumnus), and the man who forever re-defined the comic series (and whose run on the series the film is seemingly mostly based from) Frank Miller.  While Daredevil does have it's share of good qualities, the film seems to have an uneven flow sometimes, Michael Clarke Duncan is miscast as the Kingpin (and no, it's not because he's black), the computer generated visual effects seem half heartedly put together, and the way the film ends just opens the door for a sequel and an Elektra spin off.  All that aside however, Daredevil didn't deserve all the bashing I gave it earlier, and longtime fans of the comic will appreciate most of the heart that went into the film, but might not like the complete package.  The DVD itself is nicely put together and the bonus featurettes featuring interviews with Stan Lee, Frank Miller, Brian Michael Bendis, Kevin Smith, and others is a must watch for long time Daredevil fans as well.",N/A
110956,"Released in 1970, OMEGA MAN is based on the book I AM LEGEND by Richard Matheson.  OMEGA MAN and Heston were proceeded by the 1964 LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price portraying the protagonist.  LAST MAN ON EARTH, as a side note, was admitted as an influence to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD by that films creators.  OMEGA MAN departs from the original story and the earlier film by eliminating the vampiric creatures lust for the flesh of living humans.  Instead, it is turned into a Luddite-like hatred for technology that drives the protagonistic society against one man.The society of vampires are also more intelligent than portrayed in LAST MAN ON EARTH, which is in keeping with the book.Well placed in late 60's culture, the story portrays the survivor (Heston) of a holocaust created by a biologically created virus used as a weapon.  All the survivors have turned into the night-dwelling 'Brotherhoood' (led by Anthony Zerbe); a technology- hating congleration of people infected with the deadly virus.  The virus is slow to kill some, and causes a disdain for light and the ability to see in the dark.  Eventually, all infected are subjected to death by the virus.Heston's character took the only antidote for the virus before it could be delivered.  He survives, and finds others who have not yet been infected after three years living on his own, barricaded from the Brotherhood who continually try to kill him as the last remnant of a hated past.This DVD's special features include an Introduction by some of Heston's co-stars and one of the screenwriters, a film- contemporary documentary about the making of OMEGA MAN, a Charton Heston Sci-Fi Movies Essay, theatrical trailer, and cast biographies.  It is subtitled in English French, and Spanish.  The spoken languages it can be viewed in are French and the original English.  A great film, and historically important as a post-NOTLD descendant!",N/A
125786,"Huh? What is this muddled piece of recycled Saturday matinee hutzpah director Frank ""wanna-be-Spielberg"" Marshall has tortured his unfortunate victims with? I know Hollywood is driven by an avaricious legion of money-grubbers ready to foist any plot-poor m&eacute;lange on an unsuspecting audience, but this must be the pinnacle of impudence!Anyway, this liberally adapted aberration of Michael Crichton's best selling novel follows an expedition into the Varunga region of the Congo by a disparate group of adventurers, each with their own agenda. We have the good boy primatologist (Dylan Walsh) who only wants to return Amy - a silverback gorilla with the ability to speak, via a computerized sign language device - to her jungle abode (I am feeling all warm and fuzzy). We have the high-tech gadget wielding Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney), searching for a lost team of diamond-hunters from her communications company. We have the Great ""White"" Hunter (Ernie Hudson), who, despite being black, manages to survive a Hollywood film all the way through the closing credits! Then there is Herkermer Homolka (say that five times fast), a paltering Romanian in search of King Solomon's Mines when he should be in search of a good face-lift. Played by Tim Curry, Homolka distorts his face into ungodly deformations that would make Jim Carry jealous! The clincher is when Curry says ""Every word of it was absooooluuuutely true."" Do not even get me started on his accent! Oh, by the way, our heroes run into some bloodthirsty, person-in-a-suit, killer gorillas along the way.As bad as ""Congo"" was, I still had fun watching the mishmash of cast members like the odd-looking Grant Heslov (he is always in these kinds of films), Joe Don Baker (reprising his role of a tough redneck for the umpteenth time), and the ever amusing, comic book hero-visaged Bruce Campbell! The acting and dialogue is embarrassing; my face was blushing for the actors. Director Frank Marshall may be thought of as a poor man's Steven Spielberg, but in this case, he is a dead man's Steven Spielberg. The pace of the film is non-existent, and there are absolutely no surprises to compensate for John Patrick Shannley's inane screenplay. Only lush African scenery and Jerry Goldsmith's crackerjack score deliver this turkey from the bowels of a one-star rating. By the time you reach the ""big climax"" (considering you have not pressed the eject button by this point), you are left wandering just what was the point - to use up a few excess rounds of prop ammunition, maybe? The celluloid that was wasted on this film could have been used to make a good nature film about REAL gorillas. Heck, gorillas themselves could have made a better a film!  The catch line for the film was ""Where you are the endangered species"", but it is boondoggles like ""Congo"" that should be on the endangered species list.",N/A
773872,"Although I am a big fan of the Transformers Series in general, there were several HUGE problems with Season Three that any true fan must admit, that prohibit it from getting any five star rating:(1) This season COMPLETELY destroyed the character of Grimlock!!!  Up through Transformers: The Movie, Grimlock was an awesome character, who usually stayed in robot mode, unless he had to go into combat, at which time he transformed into an indestructible T-Rex.  Somehow, by the start of the third season, he became a complete wimp who spent all of his time hanging out with a little kid (Daniel).  Plus, he stayed in T-Rex mode all the time (even when he needed to use his hands), and acted like a retard (as opposed to the brutish fighter he previosuly was).  I would've rather seen him die in the movie than what they did to him in the third season.(2) Season 2 completetly screwed up the perspectives of many of the characters.  For instance, why were Blaster and Soundwave, while in radio mode, suddenly the size of houses?(3) Carnage in C Minor ('Nuff said)(4) Total disregard for many of the characters who clearly survived the movie - Jazz (even though they stupidly show him in a race under another name), Cliffjumper, Inferno, Red Alert, Tracks, Hoist, Smokescreen, etc, disappear with no explantion whatsoever.(5) About a half dozen dozen different groups of robots, each of whom transform into a giant (OK, the toy line originally started this idea, but c'mon.  Devastator was awesome.  Superion and Menacor were cool.  Defensor and Bruticus started stretching it.  But things really got out of hand in season 3 with Predaking, Abominus and Computron being thrown into an already crowded mix)(6) And finally, even though Call of the Primates was a very well animated episode, what the heck were they thinking when they Unicron, the most powerful being in the galaxy, and reveal that his creator is a 4 foot tall reptillian punk????  No excuse for that dumb storyline.",N/A
734401,"What a nightmare. The producers wanted to create a claustraphobic feel to this movie, and they certainly have done that. Unlike other Holocaust films that I have seen, the gas chambers and ovens are shown working in full force instead of merely being hinted at. We get the experience that we are there instead of only reading about it. And the film gives added insight into the life of those who ""helped"" the Germans, but one wonders that even with a short life expectency it might have still been better to deny the luxury as a symbol of protest.The biggest turnoff to this movie was the conatant use of the ""F"" word. Whether it may or may not have been used to the degree that it was, it gave me the impression that the concentration camp victims were nothing but a bunch of godless men, more suited to the penal colony of Aliens 3. The constant use of the ""F"" word was a distraction, and I think there were Holocaust victims who did hang on to their dignity as best they could. Perhaps the Holocaust made athiests out of some Jews, but it also made believers out of some athiests, and this fact was grossly missing from this movie. Where was faith in Auschwitz? It was there, too, but so often Hollywood wants to present soldiers and others as being nothing more than animals whose only pleasure in life comes from raping the women and killing the men--just watch ""Dances With Wolves,"" and ""The Outlaw Josy Wales."" And according to this movie there were no decent Jews and no decent Germans. Still, the Holocaust was a nightmare, and this film captures it very well, and also shows how in spite of the demeaning circumstances, there was resistance.",N/A
332223,"Kubrick is not a genius.  This movie is proof of that.  To the average movie goer, and in fact, to many critics, this movie is as entertaining as a funeral.  However, for some reason it is trendy for movie critics to love anything Kubrick releases.  That is why this movie is so &quot;highly rated&quot;.  Is it because critics actually like it?  No.  It is because if they show favor for a film NOBODY understands, it makes them look and feel &quot;above&quot; the average person.  That is why this movie is highly rated, and why Kubrick, who is mediocre at best, is adored by the people who are &quot;in the know&quot;.  Like &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, this movie is only entertaining for someone on an acid trip.  So if you want to appear &quot;higher&quot; than the average man, you can go along with the crowd and say how great this movie is.

553201,"When Larry Hagman came back from acting purgatory to become a superstar as J.R. Ewing on ""Dallas,"" most folks saw this as being a big step up from being on ""I Dream of Jeanine.""  But Hagman's most pathetic moment really game with this 1972 film that he directed.  ""Beware! The Blob"" (a.k.a. ""Son of the Blob"") is both a sequel to and a spoof of the 1958 Science Fiction Drive-In class ""The Blob,"" starring Steve McQueen.  He is long gone, and this time it is Robert Walker, Jr. (Charlie X on ""Star Trek"") who gets the responsibility of fight the big bad blob.  The plot is essentially the same as the original.  An unsuspecting guy brings back a sample of frozen goo from Alaska, where he was working on the pipeline.  The goo thaws, starts with a fly, works through a cat, and then an entire family.  The devouring is witnessed which means the heroine, Lisa (Gwynne Gilford) and her boyfriend, Bobby (Walker) spend time trying to convince the local sheriff that a giant red blob thing is eating people.  Meanwhile the giant red blob thing is eating everybody, which pretty much means a complete cross-section of Seventies stereotypes.Hagman must have called in a lot of I.O.U.'s because Burgess Meredith, Dick Van Patten, Godfrey Cambridge, and Shelly Berman all show up to be consumed by the red goo (watch for Hagman's cameo as a bum).  If there was ever an attempt to actually make a serious horror film here, then it must have been abandoned early on in the production.  Very few of the actors seem to be taking this thing seriously and Walker just does not have the heft to be the manly hero.  As a horror film ""Beware! The Blob"" is not scary and as a spoof it is not funny beyond the sophomoric level of the decidedly lame.  The death scenes are not particularly creative, although the special effects are really not that inept, but you get the feeling some of these victims are happily throwing themselves into the giant red blob thing.",Beware!

765066,"Perhaps I was jaded because I read the book and was taken in by the complexity of the characters that Stephen King created, or perhaps I was anticipating that the movie would be a linear depiction of the events portrayed in the novel, but I was truly disappointed in this film.The movie, which does contain elements of King's novel, starts off by introducing us to four men, each friends to the others and each possessing the gift of ESP.  On an annual camping trip in the woods of Northern Maine, the men stumble upon a lost hunter, who is infected with an alien &quot;byrum&quot; which gestates inside him before being born in a graphic and bloody moment in the first third of the film.At this point, the story begins to become disjointed.  In the original novel, the alien lifeform was a bacteria, using host bodies to survive by taking control of them, implanting their own minds in the mind of their hosts.  One of the key elements of the book was that the alien lifeform was symbiotic, and genuinely needed human life to function.In the movie, the aliens are a monstrous collage of teeth and oozing worm, though monstrous and hideous, also largely unbelievable, especially when this &quot;worm&quot; emerges time and again from its host body, standing far larger than the man it has been hiding in.  This, amongst the many other obvious flaws in this film detract from what could still be an intensely frightening story.To its credit, it has some beautiful special-effects, created for the film by Industrial Light and Magic, a veteran effects warehouse known for producing the effects on such films as Star Wars and Jurassic Park.  The acting, too, is not a complete wash.  Morgan Freeman, a veteran actor of the stage and screen, takes on the role of a soldier with a vandetta against these alien invaders.  His character is unbelievable, as is most the film, but Freeman delivers a great performance despite the limitations of this script.I do not want to discourage anyone from seeing this film...as films of this genre go, I have definitely seen much worse, but for those who have taken the time to read the original novel, be warned that this film is a far cry from the nightmare Stephen King painted for us when he released this novel, a complicated depection of friendships and relationships faced with a horrific possibility of alien invasion.  It should be viewed with that realization that Lawrence Kasdan (who directed this film) was admittedly looking to do &quot;an (special) effects&quot; film.  He has, but as is often the case, effects take importance over story, leaving this Dreamcatcher blowing in the breeze.",N/A

544601,"After his two most brilliant movies (""Thesis"" and ""Open Your Eyes"", which ""Vanilla Sky"" was based off) Chilean-born Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar comes back with an eye-opener that will keep you at the edge of your seat. In a non-conventional script that reminds us of what a brilliant writer he is, he presents a family of three, a mother (Kidman in another impeccable performance) and her two kids, ""trapped"" inside a house, where the curtains must remain closed at all times to shut the light out, since the kids suffer from a critical condition that makes them fatally alergic to it. As three new servants knock on their door to offer their services, their lives take a weird twist that not even the savviest moviegoers can expect.The brilliance of Amenabar as writer and director is complemented by the music (also composed by him), which helps to set the tone for the normally dark shots. In the end, the movie opens up (like Amenabar has us used to) a whole can of worms, where life and death are inextricably tied to each other, and viewers are struck with the realization that truly we as humans have not yet learned our lesson as to how to cope with the deaths of our loved ones, much less when they happen under tragic circumstances.

584534,"I grew up reading all of the major (and most of the minor) Marvel comics titles of the 1960s and '70s... In the '80s, I drifted away, at first because the various titles had become so static and shoddy, and then later because the artwork had become so stylized and fetishistic.  By the 1990s, Marvel began to radically overhaul all its main titles, and the Hulk was one of the characters that they messed with the most. Because I never liked the hyper-realistic, overly muscular, overly defined artwork that came into vogue around this time, I was driven away from many titles. ""The Hulk"" in particular, started to have about a zillion rippling muscles that just don't exist outside of a bodybuilder's wet dream.  Still, every few months or so I would pick one up and see what was happening, and for a while I was able to keep up... I gather that around this time was when they introduced the goofy psychoanalitic aspects that define the screenplay of this film: all Hulk's problems stem from a bad relationship to his Daddy. (In the comic, the theme of domestic violence was much stronger and heavy-handed than in this film...)Anyway, as a Marvel loyalist, I've always checked out the various film adaptations, and while Hollywood invariably fouls things up somehow, I have to say, I was more impressed by this film than I thought I would be.  The special effects are fabulous -- I actually watched several of the action scenes over before returning the rental, and if I were still nine years old, I probably would have gone to see this movie in the theatres at least a dozen times. Why they have to muck with the original premises of these stories, I really dunno (the Hulk is no longer the product of an atomic bomb, but rather some sort of genetic testing...) but in general, as these things go, this flick was pretty good.  Mostly I am cheered by seeing such good, exciting special effects, onscreen action that finally matches the sense of wonder that the old Stan Lee-Jack Kirby comics could instill. My hope is that Hollywood will one day start cranking these things out with almost as much regularity as the comicbook industry itself, and as the making of these fantasy films becomes more commonplace, producers will eventually stop feeling the need to ""legitimize"" then by making the plots so overly complex and drearily serious.

767148,"Buffy season 5 was a nice return to the bad supernatural element (for those of us left feeling really empty after the lameness that was season 4) but also left a lot of feelings in the Buffy-verse just floating around.This was Buffy's last season on the WB, which is part of the reason why this season is one of the more melodramatic of the 7.  Nearly every episode had some tumultuously important emotional thing happen to Buffy (be it her new &quot;sister&quot; Dawn, the death of her mother, or at the end, Buffy's own &quot;death&quot; (yes, she dies again)) but really all that seems to happen with this season is the introduction of Dawn, and the removal of Joyce Summers from the equation that is Buffy's life.Glory makes a kick-ass villain, Spike once again saves the entire show (anyone else notice how boring Angel would be this year without Spike?), and Buffy sort of mopes throughout her life in a non-sensical manner trying to do what's right in her own eyes.  It's a very transitional season in which the characters  mature more than probably any other season and seem as though they are ready for anything, including the end of the series.  Which is why I was sort of disappointed with the outcome of Season 5.  The show was prepared for its own demise, and when that didn't happen because UPN picked it up, it seemed like they weren't really sure what to do with it.All in all, Season 5 has some great fights, some great maturing, and some great moments.

125039,"This is the first and, in my opinion, the best of the films based on Clancy's novels. It was directed John McTiernan who must have been especially busy in the late 1980's, directing Predator (released in 1987), Die Hard (1988), and this film two years later. There was some concern about Alec Baldwin being cast as Jack Ryan but he does very well in the part, generally holding his own with Sean Connery (Captain Markus Ramius).A few brief comments about Connery. It was in this film, I think, that he began to perfect his impersonation of himself, a tendency first indicated by his portrayal of Jim Malone in The Untouchables (1987) and then of Dr. Henry Jones in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). For years, he had portrayed a wide and diverse range of characters which include James Bond and King Arthur. He is thoroughly credible as each. And granted, it was not an easy task for him to play himself while wearing the uniform of a Russian submarine captain but much easier later when playing Richard the Lionhearted in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), John Patrick Mason in The Rock (1996), and most recently Allan Quartermain in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003). Of course, his voice-over work is also prominent in various television commercials. Connery is now the sole owner and proprietor of his own cottage (castle?) industry.In The Hunt for Red October, both American and Russian military forces scramble to intercept and then gain possession of the most advanced and most lethal of nuclear submarines whose location is essentially undetectable because of its stealth capabilities. Both the U.S. and Russia correctly see the Red October as a serious threat but for quite different reasons. It is Ryan's task to convince his superiors that Ramius wishes to defect, and then to convince Ramius that the U.S. government will allow him and his crew to do so.As suggested in the novel, the technological complexities of a Typhoon class submarine (especially one such as the Red October) are beyond the comprehension of most of those who read the book and/or see the film. Author Clancy does a brilliant job when providing only the information necessary for understanding why such a submarine poses such a serious threat. The same compliment must be paid to the five writers who presumably collaborated in this film's screenplay. The focus is correctly limited to the action narrative which begins with Ryan's initial suspicion and concludes when....Along the way, McTiernan carefully develops Ryan's relationships with his Pentagon superiors, with  Captain Bart Mancuso (Scott Glenn), and eventually with Ramius. I have always admired Richard Jordan's work and he is especially effective in the role of Jeffrey Pelt, national security advisor to the President. His several conversations with a Russian official, Adrei Lysenko (Joss Ackland), are memorable.  James Earl Jones (Admiral James Greer) and Fred Dalton Thompson (Admiral Painter) also make brief but significant appearances. Frankly, I was somewhat surprised by the quality and consistency of Baldwin's performance as Ryan. With all due respect to Harrison Ford, Baldwin would have also been effective in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger.This film offers great entertainment, combining high drama with delightful (always appropriate) humor. When first seeing The Hunt for Red October, I was among those who never doubted for a moment that thermonuclear war would somehow be averted.

767095,"My television passion used to be the X-Files. I watched BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER regularly but never made a huge fuss if I missed an episode or two. Season 5 of BUFFY changed all that.I hate to say it, but the unforgivable television ploy of introducing a younger character to keep a show fresh actually works for BUFFY. At least, it works in Season 5. Season 6 is a different story. Anyway, in Season 5, we meet Dawn, Buffy's new younger sister (don't worry - they will explain how Buffy suddenly has a young teenage sister in due time). A crazy fashion victim with wicked &uuml;ber-strength named Glory shows up in town searching for a key she claims was stolen from her. Riley and Buffy's relationship starts to go downhill. Buffy's mom, Joyce, gets sick, and suddenly Buffy finds herself in the role of caretaker. In one of my favorite developments on the show, Spike has a few revelations about himself and gets some intense character development as a result (""Fool for Love"", the episode where we learn the history of Spike, is one of the season's gems).Season 5 is a little slow at first, but once Joss&Co.; get the steam roller that is the season's over-arching plot going, it's arguably the best season of Buffy ever. As Buffy villains go, Glory is one of the more amusing. (I favor her second only to the Mayor from Season 3.) Dawn is annoying in that little sister way, but by the end of Season 5, I accepted her. (Of course, she starts to lose that acceptance with her behaviour in Season 6, but I digress.) Buffy and the Scoobies all take one more giant step away from childhood, and you can really begin to understand how this rather motley group has managed to save the world as many times as they have.And of course, there's ""The Body"". It is one of the most amazing hours of television ever to air. Joss Whedon trades the musical score for a haunting soundtrack of ambient noise and follows our gang around as they react to the news that one of their loved ones has died a natural death. It only covers a few hours of time in the Buffyverse, and there is no huge evil to overcome (well, one vampire, but hey, it's Sunnydale - that's just a normal day's work). The melodrama takes the week off,  and yet, if you have a sympathetic bone anywhere in your body, you won't be able to help crying at least once while watching it. (I always break during Anya's speech in Willow's room.)Other than a few key episodes, this is unlikely to be one of those seasons from which you get all your favorites, but at the end, the sum total will leave you feeling satisfied and glad you  hung in there for the long haul.",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season

23655,"Frederick Ashton's La Fille Mal Gardee, choreographed for the Royal Ballet in1960, is delightfully danced by the Australian Ballet. The Australians look pretty Royal Balletish with costumes and set design--typically English, not French--by Osbert Lancaster, and the dancing faithfully adheres to Ashton's style. The music, ""freely adapted"" and arranged by John Lanchbery, draws on tunes originally composed for the 1829 version of La Fille by Ferdinand Herold. Herold's music, in turn, ""borrows"" liberally from Rossini's operas: Lise's entrance in Act I is set to the ""Introduction--Piano, Pianissimo"" from The Barber of Seville; the storm scene in Act II incorporates music from La Cenerentola; and the aria, ""Bell'alme generose"" from Elisabetta, Regina d'Inghilterra, is featured in the ""When I'm Married"" pantomime in Act III. Lanchbery also ""borrows"" music composed by Peter Ludwig Hertel from the 1864 staging for the ""clog dance"" in Act II. (This 1989 Australian production is divided into three acts, not two as in the original English version.)Robert Greskovic, ballet expert and dance critic describes La Fille as ""sunny, funny, and fine,"" "" . . . a ballet of unhurried grace, delicate wit, and simple sweetness."" (For a detailed analysis of the choreography based on a Royal Ballet recording in 1981, see Greskovic's book, Ballet 101.) Adding to the charm of the ballet is Ashton's use of ribbon dances. We see Lise in the farmyard doing pirouettes and jetes with a ribbon. Later, she and Colas dance a pas de deux where a ribbon is wound and unwound around the dancers' waists as they do chaine turns en route to kisses; they end their duet with a ribbon formed into a ""cat's cradle."" The ""Maypole Dance"" in Act II has the villagers interweaving ribbons as they playfully cavort around the pole. One reviewer of this video notes that all this play with ribbons "". . . seems to go out of its way to mask the skill and talent of the truly excellent dancers . . . ."" These ""pas de ruban"" don't really mask the talents of the dancers. Their skills and talents are showcased with plenty of intricate footwork, big kicks and leaps, pirouettes galore, and a wide variety of steps by all the principals and the corps. Another reviewer, who says she is a Principle [sic] dancer with the Royal Ballet, writes that ""the dancers in this are exquisite"" and ""it has awesome technique."" The principal dancers are indeed outstanding. David McAllister (Colas) dances with precision and feeling and struts and bounds with athletic bravura. Fiona Tonkin (Lise) exudes sweetness but also exhibits stubbornness and petulance. Her acting is beguiling; her radiant smile is infectious. The two are superb together, skillfully displayed in various lifts. A very impressive ""chair lift"" caps off the ""Fanny Elssler"" pas de deux near the end of Act II, and McAllister airily skims Tonkin across the floor with very creamy ""carry lifts"" in Act I. Stephen Morgante plays the awkward and oafish country bumpkin, Alain. His antics are very funny as he attempts to woo and impress Tonkin's Lise with his ""dancing."" His moves are purposely stiff, angular, and jerky. He attempts to perform a double tour en l'air but manages only to make one-and-a-half revolutions and ends up with his back to the audience. In Act II, he partners Lise as she does two deep arabesques-penchees. With her working leg fully extended, he responds by throwing up a quick stiff-arm salute that parallels her raised arabesque leg. Sixty-four year old Ray Powell, in the travesty role of Widow Simone, spryly dances the ""clog dance"" to the delight of the audience. Ably accompanied by four unnamed corps de ballet women (all in ""sabots"" too) he does an English ""tap dance"" with myriad heel-toe steps and loud stomping feet.The VHS video recording itself is of mediocre technical quality. The images are sometimes indistinct and the colors somewhat faded. The State Orchestra of Victoria, under the direction of Noel Smith, admirably performs Lanchbery's score, but the audio quality is only so-so. This video needs to be transferred to DVD format. Nevertheless, it's a tape that should be part of one's ballet video library. I highly recommend it.",N/A

236892,"There are films that continue to haunt you long after the end credits fade away.  There are films that horrify you because of the gruesome imagery that bombards you while you sit in the darkened theater.  And then there are films whose haunting and horrifying nature is magnified even more because it is based on events that actually happened.  Such a film is Roland Joffe's ""The Killing Fields.""""The Killing Fields"" chronicles the journey of two friends who find themselves swept up in the revolution in Cambodia during the 1970s.  As the Khmer Rouge comes to power, New York Times writer Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and his assistant Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) witness firsthand the transformation of Cambodia's cities and countryside under the new regime.  As the situation becomes more dire, Schanberg finds himself in a difficult situation - he knows Pran will run afoul of the new government once the Khmer Rouge completes their takeover but Schanberg still needs him to finish his duties for the New York Times.  Both men hope for the best but when Pran attempts to leave the country, he finds that his window of opportunity has disappeared and he is trapped in Cambodia.""The Killing Fields"" is a film that pulls no punches.  Watching Pran trying to stay alive from day to day is a sobering viewing experience.  While its story explores the broader political implications of the rise of the Khmer Rogue, the true drama revolves around Pran who embodies the personal suffering of all of the regime's victims.  While Waterston is outstanding, this is a film that delivers it message through Pran, and Ngor is more than up to the demands of his role.  His performance is honest to the point of heartbreak.  This film is not easy to watch but it is a worthwhile journey for those with the courage to sit through it.",N/A

604427,"""Adaptation"" is slightly too self-absorbed, but it is heartfelt -- a deep, honest, funny, moving account of how we see ourselves in our lives. Here is a movie that celebrates change, and resists the notion that ""we are who we are"" or we are whatever someone tells us to be. There are thousands of movies that use that phrase, or a similar one, in the screenplay; ""Adaptation"" is a two-and-a-half film that proves it true.The performances are outstanding and the ride is unpredictable and hilarious. Charlie Kauffman's screenplay really does earn those tears at the end of the movie; it's hard to believe that he's poking deliberate fun but offering a profound lesson at the same time, but there you have it. ""Adaptation"" works on three or four levels, each satisfying in its own right.Spike Jonze is quite a young director for his ability to simply fade into the background. Visually, this movie is strikingly different from ""Being John Malkovich,"" but Jonze has an amazing command. He's extremely good with actors to boot, and Nic Cage is back in the kind of goofy, sincere roles he used to nail before an Oscar in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" somehow turned him into an action junkie.Meryl Streep just flat out acts her tail off, covering the entire rainbow of gestures and behaviors. And Chris Cooper' burrows deep into his character until he simply is John LaRoche.""Adaptation"" is funnier upon second and third viewings -- it's simply too good a mystery the first time to distract yourself too much with big laughs. The ""message"" loses a little steam, however, in subsequent viewings as well; the more ""Adaptation"" becomes a clever comedy, the more you see the gears turning, the more manufactured the emotions seem.But no matter.

The Wachowski brothers and their team have definitely outdone themselves on that score. The fight scene between Keanu Reaves and the hundreds of Smiths has to be one of the best martial arts sequences on film (OK, maybe not). The special effects are crazy, with Neo (Reaves) gaining superman like powers that enables him to fly, and bounce off walls like Spiderman. That isn't new but there are more such sequences in the sequel.The emotional attachment between Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss gets stronger and we see more of the human-side of Neo than we did in the Matrix. (I thought the sexual scenes in the film were unnecessary) Lawrence Fishburne doesn't fail to disappoint as the general with a dream who inspires the resistance. More characters are introduced like the twins with their crazy hair and ability to become temporarily invisible, the Keymaker, Jada Pinkett Smith (Morpheus' love interest) and the Chief architect...The extras on this DVD are excellent, check out the MTV spoof with Justin Timberlake and that dude from `Dude where's my car'.

349409,"A Professional Gun is a very good spaghetti western by Sergio Corbucci that suffers from a horrible DVD release.  The story follows a group of revolutionaries who are fighting the government during the Mexican revolution.  Fighting alongside them is a mercenary who has supplied them with and taught them how to use more advanced weaponry.  There is an uneasy alliance between the mercenary and the rebel leader that at times is very comical.  To make things worse, the army has hired a gunman to hunt down both men and kill them.  The movie on its own is very good with excellent action sequences, good characters, and another great score by Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai.  Fans of spaghetti westerns should check out this movie but stay away from the DVD.Franco Nero stars as Kowalski, the mercenary who sees a chance to make some money during the revolution.  He is good as usual with no complaints on my side.  Tony Musante plays Paco, the revolutionary leader who makes the uneasy agreement with the foreign mercenary.  Jack Palance gets top billing even though his part is rather small.  Even with so little to do, Palance gives another great performance as the villain.  Also, wait for the showdown at the end between two of the main characters, it should not be missed.  The DVD is absolutely horrible.  The picture and sound quality are brutal with very poor extras.  The one thing that is kind of amusing is the trivia quiz.  One of those things where its so bad its good.

Thundering bass, a bit booming at times however. Al's Telecaster sounds a bit thin, but Telecasters sound a bit thin, you know especially compared to Buck's beast of a rig. Song list is the best, I am so glad they chose ""Last Days of May"" as their signature  song, because it is done SO friggin good. Buck plays a truley great solo, and Al does a darn fine job, to boot. I actully read some review where this guy (""who's been playing 20 years"") thinks that Buck's playing has regressed, if you can believe that, take my word for it, the man is better today than he was 20 years ago, and that's saying a lot. After thousands of live performances and dozens of recorded efforts Buck doesn't need to prove ANYTHING to anyone but himself. I would crap a brick sideways if he suddenly decided to shift styles and start copping Van Halen-style licks, or worse yet become some twelve-bar-blues purist. Buck is Buck and his style is amazingly original. That alone puts hime above 95% of hacks recording today.  Eric's singing is a bit off key, but I've heard worse from others, it shows me that this release probably has little to no overdubs, which is remarkable in todays's age of digitl editing. And lookit, this was a one-shot deal, one-night only performance, and there is little wiggle room for post production editing to sweeten the sound or clean up missed notes. This has been the BOC way of live recording, warts and all. BOC has never sounded tighter or cleaner than they do in this release, and that's saying a bunch. I've seen then some dozen or so times and they always deliver the goods. I would give it four-and-one-half stars if I could.

203760,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window has a simple plot, an injured photographer becomes intrigued and enraptured with the comings and goings of his neighbors across the courtyard in his apartment complex and becomes convinced that one neighbor has murdered his wife.  The film takes place exclusively in the photographer's apartment and we merely can see into the neighbor's apartments through their windows.  The photographer, Jeff Jeffries, is played by James Stewart and due his broken leg is confined to his apartment and due to the inherent voyeuristic nature of his trade, he trains his eye on the apartments across the courtyard.  Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend, Lisa, and she is at first disinterested and disapproving of his actions, but she too is soon drawn into the human drama.  Thelma Ritter plays her usual sarcastic role as a visiting nurse who is sucked into Jeff's human drama.  Mr. Hitchcock does a brilliant job of making Jeff's voyeurism at first seem comically, a fun way to kill idle time, then slowly building upon a suspicion that grows and grows until it reaches a scary and thrilling conclusion.  The fact that he only allows the audience to see things from the perspective of Jeff's apartment and never allows into the apartments across the courtyard is a brilliant piece of direction and adds to the tension.  Rear Window was the second of the films that Mr. Hitchcock and Mr. Stewart made together and it was rousing success after the disappointment both felt after their first collaboration, 1948's Rope.",Rear Window VHS
344831,"It is a shame that this delightful comedy isn't better known today.  Part of the reason might lie in the fact that the film's star Robert Montgomery (father of Elizabeth Montgomery of BEWITCHED), after a stint in the military in WW II, did very little acting following the war.  Therefore, he doesn't have many later films to draw attention to his career as a whole.  Also, after the war he because deeply involved in political matters, and was one of Hollywood's more avid Communist hunters.  For whatever reason, the film does not today have the reputation it deserves.There have been two remakes of this film, so some explanation is in order.  HERE COMES MR. JORDAN was a film version of a play by Harry Segal titled HEAVEN CAN WAIT.  There was a 1944 film by Ernst Lubitsch called HEAVEN CAN WAIT starring Don Ameche, but that movie had nothing in common with HERE COMES MR. JORDAN (apart from being an equally superb comedy).  In 1978, Warren Beatty wanted to remake HERE COMES MR. JORDAN using the original play's title with Muhammad Ali in the lead role, but Ali's schedule made this impossible, so he cast himself in the lead and transformed the central character into a football quarterback. Not as good as the original film, this actually wasn't a bad movie at all.  In 2001, the film was remade again as DOWN TO EARTH, starring Chris Rock.  I often love Chris Rock, but this film is not merely one of the low points of his career:  it is a miserable film on every level, with the dreadful decision to make our hero a comic rather than an athlete.Because of the remakes, the plot is familiar:  Joe Pendleton, a boxer with a penchant for playing the saxophone and a shot at the title, is accidentally taken to heaven fifty years too early by an overzealous angel who wrongly assumes that he is about to die.  The angel, Messenger 7013 (played marvelously by the inimitable Edward Everett Horton), brings Joe to his supervisor, Mr. Jordan (played magnificently by the ultra-suave and civilized Claude Rains).  It is decided to provide Joe with a new body, where upon he tries in his new millionaire's body to get back into shape (""in the pink"") in order to get a new shot at the championship.  The only trouble is that the millionaire's wife and lover want to kill him so they can get his money and each other.  Rounding out a great cast is Evelyn Keyes as the girlfriend of Joe (and the love interest of his subsequent incarnations) and James Gleason, Joe's trainer, who nearly steals ever scene he is in.  The scene where Joe, in his new body, hires Gleason and then tries to convince him of his real identity, is just hysterical.More people need to see this film.  It remains one of the finer comedies made immediately before the onset of WW II, and is vastly better than the two films based upon it.

After years of bad public domain video copies of these same cartoons, the visual quality of the prints seen on this DVD is breathtaking. (All were transferred flawlessly from original 35mm Technicolor prints.) It should be pointed out that the first nine of the Superman cartoons were produced by cartoon pioneer Max Fleischer (creator of Betty Boop) and directed by his brother, Dave Fleischer. The remaining eight cartoons were produced after the Fleischers left Paramount and were made by house directors at the revamped Paramount/Famous Studio cartoon unit. There is no discernible loss in quality. In fact, the remaining eight all break free from the formula established by the Fleischers and offer some of the real surprises on this disc. All the cartoons boast incredibly beautiful and imaginative imagery.A few notes on some of the individual cartoons:""Billion Dollar Limited"" (1942)Almost nonstop movement and action as a robbery gang tries to derail a train carrying a billion dollars in gold to the mint.

Visible landmarks include the Museum of Natural History and Yankee Stadium. Looks forward to both THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and GODZILLA.""Electric Earthquake"" (1942)Interestingly, the mad scientist villain is an American Indian who demands the return of Manhattan to his people. When his demand is dismissed, he sets off earthquakes on Manhattan by using giant electrical connectors plugged into the island's bedrock underwater.""Eleventh Hour"" (1942)An astounding wartime cartoon as both Clark Kent and Lois Lane are held prisoner in Yokohama by the Japanese. Clark breaks out every night, as Superman, to sabotage Japanese battleships. Lois Lane is even taken before a firing squad at one point.""Secret Agent"" (1943)A straight-ahead crime thriller with car chases in the streets of Metropolis and shootouts with police as a beautiful blonde undercover agent tries to get to Washington with a list of spies and saboteurs. The last of the Superman cartoons and one of the best.If only other American animation producers had taken the lead established by these cartoons and begun doing serious, comic book-based action and science fiction-themed cartoons.

All the performances for that matter are great. The movie, which is mostly set in one location, has a claustrophobic feel; but the flashbacks which are mostly set outdoors, give us breathing room. Q.T. has given us an unusual, and unusually humorous, look into the world of men who happen to be criminals, and into the world of criminals who happen to be friends. Get this movie!",N/A

Tom Berrenger, Andy Griffith, Sela Ward, and many more people you'll recognize. That's another reason I can't beleive people haven't seen this.The story is a western spoof. The hero comes to the western town being used and abused by the evil cattle baron. The hero must stop them and overcome some of his own problems. The story also reveals why the bad guys always lose and why the good guys always win.The movie is great. I guarentee it will make you laugh and laugh hard. If you don't like spoofs then you probaly won't like Rustler's Rhapsody. If you like Blazing Saddles you will definetly love Rhapsody. This is a must own.

Some experts would consider 2001 a low-point in wrestling history, but fueled by the heel turn of Stone Cold Steve Austin, it was one of my favorite years as a wrestling fan.  (Although, note that my *favorite* year as a fan was 1995; so pass judgment with that statement in mind.)The program itself only chronicled the first half of the year, but it is captured in such an entertaining manner that I watch the program more often than its extras, which is a rare statement for me to make about a WWE DVD (as many of you collectors would probably agree).The selection of extra features is unique, and as satisfactory as any compilation of seven matches would be.

He relishes in his villainous character, Hannibal &quot;the cannibal&quot; Lector.

While Clarice tries to obtain information from Lector on the case, Lector obtains information from Clarice's personal life, from her past. Just as Clarice wants to see what makes a madman tick, Lector wants to see what drives a hero. Fans of horror won't be disappointed, and also fans of thrillers.

584974,"What kind of movie is Spider-Man? Are you sure you really want to know? This movie is not for the weak of heart...Summer 2002, millions of die-hard Marvel comic fans were treated to seeing one of their heroes come to life on the big screen. Spider-Man. When I first saw the preview for Spider-Man, it was right before viewing my first PG-13 movie - Lord of the Rings (Another movie for another review). When confronted by the action scenes of the movie, and the grotesque view of the Green Goblin's face, my first thought was ""Ew gross, another dumb blow-'em-up flick."" followed by ""When will they stop with the previews and just show Lord of the Rings?""When the movie came to theaters, however, I checked out some of the reviews at Focus on the Family's Plugged-in website and found that, while it did contain blow-'em-up action scenes and grotesque goblin faces, it did not contain the other junk that usually goes with such movies: swearing every ten seconds by the clock, and more skin than a hospital DOCTOR typically sees. So, after securing permission from my parents, we went to see it. In case you are thinking of seeing it but don't know for sure, or if your kids are hitting you up to go see it, here is as detailed of a review as I can give about the movie's good points and bad points, from the perspective of a 16-year old Christian.In case you are like I was, not knowing about the general basics, here they are:  Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and is transformed into...Spider-Man. Just in time, because Norman Osborn, scientist for OsCorp has just turned into a raving lunatic because of his reckless Human Performance Enhancers test...on himself. Peter/Spidey chooses to protect the city of New York, and ends up in a fight to the death with The Green Goblin.GOOD POINTS: As has been said in other reviews, Spider-Man draws a distinct line between good and evil. When Spider-Man misuses his abilities and refuses to stop a fleeing robber because it ""wasn't his problem"" tragic events result. His Aunt recites nearly all of the Lord's Prayer at one point. There are several expressions of ""Thank God for you"". When offered a chance to join the Green Goblin, Spider-Man chooses good. The Green Goblin, in fact, is portrayed almost as a demon possession of the father. From a purely secular standpoint, the movie is excellent, with its dazzling special effects, allowing us to see and swing along with Spider-Man through New York City. The soundtrack music by Ben Elfman is but the icing on the cake. The story and plot are also very well formed, but occasionally poorly written. The relationship between Peter and Norman Osborn is especially interesting. When Norman is sane, he accepts Peter as a fellow science whiz and almost like a second son. (Then they both go don their respective costumes and beat each other up.) Harry Osborn, Peter's friend, tells Peter at the end that ""Spider-Man must pay"" for something Harry thinks Spider-Man did, he then says ""But thank God for you Peter. You're the only friend I have."" The door is left WIDE open for Spider-Man 2.BAD POINTS: Violence is a key factor. In an attack, Green Goblin drops a bomb-like object to kill his former employers who fired him, and, in a gruesome manner, dispatches them. Spider-Man and Green Goblin slug it out several times, as well as the mandatory explosions and city chaos/blow-'em-up stuff previously mentioned. One key character (who I cannot name) is gored by a blade, nearly bloodless, but intensely violent. Several bad words are used, but unnecessarily so, sadly. The sweet aunt tells the uncle to get off the ladder before he falls on his...um, patootie. I don't remember the D-word being used, but at one point someone makes a remark that is translated ""You are really making me angry"". Kirsten Dunst, Spider-Man's honey, is nearly always immodestly dressed, or as I like to say ""HEY! WHERE'S YOUR SHIRT!?"" At one point she is chased by four hoods who have obvious intent. Spider-Man rescues her, and they kiss as they rain pours down. Dunst's shirt gets...wet, shall we say. When Peter, after realizing his super strength, goes to a wrestling rink to win the [money]prize, there are several severely immodestly-clad women, but it's not entirely emphasized, and otherwise, there is no nudity or immorality, implied or other.MY THOUGHTS: Kids shouldn't see this movie, in my opinion. If it weren't for the bad language, and lack of clothes (""Pants don't cost THAT much, do they?!"") it would be better, but the fact is that it isn't. For those who know what to be on guard for, it's a great watch.""Whatever life has in store for me, I will always remember these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift; my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man.""SPIDER-MAN TRIVIA FUN FACT: Stan Lee makes a cameo as a citizen hero who saves a little kid from falling city wreckage.SPIDER-MAN QUESTION: If Spider-Man wears that suit, how does he climb the walls?

But &quot;Evolution&quot; is still a great fun romp, combining a decent science fiction story with some excellent comedic elements.The story combines all the classic elements of any Reitman comedy, be it Ghostbusters, Stripes or whatever. There's the three buddies, the girl, the blustery politician and of course the evil general. So yes, it's a bit formulaic. But the aliens are wonderfully imaginative, the pacing is good, and the three leads work well together. The Duchovney/Jones teaming works well, and Julienne Moore shows a nice talent for physical comedy.So while perhaps not one of Reitman's best works, Evolution is still a fine bit of entertainment.",Evolution

278474,"A dazzling proto-noir gangster film, featuring Tyrone Power in one of his best roles, as ""Johnny Apollo,"" a wealthy man's son who changes his name and turns to a life of crime after his father is exposed as an embezzler and sent to prison.  Power effectively sheds his pretty-boy image as a romantic leading man, and does an excellent turn as a cynical tough guy -- even more astonishing is Dorothy Lamour's performace as Lucky, a hard-bitten gun moll who takes Johnny under her wing.  Snarling out her lines in a thick urban accent, Lamour is about as far away from her Polynesian and exotic hottie typecasting as possible; she also gives one of the most convincing gangster gal portrayals I've ever seen.  Better still, is Lloyd Nolan's turn as crime boss Mickey Dwyer, whose grinning, boyish enthusiasm and charismatic charm belies his violence yet completely explains Apollo's devotion to him. Nolan plays a cheerful psychopath -- the kind of role that Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci have so artlessly beaten to death -- with such naturalness and ease that his performance may actually be the heart of this film.  Look for his scene with the icebox lock, and you'll see what I mean.  I really enjoyed this film: if you're looking for a good gangster flick, or a Hollywood classic, check this one out!",N/A
481540,"As one who has often panned for gold in the stream of little-known horror delights, I have discovered much more fool's gold than gold dust, but Asylum is a magnificent gold nugget.  Produced by Amicus, the British equivalent of Hammer Studios, this classic film features a remarkable cast bringing to life a compelling, delightfully shocking tale which comes straight from the pen of none other than Robert Bloch.  I think the whole idea of the movie is brilliant, especially the way everything is put together, meshing four largely unrelated tales into one overall and amazingly successful story.  We begin with Dr. Martin's arrival at the asylum in pursuit of a position.  He is surprised to learn that Dr. Styles, the asylum director and the man he expected to speak with about the job, is now one of the incurably insane inmates housed upstairs.  Dr. Rutherford is willing to hire Dr. Martin, but only if he passes a certain test.  There are four inmates upstairs, and he must determine which one is actually Dr. Styles (who has assumed a brand new identity for himself).  As Dr. Martin makes the rounds, accompanied by the doctor posted upstairs, we are presented with each individual's story as to how they came to be institutionalized.The first story, that of Bonnie, is a wholly remarkable one.  Her lover, having finally agreed to kill his divorce-denying wife and run off with her, chops his wife into several pieces and stows everything in the freezer, including her voodoo-ish protective bracelet He is quite shocked shortly thereafter to see the head, wrapped in butcher's paper, roll into view upstairs, and he is even more surprised by what happens next.  When Bonnie arrives, she finds herself menaced and attacked by the separate body parts of the seemingly undead murdered woman.  Next we have the story of Bruno the tailor.  Facing economic ruin, he is offered two hundred pounds to make a suit for a rather strange gentleman named Mr. Smith (played magnificently by Peter Cushing).  The suit must be created under the unusual conditions specified by the customer and must be made from the remarkable fabric Smith has provided Bruno.  This metallic, strangely glittering coat is actually an instrument of magic, Bruno finds out upon delivering it.  Supposedly it has the power to give or restore life to whoever wears it.  Cushing's performance helps make this the strongest of the four stories, in my opinion.  Next up is Barbara, who denies having committed the murders that resulted in her institutionalization.  It was her friend Lucy, she says.  The story plays pretty well until the end, when whatever mystery lingered concerning the truth about Lucy is rather unnecessarily done away with.  Finally, we have Dr. Baron, maker of robotic men; actually, he says, the creatures are quite human on the inside, and he claims to have the power to will his own mind into one such creation and essentially make it come alive with his own consciousness.  This tale has its weaknesses, but its effect on Dr. Martin is profound and sets in motion the thrilling conclusion of the movie.  This conclusion, I must say, is remarkably good, treating me to a wonderful surprise and devilishly good twist.The plot of Asylum does have a weakness or two in it, but the film's overall effect on the viewer is so gripping that minor questions cease to matter very much.  Frankly, I have never seen an anthologized movie such as this succeed so well.  Few movies can combine separate tales and succeed as a unified whole, but Asylum accomplishes this feat quite easily.  This is an intelligent horror movie that fans of the genre can point to with great pride.",Asylum
760967,"The best tele-fantasy in a long, long time, writer Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere is an imaginative breath of fresh air.While technically a fantasy, this is not a fantasy in the dragons-wizards-elves vein, but rather ""fantasy-punk,"" if you will, in the same way that cyberpunk SF is to spaceships and aliens SF.Never mind all the comments and apologies about the production values.  Anyone familiar with a typical BBC SF production will find no surprises here (In fact, Gaiman himself was disappointed in the look of the show, as the BBC had apparently agreed to treat the video with Filmlook in post production, but didn't keep it's promise).I loved the whole thing:  The acting, dialogue, characters (and look for another Dr Who inspiration in the character of the Marquis, who, Gaiman notes in his commentary, was inspired by the earlier, more mysterious and edgier characterizations of the Doctor, probably early Tom Baker if you ask me) costumes, prop design and general mood are all top notch, and the series is of course filled with that wonderful and unique Brit biting sense of humor.I also loved all the incidental details of Gaiman's fictional world:  The use of ""Favors"" as an important form of currency, or the specific ""Talents"" that various people/families have.Edgy, mysterious, dark and disturbing, Neverwhere is a uniquely imaginative show and a long overdue return to the glory days of BBC imaginative tv.Only negative thing I can think of is that it didn't continue on for a second season!",N/A
188321,"I absolutely adore Charlotte Church.  However much some people belittle her talent or claim she is being manipulated by people who are going to ruin her voice, she is a star of stars in my eyes.  She truly does have the voice of an angel; it's the most beautiful voice I've ever heard.  This DVD is a special treat indeed because it allows us to hear and see Charlotte at the very beginning of her professional career.  She had already topped the classical charts with her debut album, and now, mere days after her thirteenth birthday, she gave her first true concert, backed up by the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus - and we can all be there time and again with the 5000 or so fans physically in attendance that night.  The music is fantastic, Charlotte is as charming as she can be, and an inside look at her life at home and her preparation for the concert show us a perfectly normal child who just happens to have a magical voice.After a short introductory piece, Charlotte walks out on stage with no sign of nerves whatsoever.  She brings a couple of friends with her, a white stuffed bear and a shaking critter whom she likens to her Dad before the show (as he was obviously more nervous than Charlotte was about her big night).  Every trace of the adorable little child disappears once she stands before the mike, though.  She leads off with Panis Angelicus, and the transformation from excited youngster to world-class soprano is amazing; while Charlotte always shows her love for what she does, she also reveals her serious commitment to each song in her whole demeanor.  After each song, her youthful nature shines forth in smiles and laughs, but her seriousness never relents until the orchestra plays the final note of each song.  She sings eleven songs in all in this concert performance, ten of which come from her Voice of an Angel CD, backed up by a huge orchestra and sizeable chorus.  Her delivery of The Lord's Prayer is impeccable and soul-stirring, even more so in the light of the attack on 9/11 and another singer's moving rendition of the song during the national memorial service following the tragedy.  Danny Boy is also a beautiful song; Charlotte's version of this song is respectfully somber but not quite as mournful as most renditions I have heard.The Welsh songs are particularly lovely, possessing a nature that really draws me into each song even though I have no idea what Charlotte is singing about.  My Lagan Love, Suo-Gan, and Y Gylfinir (The Curlew) - one of the Three Welsh Bird Songs from her debut album - are quite magical.  Her friend Gwilym Evans joins her for two songs: Charlotte's signature song Pie Jesu and When at Night I Go to Sleep; his high voice blends well with Charlotte's, but he appears far more nervous than Charlotte was.  Charlotte's final song of the evening closes the night out in grand, exciting style, as the London Welsh Male Voice Choir joins her in a stirring rendition of Men of Harlech (the one song here that you won't find on her debut CD).The concert is fairly short, but it is followed by a wonderful look at the real Charlotte Church.  We get visions of both her family and school life, showing Charlotte trying to juggle homework in between interviews for television, newspapers, and magazines from all over the world.  She and her mother look to have a loving and fun relationship, and Charlotte is as proud of her family as they are of her.  The little girl in her is clear to see, as evidenced by a huge stuffed animal collection and her innocent zest for life, and it is reinforced by her mother's descriptions of her sulking prowess.  Charlotte is refreshingly normal and down-to-earth, and she makes it clear that she is singing and performing because that is what she loves and wants to do forever; in no way is anyone manipulating her into doing anything she doesn't want to do.The Voice of an Angel DVD is essentially Charlotte Church's coming-out party; she had proved to the world that she could sing like an angel, and with this concert she proved that she could perform in front of a large audience and not only blow the audience away with a voice of the rarest beauty but also display all the charms and poise of a true star while doing it.  I don't see how anyone could watch this DVD and not love Charlotte Church.",Charlotte Church - Voice of an Angel in Concert
126756,"15 years after crafting the low budget comic cult classic Escape From New York, director John Carpenter finally got the budget he needed in this sequel/reworking of the original film.  Kurt Russell reprises his role as one eyed badass Snake Plisskin as he is dropped into the island of Los Angeles to seek out the president's daughter.  Parts of the film seem more aimed to make a social satire of our dwindling freedom, but sometimes the action gets too incoherent and parts of the film seem uneven.  Not to mention that there are times when the film feels rushed, like Carpenter just wanted to get the film over with.  Either way though, Escape From L.A. is still a fun B-movie ride with a great comic flair, and the great supporting cast which includes Steve Buscemi, Pam Grier, Peter Fonda, Stacy Keach, Cliff Robertson, and B-movie icon Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell make this one of Carpenter's more decent films of late.",N/A
727878,"U2 has proven to be a visually inventive band as well as great musicians. This is most evident not only in their spectacular concerts, but also in their unique videos. Consider here ""The Best Of 1990-2000"" DVD, which compiles concert footage and music videos into a highly entertaining package that delivers basically not just some of the essence of U2, but of great modern rock as well. The opener, ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"" is a visually dazzling video, psychedelic and spacey, yet futuristic with Bono as The Fly with the rest of the band twirling around. The hits are here, ""Mysterious Ways"" proves to be a Middle Eastern taste of U2 psychedelia with The Edge's sultry riff (and a spicy belly dancer). We also get the video for ""Beautiful Day,"" from the band's 2000 ""All That You Can' Leave Behind,"" which won Grammy and proves to be an equally soaring video (eventhough the album's best cut, ""Elevation"" should also be included here). ""Electrical Storm,"" one of the band's new songs, is hypnotic as well as the black and white video that has a classic cinema feel to it. There are great memorable moments here too, as is the case with ""Miss Sarajevo,"" the band's collaboration with Pavorotti that helped the world look towards what was happening in Sarajevo, there is a mini-documentary included chronocling the band's historical 1997 PoPMart Tour stop there. ""Gone"" is a stunning live performance from Mexico City that shows the band's essence on stage, but the best live clip is ""Until The End Of The World,"" a stunning, exhilarating and roaring performance during the Zoo TV tour. ""The Hands That Built America"" from the ""Gangs Of New York"" film is performed here in a clip showing the band sitting around and performing the song, it's a wonderful tune that deserves the Oscar for it's emotional touch. U2 can also be funny, as is the case with the video for ""Discotheque"" which shows the band apparently inside a disco ball as the Village People at one point, here the band does indeed look ""cool"" and it displays the band at their funnest. But the most fun video is ""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me,"" their ""Batman Forever"" cut here is expressed with some great animation showing the band in a comic book universe where Bono's stage characters, The Fly and Macphisto square off (also included is an orchestra composed of Batmans). ""Staring At The Sun"" is lush and hypnotic, with great colors and photography courtesy of Ridley Scott's son who directs here showing he can make just as wonderful images as his father. ""Numb"" plays like a great acting piece, The Edge sits in front of the camera reciting the song's commands as activities such as women sucking on his face, cutting off his clothes and dancing in his face take place as he continues reciting. Finishing the set is ""The Fly,"" which for some reason is here but not included in the CD set. This is still a hard-edged, spacey track with Bono singing some devilish poetics. One of the joys of this DVD is how the band treats the videos like mini movies, we get director's commentaries (with some interesting insights) and documentaries, also included are some great bonus songs such as the video for ""Lemon,"" which is simply great filmmaking. ""The Best Of 1990-2000"" is great coverage of U2's most exhilarating decade and ends with the promise of some great rock still rising in the horizon.",N/A

520832,"The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't too crazy about it, and didn't see why it was so popular.  The second time I saw it, my view on this movie changed.Perhaps knowing that the movie won't have an ending after you sit there for  2 and a half hours had something to do with my change of heart, or maybe it was because I watched it over 2 days instead of sitting through the whole thing at once.  But now, since I enjoyed this movie a bit more this time, let's get to my review of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.&lt;u>LOTR- The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/u> was based on the first book in the Lord of the Rings book triligy.  The movies story, without giving too much away, is about a Hobbit named Froto Baggins who inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo.  Froto's friend and advisor, Gandof the Wizard, informed him that the ring is evil, and if found by the wrong people, all of Middle-Earth will be destroyed.  Frodo then leaves so the ring wouldn't be found, and ends up at Elron, where The Fellowship of the Ring was formed to serve as the protectors of the ring before it is destroyed in the fires in Mt. Doom.  Since this is only part one of a triligy, the story ends abruptly, and if you're not expecting it, can be very disappointing.This movie had great camera work, besides from a good story.  Some of the camera shots in this movie were &lt;i>very&lt;/i> impressive, and it all worked well for the movie's advantage.  Then there were the special effects.  ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) had a big part in this movie.  There were the Hobbits, who were made to look like they were half the size as everyone else, and then the orcs, and Golum, and all of the other creatures involved in the story.  The scenery was hugely ILM influenced too.  While many shots were just straight impressive shots, others were impressive by the digitally added effects.  I don't disagree with the academy awards that this movie won.  It deserved it.Overall, Lord of the Rings:  Fellowship of the Ring was a very well done, feel good movie with plenty of action, great special effects, with the moral that good always defeats evil (except in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King).",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

The framing device involves an architect who is invited to spend a weekend at a country estate.  When he arrives, he begins to feel he has experienced all this before, in a dream.  The various guests then tell their own stories (all dramatized in flashbacks) of bizarre and possibly supernatural events in their own lives, mainly to convince a skeptical, materialistic psychologist.  Ironically, the psychologist eventually tells the most bizarre story of the five!  Unlike most other anthology films, this one ties the stories together in a weird climax which finally suggests that the whole thing is starting all over again, in an endlessly repeating circle.",Dead of Night VHS
808208,"""The Last Samurai"" is one of this year's best movies! It is brilliant and poignant, with emotional and brilliant performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast. Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren, a man who is conflicted by the past by a very serious incident that happened during the Civil War. He is offered a job in Japan, where he is going to train the emperor's soldiers. But, when they are pulled into combat early, that is when during the soldiers' first attack that Algren is captured by the Samurai and kept alive by Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. That he is where he learns about his enemy and gets enlightened by them and decides to stay with them. Timothy Spall plays Simon Graham, a translator and photographer who is with Algren in this magnificent journey. Billy Connolly plays Zebulon Gant, a dear friend of Algren. Tony Goldwyn plays Colonel Bagley, a comrade and enemy of Algren's. This is a brilliant movie with a powerful story and a powerful word about how you look at things and you think at what they should be. Edward Zwick's directing is brilliant. The costume design by Ngila Dickson is splendid. The production design by Lilly Kilvert is incredibly beautiful. The film editing by Steven Rosenblum and Victor du Bois is excellent. The cinematography by John Toll is brilliant. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful and brilliantly excellent. The story & screenplay by John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz, & Edward Zwick is emotionally powerful and brilliant. Go see this movie and it might inspire you and make you think about things in perspective. See it before you see ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" in theaters everywhere. I enjoy this movie because it was a little different than some people expect. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys these kinds of movies. Even a person who isn't a Tom Cruise fan will probably enjoy it as well.",N/A

I try to turn people onto it as often as possible.THE TALL GUY, first and foremost, is very British in its humor, which means there is irony, surrealism, and jokes that don't depend on insults (Americans *love* the insult-joke).THE TALL GUY has the funniest sex scene (Goldblum and Thompson) that I've ever seen.  And as others have mentioned, the ELEPHANT! musical is hysterical.  I cried the first time I saw the musical numbers ... it's that hilarious.At heart, THE TALL GUY is a sweet romance.  But its British sensibilities and backstage humor (Goldblum's character is an underdog actor) lifts it above an average screwball comedy.  And Emma Thompson is very charming as Nurse Kate!  One forgets after all of her serious Shakespeare and Jane Austin roles that she is quite a comedienne.So enjoy THE TALL GUY!

24611,"This movie is an all time classic.  It can be viewed as a straight action movie, but has many subtleties that reward repeated watching:  there's a subtext on how being a Samurai is more than just being a warrior, there are complex relationships between all the major farmer and Samurai characters, there are illustrations of how the Samurai, farmers, and bandits all shaped each other in 16th century Japan, and much more.  While the movie is substantially longer than the typical Hollywood release, there's enough going on that it never drags.The DVD version has a substantially cleaner and better picture than the VHS tape version in almost all scenes.  Because the movie is black and white, making the DVD video compression more efficient, the entire three and a half hour movie fits onto one disc.

It's a movie for people who can appreciate and remember what movies are made for; telling a story. And such a story.

604381,"Two days later, and I'm still thinking about ADAPTATION.First, the screenplay by Charlie Kaufman is brilliant.  The movie takes so many surprising twists and turns that Kaufman keeps you on your toes.  And then he manages to take the story into territory you never thought it would go (clue: Streep is in her RIVER WILD mode toward the end), and then manages to let his characters change (a screenwriting essential, according to the film!) and &quot;adapt.&quot;The reason ADAPTATION is fascinating is because it is aware of its story and the screenwriting process -- it's about Charlie Kaufman (played by Nicholas Cage).  Immediately, one thinks: &quot;How could a screenwriter put himself in a movie about a screenwriter trying to adapt an unadaptable book?!  Isn't that self-absorbed?&quot;  Then you see Cage, as Kaufman, say the exact same thing in the movie.  Which completely draws you in and makes the film utterly fascinating.Kaufman has made a movie about a book (THE ORCHID THIEF, ISBN: 044900371X)  Then, he fictionalizes the author of that book (Susan Orlean, played by Meryl Streep) as a character in the movie ... get it?  Along the way, Kaufman's story takes over and the book's story fades away.  But Kaufman and Orlean's worlds are intertwined and ADAPTED into a hybrid story about a self-conscious screenwritor and a quirky, undramatic flower story.  Very smart stuff.Director Spike Jonze does an excellent job.  Cage is brilliant as Kaufman and his twin brother Donald, who is the yang to Charlie's yin.  It's so great to see Streep in this type of film.  I liked her better here than in THE HOURS.Even the title of the film has dual meanings:  It's about ADAPTING a book; and it's about how we, as humans, ADAPT and change.  Kaufman's brought it all together beautifully with the orchids as symbols of all this.  Ohhhh, so good!The DVD, by the way, has no extra features beyond a trailer.  The image and sound, however, look and sound great.  I watched it in anamorphic format on my digital widescreen tv, and was completely satisfied with the viewing experience.I'd recommend this film for people who (a) can't stand the major movies out there these days that are aimed at teenagers, (b) like a movie to surprise them and challenge them, (c) like unconventional storytelling (flashbacks, flashforwards, etc.), (d) want to learn about Orchids.

Even though Michael Myers does not make an appearance in this film, it is definitely worth trying out.The story revolves mainly around the Silver Shamrock company which makes novelty items. The owner of the company comes up the diabolical plan to teach children a lesson about the REAL meaning of Halloween. He advertises &quot;special&quot; Halloween masks that the children flock to get. On Halloween night, a commercial runs on television that will ultimately kill all of the children, melting their heads and making various insects spill out. There is also a side story in which robots, who work for Silver Shamrock, go around doing anything necessary (including killing) to make sure that the secrets of the Silver Shamrock company remain hidden. A doctor and a murdered toyshop owner's daughter become wrapped up in this plan and try to put a stop to it. The ending will shock you!I really enjoyed this film because it was very interesting and kept me glued to the screen the entire time.

Working with a next to no budget, director Tobe Hooper, co-writer Kim Henkel, and photographer Daniel Pearl manage to capture on film true insanity at its most blood curdling.  Sally Hardesty, her invalid brother Franklin, and a group friends travel to the small town of Newt, Texas to see if a relative's grave was the victim of a desecration (some one had dug up and played with the bodies - ala Ed Gein).  Low on gas, they stop at a small filling station, which is out of gas.  The group decide to wait at the ruins of an old family home...but the neighbors are hiding a horrifying secret and one by one Sally's friends discover and fall victim to it, until only Sally remains.  Will she survive, and what will be left of her?  Considering what little they had to work with, the movie is a technical marvel.  One that still packs a punch today...despite being sequelized and ripped off almost as many times as John Carpenter's Halloween has been.

561938,"&quot;False Prophet,&quot; Volume 4 of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Wandering Samurai&quot; offers up five episodes from what I am inclined to think is the start of the second season of the Japanese anime because there is a new song for the end titles.  After the epic four-episode battle between Himura Kenshin and Aoshi Shinomori these episodes are less ambitious and a probably just a lull before the next major storm.  The most important think that happens in these five episodes is the return of Megumi Takani, who is now practicing medicine in town.  Since we know that Kenshin and Karou are going to take forever to really notice each other have Sanosuke Sagara pinning for Megumi looks a lot more promising:Episode 13, &quot;Strive for the Grand Championship: Taramaro's Sumo Battle Log&quot; has the gang becoming involved in the workings of a sumo school, touching on another aspect of Japanese culture.Episode 14, &quot;Save a Small Life: The Challenge of the Beautiful Doctor, Megumi&quot; finds the good doctor's reputation being attacked by a group of con men who promise cures by the gods.  Megumi does not want to fight back, but that is what friends are for in such sticky situations.Episode 15, &quot;Assassination Group of Fire: Jipuu Squad on the Run&quot; is where &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; actually starts offering us teasers before the episode title.  The politics of the Meji Restoration comes into play again as the motivation for a series of assassinations.  Once again a master swordsman comes upon the scene who has failed to fully understand the teachings of his sensei.  The story continues in the next Episode 16, &quot;A Promise From the Heart: The Secret Technique of the Shiden Renga Blade,&quot; and are the two best episodes on the DVD.Episode 17, &quot;Fly to Your Dreams: The Adventures of Marimo, the Human Bullet&quot; has the gang visiting a new circus where the highlight has young Marimo being shot out of a cannon.  Once again &quot;little&quot; Yahiko is smitten and when the girl and her father are in danger from the crooked operators of the circus they left, he leads the rescue effort.&quot;False Prophet&quot; certainly provides a mixture of both of the type of episodes you see on &quot;Rurouni Kenshin.&quot;  Mostly we have cute little episodes where the members of the group have fun doing some verbal sparring with each other and then we have a pair of episodes where things get more serious.  Those are the best episodes and they make the quainter onces seem rather out of place, but then this strange balancing act is part of what makes this one of the better anime.  The extras this time around consist of a lengthy set of notes involving a lot of sumo definitions (ozeki, yokozuna, dosukoi, etc.) and some more audio ""outtakes"" (which are R rated, so be forewarned before you let the kiddies watch).","Rurouni Kenshin - False Prophet, Vol. 4"

242175,"I rarely watch older films. By &quot;older&quot; films, I mean movies made before 1960. It's not due to some prejudice on my part about black and white cinematography: my inability to view many early films arises from the fact that far too many of these movies are so melodramatic. You know what I mean: lots of swooning, hands swept across foreheads, and exaggerated body movements all set to crashing waves of syrupy orchestral music. Those swelling violins alone are enough to set my teeth on edge anytime I watch an old film, but occasionally a picture overcomes all of these pet peeves of mine and truly delivers on multiple levels. &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; is one of those films. Sure, the emoting is there, as is the music and the swooning, but this compelling story about an alcoholic at the end of his rope always pulls at my heartstrings. I am going to start seeking out some classic older films that will tickle my fancy, but I don't expect to find too many of them with the power of &quot;The Lost Weekend.&quot;Ray Milland (an actor who starred in several schlockfests at the end of his career, such as &quot;Frogs&quot;) plays Don Birnam, a painfully insecure writer who just can't make his life work. Birnam quickly learned that the soothing balm of alcohol took the edge off his various phobias, but he just as quickly learned that drinking took the edge off his talent, too. For years, Birnam never wandered far from the neighborhood bar or the liquor store, secure in the knowledge that a bottle of rye was always within reach. His brother Wick not only financially supports his boozy sibling; he also covers for him when the drinking causes problems. Of course, Don doesn't care much about his brother one way or the other as long as he gets his shot of whisky when he needs it. Another problem for Don appears in the form of Helen St. James (played by an enormously cute Jane Wyman), a successful writer at Time magazine who accidentally met Don at the opera one night and has since latched on to him despite his chronic alcoholism. When Birnam isn't trying to outwit Wick or Helen, he's down at the local bar spouting alcoholic witticisms to Nat the bartender (played wonderfully by Howard Da Silva) and flirting with a beautiful barfly named Gloria. We learn most of the story through a flashback sequence told by Birnam as he ties on yet another massive drunk.The film starts with a nervous Don packing for a weekend trip with brother Wick, where the two siblings hope to get out of New York City for a nice change of pace. Of course, Don doesn't want to go because he's not sure he can survive without ready access to booze. In fact, during this opening sequence we see Don hiding a bottle of whisky from his brother by hanging it from a piece of string outside his window. In order to start drinking, Birnam convinces Wick and Helen to go to a concert, a little piece of trickery that is only the beginning of the devious schemes hatched by Don throughout the film. Thus begins a downward spiral over the course of a four-day weekend, as Don resorts to outright theft, robbery, and beggary in order to secure just one more drink. This bender comes with a high price, though: Don suffers excruciating blackouts, nearly gets himself arrested, and ends up in the alky ward at the city asylum. The capper is Birnam's bout with the DTs in his apartment, an incident that reduces him to a shattered, screaming wreck. &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; is a memorable experience.Only a person who has never had a problem with alcohol would criticize some of Birnam's philosophical musings about drinking. There is a great bit of dialogue where Birnam tells Nat why he drinks, about how alcohol makes a person feel as though he or she is a great artist on top of the world. Believe me, this is how an alcoholic feels when they tie one on, at least in the early euphoric stages of the addiction. Birnam's enthrallment for rituals of drinking is also dead on; such as his fascination about the rings the shot glass leaves on the bar and the propensity to &quot;see&quot; liquor in the most mundane circumstances (look for the dancing raincoats with the rye bottle in the pocket). An alcoholic does not merely work at his trade part-time; the process of drinking is a full-time job built on a series of elaborate rituals that reinforce this nefarious addiction. &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; captures the intricacies of alcoholism in a way few films ever have. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power due to some hokey effects and a conclusion that had me throwing my hands up in disbelief.The DVD release is quite good for a film nearly sixty years old. There is a trailer and cast biographies included here, as well as a short bio for director Billy Wilder. The transfer looks pretty good, although I thought I saw a few scenes where certain parts of the picture looked a tad blurry. &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; won four Oscars: Best Actor for Ray Milland, Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Director for Billy Wilder. As far as I can see, this movie deserves its accolades.

He is known to have made clothing and household items from the preserved skin and bones of his ""trophies,"" and it was reported that he also ate some of the flesh (though this was never substantiated).  Gein was caught and arrested in 1957 after actually killing the proprietor of a hardware store, then taking her body to his barn and preparing it in the manner of a hunter dressing a deer.In DERANGED, the primary character is named Ezra Cobb, and though a lot of the real-life necrophilic and cannibalistic acts have been toned down for the script, Cobb is still a fairly accurate reflection of Edward Gein.  To make these ghoulish themes a little more palatable, scriptwriter and co-director Alan Ormsby mixes in lots of gallows humor.  In addition, the over-the-top performance of award-winning character actor Roberts Blossom, as Ezra Cobb, adds some jocularity to the film, but never goes so far as to diminish the overall horror.Like Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, which was released the same year, DERANGED opens with an attempt to convince the audience that what they will soon see is the gospel truth.  But instead of having a mere voice-over and some scrolling transcript, DERANGED takes it a step further with a phony news anchor who introduces the film as if it were a docu-drama--a very effective device for getting the audience into the right mind-set.If you like raw, true-to-life horror, or if you're interested in films that are inspired by grisly real-life crimes, you'll love DERANGED.  You'll also enjoy the film if you're the type of fan who likes his horror played tongue-in-cheek.  Non-genre fans may be a bit put off.MOTEL HELL:Farmer Vincent Smith and his loopy sister, Ida, are the proprietors of the Motel Hello (the last neon ""o"" is often burned out), next to which is a small meat-processing factory that they also own and operate.  The meat products they make and peddle are actually more popular than the Motel--and more lucrative.  Indeed, people come from all over the country to to satisfy their hankerin' for Farmer Vincent's meats.Customers frequently comment on how the Smith's meats have a delicious but distinctly unique flavor, and they are always trying to pry the secret from Smith and Ida.  Is it the way they process it?  Is it some exotic seasoning?  Or is it the way they raise or butcher the animals?  Farmer Vincent says that he uses no preservatives, and it's the all-natural ingredients that make the meat taste soooo yummy.  But as a highway billboard declares, ""It takes ALL kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent's fritters.""  An' when it says ALL, it ain't lyin'!  Under cover of night, Smith and his sister frequently shanghai society's undesirables as they are passing through town, and...well, that ain't just beef and pork in them fritters!MOTEL HELL isn't just a horror film; it's also a dark comedy.  The plot is goofy but fun, and the dialogue is sometimes outrageous, yet certain scenes can really raise the hair on the back of the neck.  It's a mixture that works well here, and it's hard not to become engrossed.  Part of the reason it plays so well is, of course, the acting.  Veteran actor Rory Calhoun is perfectly cast as Farmer Vincent Smith, as his straight-faced delivery only adds to the hilarity of the script.  Sister Ida is played by Nancy Parsons, an award-winning character actor who has proven to be quite adept at both comedy and drama, having appeared on TV in soaps and shows like BARETTA and THE ROCKFORD FILES, and later in films like PORKYS (1982) and STEEL MAGNOLIAS (1989).  She does an outstanding job in MOTEL HELL, deftly making Ida's persona switch back and forth between an uproariously funny country hick and a downright terrifying murderer.Throughout MOTEL HELL, there are several witty and playful nods to countless horror classics.  And alert viewers will be able to spot a few famous faces, including the late Wolfman Jack, a 1970s radio personality and former host TV's THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL; John Ratzenberger, better known as Cliff the postman on TV's CHEERS; Elaine Joyce, former wife of the late Bobby Van who is currently married to playwright Neil Simon; Monique St. Pierre, German beauty who was the 1979 PLAYBOY Playmate of the Year; and the late Hollywood stuntman Everett Creach.Horror fans and those who enjoy gallows humor will love MOTEL HELL, as will fans of the kinds of movies that used to show up on local late-night TV. Others, including those who don't appreciate the art of campy humor, may just think it's silly.",Deranged / Motel Hell
708695,"I went to watch the movie because it's International Film Festival in Christchurch & that, in accordance to the description, it was the highest gross movie in France to-date.  When there was also this commentary about this movie being a mish mash of Jaws, Matrix, Crouching Tiger, I thought to myself this movie has got potential.  I have always expected French movie to be a bit out of this world but then again, there is a word to describe it, flair~  Anyhow, when the movie started, it definitely showed a glint of promise, with those slow motion cinematography, hinting slowly at John Woo style, & with the ocassional multi angle Matrix style fighting style.  However, the movie went downhill from here.  The main characters looked very much like Christopher Lambert in his heydays & his brother, an Iroquois was none other than the actor who played the TV series, the Crow.  Towards the end of the movie, the style became looser & looser & the plot also became incoherent.  The killing style was more fitting to a mish mash of From Dusk Till Dawn (Quentin Taratino style), Bollywood style movies with a dash of HK style kung-fu movies.  Anyway, you can probably describe this movie as an international effort, or probably you can say that this movie is also trying to be Jack of all trade but as you know how the saying goes, and the master of none.  Naturally, Monica Belluchi from Malena was underutilised here.  Other than displaying her voluptuous body, her role as a high class prostitute & working for the Pope to investigate the mystery of the monster which devoured people here were questionable.  A movie worth watching for a good laugh and not necessarily for its quality.  Should this movie is really the highest gross movie in France, obviously, the audience tends to differ from my opinion",N/A
740183,"...and by God was I right!(See my review on the Philosopher's Stone)What has happened in the time between the two Harry Potter movies? Hmmm..  Ah! yes of course! The Lord of the Rings has happened! And did they have this amazing, over-the-top achievement in CGI, called ""the Gollum""? Yes sir, they did! And who was the first to shamelessly ""borrow"" the idea and bring it in their own movie? Chris Columbus and Co. for their next HP adventure of course.I have to admit that this movie is a lot better than the first one. But that does not qualify for a good movie in general.Borrowing a lot of elements from the horror genre, this one hopes to bring some chills to the children of the globe with the amazing MPAA looking completely the other way.The story? ok,  let's see....Marty and Doc, oops sorry, Harry and Ron, climb on their flying car, to Hogwarts school, even after being advised not to, by a poorly executed Gollum impersonation. There, they stubmle upon a murdering beast that is set loose in the school, controlled by an evil entity which also controls an innocent student to... ... ...set loose and control the beast.(?)The evil entity is using somebody else's body to do it's dirty deeds, much like (well the first that comes to mind) Freddy Krueger in Nightmare 2. This entity lives in a book and is risen when the book was read aloud.... Something of an Evil Dead kind of pilosophy.It could actually be ok, if the ""borrowing"" stopped there.But...Let's not forget Star Wars, our main influence.The Quiddich game, this time a little more elaborate, is an almost exact copy of the forrest chase in ""Return of the Jedi"", Leia on the Speeder-Bike and the Stormtroopers chasing her. And of course, the Hint of a love game, between NOT him that has the power, but the goofy sidekick, and the girl. At least in Star Wars they were siblings (Luke and Leia). What explanation is mrs. Rowling going to give for Ron and Hermione... who knows (I refuse to read the books.)One of the major scenes in the movie includes a gigantic spider, much like ""Shelob"" of the LOTR, which did not make the final cut of the ""Two Towers"" and was reserved for the ""Return of the King"". The spider is almost named ""Aragorn"", ha ha!!My 9 year old daughter remarked that the head of the giant snake, came right out of Jurassic Park's T-Rex. (She is 9 for christ's sake!)And last but not least... the great climax scene...I think it was the ""Nightmare on Elm Sreet 3"", where the school teacher went to the place they had buried Freddy's Skeleton, he had a fight with it, and then, when Nancy lay unconcious in front of the grave, he sprayed Holy Water on it, and the real Freddy burst in rays of pure light.Hmmmm..... Jenny unconcious... the book.... the fang... bursts of light.... make the connection?I give up. No more for this one...To be continued.... (it always does...)",N/A
611153,"Like everyone else, I had my doubts about this movie. Without James Cameron behind the wheel, it could never be as good as the first two, or so we thought. Well, we were wrong. With the director of U-571 in charge, T3 is every bit as good as Cameron's works, except that it's a lot more funny and the plot holds more surprises as it unravels. The whole thing with this Terminator being the same one that kills John in the far future is wonderfully ironic. Sarah's absence is explained beyond beautifully, and Dr. Silverman is back! I only have two complaints. The first is that it has a few clerical errors - for example, it says John Connor was 13 in T2, when in fact he was ten. The second complaint is that despite our computer technology being some ten or twelve years better than what was used for T2, the CGI actually looks WORSE. Of course, T2's CGI only had to make a silvery blob, and didn't try to make anything as complicated as the T-X.Make no mistake, this movie is definitely a legitimate and powerful extension of the Terminator saga.",Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines

782261,"17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain (Romola Garai) lives with her eccentric father (Bill Nighy) and stepmother (Tara Fitzgerald), her older sister Rose (Rose Byrne), and younger brother in run-down castle in the English countryside. Her father is a struggling writer who is unable to reproduce the success of his first book, and, without an income, the family is plunged into poverty. When the old castle's owner dies, his nephews from America, Simon (Henry Thomas) and Neil (Marc Blucas), inherit the property and the neighboring estate. Rose sees the presence of these eligible bachelors as the opportunity of a lifetime to marry well, escape the countryside, and provide means for her family. But Cassandra and Rose's upbringing in isolation among idiosyncratic relatives may be an impediment as the young women find that they lack the understanding of society that would help them find husbands and love.""I Capture the Castle"" is based on the popular novel of the same name by Dodie Smith. It is basically a soap opera set in rural England of the 1930s. Poor young ladies meet rich eligible men and fall in love. But who will marry whom, and will they marry for love or money? But it is a charming soap opera -only slightly sappy- with an appealing conglomeration of attractive and eccentric characters. Cassandra, who narrates the story, is its flawed heroine, who tries her best to hold her family together and sort out everyone's problems. I'm not sure she acts like a 17-year-old. She is, by her own admission, ""self-consciously naive"". But I think the book and the film are aimed at a younger audience, so Cassandra is in many ways more like them. The film does have one unfortunate characteristic of a soap opera in that it eventually gives the impression of repeating itself. Nevertheless, it is a light-hearted entertaining story told through the occasionally melodramatic experiences of a reluctantly romantic young woman. Henry Thomas gives a nice convincing and sympathetic performance. Recommended, especially for 9-13 year old girls.Those who are familiar with the book may wonder why this movie is rated R, since the book is a favorite among pre-teen girls. It is rated R for nudity of the topless variety in one scene. It shouldn't be. Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother, is a bit of a nudist. Since brief topless nudity is permitted in the PG-13 rating, I have to say that this film was rated incorrectly. Without that scene, a PG rating would be appropriate. And that is what it received in most parts of the world. The DVD contains both full and wide screen versions of the film.",I Capture the Castle
26465,"""Charade"" is enjoyable, but not as much as one would expect. Having seen the film for the first time on DVD, I thought it was a generally well-crafted tale, but wondered why on earth would Hollywood want to make a re-make of this film that is clearly a product of the 1960s. It's no wonder that ""The Truth About Charlie"" died a quick death at the box office last year.First of all, ""Charade"" requires the audience to accept a lot. The film's credibility rests squarely on Cary Grant's shoulders. We are to assume that the man called Peter Joshua (Grant) is so dashing and charming that Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) will side with him no matter what. That might have worked for 1960s audiences, but for contemporary audiences that's pushing things a bit.However, if you are willing to accept that (or simply overlook it), you're in for a nice ride. The film has plenty of plot twists and turns with some great set pieces. The scene with the trap doors is a classic.With the exception of Grant and to a lesser extent Hepburn, the performances are rather broad. The supporting players generally fall into familiar ""types."" George Kennedy is a classic ""heavy,"" for example.The DVD includes audio commentary by producer/director Stanley Donen and screenwriter Peter Stone. The bickering that goes on between them is quite amusing at times. It starts off with Donen's insistance that Stone not reveal any of the ""clues"" in the film. Meanwhile, Stone argues that anybody listening to the audio commentary has already seen the film and wants to know how the clues were set up. Another example is when Donen gets into a disagreement with Stone about whether or not Stone ""wrote"" a particular shot in the morgue scene.Between the bickering, there are several intriguing anecdotes about the making of the film including how the original studio passed on the film. Also included is an abundant supply of trivia about the film. For example, in one scene we see Peter Stone, but it's actually Donen's voice we hear coming out of his mouth.Overall, ""Charade"" is a very entertaining film, if a bit dated. If you're a fan of the two leads, it's a must-see. If not, it's still worth serious consideration because of the craft in which it was made.",N/A

377402,"&quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot; is one of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;'s more controversial stories.  Taken from Season 22, right before the show got cancelled (albeit briefly), it's unusually dark and violent.  This was at the beginning of the short-lived Colin Baker 6th Doctor era, whose darker take on the title role caused some audience acceptance problems.  &quot;Varos&quot; is then a worthwhile choice for the first 6th Doctor story to be released on DVD, while not the best story available.Given the &quot;Restoration Team&quot; treatment, &quot;Varos&quot; is notably lacking in the care and attention given to the extra features that made, for example, &quot;Aztecs&quot; and &quot;Caves of Androzani&quot; such outstanding DVD acquisitions.  There are no production featurettes here, no behind-the-scenes interviews with cast members or the production crew.  3 features simply dump raw video footage without any explanation.  The &quot;outtakes&quot; and the &quot;behind-the-scenes featurette&quot; basically show the same thing... aborted takes with a PA calling cast members &quot;darling&quot; and &quot;love&quot; a lot.  The extended/deleted scenes montage, while satisfyingly long (10 minutes), doesn't offer any context to those scenes would have fit into the story, as was done on the far more professional &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; presentation.  Baffingly, one audio tracks allows you to watch the complete episode... without incidental music or sound effects.  I'm not sure who would sit through 90 minutes of this.Fortunately, the audio commentary track is well above-average.  Many DW stories are narrated by aging cast members who barely remember their time on the show; not here.  Colin Baker is well-versed in his character's mythology, and is able to walk the audience through the particularly controversial scene in which the Doctor seemingly shoves a security guard into a vat of boiling acid.  From a production standpoint, he attempts to explain why this scene isn't as bad as it appears.  Nicola Bryant (Peri) doesn't say much (and she didn't on the &quot;Caves of Androzani&quot; DVD either), but Nabil Shaban (Sil, an anatomically-correct slug sitting on a fishtank) shows himself to be a real &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan, and tells some funny on-the-set stories as well (such as the time when, in costume, he was mistaken for an inanimate prop!).  Both Baker and Shaban together may come across a bit smug, as they deride &quot;reality TV&quot; and &quot;post-Thatcherite economics&quot;, but they both provide excellent, funny context for the story.  &quot;Varos&quot; becomes one of the few DW DVDs so far with an audio commentary worth playing more than once.James Bond fans who purchase the disc will be interested to note that &quot;Varos&quot; marks the TV debut of Jason Connery, son of Sean.  He doesn't have a whole lot to do here -- he plays a no-nonsense rebel who goes shirtless most of the way -- but it's interesting to note that his chest is nearly as hairy as his dad's.",Doctor Who - Vengeance on Varos VHS
705196,"I enjoyed the Final season, but I didn't care for it as much as the previous four seasons. Season Five, felt almost as though the writers knew the series was ending and they didn't need to 'try' so hard to pull it off. Several characters change radically: Daisy becomes a nagging shrew, and kitchenmaid Ruby shows a 'spark' of the original character design in that she is a bit 'larcenous,' (claiming in the end, that she planned to outlive Mr. Hudson and Mrs. Bridges and inherit the business).Favorite episode was: &quot;Will they no come back again?&quot; where the staff and master James and the rest go to Scotland for vacation. Hudson manages to handle things with his usual aplomb and dignity, and the staff are forced to confront a mysterious 'ghost.'The ending, I felt was sad and almost 'tacked on.' I would've liked a more 'happier ending' than the one which was given. Overall, while I enjoyed season five, it lacked the vitality and hopefullness of season four.... And, at least for me, has far less 'rewatch-ability.'",N/A

751866,"It is interesting to rewatch the 1951-52 first season of ""I Love Lucy,"" where the scripts were exploring the screwball possibilities of Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) trying to break into the world of entertainment like her husband, Ricky (Desi Arnaz), bandleader at the Tropicana Club.  The first half of the season was okay, but the second half finds the cast and writers Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr. really hitting stride.  The theme of Volume 7 is on more about husbands and wives (or husbands versus wives) rather than on Lucy's show business aspirations:Episode 24, ""The Gossip"" (March 24, 1952) offers another battle of the sexes as Fred (William Frawley) and Ricky bet they can keep from gossiping longer than Ethel (Vivian Vance) and Lucy.  The outcome is predictable, but the journey is half the fun.Episode 25, ""Pioneer Women"" (March 31, 1952) is, quite simply, the one with the twelve-foot loaf of bread.  Everybody remembers the sight gag, but do you remember the premise?  Fred and Ricky challenge Ethel and Lucy to a contest to see who can survive the longest without the conveniences of modern life.  This means having to bake your own bread and figuring out how much yeast to use.Episode 26, ""The Marriage License"" (April 7, 1952) has Lucy finding out that her marriage license to Ricky is not legally binding.  The simple thing to do would be to have the paperwork done right, but Lucy insists that Ricky play out their entire courtship.  Not as funny as the how the same situation played out on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (""Laura's Little Lie,"" October 9, 1963), but then Petrie's had a kid, which gave that classic episode a bit more edge.  Note: Elizabeth Patterson, who would play Little Ricky's baby-sitter Mrs. Trumbull appears in this episode, but as a different character.Episode 27, ""The Kleptomaniac"" (April 14, 1952) hinges on Ricky finding a whole bunch of goods that Lucy has collected for a charity bazaar.  Since Ricky does not know about the bazaar, he jumps to the conclusion that Lucy is a kleptomaniac and needs psychiatric help.  The psychiatrist is played by Jospeh Kearns, who would go on to play Mr. Wilson on ""Dennis the Menace.""This solid quartet puts Volume 7 in the top four of the nine volumes that collect the first season and the original unaired pilot (36 episodes in all).  However, the top volume is the next one up, which contains one of the most famous ""I Love Lucy"" episodes of all time, ""Lucy Does a TV Commercial.""  Still, what we have here is ample reason why every Monday night literally half of the nation's television sets were tuned to this classic situation comedy.",N/A

471764,"One of the first things I thought after viewing South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut was 'this is everything the television show wanted to be but couldn't'. I really wish South Park was on HBO or some other channel that didn't have to worry about language and content censorship.I hate musicals but here is the exception. The songs are dead on to broadway and older hollywood films and undermine that format perfectly. If not for the constant swearing and taboo subjects this could be the soundtrack to any children's film.Satan pining away over living up there, meaning here.The mole and his exceptionally intense views on god.Saddam Hussein as the devil's love interestBig Gay Al's musical number...anyone notice the name on the piano? If you don't know what it is look it up it's pretty wild.Plot-wise Bigger, Longer & Uncut is very strong with plenty of barbs about popular culture, cultural icons, has been artists...none of which you need to know for the jokes to be funny. Demonstrating the V-Chip as a form of cussing control still is funny even though it now exists, and I'm sure kids everywhere cuss at it frequently depending on mom and dad.Also, much of the humor is situational. Kenny in hell, Stan's quest for the clitoris. They're running gags but they hold up as plot points. And Cartman, the experiment of parental control by direct grafting of a V-Chip inside him that shocks him any time he swears.The humor works as long as you don't get offended by it and there's enough offensive material to get under a lot of people's skin. But this is a great film to stop thinking and just laugh. As I said, I'm not one for musicals but the songs had me laughing along with some hackneyed direction that made them perfect.Part of the whole South Park thing is having a laugh at your own weirdness and taking a break from being civil. Here the intensity is cranked up a few notches but in all South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut is very funny.It would have been nice with more features or commentary tracks but hey, it's still a fun film that'll teach you and your kids new and better ways of verbally abusing one another. :)Sweet!",N/A

I have such a respect and affection for the original this just seems a disjointed tack-on, I didn't care for Dawn of the Dead much either.  Too much self referential humour, it's missing the chilling and serious aspects of the original.

603830,"according to director pedro almodovar, the film talk to her is all about communication and i have to agree with him. whether or not you agree with the film's subject matter nor like the outcome of the film, i tend to think you will find talk to her a solid story through and through. from the very opening of the film to the heartfelt ending, you will be enthralled as you laugh and cry with our lead characters as their fate unfolds before our very eyes. it is almost impossible to fathom just how much talk to her will touch you or provoke you until you left the theatre and begin your journey elsewhere. while watching almodovar's latest masterpiece, i couldn't but smile when i thought how much he has evolved in his style over the years. from the comical, madcap or simply outarageous to the more melodramatic and sentimental dramas he has made recently such as all about my mother. beware, the madcap and the outrageous are still in almodovar's magical hands and probability suggests this will never change throughout the remainder of his career in filmmaking. there are so many aspects of this film which i would love to share with you but somehow i'm unable. you simply have to experience this film for yourself and i feel it's best if seen in the dark halls we still know as theatres if at all possible. i've been to see this film twice in the past two evenings and talk to her gets better with each and every viewing. i have already preordered my copy of talk to her and i cannot wait until it ships in may. in spain, almodovar is considered the GOD of spanish cinema and i don't dispute this statement.",Talk to Her
160298,"""From Here to Eternity"" is a Hollywood classic.  It may be the finest film ever about the military in peacetime. The background is Schofield Barracks, Hawaii in the Fall of 1941. That was the old ""brown boot"" Army! This reviewer is a Vietnam era vet, so I can't address the realism of the setting. Judging by the crisp dialog and snappy khaki uniforms, I'm giving the director the benefit of any doubt.  I always thought it fascinating that an Austrian born Director could be at the helm of such classics as ""High Noon"" and FHTE -in consecutive years no less. What did Mr. Zinnemann know of the Old West or the American Army? The male lead is Burt Lancaster as First Sergeant Warden, a tough but fair NCO that any enlisted man would want for his ""top"".  The second male lead is Private Prewitt, played by Montgomery Clift. Prewitt is a top bugler who isn't allowed to bugle and a top boxer who reuses to box for the company team! How that automatic conflict plays out is the heart of the movie. Another conflict is between Frank Sinatra, a happy go lucky but harmless enlisted man who trouble seems to follow and an evil Ernest Borgnine, the top MP at the Schofield stockade. Their ""dispute"" plays out too, with Clift a surprise key figure in its' ""resolution"". This reviewer believes that far too much attention has been lavished on the affair between Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, the wife of the Company Commander.  I found it hard to swallow that any serious career man would run around openly with an officer's wife. Lancaster was one step away from a bust down to the lowest private and a trip to the stockade. The real female star here was Donna Reed, a bar ""hostess' who would be a prostitute in real life. Her sensitivity toward Clift produces some of the best scenes in FHTE. Someone must have agreed because Donna walked off with the Best Supporting Actress Oscar- and promptly fainted after receiving it.  The interplay between Lancaster/Kerr and Clift/Reed caused some huge challenges for the Director in making the bawdy best selling novel ""clean"" for the silver screen in the still conservative, prudish America of 1953. FHTE also contains some of the sharpest dialog and one liners this reviewer can remember. Two favorites: ""Never disturb a man when he's drinking"" (Lancaster) and ""No one lies about being lonely""(Clift). In addition to Reed, Oscars were awarded for Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Film Editing, Cinematography and Supporting Actor, (Sinatra). The last two are important: FHTE revived Frank's career. Many believe that ""pressure"" was applied to Harry Cohn and Columbia Pictures to hire Sinatra. Do we remember the ""horses head in the bed"" scene from Godfather I? Others claim that his then wife, Ava Gardner, supplied the ""influence"". Finally FHTE is yet another example of why black and white classics should not be colorized. If there is such a thing as ""beautiful black and white"", it is this one. ....",N/A

597773,"In a seemengly endless parade of mob movies, ""Road to Perdition"" stands out as the most moralistic. It shows, overall, that at the heart of every mob movie, there is a heart. Though masterfully directed by American Beauty director Sam Mendes, with stunning visuals and an intellegent script, ""Road to Perdition"" fails on a few levels, which keeps it from being the masterpiece it might have been.Tom Hanks plays a family man who belongs to two different families, his wife and kids, and as a hitman for his ""father"" (Paul Newman) who is the patriarch of a poweful mob family. Things get heated when his 12 year old son witnesses a hit gone wrong, and a contract is put out on Hanks and his family. They embark on a road trip to escape the mob, save their lives, and start someting new. Hanks's motivation is at the heart of this movie- he doesn't want his son to wind up like him.While this is definitely a great idea on paper, it somewhat suffers in the execution. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, leaving little to sympathize with. The mob family loyalty was not played on as strongly as it could, and the drama was lukewarm at best, relying more on gun battles than character development. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are excellent actors, but their performances here cannot be considered career highlights. Hanks in particular plays a wooden character, and his performance strikes me as a man who would rather be doing something else. The only real standout performance is from Jude Law, who plays a creepy hitman with a morbid obsession for photographing his victims. While I liked the idea, the movie is altogether unsatisfying, for the sole reason that it could have been so much better.The movie might not be a masterpiece, but the Commentary on the DVD is worth the price of admission. Sam Mendes gives some fun and intellegent insight into the movie, how it was made, and gives plenty of interesting anecdotes along the way. The deleted scenes are nothing special, but the ""Making of"" documentary is enjoyable enough. If you liked the movie, the DVD is a nice companion.While this is far from a bad film, it simply doesn't live up to it's potential. It is perhaps this reason why it didn't get much attention at the Oscars. For some, this is a good twist on the classic mob story, but next time I am in the mood I'll grab my copy of ""The Godfather"" instead.",N/A

587318,"Few films polarize audiences like David Lynch`s Mulholland Drive.  The vast majority of average filmgoers will be unsatisfied with this movie, because it is unconventional to the point of confusion.  Some viewers don't see this as a problem, however, calling the movie  ""eerie,"" ""provocative,"" and ""cerebral.""People who are fans of Lynch have a thirst for the challenge of traditional aesthetics and the disruption of the conventional rules for watching films.  As a study of art, Mulholland Drive is rich and fascinating.  As a motion picture, however, it just does not work.Hollywood produces many films that are hard to understand at first (Momento, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc).  Each subsequent viewing helps clear the muddiness.  Mulholland Drive, on the other hand, becomes more confusing.  The harder you try to understand it, the more frustrated you will become.When the traditional filmgoer sees this movie, the viewing is as difficult as someone who enjoys landscape paintings first encountering the art of Andy Warhol.  The experience is totally foreign.  Unless you have a background in some form of art analysis and admire works labeled  ""Post-Modern"" or ""Avant-Gaurde,"" I would not suggest this film.  Those who do love ""art for art's sake"" will call this the best film of 2001.  Therefore, the question of whether you should see Mulholland Drive really is contingent on your own expectations.  I expect a movie to by marginally comprehendible, and so, I found the viewing to be less than enjoyable.",Mulholland Drive

Return of the Living Dead contains the perfect blend of comedy, horror, and gore.  Couple that with a cast of a few pretty decent actors and you have a winner which is exactly what this movie is!  It all starts when an unknown chemical (unknown until part 3 which was really lame) that has the ability to reanimate the dead is released in a medical supply warehouse and, well, reanimates a cadaver as well as some split dogs.  They take the cadaver, by now cut into pieces, to a crematory across the street that is operated by a friend of the owner of the medical supply warehouse and convince him to burn it for them.  The smoke releases the chemical into the air which causes it to rain and soak into the ground of the cemetery bring the dead back to life.  Throw in a group of punk kids (no really they are punks with mohawks and everything) who are hanging out at the cemetery waiting for their friend who works at the medical warehouse where it all started to get off work and you have the makings for some genuine mayhem.

603386,"I am astonished at how good ""Far From Heaven"" is in all categories: screenplay, direction, themes, acting, locations, and design. It's just triumphant in all respects, especially considering it's a genre that Hollywood seems to have lost the blueprints for in the early sixties, back when anything unconventional became the norm to explore and movies about domestic travail of the bourgeoisie were DONE, already.Although not a direct replica, the director modeled his overall style after the idiosyncratic 1950s film director Douglas Sirk, who was known for domestic melodrama such as ""All that Heaven Allows"" and ""Written on the Wind."" (Notice similarity between name of first film and this one.) Fortunately for us, citizens as well as moviegoers here in the 2000s are freer to examine topics that could only be alluded to 45 years ago: homosexuality and racial interraction.How long has it been since a TV show or movie came along set in the Fifties that was sincere about itself? ""Happy Days"" was an amusingly exaggerated notion of the Fifties, nothing more. ""Pleasantville"" was an excellent movie with a serious social topic (racism), but at heart its gimmick was camp science fiction, the notion that Nineties kids have to be sucked into an old Fifties sitcom to make sense of their lives.Indeed, since the mid-1970s an easy way to get laughs is to rip off the Eisenhower decade through simple parody, as when Beaver shoots Eddie Haskell on a late-night parody of ""Leave it to Beaver"", or the lazy rage for mock-retro TV advertisements.But after beating up the Fifties for 25 years, the Fifties have turned tail and beat ME up. Excellent ""Far from Heaven,"" set in Hartford, Connecticut in 1957, came along and hit me in the head like a tennis mallet. Dennis Quaid stretches himself to the max as a midlevel TV company sales exec who is drifting farther and farther away from his family because of work commitments but mostly from his growing attraction toward sex--the same sex. He tries to quell his guilt with alternate bouts of rage and alcohol then makes things worse when he goes into therapy with the most modern kind of psychiatrist of the day, a strict conversion-oriented Freudian. Nothing could be worse.At home, the amazing, versatile Julianna Moore plays the wife. In good Fifties housewife style, her character tries for, and succeeds at, the difficult balancing act of making the house look as though it were running itself, while at the same time hosting daiquri-driven ""puncheons"" for her friends and no-holds-barred parties for Hartford's upper-middle-class, even at the same time holding up the social scene and the arts. Like the graceful swan, she must look stately above water while paddling like hell underneath to keep afloat, but we can't condemn her because her motives are well-meaning, not hypocritical. She knows perfectly well these fatuous social gestures complement and keep afloat her husband's career at TV-manufacturer ""Magnatech.""Alcohol, money worries, stress, and even her husband's ambivalent sexuality are not the lady's immediate worries: her chief antagonist is the set she runs with. Free spirits are slaughtered; conformits stay alive. That much we all know about the Fifties, but HOW that occurs and the WAY in which its citizens were so damaged is fascinating, especially with such terrific direction, acting, and a good taut script. Turns out that her husband's gayness (a very non-Fifties term) throws the family into crisis, but her having a friendly relationship with an African-American gardener throws the smart set into a frenzy. So much for Yankee tolerance. Ironically, all this is played out against President Eisenhower's attempt to desegregate the public schools of Little Rock, Arkansas. Wonder which is worse: mean and forthright or mean and genteel?Only people ""of a certain age"" will remember this time and milieu well, but those who have affirm that this superb film's rendering of a bygone era is scrupulous. This writer--a real meanie when it comes to looking for anachronisms and continuity error--was informed of one by a friend: a container of nutmeg had a plastic top. Shhhh! I myself am puzzled about how some of the vaster effects were obtained. A 1950s passenger train with coaches that wouldn't have survived Amtrak? Oh, one or two from a museum, but a whole train?Not just material things, but things visual: how on earth did ""Far from Heaven"" cough up a tracking shot that covers an entire town? Oh, a neighborhood is easy enough, but a whole town? (Several Jersey suburbs lent their exteriors to this production). Entire fleets of vintage cars? Much skill, craft and inspiration must have gone into this movie--and a lotta dough. My thanks go to Steven Soderberg and George Clooney, executive producers. Your courage won't be forgotten.Unless you'd absolutely despise a serious movie set in the year 1957 with blazingly brilliant fall color and top-notch acting, I'd more than highly recommend ""Far from Heaven."" In my opinion it's one of 2002's very best.PS:  In a superlative year, it's a pity this film had to be overlooked in the wake of other such superlative films as CHICAGO.  An embarrasment of riches!

295657,"JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH -- given that among its stars is Pat Boone, and among its special effects are live lizards with rubber fins attached -- is a far better movie than one would expect, even today.  It appeared about a year after special effects extravaganza 7th VOYAGE OF SINBAD, and about a year before the enlarged-lizard silliness with Claude Raines, Jill St. John, and Fernando Lamas in a remake of the THE LOST WORLD -- and yet JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH still works pretty well as entertainment for today's audience.  Of course, JOURNEY also was a product of the heyday of some of the successful Disney live-action family adventures, which this movie probably most closely resembles.JOURNEY has a good story and some interesting music going for it -- and this is probably the only film using live lizards as dinosaurs where the lizards, with sails atop their backs, actually look something like the dimetrodons they are supposed to represent (if a bit too large).Even Pat Boone is good in this movie, as is pretty much everyone else.  James Mason is ideal and at least as well cast as he was in 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, and when a redhead lady in a girdle, a Swede with no lines, a goose, and a dastardly villain play your emotions with equal success (and no snickering), you know someone has gotten the tone right.The widescreen and color are excellent.  The DVD presentation manages to preserve the color well, by the way (the movie has a rather wondrously gaudy look, for a film that takes place mostly in caves (!), and the Technicolor seems to have been well preserved).In short, a film that is audacious in scope from a time that produced a number of movies that seem dated today holds up surprisingly well and is still a fun adventure diversion.",Journey to the Center of the Earth VHS

787260,"""Out of Time"" is a nice little exercise of the crackerjack plot, an entirely forgettable wrong-guy-accused yarn fit for its day in court some HBO Saturday night. But what is it doing as a big budget thriller? And what is Denzel Washington doing within 100 yards of it?Not that Washington, now with two Oscars, hasn't slummed before - ""Fallen"" and ""John Q"" come to mind - but Dave Collard's script is too thin and Carl Franklin's direction too hurried for the movie to be anything more than a passing thought. And the casting is something else: Washington is forced to play love interest to Sanaa Lathan and Eva Mendes, women 17 and 20 years his junior. Washington has impressive range, but who knew the Ralph Macchio role was part of it?The plot in a quickie: Washington is Matt Whitlock, a newly separated, small-town Florida cop in an affair with his high school sweetheart Anne Marei (Lathan) whose abusive husband (Dean Cain) is a former quarterback out of cash. During one afternoon tryst, Anne Marei takes Matt to the doctor with her, where he learns she has terminal cancer. After some stomach churning, Matt steals a half-million in confiscated drug money to help her pay for the alternative treatment in Switzerland.The night she's to pick it up, she doesn't show. The next morning her house has burned down. And Matt's slated as beneficiary to her life insurance policy. Another complication: Matt's soon-to-be-ex-wife, Alex (Mendes), is the lead homicide detective on the case.""Out of Time"" then shifts into a game of Matt eliminating clues that point to his guilt, tracking the source of the setup - a shiny nickel if you can guess that one - and taking an afternoon siesta to reminisce with Alex. Franklin zips through the material in an attempt to gloss over a criminal plan that not only doesn't hold up but never made sense in the first place.In what is essentially an asexual role, Washington generates no heat with Mendes or Lathan. Mendes is naturally likable and good-looking in a Jennifer Lopez kind of way, but Alex and Matt's marriage is built on moviesphere, nothing more.Beyond that, when it is ever good to take the smartest guy in the picture and figure him for a mark? If that actor is, say, Nicolas Cage, who can play loose and goose, that one's thing. But Washington sweats smarts, and while ""Out of Time"" shows Matt as light on his feet, it first must establish him as a dope - and a heel.",Out Of Time
706935,"One of the lessons of this production of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is that a good story can forgive many things.  I mean, the special effects of this 1988 adaptation are pretty much on a par with ""Barney,"" which is most apparent every time one of the hand drawn animations appears.  However, they are done in the style of Pauline Baynes, the original illustrator of this classic tale by C.S. Lewis, which amply evidences that whatever budgetary considerations the hearts, minds and souls of the producers were in the right place.  The costumes of the talking animals and the soldiers of Narnia are all pretty good, as are the simple sets (clearly where the money went), but the proof of the pudding here is obviously going to be Aslan.  We are talking minimalistic animatronics here, but it all works.  Mainly that is because the four children who meet up with the great lion who rules over Narnia clearly believe in him and accept him, which is all the magic that is needed.  The result is admittedly not great, but it is very good, and, most importantly, it is in the spirit of the original story.""The Chronicles of Narnia"" have their origin in the Second World War when Hitler's Luftwaffe was subjecting London to the blitz and the city's children were evacuated to the country for safety.  Four such children ended up at the Kilns, the Oxford home of C.S. Lewis, where they were entertained by the stories he told to them.  In 1950 Lewis published ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,"" the first of the seven tales that would made up ""The Chronicles of Narnia.""  The tales hold their own as adventures for children, who get to use magic and fight with swords, but there is also a wonderful amount of depth only available to adults who are wise enough to look at such things.That was because Lewis was not just an acclaimed author of children's literature; he was also a distinguished Oxbridge literary scholar and critic and a popular writer and broadcaster of Christian apologetics.  While clearly Lewis carved out a distinguished career as a novelist, scholar, and theologian with three decidedly different audiences, it is equally obvious that a full appreciation of any of his writings is impossible without recognizing the elements of his other personas.  Certainly there are Christians who would be troubled by Lewis's incorporation of talking animals, witches and other fairy folk into his fictional tales, but ultimately the potency of this tales from a theological perspective is his ability to make it all work.  Besides, the fact that the children one day become too old to return to Narnia but are expected never to forget the lesson learned there is something like a broad hint as to how this is all supposed to work out.The story tells of Lucy (Sophie Wilcox), Peter (Richard Dempsey), Susan (Sophie Cook), and Edmund (Jonathan R. Scott), who are sent off to the country home of Professor Kirke (Michael Aldridge) during the war.  On a rainy day they explore the old home and Lucy enters a large old wardrobe in the attic to discover it opens into a fantastic world of mythological creatures and talking animals, all under the spell of eternal winter cast by the White Witch (Barbara Kellerman).  Lucy is not believed when she returns, for time passes differently in Narnia, but eventually they all end up in the wondrous world.  There the White Witch gets Edmond to betray his siblings and their newfound friends in Narnia with promises of Turkish Delight treats.  But against here is Aslan, the brave lion king who returns to save his people and the land of Narnia.  Not surprising, the story rests on the importance of acts of sacrifice and salvation.This was the third television version of ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" and the best of the bunch.  The children are believable as such, whether acting horrible towards one another or behaving heroically on behalf of the people are Narnia.  It is that believability that the cast brings to the production and the fidelity to the original story that makes this work, especially for children.  A new production is slated to be made in 2004 and the improvements in special effects are such that you would have to think that there will be noticeable improvements over the 1988 version.  But if it fails to be true to the original story and loses the sense of believability at the heart of this production, any improved special effects will come to naught.",N/A

Biko is more than lucky to have a friend, a white man who is  conscious and empathic journalist, Donald Woods, and who stands behind all Biko's activities and by this Biko gained more popularity.Anyways it doesn't take long for the south african government to get rido of Biko forever and it is then when the white man D.Woods has to sacrifice his beautiful life in South Africa in order to reveal the truth to the world about Biko's murder.A great movie by all means. Biko and Woods are two people that I'll never forget for their brave hearts.",N/A
256872,"&quot;Cover Girl&quot; is a star vehicle for Rita Hayworth.  Having stated the obvious, its quick paced and elegant good fun, bookended by Gene Kelly's superb dancing and Eve Arden's &quot;hotter than fire&quot; one-liners.  Rita is cast as a nobody who gets her face plastered on one magazine and overnight becomes the toast of Broadway.  Her duet with Kelly, &quot;Long Ago and Far Away&quot; is the real highlight in this nimble minded programmer that really took audiences by storm. - people used to be so easy to please!TRANSFER: Well, what do you know?  After a slew of bargain basement trasfers (though by no means was Columbia's pricing what this reviewer would consider a bargain) we at last get a transfer that's worthy of the digital format.  Colors are vibrant and well balanced. Contrast and black levels are bang on. Film grain and age related artifacts are present but they don't terribly distract.  There are no digital compression artifacts.  The audio is MONO but nicely balanced.EXTRAS: Forget it! Columbia remains on their penny-pinching kick, but hey - at least the film looks good.BOTTOM LINE: This is not an outstanding example of the Hollywood musical.  However, it is adept at poking fun at itself and having a good time doing it. For a night of light fluff that will put a smile on your face, I recommend &quot;Cover Girl&quot;.",Cover Girl VHS

This is the first comedy movie written by Woodie Allen and it shows great hand crafting with many little details. There are several sub plots that interweave and come together in the last 15 minutes. One of the most amusing parts is the famous homosexual woman, Capucine, playing a heterosexual nymphomaniac.",What's New Pussycat VHS
732987,"Your sure to love every episode of Matt Groening's greatest series, of course next to many of the Simpson episodes.One thing that this series of cartoons had going for it, was that it hit the trail running with loads of laughs right from episode one.  Not like many other series on TV, which can take a season or two (sometimes 3 or 4) to really start to pick up a fan base and have good stories to really keep you coming back for more.The disappointing fact about the series right now was all the confusing speculation of it getting canceled.  We only have the Fox executive idiots to blame for that.  I guess it was too good for them to try and keep it going much.  And don't let them tell you that ratings never really took off for it.  They were the problem, what with them moving it around and it constantly getting pre-empted by stupid sports and other programs.  Those of us fans who wanted to make sure we could watch every episode every time, were always waiting with baited breath to see if it was actually gonna show up each week.  Basically it was put into an odd cycle of maybe on for a week or two, then off for 3 or 4 weeks, then maybe one episode again and off for another 2 or 3, and so on and so on and so on.  You couldn't really tell.  And moving it to different days now and then didn't help either.  They never really gave it much chance.  Despite the fact it still has such a fan base all over the place.  So feel free to make your major complaints to the Fox ding bats about their abilities to organize and stick with a schedule for once.The only thing not good about this DVD set is it only has 13 episodes.  Really guys, you could have included more, but I guess maybe they wanted to just test the water and see if the DVD would fly.  But also having released a general date for the 2nd season already, gives you an indication they want to maybe try and crank them out to try and shovel in the money.  Finally they want to try and release there products out to the general market on a more faster basis and not make us just sit on our hands.  Like the Simpson's episodes.  They hardly let anything out on VHS for years and years, and a few years back they started releasing a few favorite compilations, which didn't take off too well.  We were waiting for whole season sets.  And finally they got into DVD for one season, and then finally last year they got around to the second season.  But of course I don't really see them flying off the shelves, being it's just that, the first 2 seasons.  They were fine and dandy at the time, but seem more dry and stale compared to the newer episodes now a days.  Which brings me back to the point of Futurama having such great laughs from episode one and haven't stopped.  Who knows what goes through the brains of Fox Executives (other than a brick that is, LOL).Enjoy all the Laughs!  And be sure to let everyone at Cartoon Network know how much you love Futurama, to keep them going on that network for years to come.  Who know's, maybe we could encourage them to pick it up and produce it themselves in some licensing deal, and we could get loads of more laughs.

453031,"After the fiasco that was Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, Miramax/Dimension films decided to steer the series in a Scream like direction with this seventh (and second for Miramax/Dimension) film in the series.  Jamie Lee Curtis makes her return (the last time she was seen was Halloween 2) as Laurie who now has a son (Josh Hartnett) and is an alcoholic to boot.  When Michael comes calling we see the aggressive side of Laurie that we never got to see which is refreshing, and it is good to see her and Mike go at it, but the rest of the film is just standard modern day post-Scream teeniebopper unscary horror mixed with the stalk &amp; slash routines of the 80's.  Veteran horror director Steve Miner (who helmed the second and third installemnts in the Friday the 13th series as well as House) gives Michael the most character he's had in years, but what is with Mike's mask?  I mean we can see his eyes as clear as day, when did that happen last?  The rest of the semi-well known cast includes Alan Arkin, Michelle Williams, LL Cool J, and Curtis' real life mom Janet Leigh in a cameo.  All in all, Halloween H2O is lackluster at best, but it is a much better entry than Halloween 6 and Resurrection.",Halloween H20 VHS
667518,"It is what it is, and you certainly don't have to like it(Roger Ebert sure hates Pink Flamingos, but what does he know?  He liked Star Kid).  John Waters is truly a love him or hate him guy, especially where his old films are concerned.  If you've never seen this, take my advice:  Don't watch it with anyone prudish(unless it's for revenge), watch it with a sick freaky person like yourself.  This is the kind of film that you like to watch with people to see their reactions, but you probably won't watch it alot on your own-very much like Caligula.  Remember, Waters isn't afraid to show you anything and nothing is sacred to him.  There are at least two scenes in Pink Flamingos that will be tattooed in your brain till the day you die(for better or worse), so be prepared.  This film is labeled a comedy, but that's all a matter of taste.  I know people who DO NOT think this film is funny, but very sick and disturbing.  You gotta understand that it's all meant for laughs, but many aren't gonna agree with that, Bubba.  Female Trouble is a little more toned down than Pink Flamingos, but not much!

106639,"OK, I have to be honest here:  I don't like &quot;family entertainment.&quot;  If I go to Blockbuster, I usually avoid the Family section entirely for something a bit edgier or darker.  And although I love Fred Astaire and most Gene Kelly, I am not at all a fan of Hollywood musicals from the fifties and early sixties, when they were becoming more &quot;epic&quot; as the movies tried to provide something that television could not.Nonetheless, I find THE MUSIC MAN to be one of the most thoroughly enjoyable pieces of light entertainment ever.  Primarily there are two reasons for this.  First, there is the great score, the most famous tune notwithstanding (maybe I have heard it too often, but &quot;Seventy-Six Trombones&quot; really leaves me cold).  But nearly every other song is utterly delightful, especially the magnificent &quot;Till There Was You.&quot;  Am I a dork if I confess that I love the barbershop quartet numbers (I was second tenor in a high school quartet)?  But as fine as the score is, take away Robert Preston and you have at best an average, forgettable film.  Preston today is remembered almost exclusively for his role as Professor Harold Hill, which is a reflection not so much on his prior career as on the extraordinary job he did in performing this role.  There is a similar parallel with Rex Harrison, who despite a long career on stage and screen, is primarily remembered for MY FAIR LADY.  Interestingly, in both MY FAIR LADY and THE MUSIC MAN, other actors were considered for the lead role, although both Preston and Harrison created the roles for Broadway.  Interestingly, Cary Grant was considered for both films (though Grant very famously responded that he wouldn't star in the film and if Preston weren't cast in the lead, he wouldn't even go see it), though Warners first choice was Frank Sinatra.  Luckily, things worked out, and Robert Preston &quot;owns&quot; the role of Professor Harold Hill like few actors own a role.The film is also helped by a rich supporting cast.  Shirley Jones was her usual excellent self in the film (though it is well known that she was pregnant during the shooting), and the film provided the late Buddy Hackett with one of his finest screen roles.  Paul Ford, best known as the colonel on the Phil Silvers Show, turns in a nice screen performance as the Mayor.  Hermione Gingold, who spent most of her career on stage and had as a result a surprisingly small screen career, excels as the mayor's wife and the leading light for culture in the town.But mainly, this is a great, great vehicle for a great leading man who has utterly nailed a great role.  If Frank Sinatra or Cary Grant had been enticed to play the lead, perhaps we would still be watching this film today, but for some reason I am sceptical.  But I am certain that this is one family film that all but the hardest of hearts will enjoy.",N/A

778763,"I had previously reviewed the theatrical production of Assassination Tango when it was shown in theaters.  I liked the movie so much that I ordered the DVD. The DVD arrived on Saturday, December 13th. It is obvious that I liked the movie.  However, the DVD exceeded my expecations.  First of all, the movie is there with picture and sound presentation.  It is, of course, available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.  In addition, there are subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French.In addition to the movie presentation, there is also a presentation of the movie with an audio commentary while the movie is being shown on a scene-by-scene basis by Robert Duvall and Luciana Pedraza.  They comment on who the characters (personajes) are  in the picture, the actors who played them including some facts about their lives, how the secene was shot and why the scene was shot in that manner, etc.  As you know, the whole premise of the movie was to have a movie about Tango.  The aspect of assassination and organized crime was just a way to tie an American who was not a tanguero into the action.  You already know that Robert Duvall had been in the Godfather movies and that Francis Ford Copolla was involved both with the Godfather and with Assassination Tango.  The audio commentary brings together some discussion of the mafia in New York into the development of John J.  Minor characters in the movie included Reuben Blades, a Panamanian living in Los Angeles, Julio Oscar Pedroso, a Cuban actor, and Raul Outeada who had been an Argentine boxer (the equivalent of Frankie Gio).  General Rojas, the general who was to be assassinated, was played by Elvio Nessier, an Argentine actor who has had a distinguished career in repertory theater.I was pleased to see some favorite tango people including Maria Nieves,  Melina Plebs and Ezequel Farfaro, Carlos Copello, and Pablo Veron.  I have had lessons with most of those people.  We also noted seeing Adolfo (Jerry) Alonso and his wife Joji Alonso, who tangueros from Baltimore, in a background scene in a practica.In addition to the movie and commentary, there was a presentation on the music in Assassination Tango, including the original music written by Luis Bacalov, an Argentine expatriot living in Rome.  Bacalov is best known for the music to Missa Tango, Tangosain, and the Academy Award for the music in &quot;Il Postino.&quot;I liked the movie and would recommend it not just to tangueros.  Some people are reluctant to buy a video even after they have seen the movie in a theater. I felt that the DVD offered me the ability to see more of the movie that I missed the first time and also gave me the additional &quot;value added&quot; feature of the commentary from Duvall and Pedraza, the omitted scenes, and the alternative ending.",N/A

592448,"Hollywood has had a long fascination with BBM (Big Bug Movies). Usually, such monstrosities were the result of man's fooling around with forbidden experiments.  The tone that the director usually took was in grimmest earnest.  In films like THEM and THE THING, the local population had to band together in mutual self-defense while suffering heavy casualties before the Bright Eyed Handsome Scientist figured out how to whack the creature.  In EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS, director Ellory Elkayem continues the time-honored tradition of presenting a host of mutant bugs--this time spiders--but infusing the film with a much needed breath of humor.  Only one human really gets killed, thereby allowing the audience to focus on the odd melding of horror with humor.  David Arquette plays a returning prodigal son who left town years ago, pining in unrequited love for Samantha (Kari Wuhrer--of SLIDERS fame), the tough talking but fiercely built sherrif who, of course, refuses to believe in the existence of oversized spiders until one literally jumps on her.  The real stars are the leaping arachnids themselves, with each one the size of a VW Beetle, capable of leaping incredibly long distances.  In matters of pure science, the Inverse Square Law forbids any such bugs from expanding in size while retaining their proportional mobility, yet, I was fascinated with the computer-enhanced special effects (at least I hope it was special effects) that permitted a horde of them from descending on a sleepy town.  Whenever a BBM has a pint-sized geeky teen backing up the hero, then you know that the entire production is one continuous inside joke.  There is a succession of allusions to other BBM.  Director Elkayem even shows a few scenes of attacking ants from THEM. Later he gives the arachnids the ability to squeal in the manner of the furballs of GHOULIES.  The thrill of this movie is not diluted by a predictable plot. Paradoxically, since the focus is more on humor than horror, then it can allow itself to be a self-conscious parody of many prior BBMs.  By the time you get to the closing credits, you don't care that what you saw was as far removed from arachnid anatomy as Spiderman was from a real spider.  All you know is that you found out that only the very best of BBMs allow you to laugh and cry at the same time.",N/A

539882,"Doug Liman has crafted an immensly watchable spy thriller with The Bourne Identity. If you're a fan of the book, unlearn what you have learned and enjoy the movie for what it is. Matt Damon shows us again that he is a gifted actor in giving the character of Jason Bourne a life that other actors may have just sleepwalked through. It must truly stink waking up one day and not know who you are. But to find that you can kick the stuffing out of two armed cops without breaking a sweat? That must be simply disturbing and Damon pulls it off without seeming to break a sweat himself.And let us not forget outstanding supporting work from Franke Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen and the always dependable Brian Cox. These guys elevate this movie from what would have been an entertaining action flick into a great action flick.The DVD is... okay, I guess. It's always nice to see some deleted scenes. The alternate ending isn't as alternate as it could have been (same result, different type of execution). The making of featurette is just that, a bit of a fluff piece that touches on some stuff, but never really goes deeper. The commentary by Liman is nice and imformative. He answers some stuff you may have been thinking about, like why is Julia Stiles in such a small role in the movie (when they were actually shooting the movie, she wasn't quite a name yet).Not exactly the best in the special features department, but the movie looks and sounds great. That added to the fact that it is simply an extremely cool movie makes it a must buy on DVD.",N/A

Hopper plays a sheriff seeking revenge against the infamous cannibal family for the deaths of his brother's children, and Caroline Williams plays a radio DJ the family kidnaps after she hears them {murder} a couple of yuppies.  The performances are crazed (Hopper is his usual bare bone psycho self), and the film is laugh out loud hilarious and ludicrous at the same time.

101048,"Adapted with the help of famous astronomer Carl Sagan from his book of the same title, CONTACT brilliantly brings to life the fictional story of astro-physicist Ellie Arroway (Foster) whose passion for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is matched only by her resoursefulness. She is instilled with a sense of wonder about the universe by her adoring father, a widower raising her alone until his untimely death when Ellie is only 9. She finds no comfort in the words of the minister who advises that she must accept his death as God's will. As an adult, she chooses to eschew religion and devotes her energies to the pursuit of science. When she meets and is attracted to Palmer Joss (McConaughey), a religious scholar, there is a clash over issues of faith.The plot revolves around  contact with an intelligent civilization many light years away that transmits blueprints for a machine of unknown purpose. But the strength of the story is the very well developed central character and Jody Foster's emotional portrayal of her (and Jena Malone does a wonderful job as the young Ellie). The story's lofty contemplations on faith vs. science and the implications for our planet of the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence lift this film above most other sci-fi. It also contains one of my favorite examples of imaginative cinematography. In a scene in which 9 yr. old Ellie discovers her father unconscious on the 1st floor, she races upstairs to get his medicine from the bathroom. In one continuous shot the camera tracks just ahead of and looking back at Ellie, from the 1st floor, up the stairs, turns down a hallway and into the bathroom. When she reaches for the medicine cabinet, you see that you have been looking into the reflection of the cabinet mirror the whole time. But of course, there is no way you could literally see Ellie's reflection in that mirror from the start of the shot, which began at the bottom of the stairs.",Contact
756680,"Salom&eacute; is an unusual silent film. It is unconventional and quite strange and has far too many titles, particularly at the beginning. But whatever flaws it may have, these can easily be forgiven for it is a fascinating film. The story begins with a feast where King Herod is shown lusting after his stepdaughter Salom&eacute;. She is more fascinated with Herod's prisoner Jokanaan (John the Baptist). Salom&eacute; uses her seductive charms to arrange a meeting with Jokanaan, but when he rejects her love her jealously leads her onto the path of revenge. Herod is so smitten that he will grant her any favour if only she will dance for him. Salom&eacute; agrees to dance, but the bargain will have unforeseen consequences.Nazimova is very good indeed as Salom&eacute;. She is somehow remarkably convincing as a teenage girl. This is all the more surprising for Nazimova was in her forties when she played the part. Her acting is subtle, making good use of facial expressions and gestures to convey the nature of the character. It is easy to believe in Salom&eacute;'s powers of seduction, for Nazimova is stunning to look at and very sexy in the costumes she wears. She was clearly no dancer, but nevertheless her dance is imaginative and effective. As a teasing temptress she is perfect.The film has some fairly bizarre moments and some of the acting is rather broad, but the story is told well and the sets and costumes are very good. The tinted print on the Image DVD is, on the whole, good to very good. At various point it shows some signs of decay, but this decomposition is quite minor. The picture has good clarity with lots of detail. The DVD has a choice of two scores. The orchestral score by Marc-Olivier Dupin, fits the mood and the action of the film and is a pleasure to listen to. The other option is a more contemporary sounding score by the Silent Orchestra. I preferred the Dupin score, but both scores are worth listening to and it is great to have a choice.I didn't enjoy the second film on this DVD very much at all. Lot in Sodom runs just under half an hour and is weird and bizarre without really being particularly interesting. It is almost silent with only a few pieces of dialogue. The difficulty I had with the film is that it is pretty hard to follow. It is full of hallucinatory images and strange camera angles, but you really have to know the Old Testament story to have any idea what is going on. It is fairly explicit for a thirties film with glimpses of nudity, but for all that is nowhere near as sexy as Salom&eacute;. Lot in Sodom does have some striking images and it is clear that a lot of effort and thought went into the making of the film, but as with so many experimental films the experiment ultimately fails. It fails because the film is so confusing that it is neither thought provoking nor entertaining. Others may like this film more than I did in which case they will be pleased that the print and sound quality are above average for a film from 1933. Even if I didn't much care for Lot in Sodom, I was still very pleased with this DVD as Salom&eacute; is full of interest and a lot of fun.",Salome / Lot in Sodom

I LOVED Christina, her romance with William, and felt sad for Violet and the stableman Dick. My only problem with Flambards at all was the SOUNDTRACK. There is some awful 'seventies' style disco music which has people actually singing: ""Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom"" and whistling cheerily throughout. This was... Well, quite frankly awful, and did not suit such a well-done period piece.Plotwise: I also felt William was a bit too obsessed with planes. Everything was about 'him' and his desire to achieve HIS dream. When it came to Christina and HER interests he scoffed and picked at her love of horses. Christina, of course was VERY tolerant, loving and considerate. I wonder if William would be so tolerant if it was HIS interests were the ones being constantly ridiculedOverall, a great series the entire family will enjoy.",Flambards Collection Set VHS

Three of these titles are personal favorites and the fourth (Cave Dwellers) has some good momemts.Angels Revenge: What do you get when you add 7 busty babes, the skipper (Alan Hale), Mr. Haney (Pat Buttram), Thurston Howell (Jim Backus), Peter Lawford and Jack Palance? A laughable piece of poorly acted fluff. The seven jump-suited hunnies (they looked like Evil Kneivel groupies) couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. The plot(?) revolves around these curvacious cuties deciding that they'd take on a drug cartel run by Peter Lawford and his main henchman Jack Palance. Mike and the bots are spot on with their riffing throughout. It makes you cringe seeing poor Jim Backus, a beloved character, sentenced to do this movie.Cave Dwellers: Stars Miles O'Keefe in your typical low budget sword & sorcery flic. The movie is slow, confusing, and poorly acted but the segments by Joel & bots are priceless. In particular, their version of the movie's opening sequence with credits.Pod People: What a disjointed collection of celluloid! The movie jumps around more than a jackrabbit on pcp. The story, such as it is, starts with a light in the sky crashing to earth. Three poachers cross paths with some goofy looking alien. Of course these dullards try to kill these long snouted bipedal creatures. A small boy with an annoying voice finds an alien egg and decides to take it home. It hatchs and lil' Trumpy is born. Meanwhile, the movie goes way out in leftfield by jumping to some putrid ""rock"" group singing the most incomprehensible song. Oh forget it!

716660,"Everybody knows who Goofy is, but which Goofy?The best thing about this entry in the outstanding Walt Disney Treasures collection is tracing the evolution of the character from a naive country bumpkin to a harried suburban ... well, bumpkin. While Mickey Mouse remained essentially a static, one-note character throughout his cinematic career, Goofy demonstrated an expanding range of characterizations unmatched in motion picture history until Tom Hanks went from &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; to &quot;Philadelphia.&quot;OK, maybe that's overstating things a bit, but it is fun watching the various periods of the character, my favorite being the 1940's &quot;How To ...&quot; series (the scene in &quot;The Olympic Champ&quot; when the narrator breaks into poetry while poor pole-vaulting Goofy tries to keep his balance is classic).And it's good to see a cartoon like &quot;No Smoking,&quot; with Goofy portrayed as a hopeless nicotine addict, escape from the Disney conglomerate unedited.Yes, I regret the decision not to include a Play All feature, and I'd rather have the feature about Pinto Colvig be twice as long as it is, and the one about Bill Farmer be half as long as it is.

201319,"At long last, &quot;Coal Miner's Daughter&quot; has come to DVD. This biopic tells the tale of country music legend Loretta Lynn, spanning her early years of poverty in Butcher Holler, Kentucky through her steady rise to fame and fortune to become the queen of country music. The film details the highs and lows of that journey with both heartfelt humor and pathos and contains incredible performances from the entire cast.One need not be a fan of Loretta or country music to enjoy this film. Director Michael Apted has crafted a movie of depth, detail and emotion, especially in the early scenes which depict Loretta's early years growing up dirt poor in the Appalachian mountains. Apted's attention to detail allows the viewer to really understand what it was like to grow up in such an impoverished environment. Apted obviously respected the material he was working with and does it justice.Sissy Spacek, as Loretta, is simply superb. Earning a well deserved Oscar for this performance, she is never less than captivating. Starting out as a shy, naive 14 year old, then slowly building confidence and self-awareness, to emotionally crumbling under pressures to great for her to handle, Sissy is completely believable in all stages of Lynn's life. On top of it all, Sissy does her own singing in the film! This is one talented woman. Tommy Lee Jones is equally compeling as Mooney, Lynn's husband, who's confidence in his young bride started it all. Jones does a great job displaying Mooney's determination, frustrations and insecurities. Also of note is Beverly D'Angelo's performance as Patsy Cline. Although she has very little screen time in the film, her impact in the overall film is undeniable. She too gives a pitch perfect performance and does all her own singing as well. Alas both Jones and D'Angelo were overlooked when the Oscar nominations were announced that year. (They were both robbed!!) These three powerhouse performances are backed up with an equally strong supporting cast, including Levon Helms and Phyllis Boyens (both of whom where not actors by trade) as Loretta's parents.The DVD provides extras such as a commentary track with Apted and Spacek (not the best commentary track I've heard but worth a listen if you like that sort of thing), interviews with both Tommy Lee Jones and Loretta Lynn (worth a peek) and a totally useless clip of President Bush (Sr. that is) saluting the AFI. He mentions the title of Coal Miner's Daughter once in his speech. That warranted it's inclusion in the DVD!!?? Alas there are no deleted scenes or &quot;making of&quot; documentaries which I enjoy watching but I don't want to sound like &quot;a big ol' bear a growlin&quot; so I won't complain.",Coal Miner's Daughter VHS

89491,"If you like Arnold, you'll like this movie. If not, not. It's that simple.This nonstop action-thriller follows the misadventures of John Kruger (Schwarzenegger), an 'eraser' with a secret witness-protection program who gets rid of all traces of a witness's previous identity. He reports to James Caan and he's assigned to protect Vanessa Williams as she rats out a megacorporation doing a dirty arms deal.That's all you need to know, and it's very nearly all there is. There's some high-tech gadgetry, some not-altogether-persuasive CGI stuff, some humor, and a whole lot of hairbreadth escapes; there's also Robert Pastorelli in a terrific supporting role, and a brief appearance by a surprisingly menacing James Cromwell. But the plot in this one _is_ the action.Perhaps the single most unconvincing portion is Caan duking it out with Schwarzenegger; in real life, Arnold would most likely have Jimmy for lunch. But Caan is terrific all the same (and if you like him, be sure to see _Rollerball_).The whole thing is well produced and most gratifying to watch. If you like a good Arnold action-thriller, you may like this one better than _True Lies_.",N/A

They know him for all of a week and suddenly they are helping him hide out after he tells them clearly that they have no idea what they are getting into.  And instead of going down the conceivable plot line that the ""American"" husband is somehow interested in the rent boy (as the plot as been leading us to believe from the beginning) instead the highly effeminate prostitute finds his joy and redemption in the arms of the wife?!?!This movie is truly bad and only good for a laugh.

I haven't had such a negative reaction to a film in ages. I had no problem with the X-rated sex scenes and the bestiality sequence was something I've never seen before so that was kind of educational. My problem was with the snuff film sequence.I'm an old gorehound and I don't shy away from this kind of material but I feel context is very important when watching good gore. I like people and I don't want them to be eaten by Zombies so when I watch say Dawn Of The Dead I want to be horrified by scenes of carnage and I want the director to tell me I should be horrified.The problem with the gore in this movie is that its context is to serve as sexual titillation. Intercutting scenes of Laura Gemser having sex while looking through a window into the torture room with scenes of women being very realistically mutilated is way to perverse for me. I'm sure that about 50% of the people who read this review will be even more likely to purchase it now but for people like me who will feel ""soiled"" after viewing this, you've been warned.My disk also arrived scratched up do to a very crappy box with sharp edges on the ""button"".

729669,"""Igby Goes Down"", in the tradition of many ""teenage boy coming of age"" movie, bearing fair comparison to ""The Graduate"" and ""Catcher in the Rye"", with moments of the blackest comedy thrown in. It is an enjoyable film, mainly for the sharpness of the performances, as well as an equally sharp script that leaves no stone unturned, nor protects anyone.It's the story of ""Igby"", so aptly nicknamed, as you will discover, whom cannot seem to get his feet firmly planted in his life. Yes, we've seen this story a thousand times, and a thousand times more. He wanders through his life, questioning everything, and everyone, under the sun; his pill-popping mother, distant brother, suspicious godfather and his trampy girlfriend, and even an odd love interest who is bitter yet reachable.Fearing falling into the cliche trap, the script bops all over the place, making for some wonderfully surprising moments. Gore Vidal as a priest! Cynthia Nixon as a [substance] abusing former teacher! Were it not so believable, you'd be spending time waiting for the next celeb cameo. However, the strength of the writing is absurdly clear, both realistic and character illuminating.Secondly, the performances stun and wonder. Kieran Culkin carries the film, making his angst believable but not overdramatic. Susan Sarandon can do no wrong, and makes the mother believable but not overdramatic. Ryan Phillipe irritates appropriately, Amanda Peet flutters through the film, and Claire Danes shines. Hook a film with a strong script and performances and you have a winner.My only worries: we've seen the angst-ridden teenager before. It seems the beginning of the film flounders a bit as Igby flounders. It was distracting, but perhaps purposefully so. I found myself fighting to get into the movie, to even care about Igby, which I so wanted to do. He eventually comes around, and you do care, but it was like climbing walls.Cheers to the filmmaker for this gutsy script, and cheers to Igby, hopefully by the end of the film, finding himself amongst the angst.",Igby Goes Down

374935,"Ty Cobb was called &quot;the greatest baseball player of all time&quot; and he enjoyed the spotlight.  He was also known as &quot;difficult person&quot; to put it mildly.  He drank hard, was prone to violence, insulted everybody, beat his wife, alienated his children, was a racist, beat a man to death and was accused of fixing games. In 1960 he had his biography written by a sportswriter named Al Stump.  At the time Al Stump wrote a flattering portrait.  Later, Stump wrote another book, telling the &quot;real&quot; story about Cobb.  And this 1994 film is based on this second book.The film is set in 1960 when Cobb, then 72 years old, engages Al Stump to write his biography.  Stump's a young sportswriter who's flattered by the assignment.  At first he hates the arrogant Cobb, but later finds himself admiring him for his &quot;bigger than life&quot; personality.  And so he winds up being Cobb's only friend, traveling with him, drinking with him and playing nursemaid to his wild rages and need for constant medication.Tommy Lee Jones is cast as Cobb, in a larger-than-life performance that humanizes the aging Cobb in spite of his raging racism and generally obnoxious behavior.  Robert Wuhl is cast as Al Stump and his performance is equally good as we see him starting to have sympathy for the aging man.  Lolita Davidovich is cast as a Reno cigarette girl who is pursued by both Al Stump and Cobb.  She gives a good performance but I think the main reason she's in the film is to liven it up with a bit of flesh.  There's also a small role played by Roger Clemens, the real-life pitcher in a scene of a baseball game played around 1916. Wisely, the camera doesn't stay too long on Tommy Lee Jones for this scene because he just can't look like a very young man.The screenplay was ambitious but it lacked something.  It was overlong and tended to be boring.  Once the general situation was set, there was just one kind of outrageous behavior after another to prove the point that Cobb was difficult and that Stump was starting to admire the old man.  In my opinion, the whole film could have been condensed to a one-hour television movie.  As I'm interested in baseball, I did enjoy the film.  But it certainly isn't one that I can highly recommend.",Cobb VHS

220068,"In the early 1960s, celebrated director Peter Bogdanovich (1971's THE LAST PICTURE SHOW; 1972's WHAT'S UP, DOC?; 1973's PAPER MOON, et al.) was just starting his career in the motion-picture industry as an interviewer and critic.  By the middle of the decade, he was working as a technical assistant for renowned low-budget producer/director Roger Corman, with whom he developed a good working relationship and a great mutual respect.Impressed with Bogdanovich's creative and aesthetic contributions to the projects of others on his staff, Corman offered him the opportunity to write and direct a horror cheapie of his own, and of course, Bogdanovich jumped at the chance.  But this would be a true test of Bogdanovich's mettle, Corman warned, because there would be three restrictions placed upon the project: Bogdanovich must keep the cost of making the film within its meager budget; the film must make prudent use of footage edited out of Corman's earlier cheapie, THE TERROR; and the film must feature actor Boris Karloff (yes, THE Boris Karloff, who was contractually indebted to Corman's production studio for one last film).  The result?  TARGETS, Bogdanovich's suspensful and intriguing two-pronged study of the effects of unrelenting ennui.In the film, Karloff portrays Byron Orlok, an aged horror star of yesteryear who, despite opposition from his assistant and a director friend, wants to retire from filmmaking.  The world has become so apathetic towards violence, he believes, that everyday events can sometimes be scarier than any of his fright flicks, and thereby his work has become pass&eacute;.Tim O'Kelly plays a dissatisfied young husband whose lack of genuine success is making it difficult for him to live in the shadow of his overbearing father. When he finally reaches his breaking point, he stoically murders his wife and parents, after which he takes his father's rifles and goes on a sniping spree.The two stories converge at a drive-in theater, where Byron Orlok is preparing to make a public appearance (and where he plans to deliver his swan song and announce his retirement to his  fans).  After shooting at passing cars on a nearby highway, the sniper hightails it to the drive-in, being drawn there when he notices Orlok's name on the marquee.  When the two men actually meet, the ennui in the lives of each finally comes to a head, but with quite different consequences.The performance that Karloff delivered in TARGETS is arguably one of the best of his career.  But it wasn't much of a stretch for him, to be honest, as the film was shot just a few years before his death and he was, therefore, merely playing himself.  Peter Bogdanovich not only directed the film, he also played Sammy Michaels, the director friend of Orlok who is trying to talk the actor out of retiring.  A beautiful young asian woman named Nancy Hsueh played Orlok's personal assistant, and she did an excellent job of complementing both Karloff and Bogdanovich.  (Her performance really is outstanding, especially considering that she plays a secondary character, and it's a shame that she didn't go on to greater recognition before her death in 1981.)Tim O'Kelly also derserves some kudos for the work he did as the discontented sniper.  The role required little dialogue, so O'Kelly had to express most of his feelings and thoughts through facial expressions.  It is really amazing to see the dichotomy of emotion--sometimes a mix of boredom and desperation, sometimes both anger and sadness--that he was able to convey at any given moment.By the way, Bogdanovich did comply, for the most part, with Corman's requisites. Though production did go a bit over budget, TARGETS was still a low-budget film, even by the standards of the 1960s.  (Since it was both critically acclaimed and a commercial success, the film actually earned a moderate profit for Corman's studio.)  And obviously Karloff was, as required, the star of the film.  But what of those snippets of footage from THE TERROR that Bogdanovich had to add in?  They were were used as the &quot;movie&quot; that plays at the drive-in just before the Orlok character is scheduled to address his fans.  Clever, eh?Priase to Paramount for finally releasing TARGETS on DVD; the long-awaited disc is just fantastic!  Though it doesn't appear as if much, if any, restoration was done, the print that was used for the transfer seems to be in very good shape.  Colors are crisp and vibrant, and there are few intrusive wear artifacts.  There are few extras, but an interesting feature commentary with director and co-star Bogdanovich is included.  And at the going retail price, this DVD is a steal!  Not often is such an excellent gem offered at for so little, especially one that has gained as big a cult following as this film has over the years.This is certainly one film that is a must-own for Karloff fans.  And those who love well-made, suspenseful thriller will be remiss if they don't add TARGETS to their collection.",Targets VHS
297462,"Believe the hype. The film is a masterpiece. Period. And one movie everyone must experience.I'll comment instead on the extras, particularly Roger Ebert's incredibly informative and engaging commentary. He loves movies, loves &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and it shows. He loads it with anecdotes, educational information, and not a few spoilers on the special effects and goofs. Ebert presents what amounts to an excellent Citizen Kane 101 lecture where the film, and not the lecturer, takes center stage. Nice job.Unfortunatley, Peter Bogdanovich's commentary is sub-par. When he's not name-dropping (&quot;When I met Orson... I asked Orson&quot; blah blah), he suffers from the annoying tendency to recount what's on the screen.And the rest of the extras are excellent too. Great DVD transfer.",N/A

I'd even go so far to say that for the most part, Ford was acting so well I began to hate his character...which of course is his intent. That's saying a lot since I have a hard time buying him as a bad guy (What Lies Beneath was just abysmal). There is, of course, the hullabaloo about the accents. Are they bad? Yes. Ford's is at times too underdone, and at times way over the top. Neeson's is basically absent, and we get more Irish dialect than anything else. I get the feeling they needed a better voice coach...if they even used one. BUT! I found myself getting over it all after about fifteen minutes and following the story instead. It starts slow, but if you hang in there for about a half hour, the tension surfaces, and once it does it rarely lets up. There's genuine emotion and struggle when the reactor springs it leak, and the crew must enter the radiation filled room to fix it. It's just plain depressing and disturbing, and I completely identified wth the blistering men who suffered the effects. I bought Ford's concern over his crew while at the same time struggling with his allegiance to his homeland. I bought Neeson's love for his crew and disgust with Ford's reckless ways.  I routed for the men to escape...Russian men at that, who chose to moon the American Destoryer that was offering them assistance.  Naturally, there are some stretches that make you yawn, and there are some moments where you'll question the  truth of this supposedly True Story. The only major thing that annoyed me was the Hollywood-ized ending. It was unecessary and boring.",N/A

He falls for a girl who is the picture of a Boheimian(Claire Danes) and is ultamately left hartbroken when she leaves him for his older, better looking, but remarkably colder older brother(Ryan Phillippe).  This is a bare summary that sets the story, but shows you none of the profound truth and emotion that the film portreys.  Kieren Culkin is Igby, but he could easily be a young Robert Downey Jr.  You truely get a first glimps of an astonishing young actor.Igby is not his real name but it is so fitting for such an original character.  Igby Goes Down is full of sophistocated and complex characters.  But they are all manage to be very different.  Films released recently that claim to draw an accurate portrate of the youth experience in today's society such as The Rules Of Attraction, are full of the same characters appearing in both sexes and all sexualities.  It is rare that a film can make characters relationships seem real if the characters are not similar.  Igby is the exception.  The film repeats no characters and all relationships seem realer for it.  The longest friendships in real life are not based on common interests, interests change.  Real relationships are built on differences.  For example the reason you fight so much with your mother is because you are so alike.  This is true of Igby's relationship with his mother, and the differences between himself and the others around him is what keeps the film and the relationships interesting.No one should miss this truely brilliant, amazing, funny, and charming movie.",Igby Goes Down
735067,"Because of the way the parts of the '.hack' package are being released, I am not sure if this is a series of episodes based on video games, or vice versa.  A rather ingenious marketing ploy will probably have many of us buying '.hack' releases for some time to come.  Fortunately, from what I have seen the producers have spared little expense in creating a quality product.  Therefore, other than the amount we will be out of pocket, there is very little to complain about.The episodes start out with the appearance of Tsukasa, a wave master (whatever that is) in the virtual game universe called 'The World.'  Tsukasa is different from ordinary players.  He remembers little of the past, seems unbound by The World's game rules, has a monster as a defense system, and is haunted by a cat figure that the powers to be consider an illegal avatar.  It is the last that puts him at odds with Lady Subaru and the Crimson Knights (player/sysops), and for that matter with almost everyone else.  Oh, lest I forget,  Tsukasa cannot log off.There is a wide breadth of characters, from nasties like BT and Sora, to more sympathetic player.  In the latter camp the two most interesting are Bear, a shamanic figure and Mimiru, a swordswoman who develops an interest in Tsukasa.  Our hero is an ambivalent character, possessing a bit too much attitude for his own good.  Especially when he is attracting attention as a source of trouble and mystery.  Rumor has it that a special item hidden in the game world has been discovered, and many think that the wave master has it.As a production, '.hack' is beautiful.  The designers have created a genuinely lovely dungeons and dragons world.  And than peopled it with the interesting and attractive characters created by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, spooky monsters, and the usual assortment of lovable geeks.  Music by Yuki Kajiura is equal to the setting, making this the beginning of a story that promises to fascinate and delight repeatedly.  A winner for sure.

260123,"Okay, firstly, this isn't the greatest movie, not really. I myself was a 16 year old headbanger when this movie came out, so, identifying as I did with our misunderstood heavy metal protagonist, I loved it. And I guess that what's gotten to me this time around, prompting me to get the notably inexpensive DVD. Haven't seen this movie since high school, many moons ago. The one thing I never understood was the soundtrack by Fastway. The movie's villain, Sammi Curr, was supposed to be the blasphemous lord and master of hard core black metal, but like, he was just singing Fastway songs. Fastway was hard rock at best, and an especially harmless hard rock band at that.The hero, Skippy from Family Ties, is crushed when his hero Sammi Curr dies in a hotel fire. But his dj buddy, Gene Simmons (in his five minute cameo) gives him the one and only copy of Curr's final unreleased album. Skippy learns that if he plays the record backwards, he can conjur his dead hero in ghostly/electric form. (The movie started off reciting lines about Faust, so we can only assume that Curr, by association, made some pact with the devil.) Anyway, at first Curr helps Skippy settle some old scores with the sissy-mary schoolhouse bullies that never give him a moment's rest. But then things begin going a little too far, and Skippy tries to pull the plug---especially after Curr threatens Skippy's highschool dream girl. Curr later shows up at the school Halloween dance, and starts trimming down the student body, singing, stage-cavorting, and shooting blue lightning bolts out of his guitar. Skippy, to save his girl, is forced to fight with his hero. actually, for what it was, the movie was entertaining, and did have some clever parts, but I think mostly people around my age group would appreciate it.For me, it was strange seeing it again. I remember, as a kid, having a slight crush on Skippy's girlfriend. I remembered her being kinda hot, but my memories from those days are a little addled from excessive doses of, uh...teenage fun. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she was the same beautiful girl I remembered. It's good to know that at least a few things stay the same. Ozzy is plastered on the cover, but, unfortunately, he was only in the movie for about two minutes, playing a televangelist speaking out against heavy metal. I think that was Ozzy from about the time of his No Rest for the Wicked days. Still, it's Ozzy, so it's cool.",Trick Or Treat VHS
618381,"It must be one of the outstanding romantic comedies of 2003.  This is another masterpiece by the author of the most celebrated British comedies (4 Weddings, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones).The movie is driven by as many as 6 different stories going on simultaneously, switching from one into the next.  The viewer is left with anticipation of all the other stories while he enjoys the current story being told; it is one of those movies that leaves us waiting at the end for a little more.Another highlight of the movie is the cast; there are many stars, each of which figure in one of the little plots.  Some of it converges in the end, but the main theme of love is present throughout.  The stories range from a lovesick prime minister (Hugh Grant), to an angry cheated wife (Emma Thompson), to an English writer with a Portuguese maid with whom he cannot communicate.If you liked the other british comedies mentioned, you will love this one.  If you dislike happy endings, stir away from this movie; I have never seen this many.",Love Actually

A bank robbery gone wrong, who was the police mole?When I first saw it I was amazed at how it lived up to its huge reputation. Harvey Kietal reminded me of why nowadays he is one of fave actors and I had never thought it would be more enjoyable than Tarantinos other top film - &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.If you enjoy action thrillers then this will be a treat.

608012,"MICHAEL Caine is the world weary journalist in French Indochina during the violent Vietminh communist insurgency against colonial rule in 1951-52. Graham Greene who wrote the book of the film was himself an Intelligence Officer for the British SIS, among other things. The attention to detail in the plot and the authenticity shows true to life precisely because of this. The book was Graham Greene's biography of sorts. He liked to cavort with nubile young women too. The movie was filmed on location in Vietnam and also in the Caravelle Hotel that I love, especially the Saigon-Saigon Bar on the rooftop.Michael is infatuated with a young, pretty, anaemic, somewhat brainless Vietnamese 'fille de joie' in Saigon. She is young enough to be his granddaughter and he has a Roman Catholic wife in London who won't divorce him. Obviously, he likes to live on the edge.Enter Alden Pyle, the quiet American. Is he all that he seems? Obviously not, he is on semi-official cover as an Medical AID worker. He falls for Phoung the Viet bimbo and fireworks begin. The eternal triangle all over again. Two men in love with one woman. Something has got to give or perhaps they might form a menage a trois??? Pyle saves Caine's life knowing that General The, the leader of the Third Force means to TWEP Fowler (Caine), but is he grateful? No way , baby, he betrays Pyle and just by standng at a window holding a black book, he gives the KILL order to the Vietminh communist cell. And get this, who is the leader of the communist Vietminh cell unit? None other than Caine's trusty right hand man and gopher. Never trust a subservient Oriental like him as he might just stab you in the back, literally. However, Caine's assistant and his motley crew of Vietminh terrorists corner Pyle in a dark, back alley and that's the end of Pyle. Knifed in the guts. Looks like he passed bottom of his class in hand to hand combat at The Farm. Caine even sets up Pyle by luring him to a dinner at the Vieux Moulin but the table is set for one. What an evil creepo. Fowler is as guilty as the Vietminh commie killers. The French Police Officer knows but has insufficient evidence. When questioned, Fowler says, ""There's a war on. People are dying all the time...""Pyle dies horribly, but what the hell? He was a Company man and he did his job, for Freedom and the American dream. That was his job...to prowl the dark alleys of the world doing things no one else wanted to do or had the guts to do, for Freedom and Liberty. And so the Greek tragedy ends with Caine and Phoung. Will they end happily? I think not, what goes around comes around. They'll get their just desserts, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of their unhappy lives.

269238,"Most of us probably think of George C. Scott and think ""Patton.""  In this movie he plays a character about as far removed from General George as you can get.  Mordecai Jones is a con artist with a mission: to teach people (by ""flim-flamming"" them) not to give in to ""greed and fourteen-karat ignorance.""  Jason ""Curly"" Treadaway, a farmboy who has deserted the Army after breaking the jaw of a mouthy Yankee sergeant, comes to his aid when he's thrown off a train.  Since both are broke, Mordecai suggests that Curly shill for him long enough to accumulate a small stake.  From this springs a partnership in which Curly, to his dismay, discovers he has a real gift for dishonest dealings.  Tormented by conscience and shattered illusions, he still originates a plan to escape when the pair are finally run down and arrested--and then comes up with an even more audacious one to get Jones out, because, as he tells the girl he's fallen in love with, ""he's my *partner*, and that means somethin'.""This movie lacks the slapstick that often characterizes comedy; there's a wild car chase (Jones and Curly in a convertible Mordecai has ""borrowed,"" pursued by the local sheriff, turning their chariot into a ""ramblin' wreck"" and destroying a considerable portion of the town of Clayton in the process), but most of the film concentrates on Mordecai's schemes--everything from three-card monte and punchboards through the Pigeon Drop to an elaborate masquerade in which he manages to swap a truckload of moonshine for a mound of assorted merchandise.  The supporting cast is especially good, with Harry Morgan shining as Sheriff Slade and Albert Salmi delightful as his young chief deputy, Meshaw.  And while not for the morally ambivalent, it manages to bring up some important ethical issues.  As Mordecai tells Curly, ""You can't cheat a honest man!""  With no sex or profanity to speak of, it could well serve as the launching point for some telling discussions with your kids about right and wrong, loyalty, and what honesty really is.",The Flim Flam Man VHS
769248,"This movie was amazing.  It had a very positive effect on me.  I just finished watching it not even 5 minutes ago.  I wanted to write this review before the effect the movie had on me, faded away.  This film made me realize certain things.  One of those things is that I myself, have strayed from Jesus a bit.  I stopped going to church 14 or 15 years ago and I used to say prayers at night before falling asleep.  I haven't done that in many, many years.  I still believe in Jesus strongly, but I don't think about him and what he has done for us, nearly as much as I used to.  This movie is very good.  It's not just for extremely religious people, but for anyone.  The speech that Dr. Russell Carlisle gives at the Church, right near the end of the movie, could almost bring a tear to your eye.  It was a very moving speech and as you are listening to it you keep saying to yourself that everything he is preaching to the people is absolutely true.  Society is moving further and further away from the teachings of Jesus.  We have become more rude and more cruel towards one another.  We are more self-centered than we ever were before.  In this film they quote the divorce rate in 1890 as being 5% and they were shocked by that back then.  Then in the year 2000 the divorce rate is quoted again at being 50%.  Earlier this year (2003) the United States had a divorce rate of 57%.  That is the highest that it has ever been in history.  We were also tied with another country, for having the highest divorce rate of any nation on Earth.  What has happened to our society ?

773039,"First, let me tell you that, being a Clapton fan I try to get hold of everything he releases, whether official or not, and of my modest collection, this is, along with the Hyde Park concert of 1996, one of the best performances caught on video.As part of the small tour of 1986 he did, this England unique date of a 2-day leg, features Phil Collins on drums, Greg Phillinganes on Keyboards and bassist extraordinaire Nathan East. The tight sound is amazing and as other reviewer mentioned, for a 4 piece, the sound is great, like a steam roller downhill!As for the Dvd release, this concert had been out in VHS form and now the DVD makes justice to the sound with DTS and 5.1 features. Video quality does not improve much upon the original tape, but I guess just there's so much you can do with a 1986 videotape. As far as extras, this release has none but the simples menu and intro animation with a small 3D guitar spinning around.I love this concert so much I'd like to see a few more tracks, or some commetary by one of the performers. Anyway, it is a great document in Clapton's career and &quot;comeback&quot; of the mid 80's. Recommended!",N/A
690267,"Poor Edward G. Robinson.  That is to say, poor Christopher Cross, the character Robinson plays in SCARLET STREET (presumably no relation to the 80's pop ""star"" of the same name, although that would explain a lot).  Chris is trapped in a loveless marriage to a woman who looks like Edith Bunker and acts like Archie.  He's a middle-aged bank-cashier who has gone through life having never truly been loved nor having loved anyone himself.  The one enjoyable thing he has in his life is his art, his paintings - which his totalitarian wife has banished to the bathroom, as she hates the smell of his paints.  So, when this poor, downtrodden, lonely man happens upon a young and beautiful woman, it's easy to see how he could be utterly manipulated by her.At first, I thought I was going to be bored by this film.  It takes its time setting up the scenario and the various characters.  But once the plot gets cooking, I was completely engrossed.  I love a film that surprises me, and I simply could not guess where this story was going.  As one nears the end, surprise revelations and unexpected bombshells come exploding out like fireworks.  And every revelation was logical and consistent, but startling.  I made several mental predictions, and after I started getting all of them wrong, I just sat back and let the film overtake me.Fritz Lang's direction makes this a darker film than even the screenplay probably anticipated.  There are several scenes that are still unsettling today.  The more experimental sequences near the end are quite haunting.  It's certainly not a feel-good movie; the only characters that aren't out and out despicable are merely pathetic.  I won't give away the ending, but it's enough to say that there is no ""...and they all lived happily ever after"".  People get what they deserve, and in SCARLET STREET, they deserve a hell of a lot of it.The acting is quite good across the board, with a few notables.  Edward G. Robinson is, of course, great.  If that man ever gave a poor performance, then I have yet to see it.  Here, he is playing against type -- an apron-wearing, totally dominated, shell of a man.  He conveys a genuinely sad loneliness by his mere expressions as his confidence crumbles at every indignity and the way he desolately clings to any scrap of love he can find.  You'd completely forget this was the man who played tough gangster Johnny Rocco in KEY LARGO.  Dan Duryea is possibly laying it on a little thick as the sleazy, scheming boyfriend, but that sort of thing is what the role calls for.  Joan Bennett rounds out the cast as Kitty March, the woman who lets Cross fall in love with her, and then takes him for as much cash as she can.The DVD released by Alpha Video has some flaws.  However, since it is the only one on the market at the moment, we're stuck with it.  The picture is decent, but not what I would call great.  There are a numerous scratches and the image is a little fuzzy.  On one or two occasions, the movie skips a few seconds ahead.  The sound quality I would describe as adequate, but muffled.  A few times, I had to rewind because I couldn't hear what the actors were saying.  It's not a wholly awful disc, but I wouldn't get your hopes up as to its overall quality.  Perhaps a better print of this film will show up on DVD; until then, we'll have this.  And this is quite a cheap disc, so it does have that advantage.",N/A

I rated this five stars because of Crispin Glover's brilliant portrayal of Willard. Mr Glover's acting and facial expression puts the audience in the proper frame of mind for a horror movie.  In the beginning, he brilliantly shows the emotion of a person who feels that everyone is putting him down. Little by little his mood changes to that of one determined to get revenge. The special effects of the rats throughout the picture was excellent. In addition to the rats scaring you, Willard's mother's physical appearance is somewhat frightening. There are various photgraphs of Willard's father shown throughout the picture.  To those who are observant, the man in the photos is Bruce Davison who portrayed Willard in the original movie.",N/A
617947,"Kill Bill was great. It was better than Pulp Fiction. I don't know why I liked it so much but it was just really exciting and funny and nicely edited. The gore was extreme and some of the blood was cartoonish and the action was a little tongue-and-cheeck but the sword fighting scenes were the best sword fighting scenes that I've ever seen.Kill Bill is so incredibly unique because it's the first action movie I've ever seen that were a combination of so many other genres. It was like a huge tribute to comic books, Anime, westerns, explotation films, Psychedelic films and Kung-Fu flicks. The characters and the dialogue were entertaining and the music was also good. It fit so well with the picture!Uma Thurman was really great in her performance. She's like a female Johnny Depp in the way that she becomes characters with such ease. She really improved a already great film. My only complaint is Bill. They have that weird guy from that lame Kung-Fu series. The only person as weird or as creepy as him is Christopher Lambert. Thank goodness he wasn't in the flick. If you love Pulp Fiction and Quentin's films then you will like this one. It's a lot of fun. It, however, is not for the faint of heart.

681664,"Due to an overpresence of saccharine to non-existent scripting and plots, I tend to shy away from Disney's live action offerings. Even though they supposedly market to all ages, I never saw anything memorable...until this release.Familiarity with former Representative Ronald V. Dellums (D CA)'s politics convinced me to give this dramatization a chance. Even if it employed some of the traditional scripting elements I despised in many youth videos, I would also be able to see anti-apartheid work of some kind.The story centers around the learning experience his daughter Piper and a white South African exchange student named Mahree have when they (especially the lattter, who has to learn blacks are not placed on the earth to serve her) meet and learn each other are more alike and dissimillar.Also inspiring is Mahree's implicit promise to take up anti-apartheid work upon returning to South Africa, given the likely loss of her own privlleged position this would entail. As an anti-racist white, I did not intially like the self-centered behavior exhibited by the earlier Mahree and found her change of conciousness much more enjoyable.While this film (like many of Disney's offerings) is geared towards youth, I have personally watched this film several times and can readily attest anybody regardless of age will enjoy this video.",The Color of Friendship VHS

Unfortunately, the same magic is not evident when transferred onto the large theater screen. Atkinson does not suffice in the lead role of Johnny English. This James Bond spoof fails every time John Malkovich is not included in a scene. The latter actor portraying the laughably sinister French businessman, Pascal Sauvage, who wants to become King of England is hysterical and provides the right type of balance for this role. Natalie Imbruglia does a serviceable job as Lorna Campbell, the love interest of our not too bright secret agent.The scatological jokes were over the top and I personally could have done without these yucky attempts at humor. Also, Johnny English is far too slow paced and is about eight minutes too long. I can only give this film three stars. You might wish to wait until it is released in dvd format.",Johnny English
737294,"""Endgame"" is an interestingly ambiguous story of how a kept London rent-boy seeks safety when his sugar daddy comes to a deserved bad end.  Tom (played by Daniel Newman) is kept up in an opulent London apartment by wealthy George Norris (played by Mark McGann).  While his family unsuspectingly lives the good life in Surrey, George deals drugs and blackmails in London, supported by a crooked detective, Frank Dunston (played by John Benfield).  George and Frank inflict rough sex on Tom as rent, as well as create blackmail videotapes from Tom's tricking.  One day Tom resists, and George ends up dead.  Knowing that the police will be unsympathetic, Tom seeks help from some recent acquaintances, a neighboring couple from America (Max and Nikki Bergman, played by Corey Johnson and Toni Barry, respectively), who have just purchased a cottage in Wales.  When Tom convinces the couple to help him flee, the three drive to the cottage.  Crooked Frank has ways of finding things out, and the film moves to its climax.Although there was a variety of accents, attentive listeners should understand almost everything.  The outdoor scenes in Gwynedd (north-west Wales) were very beautiful (and didn't need commentary or orchestral swell to make the point).  There were many skin shots, mainly of Tom, a hottie.  The acting was good, especially by the bad guys.  Be warned that there is considerable violence shown in scenes of collecting money, interrogation, and in some sex scenes.  One interrogation scene involving a car and a barber chair is far-fetched but riveting.  The direction keeps the movie flowing at a brisk pace.The movie is ambiguous on a number of issues.  Was George's death really an accident?  Why were Max and Nikki so accommodating?  What was the real dynamic between Tom and Nikki?  Did Tom end up where he belonged?  There is a plot hole or two as well.  Viewers will interpret as they wish.The extras were the trailer to ""Endgame"" and to three other films.  There was no director's commentary, making-of, behind-the-scenes, photo gallery,  deleted scenes, or written list of chapter names.""Endgame"" gives the viewer a good look at a kept boy who fell in with a very wrong crowd and needs a change.  One can detect behind his coping defenses that he is cleverer than average.",N/A
506204,"This is the third Tenchi movie and the second one in the ""Tenchi Universe"" continuity.  The movie starts out as a standard Tenchi fare with Ayeka and Ryoko fighting over a broom.  They rush to Tenchi to resolve the dispute which he is loathe to do.  Finally, Ayeka has had enough and demands Tenchi choose between herself and Ryoko -- which girl does he want to be with?  Tenchi doesn't want to hurt either girl so he distracts them and runs off into the woods where he disappears into a tree.Six months later, Tenchi is still missing and everyone is searching.  Sasami returns to Jurai to use their network.  Washu uses her vast scientific knowledge and resources, enlisting Kiyone and Mihoshi to assist her.  Finally, Ryoko and Ayeka put aside their differences and head to Tokyo where Washu has determined Tenchi to be.While this starts as a standard Tenchi fare, this quickly turns into a serious tale of maturity, love, and loss.  People who enjoyed the various Tenchi sagas for their humor may be put off by this movie.  However, if you can accept this as a serious story, it is a very good one.  Watching all of the girls in the Masaki household putting everything aside for Tenchi is very touching, especially when it comes to Ayeka and Ryoko working well together.As I mention in my title, Tenchi does choose between the girls, but not in a way that some might expect. Personally, I think Tenchi made his choice in the ""Tenchi Universe"" series.  As we are shown Tenchi's new life where he can't remember his past, one girl continues to come to his mind.  He draws her and paints her though he doesn't remember her.  As to the girls, one conceeds defeat in order to save Tenchi while the other takes one more chance to rescue Tenchi despite the danger not to mention apparently being rejected earlier.Bottom line:  As a story, this one is truely a good one.  The standard complaints against Pioneer's subtitles (translations & readability) still stand and the extras are nothing to write home about.  Fans of good romantic stories will enjoy this as will most Tenchi fans.  Anime fans should also appreciate this title.",Tenchi Forever VHS
594899,"I'm not averse to directors' taking film genres that we are all familiar with and doing new things with them. That is what M. Night Shyamalan is apparently trying to do in Signs, taking the classical alien invasion film and focussing on how one particular family copes with everybody's worst nightmare. It's an interesting idea, and it worked really well for about the first half of the film. Up until that point, we still do not know what or who is leaving those mysterious crop circles. This creates an almost unbearable atmosphere of suspense, which is heightened by Shyamalan's technical skills as a filmmaker. I nearly jumped out of my seat a few times in the scenes in which Mel Gibson's character is walking through his cornfield at night, including one scene in which he catches a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye. This is the kind of stuff that I was expecting when I paid for my ticket. But then the film gets all messy. First we have an appearance by Shyamalan himself that is absolutely mystifying and seemingly unrelated to the whole plot. In another scene, Gibson's family watches recorded footage on television of an alien walking past terrified schoolchildren in Brazil. The scene is admittedly creepy to say the least, but it has the unsavory consequence of removing most of the suspense from the film. Now we know exactly who is leaving the crop circles; it doesn't really help that Shyamalan's aliens are incredibly unoriginal, indeed like something out of the original Star Trek series. After that, things kind of fall apart. This becomes especially acute when Shyamalan injects his typical spiritual conundrum into the plot, as we learn that Mel Gibson's character is a former priest who lost his faith after his wife was killed in a traffic accident. And unsurprisingly, after we learn this, much of the rest of the film revolves around Gibson regaining his faith in time to save his family. Just exactly what the connection is between Gibson's born again status and his family's survival is uncertain in the film, but the implication is that the former led to the latter. But ignoring the unsuitability of adding this dimension to the plot, the whole logic of Gibson's transformation is even stranger. Remember, his wife's death made him lose his faith; this is obviously a horrible tragedy for anyone to deal with, maybe the worst, but as a Christian Gibson's character would logically be consoled with the knowledge that his wife is in a better place and that he will see her again someday. Now, an alien invasion occurs. Rather than intensifying Gibson's disbelief, as his wife's death did, this unimaginable occurrence causes him to regain his faith. Wow! Maybe I'm being too picky, though. More unforgiveable is Shyamalan's attitude toward the whole plot. He seems to presume that his deep spirituality absolves him from having to come up with an interesting plot resolution. That is the only explanation that I can think of for the ending. It is simply too unconvincing and indeed absurd to be taken seriously. I won't say anymore on that. For me, the half-dozen or so terrifying scenes in the first half of the movie did not make up for the disappointing finale. I was not frightened once in the last hour, only irritated. I'm through with Shyamalan.",Signs

It's a mystical tale which brilliantly and simply explains the origins of the immortality of Santa Claus and many of his associated traditions of Christmas. Although it's a bit off the beaten path of holiday classics, The Life and Adventures of Santa Clause captures the essence of some universal themes such as the struggles between good &amp; evil and the nature of humanity.

Little Shop Around the Corner and To Be or Not TO Be are both frequent fliers on TNT, and feature exquisite performances by some of the era's best loved stars, ie. Stewart, Lombard and Benny.  A director would have to be proud of having either one of them designated as his crowning achievement.While Trouble in Paradise is graced by two wonderful supporting actors, the squabbling Edward Everett Horton and Charlie Ruggles, the leads for this film are not exactly household names.  (I always associate Kay Francis with with sublime chaos of the Marx Brothers first stab at the talkies.)  That the three leads manage such effervescence is a strong indication of the talent of the director.  They manage to suavely seduce the audience just as they entice one another on screen.This is a superb adult comedy, and not a bad date movie at that. Just how historically great or influential it is may be best left to the critics, but just standing on its own, it's undeniably one hell of an elegant piece of entertainment,",Trouble in Paradise
596269,"Set in 2054, ""Minority Report"" follows the exploits of a cop and his pre-cogs - his what?!?  Three humans with exceptional clarvoyance and telepathic abilities predict crimes before they occur.  The system is flawless.  That is, until Tom Cruise finds himself being predicted as the next killer of a man that he has never met.  There's a lot of set up to this story that really drags, not the least of which is an extended chase on a vertical highway that is so CGI driven it is impossible to take seriously and a greenhouse segment that is full of lethal plants and a long explicative scene between the women who invented pre-crime and Cruise, who is nearly poisoned to death. In between we have some chase sequences that are not very engaging and a few gross-out scenes that really turn one's stomach, including one where Cruise, who has just had his eyes plucked from his head, eats a really spoiled sandwich by mistake and up-chucks a few seconds later.  I'm not sure what Spielberg was thinking when he made this movie.  It's dark, in a sort of ""Blade Runner"" way but with a bleached out color scheme that is not very engaging or easy on the eyes.  In fact it's down right oppressive.  Just in case you were too stupid to grasp the general concept of the film (which I must admit, for the first 30 min. I was) there's a long explanation at the end of the film in which dialogue between Cruise and the killer tie everything up nicely - too nicely and too neatly for a film that teeters between action/adventure and film noir.  Unfortunately, in this reviewers opinion, the ultimate product is neither but a mutt - a mix of a little of this and that, that comes off as nothing special in the final analysis.As for the DVD transfer - Dreamworks has retained the grain of the original theatrical experience but somehow managed to make the film look so grainy that, not even in theaters, do I remember it being this unpleasant a viewing experience on the eyes.  Quite literally, if you're watching this film on an anmorphic big screen at home, some of the scenes will make you sick.  The audio is nicely represented.  As a two disc special edition, disc two has a truck load of extras that are rather boring to watch.  Cruise looks and talks as if he's just finished an all night B-movie marathon while Spielberg somehow manages to retain none of that magic spark that made him become a director in the first place.

Basically a retelling of the monster in the woods tale, the success of the book is in the complex and textured interweaving of five friends, all linked, all with extraordinary gifts. One is extraordinary; although the weakest in body and mind, he is the strongest in spirit. The movie misses all of this, and butcher's the ending. This is among King's masterworks, and the movie does it little justice. Morgan Freeman, usually a strong enough force to carry a script on his own shoulders, is wooden and stereotypic. It might take you longer, but I recommend that you spend a couple of days reading the book than trying to make sense of this hacked up and bland rendering.",N/A
184527,"Two intelligent but mean-minded and resentful young women, who have been made that way by a lifetime of emotional deprivation, meet in this small village where Sophie (Sandrine Bonnaire) has come to apply for a job as a housekeeper to a prosperous middle-class family. They are both alone in the world, and to each other they display a genuine warmth and affection that is terribly at odds with their attitude towards everyone else. And it doesn't help that the family that Sophie goes to work for has everything; both material wealth and a happy, contented family life. The contrast between their lot and Sophie's couldn't be greater. And the fact that they are such close-knit happy family makes the denouement so much more painful to watch. They reach out to sophie and try to make her feel  as much at home and part of the family as possible. But she can't stop feeling envious, nor get over her sense of  injustice; why should they have so much when she has nothing? And her sense of injustice is aggravated by a secret shame;  she cannot read or write.In the beginning the family are well  pleased with her work; she is conscientious and hard working. But this is eventually undermined by the bad influence of her friend Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert), and the fact that she keeps disappearing to meet Jeanne - who the husband hates because, at the post office where she works, she keeps opening his mail.And then she begins smuggling Jeanne into the house to watch television, something which, when he finds out, angers the husband. But the final straw comes when she tries to blackmail  the daughter into not telling her parents about her inability to read or write. This leads to her instant dismissal which enrages Jeanne. They want vengeance, but what they eventually do seems a spur of  the moment thing.You feel deeply sad about what happens to this charming family and almost as sad about what happens to Sophie and Jeanne. The overriding feeling at the end of the film is a sense of loss.If the two girls had never met they would have continued to be bitter and resentful but it would  have ended there. It was their coming together which enlarged and reinforced their feelings and gave them the  confidence to act - with awful consequences for both themselves and the family. They were victims of a kind of mob-mentality.",N/A
374880,"Linda Fiorentino gives the performance of her career in ""The Last Seduction"" playing Bridget Gregory, who is the most ruthless, callous, mean, greedy and fascinating woman possibly ever seen on screen. In the beginning of the film, Bridget gets her doctor husband (Bill Pullman) to make a pharmaceautical drug deal for almost a million dollars, after which she takes off with the cash leaving her husband pennilness. Then she temporarily locates to a small town, where she begins to manipulate a pathetic smalltown buffoon (Peter Berg, who she also treats as a human vibrator) into killing her husband. Linda Fiorentino is just such a blast playing Bridget that instead of hating her, you root for her. As rotten to the core as she is, you cheer as she constantly manipulates and destroys the hapless men around her, and emerges victorious.

The Tick stands alone atop the putrid hill of evil delivering a double-barreled dose of justice into the fowl soil that reeks with bad-doing.Why this show was cancelled is beyond me, much like `The Greatest American Hero', The Tick lives on in the thoughts and hearts of many a down trodden citizen. Bringing an animated superhero to life is no easy task, but Patrick Warburton had The Tick down cold. The antennae were a perfect match right along with the cartoon. I would have preferred a full faced mask with a giant rubber chin, but the rest of the costume was cool. Arthur (Burke) was also a good match, the moth costume was great.My only question was the other characters. Why were Deflator  Mouse and American Maid changed to Bat Manuel and Lady Liberty? Maybe it was a copyright issue or something. Both played their parts well, but Deflator Mouse was a little more arrogant and bumbling in the cartoon (this character could have been played perfectly by Adam West). And American Maid was a tougher character that would kick your butt as easy as looking at you. And what happened to Sewer Urchin? I can only hope that maybe he was planned for the second season, but alas we'll never know.The episodes on this DVD are great. Not for your straight laced stick in the mud viewers, but for folks who love entertainment like The Three Stooges. See The Tick get his Superhero license (I.P. Daily) and watch as they fight the greatest (and oldest) super villain The Terror!Of course The Tick wouldn't be The Tick without his rambling idiocy that makes no sense unless you are on your tenth beer.

De Palma makes complete use of depth within the frame and his visual style is unmatched by any director working today (Scorsese being the exception) so this film (unlike MI2) holds up and is still interesting &amp; riveting after repeated viewings. MI2 is a stupid, cliched plot with lotsa action and explosions I have already seen.

744411,"The Fourth season was far and away the creative peak of DS9 overall. Though the decision to make the Klingons an enemy again was good-intentioned it was utlimately one of the few true storytelling mishaps of the series -- luckily it didn't take a hugely prominent role in the 4th year (the Dominion stepped up to the plate here).  While the third season served as a mostly introductory period to the Dominion, the fourth much more deeply explores this mysterious and terrifying new threat.IN between, some of the best Star Trek episodes ever made are produced -- highlighted by ""The Visitor"", which ranks with ""The Inner Light"" and ""City on the Edge of Forever"" as Trek's most moving episodes ever made.Most of DS9's all-time best episodes are in the 4th YEAR, including...The Way of the Warrior, The Visitor, Rejoined, Little Green Men, Our Man Bashir, Homefront, Paradise Lost, Sons of Mogh, Rules of Engagement, Shattered Mirror, For the Cause, Broken Link.",N/A

She is funny and has a flavor all her own.Santa's 200 year term is almost up and its time to find his replacement. Due to a magical Christmas hat - he finds her in Whoopi.

I wouldn't mind the illogical premise ( anyone who dies is a potential zombie&lt;!?> which over time would transform into a vampire ), as long as it delivers on the action-- but unfortunatly, it exuberates an already silly plot, which in itself is jarring and lacking in direction. The narrative doesn't have the same charming aimlessness of say, Time & Tide, and features truly corny comic moments. The action is standard wire-fu, and it's compentantly done, though there's really nothing that stands out here.

The lead character ---the Indian young woman Jess who loves soccer, Beckham, and then her soccer coach, quickly dispatches clouds of concern with her smile and strength. What she misses, the cheerful, sometimes extra loud, contemporary musical score picks up and kicks to the next movie lot.Some might say the ending is a bit contrived.

724844,"What makes these Stephen King made-for-TV miniseries' so much fun? Could it be the plot, the characters, or the absolute absurdity of them all? Maybe all the above? ""The Shining,"" a 1997 ABC miniseries is no exception, and possibly one of the best King adaptations so far. If a 4 and a half hour movie is watched in one sitting and feels like 2 hours, then it must be good. And ""The Shining"" is definitely good. Steven Webber, Rebecca De Mornay and Courtland Mead are superb in their roles as the Torrance family, an Elliot Gould has a fun cameo as the manager of the Overlook Hotel. A more faithful adaptation of the King novel than the 1980 Kubrick film, I cannot say which is better because they both have their redeeming qualities, and they are both equally fascinating. Steven Webber is no Jack Nicholson, but he gives such a chilling performance. I believed him as Jack Torrance, and frankly, I was freaked out. Weber convincingly humanizes his character, and wonderfully conveys all of the conflicts that are brewing up inside him--his struggle with alcoholism, the desperate need to be a good father since he didn't have one, and his desire to succeed in life despite his father's criticism. De Mornay is perhaps a better Wendy than Shelley Duvall ever was, but Courtland Mead (although good) cannot compare to the performance of Danny Lloyd as the original Danny. I did like many aspects of this version better--the fleshed out characters, delving into the hotel's past (and its haunting), and of course, the hedge animals and wasp nest, which made great additions to the story (I'm sure they were in the book). Of course, the sappy ending to this version doesn't work very well, and the running time becomes a bit tedious toward the end, but overall, the movie is great, all the more due to Webber being so convincingly chilling when he starts to slowly go insane. As far as TV movies go, this is one of the best.",Stephen King's The Shining

717540,"The Lathe of Heaven refers to the dreams of George Orr, a seemingly ordinary young man whose dreams shape the waking reality of the world.  In fact, his dreams change the entire past, present and future history in such a way that only he and his puzzling friend Manny seem to have any memory of an alternate past after he awakens.  Afraid that he may dream some horrible fate upon the world, George turns to drugs for dream suppression --- only to overdose and earn himself court-ordered therapy with appointed psychiatrist Dr. Haber.Haber starts out with the best intentions, but as their dream therapy sessions progress he finds himself believing Orr's fantastic claims, and temptation leads him to manipulate George's dreams for his own advancement.  George soon catches on to what his doctor is doing, confronts him, and sets in motion a race not only for his own freedom but the future of humanity.TLOH works on the level of a psychological thriller rather than action-based science fiction.  A somewhat surrealistic atmosphere underlies every scene, leading us to question whether or not each incarnation of reality after Geoorge wakes may be yet another extension of his dreaming.  The philosophical questions provoked by George's unique situation (Is all reality but a dream? Is Manny even a  real person? Is George the defacto God of his universe?) have an unmistakable existentialist slant.I admit to never having read the novel by Ursula K. LeGuin upon which TLOH is based.  Therefore, I approached this made for cable TV adaptation with no particular expectations.  I thought it was well done for what it was, although by no means could it compete with a high-budget feature film production.  Still, the small cast of main actors were exceptionally well chosen for their roles:  James Caan was comfortable as Dr. Haber and convinced me that he may well have been a psychologist in another life; Lukas Haas was the perfect innocent; Lisa Bonet, while playing the same character type as always, really seemed suited to the role of coolly mysterious attorney/ dream girl Heather LaLache.  In all, the cheerless gray future of @ 30 years from now is realized very plausibly, mainly through set and wardrobe design, with little attempt at ""sci-fi-isms"" such as robot servants or aliens (which I understand made an appearance in the original version).If you can suspend your disbelief and appreciate toned-down, philosophical science fiction, you will be able to enjoy the Lathe of Heaven.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",Lathe Of Heaven
749705,"I was always skeptical about 24 going into a second season. It ended near perfectly at the end of the first season. Buy when I checked out season two, I was hooked all over again. Not only is the season more interesting, it involves issues that our world is currently dealing with. Not only that, but the action has been pumped up 400%, that acting keeps getting better, and Jack (Keifer Sutherland) is one of the best characters to follow on TV.With the finale just around the corner, and a new third season on the way, I think it is safe to say this DVD is a perfect buy for any fan of the show, or anybody who missed its initial run and wants to see what all the hype is about. Surely it will have many more special features than season 1 did, since the first season DVD was produced and created in about 2 months. Most likely as well as the stuff season one's had, like preview for season three, and quite possibly an alernate ending. Hopefully they will put in some commentaries in the mix as well.But anyway.....Fox is doing a great job with their TV on DVD lately.

""Live In Barcelona"" sees Elton somewhere in between, with a new, more mature album out (""The One""), but he is still at his best.With a set of twenty one songs, Elton includes great renditions of, ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"", ""Tiny Dancer "", ""Burn Down the Mission"" and, of course, ""The One"" (it was ""The One"" tour).  Elton John also pays tribute to Queen's Freddie Mercury by singing, ""The Show Must Go On'.  It is the only song in which he gets up from his piano and prances around the stage.  The finale is a beautiful rendition of ""Your Song"" and the instrumental ""Song For Guy"".The sets and clothes were all designed by Gianni Versace and he seems to work without being overbearing.  The camera shots are fairly typical, but the sound is crisp and clear.  There is also a great 50 minute documentary, in which, you meet the entire band, backup singers, tour managers, lighting coordinators and, of course, Gianni Versace.

114027,"Arsenic and Old Lace has a problem.  On the one hand, it is an absolutely an A team effort.  It stars two of the best in Cary Grant and Raymond Massey.  Priscilla Lane as Cary Grant's wife is cute and much put upon.  Then with Frank Capra directing, Max Steiner' music and lush photography by Sol Polito, the result is a very attractive to look at production.On the other hand, no matter how it is dressed up, the story is about a family of serial murderers.  The requirement for a suspension of critical review (the aunts are stone killers; the Raymond Massey character is a murderer and torturer; the Cary Grant character has been a torture victim) is too great for me.  Since none of the killers ever say or do anything that is funny (all those lines belong to other characters) watching this movie becomes an exercise in holding down the gag/revulsion reflex.If I were to look at the stylishness of the production it would rate 4 or 5 stars.  My policy is to try to accept a movie based upon its own premises.  However in this instance, the story is so unremittingly morally bankrupt, that to overlook this lack of principles is to not see the movie before you.

532852,"Although the title is Dungeons and Dragons, the movie retains very little of the game it has derived its name from.  Attempting to make an epic story through the inclusion of the powerful dragons, the plot quickly devolved into nonsense.  The hero of the story, played by Justin Whalen who should have stuck with the Superman television show, is gifted by the fey with a superior sword midway through the film, but continues to lose every sword fight he gets into.  His bumbling sidekick, played comedically by Marlon Wayans, is enjoyable but dies all too soon to suit mood of the movie.  Their pairing makes it difficult to imagine them as the heroes of a film trying to be epic in its storyline.  Aside from the over-the-top acting from Jeremy Irons and the little-used apprentice mage love-interest, none of the other characters makes an impact in the story.  The dwarven and elven companions to the group never even get one swing in during the entire movie, making their inclusion even more preposterous as they become more liability to their scenes than a benefit.The best way to approach this film is to not expect too much, roll with the lack of reasonable plotline, and simply enjoy what it does deliver.  A somewhat humorous spoof of fantasy movies done poorly.",Dungeons & Dragons
596968,"When it comes to pure charisma, the only Hong Kong actor who matches with Jackie Chan is Chow Yun-Fat (who is, overall, probably a better actor). What is it about Chan that appeals to so many people? It's not only that he does all his stunts for real, but he seems like a natural, care-free, fun-loving kind of guy. In every film he's been in, you can't help but notice his enthusiasm, even when he's starring in crap.And thus we segue to The Tuxedo, a sort-of spy spoof which Chan stars as Jimmy Tong, a reckless taxi driver with a crush on a woman working in an art exhibition. Because of his top-notch driving skills, he's hired as Clark Devlin's (Jason Isaacs) personal driver. Devlin is one suave fellow, with a fine tuxedo to boot, but he falls into a coma after an incident involving an explosive.Tong, as his good friend and employee, feels obligated to find out what happened to his boss so he dresses himself in Devlin's tuxedo, which apparently enables the wearer superhuman ability and agility. Posing as Devlin, Tong partners with a secret agent named Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) to expose a crime to poison the world's water supply.For a good twenty or so minutes, the film is actually pretty enjoyable fluff, with a cool car &quot;chase,&quot; which is really just Chan driving real fast, but fun to watch, nonetheless. However, once Hewitt is introduced as Chan's partner, the whole thing goes downhill with mindless blather about water. It seems the villain intends to poison the world's water supply so that only his bottled water is safe.Utter stupidity of the plan aside (poison water, ecosystem...dead, anyone?), it's just not the kind of set-up we want for a Chan flick. This isn't the first film he's posed as a secret agent (see the far superior First Strike or Who am I?) but this time around, it ultimately drags the picture down. For one thing, the film's most interesting character isn't Chan, it's Isaacs' Clark Devlin, who really is a cool and suave individual (Isaac himself has always been a very underrated actor).Chan is his enthusiastic self as usual, but when it comes to performing nifty stunts, forget it, the stuff here looks too manipulated, which entirely defeats the charm of watching Jackie Chan take on countless opponents. The humor isn't very good, either, with relentlessly predictable jokes (&quot;nice rack&quot;) and an astonishingly digressive segment involving Chan performing like James Brown, which is cringe-worthy, to say the least.Last, and possibly least, there's Jennifer Love Hewitt, who's a fairly pretty actress and as far as genuine talent goes...well, I've seen much worse (Denise Richards, I'm looking at you). But here, she's just annoying, called on by the script to do nothing but whine and complain. Worse yet, the movie never even opts to give us a good cleavage shot, which might have made the more annoying bits bearable.As far as story goes, the plot is lame, the villains make zero impression, and the gadgets...well, the tuxedo IS the gadget and it's not a very impressive one, at that. For superior martial arts entertainment, check out First Strike or Who am I?* 1/2 out of *****",The Tuxedo

735427,"The packaging with it's bright yellow strip encircling the boxcover stating ""Crime Scene-Do Not Pass"" riveted my attention to a dvd set of a program I had never even seen a commercial for on television so I took a chance by buying it and got very lucky as CSI Crime Investigation is a revolutionary new crime drama with each episode a murder mystery movie in itself so realistic that one learns so much about forensic science,facts,human nature,investigators' & criminals' mistakes,the legal system's way of taking this evidence to make arrests,the emotions that can sometimes get in the way of being unbiased and the fragile nature of crime scenes due to time factor,rain,multiple people in the scene,etc. The quality to the writing is amazing due to their keeping up with the latest in forensic science techniques-incorporating these sciences into each story. The investigators use common sense as well as they sometimes put their lives on the line putting their gloved hands in everythingwhether it be human remains or the garbage which always holds the unknown and undesirable. Many times what you may think to be fact is proven wrong by evidence. Theories are stated with no assumptions formed. After viewing CSI, the other crime dramas or crime thrillers on television seem outdated with less appeal.The cast is small yet effective. The opening & closing theme song "" Who are you ? "" by the musical group The Who applies to the entire program as many people are ""John Does"" or ""Jane Does"" unless they can be found. Computer technology is used on every show in addition to laboratory facilities,blood & tissue samples of victims & suspects,crime scene photos and routine questioning of many involved. The investigators make a conscious effort to notice every detail of everything making sure they see small things that otherwise are commonly overlooked.They also make sure to remember what they heard. Everything is obvious no matter how hard one may try to hide it. Cover-ups,serial rapists,killers and accidental deaths are solved by evidence and teamwork. The visual & sound effects along with re-creations of the crimes and crime scenes display intense training. Hopefully this exceptional program will continue in this way. This is a don't miss for people who appreciate great mysteries solved.The Dvd set is filled with 23 episodes that are 45 minutes each,A program this well written and acted is a welcome surprise.One can't compare this to any other crime drama-thriller on television as it is an entirely new approach.I Highly recommend Crime Scene Investigations to everyone who appreciates a great mystery solved. The seriousness of each episode is a very new and needed approach to crime drama television. There's something to look forward to as Season 2 of CSI is coming on dvd soon.",N/A
47906,"Talk about rolling snake eyes.  To begin with, your mission is numbered &quot;thirteen.&quot;  Then the pilot you've trained with is grounded prior to lift-off because he's allegedly been exposed to the measles; he's replaced by a young buck still wet behind the ears.  Once you're within spitting distance of the surface of the Moon an oxygen tank explodes.  Obviously, it takes oxygen to breathe, so now what?  Shut down everything in the command module, of course, shiver in the lunar module, and hope the gravitational tug from the Moon will slingshot you back home.And I thought I had my bad days.Yet the problems mentioned above merely scratch the surface of the true trials and tribulations of APOLLO 13.  Director Ron Howard recreates this gripping, compelling story, right down to beehive hairdo's and computers the size of Mt. Rushmore.  The drama, the sense of urgency--on the part of the astronauts, and the NASA staff in Houston frantically trying to save them--is so powerful and vivid I felt I was watching the actual event itself.  To magically weave the viewer into the story is a crowning achievement for any filmmaker, and here, Howard succeeds like a wizard waving a wand.Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Sinise headline a stellar cast in a grim race-against-time that had the entire world transfixed in April of 1970.  I remember being glued to the TV watching Walter Cronkite broadcast around the clock to give us the latest developments of the Apollo 13 story; I remember the relief and joy I felt when that banged-up capsule was retrieved from the ocean.  To relive the triumph--and near-tragedy--of this event is an awesome experience, and APOLLO 13 is awesome, indeed.--D. Mikels",N/A
705008,"There is only one reason to watch this movie: there are maybe 2 minutes worth of cut scenes that you CANNOT watch anywhere eles scattered throughout the &quot;Death&quot; segment of the film that take place within the T.V. series. The rest of the movie is scattered scenes from the T.V. series, (the &quot;Death&quot; segment) and the first 26 minutes of &quot;End Of Evangelion&quot; (the &quot;Rebirth&quot; segment).The scenes that can only be found on &quot;Death &amp; Rebirth&quot; are: Asuka talking to Kaji just before we meet them for the first time in the series, Shinji playing the string quartet at school and later being joined by the other three children who pilot the Evas (including Shinji's guy friend, whose name I have forgotten, as it's been quite some time since I watched the series, who pilots the fourth Eva only once when it is possessed by an angle and must be destroyed,) and they come in one at a time and play violins, and there is minimal dialoge spoken by Shinji and Asuka. Then there is Kaji's death scene. Actually we don't exactly see him die. He is shown standing outside by a huge fan, and then he looks at us and says,&quot;You're late.&quot; We don't see who comes to meet him. Fade to black, and in the English version we hear him shot, and then Shinji tells Asuka Kaji is dead. In the Japanese version we hear him slapped, and then Shinji tells Asuka Kaji is gone. This to me would seem to suggest that Kaji met Misato one last time, and then she slaps him and he leaves for good, while in the English version he meets an undercover contact who kills him. In both versions we then see Asuka call Shinji a liar.These scenes are the only reason to buy the VHS version of this film, and that's only depending on how badly you want to see the few minutes of new footage you can't see anywhere eles, and only if you don't have a DVD player. Rent it if you can find it at any video store, unless they don't have the language version of your choice. On the DVD there is a commentary option where you can listen to the thoughts of Amanda Winn, English voice actor of Rei, and two other guys who worked on it. The commentary is insightful and funny, (they apologize for using levity and say it is only to relive the depression of working on such a heavy series,) and the part of the commentary that runs through the &quot;Death&quot; segment can only be heard on the&quot;Death &amp; Rebirth&quot; disk. However, the commentary that runs through the &quot;Rebirth&quot; segment is the same commentary that plays over the beginning of &quot;End Of Evangelion&quot;. Also there is an option only on the &quot;D&amp;R&quot; disk that lets you access infromation while you watch the film for anyone still confused about anything.If the scant new footage that can only be found here, &quot;Death&quot; commentary, and information menu aren't enough to spark your interest, watch the T.V. series, (the first 24 episodes, anyway,) then skip this and go directly to &quot;End Of Evangelion&quot;.",N/A

528372,"To many Europeans, America is renowned for two things: movie musicals and an ever-growing prison population. In Lars von Trier's controversial DANCER IN THE DARK, the director/screenwriter finds a fascinating way to blend the two USA trademarks.Von Trier is a guerrilla filmmaker. His movies never unspool smoothly or flowingly. His camera work is jittery, abrupt, unfocused, and at times amateurish. These seemingly bad habits work well for his movies, which are all operatic, over-the-top, and raw looks at human behavior and misbehavior.Like his earlier classic BREAKING THE WAVES, which introduced the world to Emily Watson, this newer flick debuts Bjork in a powerful, emotionally naked performance. Just as Watson seemed to morph into the mentally challenged, naive, fragile wife in WAVES, Bjork doesn't just play the physically ill heroine, Selma, in DANCER. She becomes this Czech laborer, a mother who is going blind and is desperate to spare her son from the same medical death sentence.Bjork, an edgy singer/songwriter, provides the music for this rethinking of American song-and-dance epics. For those folks who think the film treatment of CHICAGO was dark, they should rent this title. Here is a weaving of tragedy and tap dancing, catharsis and choreography, shrieking and belting. It's not an easy blending to watch, and von Trier wants his audience to be uncomfortable.Everyone in the movie sings and dances, at different levels of proficiency. The participants will never be confused with Gene Kelly or Leslie Caron, Fred Astaire or Vera Ellen. Instead, the whole cast (David Morse, Catherine Deneuve, Peter Stormare from FARGO)is set loose to express their rage, desire, confusion, regrets via lyrics and movement. Even while they are trying to carry tunes, they are still supporting the weight of the script.Bjork is a revelation in this movie. She dares to look dowdy, unkempt, and REAL throughout. Her lack of vanity alone should have scored her an Oscar. I think there are very few actresses who would have consented and then courted such unflattering camera angles and cinematography. Her performance is so rich and so palpable that when her character exhibits fear and horror and animal terror at the end of the film, I actually felt my own stomach twisting and turning.The last shot of this movie is so harsh, so brutal, and so poignant, that I felt my mouth drop open. I knew it was coming, but I still couldn't believe my eyes. I have seen a lot of movies, and DANCER IN THE DARK doesn't easily belong to any category. It is a musical, a crime flick, a slice of rural life, and a budding, interrupted love story.Don't rent this if you want happily ever afters. Bear in mind, the finale will stay with you viscerally ever after.It's that intense. The DVD is packed with alternate takes, commentaries, documentaries, and a device that allows you to go to Bjork's music directly. Take advantage of the perks and expand your mind.",N/A

This video uses maybe two or three book camp-ish moves the rest is based mostly on modern dance, tae bo (kickboxing) and tai chi. There are three separate workouts.  None of them really give a good cardio or a good toning workout.  Put a couple of them together and it's decent, but not great.  The middle workout is the only one that uses hand weights.  There are several sections that are entirely too slow.  Mostly these involve learning a dance sequence or doing tai chi. The music is pretty cool; there are some drummers in the background, and the instructor is annoyingly chirpy.  I recommend the Crunch boot camp video instead which gives a better overall workout.",The Method - Cardio Boot Camp VHS

399258,"George Roy Hill's ""Hawaii"" (actually,like ""Gone With The Wind"", it was completed by several directors)is a splendid example of Hollywood epic narrative at its best.That it is so much less well known than the rather soggy ""Dr.Zhivago"", done the previous year, is incomprehensible, except perhaps as a testament to the truth of P.T. Barnum's famous comment about American popular taste. This comparison is particularly apt, because ""Hawaii"" has a great deal more to say about American verve and energy -- both its laudable desire to improve the world, and its darker tendency to dominate it -- than the David Lean film has to tell us about the Russian Revolution.Max von Sydow is nothing short of transcendent as Reverend Abner Hale, who has to rank as the least likable or approachable hero ever to inhabit the center of an American epic film. (Scarlett O'Hara, with her husband-stealing and attempted fornication, was a piker next to a man who denies spiritual comfort to a sailor who just saved a ship from wrecking,and who prays for the death of a new-born baby because it was ""conceived in sin"".)Sydow accomplishes something almost impossible, something that Nathaniel Hawthorne,that great poet of the Puritan tradition, would have understood perfectly: showing how a narrow, humorless man, motivated by pure righteousness,can do great harm AND great good at the same time. The fervor that leads Hale to cruelly demand the end of the incestuous -- and utterly loving -- marriage of Malama and Keoki Kanakoa is the SAME force that leads him to teach the Hawaiian people to read, to save unwanted babies from being put to death,and to protect the rights of the Hawaiian people to their lands.(How the devil did the Academy miss this performance when selecting the Best Actor nominees for 1966?)I might add that this is a lesson in the complexity of cultural imperialism which is especially needed right now, when the U.S. is preparing to remake the world in its image by force with an intensity that might have given even those New England mission folk pause.The rest of the cast is equally superb.Julie Andrews, as Hale's wife Jerusha, manages to convey the strength of a woman who finds the loving qualities in a man who seems to lack them with a sweet sincerity that has no whiff of feminism-avant-la-lettre about it. Jocelyne La Garde as the Alii Nui (Queen)of Maui, Malama, is so lovable that you FEEL her eventual death as you would that of a dear friend.Even the smaller parts, such as Torin Thatcher as the mission director and Gene Hackman as the courageous, humanistic missionary John Whipple, are memorable.This film also has some really lovely images and line readings in it.The sight of Mrs.Hale's worn face as she looks wordlessly down the country road after her son as he leaves for Hawaii, knowing that she will never see him again,is like an Andrew Wyeth painting.The transition of looks on Sydow's face at the end, when he meets the adult man whom Jerusha saved from death as a baby -- calling her to come out of the house, and then gradually remembering, through his mental fog, that the beloved wife he is calling has been dead for years -- is like a miniature recapitulation of the entire story we have just seen.But my favorite moment is the one where the mission representative asks Hale how he can bear to stay on as an old man in Lahaina ""without friends"".Sydow looks at him, with the ageless wisdom of an Old Testament prophet,and says: ""In this place I have known God, and Jerusha Bromley,and Ruth Malama Kanakoa; and beyond that a man has no need of friends."" Anyone who can stay dry-eyed through that line is made of sterner stuff than I.A treasure of a film , not to be missed.",Hawaii VHS

605263,"It is very hard for a director to make a truly great film today but it is even harder for a director to make two great films in one year. One director who is trying to do this is already known to be one of the greats: Steven Spielberg. Spielberg, who in years past brought us such classics as Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T., earlier this year directed the critically praised Minority Report. Unfortunately the film seemed to gather more media attention over the box office battle it had with Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch more then anything else. Now after directing box office draw Tom Cruise, Mr. Spielberg hopes to breathe new box office life into the ailing career of Leonardo DiCaprio by having star opposite Oscar winning actor, Tom Hanks. Will the experiment work and show that Spielberg still has the directing spark he had many years ago or will this be one of the few flaws in his career?The film follows the amazing and emotionally driven life of Frank Abagnale Jr. from his late childhood to the present day. At the beginning of the film, Frank Abagnale Jr. lives a normal life with his parents in a beautiful home but things quickly change. When his father runs into trouble with the IRS, the family is forced to move into a small apartment. This leads to Frank's mother cheating on her husband and eventually his parents divorce. Frank, alone and confused, can't handle this anymore and runs away from home. But things begin to look up as Abagnale makes a decent living for himself by disguising himself as an airline pilot and thus being declared the James Bond of the skies. Unfortunately Frank can't keep the job for long as his must keep moving so that a FBI agent named Carl Hanratty can't catch him. Hanratty is a very serious and determined man who will do anything just to place the cuffs on this little criminal mastermind. The plot for Catch Me If You Can, which is based on a true story, was very well done though it felt weighted in moments. There were several sequences that probably weren't necessary for the feature while the ending came off as being too long and flat compared to the rest of the film.All characters in the film were based on real life people and the cast does a magnificent job of presenting a delightful true life film. It wasn't much of a stretch for Leonardo DiCaprio, who takes the lead role as Frank Abagnale Jr., to play the ladies man but it has been quite some time since he played such a young character as the one he plays here. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a confused, lonely young man who continues the chase with Agent Hanratty not because he loves it but that he needs it. He needs the cat and mouse game with Agent Hanratty as well as the conversations he has with over the phone on Christmas to fill the void he is missing with his family. Quite surprisingly DiCaprio pulls off being a young character and shows great acting ability expressing this character. Agent Hanratty may not be an Oscar winning performance for Tom Hanks but does seem to be a role that he has a lot of fun with. Christopher Walken is fabulous as Frank Abagnale Sr. and really plays off Leonardo DiCaprio in the conversations the two characters have together. It is a shame that his character us not given as good of a send off as he should have had but it is not such a big deal. And Jennifer Garner, as gifted an actress as she may be, seems pointless in this film as her character doesn't really do anything overall for the feature.Overall, Catch Me If You Can is another good offering from the creative directing genius of Steven Spielberg but certainly isn't one of his greatest and not even close to the creativity of Minority Report earlier this year. The film is certainly a great diversion from the usual dramatic fares but Catch Me seems too slow and flat in portions of the feature. Besides those squabbles, everything else seems to click especially from the cast with the exception of Jennifer Garner's character, which has more to do with her character not really doing anything and not her acting ability. Catch Me If You Can is a nice film, though, for people to relax in without having to waste a very long time with or being too blown away with elaborate special effects. Catch this film, if you can. If not, don't worry too much about it.",Catch Me If You Can

The kids are in fact the most precious existence in this film, but is this not supposed to be an Eddie Murphy film, is it?Like his previous &quot;Pluto Nash&quot; disaster, Eddie is the least funny presence in this so-so comedy.  He is Charlie Hinton, who recently lost his job.  With his pal Jeff Garlin, he accidentally starts a day care center for kids, including his own named Ben.  His &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; center gets popular among the town, but the owner of posh preschool Chapman Academy, villainess Anjelica Huston (who hams it up like in &quot;The Addams Family&quot;), doesn't want them to be successful, and makes her sabotage plans.The film never avoids clithed moments, but that is not a big problem.  Director Steve Carr (previously working with Eddie in &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;) follows the formalua of family picture, and as this is a family picture, you don't need anything that might possibly offend adults or scare kids.  You should know that rule.But it is Eddie Murphy's film, and the problem is, anyone can play Charlie's role.  &quot;Nutty Professor&quot; clearly succeded owing to Eddie's tour-de-force performance, but no such magic here.  In other words, why Eddie?Having said that, I admit the film has good moments as some of the supports are wonderful.  One of them is underrated Steve Zahn, whose acting is funny enough to raise the film several notches higher even without now-clithed &quot;Star Trek&quot;-related gags.But the most wonderful are the kids; you might say your own kids are as cute as they are, and, right, but you cannot deny the charms of these fourteen kids.

324283,"John Ford's 1941 film How Green Was My Valley tells the story of a Welsh mining family, the Morgans, through the eyes of the youngest member of the family, ten-year old Huw (Roddy McDowell).  Mr. & Mrs. Morgan (Donald Crisp & Sara Allgood) have seven children and struggle to keep their family afloat.  Mr. Morgan is a miner, but he refuses to join a newly formed union and join in on their strike.  This creates tensions within the family and violence erupts.  Through it all the family survives, but their hometown and culture begin to decline.  Mr. Ford poignantly portrays the fading of childhood innocence and the good side and down side of life in a small town.  The film is still relevant today as Mr. Ford shows how technology dehumanizes society as machinery that is more efficient and cost-effective starts to replace many of the mine's best workers and renders them unneeded and forces them into unemployment.  The film beat out what is considered the greatest movie of time, Citizen Kane, to win the 1941 Academy Award for Best Picture and Mr. Ford beat Orson Welles to win his second consecutive Best Director Award (and the third of his total of four).  The film won three other Oscars including Best Supporting Actor for Mr. Crisp.  The film was to be shot in color on location in Wales, but due to the escalation of World War II, filming was moved to California and shot in black & white to help create the dreariness of South Wales.  This worked out brilliantly as the lack of color helps create more a bleaker mood and Arthur C. Miller was rewarded with an Oscar for Best Cinematography.",How Green Was My Valley VHS

247590,"While I admire the cinematic beauty of ""Nights of Cabiria"" and even its plot (as threadbare as it is, it's still good fun), by the time Fellini got to Juliet of the Spirits, he had really run out of things to say. Early on in the movie, there are harbingers of a plot, some suspense and even something verging on high drama, but none of these pan out, and instead we are left with.......a mess.Giulietta Masina is a very great actress, it is just that there wasn't much material for her to work with. It is too bad she hitched her wagon to husband Fellini's star her entire career, because if she were just in a few movies with plots, character development and finely crafted dialogue, we could have discovered the full range of her talent.In 1965, when this movie came out, there weren't so many movies about a woman's ""midlife crisis"" and her quest for ""fulfillment""; By now this plot has become a cliche. As far as the story line goes, ""Juliet of the Spirits"" has got to rank among the worst, even losing out to the B-movies and straight-to-video films that are grist for the mill on Lifetime and The Oprah Channel.And that is really a shame, because this is one of the most gorgeously filmed movies I've ever seen. Director of Photography Gianni di Venanzo's use of Technicolor is breathtakingly fascinating for its sumptuous use of warmth and its balance of colors and use of shocking hues. It rivals movies such as ""Fantasia"" and ""Vertigo"" for its artistic *visual* excellence.Yet, this movie taken as a whole is rambling, unfocused and pretentious in a genre that is not too difficult to master. Some call Fellini's movies ""surrealistic,"" and I have no argument with that. Perhaps my bourgeoise temperament lacks the patience to put up with it in two-hour-long doses. I prefer my surrealism in visual stills from Dali, Man Ray, Magritte.The irony of it is that the best movie of the ""woman finding herself"" genre -- ""Shirley Valentine"", directed by Lewis Gilbert -- is filmed so dryly that it borders on incompetence. Imagine what a movie that would have made were the script put into the hands of di Venanzo and Fellini with a soundtrack by the great Nino Rota.Altogether, viewing ""Juliet of the Spirits"" can be a pleasant experience, so long as one is concerned with camera work, editing, color timing and music.",N/A

476329,"Yeah, I know I'm a little late on this but in 1999 when I saw this movie for the first time I was so disgusted I promised never to watch it again. Well, after a couple of years on DVD I decided to give this one another chance.  It really didn't deserve it.The story is very simplistic.  Two Jedi Knights (Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi) are called to settle a trade dispute.  The planet Naboo has been invaded by the greedy Trade Federation and they demand that Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) sign a treaty giving them control of the planet.  Amidala flees the planet with her guardian Jedi and they have to repair their ship on Tatooine.  There they meet Anakin Skywalker.  Who just like Jesus was born to a virgin mother and may be &quot;the chosen one&quot; that will bring balance to the force.  Anakin is a slave and is freed after a long pod race in which he wins.  After this Anakin, the Queen, the Jedi, and our friend Jar Jar travel to Coruscant so they can pursuade the galactic Senate to intervene against the Trade Federation on their behalf.  Meanwhile Qui Gon Jin takes Anakin to the Jedi temple so Anakin can obtain permission to recieve Jedi training.  A very cranky Yoda says the boy is too old and dangerous to become a Jedi.  The very cranky Yoda orders Qui Gon to return to Naboo with the queen to protect her.  Back on Naboo a really big battle is fought and Qui Gon Jin dies and then Obi Wan kills a Sith Lord named Darth Maul.  Qui Gon has a funeral then there is a big celebration. The end.Okay, so the problems.  There is not an interesting character in this entire movie.  They are lifeless figures on screen whose dialog only serves to keep the plot moving along.  There is no real villian.  Darth Sidious spends the entire movie hiding in the shadows giving threats and Darth Maul only serves as a plot device to kill the Jedi.  His screen time is minimal and his character is hardly developed.  As a villian he has nothing on Darth Vader from the classic trilogy.  Another problem is Anakin.  I watched the documentary &quot;The Beginning&quot; and to be honest Jake Lloyd was the worst one who did a screen test.  I have no idea why they chose a kid who couldn't pronounce a lot of the words in the script.  Speaking of that documentary, Rick McCallum the producer serves as kind of a yes man to George Lucas.  His job is to tell the documentarian how great the movie is going to be.  I guess he gets paid a lot and his job would have been lost if he had been honest and said the story was terrible.  Then there were the Trade Federation guys.  Yeah, I know, a lot of you hate Jar Jar the most about this movie but he was not nearly as annoying as these Trade Federation guys.  They wear mask that look as if they were purchased in a dime store and talk in bad Asian accents.  When they guys are on screen I wonder if I am watching a Star Wars movie of the Power Rangers?  Okay, a lot of people think the saving grace of this movie is that Pod Race.  The Pod Race was modeled after that chariot race in a movie called Ben Hur.  But in Ben Hur there were real actors on real sets.  Not some kid in front of a blue screen.Just like Star Wars and Return of the Jedi, there is a battle station fight at the end in which our heroes most destroy the station.  And if you have no life like me you will have noticed that ROTJ ended with a funeral pyre, a celebration, and then end credits.  TPM also ends with a funeral pyre, a celebration, and end credits.  George Lucas had not directed a movie since the original Star Wars and it showed in this movie.  This movie is too mediocre to deserve the honor of a one star rating.  I give The Phantom Menace two middle fingers up.  Way up.",N/A

732108,"The WWE Confidential program is a show that tells the behind the scenes stories on many of the major events on WWE history, both current as well as those years in the past. This DVD is the first volume of the best of these stories.The DVD begins with the demise of WCW as a company and how one time hated rival Eric Bischoff was hired by the WWE. Very interesting stuff. We also see the reactions of Vince McMahon and Jim Ross to Steve Austin walking off the job and essentially quitting. There are family stories with Rikishi and all the Samoans in WWF history, and a story about the 3 generations of Orton wrestlers (with Randy Orton being the most recent). There is a little thing on Superfly Jimmy Snuka (as well as a bonus match with Snuka). We see the beautiful house of Trish Stratus, but the most interesting story on this DVD is that of the Montreal incident.The Montreal incident took place at Survivor Series 1997. Bret Hart did not have his contract renewed by the WWF and was leaving the company to wrestle with WCW. He was the champion at the time. He was told to drop the belt at Survivor Series to Shawn Michaels (yes, the results are fixed, if you didn't already know that). Bret said no, he claimed he had partial creative control of his character in his contract, and he refused to drop the belt to HBK (they really didn't like each other). The documentary Wrestling With Shadows gives Bret's side of the story, and shows (Bret was mic'd) Vince McMahon agree that Bret would lose the match, but not the title at Survivor Series and forfeit the title the next night on RAW. Vince doublecrossed him and even though Bret had not lost the match or submitted to the Sharpshooter, the referee called for the bell and awarded the match and the title to Michaels. In the locker room, HBK denied knowing about it, but came clean on Confidential saying that yes, he was a part of the doublecross. Very few people knew about it at the time, but it is the most infamous event in the WWE history. To this day, at WWE events in Montreal, ""you screwed Bret"" chants pop up. We see the WWE side of the story in this segment, and to be honest, I believe that both Bret and Vince were in the wrong in this whole debacle.DVD extras include:A classic Jimmy Snuka match (but not the one vs Don Muraco where he leaps from the top of the cage)Bret Hart vs Shawn Michaels, Survivor Series 1997Bret Hart vs British Bulldog, Summerslam, 1992Booker T vs Scott Steiner on the last night of WCW Nitro",N/A

The only sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, but I'd invite him in just out of pity.

216675,"Whether you love or hate this movie -- for it tends to polarize people --  depends largely on how much you believe in its central tenet: mankind is destined to leave the Earth to colonize other parts of the universe. Just to be perfectly clear, we are not talking about a brief space voyage and return to Earth, but irrevokably leaving our cradle. Those that grew up on ""Star Trek"" and ""2001"" are very familiar with this theme; but this movie was the pioneer. (This concept was greatly developed by the late Krafft Ehricke, who referred to it as the ""Extraterrestrial Imperative."")The special effects are of course dated, but I found a certain charm in them.Oh, yes -- there is one more noteworthy thing: the spaceship (or space-ark) is guided down a long incline before being redirected to a more vertical path at launch. There is actually some merit to this scheme. Because rockets are extremely inefficient when standing still or moving slowly, is is highly desirable to get them as fast as possible through this fuel-robbing phase. This principle of ""launch assist"" has been used in practice, but never on large vehicles. (The thinking is that the added complexity and risk are not worth it for large vehicles.) Incidentally, the idea of an acceleration ramp was first proposed by that great space pioneer Tsiolkovsky.",When Worlds Collide VHS
706722,"Ethan Hawke's Chelsea Walls is an interesting, multi-faceted portrait of life at the infamous Chelsea Hotel in New York city. The film is loosely-defined, shadowy, yet ultimately an engaging work of art unto itself.The film follows several storylines as it meanders along.. unfolding dramas between several 'major' characters in a sort of real-time exploration of their lives. There is the tortured writer whose alcohol fuels him and whose love interests try to soothe him, whether or not they ultimately succeed. A touching storyline (Kris Kristofferson and Tuesday Weld share an especially beautiful scene). The young couple who try to stay together and who share some beautiful, simple times, and have soft remnants of security in a very uncertain time (and place) (Rosario Dawson, wonderful as ever). The singer-songwriter and his friend, who though near each other physically are very much alone in spirit (the hugely talented, under-used Robert Sean Leonard (where is the Robert Sean Leonard romantic comedy?! I want one! Great to see him and Ethan Hawke are still working together after their wonderful, classic work in Dead Poet's Society, one of my favourite films) and Steve Zahn). There is Uma Thurman's struggling single woman, somewhat adrift on less-than-stellar relationships, but trying slowly and somewhat unsteadily to gain a sense of self, among several would-be suitors. There is the elder jazz singer, who waits for his moments to shine as he sings at a nearby club in the evenings (a nice touch is that Uma Thurman's character quietly goes about her business as a waitress in the same club.)All of these characters come together in a sort of montage.. the film has a real-life grittiness and fluid time which set it apart from most others.. one gets the feeling that this approach really is a good way to portray the Chelsea and its would-be denizens. Focus too much and you lose the sense of place, the fact that all these people and their stories are intertwined, as in real life. Tie them together any tighter and they would become too &quot;fictional&quot; and lose their freedom, their ability to change and reflect and be three-dimensional, real-seeming characters. Pull back from their stories any more, on the other hand, and it would become any other place, and the walls holding the story together would disappear, the essence of the film/place along with it.As this film went on and gathered momentum, I was drawn in more and more... as it came into the last 3/4, I was mesmerized, it became pure poetry, pure art, dancing on the scenes, the emotions, like undulating water in a lake at sunset... glimmering, gorgeous. If you are an artist, or simply love art, if you want to see visions of the would-be history of a very real-life historic place, see this movie. Hawke should be proud, it's a great work.",N/A
768662,"The wait is finally over, and it was worth it! Like I say in my title, this is not the best of Looney Tunes, but this selection of cartoons scanning the 1940's - 1950's is so wide and covers so many directorial styles and characters that complaints about content are moot - all the major characters of the studio are represented in this collection, and while the selections made don't always represent THE best of the best, there's not a dog in the set. As one critic said, &quot;The amazing thing about Warner Brothers cartoons is the good ones are classics, and the bad ones aren't a total loss,&quot; and that holds true for this collection. Just as it wouldn't make sense for the studio to release all of the best on one package, there are a good number of &quot;one shot&quot; cartoons - like &quot;Fair and Worm-er&quot;, that have no classic characters but are hilarious nonetheless - that would go unseen if not packaged with more recognizable cartoons.The extras are uniformly excellent and informative, from the commentaries to the featurettes to the documentaries, and as an added bonus, docs like THE BOYS FROM TERMITE TERRACE feature clips from unrestored cartoons that make you appreciate just how much work was put into this excellent collection.Are there other cartoons I would like to have seen in this set? Of course. But the very fact that Warner's (and the others, such as Jerry Beck, Stan Frieburg and Michael Barrier, to name only a few) put the amazing amount of work into this collection that they did proves that they respect not only the cartoons themselves but the expectations of the fans. It's very much appreciated and well worth the asking price.",N/A
770557,"The popcorn has finished popping, the couch is welcoming, the fun is ready to be had.How could you NOT like ""The Italian Job""? Once this movie crosses the finish line, you actually feel like you just regained that precious 105 minutes you lost watching...oh, hell, I don't know, ""Maid in Manhattan"".Donald Sutherland plays a thief who, with his crew members (Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Mos Def, Jason Statham, and Ed Norton), heist $35 billion in gold bullion from a Mafia safe. They think they're all set until one of their crew members turns on them during the end of the getaway. Sutherland is killed and the turncoat crew member escapes with the gold, nearly killing his teammates in the process.Flash forward, a year later. The turncoat is rich and Wahlberg has found him living in L.A.. Wahlberg assembles his original team to go after the turncoat, even enlisting the help of Sutherland's daughter who is a beautiful Mini-Cooper-driving safe-cracker(!). ""It's not about the gold! It's about payback!"", the movie boldly states although I wonder if there was no gold involved and it sunk with Charlie Croker's almost-doomed crew, whether they would go after the punk.This movie is like that small box of chocolates you get from your other half instead of the large box. It goes down easy and doesn't make you feel like you've overeaten. As sleek as the Mini-Coopers that coast through the sewers of L.A., this is a summer action picture with the works. It's as techno-horny as the two ""Mission: Impossible"" films, though less serious and as fast and furious as...well...the Fast and the Furious and even Gone in 60 Seconds. Though, it's less goofy and with a slicker and smarter plotline.A who-who's of young Hollywood talent is the main reason to see this movie. Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie, Ed Norton as the unpredictable Steve, Seth Green is the computer-hacking ""Napster"", Jason Statham is ""Handsome Rob"", the wheelman, Mos Def is surprisingly good as ""Left Ear"", the explosives man, and Charlize Theron rounds out the cast as Stella the Safecracker, the daughter of Donnie Sutherland's character, John Bridger (in a nice homage to the original Charlie Croker, played by Michael Caine in the 1969 film).I almost would have preferred that this film could have been a remake/sequel in which Sutherland was playing the elder Croker and Theron was the next-generation Croker (The beginning of the film feels like the veteran is handing the ball to the rookie) but, alas, Mark Wahlberg takes the reins and the film works on its own as a fine ""heist-the-loot-and-run"" ride.The script is witty and good fun. The good guys are smart, funny, and charming and have all the cool gadgets and you want to see the bad guy get his butt kicked in the end.85 percent of this film is shot in L.A., California which begs the question, ""Why is this called 'The Italian Job'?"" However, such intricacies are easily overlooked when you watch the film and you could simply chalk it up to the fact that it's in tribute/reference to the first film.This is the first film I have seen where, after it ended, I wanted to get in my car and drive anywhere at speeds exceeding 100 MPH without care that the cops might pull me over.--Matt",N/A

In the week between Christmas and New Year I actually heard one particularly talent-less hack say that History is the new reality TV, I mean please!The upside of this is that series like this one are made.  Simon Schama gives us what I suppose could be best described as a ""Whistle Stop Tour"" through the events and people who wrote the history of England, Britain and consequently the world in the past 1000 years.  Presented in a sometimes irreverent and always entertaining way, Schama takes the dusty old ornaments of history down from the mantelpiece and gives them a good scrubbing.  Long dead Monarchs and everyday people seem less distant, their motives more comprehensible, the man truly has a gift.In Britain, the BBC are often the subject of worry or doubts about it's future survival much less viability, with people looking back on a time when BBC was a byword for quality and lamenting a perceived decline in standards, but as long as she continues to produce this standard of programme auntie's health will never be a problem.",N/A

521975,"Far too many people hear &quot;anime&quot; and automatically have some bad connotation.  They think it's too childish or too mature.  This movie is a great place to start, whether you want to see anime or are completely turned off by the genre.  Why?  First, it was produced domestically by Disney, and you know they aren't going to put out something too racey or ridiculous.  Second, the voices are people you know, like Gillian Anderson and Billy Bob Thornton (and someone who sounds a lot like James Earl Jones).What else makes this so appealing?  Well, Billy Bob Thornton himself said that watching this, he forgot it was animated early into the movie.  The story is also compelling, with a rather Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy appeal.  The basic plot is that a boy must travel to find the Spirit of the Forest to have a curse removed from him.  On the way, he comes across a mining town, and the story moves into a &quot;harmony with nature&quot; kind of message.  Although it gets much more complicated, I'd prefer not to spoil too much of the movie.Besides the story and familliar voices, the animation in the movie is excellent.  For those who have watched a fair amount of anime, it becomes obvious that there have been dramatic changes in quality over time.  This move is recent enough that it has a high quality animation.",Princess Mononoke

94721,"Before director Joel Schumacher ruined the Batman film series with 1997's Batman &amp; Robin; he made his Batman directorial debut with Batman Forever.  With original director Tim Burton (who stayed on as producer) gone along with star Michael Keaton, the film allready had a lot going against it, but on it's own it is a solid action comic themed blast.

Kilmer proves to be a good Batman, but he isn't as convincing as Keaton was.  Carrey is great as the Riddler, and I can't picture anyone else (Robin Williams was originally considered for the part) playing him.  Jones overacts quite a bit as the maniacal Two-Face, and O'Donnell seems a bit wasted as the boy wonder.

When asked why he did it, the gunman says, ""God told me to."" He then takes a swan-dive onto the street below. Nicholas is a very religious man and is fascinated with the idea of God telling anyone to commit mass murder. The murders keep happening. A man goes to the market and stabs a bunch of customers. Andy Kaufman is a cop who goes berserk at the St. Patrick's Day parade and shoots cops and bystanders alike. Another guy kills his entire family and calmly waits for the police.

He seeks out a young man with long blonde hair who was seen with all the killers just before their crimes. He finds the blonde man's mother, who promptly tries to kill him.

In the first film, we learn fascinating lessons about mountain climbing and this part of Asia during the rise of the Nazis, and in the second we learn about Tibet and the young Dalai Lama.  That said, this is an extremely entertaining film that's beautiful to watch, if we can get past our dislike of Pitt's character.

This is very evident at the very beginning. We're in a country kitchen in the middle of nowhere, it's almost eight o'clock, and there is absolutely nobody except for this young and attractive waitress. But, the tension climbs high up just five seconds later, as a mysterious young man enters the eatery. And, indeed, the whole story is about the mystery of this man, who claims himself to be hiding from his friends. The storyboard is quite interesting, in addition to having a known feeling to it, as a thriller-fan would sense it immediately. Yet it is good.The direction is meticulously done. Juxtapositions in tension scenes are indeed excitement-stressing, such as the young man's dealing with his wound in the most ungentle fashion and the coffee droplets dripping from the coffee machine, making a 'bizzzz' on the metal surface.Blood, which is a part of most thriller films, is well used. It's not excesive; it's minimally used, yet very efficiently. I think it&quot;s the fear on the victims that thrill us more, and not the blood.The end is very interesting.

309602,"Most James Bond fans have their personal favorites among all the films in this forty-year series:  FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is mine.  In many ways, this was actually the first film with the full James Bond formula in tact.  DR. NO was enjoyable, but Sean Connery's Bond was very different in that film than in the subsequent films.  In DR. NO, Bond was a serious, unironic, humorless secret agent, very much like the character in the Ian Fleming novels.  In FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, Bond departed from the character in the novels, and became witty, ironic, and very much tongue-in-cheek.  In short, he became the Bond we all know and love.  This is also the first film in which Desmond Llewelyn appeared as Q, who went on to play in all the remaining films (excepting Sean Connery's comeback with a different studio).  Q provides Bond with his trick attach&eacute; case, the first of the many gimmicks we associate with Bond.  The story is a great improvement as well.  On top of this, the villains in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE represented a huge leap forward from DR. NO.  In the list of the great Bond villains, both Robert Shaw's Donald 'Red' Grant and cabaret legend Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb rank near the top.  Shaw comes across less as a human being than a highly programmed cyborg, and Lenya's sadistic turn as a poisoned-knife-in-shoe harpy has been often imitated.The setting for the film, Istanbul, is one of the best in the entire series.  It perfect set the international tone for all subsequent Bond films.  The city is used as a perfect backdrop for much of the film.  Among all the other distinctions of this film, it also belongs on the short list of the great train films, with much of the film taking place on the train that travels along the route of the former Orient Express.  The only film that I think rivals this one in the James Bond series is the immediate sequel, GOLDFINGER, which is my second favorite Bond film.By the way, this is one of the few films in which Bond does NOT say, ""Bond, James Bond.""",N/A

497416,"As the film debut of Christopher Nolan, Following showed serious promise. While not perfect, its manipulation of time and use of the film noir genre is admirable and proved to be the precursor to his first widely released and superior Memento.Following is about a man with the habit of following strangers, and what happens when one of them turns out to be a follower himself. The film cleverly mixes up time, showing scenes out of order to raise questions to what later happens to the follower. At the beginning, he's long haired and unshaven, but in other scenes he's cleaned up and others he's bruised and beaten up. It's a wonderful technique to keep the audience involved in the film. We know he must get into some serious trouble, but we don't know what or why. The film's black and white photography, while likely chosen more for its inexpensive trait, complements the film noir aspects of the storyline.However, mostly due to the small budget, the acting isn't too great. Only the thief character named Cobb whom the follower gets involved with is convincing in his role. Everyone else feels like a B-movie actor, and not very good ones at that. But another downfall of this film isn't much a fault of its own. Nolan's later film Memento tells another noir story in a very similar style, but with amazing fashion (telling the story completely backwards) and a story arc (A man with a memory disorder after his wife was murdered) that far outshines Following's smaller ideas. Here it seems he was just beginning to toy with time and scene order in film, so he'd really get it right in Memento.Overall, Following is a decent little flick that is better rented before being purchased. Fans of Memento may find it especially interesting to see how the director began shifting time and scenes around in preparation for his later mind bender, but the average film viewer might want to skip it and check out the superior Memento instead.",Following

287653,"The 1932 film ""Red Dust,"" the first cinematic pairing of platinum blondeshell Jean Harlow and the virile Clark Gable, is obviously inspired by the success of Somerset Maugham's ""Rain.""  Once again we have a fallen woman, Vantine Jefferson (Harlow), a Saigon prostitute, running from the police who hides out on an Indo-China rubber plantation run by an unshaven Dennis Carson (Gable).  Harlow's character talks tough, but she is a sizzling sexpot (this is the film where she takes a bath in a rain barrel) who sasses him back every time he tries to give her the business.  Soon he falls for all of her vamping and tries to get her to accept some meony so she can start her life anew some place else.The next boat arrives at the plantation and delivers engineer Gary Willis (Gene Raymond) and his wife, Barbara (Mary Astor).  Willis has been stricken with fever and while he recovers Carson forgets about Vantine and falls for Barbara.  Then things start getting really complicated.  But the main attraction here is these characters wallowing in sins of the flesh in a film made two years before the Code cleaned up Hollywood (and five years before Harlow's death at the age of 26).  You will never think the same thoughts about your favorite cheese again after watching Harlow and Gable tackle the subject.  Gable acts the part of a first-rate cad for most of the film while Harlow drips innuendo about her sleeping habits.  Even Astor as the adulterous ""Babs"" has her moments, as when she and Gable share their first kiss after he rescues her from a monsoon that leaves her drenched.""Red Dust"" is one of those black & white pre-Code films that is steamier than the vast majority of contemporary films that try to deal with the idea of sex.  The film was directed by Victor Fleming (uncredited) and is based on a play by Wilson Collison.  This was the first of two films that Gable made with Fleming before the director was called in to save the actor from George Cukor on ""Gone With the Wind.""  Harlow and Gable would be united again the following year in ""Hold Your Man,"" in 1935 in ""China Seas,"" 1936's ""Wife Versus Secretary,"" and in her last film, 1937's ""Saratoga.""",N/A
605405,"But I love great work, and this is a great movie.  Rob Marshall has taken the Bob Fosse musical to the screen with such imaginative direction, editing and choreography that he has made it his own.  Not a copy of Fosse, but a nod to him while being fresh and new.  Fast on its feet and clever as hell, it benefits from great original material that is funny, sexy and smart.The surprising cast of Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, Latifah, Gere and Reilly are uniformly terrific.  Who knew John C. Reilly has a beautiful Irish tenor?  They all learned their chops and performed them admirably.I applaud Rob Marshall  not only for the  clever and imaginative construct of constantly cutting back and forth from ""real"" sets to stage, and the rapid razzle dazzle of the editing and direction throughout, but also for bringing the picture in at 107 minutes.  Many directors today do not know how and when to end their films and they go on and on forever passing a half dozen places they could have ended it (the exception being Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films that are actually better in the extended versions).  Chicago gets right to it and never lets up.As I titled this review, I am usually not a big fan of musicals, but this film blew me away.  Just great work throughout and it is a real MOVIE, not a filmed play.  For once in a long while, I can't argue with the Best Picture awarded this film.  Five stars all the way.",Chicago
739196,"I've seen all of Michael Moore's films, and enjoyed them all, and I believe this is the best film he's made.  In the past I've sometimes been uncomfortable when Moore puts underlings on the spot, harassing them for the actions of corporate heads, but happily that never happens here.  Instead, each scene is thoughtful and insightful, raising provocative questions that any thoughtful person -- conservative or liberal -- should ask themselves about violence in this country.  I've long been interested in this issue and have read a lot, but I still found surprising information here.  It's easy to think that we are more violent (with over eleven thousand gun deaths a year) because we watch violent movies and play violent video games -- but so do the Japanese; it's easy to think we may be more violent because we have a violent past -- but so do Germans; it's easy to think we might be more violent because we have so many guns in this country -- but so do Canadians.Moore travels to Littleton Colorado, Flint Michigan, California and Canada, and he speaks to law enforcement officials, teachers, Marilyn Manson, Charleton Heston and Columbine students as he tries to piece together what makes America so uniquely violent.  Moore and his team come up with some answers, but even more questions, in this important film.DVD extras are plentiful and include: a trailer; a short introduction by Moore; a 15-minute monologue about his Academy Award acceptance speech (though the Academy wouldn't let Moore use footage of the event); film commentary by secretaries, interns and production assistants; a talk Moore gave to a Littleton, Colorado, crowd in February 2003; a 16-minute featurette about the film's reception at Cannes, the Oscars and the Toronto Film Festival; and Marilyn Manson's ""Fight Song"" music video.The issue of violence in America should supersede politics, and Moore does not mention politics in the film.  When so many of us have been touched by violence, it is in ALL our interests to try to make sense of it and improve the situation.  Do conservatives OR liberals want to live in a world where we are afraid, where we are victimized, where we are torn from friends and relatives by violence?  This is an important issue and Moore has made an important film.  Great viewing with a group -- lively discussion afterward!",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Sometimes it seems like Jennifer Lopez has the opposite problem -- either that, or the movies don't make a lot of sense. Fortunately that problem doesn't apply here.Jennifer plays Mary Fiore, a single wedding planner who her father, Salvatore (Alex Rocco), desperately tries to set up with Massimo Lenzetti (Justin Chambers), a childhood friend of sorts. After a while Massimo even gives everyone else the idea that he and Mary are engaged. If things aren't hectic enough as it is, Mary's latest wedding involves Steven ""Eddie"" Edison (Matthew McConaughey), a man she met at the park that appeared to be single and coming on to her.I enjoyed everything about this movie, although I couldn't understand why it took Mary so long to tell Eddie that she and Massimo weren't really engaged.

785600,"I will be the first to admit that I am quite fond of Alien 3 narratively and visually, but also recognize it as a departure from what had been set up in the first two films.  I will also admit to the utter dissapointment I felt when I first saw Alien Resurrection in theaters (but have warmed to it over the last six years - mainly for its visual presentation being the best of the series and having Ron Perlman in it), but this is an amazing DVD set.In the mold of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions this set gives you everything Alien you could ever want.  All the movies are digitally restored and presented beautifully (highlighting the look of Alien Resurrection against the other three when viewed back to back to back to back).  There are two versions of every film (commentaries on each version by cast and crew - noted absences are Fincher, Weaver, and Khondji) and even though the original theatrical releases are ultimately the better, more balanced and paced cuts in every case it is interesting to see some of the deleted scenes worked back into the films.  And the supplemental materials go on forever.Alien is a masterpiece.  Aliens is a close second (close).  Alien 3 is an intriguing work almost apart from the series.  And Alien Resurrection is not without merit.  That said this collection makes even the more difficult moments of the third and fourth films worth watching again and gives us a greater appreciation for Ridley Scott's vision and James Cameron's extrapolation of that original vision.Cameron's commentary is not to be missed.",Alien: Quadrilogy (Alien / Aliens / Alien 3 / Alien Resurrection)

595412,"A clever, well directed but, ultimately, underwhelming suspense science fiction thriller Signs gets much right but just as much wrong. Clearly Night has tremendous talent as a director. While the characters are well drawn, the performances very good and the central idea interesting, the last act needed some work. Working solo as writer and director Night probably didn't get much input from another creative force. He could have used it with Signs.The McGuffin is the threat of alien invasion. Really, it could have been set at any time during World War II with the Nazi's. It's just the catalyst to drive the plot forward. The alien invasion itself is pretty tame and not very well thought out. The motives for invasion unclear, the reasons they leave also a mystery.The film is visually stunning and visually interesting using a lot of unconventional camera angles and stylistic choices to make the film interesting despite the flawed script. It's what Night doesn't show that frightens us more than seeing everything. It's a classic lesson that's been forgotten by most film directors. Night shows an understanding of suspense not seen since Spielberg's early days. He also avoids the cliches that Spielberg avoided early in his career and has only recently escaped from (for the most part).The DVD is stunning looking with sharp images and beautiful color. The beautiful transfer and resolution is most noticable during the night sequences particularly when Gibson first sees the ""monster outside my window"". The extras are nice with an excerpt (like some of his previous DVD's) from the films Night made as a youth. The multi-angle storyboard option is also nice as well giving us an inside understanding of the film making process.The only suggestion I would have made for improvement would have been to allow viewers to view the preview version vs. the final version. It would have, again, been interesting. Sometimes the preview version is superior to the final film (e.g., Jim Cameron's The Abyss). Overall, this is a fine DVD with a set up that doesn't quite have the eventual payoff it needs to succeed. It's still a riveting film for the first two-thirds of the film. Enjoy and keep your eye on Night as he's a major talent that's still finding his way.",Signs

Let's first look at the exceptional performances from the cast:Chris Sarandon - plays the school teacher of the younger sister (Mariel Hemingway) who rapes the older sister first and then the younger sister after being acquitted of the first crime.  He really comes across as the creep he is intended to.  You grow to hate him, which is the point.Mariel Hemingway - her acting debut in which she shines.  A great performance.Ann Bancroft - plays the lawyer convincingly.  An all round great actress.Margaux Hemingway - the lead actress, and real-life sister of Mariel (unfortunately died tragically in mid 90's). Not a great actress by any means but she had her moments in the film.  Pity about her voice.  She was actually a model in real life then, rather than an actress.The film bombed upon release in 1976 possibly because audiences couldn't accept Margaux trying to switch to acting.

It's awesome man!The movie is better than the cartoon, and that's saying a lot. Spider-man's costume looks so cool, as does the Green Goblin's (Willem Dafoe). The action sequences are fast-paced and riveting, and Danny Elfman's musical score is rich and powerful. Well, here is the real reason why Spider-man is so great:Remember how it was easier to be entertained as a kid? I do. I remember that during every Power Rangers episode (at least the old-school ones), I would wait in suspense until the morph battle at the end. ...the Megazord would take one swift swing at the evil monster with his awesome blade, and the bad guy he would fall dead, helpless to the amazing power of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. See, what the power Rangers did for me then, Spider-Man does for me now. I didn't just pass the movie off as comic book nonsense. I was like whoa. Spider-Man is the real deal.And, hidden beneath all the wondrous action and comic book drama (which is by no means a bad thing), there's a message from the hero: ""With great power, comes great responsibility.""

But then I look at how YOUNG Newman and Redford are in the film and how craggy and `well-seasoned' they look now and figure, yeah, that was a long time ago. The pairing of these two actors was brilliant; the chemistry between them, the way they can play off each other's strengths, was recaptured years later in The Sting.BC and the SDK starts of as a loopy set piece of two giddy train robbers just living from one holdup to the next one - but then they rob the wrong guy and he hires a world-class tracker (""Who ARE those guys?"") who just won't give up. They keep running - all the way to Bolivia.And okay, maybe the bicycle scene in the meadow with Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head is schmaltzy - but didn't you love it?

12528,"This is a resoundingly misunderstood film.  Probably the finest parody ever made of the action genre as a whole; this film mocks the absurd excesses that most summertime action blockbusters indulge in.  The script is clever enough to divide itself between the dark brutality of the real world and the campy superficiality of Hollywood.  It revels in poking fun of the very films that have made Arnold Schwarzenegger (in?)famous.The world outside the silver screen is filled with stark reminders of how un-Hollywood life is.  There is crime, bullets hurt good people, and extras that are killed have families they've left behind.  Young Danny (Austin O'Brien) loves film more than anything else.  He attempts to put aside the problems of his life in live in the world that Hollywood has created for him.  His favorite indulgence is the Jack Slater series of films.  They star Arnold Schwarzenegger as the title-hero, a cop modeled after the cloned result of Dirty Harry and Rambo.  Slater is a smooth operator who never makes a wrong step and never fails to land on his feet.  He is essentially everything that Danny, and in reality most children, wish they could be.  When he is given a magical movie ticket by Nick the friendly pathetic mildly wise projectionist at his favorite theater, Danny is transported beyond his world into that of his hero, Jack Slater.  He is quickly engulfed in one of the most entertaining action sequences ever put to film.  It is the crystallization of the genre where there is unexplained action and unnecessary and unequal reaction.  A car explodes because another car goes near it.  A would-be assassin is thrown from his perch atop a moving truck into a parked ice-cream truck that then explodes.  A truck explodes in the air for no good reason, and meanwhile, all the women are attractive (by Hollywood standards).  They move from action sequence to action sequence, all of which are completely superfluous and equally delightful.  Anyone who has ever made fun of, or rightly criticized, the films of Jerry Bruckheimer would find this work profoundly amusing.  On screen, Slater and Danny must confront the cycloptic henchman Benedict (Charles Dance) and his benefactor Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn) in order to stop a takeover the SoCal black market and to extract revenge for the killing of Slater's favorite second cousin.  This plot of course, is secondary to the parody.  It moves well and revels in its self-justifying fictional world where a cartoon cat can be a cop, because it's normal there.The other side of the screen is filmed with dim lighting and always hinting at danger beneath the surface.  Danny's mom (Mercedes Ruehl) is a widow who struggles to support her child both materially and emotionally.  She works the unglamorous midnight shift.  Nick is a washed-up never-was who had dreams of another career and justifies compromises he has made to his goals by referring to his job in the manner, &quot;Hey, it's still show business.&quot;  When Slater enters this world, and gets shot, not only do the bullets hit him, but they cause more than flesh wounds.  In the &quot;real world&quot; the on-screen villains can take advantage of corrupt systems to come out on top.This film parodies not only action heroes and the action genre, but also bad scripts.  Danny knows not only what has already happened in the movie, he can accurately predict the next steps of the transparent plot of the action film he was watching and then participates in.  The film makes groan-inducing puns and points them out.  The film points out how action films sometimes modify classics to fit into modern pop culture.  This movie could have been a bit shorter and could have done without some of the melodrama in the &quot;real&quot; world.  But those are miniscule flaws next to the eminently enjoyable rest of the film.",The Last Action Hero VHS
584672,"&quot;HULK&quot; by filmmaker Ang Lee isn't a film for everyone.  It's not for the kiddies, it certainly isn't for comic purists, and people looking for dumb blockbuster-style fun will be sorely disappointed.  However, Lee has re-envisioned the comic book opera by treating it with as much seriousness as it deserves (it's a *drama*, folks!) and come out with something new and refreshing, not to mention reflective of a better time for moviegoing--specifically, he's recalled the genre of the 1930s-40s Universal horror film, i.e. &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; certainly, though updated it to the 21st century--pretty much only in its vastly superior special effects and budget.Bruce Banner, introverted scientist, has spent his life subconsciously working toward the answers to questions that have plagued him since childhood--&quot;Who am I, why am I here?&quot; and the answers--in the form of an egomaniacal father and a misunderstood manifestation of Banner's brutish id--frighten him, justifiably so.  Monsters abound in the script (in different ways--David Banner, Bruce, Talbot, Ross), and nobody's totally innocent or entirely 'good' or 'evil' as such, they're three-dimensional iterations that really make you think.When the Hulk displays his vast powers for the camera, he's every bit the creature from the comics, leaping vast distances through panoramic desert vistas, exploding through labyrinthine corridors of a government base, smashing and destroying a lab by virtue of his size just as well as his fists--it's all terrific eye-candy.  The film dares you to understand his all-too-human conflicted nature--the Hulk, flawed much like us, cannot forget the past his father inflicted upon him, just like the nanomeds that combined with the gamma radiation and Banner's own biology to create him, will not, as their often fatal flaw, forget.  As referred to in a terrifically illuminating deleted scene, they remember all too well.&quot;HULK&quot; is a first-rate, instant classic from director Ang Lee and a studio I did not believe had the potential to make a film so terrific ever again.  Watch it and enjoy the human drama at its core; give it a chance.  Time will tell whether Lee's auteurship really impacted this film positively or negatively, but I've already got my mind made up that it sits at the forefront of not only the comicbook genre, but also 21st-century filmmaking as a whole.",N/A

425861,"I'm a big Howard Stern fan however, I'm giving this movie 3 stars because it falls short of living up to the geniune vulgar comedy present in the book. yeah I said vulgar and its damn funny.This film hardly shows us  Howards  funny but, true childhood expereinces such as when his mother made him wear her underwear to school because all of his were dirty.  We didn't see him get  beat up by blacks when living in a predominantly black community. We didn't see his comical sexual experiences during his adolescent years as he described in this book. The list goes on and those were the funniest parts of the Book yet, this movie didn't take advantage of it.It appeared Ivan Riteman (whatever way his name is spelled) chose to only focus on Howards career & marriage and put a lighthearted spin on it. Yeah, I know Howard eggxagerates his personality on the radio but, the book had more of a politically incorrect NC-17 tone to it. This Movie however, fails to capture that but, instead makes Howard  into a  likeable goodhearted person. That was obviously Paramount's strategy to make this film appeal to a broad mainstream audience however, That clearly backfired since it only earned 42 Million and most of that revenue came from loyal Howard Stern Fans.  I think this movie could have been the funniest movie ever made if the director used Howards book as a blueprint, however it ends up being a tame watered down version of what it should have been.",Private Parts VHS

The title of this film ""UNFAITHFUL"" says it all.  I will not reveal the story here because very few good movies are made these days.  This one is a doozy.  I had just finished watching AN OFFICIER AND A GENTLEMAN (1982) and decided to rent this dramatic film.  Olivier Martinez (They say, the actor who has it in his contract he will not do a full nude scene) is interesting as the other man.

Richard Gere proves again how professional and good he is as an actor.This DVD version contains two alternate endings and deleted scenes.

But instead of biting sarcasm and rampant deviltry, the viewer is subjected to endless full-blown musical numbers written for children.  Watching this movie was like watching 2 hours of Barney videos.  Instead of treating children's icons like pinatas, this movie is an homage to them.  The script was written for children.  It completely lacks adult humor, and any humor at any level period.  The lone exception is one scene by robin Williams, where he slams into a brick wall during a spoof of Singing in the Rain.

Fortunately, &quot;POV&quot; and &quot;Secret World Live&quot; were amazing, and now comes &quot;Growing Up&quot;, featuring a Gabriel so old that he no longer need wear the old man mask that he used to close out &quot;The Musical Box&quot; with, but in great form nonetheless.&quot;Up&quot; was a good album, vastly overlooked, although the tour did sell tickets and gave millions throughout the world good exposure to some of the darkest, artiest material in his entire career.  &quot;The Barry Williams Show&quot; might still make one wince (the singer seeming a little out-out-touch with a trend that peaked years before this song was finally released), but the rest is soulfully performed.  Even &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, which has become a bit of a mill around his neck, still sounds fairly fresh and comes at the right point in the show.

Still, this is a must-purchase if you are a Gabriel fan and not a bad intro to his later work (the show concentrating almost exlusively on songs from 1986 and after; one small disappointment being that absolutely nothing from &quot;PG III&quot; or &quot;Security&quot; was performed).

509742,"I saw this movie when it first came out to the theaters.  I had been fore-warned about some &quot;unsettling&quot; scenes at the beginning of the movie.  Indeed, there is a graphic depiction of the horrors of war that should leave all viewers ill at ease (to say the least).  Many people may object to these scenes.  I came to the conclusion that Spielberg intended to give his audience a glimpse of the horror and chaos of war.  I believe that he did so, not so much to shock us, but to give us a greater appreciation of what our veterans endured in times of war (and that, in turn, IS shocking).  If this movie had accomnplished nothing else, it deserves our appreciation for that one aspect.  I think that we at home appreciate the risk and the sacrifices that our men and women in the military services accept.  We just never got such a lesson in what they went through before.  Imagine having to keep your wits about you when all that carnage is happening all around you to people you know and care about.  I think that this movie will be shown regularly on Memorial Day and Veterans Day as well it should.That issue aside, there is a lot more to this movie and, again, it all points towards honoring the commitment of our men in uniform.  The very beginning of the movie sets us up for the idea that we are seeing this movie from the perspective of a veteran.  The story evolves that a group of soldiers are asigned a special task during the D-Day invasion aftermath.  The assignment itself seems impossible and there are times that a number of the men want to quit.  This serves as a reminder that soldiers aren't consulted on their missions, they simply go out and do what they are required to do, regardless of how much sense it makes.  Ultimately, the men, and the movie, reach a climatic point and we are reminded again about the horrors of war.  The movie concludes back in the present with a moving scene that shows the depth of the camaraderie of men that served in combat together.This movie boasts many things including outstanding acting and direction.  The special effects, as mentioned, are outstanding.  There is a message about combat that is disturbing but very honest.  We see men doing things that appear very wrong to us sitting in our comfortable seats.  We see men who rise to the task as well as men who fail to meet the task.  This reminds us all that these soldiers are men who were called to battle.  They are like us but we are not like them.  They are in the arena and we are not.  What would we have done, how would we have coped, how would our comrades remember us?  All these questions are thrust at us and it underscores the message of the film; we have always lived amongst heroes who went off to war and quietly came back home.  Watch this movie and you will be better able to appreciate the veterans in your community.",Saving Private Ryan VHS
205216,"This truly unusual and period movie (the 60's) was a subject of comment by the original author of the popular book, Ray Bradbury. He claimed that the movie improved on his original book ending. The direction here has probably one of the greatest improv's of film. In the beginning there are no words used to introduce the movie. Rather we are shown a sequence of Television antenna-laced rooftops and the ""titles"" are spoken. This continues as our hero picks up a ""newspaper"", but upon close inspection we see that it is only picture sequences. The best aspect of this work is the score. Bernard Hermann is responsible for what can only be described as ""atmospheric"" music and it is a standout. Oscar Werner, in all fairness, was crucified by critics for his performance and the way he played the central character, in retrospect, this was unfair and I sometimes believe that critics make comments without reading anything about the material. Werner obviously read the book!Remember that ""firemen"" in this future society are not ""intellectuals"" and what we see is how he eventually wakes up and discovers the value of knowledge. Werner plays this perfectly, and he eventually values knowledge more than his life, after the shock of witnessing a suicide by an old woman who refuses to leave her books as they are burned. In reality the director wanted to show how a man transforms from his discovery of the word and the re-discovery of the ""I"". (ala' Ayn Rand) In the end, he flees the controlled, drug infested and false reporting society of the city to live with a group in the outskirts of civilization intent on preserving the great books of culture during the dark age of this dismal future.

Jack and friends need to find two green-eyed girls before the villain, David Lo Pan, marries them and becomes mortal.  Jack has to fight through Lo Pan's fortress, trying to get through the three guardians, who look like Mortal Kombat characters.The acting is good, with Kurt Russell playing the macho action hero to a stereotypical, ""I fear nothing"" level.

316247,"THE UNINVITED is a truly top-notch haunted house film. The story has lots of spooky moments and the ghostly manifestations are presented with subtlety, leaving much to the imagination of the viewer. Lighting is used effectively to heighten the mood, and, having been filmed in 1943, there is no special effect overkill to make it seem hokey.Besides the haunting aspects of this film, it is an excellent movie in most other respects, as well. The acting is first-rate, the music is lovely, and the scenery is as beautiful as it is appropriate to the mood. The tension builds steadily as the romance between Londoner Roderick Fitzgerald (Ray Milland) and local girl Stella Meredith (Gail Russel) progresses. Ruth Hussey does a fine job in the role of Fitzgerald's increasingly edgy sister, and Donald Crisp is excellent as Stella's over-protective grandfather.THE UNINVITED is an excellent movie and one of the best ghost stories on film to date. In terms of pure hair-raising, spine-tingling chills, the original 1963 version of THE HAUNTING is tops, in my opinion. THE UNINVITED isn't far behind, though, and in terms of overall production values, it doesn't get any better than this. A great addition to any video collection.",N/A

The way the film was shot was simply marvelous accenting his script.  In my opinion Anderson is a &quot;sound director.&quot;  The mood and the feel of the movie depend heavily on sound.  The soundtrack is vital in Punch-Drunk, from the frantic interactions with Sandler to the romantic scenes with Watson.  The talent on this film get kudos also.  Anderson regulars Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman were as always great.  I've really started to enjoy Emily Watson also, her talent with every movie I see her in is really impressive.

This second season is much better, especially Keifer Sutherland.  The dark and disturbed edge of Jack Bauer this season brings much more depth to his character and is never overblown.  While I originally thought offing his wife in the first season was a mistake, it led to a great change in his character.  Xander Berkley as George Mason is also a very well done tragic character.My main complaint is Kim.  My friend called her ""a walking Darwin award"" and I couldn't agree more.  There seems to be a problem in 24 with most of the women being either stupid or manipulative (which is another reason not to give this 5 stars), but she's by far the dumbest.  Whenever they go to her subplot I cringe, and then laugh while they're playing out.  I see the need for a tie to Jack's family, but the writers either need to get her better integrated into the story, stop her from running into every sleazy guy stereotype (the loner militia guy, the cartoonish wife beater), or just get rid of her altogether.Otherwise, I really enjoy this show.

This is a perfect film for history teachers to show their students.  The performances are very natural and winning.  Peter Gabriel's score is excellent - with the music playing over the closing credits being some of his best work ever (and appearing in a slightly different form as &quot;Sky Blue&quot; on his 2002 album, _UP_).If you have seen this movie and enjoyed it, the DVD is a keeper.  The audio commentary from Noyce is superbly done.  In addition to giving the viewer background as to how and why he did the movie, he also offers up some interesting tidbits about the difference between working on mainstream films (&quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger,&quot; &quot;Sliver,&quot; etc.) and smaller films like &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; and &quot;The Quiet American.&quot;  A good documentary is included as well.",Rabbit-Proof Fence
577607,"A Film by Christopher GuestI'm probably one of a few, but I wasn't a huge fan of This is Spinal Tap (a Rob Reiner film starring much of the same cast including Christopher Guest).  With that in mind, I wasn't sure that I would be a big fan of the mockumentary genre.  But, I keep hearing that Best In Show is a great movie.  I finally gave it a shot (as much to see the dogs as it was to see the movie).Best in Show is a mockumentary (a fictional documentary) about a dog show.  We are introduced to the characters as we would in a documentary.  They give interviews talking about who they are, who their dogs are, and about their goals for the dog show (naturally, everyone expects to win).  Everyone is somewhat neurotic.  The movie stars Parker Posey (Party Girl), Eugene Levy (American Pie), Catherine O'Hara (Waiting for Guffman), and Michael McKean (A Mighty Wind).  While Levy and O'Hara seem to get the most time, nobody is really shorted a time to shine.  One of the fun things about this movie is that it is almost completely improvised all the way through, which makes for some very interesting spots and lines.This is a movie of the absurd.  While I didn't find anything to be rolling on the floor funny, I found so much of the movie to be humorous.  The co-announcer at the dog show had some of the best lines as he just asked question after question and while most of his questions/comments would be inappropriate for an actual dog show, this made it all the funnier.  Another highlight for me was Parker Posey.  The movie was filled with interesting characters, each with a different take on the dog show.  I don't think this will be one of my favorite films, but it is definitely a good one, and a funny movie.",Best in Show
48059,"This film, in my opinion, is a staggering achievement--the saga of Apollo 13, the first time an American spacecraft was in real danger of destruction.  The most impressive thing about this film is the fact that almost the entire storyline is absolutely authentic.  The skill and bravery (and honest fears) of the crew, the ingenuity of the NASA ground support team, the events as portrayed in the movie--all of this is what actually happened.  For once Hollywood manages to almost completely avoid tampering with the facts--this is said to be the influence of Tom Hanks, who is a space enthusiast; Hanks believed (correctly!) that the actual story contained more than sufficient drama.  The movie moves at a quick pace, never drags, and the end packs an emotional wallop that I personally found to be unforgettable.  I saw this film when it first came out, and just revisited it on DVD.  The impact is the same--this is a powerfully told story about a great event and a great success of courage and technological prowess.I like Tom Hanks as an actor, and this is the best performance by him that I can recall seeing.  He simply becomes his character, Astronaut Lovell--he plays the part to utter perfection.  The supporting cast is equally good and all turn in superb performances.  This is a great and classic film that will leave few viewers untouched.  The DVD audio and video are crisp and clean, and this DVD belongs in every library collection.",N/A
562123,"When we have first-rate actors such as Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman in a movie, we expected nothing but the best.  Compounded by this interrogation-style movie, we expected to have a treat.  In many ways, this movie meant to do well with a great location such as Puerto Rico, the female star in the form of Monica Belluchi (who found fame in an Italian movie, &amp; also as a beau to Bruce Willis), &amp; not to mention a director, Stephen Hopkins who gave us &quot;The Ghost &amp; The Darkness&quot;, starring Michael Douglas &amp; Val Kilmer.  Sad to say that I was disappointed with the outcome &amp; it was quite akin to &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;, a dud starred Nicholas Cage &amp; Gary Sinise.  The interrogation was constant in a room, &amp; there were flashbacks from those three main characters.  Camera tricks were used to make it interesting but the premise of this movie was so thin &amp; that after two hours, we couldn't help it but exhausted by the ordeal.  This movie explored also the strained relationships between Gene Hackman's character &amp; his wife, &amp; also testing the friendships between Gene's character &amp; Morgan's character.  Anyhow, to have those two as executive producers as well, they really missed the target by a wide margin.  No wonder this movie went straight to the video market.

583164,"Les Huguenots, transported into divided Berlin, given by DeutscheOper rejuvenates the now almost unfairly forgotten opera. This production is very original, emotionally involving and with a tremendous shock value about thecruelty and barbarism of men. In contrast, some parts are rather lighthearted and comic (eg. the bathing scene, or the duet between Raoul and theQueen) which makes the progress of the work even more disturbingand tragic. The Hungarian born Soltesz has an authoritative grip,a thorough knowledge of the score an keeps the opera movinglike a steam roller. The fourth and fifth acts will blow you away! The singers are very competent. They were selected for looks and acting ability as well as voice. Angela Denning has comic talent and makes her aria come off very well.Lucy Peacock, the tragic heroine, is unforgettable.The American tenor Richard Leech, who established his reputation in this role as Raoul, sings and acts marvelously in spite of the tremendous demands of the role.To sum up: Great theater, very memorable and enjoyable. Highly recommended!Having said all that and after watching the Australian DVD which is to all intents and purposes complete, I must say that this production is severely cut.The main problem is leaving out most of the 3rd act where a great deal of action takes place and without it we lose the dramatic continuity. The 3rd act also contains a wonderful ballet, one of Meyerbeer's specialties. Even so, I'll still prefer the German production for the reasons mentioned earlier.",N/A
604900,At this point it is well known that the Star Trek series is directed at fans only.  Just as Enterprise is slowly going down the tubes along with every other Sci-Fi TV show out there this film was not well recieved.  However despite that problem the movie is actually pretty good and is a good way to end the NExt Generation Saga.The story here is that Riker and Troy have finally gotten married.  Before they leave on their honeymoon (and Riker to his new Ship) the Enterprise makes a detuer to a planet with a strange anomally.  After a brief exploration (in a Jeep like vehicle) they discover another Android similar to Data.  They take it aboard and it ends up being a Proto-type.  Meanwhile a group of rebeliouse ROmulans are planning an attack on Earth lead by a clone of Picard.  What then ensues is that they battle to the death with a sacrafice that not even I saw coming.Overall this movie is for fans of the NExt Generation who have stuck with it through all these years.  This is the final film and it did end with some style.,Star Trek: Nemesis
747591,"The co-produced USA Studios and Univerals productions of Hercules: TLJ and Xena: WP will forever be known as cheese-fests, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  The cheese factor in both of these series is what actually makes them both entertaining and fun to watch.  If it's not Xena's screeching battle-cry or Herc's absolutley ridiculous (and not funny) jokes, it's the over-the-top fight scenes and the fight of good over evil that makes these series an absolute joy to watch.Another aspect to these series that always attracted me to them was the half-way decent wardrobe department.  The costumes that both the good guys (and civilians) and the bad guys wore were always fairly attractive and well suited (no pun intended) for the job.  The armor costumes for the bad guys and creatures were always a high point for me.  Nothing like a tall warlord dressed in a half bronze and leather strap armor set.  Take for instance Xena's second in command who later turns against her.  Great costume.But anyway, how's the DVD set?  The DVD set although a bit over spaced, IMO, (they could have fit the entire set onto 6 DVDs rather than 7), is a much better presentation than the first season set of Xena that came out earlier this year.  However, that's due to the different film stocks used during the filming of these two series.  Hercules was always filmed with 35mm film which tranfers fairly well to DVD.  However the first two seasons (I think, but I may be wrong) of Xena were filmed on 16mm film and as you may guess, doesn't transfer well to DVD.  And so the quality sometimes struggles to stay above VHS quality.  But the Hercules set stays well within fullscreen DVD standards for a TV series at least.  So you have nothing to worry about here for picture quality.The sound quality is on par with the Xena set.  Remastered in 5.1 Surround, the LFE channel is used quite extensively with the music track and quite a bit for special effects.  The surrounds bring in a subtle surround presense with environmental effects and music.The content itself?  This set includes the first 5 Action-Pack movies that basically set up the series and introduces a few of the main characters along with the 13 episodes that make up the short but well rounded first season.  These 13 episodes include what is known as the ""Xena Trilogy"" which introduces the character Xena and how she turns her life of murdererous warrior-ness around to befriending Hercules and fighting for the forces of good against those of the like she was once apart of.Lucy Lawless co-stars in a couple other roles before she takes the character of Xena.  Rene O'Conner also co-stars in one of the movies in some other role, but basically plays the same character-type as Gabrielle.Overall, I'm pleased with this set and look forward for the rest of Anchor Bays' releases of Hercules and Xena.",N/A

143711,"The 18th Bond entry doesn't have quite the invigorated feel of Goldeneye but still manages to thrill. The plot is a bit contrived (but aren't all Bond films)with a villan that isn't as threatening as others because he doesn't do much in the way of his own dirty deeds. Still, it's an interesting comment on the globalization of the media when the bad guy can be a Rupert Murdoch type zillonaire.Tomorrow works best when Brosnan and co-star Michelle Yeoh are on screen together. While they don't always boast the best chemistry, their stunt and action sequences together are quite dazzling. Bond fits Brosnan like a well tailored suit in his second appearence. He inhabits the role and makes it his own. There isn't quite as much depth or angst evident in the bulk of the film to compare to meeting his ex-lover (Terri Hatcher), his discovery of her fate and his own execution of ""The Doctor"".The commentary by director Roger Spottiswoode wasn't half as interesting to me as that provided by the second unit crew. Spottiswoode shows that he does have a knack for action films which is surprising given his background as a director of character driven films. That background, though, comes to the fore during several important scenes and his ease with the actors is evident by the performances turned in by Jonathan Pryce.The stunts are dazzling particularly the impossible one pulled off when Yeoh and Bronsnan must leap from the top of a skyscraper. Their ingenius (and highly unlikely) solution to escape works due to deft editing and photography. Although not the best of the Brosnan Bonds (and, yes, it's going to be just as hard to replace him as it was Connery), it has its moments.",N/A
177455,"This is a wonderful show, one of my favorite SCI FI shows and easily one of the best Sci Fi shows on TV. The producers took an interesting movie and developed the premise into a thoroughly engrossing, unexpected and exciting galactic society, full of twists and turns and political in-fighting and inventive alien foes. The plots are unusual and creative, the characters are constantly developing over the course of the series and the action is excellent. [They don't fall into the clich&eacute; of the lead male character having a girl on every world or ship or anywhere else, either, which is refreshing.] It has now been renewed for a seventh season, and since Sci Fi shows somehow last only seven seasons (witness The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager) I can only wish that MGM would get the rest of the seasons out on DVD asap! -and  give a greenlight to the  movie.

Take a swarthy group of Vikings on the quest for a giant golden bell, a dangerous sea journey, an army of Moors to battle, a ruthless King, and a fiendishly unusual device, ""The Steel Mare"", to kill a man and you have a classic.It has great scenery, sets, costumes, music, and the cast does a great job of hamming it up. Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier are perfect. You can tell they all had fun doing this movie. Though we don't get to see some carnage such as the results of riding the Mare, who needs to, my imagination works fine thank you. Quite honestly the in your face gratuitous gore of many other movies is overrated. When you think about it there are few movies about Vikings, and of those you definitely want to add this to your collection. The whole family should get a kick out of this one.You will be humming the theme song after the movie, and may find yourself swinging pillows at one another seeing imaginary Moors.

353930,"City of Death is distinguished from the other Tom Baker Who episodes by virtue of two things: 1) it is essentially a comedy, rather than a campy drama with strong tongue-in-cheek humor (like most Who episodes) and 2) there is a definite, quasi-romantic vibe going between Tom Baker and his wife (and ex-wife) to be, Lala Ward. Maybe it was the Paris setting; maybe Tom and Lala were so ga-ga for each other at this point they couldn't hide it; but I can't recall any episode with any female companion where the relationship seems quite so intimate. These two factors make ""City"" a bit of a departure from the norm. I am not as enamored of this episode as many fans are, but it is still very enjoyable. On the downside, I found the long travelogue shots of Paris to be a bit boring and time-consuming, the actor who plays Professor Kirinsky to be a giant ham, and some of the plot elements to be absurd beyond the usual level of absurdity (no one in that cafe seems to care about the goons who keep coming in to stick up the Doctor at gunpoint). Those are, however, pretty weak criticisms. On the plus side, Baker, who was beginning to flag a bit in his enthusiasm for the role at this point in his seven-year run, clearly had a ball with the fast-paced, completely comedic script. His biggest strength as an actor was always his ability to recognize when a plot moment or bit of dialogue was ridiculous, and then use humor to make it fly. In this episode he gets plenty of chances and clearly enjoyed all of them. The Duggan character was hackneyed (nice trenchcoat) but also quite funny as a sort of male Leela who is not terribly bright but terribly keen on breaking things and punching people in the face. His interplay with the Doctor is very good (""Duggan, if you do that again I am going to take very severe measures with you."" ""Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?"" ""I'm going to ask you not to do it again.""), and he works equally well with Romana. Skaroth's polite, homicidal butler is also a huge kick (""Kill those two fools please, Harold,"" says Skarroth. ""With pleasure, sir,"" replies the butler). The brass ring however goes to Julian Glover as Skarroth/Count Scarleoni, who sci-fi fans will always remember as General Veers in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", one of the fortunate imperial officers who Vader does not strangle for ineptitude. Glover has beautifully campy dialogue and he plays it out with relish as a profoundly evil villain who never loses his sense of whimsy or humor (""This is going to be a treat. Please remain here while I bring the instruments of torture."") even when he has to wear the disgusting Jaggeroth costume. The plot seemed thin and somewhat confusing at times as it goes along, but everything ties in very nicely at the end....except for the fact that for such a warlike race, the Jaggeroth don't seem to be able to take a punch very well. I guess that's why they're extinct. Anyway, while I don't regard ""City of Death"" as a classic, it remains a must-have for the true fan's collection.",Doctor Who - City of Death VHS

714512,"Nia Vardalos is a veteran comedienne from the Second City group in Chicago.  This film is a catharsis of sorts, as only a gifted comedienne can present: growing up as one of the few Greek girls in Winnepeg, surrounded by blonde Anglos and Ukrainians, she undoubtedly felt left out and turned to comedy to be accepted.This film is beautifully performed and written.  Vardalos herself plays the heroine, Toula, who is painfully shy and somewhat downtrodden, living in the shadow of an older, &quot;perfect sister.&quot;  When she decides to make something of herself - by going to college and specialising in &quot;Computers in the Travel Industry,&quot; she is noticed by a typical white-bread American, Ian Miller.  The movie follows their courtship with special emphasis on the contrast between Toula's Greek and Ian's WASP families.  Of course, since this is a comedy, everything is exaggerated - Ian's parents are stiff and reserved to a fault, while Toula's house is filled with 50 relatives at any given time.  There is also some fun inter-generational humour, as Toula (and her brother) try to break free of the old-world mold of their parents.  Some of the funniest moments are Toula's father lamenting that her over-education led her astray (i.e. into the arms of a non-Greek).Although such a description implies there is an undercurrent of racism (or, at least, ethnic chauvenism), the movie is never mean-spirited.  In fact, it's almost naive in its good-naturedness, in that everyone ends up getting along and the two families come together wonderfully.  If only real life were as life-affirming as this film!  It is family film in that it is funny, warm-hearted, and contains no unsuitable material, although I suspect younger children will find the plot boring and not get most of the jokes.Unfortunately, this DVD version is not up to the standards of the film.  The commentary, mostly by Vardalos, is interesting and points out a number of true-to-life events that were incorporated into the film, in addition to pointing out various friends and family members that appear in the film.  However, there are no cut scenes, no documentaries, etc.  Worse still, there are something like 7 ads for other movies at the beginning of the film, that you have to manually skip - this is a sure-fire way to anger your audience before the film even starts.

740113,"The first movie, #1, had a lot of obstacles to overcome. First, the OVERWHELMING pressure and expectations that were set on it. It, for the most part, past that. It had to introduce hundreds of thousands of people to this wizarding world, and it's hero, Harry Potter, and that took nearly an hour out of its running time. Those were just a few of the many obstacles the Sorcerer's Stone HAD to overcome.Well, in Chamber of Secrets, people now know the story of HarryPotter, have lowered (a bit) there expectations, and the entire cast and crew is back with a LOT more experience. All of these advantages over #1 should make this a better movie, right?Thankfully, it WAS. Here's what I thought of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets:1) Plot: This movie follows the second book in J.K. Rowling's recored-selling book series, and follows Harry throug his second year at Hogwarts. While many have said that this was the worst book of the series, and because of that this might turn out to be the worst movie of the series. I highly disagree! We start out with Harry, back at the Dursleys for the summer...here we go again. They treat him like...a criminal, work him to death, and dont allow him to say the ""M word"" (magic) AT ALL IN THIS HOUSEHOLD!!! Well, one night, when Harry is in his room, a house-elf, named Dobby, visits Harry. He warns of GRAVE DANGER at Hogwarts, horrible things planned for the following school year! What is this elf talking about? Harry ignores the elf, and goes to school anyway. Everything seems to be going normally (or whatever you would call ""normal"" at Hogwarts) when Harry finds a cat, Mrs. Norris, hanging upside down...petrified in a hallway. And above, written in what looks like blood, are written the words ""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened."" What's going on??? No one knows, and within a few weeks, more people have been petrified by an un-known creature. That's when Harry remembers Dobby's comments, that something terrible would be happening that year at Hogwarts...2) Acting: HUGE improvement. Amazing the difference a year makes...at least for the cast of Harry Potter. There is so much more emotion, drama, suspense. For example, last year, there were perhaps 2 or 3 confrentation with Malfoy the whole movie. In Chamber of Secrets, they really clash! There are wizarding duels, TONS OF QUIDDITCH!, a lot more emphasis on Harry and his friends, etc... Bonds are really made here, and some of the best scenes are when Malfoy's father (a Voldemort supporter) and Ron' s dad (a true wizard) talk... Hermione, Ron, Harry, and the rest of Gryffindor really seem to come together. There is real emotion as well when they defend each other, *example: Malfoy calling Hermione a ""mudblood"", everyone from both Gryffindor and Slytherin yelling and trying to get a piece of the other! Hermione's tears after the insult, Ron and Harry's support. The entire school welcoming Hagrid back toward the end, everyone cheering Harry on after the Quidditch game, etc... And the actor who played Gildera Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) did a SUPERB job! He was holarious, loved to show off his teeth and get attention, and really played the clueless part well too! The whole movie had some humor in it as well that was lacked in the first one, and it was little things like Kenneth Branagh's GREAT acting and sense of humor that made this one better than the first.There is a lot more dark acting here too. Voldemort is brought to life in a scary way, and seeing all the petrified people, Harry hearing voices in the wall that NO ONE else can here. Tom Riddle's Hermione like brilliance, all the mystery, suspense, and those spiders...and that snake. All of the acting combining with a suspeneseful story made this a better movie then the last.3) Graphics: Another huge improvement. Hogwarts, while see mingconfined in the first movie, seems to come alive in this. You learn about the whomping willow, go a lot DEEPER into the forbidden forest, and see those....horrible spiders. The snake, the blood, the Quidditch game(s) (brought together a LOT better than in the Sorcerer's stone. A lot more action!). Even the blood and the big fight against Voldemort is all very exciting....thanks to the graphics. You really feel a lot more like your seeing Hogwarts the way J.K. Rowling saw it. It feels real, not like it came off of a computer program. That helped capture the feeling, and continue the magical flame the first one lit!4) Problems: It seems like they often go for ALL of the big things, and don't try to ease you in to regular life at Hogwarts. And while this was a great movie, and nearly flawless in a lot of ways, it still lacked that and could still use something. The main problem right now, in my opinion, is the fact that they go for the BIG things. When I read the books, I felt (feel) like I was attending Hogwarts myself, reading about all of the homework and going to all of the classes and Quidditch practice every night and eating breakfast and discussing tactics with Ron in the morning. They seemedto have still missed that for the most part here. *(They also left a few things out: Deathday Party for example)*Overall, this is a GREAT movie. It has a lot of action, GREATgraphics, and superb acting in a lot of ways. It's still not perfect, but I think that by the third movie, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" (set to be released June 2004 as last reported) we may have a 5-star series !

268863,"I am writing this pre-review to express my Great Expectations and excitement over the upcoming DVD release of the 14 Sherlock Holmes movies made by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.For those of us who have loved and worn out our VHS versions of these films, I am sure that I speak for many of us in expressing incredible anticipation and near shock that someone has finally recognized the need to release a ""restored version"" of these timeless classics.We are told that they have been ""Preserved and restored in 35mm by the UCLA Film and Television Archive."" This is marvelous and I have already pre-ordered Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 from MPI Home Video.I so hope that the entire 14 movies, are ultimately released in restored condition. Especially the rarest of them, ""The Scarlet Claw"" which has rarely been shown on televison and only been available on VHS sporadically.To me and many others I know, Basil Rathbone is the definative Holmes. Not just because he looks alarmingly similar -as much as is humanly possible- to Sidney Pagets drawings of Holmes from the Strand Magazine illustrations, but mostly we love Rathbone because he portrayed the same Holmes that we as readers get through the buffer of Dr. Watson explaining away not magnifying Holmes' shortcomings.Jeremy Brett chose to amplify every negative aspect of Holmes' personality that in the written versions Watson explained away. Rathbone's Holmes has been demeaned visciously over the past years and hopefully the respect and dignity that he gave his portrayals will be seen in all their accuracy and glory with these new digitally restored releases. ... these will have to be the best quality versions of these classics ever released...so for all of us who have cursed the incomprehensibly awful releases of these films over the years...our time has almost come. Show your support for this effort by ordering a restored version of American Film Histroy.Much Thanks to UCLA, MPI, and Whoever was ultimately responsible for the idea of doing this!!!!",Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror VHS
397758,"I've seen my share of films that have been good and bad. I've also seen movies that could similar to others. When it comes to The Ninth Configuration, I now know that there can be films that are original and don't borrow from other sources. This movie is not only one of a kind, it is also very moving and philosophical. If not dramatic with some twists and turns. Even the scene involving a bar room brawl between Stacy Keach and various actors playing vicious bikers (who literally get their tail-ends kicked brutally and fatally by Keach)was very original, if not unique.The Ninth Configuration examines the after effects of the Vietnam War on various veterans who have suffered from post traumatic stress syndrome and other various traumas. It also examines the various themes of religion and why the world itself is going to hell in a handbasket. It also points out the old question that many have often asked. Is there a God? And if so, why does he let evil get away with various things?A cult-classic like Blade Runner, with elements of witty black comedy that are almost like those from the movie M*A*S*H, The Ninth Configuration is a moving drama and excellent masterpiece. Not only does it have solid acting from the likes of Stacy Keach, Scott Wilson (who won a Golden Globe for his role in the film), Ed Flanders, Steve Sandor, Richard Lynch, the late Joe Spinell, Will Luckling, Robert Loggia, Jason Miller (as a soldier directing Shakespearean plays with Dogs, a very original and enjoyable plot element), Moses Gunn, and Tom Atkins, it also has some very interesting and powerful moments. Especially the surreal scene where a NASA astronaut discovers THE crucifix on the surface of the Moon.If you enjoy films that are original and touches upon serious themes, like faith and religion, and state of humanity, then you are in for a surprise when you view The Ninth Configuration. It is a movie that still entertains many, and still keeps asking the same questions that man is still seeking the answers to.",Ninth Configuration VHS
693897,"First, let me say some positives about this DVD:The image and sound quality are amazing.  This DVD is probably the best quality DVD to date.  Great for showing off a high quality home theater.  Since the movie was shot on digital film, there was almost no ghosting or image quality lost.Now the negatives:What made the original Star Wars movies so spectatular was their campy dialog, fake but realistic special effects (even though you knew it was a fake spaceship you still knew it was a picture of a real model).  The older Star Wars films were mostly a tribute to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's.  A true space opera, they were classics.Episode II relies mostly on the impressive special effects to mesmerize and entertain.  Acting and story are second to this.  The totally cardboard acting of Haeden Christianson is so bad, that it makes you wonder if he should play an emotionally repressed andriod instead of the future Darth Vader. It made me miss Jar Jar.Oustanding special effects that circumvent the rest of the movie.  This movie seems to be made mostly just to fill a quota and to set up the clearly superior episodes 3-6.  Makes you sad to see a performer past his prime, and Star Wars is way past its prime.",N/A

The only reason I'm only giving it 4 instead of 5 is that FD2 is superior in every way...but please NOTE: You must watch #1 to get background information on many charcters and events before seeing #2.

199365,"Yes, please excuse the cheesy title, but my sisters made me watch this when I was really, really young, and whether its nostalgia or fun music or fun plot points, I love this movie.  You can find synopses anywhere online, so I will endeavor just to give an opinion.  This film was definitely made to show off Julie Andrews.  She has pretty much every single song in the show, and while I would like for the other characters to have more singing opportunity, what we have is terribly fun.  The &quot;Tapioca&quot; is a definite highlight as is &quot;Jazz Baby.&quot;  Everyone will agree that the title song is fantastic, but I think where I may be alone is when I say that my among favorite moments in the show is &quot;Trinkt le Chaim.&quot;  I admit that it has little purpose other than to show off Julie Andrews's voice (if you know of another reason, please tell me)  but the scene is lots of fun nevertheless.The reason I give this DVD a 4-star rating is because there are no special features.  I have grown quite accustomed to special features and frequently use them as a way to prioritize movies that are on my wish list.  My affection for this movie should be pretty evident in that I purchased the film without any of my beloved special features.  The movie alone is definitely worth having.If you like, you can also blame the four stars on the racism.  This movie definitely displays none of the sensitivities that we've grown accustomed to over the years.  Definitely, if you are offended by things like the treatment of Asians in movies that predate political correctness, then you won't like this movie at all.  However, if you can allow yourself to enjoy the film in spite of the Asian treatment, then you should enjoy this film.You should also not expect for philosophical discussions to follow a viewing of this film.  Just a contented sigh and lots of joy for whatever activity you plan after this movie.",N/A
727702,"While never quite as bad as an Alpha or Madacy DVD, Retromedia's titles usually seem to underwhelm for one reason or another (their Faceless Monster transfer is a disastrous must-to-avoid!!). In this case, it's not the movie's fault. The Manster, while hardly a great film, is a perennial sleaze/horror favorite, particularly, it seems, of anyone who was creeped-out by it as a kid on some late-night horror show. The wonderfully nauseating pre-credit sequence sets the tone, as a hairy monster attacks bathing geishas, splattering the rice paper divider with blood. In his mountaintop laboratory, the quite mad Dr. Suzuki keeps his hideously disfigured, slobbering wife Emiko in a cage, and is forced to shoot his ape-like mutant brother Kenji, an ""experiment that didn't work out."" These opening scenes establish a lurid, unwholesome atmosphere that blankets the entire movie like a sickening cloud. Happily married, responsible foreign correspondent Larry Stanford (Peter Dyneley) arrives to interview Dr. Suzuki, who inoculates him with an experimental serum. Larry immediately goes off the deep end: he stops shaving, starts drinking to excess, acting surly, neglecting his job, and lounging around in hot mineral baths with Dr. Suzuki, his secretary Tara, and a bevy of fetching geisha girls (a scene played for Dean Martin-ish double entendres). Larry starts feeling a strange pain in his shoulder, hair periodically grows on his hand, and his wife shows up to collect him, only to find him hot and heavy with Tara. There is an actually quite effective scene where Larry visits a temple filled with scary demon statues and kills a singing monk. Sliding further downhill, he starts hanging around in the street, randomly assaulting stray women, while back at the lab Dr. Suzuki traces Larry's metamorphosis on a line graph. Finally we get the infamous, unforgettable scene where Larry discovers an eye growing out of his shoulder, which quickly matures into a second head that looks like one of those carved coconuts you see in souvenir shops. The rapidly mutating ""manster"" arrives at the lab, kills Dr. Suzuki, grabs Tara, and heads toward the active volcano crater at the top of the mountain. I won't ruin the climax; suffice to say it was a real wow when we were monster-crazed adolescents, but packs a bit less punch today. The Manster is a bit serious, perhaps even dry, in tone for a C-movie of its type (some reviewers have suggested a fairly convincing psychosexual subtext), but moves along at a brisk pace, and offers some of the earliest instances of overtly twisted, ""gross-out"" imagery in a genre that was at the time still heavily dependent on goofy rubber monsters and wholesome heros and heroines. A proto-sleaze mini-classic, prefiguring the full-blown gore movies of just a couple of years later, but enjoyable on a camp level as well.While this DVD definitely qualifies as ""good enough for now,"" it leaves me feeling like there's still a better version possible (there was an official United Artists laserdisc edition years ago). The good news is that the source print shows very little damage, only some light speckling/blemishing, and the tonal values, brightness, and contrast are generally very good to excellent. But many scenes look a bit washed-out and lacking in highlight detail, especially in comparison to my VHS copies (which are admittedly both rather dark), and the overall image suffers slightly from a grainy, dupey look. Essentially a decent transfer of a pretty clean 16mm TV print. Not terrible by any means, but not as crisp and detailed as we're getting used to (spoiled?) with DVD, and not what I'd consider a definitive, must-have release. Maybe I'm too picky; if you just want to re-live the Nightmare Theatre experience, this will probably do fine. The only extras are six chapter stops and a still ""gallery"" consisting of four B&W; glossies and an ad mat. At least there's no annoying ""Drive-In Madness"" featurette. I haven't seen Alpha's DVD edition, but would assume it's worse. Haven't seen Sinister Cinema's DVD-R, either, but would assume it's at least this good or better. As they say, you get what you pay for. All in all, OK for the price, but not a definitive, never-need-to-upgrade edition.",The Manster
724747,"Thank god they released this on DVD, my VHS tape was wearing out, and sadly the box was crushed over the 7 or so years I've had it. This DVD is worth getting if you love the pumpkins from the early years (Gish-Siamese Era), which yes, I DO LOVE! You get to see an awesome acoustic version of ""Cherub Rock"", nessled against a hard rock full distortion version of one of the pumpkins biggest hits ""Disarm"" on UK TV, in full trippy british tv color! Other hilights include ""I Am One"" live in Spain, where Billy goes on a full out rant ""GIMME GIMME GIMME GET GET NOTHING"", and my favorite is ""Slunk"" on Japanese tv from 1992 - the band jokes around with the Japanese hosts, then busts out in full out RAWK power with Slunk. Nothing but raw emotion here. ""Mayonaise"" is another gem, done acoustically outdoors infront of a small crowd, mixed with old and new footage of the band.. its rather touching and one of my favorite moments on the DVD. I also love ""Soma"", which is a beautiful song in and of itself, but to see live.. is just.. amazing. The DVD is better than the VHS version because they tacked on the ""Lost Tapes"" from 1994, which were recorded during the Lollapalooza shows of 1994.  Another favorite part is ""Silverf***"" live in London - which is just a great ending to the DVD... Billy really gets into it and at the end totally destroys Jimmy's drumkit and falls all over the stage. The only drawback on this DVD is that during ""Silverf***"" when Billy sings ""Over the Rainbow"" (I believe it is only in the Lost Tapes section.. it might also be in the verison live in London) the sound cuts out, because I guess the band didn't have the rights to the song to have it reproduced on the DVD.. which is kind of crappy because you know what he's saying anyway. A great DVD for any pumpkins fan, this is still my favorite era of the band, they were young, with such raw emotion and so much to say, I'll always love the Pumpkins but this is just the best.OH- and of course this DVD captures the band's quirky and funny spirit with ""therapy sessions""- which features Jimmy (and other bandmates) working out his frustrations by talking to.. a porcelain duck!

The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, &amp; Weird Science have just been re-released on DVD in remastered style after very disappointing DVD transfers in the late 90's.The Renunion collection allows purchasers the chance to buy all three DVD's in a package deal.  It makes sense to do this because it is cheaper than buying them separately.  In fact, you practically get one for free!  A friend of mine bought the package as soon as it was released.  I think it will sell out, so hop to it!Each title has been remastered although they are not perfect.  Still, considering the age of these films, they look very pleasing.All three are now 16:9 enhanced which is a blessing, no more large black bars top and bottom which plagued the 1998 DVD of &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; (for example).Even better news for purists, is that the original soundtracks have been reinstated into the films. This is denoted on each separate cover, and is an important factor.  for too long we have had to put up with altered soundtracks. Sixteen Candles soundtrack was butchered so bad that the film lost its spark.  Well no more with this release.The DVD's boast a DTS soundtrack for each movie.  Sorry, but it's nothing to write home about!  In the case of &quot;Breakfast Club&quot;, the opening song &quot;Don't you forget about me&quot; still sounds very lame and mono as it did on the previous DVD release!

Sorry to report that Universal have decided not to include extras on any on any of the dics (except for trailers).  This is a shame because this is what DVD's are all about.  I can only assume that this is because DTS soundtracks take up considerable disc space.  What I would have liked is some deleted scenes or alternate scenes which do exist. For example, the TV version of &quot;breakfast Club&quot; is different to the DVD version, it contains several different scenes. Overall, there was approximately 4 hours of footage taken from Breakfast Club so to get some of this as an added special feature would have been nice Universal!!!  There are also alternate scenes out there for &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; but you dont get to see them on this DVD.Despite these let-downs, you must order this package deal because it's the best the films have looked in a long time.

371095,"""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", has gotten a bad press over the years since it's unsuccessful release in 1938 and certainly it is one of the lesser efforts of Director Ernst Lubitsch and of both Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper. There are however things of merit in this film that shouldn't be dismissed . While it might lack a lot of the energy and witty lines that are in abundance in Colbert's classic ""Midnight"", and Lubitsch's magnificent ""Ninotchka"", of the following year the film boasts a superlative cast, glamourous settings, sophisticated goings on and a smart snappy pace that keeps the action moving. No classic, it is still good cinema art of the Golden Era of Hollywood.Based loosely on an old Gloria Swanson vechicle of the same name from the 1920's, the story scripted by Billy Wilder has been necessarily  updated to the closing period of the depression era and tells the story of well heeled individuals, or those wishing to be well heeled playing out marital games in a glamourous setting so popular with a viewing audience slowly recovering from the viscitudes of the stark depression years of the early 30's. Central to the story is wealthy American playboy Michael Brandon visiting the Riviera who becomes instantly besotted with the young and attractive Nicole de Loiselle (Claudette Colbert) in a department store where an argument develops over Michael's desire to purchase only the tops of a pair of Pajamas. After agreeing to buy the bottoms for her father Nicole, who is a refined Gold Digger out for a solution to her's and her father's (the eternally perplexed  Edward Everett Horton in another great performance), money troubles finds herself with an ardent suitor in the wealthy American who initially hides the fact from her that he has been married seven times before! After this startling piece of information is revealed to her at the engagement party photographic session Nicole decides to play the same game herself and promises to marry Michael only if considering his track record, he will give her a large sum of money in the divorce settlement. After the marriage takes place Nicole attempts by living a seperate life and refusing the playboy's romantic advances (in one very funny scene by chewing on some onion sticks over his shoulder just before he kisses her!)to prod him into a divorce which he finally agrees to after a mental breakdown. By this time Nicole has her own money and begins to see that Michael is actuallly the man for her and attempts to win him back through staging scenes to provoke his jealousy till the romantic conclusion when all is settled.Romantic sophisticated comedy it certainly is with just an edge of malice thrown in, and it makes for some funny hijinks by the cast and an entertaining although not top grade romp that will keep you amused. Much talk has been spent on the correctness of the casting with good reason. Claudette Colbert is her usual  best in this type of a role, even in the scenes where her character is playing around with Michael's mind. She had that way of making marital comedy seem so effortless and her own glamourous Parisian appearance and manner suited her perfectly for roles set in the world of the rich and priveledged. Gary Cooper is the bone of contention for most viewers of this film and certainly he does not look comfortable in the role of the Millionaire playboy who just can't help himself in  marrying too many times. The role definately called for an actor who has a more sophisticated screen persona like Cary Grant. Cooper tries hard and his work with Claudette is the best part of the film but I always think of the better choices that were available at this time to do this role. The supporting cast as in all Lubitsch productions is first rate starting with the befuddled Edward Everett Horton as the roguish and financially strapped  Marquis de Loiselle, Nicole's father who is desperate to get Nicole and Michael married so he can enjoy the rich bounty that would flow from such a marriage. His scenes of trying to pass off a questionable ""antique"" bath tub supposedly belonging to Louis Fourteenth to Micheal is most amusing and Horton's famed double takes are much in evidence here in this story. A young David Niven in one of his earliest roles plays Albert De Regniera, a friend of Nicole's who is equally short of money and is mistaken by Michael as an unwelcome suitor in one of the climatic scenes towards the end of the film where he scores a punch to the jaw from Nicole to raise Michael's jealousy of her other ""suitors"".""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", is a pleasant way to pass an hour and a half dallying with the problems of beautiful, wealthy people and those who wish to be that way by hook or by crook. A lesser effort by Lubitsch certainly but lesser for him is still enjoyable. Despite the miscasting of Gary Cooper in the urbane type of role that was not really his speciality, any film with Claudette Colbert is worth a look and her comedy playing in ""Bluebeard"", tends to mask some of the lack of confidence in Cooper's playing. For a journey back to 1930's sophistication and marital goings on, ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", is an enjoyable minor comedy to have a laugh with.",Bluebeard's Eighth Wife VHS

What I mean by that is tha WWE put in some new faces and new storylines to see if they work.In some areas they did well in some areas but failed in others.The good matches on the card was Brock Lesnar vs John Cena. I have always been impressed with Cena's wrestling ability and I'm glad to see him get a push even if the gimmick's a little lame. The match wasn't quite as good as the Angle/Lesnar match at WrestleMania but they still worked well together. Kane/RVD vs The Dudleys was a good match as well and with Cheif Morley as the special guest referee made it more entertaining to watch. Morley tried to screw RVD and Kane but it backfired and even got the 3-D from the Dudleys for his troubles. Bubba Ray received a chokeslam and the 5 star frog splash after the 3-D. The six man tag was decent. Everyone did get some quality wrestling time in the match. Nash looked like he has cleared up some ring rust and Flair put up a decent performance for someone who hasn't competed in a ppv since October. But the match could've been better. Los Guerreros vs Team Angle wasn't that great of a match but on an entertainment value, it was good. Guerreros lived up to their family motto and that is lying, cheating, and stealing as they making more illegal tags than I could keep count. Team Angle won when Haas pinned Chavo and Benjamin held on to his legs. Team Angle came out to a portrait of Kurt with gold medals in honor of Kurt during his neck surgery.

774180,"When a series is progressing predictably, one of the things a director must struggle with is finding new ways to bring about a satisfactory conclusion.  We have known all along that a strong inner conflict was developing between the three 'saplings of the Soldats - Kirika, Mirielle, and Chloe.  Nor is it any surprise that it would come to a head violently.  Yet withing this thematic architecture there is quite a lot of room for plot manipulations and character development, and director Kouichi Mashimo seizes the opportunity to leave not stone unturned.Kirika has returned to the spiritual home of the Soldats, coupled with Chloe for the final rituals that will refine them into Noir, the deadly assassin sisterhood of the Soldats,  Cloaked as if they were nuns, Altena and her consorts prepare the final tests.  The goal in hand is the return of the Soldats to their original character as truthseekers who follow the deadliest path.  Altena's opponents are the new Soldats, who prefer the status quo of ruling a vast financial empire.  The conflicts are inevitable, and all revolve about the three women.Almost as an afterthought Mirielle, who was left behind at the end of the last DVD, reappears.  But this is no afterthought, but the completion of the circle.  Only two can survive the tests, the other must die as a sacrifice.  Will it be Kirika, who has come to be repelled by what she has done.  Or Chloe, who suddenly shows a  surprisingly delicate human side, couched in the frame of the deadliest of killers.  Or perhaps the victim will be Mirielle, abandoned by the Soldats, left behind by Kirika, and fiercely loyal to her truest friend.The theme for these last episodes is 'if love can kill then hate can save,' a question which receives many answers.  Even at the end, we are left to answer this for ourselves.  The series reaches a point where an exquisitely open-ended conclusion is possible and the last dialog leaves the viewer wondering, with Kirika, &quot;What are we going to do now?&quot;  And the only answer is &quot;Go back to Paris and have a hot cup of tea.'",Noir: End of the Matter - Volume 7
519630,"Let's start with the fact that the 'extended' version is a big improvement on what other DVDs try to do with 'deleted' / 'extended' scenes. Instead of having them as an 'extra feature' that is shown separately from the actual film, seeing these scenes in context (as a part of the whole movie) makes them (and the movie) richer, and their nuances much clearer. I can't even complain that the production company hadn't advertised in advance that the extended version would be out a few months after the theatrical one - because they had.Except for the commentaries (which I'll get to in a moment), the extra features are just perfect, and should be an example and an insparation to other films. Instead of the usual behind the scenes &quot;blah blahs&quot; (or &quot;featuretes&quot;) and theatrical trailers, we get a full account of how the movie was created - from the adaption of the book to a script to finding the actors, the work on the film itself (or rather - the films), and so on. This is done so thoroughly that no matter what interests you in the process of making this film, you will easily find it on this DVD set because of the well organized menus.As for the commentaries, the casts' and Peter Jackson and co.'s were the most interesting. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the cast hadn't been given the chance to do it as a group (except for the hobbits, who commented together, and their group dynamics &amp; discussions were fun and interesting). Viggo Mortensen's commentary about Aragorn was also sorely missed.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

I have a VHS copy of the original JAPANESE ONLY release, not shown in the U.S.  That versin is longer, the scenes are in different order and the story takes on a whole new look, focusing more on the characters.  Oh for a DVD of that version!That aside, this is the film by which I judge all 'creature features'.  You forget the monster is a man in a rubber suit, stomping around a miniature set. The black & white photography, the attention to lighting details make this a winner all around.I feel guilty for being sad at the end as Godzilla dies, but that's just how the story pulls you in.

479101,"Ah, now here's a movie. Ilsa, She-Wolf of th SS. A crazy, exploitiong, horror and blood filled movie depicting a Nazi Concentration Camp and it's Commandant, Ilsa.The camp has it's share of inmates both male and female. The men have two functions, manual labor and sexually gratifying Ilsa. Of course if you fail to satisfy Ilsa, you will never again be with another woman as she and her two hot blond nurses turn you into a `half-man' with a snip of the steel. Women serve another purpose, medical experiments. Ilsa is a doctor of sorts trying to prove to the Third Reich Command that women are superior to men. They can withstand more pain which makes them more saveage killers.Among the prisoners are two freaks, one male, one female. The male is an American (of all things) who was studying in Germany's University when the war began. He can control his body until Ilsa (and all her nurses) are satisfied. Because of this his manhood is spared and he becomes a nightly visitor to Ilsa's private quarters.The woman can withstand any pain the Nazi's can dream up. And they can come up with some very perverted, painful, and unusual techniques, most of them involving private and sensitive areas.Yes you can plainly see that this was filmed on the location of Hogan's Heros. Also look for the lesbian guard who likes to hang out with the soldiers and guards. She is popular among the guards by providing female prisoners. Then there is the fat male doctor who seems to have TB or something.Well as always, the prisoners revolt and a decent gunfight ensues. It escalates until the regular German army comes in and blows the place to hell. All the Nazi's are killed, and poor Ilsa ends up tied naked to a bed and has her head blown off by a Nazi officer. That is so that the coming Americans will never know what happened.Good points:Ilsa is HOT, this chick has a killer bod and huge boobs. She even turns on her commanding officer who orders her to pee on him.Ilsa's nurses are both blond and beautiful. Watch them whip two prisoners while they are topless. They beat their prisoners until they can't lift their arms.The female prisoners are a hit or miss. Some are hot, some are cute, some are butt ugly.Bad Points:Watched this movie twenty times. Never found one.",Ilsa - She Wolf of the SS VHS
601809,"It would be a fair assessment by some to label this a garden variety horror picture but it is probably due more credit than that.  Instead of moving too fast too early so you can outguess the plot, the opening scene shows an intriguing series of events that leaves your interest piqued about what lies ahead and holds your attention.Falling away from the standarad locales of haunted houses, cemetaries, etc. of other horror movies, it is nice to see a fresh perspective on an unsettling and unseemingly evil ship.  Somewhat straightforward in the cast getting killed one by one (no surprise there) with twists and turns thrown in, the viewer is thrown for a loop later in the movie that is totally unexpected and adds a nice angle to the whole story. The suspense in the movie is well done and there are good special effects to boot.  Lastly, the ending has a nice reedeming quality too in that it is not what is expected and gives you a good jolt.  So much so that you could almost read a sequel into this first movie.The DVD itself has a couple of good featurettes, a music video, trailer, and cast and crew biographies.  Not a bad deal for the money really.  If you're a horror fan and like a decently developed ghost story plot with good intentions, you'll probably be pleased with this film and I do recommend it to everyone.",N/A

731002,"&quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; is based on Bret Easton Ellis book of the same title, and the fact tells you all; like the previously filmed &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; and &quot;American Psyco&quot; the characters spending time aimlessly in university are not your oridinary clean-cut all-American boys and girls.  But let me hurriedly say that that is not a problem at all here (in fact, not everything about them is repulsive as some critics suggest).The real problem can be found in the name of the director, Roger Avary, who once was working at a local video shop with a film buff called Quention Tarantino.  Unlike his ex-pal, however, Avary's filmic technique are only a showy performance -- split-screen, fast cutting, backward-running shots -- everything is at first mildly funny to see, and then he overuses them.  And we realize that the characters are not well-rounded or interesting in any way (I mean, how many people really care if college students drink so much as the film shows?  We are long past the stage when we are easily shocked by them, living in the time of the internet, you know.)The story is actually a string of loosely connected episodes around drug-dealing (and brother to another Bateman in &quot;American Psycho&quot;) Sean Bateman (James Vab Der Beek) and Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon).  It starts with a party scene where every students got drunk and stoned, and among them we see these two not-quite-happy.  And you are introduced to other characters played by Ian Someholder, Kate Bosworth, and Kip Pardue (though the last two's screen time is fairly short,  Plus you get cameos of Faye Dunnaway and Eric Stoltz.Sean wants to sleep with Lauren, who is in love with another guy.  Sean then sleeps with different girls while Paul Denton (Ian Someholder) is attracted to him.  Every character wants something which they cannot have, and the only thing they can do is &quot;deal with it.&quot;These characters are all shallow and self-centered, but remember, Tarantino has shown many killers in his films and can make them quite engaging and lively presence.  No chance here.  Roger Avary insists on his own &quot;realism&quot; so that Dowson's Creek Van Der Beek must show us how he spends his time in bathroom.  All is done as if saying, &quot;How about that?&quot;  Sorry, but we are not impressed, after watching &quot;Kill Bill&quot; lately.Possibly except for Ms. Sossamon, the acting is of lower kind that would explain why these actors have not achieved higher or bigger level of works after their once memorable performance in career.  They need another agent who has seen Avary's tedious &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; disaster, and can give better advice on their choice of jobs.I do not disagree with the shallow characters -- we may resemble them in some way or other -- but the shallow way of presenting them.  But more fundamental questiuon is the film does not answer the question -- why should we watch this film (which still smells the bubbly 80s) now in the 21st century?",The Rules of Attraction VHS
741273,"""Identity"" is clever, off-the-wall thriller. Plot-wise, it has only one trick up its sleeve, but it's a neat trick that will surprise most people when they see it. Because of this, it's the kind of movie you can ruin for people by giving too much of it away, and I certainly won't do that here.The movie begins with an old cliche. One dark and stormy night, a group of people, most of who don't know each other, find refuge in a run down motel. They are marooned because the rains have flooded the roads. Telephone and radio communications have also been cut off. The group includes a strange man with an injured wife and a creepy young son, a crazy Hollywood star in the company of her chauffeur [John Cusack], a newly married couple and a police detective [Ray Liotta] taking a convicted killer to an appeals hearing. As the night progresses, these people find out they have more in common than they imagine.From the onset, everything seems slightly askew, and everyone seems more than a bit odd. It's like an elongated ""Twilight Zone"" episode. About two-thirds of the way, through, a secret is revealed, and it all begins to make a kind of sense.One of the movie's strongest assets is its cast. Besides lead players Cusack, Liotta and Amanda Peet, the performers include such character actor favorites as Alfred Moline, Clea Duvall, John C. McGinley, William Lee Scott, Jake Busey and Pruitt Taylor Vance.",Identity

753964,"You have to respect director John McTiernan for what he is attempting with Basic: The Thinking Man's Action Film. While at its core, Basic is your run-of-the-mill murder mystery interlaced with testosterone moments of flying bullets and angry stares, in the end the final product becomes bogged down in its own cleverly laid sandtraps. The screenplay, while sharply written with tight dialogue still fails to deliver the knockout punch. The performances are adequate, with Giovanni Ribisi being the lone sell-out in the cast. While attempting to appear sinister, amoral and just plain confused, he comes off as a pure hack; all menacing sidelong glances, guttural ""I hate Daddy"" speeches while sputtering riddle after incoherent riddle. John Travolta imbues Tom Hardy with the same boyish charm and ornery impetus that had littered every character he has every played, and Sam Jackson is merely adequate. Two surprise performances however come in the form of Tim Daly (Wings) and Harry Connick Jr. Not a terrible effort, but Basic could have been better.",N/A
545869,"Poor Laurence Fishburne. I felt so sorry for him watching this movie because he gives a passionate and multi-dimensional  performance as  Othello and yet, no one else in the cast matches or even comes close to his level of talent.As the cover photo suggests, this is a more sexualized version of Shakespeare's tragedy, which doesn't make it bad, but definitely steals the focus from the other emotions that fuel the story. All of Othello's feelings were intense, not just those he had for Desdemona, and this fact is overlooked by the emphasis on his sexuality. Kenneth Braunagh is such a bad Iago that I actually found myself laughing at him. As for Irene Jacob's performance, it is really not worth mentioning here. She is pretty and exotic but she gives no depth to the wounded character of Desdemona.

152577,"James Boyle, the journalist who actually lived this fascinating story, wrote this 1986 screenplay along with Oliver Stone, who also directed it.  It takes place in El Salvador during in the early 1980s.  War was raging and, depending upon which version you believe, it was either a Civil war against the military government or a potential communist takeover.  People are being murdered every day and it's an awful place to be.James Woods stars as James Boyle, a freelance journalist who had formerly been a reporter in Vietnam.  His life in California is spinning out of control.  He has no money, his wife has left him, and he craves the excitement of being where the action is. He and his disk jockey friend, Doctor Rock, played by James Belushi, drive down to El Salvador, drinking and drugging and spinning bad jokes all the way.  At first it all seems like fun.Then reality hits.  And the two friends are plunged into the violence.  There's one scene after another that made me cringe in horror.  And yet, James Woods is quite a con man and keeps getting himself and his friend out of scrapes by his fast talking and former connections. He falls in love with a local woman, tells it like it is to the American Ambassador, and keeps getting into trouble.  There's lots of action and lots of people getting killed.  And yet, it's mainly about the personalities of the two lead characters.  This adds a light touch to the horror that surrounds them.It's a fast paced film without one dull moment.  I couldn't stop watching and wondering what would happen next.  The DVD extras feature a long documentary about the making of the film.  That was interesting background and added to my enjoyment although by then I was dozing off.  During the actual film, however, falling asleep would have been impossible.Highly recommended.",N/A
782223,"Frank Zappa, New York, Halloween ...... Bozzio, Belew, Bickford ....... how many more reasons could a person need to desire this majorly non-boring round thing????The DVD release of Baby Snakes is a cause for celebration, both for long time fans and novices who are just discovering FZ - for the latter in particular, who never got the chance to experience the Zappa performance spectacle.At its core, Baby Snakes is a concert film, but it is also a keen insight into the man's creative mechanism, a free association style that embraced all manner of media in addition to music.  A prime example is the generous screentime given to clay animator Bruce Bickford, with whom Zappa had worked with on a video project for PBS around 1975.  Bickford creates erotic nightmares in clay and on film while Zappa prods him on in metaphorical abandon, the result complimented by jarring sound design created spontaneously by Zappa and his cohorts in the studio.  We also witness FZ rehearsing his bandmates, creating on the spot extraveganzas with Roy Estrada and a gas mask, spying on the backstage cavortings of musicians and crewmates, possibly developing new theories and creative concepts from witnessing the bizarre goings on ......Ultimately, in the course of its 2.75 hours' length, Baby Snakes evolves into a relentless live assault, a labor of love dedicated to the appreciative crowd of New York's finest crazy persons, who are also afforded ample screen time.  We learn the History of the Poodle (God's 3rd mistake), witness a debut performance of &quot;I Have Been In You&quot;, observe monster drummer Terry Ted Bozzio in a Speedo transform himself into the devil for the number &quot;(Mammarian Protuberances) 'N' Beer&quot;, enjoy featured vocal performances by keyboardist Tommy Mars (Pound for a Brown), guest stunt guitarist Adrian Belew (City of Tiny Lites), and even FZ's bodyguard Big John Smothers (Muffin Man), witness the onstage flogging of unwitting audience members with a real leather whip (&quot;This is Halloween, we don't **** around!!&quot;) and of course the recommended diet of Frank's own searing guitar work.  A truly priceless moment in the film is Bozzio's drumming/vocal performance on the epic finale &quot;Punky's Whips&quot;; if only they gave Oscars for best supporting musical performance in a documentary.As for the DVD package itself: It is presented as a case study of People Who Do Things That Are Not Normal, complete with file folder bearing the official seal of the Department of Entertainment Security containing typewritten documents, photographs, trade reviews and other critical evidence.  The transfer effort is admirable, though the film does show its age in some sections, graininess and a true live mix (not the &quot;enhanced&quot; type that Zappa favored on many audio releases) which at times loses definition.  That's rock 'n roll.  Due to compression and encoding issues associated with DVD production, the actual volume level is fairly low; this can of course be resolved by cranking your receiver, but you better be riding the levels when you push that menu button!  These are minor quibbles in light of this significant video chronicle of the man Frank Zappa, who wrote, produced, directed, scored (duh) and largely financed the original film into existence back in 1979.The result the closest we've got to a legacy to a creative mind like few others .... watch him work, watch him play, listen as he has his say (&quot;The important thing about this instrument is the way the air smells as it comes out of these holes&quot;), see the L&auml;ther Band onstage, venting Warner Brothers rage ..... and don't forget to vote.We will never forget you, Frank.",N/A
262819,"I was looking forward to the ""statement"" on culture that the packaging promised, but instead I watched what turned out to be a very long music video with many extremely disparate images juxtaposed to give some message that I wasn't getting.  In fact, I'm not sure there was much of a message--the filmmakers might have intended there to be one, but it's buried in a mix of visual images that are certainly striking, but definitely not cohesive enough to make the message clear.The filmmakers also have decided to focus solely on the grim side of culture, and there are so few smiling faces here that it makes you wonder if two-thirds of the people in the world live each day with grim, depressed looks on their faces.  By using slow motion so much, they tend to pull the dynamic side of life completely out of the picture, and it grows old very quickly.  Where are the playing children?  And as another reviewer said, they left out the abominable side of the third world, such as beatings and executions, and they've also left out the graft and corruption that make it difficult for anyone to help people in these countries.I felt all along that I was being manipulated, forced to watch images of their choice so that my worldview would become what they desired my worldview to be.  As a film, this is much better watched in segments, music piece by music piece, perhaps, as it does grow old after half an hour or so.  All in all, this is a beautiful effort, but beauty, of course, does not make for substance and depth (or even cohesion), which are elements that this film is lacking.",N/A

There are certainly many elements to his multi-faceted character. Also, Delroy Lindo stands out quite notably as the lead migrant worker on the farm Homer goes to live.  its interesting how Lindo's character both loves his daughter as a father and as a lover. You want to think of Lindo as evil but there is another side to him particularly in the final scene in which he appears.As evolving as the story is, there are many beautfiul scenery shots where the skyline is just stunning.  The architecture of the orphanage just completes the aesthetic beauty.  Overall, this earns my recommendation on all accounts.",The Cider House Rules VHS
110323,"Though I liked the novel, I found THE EXORCIST to be more laughable than frightening. I didn't see the second movie, and popular opinion indicates that I am better off. However, since I had heard very good things about this third installment, and though it might not date as badly, I decided to rent it.This story takes place fifteen years after the original film. Someone is murdering people in ways which emulate those of a serial killer who was executed years ago -- ways known only to the police who were on the case. Even though it seems impossible, one detective believes there is a connection not only to the earlier series of murders, but to the exorcism of young Regan McNeill fifteen years prior.LEGION was written and directed by William Peter Blatty from his own novel. While the direction is often interesting the script and acting are often unintentionally funny. (Witness an early scene in which George C. Scott's character talks about a fish in his bathtub with deadly seriousness.) There is some great work from Brad Dourif, who plays a patient in the hospital's ""disturbed"" ward. But like most any other film that uses religious phenomena as its basis, it makes little sense in the end -- it's a hodgepodge of weird happenings and biblical nonsense that doesn't add up.  And why does the devil ever do any of the things he does, anyway?  Boredom?  Had a little extra time on his hands?  The only people who find this sort of thing disturbing are the fundamentalists Christians who actually believe it's real.  Oh, there is one very effective scare about two thirds of the way in, wonderfully set up.  But it's a ""make you jump"" moment.  There's nothing deeper than that.The DVD has no bonus material other than a trailer, which is really just a teaser that doesn't show anything. The picture and sound quality are very good, though.",N/A

During her time there she finds some goose eggs that later hatch. As soon as the geese hatch the first thing they see is Amy and so they imprint on her, thinking she is their mother. Due to the geese natural instinct to fly south, and the fact that they don't have their real mother to lead the way, Amy with the help of her father attempt to lead the geese south in their own hang gliders.This is a very simple story done well, helping to create a pretty much perfect family movie. Jeff Daniels as Amy's father and Oscar winning Anna Paquin as Amy are equally fantastic, and I'd also like to give a shout out to Terry Kinney as Amy's uncle who is really quite funny. The directing by Carroll Ballard is brilliant and the cinematography is breathtaking and makes you feel like you are flying with Amy, her Dad and the geese. Not to mention the truly inspirational score by Mark Isham that is helping us along on our journey.The DVD special features which although not necessarily entertaining are appropriately informative.

After 9/11 the mad bomber/terrorist story line made Ticker about as bankable as a Howard the Duck sequel.  And, of course, the film is appalling.Where to begin?  I wasn't expecting much.  Just a bad B-movie with enough action to while away 90 minutes or so.  Between Seagal, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Hopper, Peter Greene, and Nas all showing up, how bad could it be?Bad.  The film is literally so incoherent that I had difficulty following what was going on in whole sequences.  There are gun battles where everyone looks the same, everyone is shooting, and you can't follow the action.  The editing is so bad that the film often resembles a series of scenes just spliced together.

The police station is filmed from the same angle over and over, suggesting that if someone stepped the wrong day the set wall would come crashing down.  The acting is laughable, as if everyone was equally embarrassed to be involved.  Dennis Hopper's Irish accent (which disappears and then reappears in true bad-film-accent-style) is amusing, as are the other Irish 'terrorists' (merely bad looking guys in black leather jackets).  Jamie Pressley, whose face looks like itwas warped by one of those computer programs, plays a terrorist.  Uh huh.  By the time Ice-T showed up for all of 15 seconds, I was convinced he just happened to be wandering by the set that day when they gave him a part.Speaking of black leather jackets, it seems the entire cast got a cut rate deal on form-disguising wardrobes.  A very bloated TomSizemore walks around the entire film in the same outfit.  It looks like he had a month between rehab stints or court appearances to make this film, and he phones in a performance that includes him screaming in his dying partner's face, &quot;Don't die!&quot; as well as screaming at witnesses to &quot;Tell me his name!&quot;Then there's Seagal.  You want to believe he can mount another comeback, but there's no chance.  You'd think that after Exit Wounds he would be back in the game.  Instead he's back on the Weight Gainer 2000, like he's gone from worshipping Buddha to trying to resemble him.  He's enormous in this film, clad in black, his hairline disappearing, his dialogue (and bizarre accent) as laughable as any he's done, and then some.  He spends most of the film sitting down, filmed like Brando in Apocalypse Now to hide his appearance.  By the time he hoists his bulk out of a chair, his fight scenes are once again filmed in almost total darkness so we have no idea what's going on.  We see hands moving, limbs flying, Seagal's face a mask of constipation, all to hide the fact that he is completely incapable of doing any stunt work or anything resembling a convincing fight scene.  Matter of fact, I have no doubt that Seagal's contract stipulates that he cannot be photographed to look as fat as he really is or that he can't actually exert himself beyond reciting Zen nonsense while someone is trying to disarm a bomb.  The man is an embarrassment, but the fact that he goes on with the charade lends him a certain charm.  I will continue to watch his movies with the morbid curiosity of someone who wants to see just how bad things can get.The amazing part is that 99% of the people watching Ticker will know more about police procedure, terrorism, and film making than the people behind this movie.  Some kind of credit must be given for the total disregard of anything resembling quality that went into it.Seagal is determined to play up his bad boy, mysterious man with a mysterious past, Zen spouting, tough guy persona to the bitter end, so why not tune in for a good laugh?  He has at least one classic bit where he actually kicks the bumper of a car hard enough to deploy an airbag, a scene I had to rewind because I was laughing so hard.I could go on and on, that's how bad the whole affair is.  Ticker is, in my humble opinion, Seagal's worst hour.  And given such efforts as Half Past Dead and The Patriot, that is saying something.  Don't let anyone in the cast fool you--it's bad.  It's bad-TV-movie bad.",Ticker artisan
130457,"We all can tend to be a little too critical at times..I've had that problem for years.  Sure this movie is predictable and has a lot of those old cliches we've seen dozens of times before.  So the real issue is did I still enjoy it?  Yes, very much so.  Bruce Beresford's direction brought out splendid performances from Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and Bruce Greenwood.  Even though Ashley's Libby does some incredibly stupid and dangerous things, I jumped right in and rooted her on.  Greenwood's Nicholas/Simon/Jonathan is a lesson in sociopathic sleeze.  Not only does he let his wife go to prison for his murder, he tells their son that his mother is dead, marries his wife's best friend, and then kills her in a gas explosion.  One of the vilest creatures to hit film in some time.  Tommy Lee is once again the Fugitive Hunter, but he's cool.  Some of the action scenes are great and the ending serves up what you wanted..revenge and reunion.I liked it.",N/A
326183,"This film has the ability  and the drive to be a serious wake-up call for parents, teachers, and students.  Unfortunatly, it jumps from drama to comedy so much that you feel that the producers-writers-directors have long gave up on the film or at least can't make up their minds.  Don't get me wrong, there is a messege to be heard here, but the writers can't seem to hit it on the head, just what they want to say. A quick example would be when the school is raided by the police, and they conduct a search of all the lockers.  A clearly mentally disturbed student (played wonderfully by Crispen Glover) is shot for trying to remove a gun from his locker.  Instead of going with this impact for a while and trying to get into the other character's head, the film quickly jumps to comedy by the next scene. And that's the end of that.  The school is being sued by an ex-student who graduated without learning to read.  It is an honest and hard look at our education sysytem, and again, the politics that get in the way.  Nolte is outstanding as always, as is Judd Hirsh in a strong post Taxi role.  The problem is:  How can viewers take ""Teachers"" seriously when we feel that the filmmakers themselves don't?",N/A

259930,"What can I possibly add that 300 + reviews haven't already stated.I know after watching Red Dragon (the Brett Ratner version) I wanted to write Michael Mann a personal letter (definitely not my style!!!) thanking him for the beautiful movie he made in 1986 called Manhunter.It has always been one of my favourite, must have movies, and after seeing Red Dragon, I now knew why. For those who Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal/Red Dragon were first introductions to these characters, I wish they had only been acquainted with 'Manhunter' first, but generational and promotional gaps can't be helped. Mann's film was low budget, but he presented one of the most influential crime films of its time. The style and atmosphere were an inspiration to many a movie and television drama after it, despite its lack of monetary backing.I rewatched Manhunter after Red Dragon, and even noticed that Jodie Foster played her character in Silence of The Lambs much like Petersen did, even down to facial twitches when speaking to Hannibal. There's something about the Frankenstein Dungeon atmosphere of the 90's adaptions of Hannibal that has always for me 'telegraphed' the menace of the cannibal psychologist, but I always felt that Anthony Hopkins was brilliant as Hannibal just by the sheer menace that boiled underneath him. Great actor, and I personally feel he saves all 3 films from a slight mediocrity when held in comparison to Mann's Manhunter. Hannibal in an all- white prison cell (as in Manhunter) somehow allows the actor to ''create'' that menace in a blank space. The big difference in Hannibal's (Cox &amp; Hopkins) is the speed in which they deliver their insanity. Hopkins is very slow and menacing, manipulative and calculating in speech, Brian Cox quick and sure-footed, adapting quickly to each situation and response as it arrives. I feel both are suited for that character. But there was something about Cox's way of getting Will Graham's home phone number in Manhunter that I found more believeable and chilling at how easy it was gotten. Hopkins is a wonderful actor, and I can only imagine what Mann could have done if given the liberty to work with him, but Cox is certainly admirable and credible in the role as well. Understated is the word. Hopkins LOOKS crazy. I'm not so sure I would go to him for psychological advice. Cox is much more approachable, and thats where the danger is.There is so much in Mann's Manhunter that stylistically, atmospherically and artistically dwarfs the later adaptions, even though it was low budget, that I cannot even begin to describe how well this movie worked on so many levels. The main one being, the characters are so much more defined. Details from the book are somewhat left out, but what is brought in its stead is 'mood'. Dennis Farina carries the protective air over Petersen's Graham to much greater effect. The feeling is that Farina's Crawford is just as in danger of falling over the psychological 'edge' as Petersen's Graham, but he serves as a foothold for the character should they start falling. You start caring about these characters and their dependency on eachother in mad circumstances, Lecktor/Graham/Crawford and The Red Dragon/Tooth Fairy Dolarhyde. The relationships are shown and explored through camerawork and very understated acting. Everything is very low key. Until the menace begins to grow.Brilliant film. Too bad Mann was not asked to direct Red Dragon. THAT would have been justice!",N/A

Princess Atta is extremely nervous as this is her first year in charge.  Things don't go as planned when Flik accidentally knocks all the food into the water.  As a way to get rid of him while they met the increased demands, the colony sends him off to find warrior bugs to protect them.  Through a series of mistakes, he finds a bunch of disgraced circus performers instead.  Will they find a way to protect the colony?This movie already seems to be delegated to the bottom of Pixar's list of movies, which is a real shame.  As with all their movies, it's wonderful.  The action keeps up at a brisk pace, the characters are likeable, the voice talent is wonderful, and there are plenty of laughs for everyone.  This is also the first of their movies to feature outtakes.  The animation does date the movie a little.  The bugs look a little plasticy.  However, some of the effects are wonderful, especially the fog and rain.This was the first of Pixar's movies to be released on DVD.  The picture clarity and sound were news worthy at the time because it was the first movie released directly from the digital source.  That clarity still holds up today.  They went all out with the extras, featuring an informative audio commentary, and all the behind the scenes info you could want.  I especially liked looking at the original story idea and seeing the wide to full screen comparisons.Don't get so caught up in the hype around their other movies that you over look this one.

618585,"""Love Actually"" is just the right mix of romantic comedy and drama to leave you with that warm, fuzzy feeling as you leave the theatre.  It's an ideal Christmas movie for moms and dads who want to see something else while the kids venture into more PG films.Writer/director Richard Curtis enlists a plethora of some of the finest British actors (and a few noteworthy Americans) to tell several different love stories.  While it seems that there may be a few too many characters at first, the overall flow of the film allows the viewer to keep track quite easily.  The cast is led by the ever-so-charming Hugh Grant as the British Prime Minister.  While some critics have called this casting unbelievable, Grant actually pulls it off by portraying a more human, but yet stronger PM that we would all love to have leading us.  His dance to the Pointer Sisters' ""Jump for My Love"" borders a bit on ridiculous, but it is nevertheless fun to watch.  In the film, the PM is caught between leading his country with a clear head, or giving in to his feelings of attraction to his tea server Natalie (played by musical actress Martine McCutcheon).And then there's Emma Thompson, who plays Karen, sister to Grant's PM and a long-married devoted mother.  She suspects that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) may be cheating with a sexy co-worker.  Her performance, simply put, is a revelation.  The scene where she is in her bedroom is an example of phenominal acting.  Hollywood Foreign Press and Academy members: please take notice!Another strong performance award goes to Bill Nighy, who provides most of the film's comic relief as aging rock star Billy Mack.  He puts out a cheesy Christmas record and then publicly bashes it.  But in classic Hollywood ending style, he does have an epiphany and realizes his wild musician life has been missing true affection.Liam Neeson shines as widower Daniel who tries to help his young stepson win the heart of a popular school crush.  Equally sweet is Colin Firth as Jamie, a man recovering from a broken relationship in France who falls for his monolingual Portuguese maid.  You know what?  This film is such an abundance of great performances that I will run out of space discussing them all!  Everybody shines!  My only cast complaint is that Rowan Atkinson should have been given more screen time.What I also love about ""Love Actually"" is that Curtis doesn't, if you'll pardon the pun, wrap up each story in a happy little Christmas package.  There are a few sad, realistic moments, particularly in the Karen/Harry subplot and in Laura Linney's turn as Sarah, an assistant who has waited so long to be with the man she loves.  She realizes, in some of the film's key dramatic instances, that family matters are getting in the way.All in all, Curtis has struck gold again, in tradition of movies like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary.""  Yeah, some of the love stories may be a little far-fetched, but aren't they all in fantasy movie world?  What matters is that they are sweet and not without their share of obstacles.  This film is a nice departure from some of the more disturbing violent films as of late.  But be warned: it is a little more adult than most other comedies in theatres. The innuendos, language, and nudity earn the R-rating.  So see it without the young kids, but do enjoy.",Love Actually

Certainly, the slow pace of bar room banter coupled with the latent rage of the characters do not make for gripping drama. Yet, for the patient viewer, this award-winning Spanish movie becomes cinema verite at its best. The many subtle shades of human emotion and motives in the lives of these characters as they precariously tread in unemployment, are rendered with an unhurried pace which matches the reality they face daily of no real exit from misfortune other than to console themselves with each other. The movie turns out to be a winner!",Mondays in the Sun
702624,"A fascinating universe with many races and plots centered around a human that happened be pulled away from Earth in a worm hole. He ends up in a new complex world of aliens. The world is very well put together with much creativity and flare for the unusual. At times (especially when you first start watching the show) it may appear silly or corny. However, the characters and the world they are in really grows on you. I am now approaching the very final two episodes of season one and feel a little bit sad to leave this little fictional universe. I am looking forward to the second season. It is a great show and if you love Sci-Fi I cannot see how you would not be drawn to this creative work. The only drawback with the series is that it is difficult to jump into (i.e. it is helpful to have followed the series). Even though many episodes are self-contained there are several story lines that connect the episodes. I personally first saw episodes from season 3 and was thoroughly confused. When I bought season one I got the opportunity to follow the buildup of the characters and the plot. I love this show and highly recommend it!

Like their previous film The Adventures of Felix, the main character, Etienne, is on a journey.When he receives a video camera for his birthday, Etiennce begins relentlessly filming the people and events in his life...his mother, grandmother, best friend Ludovic, and his teacher Laurent.What starts as a way for him to chronicle the coming year of his life (a year, he tells Ludovic, that he will find love), becomes a discovery for both the viewer and Etienne himself. We learn as much about him from the events of his life as we do about the subjects his camera lovingly captures. Is there a reason most of his subjects are men?To try and explain the plot of this movie, if there really is one, is to not do it justice. The movie is shot entirely through the lens of Etienne's camera, but never seems gimicky, forced, or unbelievable. We are part of his life, and because of this, we take an interest in Etienne's ultimate discovery about himself.The fact that Etienne is a figure skater (actor Jimmy Taveres is himself an accomplished skater) plays prominently in the movie. His goals for the year ahead are to win a figure skating competiton, find happiness, and find true love, although not necessarily in that order.How, or even if, he reaches these goals is the real treat of this charming movie, filled with appealing, believable characters.",N/A
246395,"John McTiernan's star has been fading lately, but it shone like a supernova with 1988's Die Hard, a taut and exciting action thriller that made Bruce Willis an international star and began a trend of explosion-laden action thrillers that followed its basic formula -- sometimes successfully, but more often not.The story takes a basic Western-movie plotline (lone hero faces off against a band of menacing black hats) and pulls it forward into the late 20th Century.  N.Y. Detective John McClane (Willis) arrives in L.A. for a Christmas vacation with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and their children.  At a Christmas office party in the still unfinished Nakatomi building (where Holly has an executive office), a band of what seems to be a group of well-financed terrorists takes most of the partygoers hostage.  It is up to McClane, who luckily is in a rest room as Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his thugs crash the party, to foil the villains and rescue the hostages.McTiernan, working from a screenplay by Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza, blends in various types of styles into Die Hard.  With the relationship between McClane and L.A. police Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald Veljohnson) he inserted the ""buddy picture.""  With the police angle, he uses the ""cops and robbers"" theme.  The screenplay and movie also highlight wit and droll humor -- especially on Gruber's part. As the prime mover of the action, it's Gruber who's the protagonist, with Willis as the heroic antagonist.The 5-Star Collection DVD is one of 20th Century Fox's best releases to date.

519811,"Truly, this is THE best picture of the year, though not the Extended Edition; I do own both and I felt compelled to review this one.Kudos to Peter Jackson for surfacing through the muck of the off the wall and quite ridiculous films he used to make, thank God.  His artistry and vision made for a compelling motion picture.This film employed some of the best on screen talents.  First, one of the greatest actors of all time, Sir Ian McKellan shines in a role he should for which he should have won Best Supporting Actor.  Orlando Bloom shone through in his breakout performance, and got even better in The Two Towers, funny since they were filmed at the same time.  And Viggo Mortenson is the dark horse hero, the unexpected sex symbol in a very powerful role protraying a very deep character.  His is also a performance worth and Oscar nomination.  Sean Astin and Elijah Wood were great, but convinving me that Hobbits were real.The cinematography was astounding, filmed in one of the most beautiful places on Earth: Australia.  The sweep and scope of the camera angles and sceneic images are awe inspiring and breath taking.  The visuals are mind boggling, the creatures that were created and the make up used on the humans (goblins and orcs and what not) was astounding.  The Hobbit feet, though gross, are painstakingly applied and mastered, so to speak, even though their feet.  Meticulous Peter Jackson, like Michael Mann and his Native American costumes in The Last Of The Mohicans.The script stayed true to the classic fairy tale, using many of Tolkien's timeless word.  It was definitely a faithful adaptation of the literary classic trilogy.  It's is a subtle allegory to the Bible and much of it is allegorical to the First World War.  However, the allegory of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia is more evident.The score is superb.  Everyone seems to have a theme song.  The Hobbits have a happy little ditty that demonstrates their generally jovial nature and happy lifestyle.  The fairy's have floaty numbers, airy and sweet, very passionate.  The dark forces of Saruman are represnted by percussion driven songs, very deep, dark and sinister sounding.As for the end, it leaves you hanging.  If you haven't read the classic trilogy, you're gonna be mad, but you're gonna be on the edge of your seat because you want to keep watching and you just can't wait for the next event to happen.  But you found out you had to wait a year, or a few weeks, days, whenever, depending on when you first saw Fellowhsip.  But The Towers is well worth the wait.All in all, The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is the best picture of 2002.  Unfortunately A BORING MIND stole the prize from the rigtful winner.  But I won't let that get me down and neither should you.  This is science fiction/fantasy as at it's very best and can only be outdone by the rest of the movies in its own trilogy.  This is a film with few peers and is truly a landmark of cinema, not just for the finished product but also for the uncommon practice of the process of shooting all three movies at the same time.  This is a film that you should not miss, a story of triumph over adversity, loyalty, faith, devotion, romance and good over evil.  This is a outstanding film and I give it my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

The interviews with the vetrans make it something very special. This is the last generation that these vetrans will be alive to tell their story, and we should listen and learn from them; they are us, and this war is something different from any war before or since.

Pretty much everyone who has had to work in a cubicle will find something they can identify with in this film. Office Space uncannily recreates and satirizes situations most of us have had on the job, whether it is the ominous threat of a reduction in force, listening to corporate gobbledygook or dealing with a smarmy jerk of a boss.The difference between those of us in the real world and Ron Livingston's character is that he loses all cares about his hated job and actually strikes back at the corporate powers that be. As such, the first half of this film is absolutely hilarious. We vicariously live out our dreams to smash the jam-prone printer, knock out a cubicle wall, and skip work for a day of fishing. Fortifying the movie are quirky supporting characters - a white computer geek who listens to gangsta rap, a perpetually cheery temp, a mumbling weirdo, and so forth.The movie does begin to drag a bit during the second half, as the story moves away from office rebellion, to a floundering embezzlement scheme.

805803,"There is a Bible passage that goes like this:""If I Speak with the tongues of men and angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.  And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.  And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.""  (I Cor. 13:1-3 NASV)After watching P.J. Hogan's (My Best Friends Wedding) brand new retelling of J.M. Barrie's classic novel, I think we can see this old passage come to life.If you've spent the last century living under a rock then you'll have never learned of the little boy who never grew up.  You'll have never seen Walt Disney's chaste adventure, Steven Speilberg's reimagining, or Mary Martin's stupid musical.  You've never been enchanted by thinking good thoughts or laughed yourself silly by not believing in fairies (Oh darn, I just killed another one).  If you have been deprived by never having read or even seen this enchanting story unfold, then I suggest you rush out to your local library and read the book.For those of us who know the story, I will tell you that this is the most faithful adaptations of the book and also the most interesting.  For the first time in cinematic history Peter is not seen as a hero, but as what he truly is; a sad lonely boy who's trapped in a fantasy world of his own design.  A boy who has the whole world at his fingertips and yet has the one thing he can never have: love.I was blown away by how this film is so bold.  Every other PETER PAN film or story usually features a woman or a grown man in the part.  But for once this film shows us the Peter that truly exists.I remember seeing J.M. Barrie's stage play by the Royal Shakespeare in 2000.  I remember how the press made a big deal about the play because it was the first time a male would play him on stage and when I got there I saw an effeminate male prancing around.  What was missing was the light of a child's eyes and that's what this PETER PAN has.  The illusion of a boy who never grows up is lost if he's played by someone who has already grown up.Jeremey Sumpter (Fraility) plays Peter with exuberance and the hint of sadness that is always under the surface.  While we cannot be children forever, don't we all long for that?  But what if you could be a child forever, as the world grows up around you?  Your fantasy world may start to lose its luster.I also loved how Neverland was full of danger.  I remember going through my old writings and finding a book I tried to write when I was four or five.  In it was a mother dying and lots of violence. Innocent and cute on the outside, but all my inward fantasies were full of violence.  This Neverland is full of peril, from the Mermaids who want to drown you, to the large Croc who swallowed a clock.  Neverland may be a fun place, but it's definitely not a safe place.  Much like the playgrounds of old.The other more important story points that this new film really handled well was the innocent sexual tension created by two children.  Peter and Wendy are still at the point where girls and boys are icky, but yet are brought together by fantasy and fun.  What was your first crush like?  Kind of awkward and a little funny.I loved to watch the fantasy of the two of them dancing in the moonlight.  Their attempt to play the role of mother and father when they have no idea how, and their longing to be together.  Since they are young, they do not have the facilities to understand this feeling.Rachael Hurd-Wood portrays Wendy with a gentile innocence.  This is her first film, but she's so good other roles cannot be far off.  She reminds me of a young Nicole Kidman.  Her character is nicely rounded and full of the childlike wonder you normally see in the role.I would also be remiss if I didn't mention PETER PAN'S nemesis Captain Hook.  Jason Issac's (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) Hook is faithful but a tad too dark for it's own good.  It's also a little creepy to watch this grown man's obsession with a little boy.  But then you begin to understand that Hook is Peter Pan's manifestation of his own adulthood.  What's the easiest way to never grow up?  Turn your adult tendencies into the villain and then manifest your childhood hopes and dreams into a little fairy named Tink (Ludivine Sagnier, Swimming Pool).All in all PJ Hogan's PETER PAN is really good.  If you're in the mood for a bold film with lots of laughs and lots of adventure, then run out and see Peter Pan.",N/A
777579,"Sixth season of Buffy: The vampire slayer, proved to be the hardest to swallow for fans of the show. I loved it. I find allways that difficult is better... and this was a difficult season to watch. The writers took the characters to their darkest possible places. The storylines are, as follows: Buffy is returned from heaven by Willow, Xander, Anya and Tara, but she is unable to adjust herself to being on earth again. Everything hurts her. Her only way to feel alive is to take her body to the limit, and she can do that (being a slayer, who is used to fights and physical stress) only by using Spike, sexually. Willow finds herself falling into a magic ""addiction"", which even makes her endanger Dawn and break up with Tara. By the end of the season she'll learn that repression was not the way to go, and that it can take her to destroy the world. Xander's unsaid doubts about getting married with Anya finally explode and he leaves her right before the wedding, making her go back to being a vengeance demon. Giles finds that his presence is holding Buffy back, so he decides to go to England, even against Buffy's wishes. Dawn is unable to find herself in the midst of this entire chaos, so she turns to theft in order to make herself adequate to the group, and to call for help. By the end of the season, of course, everything comes together to create a perfect finalle for the year, in which the group falls appart (pretty much from Enthropy) and it is the end of the world... again.This season will have many of the most memorable moments of the series for me: Spike trying to rape Buffy is priceless, and it is so perfectly done: the angles... the frame... the abscence of music... they really achieved a perfect moment. Warren falling in the hands of Willow. Anya walking alone down the altar. The entire Once more, with feeling episode. Buffy trying to kill he friends in order to gain sanity. The entire two final episodes of the season. Willow hurting Xander as he tries to save her and the world. Tara and Buffy getting shot by Warren. Buffy and Spike bringing down the house as they ""make love"".This season contains:Bargaining I & II: Buffy is brought back, while a bunch of demons terrorize Sunnydale. 9.8.Afterlife: Buffy has brought something along with her. 9.6Flooded: Buffy is broke. The troika makes its appearance. 9.4Life serial: Buffy is tested by the nerds. 9.7All the way: Dawn falls for a kid with nocturnal habits. 9Once More, with feeling: What can be said about this one? 10Tabula Rasa: A spell gone wrong makes everyone forget everything. 10Smashed: Spike learns he can hurt Buffy and Willow brings back Amy. 10Wrecked: Willow falls in the hands of a warlock. 10Gone: Buffy, the invisible vampire slayer. 9.6Double-meat Palace: Buffy has a new job. 8.5Dead things: Buffy tries to find out why Spike can hurt her... she must have something wrong. 9Older and far away: While celebrating Buffy's birthday, everyone gets trapped in the house. 9.7As you were: Riley's return leads to the end of Buffy's relationship with Spike. 8.5Hell's Bells: Xander's and Anya's wedding. 9.8Normail Again: Is everything just a delusion? 10Entropy: Anya seeks vengeance against Xander... but she only finds sollace in Spike. 10Seeing Red: The trio finds a huge source of power. 10Villians: With Buffy and Tara being shot, Willow spins out of control and looks for Warren in order to punish him. 10Two to go: Buffy and Xander must protect Jonathan and Andrew from Willow. 10Grave: Giles return to stop Willow, but he only gives her the power to end the world. 10I think that this season can be more cherished watching in DVD.

He did an excellent job, and it is truly suspenseful from the beginning to the very end.  I honestly thought was the villain--the truth is shocking, hence the title.This is an excellent DVD from Alpha Video-my favorite company for the sole reason that they concentrate on releasing the old films.  My only complaint and the reason that this DVD only gets 4 stars is because there are times when the picture is rather faint and the sound gets muffled.  Other than that, the film is in great shape.I highly recommend this film to anyone who is in the mood for a good, atmospheric suspense film from the golden age of movies.

98416,"This is the original of all the five movies they made about crime and the Inspector Harry Callahan.A rooftop serial sniper is terrorizing San Francisco and sends a letter to the mayor, threatening to kill homosexuals or negroes if his demands aren't met.He kidnaps a young girl and unfortunately she dies. He sends her teeth through the mail to verify that he has her.This movie was inspired by the zodiac killings of the sixties and if you read the book Zodiac it verifies that. I had figured that out before I read the book.Another connection is that Scorpio, the serial killer in Dirty Harry, played by Andrew Robinson,is a sign of the Zodiac which is another indication that Dirty Harry was inspired by these killings.Also when you watch this movie you can see what inspired Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon to write the scene where the lead characters tries to talk a man out of committing suicide on top of a roof. The same thing happens in Dirty Harry.This movie was written with Frank Sinatra as Dirty Harry but I can't imagine that Sinatra would have played him as Eastwood did. Eastwood was good in playing Harry tough. Can I imagine Sinatra playing Dirty Harry? Maybe. But he certainly wouldn't have been as good. The part wouldn't have suited him as much as Eastwood because I believe that Eastwood can play tough better.When Harry meets the killer at the end after jumping off a bridge onto a school bus full of kidnapped children (another scene inspired by the ravings of the Zodiac killer)he asks him,""Do you feel lucky?"" He must have. He went for his gun but he run out of luck.",N/A
619344,"Have you ever sat through a movie that is really good, has a compelling story, great characters, and yet still felt a little cold?  I mean you really liked the movie, it made you think, it didn't play down to you, and yet you were hoping for little bit more?  Sophia Coppola's new film LOST IN TRANSLATION, is a good movie with a great movie caught inside it.TRANSLATION stars Bill Murray (Groundhog Day) as Bob Harris, a former hotshot action star at the end of his career.  His marriage may be falling apart, his life is coming unraveled, and he's just been offered two million dollars to hawk an alcoholic beverage in Japan.  Life seems to be getting worse until he strikes up a relationship with an unlikely friend.Her name is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, The Man Who Wasn&#65533;t There) and she just so happens to be in the same boat.  Her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi, The Other Sister) is living a dream and ignoring her.  She's alone in a city of millions.TRANSLATION is so rich with ideas.  Here you're presented with two people who are alone forced to cling to each other for lack of anyone else.  In America would these two friends ever find each other?  Probably not, but here they are strangers in a strange land and all that makes a difference.Bill Murray once again takes the smart road and distances himself from the films that made him a star.  He plays a character of such stunning vulnerability and yet silly charm.  I loved how he disappears into a scene.  You forget you&#65533;re looking at the guy from MEATBALLS.  I sometimes miss the silly and crazy actor he once was, but at least when he turns in a dramatic performance it's well worth watching.Johansson should also be congratulated for her fine performance.  I liked her understated charm and silly little smile.  The camera loves to linger on her because she&#65533;s got this unique screen presence.  Of course she's beautiful, but not as a typical actress is beautiful.  She's beautiful like that girl in you're high school homeroom is beautiful, or that random women on the street is beautiful.  Johansson can exist in the real world.  She's average and yet mysterious, cute and yet understated.All that aside the biggest problem with the movie is that much of the plot is half realized.  To make up for this Coppola trains her camera on Johansson as she a stare out windows, lays in bed, takes walk around Tokyo and then stares out the widow again.  A little of this is okay; it even worked sometimes.  I gave us a look inside her head.  But after we've figured out that she's lonely we keep watching her look out windows, and walk around.  It was too much and prolonged the meat of the movie, the relationship between her and Bob.To the films credit there is a great sequence in which Bob and Charlotte are laying together in a bed.  You can tell they have a connection that sparks are flying, in a Hollywood movie this is the point that they'd begin to kiss.  But in this film Bob does something far more interesting he just touches her foot.  In real life you have to face the ones you love in the morning, Best not throw it all away on a person you hardly know.TRANSLATION is about what connects people.  Is it a love story? Is it a story about friendship?  Is it a story about fidelity?  Is it about following your heart?  Yes and no, and maybe so.  What&#65533;s here is a compelling piece of filmmaking that dares you to do something we, as causal moviegoers, are seldom allowed to do.  It dares us to think.**** out of 5",Lost in Translation

739189,"In this documentary, Michael Moore uses his unique brand of wit to explore America's obsession with guns and violence. He depicts facts about our country's bloody past and present hitting the streets to talk to real people who are all in one way or another affected by guns. He makes you think as he tries to uncover why America has the highest death rate of people killed by guns in the world. I couldn't believe how different it is just to live in Canada. They support each other and have pride in who they are, unlike America's self-centered every-person-for-themselves attitude. The Canadian evening news actually talks about good things and their citizens don't live in constant fear. They had maybe 60 some gun related deaths in the past year to America's staggering 11,000 or so. Still, it isn't so much a film on gun control as it is a film on how we live daily in conformity, and how we are conditioned to believe things based on what we see in the media. He shows the sad stupidity of religious groups picketing a Marilyn Manson concert with the claims that Manson condones violence. But yet the hypocrites state that they won't let Manson in their city  &quot;not without a fight.&quot; Moore allows Manson to share his views, which is something that a lot of people need to do,  just sit down and listen and find out the truth about things before passing judgment. Moore challenges each and everyone one of us to use our freedoms as Americans to try and change the oppressiveness of our country, to stop fearing diversity and to speak up and have a voice. The first step in doing this is to just turn off the television. Stop bombarding our brains with all the negativity, blood shed, and urban legends that is conditioned into us so that we remain living in fear.With this, Moore won a much deserved Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The DVD includes a lot of extras including his feelings on winning the Oscar and about his Oscar speech.Bowling for Columbine is a very moving documentary that I think as Americans, everyone owes to themselves to experience.",Bowling For Columbine VHS
819421,"...that title remains with Unforgiven.Mystic river is a good movie, not a great one. It has a great story and great characters - with a good screenplay by Brian Helgeland, based on Dennis Lehane's book. The directing is solid, while not really bringing anything special to the film, yet pacing it prefectly in building the tension around the murder.What is outstanding about this film is the acting. Sean Penn gives yet another inspired performance as a working class father from Boston who just lost his oldest daughter to a horrific murder. Although the scenes that most people seem to remember (and that are shown in the trailer) show his *exaggerated* response to his daughter's death, the rest of the performance is more subdued and restrained.Tim Robbins' performance is also of note, as Penn's disturbed boyhood friend who shows up covered in blood the same night of the murder, making his frightened wife (Marcia Gay Harden) start to doubt his story and to believe that he is in fact the murderer.The rest of the cast give solid performances in somewhat limited characters, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne as the cops asigned to the case, and Laura Linney as Penn's second wife.However, there are a few things about the film that rubbed me the wrong way; the whole sub-plot about Bacon's wife calling him on his cell phone and not speaking? What was that suppossed to bring to the movie? Or Linney's (apparently) sudden transformation into Lady MacBeth, telling Penn's character that he should do whatever needed to be done? Or the final parade scene?In short, while not a great film (certainly not Eastwood's best), it's a good one worth catching, and not as bad as some other reviewers will have you believe (certainly not Mistake River!).",N/A

602988,"Frida should be celebrated for its fabulously colorful costumes and wonderful all-star cast alone. And of course, Salma Hayek in her amazing breakthrough performance is fantastic as bisexual Mexican artist Frida Kahlo--the film is engrossing and mesmerizing.Shot in and around the Mexico City locations where Kahlo, her husband, Diego Rivera, and their lovers lived and played, ""Frida"" brilliantly captures the brightness of the light, the intensity of the colors and the omnipresence of Mexican motifs that informed Kahlo's art. Director Taymor has smartly avoided the traps that make so many films about artists irritating, and the even bigger traps inherent in a biopic of a figure like Kahlo, who became the center of a feverish Sylvia Plath-like victim-cult in the '80s. Taymor eschews the standard Kahlo martyrology, emphasizing instead her triumph over physical and emotional agony, her humor and joie de vivre. And she makes the love that Kahlo shared with Rivera the real subject of the story.Taymor captures both the glamorous, deeply cosmopolitan milieu Kahlo and Rivera inhabited, and the importance Mexico had in the '30s for the international left. The only thing that lets down the feeling of authenticity is the odd accents adopted by cast members like Judd, Valeria Golino (who plays one of Rivera's ex-wives) and Geoffrey Rush.Overall, however, this is an ultimate triumph for Hayek.

33503,"I've recently seen this Patrick Stewart version of A Christmas Carol for the second time in hopes that I would like it more than when I saw it last year. I didn't.It's a handsome production...perhaps too handsome. The buildings and streets all look very quaint and clean and just so &quot;perfect&quot;. The 1984 production with George C. Scott was much grittier and darker and really created a sense of atmosphere.All of the supporting actors are decent in this most recent version, but not particularly memorable. For instance, the actor portraying Jacob Marley in the Stewart version has nothing on Frank Finlay, who was so chilling as Marley in 1984!I hate to say it, but Patrick Stewart is a very inadequate Scrooge. I know Scrooge is supposed to be a hard man in the beginning of the story, but Stewart is so stoic that you simply can't read anything from his expressionless face throughout most of the film, whereas all other actor's who have played the famous Dickens' character have been able to convey the appropriate bitterness or sadness that inhabits Scrooge.One particular choice Stewart makes is dead wrong: When Scrooge visits the &quot;Chrismas yet to come&quot;, he begins to realize that he is the dead man everyone's talking about BEFORE he sees his name on the tombstone. It's only when he sees his name that he fully comes to terms with his impending death...Every other actor who has portrayed Scrooge has understood this, but Stewart plays the scene as if he had no idea that he was the dead person UNTIL he reads his name on the stone! This choice is wrong because it ultimately makes Scrooge look as if he doesn't truly change his ways until that very moment...when Scrooge's transformation should occur slowly with every spirit's visit!I respect Patrick Stewart, but with his performance in A Christmas Carol, he demonstrates why he's no Alistair Sim, Albert Finney, George C. Scott or Michael Caine!",N/A

719577,"Firstly, I have to say, for me this movie was like the Howling meets Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, in terms of cast anyway. Have you ever noticed the complete lack of cool werewolf movies out there? I mean, all of this vampire garbage comes streaming out of Hollywood like fake blood running down a victim's neck, but where are the werewolves? I can think of a few, like Wolfen or American Werewolf in London, and of course the Howling, with its towering, vulpine bat-eared werewolves, which wasn't a great movie, but had the virtue of the first really noteworthy werewolf sequences.This movie finally does the poor hairy guys some jutice. It involves a military unit initially used as bait by another special ops division to draw out a clan of werewolves. This former unit becomes the group of underdog heroes forced to rock and roll with the werewolves in a tiny collage at the center of a vast wilderness. Of course, like any good horror movie, they throw in a pretty girl after a while, so I'm down with that. I can't actually say I recognized much of the cast, except for the guy that played Smith in Event Horizon, but that fact in itself adds a kind of positive element to the movie, like the way Chris Carter originally envisioned the X-Files. The solidiers are extremely capable, and sympathetic as characters. I hated seeing them go down, which is not always the case with these kind of movies. They were all noble warriors with stout hearts, never flinching in the face of the evil they're facing.The werewolves were not mindless monsters, but instead moderately strategic fighters ingrained with a wolf's pack mentality. As the movie unfolds, the human origins of the werewolves become apparent, and the solidiers finally realize they are much closer to home than originally suspected. a monster brawl rages through the night, with the werwolves apparently gaining in strength as the moon waxes. Very well done. I think if I had any complaint at all, I would have liked it if they had shown a little less of the werewolves themselves, keeping them darker-shadowed and a little more mystified. But don't let that one complaint create a shadow of doubt. This movie rocks from the floor all the way to the roof. It has a fair amount of gore, of course, A heap of fighting and improvised warfare, and killer visuals. The only reason I gave this movie five stars was that I couldn't give it more than that.

668289,"This chapter of the Friday the 13th series is better than most before and after it. For one thing, it has more energy, more old tension, some unsettled scores to settle!It begins where the last chapter left off. Back in the last chapter, our star hero, Tommy, had one mean terrifying showdown with Jason, the notorious hocky-masked serial murder from Camp Crystal Lake, who killed his friends and family. He did what many people got killed trying to do, kill Jason. And to add onto that, he did it as a child. Tommy Jarvis, now 25, is still haunted by visions and fear of his old nemesis, Jason Voorhees. He is comitted to a mental hospital, but therapy is not helping him forget the nightmare. Finally, Tommy decides to make sure Jason doesn't come back. Finding that Jason is still in his grave at the cemetary, Tommy drives a metal stake through Jason's chest in a fit of anger. But unfortunatly, he should have left Jason's grave alone. A lightning bolt stikes the pole, filling Jason's corpse with 100,000 volts of electircal energy (sound framiliar?). Within moments, the diabolical Jason is out of his coffin to pick up where he left off, and to get revenge on the one who killed him. Realizing that his nightmares of Jason returning from the grave were true, Tommy runs. He arrives at the sheriff's office and things go from bad to worse. Tommy is caught in a fix even bigger than the one he was in last time, for now he tells everyone that Jason is back, and no one believes him! Meanwhile, Camp Crystal Lake (now called Camp Forest Green in the hopes that it will help the residents forget the camp's bloody history) has reopened with lots of kids in for a weekend of fun and games at camp. While awaiting in a cell at the police station, Tommy takes on an ally, the sheriff's spunky and sexy daughter, Megan, who takes a fancy to him. Before long, however, Jason returns to his hunting ground at Crystal Lake and the body count begins to add up. Plus, the cynical and rather unfeeling sheriff thinks Tommy is doing the murders and accusing Jason to make people think that his story is true. Realizing that it's time to end it, Tommy escapes from the county prison with the help of Megan to save the innocent children campers before Jason does his worst homicide atrocity yet. But how can he do that with both a skeptical, over-protective sheriff and an undead, homicidal, machette-wielding maniac out top take him down?One reason why I liked this movie is that Jason has an old enemy. In most Friday the 13th movies, there are all new characters each time, not including Jason. Having an old enemy that brings us from a time long ago to now can really add to the twist of things. Plus, I find it great that the main character, hero, and protagonist of the movie is a guy and not a girl. In a lot of Jason movies, the surviving heroic character is a girl, with almost nothing to lose. In this one, they take it in a different direction with a male hero who has some unsettled scores. That what really makes this movie good. Another is that a whole camp full of innocent childrenis in danger. A common element in Jason movies is that kids are not really involved, for I have never really seen a Jason movie where young kids are in the danger of getting killed by Jason. This sort of thing adds to Tommy's determination to stop Jason.",N/A

771133,"I was a bit disappointed with the weak plot and horrible treatment of the characters in the first X-Men movie. As such, I was expecting X-2 to be equally disappointing, if not more so. Boy, am I glad to be wrong!X-2 is what the first movie should have been like (ie closer to the comic). We are forever stuck with the problems of the characters such as Kitty Pryde's character being put in Rogue's body so that in fact we get neither character, Iceman being a student of the school when in fact he is one of the original X-Men, Pyro taking up screen time when he was never part of the X-men (and a stupid character anyway)... I could go on.X-2 also continues the flaw of the first film in that the X-Men are nothing more than few characters with some odd powers they barely control when they should be a fully functioning team with absolute control over their powers. What separates the X-Men from every other mutant is their comraderie and intense training. In the comics, they are powerful, saving the world many times over. In the movies we are constantly seeing them get their butts kicked because they have to stop and concentrate before using any powers. This has improved however. Nightcrawler for instance is one bad mofo who is very close to what he should be. Jean-Grey discovers her powers are increasing (appearantly after the events of the first film) and by the end, she is how she should have been all along. Fans of Wolverine will get to see him actually be Wolverine for once.X-2 succeeds partially because it doesn't attempt to give you some goofed up ""starting-out"" story like the first film. It plays like an issue of the comics; you pick an issue up, the action is already flowing, and you have to catch up. From the very opening scene of the movie, you know this is a different film than the first. Every super powered character in the film just seems to be more awe inspiring, capturing the magic of comic book heroes (for the most part).This film sees an even bigger threat to the world than the first film. The previews make it seem to be a threat to the school and about Wolverine's past, when in fact those are really only small parts of it. It's better if you don't know the plot, as I didn't. The finale is ripped out of one of the most dramatic events in X-Men history, and for the fans that recognize it, there is a nice teaser at the very end that makes me think the best is yet to come!If you liked the first X-Men movie, you really should see X-2. It's going to go down in history as one of the few sequels that's actually better than the original (by a good margin I should add). There's more action, more characterization, more FX, and most importantly more story. It's still not as good as it could have been, but considering how lacking the first film was, it's good enough!",N/A
732994,"Back when Futurama debuted it was looking like the perfect successor to the Simpsons, which by 1999 was running out of steam after many stupendous years. As a longtime Matt Groening fanatic I would have been happy to watch the Simpsons come to a dignified end while it was still at the height of its powers, so Futurama could carry the torch for the next decade or so. Alas, no props are deserved by the Fox network for allowing the awesome Futurama to die a lonely death in ratings hell. But this great DVD set for the first season broadcasts loud and clear what could have been. Utilizing the standard sci-fi method of using a futuristic society to comment on our current state (or more often to poke fun at it), the series features eye-catching computerized 3-D animation and incredibly well written and subversive storylines. And just like all Groening creations the characters are robust and fully realized. In addition to the stars, such as Bender who is probably the most hysterical character ever created, we also get great and under-appreciated supporting characters like Zap Branigan, Kif, and Dr. Zoidberg.Unlike the Simpsons which needed a first developmental season to really get its groove going, Futurama started full blast right from the first episode, in which the 20th century dork Fry wakes up in the year 3000 and tries not to be a loser in another millennium. While I never much liked the talking 20th century heads in jars (indicators of a certain lack of hardcore creativity, in my opinion), the 30th century society of Futurama has much to teach us in these early episodes. Corporate power and corruption are lampooned twice this season in ""A Fishful of Dollars"" and the brilliant ""Fry and the Slurm Factory,"" fad religions are tackled in ""Hell Is Other Robots,"" and there's even a condemnation of our current environmental attitudes in ""A Big Piece of Garbage."" The DVD extras aren't too much to get excited about, although the audio commentary accompanying each episode (by Groening and the show's other creators) is a real treat if you're looking for collector's trivia and the inspiration behind the characters and storylines. I will enjoy this DVD set for the next thousand years and hope Fox can get the remaining seasons out quickly. It's the least they could do, after letting this work of genius go to waste.",Futurama: Volume One

203889,"Some may argue there is nothing witty about murder, which you see in this film in the first few minutes committed by two elegantly dressed and well groomed handsome men on another elegantly dressed and handsome man in a well appointed apartment with a magnificent view of the city.  Moreover, these two dandies just have to SEE if they can commit the perfect murder.  In some ways the film is not just a meditation on good and evil, and at heart, the ethics of killing another human being, but also considers the recreation activities of those who have &quot;everything&quot;.  When one has every material advantage, the biggest house, the most exprensive car, a lover, drugs (presumably) what now for fun?  And what if you are among the most intelligent and well educated individual on earth, doesn't that make you better than others and give you the right to make decisions over others lives?

I was concerned that this was strictly a ""Let's get on the Yoga Bandwagon"" project. However, knowing that Rod Stryker was her partner in this made me give it a try because Rod is the ""Real Deal"".This video is actually led by Rod Stryker w/ Kathy Smith assisting him (which is a very smart move on Kathy Smith's part and gives it much more credibility ""Yoga wise"" in my opinion).It's a very complete yoga routine, with Gentle Warmups, Sun Saluations (w/ pushups between up/down dog), a complete standing pose practice, Short balancing segment, a very complete backbending routine plus forward bends, inversions and relaxation. There is a clear explanation of Ujayi Breathing at the beginning as well.I found this tape to be enjoyable to practice with, easy to follow and challenging as well.I actually took it out of the library to try it out and was so impressed that I just ordered her Ultimate Yoga DVD set which has her three Yoga Programs, I've tried all three and had to have them.By the way, I thought Rod actually came across better in this video than he does in his ""Yoga For Longevity"" video where he seems a bit stiff and mechanical (even though that is a WONDERFUL video which I highly recommend).Also, if you want to try another really great and challenging video, check out Sherri Baptiste's ""Baptiste Power Of Yoga"" video (which is an intermediate level video)as well as her brother Baron Baptiste's excellent collection of videos (in particular his ""live"" set). Of course Bryan Kest has some of the best videos out there as well if you're looking for a real challenge with another excellent teacher.Namaste",N/A

LOOK AT MY WORK OF ART!""Apparently, Punch-Drunk Love is some sort of American rip of Jean Pierre Jeunet's Amelie, with a similar plot line involving 2 dysfunctional individuals seeking love -- both films with a ""dark"" subplot which threatens the central character's pursuit & realization of that union (Amelie w/the picture booth, PDL w/ the phone sex gang)...Some sort of masturbatory filmmaking by the ""in crowd"" of Hollywood, PDL seems more concerned with tooting its own horn & parading is ""artistry"" than building strong or remotely interesting narrative & characters... And I don't think that breaking genre coventions has to be a painful viewing experience.Where Amelie provided history & background to support the pathos of the leads & empathy, PDL provides none. The film is so cruel to Emily Watson's character, that it doesn't even give a clue as to her inexplicable attraction to Sandler's character, except maybe some sort of twisted autistic fetish (?!)The air is a bit too thick with pretense for my taste, and I just can't bring myself to contribute another laurel to Anderson's pile of collective hubris.",Punch-Drunk Love

It contains several unexpected ""jumpers"" (events that make you jump) and has a decent plot. There isn't much gore, but there are a lot of people who end up killed. There is no sex and very little foul language. The best way I can describe the movie is that it seemed like a cross between a Hitchcock thriller and PITCH BLACK. The film does have a few flaws, but if you watch the movie without any expectations, it will surprise you. Not a movie for those who like a lot of splatter and gore, but it is something that those with tamer tastes will probably enjoy.",N/A

755812,"""Gods and Generals"" could have used some tighter editing, just as many of the professional and online reviewers say. But some of their more hostile comments tell more about the reviewers than about the picture. World magazine writer Gene Edward Veith gigged them nicely with this mock content advisory:""Warning! This movie contains explicit Bible reading. Scenes contain graphic depictions of prayer. The language may not be suitable for viewers offended by nonprofane references to Jesus. Viewers are strongly cautioned due to intense moralizing, violently affectionate marriages, and gratuitous displays of selfless behavior.""It's hard to portray piety well on-screen, and Hollywood these days scarcely ever tries to do so. But Stephen Lang pulls it off. His Jackson is stern, warm, charismatic and convincing. I had long imagined a film about Stonewall, and this is almost all I could have desired.I had envisioned Ed Harris in the role, as he bears a strong resemblance to Jackson, but I don't think Harris could have outdone Lang or even equalled him. If you doubt Lang's acting chops, just watch him play Pickett in ""Gettysburg."" What a contrast to Lang's Jackson! Each portrayal has a life of its own. Lang's performance outdoes even the great Robert Duvall, who here and there lets the hint of a ""Lonesome Dove"" mannerism slip into his portrayal of Lee.""Gods and Generals"" is especially welcome in that it contains none of the puerile nonsense that spoiled the recent would-be epics ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""The Patriot."" Plodding it may be, but it should at least get credit for its maturity.Here's what I missed in ""Gods and Generals"" and hope to see in the 6-hour DVD when it is released next year:* Some sense of how Jackson and Lee earned their immense reputations, in the Valley campaign and at Second Manassas.* Some more attention to the Federal commanders, who were the tragicomic foils for Lee's and Jackson's brilliance. In the movie, that parade of bunglers and blowhards is represented only by Burnside. I understand the eventual 6-hour version will include Antietam, so we may meet McClellan there, but I want to see Pope and Hooker huff, puff and fall on their faces, too.* Speaking of bunglers and blowhards, a hard look at the secessionist firebrands who brought the war on might have mollified those critics who found the Southern cause way too idealized in this picture. Especially on the issue of slavery and race, a contrast could have been drawn between Jackson and someone like Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, who prattled about the ""great moral truth"" of white superiority. The South's bigotry resided in its politicians, not in men like Jackson. (One critic doubted that Jackson would ever have called the free black cook he hired ""Mr. Lewis,"" as he does in the movie. But ""Tom Fool"" Jackson was known in pre-war Lexington for tipping his hat to black men on the street. Said he: ""I could not be less polite to a Negro than he is to me."")I look forward eagerly to seeing the conclusion of Mr. Maxwell's Civil War trilogy. In the role of U.S. Grant, the Union general who finally took Lee's measure, I'd suggest Russell Crowe. Like Grant, Crowe looks a bit surly, ""as if he had determined to drive his forehead through a brick wall and was about to do it.""And if Crowe isn't available, just call on Lang again. Embodying Jackson, Pickett AND Grant --- now, THAT would be an acting trifecta!",N/A

A episode dubbed into Spanish is fascinating - even in another language, the evocative music, tumbling winds and black and white cinematography manage to create a creepy gothic mood.There are also vintage commercials featuring the Dark Shadows cast, from a Dark Shadows boardgame targeted to kids, goofy New Jersey PBS ads with Jonathon Frid (Barnabus Collins), to a cast member in a deodorant ad doing a ...

All of the original concepts get swept away in the fun of the musical numbers, and one thinks that the same actors, with the same music, could have had a more fitting script.  The keeping of the original dialog of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; was a bad choice, as lines so powerful and well-delivered by Katharine Hepburn (&quot;Put me in your pocket, Mike&quot;) come off silly and air brained from Grace Kelly.What really boosts &quot;High Society&quot; way up is Louis Armstrong.

531387,"Even though `The Contender' can be considered a take-off of the infamous Clinton scandal, there's many things that make it likeable; even for people who don`t appreciate politics.  Although you probably won't recognize most of the actors, the cast in its entirety is excellent.  With Jeff Bridges, Joan Allen and Christian Slater, the movie does offer some familiar faces.  But in my opinion, the show is simply stolen by Gary Oldman.  This is the first role I've ever seen him in; and it has since spawned my looking into his others.  Oldman is portrayed as the bad guy here (which makes him hard to like), but he does an excellent job.  There's also a good appearance by Sam Elliott, who co-starred with Bridges in `The Big Lebowski'.  He's a little rough around the edges, but his appearance still compliments the film.  And once you get past the extraordinary cast, there is actually a good movie.Joan Allen, the lone female present, has pretty much the starring role.  Women in politics is a touchy subject with many people; and this movie can certainly offend either way.  Allen (as Senator Laine Hanson) is selected to be the vice president of Bridges' character (known as the infamous ""Mr. President"").  The fact that she'd be the first woman ever in office turns a lot of heads and explodes into mass hysteria.  The film is a very good look at the corrupt side of politics; as Oldman (playing Rep. Shelly Runyon) and co. dig up whatever they can, truthful or not, about Senator Hanson.  That's where the title comes in.  The Senator is in fact a contender, as she fights off everything they throw at her.  The quote that Jeff Bridges uses (`they caught you being a human') sums it up perfectly; as things that seem morally wrong for politicians are acceptable for regular citizens.  The movie never really deals with the real aspects of political affairs.  It's only personal; which is what makes it watch-able for anyone not privy to political affairs.  A hidden treasure within the film is its subtle comedy.  Jeff Bridges provides most of the laughs; as he has an ongoing joke to see if his cooks will ever be out of some rare, unheard-of ingredient.  I particularly loved the part with the shark-steak sandwich.  I won't spoil the rest for you.  Also, the part when he cites his bowling average as 150 is great; though much more hilarious if you saw `The Big Lebowski'.  The greatest, and funniest quote of the movie comes from Joan Allen.  When compared to Clinton, she says `...[he's] not guilty, but responsible'.  That'll obviously bring out a laugh for everyone.The film does have a weird, slow start; but it picks up as it goes on.  `The Contender' is said to be a thriller, though nothing is really that thrilling.  It may be hard to enjoy for people who are expecting action or in-depth drama.  There is a continuing battle between the sides (good and bad), and nothing really unique takes shape.  Until the end.  I don't like to spoil movie endings or say too much about a movie; and I won't do that here.  I only gave this film 3 stars because it is very hard to ""get into"" what's happening.  But the acting is more than superb; mainly by Joan Allen.  I wouldn't say she is perfect, but she's not far from it.  The fact that she keeps things very personal makes her hard to figure out; which was intended, I`m sure.  Nevertheless, it's an excellent performance.  The slow start certainly knocks it down one star, and the ""Mr. President"" clich&eacute; is something we've seen far too many times.  The ending makes up for a lot though, and without it I would've gave the film only two stars.  But I do highly recommend `The Contender' to anyone.  As I've said, you don't have to be partial to politics in order to enjoy the film.  But then again... it certainly doesn't hurt.",N/A
505672,"There is another recent version of the Lolita story, starring Jeremy Irons. This one stars James Mason.I expected a character drama, but the first minutes quickly set me straight. This is a dark comedy. With that in mind, Kubrick's version of the famous story is highly enjoyable, if somewhat ham-fisted. It is mainly a comedy about cruelty : Humbert's cruelty towards Charlotte Haze, Lolita's mother, Humbert's cruelty towards Lolita, and Lolita's cruelty towards Humber.It is, of course, pathetic, and the opening scene (which chronologically is the ending) is a good display of that, as Humbert guns down a drunkard in his own house. Who that drunkard is, and why he is gunned down, is part and parcel of the whole story (albeit no one will have trouble seeing how it will all end after the first hour).Charlotte Haze: Whenever you touch me, darling, I go as limp as a noodle.Humbert Humbert: Yes, I am familiar with that feeling.",N/A
446863,"What most of you probably don't know is that this movie is ""very loosely"" based on a book by Stephen McCauley. In other words the book and the movie are very very different. I watched the movie first and liked it because I thought it was fairly original in that it was very different from any other romantic comedy I had ever seen before. It was only by complete accident that I later found out that this movie was inspired by a book. After reading the book, I went back and re-watched the movie, and thought to myself, this movie is an absolute insult to McCauley's book.The thing that I am most upset at the movie for is having Nina fall in love with George, because THIS NEVER HAPPENS IN THE BOOK. In the book Nina and George only love each other as friends and Nina never tries to seduce George like she does in the movie.There are many other huge differences between the book and the movie.  Like the fact that Paul, George's new love interest, is not an aspiring actor who lives with a critic named Rodney.  In the book, Paul lives in a small town in Vermont and is the writer of the town's newspaper. He also has a son named Gabriel, whom he adopted from a country in either South or Central America. It is not until George meets Paul and Gabriel that he agrees to help Nina raise her baby. What is really funny is that so much time has passed between the time that Nina originally asked George to help her raise the baby and the time that he accepts her proposal that by the time he tells her he wants to help her she has begun to think that her idea was not a very good one in the first place. She grudgingly accepts his offer to help her with the baby and basically tells him that she really doesn't expect this to be a permanent situation.In the movie Constance is Nina's stepsister, and in the book Constance is a somewhat mutual friend of Nina and Joley's. Nina and George do meet at Constance's party, and Joley does tell Nina that George needs a new place to live before he ever tells George that they are breaking up. However, in the movie George and Joley have been together for 4 years, and in the book they have been together for less than a year.In the movie George's brother, Frank, lives in New York and they have a pretty good relationship with each other. In fact, George is Frank's best man in his wedding. In the book, Frank lives in Boston and invites George and Nina to the wedding hoping that he can pass off Nina as George's girlfriend so that his fiancee and her conservative family will not find out that his brother is gay. When George and Nina arrive in Boston and Frank finds out that she is pregnant and cannot hide that fact he becomes very upset and demands that George and Nina make up a story that they were secretly married because of the baby. This offends George and he ends up not even attending his brother's wedding.In the movie, Vince is the father of Nina's child and is extremely resentful of her relationship with George. In the book, Howard is the name of Nina's boyfriend and she does not even meet him until after George has moved into her apartment. Howard and George become good friends and after Nina breaks up with Howard, George often remarks about how much he misses having Howard come to visit them. George also spends a good bit of the time trying to get Nina and Howard back on speaking terms with each other because he does not like it that Nina wants to exclude Howard from the raising of his child.I really don't understand why the movie producers bother to base a movie on a book when they have absolutely no intention of staying true to the book in any significant way.",Object of My Affection VHS
609331,"Real Women Have Curves (Patricia Cardoso, 2002)Seeing this one the same weekend the Oscars aired was a travesty. Thoroughly snubbed by the Oscars, this film, which won a large number of other awards (including Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival), stood head and shoulders above much of what there was to see, according to the Academy.The story centers around Ana, a teen just graduating from high school (America Ferrara, in her screen debut), her insane family, an English teacher who keeps encouraging her to go on to college, and one of her classmates, who's been worshipping her from afar all year. While the main point of the story (reflected in the title) is Ana's unwillingness to cave into her mother's (Lupe Ontiveros [Mi Familia, As Good As It Gets, etc.]) constant cracks about her weight, much of the subtext centers on the plight of first-generation immigrant families in America. Ana and her family have it relatively good, in a number of ways; Ana finagled herself a full scholarship to Beverly Hills high school, her sister (Ingrid Oliu, from Flatliners and Stand and Deliver) is an entrepreneur running her own business, even if it is a chronically-behind-on-its-orders sweatshop, her father has a good job, etc. etc. But, like most families who live day to day wondering when the wave that will push their heads under is coming, when sudden changes occur, the whole fragile network is flung into chaos. Always, in the background, Ana's mother is telling her to lose weight, and Ana responds by refusing to feel bad about it. (And here is where the story hits a slight snag in suspension of disbelief; no matter how good the actress, casting a girl who's maybe size 14-16 in such a role made me wonder if this movie would have ever gotten released were the main character really fat.)The whole thing is loud, chaotic, and fast-moving without ever going over the top, and in that it is truly distinguished. It makes the viewer feel good without manipulating the viewer into feeling good, and that is a very rare thing in American film these days. A minor, and completely overlooked, gem well worth searching out, and one of the ten best movies of 2002. ****",N/A
587251,"Betty is an annoyingly perky Hollywood hopeful. Rita is an amnesiac who crawls out of a limo involved in an accident - narrowly avoiding being murdered by its driver. The two meet when Rita sneaks into Betty's aunt's house and then fall in love.  With Betty and Rita turning into detectives in the Nancy-Drew mold, they uncover what may be clues to Rita's true identity. Betty balances her amateur detective work, new love life and her plans to star in a break-out role in the film, ""The Sylvia North Story"".  Meanwhile, a sinister cabal intimidates Adam Kesher, the film's luckless and spineless director into casting a starlet named Camilla for Betty's role. As Betty, who appears more blonde than Sandra Dee, feels her love for Rita deepen, she also gets closer to the truth about her amnesiac lover.  We learn a thing or two as well - in seemingly unconnected scenes showing the director's shadowy masters; a hitman who kills seemingly out of compulsion; a chillingly glib cowboy who may offer the director a way out; two guys shmoozing about nightmares in a restaurant; a monster hiding behind a parking lot; and a blue box....And then, it begins to go awry, with the illusions giving way to an entirely different existence for our characters. The scenes seem more dream like and illogical, but Lynch gives us more clues. And most importantly, the characters seem to change identities completely. The exotic yet meek Rita is now the much-desired Camilla, a Hollywood superstar who can live without Betty (or Diane). The much-desired Betty becomes the blowsy Diane, a one-time Hollywood hopeful whose dream ended when she lost the lead in ""The Sylvia North Story"" to Camilla. Although still dream-like, the latter part of the film is so bleak and dispiriting that we're supposed to think it a dream more routed in reality than the one the movie began with - with Betty's hopes and dreams becoming Diane's unachievable desires. Now, Camilla is Diane's former lover - an affair that Diane is incapable of maintaining even in her imagination (even the dream Camilla dumps Diane).  To underscore Diane's shame, Lynch reunites her with Camilla at dinner party at Adam Kesher's house where he and Camilla are about to announce their engagement).  The newer Kesher is stronger and more resilient the Kesher of Betty's world - even though they both dumped Betty/Diane for ""The Sylvia North"" story.  Diane's home (and her life) is an empty husk - she lives alone and never seems to leave, except when she brings a wad of cash and Camilla's picture to that hitman. Day becomes night, shrouding her in shadow as she sits listlessly on her couch, unable to even dream of an idealized version of her hopes.  Between the dreams of hope that open this flick and the nightmares of memories that won't die in the latter half, the characters seem menaced by a blue box. (IMNSHO, the box symbolizes TV, a wasteland for those who couldn't match their dreams for movie stardom - the big plot and character shift occurs when Rita opens the box, and is sucked inside; Because Lynch makes MD an obvious elegy to a lost Hollywood, TV becomes an obvious avatar of its demise and its character's pain).Though cryptic, ""Mulholland"" is not quite incomprehensible - it's more of a puzzle, and you and your friends can probably come up with dozens of your own spins on Lynch's loopy twists (and you should bring along a friend - loneliness becomes very palpable here).  ""Mulholland"" originally began as a TV mini-series, eventually morphing into a more ambitious project for TV.  It's unclear how much of the film's ""bicameral"" structure (the idea of splitting the plot into a dream and the ""real life"" that created it) originated before ""Mulholland"" made the leap to the big screen. Despite the film's consistently cryptic and creepy atmosphere, Lynch develops an emotional coherence that keeps you tied to the screen. Lynch brilliantly pulls this off at the dinner-party scene in which Kesher's family and friends hear of Diane's less-than-spectacular Hollywood adventures, and we learn of Diane's seemingly bottomless reservoir of pity (we see how unreachable Camilla has become to her, and this is also when we learn that it was Camilla who beat Diane to stardom). Lynch has managed to bring some of the pathos of &quot;The Straight Story&quot; to his trademark world of nightmares, cigarettes, mysterious strangers and all-nite-diners.",Mulholland Drive
669761,"Sally only got 2 Oscar noms, and won both. This seems to be the stock of lots of jokes. Fact is, with great writing, Ms. Field will knock your socks off, as she does here. I won't bother to rehash the plot, cuz you already know it, and it's phenomenal. Aside from the absolute attention to period detail, the acting is, without exception, superb. A previous reviewer noted that the cinematography of Nestor Almendros was sorely missing an Oscar nomination, and this is most correct. There were three films in 1984 about &quot;saving the farm&quot; (&quot;Country&quot;, &quot;The River&quot; and this); though &quot;Country&quot; was released earlier and got better reviews, this one came along and blew 'em all out of the water. This was Benton's autobiographical account of life during hard times, and it couldn't be more lovingly presented. Then, again, there's the acting: Lindsay Crouse, Danny Glover, John Malkovich, Terry O'Quinn, Amy Irving, Ed Harris, and two absolutely wonderful kid-actors, Yankton Hatton &amp; Gennie James. Howard Shore composed a score, not that original, with great help from the music icons of the period. It was very effective. The bottom line is that this is a very fine film, and mostly carried by the unwavering and confident performance of Sally Field. I like her. I really do.",N/A
544256,"This movie has all the ingredients to be witty, touching, and poignant, yet fails dismally across the board.  KISSING JESSICA STEIN could have been and should have been a funny story about a single woman's sexual confusion and frustration in an inherently confused and frustrated world, but instead we witness Jennifer Westfeldt giggling and ad libbing well beyond mere annoyance as the insecure Jessica Stein.  Heather Juergenesen, who co-wrote the script with Westfeldt, plays bisexual Helen Cooper with such ambivalence I felt she would have been more comfortable simply staying behind the typewriter.The story is contrived, the timing between the characters is off, and the ultimate demise of the relationship tacked on as a footnote ending is exasperating.  KISSING JESSICA STEIN had potential, then squandered it via unimaginative, one-dimensional, stereotypical storytelling.  Kind of like kissing a patch of drywall, but who would want to?",Kissing Jessica Stein
432709,"I remember seeing Halloween in a packed theatre when it was re-released in '79 and being on the edge of my seat.  Until the first Alien and Night of the Living Dead, a film has never scared me as much.  Well I can still say that Alien & Night are first-rate horror films.  I can no longer say the same about Halloween.  I'm not sure why this film now feels so hollow & rudimentary in places.  And the acting in this film is often terrible.  Except for Donald Pleasance, I think it's safe to say these girls needed a few lessons.  It's not completely their fault(the script is pretty bad and the screenplay draws the characters as if they were utter morons).  Carpenter has never seemed to direct actors well, especially his female actors, and it definitely shows in this film.  Halloween is virtually without gore but that was not a consideration for me when reviewing this film.  I  prefer suggestions of horror over gore, anyday.  In conclusion, if you're a first-time viewer and your expectations aren't too high, you may enjoy this.  It still retains a decent atmosphere of dread along with a few scares, I suppose.  But the film is no longer the fright classic so many of its defenders make it out to be.  I would recommend the two films I mentioned earlier over this: Alien & Night of the Living Dead.  Anyway, I gave the dvd 3 stars: 2 for the film and an extra star for the features & commentary.",N/A
101328,"Quentin Tarantino wrote the ultimate guy flick in the form of a romance movie, and then let Tony Scott polish it off with a bit of Hollywood sparkle. The resulting kitschy film comes off not so much a blockbuster epic, nor does it resemble a Tarantino-like piece of art. It just represents a sort of middle of the road movie that really could have been so much more, but still satisfies..Clarence is a loser, until he meets Alabama, a young prostitute hired to show him a good time for his birthday. The two fall in love, and what starts with Clarence killing her pimp to take back her stuff, results in a cross country chase with Clarence and Alabama toting half a million dollars of cocaine in a suitcase, with the mob and the police on their tail.The biggest draw of the movie is the star power, and more so the chemistry between certain actors and actresses in the many key scenes of the movie. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken play their cameos to the hilt, while Gary Oldman's performance as an urbanized white pimp absolutely steals the show in the first half of the movie. Up until Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette reach California, the movie remains dark, gritty, violent, and irreverent. But once the sunshine state hits, the slapstick-like comedy takes over, resulting in a shootout ending that doesn't so much make sense as it does distort the overall tone of the movie.You get the sense that no one really knows what the hell is going on, so each character acts their own way. This results in a strangely mesmerizing but disjointed movie experience, as the movie definitely shines and lulls in its given moments.But still, this movie is way smarter and more enjoyable than many other summer blockbusters that get tossed out there and deserved more acclaim in its 1993 debut than it originally received.",N/A

James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) tries to save the world from a super North Korean villain (Rick Yune) who wants to use lasers to bring destruction.

605499,"There aren't enough words that I can come up with to say how amazing that ""Chicago"" really is. This movie, actually a musical, is a stunning array of music, amazing dancing acts, great storylines, and a whole sense of fun woven into the dark and dramatic theme of this movie. There haven't been many musicals in recent years due to the lack of popularity during recent times and naturally, I'm not a big fan of musicals but I think that Chicago brings new life into this genre of movies and has paved the way to bringing musicals back into the front spotlight again for the new generations of movie-goers. DANGER: Possible spoilers ahead, hopefully not.Set in the Jazz Age of the early 1920s, Al Capone was rising to become the notorious Prohibition Era gangster leader, and new fashion trends were causing an uproar. Outside the shadow of Capone's looming shadow, this movie is a tale of two well known dancers who are suspected of killing their husbands after an affair. Roxie Art, who faces possible execution for murdering her abusive boyfriend who constantly rejected her and her estranged husband Amos refused to take blame for it, seeks a money hungry, never-lost-a-case lawyer named William Flynn played by Richard Gere to win her freedom and also her road to stardom and to flee from her estranged husband Amos.The songs that accompany the individual events are so much fun to listen to, combined with the dancing performances by the individual characters. Personally, I love the Big Band and ragtime music that accompanies the movie scenes and the performers and stage performances are amazing. All of the characters in ""Chicago"" are amazing but for me, it's a toss up between Queen Latifah as Matron ""Mama"" Morton, Catherine Zeta Jones as Velma Kelley, and Richard Gere as William Flynn. Except for Flynn who is their lawyer, they are all charged with the murders of their `loved' ones who have been unfaithful to them and their desire for revenge drove them to madness. All of the songs that accompany each of the scenarios are innovative and absolute brilliance. The entire cast surpassed all of my expectations in this musical and gave them a whole new image of skill, intelligence, and depth to their characters. I love also seeing the movie flip between the dramatic scenes of Roxie in prison and then the stage performances.Queen Latifah steals part of the spotlight as the elegant Matron ""Mama"" Morton. Morton offers Roxie Art a deal to get $3K to a lawyer by the name of William `Billy' Flynn who has `never lost a trial' to testify in her favor. Her ruthless `drill sergeant' attitude is classic and sometimes even funny although its humor factor is basically from the big band music that plays along during the scenes. Latifah's vocals are astounding. There's a funny yet good message in her song too. The other half of the spotlight is stolen by Catherine Zeta Jones. Velma Kelley play by Jones is also jailed for murdering two people, though it took place before ""Chicago"" started. Her manipulative personality brings a large amount of conflict to the musical, not to mention a sense of mystery. I've heard a lot about that Catherine was a dancer for many years and Between Jones and Zellweger, it's obvious for many years and had all the skills needed whereas Zellweger definitely showed a bit of newbie performances but still both are great. Velma is an incredible character too and Zeta Jones is a wonderful singer in this film. As Roxie gains the fame that she has longed for though, Velma is forgotten by many and a bitter rivalry ensues between them. Yes, Roxie is a great dancer but isn't anywhere close to Velma's dancing skills in my opinion. Richard Gere though is another standout as the semi-sleazy lawyer Flynn who seems to get the women characters nuts over him. I must honestly say, I never thought that Richard Gere could sing but man, he can SING. I would even say that Richard Gere can sing even better than a lot of commercial pop singers in the radio I must add. ;) My favorite scene was William Flynn performing the puppet scene and also Amos singing his song about him being rejected by his wife and being overlooked by the general public called ""Mr. Cellophane"".This movie was nominated for a whopping13 Academy Awards for every category except for Best Actor, and won 3 Golden Globes. ""Chicago"" got its justice with the numerous nominations as it's one of the best musicals to ever come to the big screen in modern times, considering how `out-of-fashion' it seemed immediately before ""Moulin Rouge"" came along last year and brought musicals back to life for a new generation of musical fans for the new generation and for the generations of the 21st century. Maybe ""Chicago"" might have been somewhat overhyped but, it's rare that I say this but, it lived up to the hype that surrounded it and is destined to become a classic in the near future.  For some extra trivia, I myself am native to Chicago and I guess for this reason this movie means so much more to me than it would've otherwise had I not been a Native Chicagoan. Go and see this movie before it's too late as it won't have anywhere near the punch on the small screen like it did the on the movie theatre.",Chicago

615259,"I've recently got around to seeing this latest addition to the zombie film genre- and I must say I was thrilled by many of the aspects of the film, especially the direction, acting etc. But one thing that really irked me is there were many blatant references to the Living Dead trilogy, and I don't know whether to take those into account with the rating of this review. At least five or six plot points coincided with ""Dawn of the Dead"" especially, and Romero in my mind may want to sue for royalties. Unfortunately, as is with the case of many films, cds, etc, the younger generation will not recognize these references, and be possibly left out at discovering the genius of the likes of George Romero. The ending is another point of scorn with me, I found it unsatisfying and anticlimatic, and would have preferred something a bit less predictable from Hollywood standards. Overall this would receive 2 and a half stars from me.",28 Days Later

It is here where the series begins to try to dish up more details on Freddy's past to add to the story; but hardly anything can save this dismal installment.  Freddy's one liners are stupid and aren't funny one bit, the acting is simply horrid (Robert Englund just looks more bored in his role than ever before), and the film as a whole isn't scary one bit.

771928,"It's about time those people at ADV Films got their act together and released season two all together. Am I the only one confused by all those volumes? This is the way it should be seen and bought. I have been watching the reruns of this show and I am now up to season 4. Looking back on Season two their are plenty of great high light episodes that come to mind. This is where Johns obsession with worm holes really starts to grow. It's also when he gets the scorpious chip put inside his head. This season has the best cliff hanger of the first three seasons, I have yet to see how season 4 ends.It's interesting to note that ""Dream a little dream"" was the original first episode. But SciFi thought it did not address the issues of the cliff hanger of season 1 so instead it began with ""Mind the Baby"". This season starts off pretty rocky as ""Dream a little dream"" and ""Taking the Stone"" are pretty weak episodes. It always takes a few episodes for a farscape season to get warmed up. But once your in you are treated to such great episodes as;""The Way, We weren't"": Great background story on Pilot, Moya, and Aeryn,""My Three Crichtons"": Great acting by Ben Browder as he plays three versions of himself.""The Locket"":Seeing Aeryn and John grow old together brings a tear to my eye.and ""A Clockwork Nebari"":I don't think TV has ever been so graphic. Great work by Henson and Co.This season contains the worst three parter of the entire series, with the ""Look at the Princess"" trilogy and the best three parter of the series with the ""Liars, Guns, and Money"" trilogy.The work done by The Jim Henson company must be seen to be believed, I am glad I at least caught the show now, better late than never, and I hope to see a movie sometime in the near future. It's a testament to what SciFi should be and really raises the bar for television.The Cliff Hanger was brilliant, and the acting by the entire cast is superb.

755997,"Combining plot elements reminiscent of Tolkien and the Arthurian legends, writing that's rarely been equalled, characters you actually care about, an epic story spanning ages and generations, and still with more believability per frame than most non-SF dramas, B5 is in a class of its own.Like some others here, I'm replacing my tapes with DVD's as they are released. The ability to quickly visit any scene from any show easily justifies the extra cost.Season three is where most B5 fans got hooked - I know I did. I watched season one on and off. With season two, I found myself watching more. By the time the story arc began to unfold in season two, I was watching every week. By season three, watching every week's episode had taken on the nature of an almost spiritual imperative. Unlike some here, I don't necessarily consider season four a close second, but pretty much equal to season three.B5 broke so much new ground, it's hard to list it all. It certainly was one of the first to show bad things happening to good characters. It took the bold step of letting you believe for years that certain characters were good (or bad), when they might turn out to be much more complex in the end. The characters become so real to us that I've seen grown men choke back their emotions when a character you only saw in a robotic suit incapable of expressing emotion get killed. B5 was a pioneer in admitting to and exploring issues of faith even though its creator and writer is an avowed atheist.Even in its portrayal of relationships, romantic and otherwise, it was unique. Everywhere else on TV, characters were introduced in act 1, in bed by act 3, and forgotten by next season. As in real life, this also happened on B5, but you also got a chance to savor the growth of relationships you could never hope to see on episodic TV. B5 had its share of great love stories but they were never formulaic. Two were cut short by tragedy, but one of those was never consummated while the other grew from a one-night stand with political motives. You even saw people who were close and had some obvious attraction, but chose for various good reasons not to act on those feelings. Based on perhaps limited experience, these people seem more real and interesting to me than most I see on TV.At a time when most entertainment teaches few positive values, B5 celebrates commitment to a greater cause. It balances this with cautionary tales that suggest we be constantly vigilant that our cause is really just. It teaches self-sacrifice. Simply watching most episodes of B5 is like a workout for your conscience. It makes you think. The characters themselves think. It taught that victories aren't always won by violence and that the only persistent peace is achieved through conscience, commitment, and determination.",N/A

26555,"I have a problem with Criterion charging an arm and a leg for their DVD's when so many of them are released with little more than bare bones in the way of extra features.  The company's issue of this classic thriller from director Stanley Donen, ""Charade"" is no exception.  Plot wise: Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) returns home to discover that her apartment has been cleaned out, her husband is dead and that she was married to a double agent who had embezzled a ton of money. Into this mix comes the mysterious, savy stranger with too many names played by Cary Grant.  He is determined to put Regina's mind at ease but is he or isn't he working for the same men who killed Regina's husband.  Also in the cast, James Coburn and Walter Matthau in an uncharacteristically serious role.""Charade"" is a classic in every sense of the word, but Criterion has done a rather lack luster job on mastering the DVD.  Although colors are exceptionally vibrant and sharp, there is a considerable amount of edge enhancement and fine shimmering that is detected in horizontal and vertical details. Also, while ""Charade"" is presented in its widescreen aspect ratio, this disc has not been enhanced to take full advantage of hi-resolution, widescreen televisions.  In the way of extras we get a bio on Stanley Donen that you can (of all things) read like an essay by using your advance buttons on your DVD player. (Really, I don't know of a single individual who reads extensively from their television screen)and a theatrical trailer.  That's it.  Criterion's packaging makes it sound like RSDL DVD engineering is a big plus but actually all DVD's are mastered in this format.  Criterion as advertises the film as being offered in a ""pristine new digital transfer"".  The actual transfer falls short of this high praise.  What Criterion really needs to do is get studio approval from the company that produced the film and then do a definitive documentary on the making-of, if they really want their Canadian consumers to shell out [$$$]for their movies.

He also, along with his brother Danny, makes very interesting films out of a studio in Hong Kong. First coming to Western attention with the crime thriller Bangkok Dangerous a few years ago, the twins came up with a horror film this time. And it's one of the best horror films to come down the pike in a long time.Mun, a blind girl (Angelica Lee, who caught Western attention a couple of years back in Betelnut Beauty), has a cornea transplant to restore her sight. While in the process of recovery, she starts seeing things that don't quite gel with reality. After she regains focus, she comes to realize what she's seeing is not exactly what's out there. Not just ghosts (though the movie has its share of those, a la The Sixth Sense), but places and things that aren't actually around her. Her therapist, Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou, not familiar to Western audiences yet. Give him time), half thinks she's nuts, half wants to get her into bed, so he goes along with her attempts to track down the donor of her corneas and find out what happened to the person.Slick, eerie, and chock full of tension, The Eye is exactly what thrillers are supposed to be. There is a lot of The Sixth Sense in this movie, but the punches are delivered more deftly; the movie contains the best jump-out-of-your-seat scene since the cat came flying through the window at the beginning of Friday the 13th Part 2 twenty years ago. Asian directors also seem immune to the silly emotionally manipulative tricks American directors are so fond of pulling, and the Pang brothers are no exception; they have a story, they want to tell it, and the emotion will come out (though sometimes awkwardly, as when Wah's uncle confronts him about his intentions towards Mun).Apart from such unintentionally funny moments as this, The Eye is a wonderful little supernatural thriller. Very highly recommended. ****",The Eye

716478,"&quot;I've never seen anything like it!&quot; -That must be the most said line in the film!  To be honest I've never seen anything like it either, well maybe a little like it.  Right before Director John &quot;Bud&quot; Carlos teamed with Tobe Hooper for &quot;The Dark&quot; (1979) he blessed the cheezy b horror film genre with this little number from 1977.  The story, penned by the writer who gave us &quot;Village of the Giants&quot; (1965) &amp; &quot;Evil Knievel&quot; (1971) as well as the co-writer of a western starring Kenny Rogers!, concerns a small desert farm town being overrun by extremely hungry and ill-tempered tarantulas.  William Shatner leads the cast as Rack Hansen, the town vet with a cowboy hat.  Woody Strode (Draba from Spartacus) plays local farmer Walter Colby who begins losing his livestock to the horrible poisonous spiders! This one has many alluring elements:  Cheese, people being attacked by tarantulas and totally flipping out, country music, thousands of real tarantulas, webs, Shatner not only talking like a cowboy, but also reacting to vicious man-eating spiders like only he could!  Actually, he's not as over the top as Captain Kirk, but like Kirk, Rack manages to put moves on a female amidst all the terror! Definitely recommended for fans of Shatner and of &quot;the town is being taken over by...&quot; movies.The 2002 Goodtimes DVD is impressive for this film.  I rented this on VHS at a video store that doesn't exist anymore and no one else has it. Imagine my surprise when I saw it on DVD! The film is presented in a Standard screen version only with chapter selection, not to mention great keep case art - Shatner kneeling over a woman covered in spiders!  The DVD is inexpensive as Goodtimes DVDs are and if you like it or even think you will, I can recommend it for purchase.  The image transfer isn't perfect (there's the odd jump that's in the orginal film most likely), but face it, its not getting any better than this.  We're lucky to have it on digital at all!  Check out that last shot when Shatner prys the boards off the window and looks out onto the town! Also recommended: Devil's Rain (1975) - Shatner vs. cloaked devil worshipper Ernest Borgnine!  Also a DVD cheapie.  Film debut of John Travolta as Danny, the eyeless &amp; mute devil worshipper!  Tom Skerrit and Eddie Albert decide to join the fight against evil as well!

111768,"After having watched ""Casablanca"" for the first time, it has become quite clear to me why the period from the 1940's through the 1950's was considered Hollywood's 'Golden Era'.  I suspect that is was still the relative newness of the medium that enabled movies of this period to be of such high quality, a quality lacking in almost all of today's films.  During that period, gratuitous sex and violence were not permissible and there were no special effects to distract the audience from a poor story.  As a result, the way directors were able to engross the audiences in their films was by telling compelling stories and developing their characters with great depth and care.  These movies also involved some of quickest, sharpest, wittiest dialogue ever committed to the big screen.  The only director today who shows any understanding of the importance of clever and intelligent dialogue is Quentin Tarantino, but he makes overly violent movies and only makes about one film every 5 years.""Casablanca"" may be the pantheon of the 'Golden Era'.  It is easily one of the most quoted movies in cinematic history and it has some the most memorable scenes.  For anyone who has not actually seen the movie, the plot centers on French Morocco during World War II in the city of Casablanca.  The fear of the German war machine drives people to Casablanca to seek any form of passage to the United States.  Business is fertile for men possessing the exit visas to get people across the Atlantic.  Much of the business takes place at Rick's Cafe Americain, run by a jaded Rick Blaine (played masterfully by the legendary Humphrey Bogart).  He was idealistic in his younger days, but now is a cynic and only helps people when it benefits him.  His world gets turned upside down when the former love of his life Isla (played by the luminous Ingrid Bergman) enters the Cafe with her husband, the revolutionary leader Victor Lazlo, looking for passage to the States.  It evokes one of the greatest lines in cinematic history and sets in motion series of events involving intrigue, passion, and suspense.The wordplay between Bogart's Rick and any one of the other characters is true treat to behold.  It is sharp and witty and seems so perfectly timed.  The only other movie I have ever seen that comes close to this level of dialogue is the old Cary Grant film ""His Girl Friday"".  Rick's enigmatic moods always leave the viewer wondering what path he'll choose.  Will it be the one of selfish interest or the one of greater good?  The viewer never knows until the very end.  Bergman's Ilsa is one of the most beautiful female characters in the history of film.  Bergman's beauty would be just as captivating today as it was back in the 1940's.  The passion of lost love between Ilsa and Rick is largely unspoken, but it's very palpable.  Unlike today's films, which feel the need show too much, ""Casablanca"" uses subtlety to convey the emotion and passion.""Casablanca"" is considered a violent movie without ever being too violent.  The threat of the German 'Gestapo' hanging over every action and every scene creates a tension, a fear, and a suspense that few movies can match.There is not one single wasted motion, scene, or character in this film.  There is purpose in everything that happens.  Characters from the shifty street vendor all the way to the shady Captain Renault have purpose and meaning.  ""Casablanca"" has been termed by some to be the 'perfect film'.  That's a lofty claim as some of the movies that were thought to be great in their time, now prove to be dated and almost a parody of themselves (""2001"" and ""The Graduate"") are classic examples.  ""Casablanca"", however, earns that praise and proves to be a timeless classic that is as moving today as it was in 1942.",N/A
303114,"Ohhhh, this is a good one.  The magnificent dueling performances by Ethan Embry and Ed O'Neill keep you glued to the screen like you're watching some crackerjack tennis match as the two battle back and forth.Ed O'Neill plays Dutch, a wealthy professional who feels more at ease wearing a softened pair of corduroy pants while drinking a beer and eating pretzels than he does seeing an opera or visiting the local country club.  He falls for JoBeth Williams' character, Natalie, the divorcee to a rich, snobby businessman -- the same man who has managed to turn their son Doyle against her.  Knowing that he's going to ""pop the question"" soon, Dutch volunteers to go to Doyle's ritzy boarding school in Georgia to bring him home via car for the Thanksgiving holiday.  By doing so, he's hoping that they will have a unique chance to bond and that the boy will be more loving to his mother.Ohhhhh, Dutch....what were you thinking??  It's a nightmare!!  From the moment they meet, the two are battling at every level.  Ethan Embry is OUTSTANDING as Dobsy (errr, Dwayne...uhmm, no....Digby?).  He plays the part of the spoiled rich brat to perfection.  Their funny misadventures on the road home put them in all sorts of hilarious situations...from losing their car in a freak ""accident"" to hitchhiking a ride with some hookers to spending the night at a homeless shelter.  It keeps getting funnier with every turn. Ed O'Neill takes Dutch to a whole new level with his calm, cool collectedness.  He displays incredible control of his character and you'll just be cheering for the guy the whole time.The touching moments are when we see Doyle by himself, contemplating his attitude about life and his family.  When he thinks no one is watching, Doyle is surprisingly sensitive and not so much the young adult who probably has a stock ticker in his closet...he's just a lost, struggling teenager who's as vulnerable as the rest of us.But the ultimate question is...will Dutch succeed in winning Doyle over?  You'll just have to watch and see for yourself!",N/A
689450,"If Sylvia Kristel had acted in this it probably would have been more entertaining, since she doesn't mind doing a sex scene or two. Laura Gemser, on the other hand, was plenty nude in this film (about every 5 minutes or so), but she has nothing even remotely close to a ""sex scene"". What gives? She gets touchy feely on a few occasions, but nothing special. Maybe that's why they had to call her ""Emanuelle"" with one M, instead of Sylvia Kristel's ""Emmanuelle"", because the extra M means MORE sex.That's okay, because there was plenty of sex to be had by everyone else, even the horse! Contrary to the review from ""dirk digler"", Laura did not have anything to do with the horse, and nobody had sex with it. Some lady just massaged its genitalia. Big deal.There is a scene at a party which turns into an explicit pornographic orgy and, later, when Laura is out and about taking pictures of people having sex for some reason, they are all engaged in explicit, real behavior. So that makes up for Laura's lack of ""getting it on"", but her soft-core stuff would've been silly compared to what else was going on, anyway.Now, the ""snuff"" stuff.....I'll admit, it was quite troubling to watch at first, until I heard in a commentary how the director scratched up some 8mm film he shot the scenes with to make it look grainy and real. His efforts paid off, as far as realism goes. I honestly couldn't tell if it was fake or not at first, until one of the ""victims"" (the torn breast girl) didn't quite convince me that she was being tormented. But the meathook? How could you fake that? Even if it is fake, it still is creepy to watch. Definitely effective cinema, if nothing else.",N/A

I am so glad that a friend lent it to me so I could see it wasn't worth it. Wish I could get the time I wasted watching this overhyped and overrated film back!

613970,"Who would expect that a movie based on a ride at Disney World would make a good movie. It could've been terrible if it wasn't done right. It was done right though, has a great cast, good direction, nice special effects and great action. The script is just a little weak though. With lesser actors this movie might not have worked. I do see that's it's a little silly to have sword fight after sword fight with pirates that can't be killed though. I guess they think if they cut off enough limbs they won't be able to fight back anymore.Johny Depp is so much fun that it's easy to over-look that it's silly to fight un-dead pirates. His character and performance could've made even Cuthroat Island a good movie. Hell maybe even Muppet Treasure Island lol. His character is odd and totally original. He's an excellent actor don't know he has never been nominated. He adds much needed wit to the movie as does Geoffrey Rush as the cursed villain. Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) and  Keira Knightley play it straight but are still strong in their roles. Orlanda Bloom is well on his way to being a big action star. Too bad he wasn't around in 1991 because he would've made a better Robin Hood than Kevin Costner. I hear their might be sequels, as long as Johny Depp comes back as Captain Jack Sparrow...I say bring them on. As for making more movies based on Disney rides. I don't think we really need Space Mountain the movie lol. They're lucky that Pirates of the Carribean even turned out to be good but that's because it had a  good cast and direction.",Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl

I'm buying it for him for Christmas and I was so pleased to see that it had come out on DVD. This is such a heartwarming and hilarious film. It's definately one of my favorites.It tells the story of a man named Elwood P. Dowd who loves to drink, but it doesn't affect his friendly personality. Meanwhile, his sister and niece find him an embarrassing nuicance who is standing in the way of his niece, Myrtle May's, introduction into high-class society. However, Elwood seems oblivious to their behavior towards him and never has anything but a kind word for anyone. Everyone outside his family seems to adore him and his family would love him too if it wasn't for his best friend. A best friend that no one can see. Except Elwood. A 6-foot-tall white rabbit named Harvey. As Elwood goes throughout his day, inviting bums from bars back to their fancy home for dinner, buying people he doesn't even know countless drinks, and giving them his card before introducing them to Harvey, his sister finally decides that that's the last straw and she decides to get rid of him. So she goes to a mental institution to begin the process of having him admitted. And that's where all their problems really begin...This is a wonderful movie that my entire family makes a ritual of watching at least a couple times a year.

714753,"Hollywood doesn't do very well when it comes to making movies about families that people actually enjoy watching. To paraphrase Bruce Campbell, I think it's all the spores that are effecting the brains of the L.A. sub-culture. So when a wonderful little movie like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING comes along and ends up breaking all kinds of records and earning tons of money, it really shouldn't be any surprise to anyone. I saw this movie in the theatre three weeks before the video came out and it was the hardest I've laughed in a movie theatre since last fall.Now granted, the plot of the movie is true to formula, perhaps even unoriginal. Also granted that many members of Toula's (Nia Vardalos) family come of as loud and obnoxious and that the film is full of stereotypes. With that all said, the film works exceedingly well and is hilarious to watch.The movie works so well because the characters in the film are so real and believable. Some find this hard to believe because they've really never been a part of a family. However, for anyone who is a part of a family (whether from a large one like Toula; a small one like Ian; or somewhere in the middle) this film is sure to strike a positive cord.MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING is a great comedy because it knows just what type of movie it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's a very real film; one that most people can relate to in some form or fashion. Of course it's formulaic, because that's the way life is--you know the whole circle of life thing.I understand that there are some people who don't like the movie very much. However, I don't understand why there are so many people who have given this film a negative review at Amazon[.com]. Do you people actually do any real living?As a side note, kudos to Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson for helping bring this picture to the big screen. It just goes to show just how talented of a guy Hanks is; not only is he the best actor in Hollywood, he's also a decent director, and now he's got a really successful credit as producer under his belt as well.",N/A
155941,"The Fog isn't that old--1980--yet it seems like they can't even pull this kind of movie off today anymore.It's basically an old fashioned ghost story about revenge on a town. Antonio Bay is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its founding. Old timers tell the story of ""the fog"", which rolled in one night as the settlers of Antonio Bat lead a leper ship into jagged rocks on purpose, straying the ship off-course with a campfire on shore.Sure enough, the fog rolls in, bringing with it shadowy figures in period garb. And that's one of the great qualities of The Fog. The ghosts are ghostly, period, and we never really get a good look at any one of them. Only once do we get any real gore, with a green-blooded arm being hacked off. But overall the mist and the faintly glowing eyes still work pretty well. It's a strength of the film that we don't get the overboard cheap scare tactics. Carpenter doesn't need it as he creates the perfect spooky atmosphere with smoke and lights and music.I value atomosphere very highly in a horror film, and The Fog is full of a sense of foreboding. The camera work is excellent as is the lighting; something tells me an updated Hollywood version would kill the subtlety at play here. The dark sets and even the dated FX shots of the fog coming in off the bay look great on this DVD. I have to give MGM credit on this job. The film looks fine enough, and most important, we get some nice extras and attention to detail. Even the animated menus are a treat.  One reviewer in these pages did write about the film quality though, claiming that the colors were very off, changing the effect of the film. This may be true (wouldn't surprise me the way they do some DVD transers) but I think the film is sharp on this release, and most people may not take notice.This is highly recommended, period. For Carpenter fans, for fans of old fashioned ghost stories updated in a competent way. The soundtrack is recommended as well, especially for Carpenter fans. Hypnotic, simple piano riffs that match the moody colors and the characters of the film.",N/A

The movie begins as a young Jean-Michel Basquiat witnesses a painting of some sort on a wall.  Basquiat's mother (I presume) begins to cry, but then she looks down at Basquiat who is smiling as we see an image of a halo or a crown.  Maybe this is a prelude of what is about to come for her young son?  Throughout the film we see various images of a surfer surfing the ocean.  This can relate to a young up-and-coming artist in Basquiat who climbs the latter of success; rides the waves, and of course we see his perpetual and painfull downfall.  He learns many things along the way, especially that success comes with a price.  He can never shake the negative reviews that he was &quot;Warhol's hanger-on,&quot; or a &quot;Graffiti writer.&quot;  We never really know what's going on in Basquiat's head or what's fueling his artistic fire, and why he flirts with danger.  By the time that we make a pretty good asumption, again we see the image of the surfer surfing the ocean, only this time he falls and is swallowed by the waves.  A lot of questions left unanswered, but this won't matter because with such an oustanding cast - it covers any holes that this film may have.

Tony Levin's tour photographs are a wonderful addition, as is &quot;The Story of Growing Up.&quot;But the real showcase is the show itself, peppered with astounding visual treats and classic songs.You can offer as much nit-picky criticism as you want about Peter Gabriel, but I say he is one of the world's finest and most consistently fascinating musicians.Growing Up Live is well worth the price -- especially if you were there, watching the show unfold.Highest recommendation!",N/A
748992,"For Clooney&#65533;s debut direction, I would say that Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was very impressive and worth seeing. For his first time, I&#65533;d say he picked a difficult project. But it definitely did not show. It was like George had been doing this for years. His acting is always superb, but put that with phenomenal directing as well, and what you&#65533;ve got is an all-around good movie. An excellent casting for Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) results in a film that will make you laugh and also keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie is based on Barris&#65533; autobiography, about television producing, sex, and CIA assassinating jobs. Barris is a sex-crazed man who stumbled upon the up and coming television business. When his first pilot is cancelled, he is really down on his luck and out of work too. Luckily, a CIA agent (George Clooney) recruits him to be a top secret assassin who travels all around the world to kill people that America &#65533;doesn&#65533;t like&#65533;. The story gets more complex and interesting and most definitely keeps your interest. Assuming that the story is not completely true (but hey, who knows) it makes for a good lot of entertainment, with laughs and suspense. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, however I can see that this movie is not for everyone, but check it out and see, you never know!",Confessions of a Dangerous Mind

751121,"The Guru is a little film that snuck up in theaters during the bleak month of Janurary that offered a colorful and fun filled comedy romp about sex.  I have to admit, I had fun watching this movie.  The first time seeing it I really didn't laugh too much, just smiled a lot.  A few weeks later one of my friends hadn't seen it so I agreed to go watch it again.  I must say I laughed very hard the second time around.The comedy gets better once you can fully appreciate how good some of the performances are.  Merissa Tomei was SO FUNNY in this.  When I saw Anger Management, which she was also in, I was so angry at the film's creators for not making more use of her! She really shows her excellent comedic ablities in The Guru.  It's amazing to think of her in dramatic roles (In the Bedroom for example), because she's a fine actress in them, but this is a total turn around for her.  She can play practically anything.The other actors do a good job as well.  I especially like Christine Branaski as the upper class snob mother.  She was a hoot.  The cast is nice all around.The major complaint I have is with the finale.  Was it cute?  Yes.  Was it sweet?  Yes.  Did it belong in The Guru?  NO!  For a movie so creative, funny, and original (its not in every movie indian dancers belt out songs from Grease in Bollywood fashion), that the cliche ""catch the girl and stop the wedding"" finale simply did not fit.  I would have liked an ending that could live up to the rest of the movie.I also admired that the film didn't have to rely on gross out sex gags.  It is a sex comedy, but with wit and sophistocation.Now, overall, The Guru is an enjoyable film that I like more each time I watch.  I reccommend it as an interesting rental, however I liked it enough to purchase it.  See for yourself what The Guru of sex has to offer!",N/A

Truly a movie for all ages.  I absolutely love Danny Elfman's songs in this film - haunting, yet empathic.  This movie is not as boisterous as Beetlejuice, but is more subtle in it's message, like Edward Scissorhands.  Kids will love the fun characters and music; as an adult I love the artistic rendering that has been given to the set, characters, and music.  Where stop-motion animation is concerned, it is, technically, by far the best ever made to date.  The movement is very fluid, not at all like the Christmas classics I grew up with.  I am surprised by how many people I have met who have never seen this movie- in our household, it is not only a semi-annual tradition (shown on both Hallowe'en and Christmas) but is also a day-to-day favorite, good for viewing anytime you want to watch a fun film.

758020,"'IRREVERSIBLE' starts as an attack on what film ""should"" be with credits running in reverse, sliding around, and at the end of the film.  The effect here is less for the cool factor (as it is in the film 'SEVEN') and more to disrupt audience levels of acceptability.  In fact, the whole film pushes the audience to question what is ""acceptable"" and what is not.  This is not exploitation, however, but aggressive art, art which is meant to challange, provoke, and stay with you long after the film is over.The plot has been discussed elsewhere so I won't harp on that.  Needless to say, the film starts in a circle in Dante's Hell, moves upward through a Purgatorio, and almost, but not quite, gets to Heaven.  But the film is told in reverse.  ""Time destroys all"" is the motto, and indeed, because ""Heaven"" is at the beginning and ""Hell"" at the end, the film isn't a romantic parable on coincidence but rather an essay on/for/in search of Nihilism; Nihilism is tragic, Hence, this film is a tragedy. It's best if the film is viewed as a Horror/Love/Pro-Feminist story.The acting in the film is as perfect as the deft camerawork/cinematography.  Monica Bellucci should especially be praised for taking on what is surely one of the most difficult scenes any actress has been asked to perform on film.  The infamous rape is done with such artistry and integrity that it is never sensational & exploitative; The violence is always real and vivid, never forgettable, and is (the violence) far above and beyond the frivolous ""human bodies as toys/trash"" shown in films like 'GLADIATOR' and 'TERMINATOR 3'.  Here, violence is never romantic nor chic and for this Noe deserves any and all credit he gets.This film is along the same in-your-face, intellectual horror films as 'SALO: 120 DAYS OF SODOM', 'VIDEODROME' and 'HELLRAISER', films where the killer is not some masked voyeur but rather the ""Killer"" is time, destiny, circumstance, and the human disposition towards violence as it fulfills personal/political/psychological desires & a need to transgress.For a better understanding/appreciation of 'IRREVERSIBLE'check out the above mentioned but also give a read to Georges Bataille's ""EROTISME"" and ""THE TORTURE GARDEN"" by Octave Mirabeau (also some Maurice Blanchot wouldn't be bad).I give the film 4.75 but not 5 because Noe hasn't quite made his masterpiece...but he's very, very close.  While not a film for everyone, if you can mentally & physically handle 'IRREVERSIBLE' you'll experience what art can & ""should"" be.  This film will be studied and discussed for many years to come.",N/A

One bad thing after another happens to him (gang attacked, missed out on a promotion, dog with a bladder the size of a swimming pool).  He snaps and goes on a verbal rampage against God.God (played very well by Morgan Freeman) calls him out and gives him His power to see if he can do it any better.After paying too much attention to his own needs and vengeance, he starts to realize it's a bigger job than he thought.The movie doesn't dwell too much into the religious side of the storyline.  It's more of a ""knowing what a miracle really is"" and ""what free will means"" angle.Jennifer Aniston plays Jim's very sexy girlfriend.  About the only thing that didn't make sense is how naive her character is by not reacting to the odd things that happen the way most of us would.  Example: (as seen in the commercial) opening the bathroom door to see their dog sitting on the toilet taking a dump and reading the newspaper.  Her facial expression is a bit too ""whatever.."".Movie warnings: profanity, overdramatic orgasms, monkey probing, and Jim singing 'What If God Was One Of Us'.  :)Worth the matinee and evening ticket prices.

38220,"I definitely agree with the reviewers who say that P.T. Anderson's Magnolia is extraordinarily self-indulgent. That fact, however, does little to diminish the quality of the film. It's a long, overly ambitious film that will test most viewers' patience and others' tolerance for bloated grandiosity. The film sharply divides movie fans as it very well should.Paul Thomas Anderson would do well to attain a bit of subtlety, but he is undeniably a very good filmmaker. My biggest complaint against Magnolia is the tendency of the stars to overact - and overact they do. Nearly everyone in the film at some point gets to cry and shout ""I hate you! I (f-word) hate you!"" to someone else. When they're not overacting, though, the performances are very good. Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly and Melora Walters particularly stick out with their roles.The film is well-crafted, beautifully shot, with interesting stories and characters, a solid narrative structure and features an unforgettable ending. It's not perfect, no. It's overly melodramatic, overly ambitious and slightly overlong. Even with these flaws, though, Magnolia is a dazzling display of filmmaking, and for those who appreciate ambitious cinema, it's (mostly) a joy to watch. If you have a high tolerance for excess, then check it out.",N/A
688619,"I don't know, from their audio commentary, whether these guys recognize how obvious their primary influences are.  One is Monty Python's Flying Circus, a show that aimed for non-linear sketch comedy, continuous flow at the expense of traditional structure (sometimes even dispensing with punchlines), brilliance, relevance, surrealism, and which didn't &quot;play down&quot; to the audience but instead aimed for a high degree of intellectualism.  Kids in the Hall, who were influenced by Python, retained most of those characteristics but updated the genre, moving towards small dramatic scenes while dealing with issues like the modern family unit, big business, working for a big business, and teenage angst.Mr. Show plays exactly like those two shows did.  It is occasionally bizarre and effete in a way that will turn viewers off.  But it is frequently brilliant, so brilliant, incisive, and funny that it can make you cry.  Among the topics explored and satirized well are political correctness, homophobia, global capitalism, and vapidity on television.David Cross, especially, is a great performer, and Bob Odenkirk certainly has his moments.

I especially enjoyed the relationships that develop between the young boy and his first music teacher and between his father and the young neighbor.The mandarin dialogue is excellently translated into idiom-rich English. I also liked the openness of the movies portrayal of the &quot;guanxi&quot; (favoritism) in Chinese society.American watchers may find one or two conversations a bit slow and circular - but remember you are catching a glimpse into another society - one that is not so fast paced and not always as direct in speech as our own. All in all, this movie has a fast pace a plot that keeps you guessing what will happen next. The teenage star throws in a twist of his own (as teenagers often do).Unless the sound of beautiful, emotional orchestral music with powerful ever intensifying violin solos makes you want to put cotton in your ears and leave the building, I can't think of anyone who would not like this movie.",N/A
438897,"This one is a simple story that can get confusing, but has just the right stuff to keep the audience on track.  Instead of a revenge theme like we so commonly see in the kung-fu flicks.  Not that revenge themes are bad but it gives us a new taste to a different type of film.Basically, a master has taught his pupils 5 deadly arts of Kung-fu all of which fit the the title 5 deadly venoms because the styles mimic animals that are poisonous.  The centipede, snake, toad, lizard, scorpion.  Hence the name ""poison clan"".  The master teaches all of these to pupils at different times and is only explained by the master as a sort of flashback but more of a background builder.  Each pupil mastered a specific style within the clan but do not know anything besides that style.  However, they know their own style very well.  Each style has it's own weaknesses but if one can know how to do them all they essetially complement each other and then one can have no weaknesses.  The master is telling this story to his pupil Yan Tieh who actually has a small role in the film even though his role is rather important because it actually sets things in motion.  The reason is the master has taught all of the tecniques to Yan but he doesnt know anyone technique very well and therefore he can be easily beaten by anyone of the 5 previous pupils.  His mission is to check up on the 5 pupils to see if they are doing good deeds with their skills.  As the story unfolds there are 2 who are obviously bad and are after a treasure and killing people left and right.  Only they screw up and use their skills and leave death marks of special kung-fu on the people they killed.  PLus to add to all the fun some innocent bystander witness thee murders.  2 others are less noticeable but are good and one later reveals himself who is actually an officer of the law (but you kind of figure this out because he get the lead role in the film).  The officer hides himself by using the Toad who is his friend to help caputure the bad guys which are centipede style and later the snake who actually has a feels sorry for his murders and centipde who could careless and wants to keep using his skills to kill people for money and status.  They succeed and a chain of events leads to an ultimate battle at the end because the scorpion actually finds the map to the treasure and later reveals himself as the wild card of the stack and plots to kill all of the clan members so he can be the most powerful and have all the gold.  Yan teams up with the officer who has the lizard skills and teaches Yan his style.  The toad is tortured to death because Snake and Centipede styles are behind the whole thing and have semi-control over the governing body.Toad: strengths are iron skin style (it does exist in real life but well over dramatic in the movie of course).  The iron skin does not allow weapons and hand to hand combat strikes to cause damage to the person who trained toad style.  His weakness is his temples.Lizard: Strengths are able to do wall kung-fu.  Able to strike like a lizard while standing on the wall.Centipede:  Speed of attack is best of all the techniques and rest of the styles.Snake: It's awkward floor (fighting while on the ground) and hand speed and cunning is its strengths.Scorpion: Able to smash objects with great efficiency.  The powerhouse of the techniques.You can tell putting all these together makes you basically invincible.The wall-to-wall action makes the pace of the film fast and furious.  The unique kung-fu is fun to watch and the coreography is brilliant.  The best thing is the actors are very talented and very fast with their fighting.

536208,"Other reviewers have already covered all the bases, but I feel I have to say something about this cinematic prostate exam. Avoid. This film massacres the book. It leaves out important characters and events, and completely changes the story(the ending). Even if you've never read the book and don't know what you're missing, avoid anyway! Hannibal Lecter is NOT scary outside his cell. It's a huge mistake to show the things he does. By not showing you and simply telling you-like they did in Silence Of The Lambs-your mind can fill in the gaps with the most horrible and terrifying things imaginable. That worked! Showing him does not! And what's with Julianne Moore? Why does Hollywood think that using a different actor for a role played by a previous actor/actress isn't going to affect anything? Jodie Foster was half of the friggin' movie! I'm sorry, but when they switch actors it is just not the same, especially such a memorable role in a classic film.

762374,"If there is one unfortunate drawback about ANIMATION RUNNER KUROMI, it may be that it's much too short.  Too short, clocking in at only 38 minutes.  This is a definite shame, because, at best, this lucky winner of the ""Best OVA Feature Award"" at the Tokyo International Anime Fair, is hilarious, wacky, laugh-out-loud fun.Directed by Akitaroh Daichi (NOW AND THEN, THEN AND THERE and FRUITS BASKET), this is a mockumentary about life at an animation studio in (where else?) Japan.  At the center of it all is the title character, Makiko Okuro (nicknamed Kuromi), a young, peppy college graduate whose first day of work at this animation studio, Studio Petit, turns out to be a nightmarish experience.  The current production manager falls mysteriously sick on giving her a tour of the residence, time is a-running out for the studio to produce Episode 2 of TIME JOURNEYS, and the animation staff -- all with the most eccentric of personalities and problems: there's this guy who produces a lot of key animation sheets but does them horribly out of order, a slacker who only churns out few, if any work, due to being surrounded by toys, a pessimistic woman who really needs to be complimented and look on the bright side, and a newly-wed animator who has a lot to complain about her husband andreducesherselftotalkingamileaminutewhenshementionsherdilemmas -- is falling behind schedule.  What's a new assistant manager like Kuromi to do?  Of course, everything works out, but not before we survive an onslaught of outrageously funny scenes, gags, in-joke references, and eyepoppingly colorful animation techniques similar to those of HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES (badly drawn Cartoon exaggerations from our characters one moment, and the next, super-deformed!).All of this might seem like a hodgepodge of nonsense, but it works because it's so consistent and obvious.  It's also an interesting look at how life at an animation studio can sometimes be turbulent (and introduce people to the inside stories of what REALLY goes in the production stages of putting together an animated show).  It does all of this so entertainingly that it becomes a shame when it just ends so soon.  A show like this really could have been expanded.  Not that I'm upset, though: the director and his team are reported to have begun work on the sequel.I was at the BIG APPLE ANIME FEST in New York when I purchased this title.  I had come to attend the Voice Acting Panel and have three DVDs of mine autographed by voice actress Lisa Ortiz for her wonderful performances as Deedlit the High Elf from RECORD OF LODOSS WAR, and Tsubasa Shibahime from HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES.  However, upon listening to the dub, I am pleased to announce that Ortiz once again shines in her over-the-top, enthusiastic portrayal of Kuromi, using her Shibahime voice for the most part.  (She says in an interview included on this DVD that she has been known to be crazy sometimes!)  Even better, it's got Eric Stuart and Angora Deb in two show-stealing roles (Stuart gets the guy who churns out a lot of unorganized animation sheets while Deb gets the part of the fast-talking complainer).  Central Park Media's dubs often get a bad rap from some dub fans and sub purists, but I'll admit to having enjoyed the LODOSS dubs from them, and strongly suggest that people give this dub a try.  It's hilariously entertaining, although sometimes a little TOO close to the subtitled script (a flaw in most CPM dubs).  However, there isn't much lost in the translation and the performers do a lively job with their roles.Add to this package a gorgeous transfer (which sometimes suffers from a little too much line and edge enhancement), storyboards, an interview (and commentary track!) from the director, and some other nice bonuses, and what more can you ask for?  Only the fact that it only clocks in at 40 minutes.Those who are curious about how Anime is produced, enjoy.",N/A

The director's commentary is comprehensive, entertaining and informative.For example, the fact that Judy calls Howard by the name Steve is a private joke for the benefit of director Howard Hawks, whose wife called him Steve. Or so sayeth Bogdanovich in his commentary.Also, Bogdanovich says he asked Ryan O'Neal to consult with Cary Grant on how to play Howard Bannister, seeing as how &quot;What's Up, Doc?&quot; was inspired by Grant's movie &quot;Bringing Up Baby.&quot; Grant's advice to O'Neal...

329370,"The first Tarkovsky movie I ever saw, this left an instantaneous and indelible impression on me.  Set in an apparently rather totalitarian, and Sovietly grim future, the film follows two men (a writer and a scientist) on their trek, guided by a stalker, into the Zone, at the center of which is said to be a room where one's wishes come true.  Anyone familiar with the novella by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky (they wrote the screenplay as well) will be struck by how different the two are.Tarkovsky denies that there is any symbolism in his films. If that is the case, then it is not a subtext of spirituality that I get from this film, but an open announcement of it. Because what most makes this film really not science fiction in the final analysis is its deeply felt spirituality. (Not that science and spirituality are mutually antagonistic, but that's a separate issue.)  The stalker, played by Alexander Kaidonovsky, is genuinely heart-breaking in his simplicity and openness, compared to the intellectuality and cynicism of the two men who accompany him.  And the speculations the two educated men engage in are more purely philosophical than inherently science fictional in nature. (Not that science fiction and philosophy are mutually antagonistic either.)What most makes the film, though, is its intense surreality and the cinematography that makes it possible.  If you are not already familiar with the achingly slow cinematography Tarkovsky loves to employ, then the sense of suspense that this film can drum up in you will be amazing.  Tarkovsky loves to plant the camera on a physical object, and then make you look at it until you have no choice but to decide you're missing something, that more must be there. Thus Tarkovsky inspires you to look at the world in a visionary way so that even the most banal objects start to take on an ominous significance.  Elsewhere, Tarkovsky unnerves you by having his characters keep looking over their shoulders while the camera creeps up on them with murderous intent from an off-angle.In the novella, the Zone itself is a place where the laws of physics are broken, bent or simply no longer apply.  As such, one cannot approach the Room directly (even though it is just across a field), but must approach with respect by going the long way around.  Tarkovsky encodes this ""non-Euclidean"" reality of the Zone in several ways, but one shot in particular is breathtakingly brilliant and beautiful. The Stalker lies in a stream of water, and the camera then pans in a straight line, treating us to a phenomenally gorgeous still life of submerged objects, when suddenly the stalker comes back into view.  Apparently we've somehow gone in a circle, though it seemed the line of vision was constantly straight.  The way that this is blatantly startling is matched by innumerable other details throughout the film, as Tarkovsky ruthlessly and subtly tweaks things to keep the suspense constantly high.  Tarkovsky will even change grains of film stock in order to unsettle what you are looking at.Certainly one of the most moving and gorgeous ""science fiction"" movies ever, it is also a meditation on the nature of human responsibility and remorse.  Personally, I find the Stalker to be the most affectingly drawn of all of Tarkovsky's protagonists, perhaps because he is the one who most openly gives voice to Tarkovsky's own intense spirituality.",Stalker VHS

Better than high profile movies such as Mission Impossible 2 (Although, the motorcycle stunts are quite far fetched.) This movie was interesting to watch, but just that. It was ok to watch once, but I wouldn't buy it.",N/A
387410,"This being the first tour the Rolling Stones did without the irreplaceable Bill Wyman, I, as a bass player myself, was SERIOUSLY interested (and somewhat jealous, in truth) to see how Darryl Jones would do.  Well, he did excellantly, just fine.  And as to the video itself, Whoopie Goldberg is always a treat - just dig her in the ""singalong chorus"" of ""Sweet Virginia""!  The Stones themselves don't sound at ALL bad for 50+ year old men, either.  The cameos are a hoot, too:  Bo Diddly absolutely STEALS THE SHOW when he & the Stones Jam on ""Who Do You Love.""  Robert Cray, though, proves he is a gentleman, when, just listen, HE'S the only one who prevents ""Stop Breakin' Down"" from doing exactly THAT.  The band doesn't ""get it together"" until about halfway through the first chorus.  And I have two major gripes about the show:  first, ""Miss You"" (I song I could go for the rest of eternity without having to endure) lasts about 10 minutes - 7.5 minutes TOO LONG, to be exact.  And on ""Honky Tonk Women,"" the Stones give the the late, great Ian Stewart the ultimate insult by allowing ""auxillary keyboardist"" Chuck Leavell to take a piano solo.  Keef's song is kind of....eh, but the animated introduction to ""Sympathy For The Devil"" makes up for a lot of...things.

757239,"Summary:Aaron Hallam (Benicio Del Toro) is a U.S. military trained killer.  That's all fine and dandy until the killing becomes more than second-nature to him; it becomes his first nature and he can't seem to stop doing it, even when he isn't on assignment.  His urge to kill is so powerful that he ends up butchering some deer hunters.The F.B.I. are called in and they turn to the man who happened to train Aaron, L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones), to catch him and/or stop him.  L.T. agrees and does find him but nearly dies in the process, only to be saved by the person in charge of the F.B.I. contingent on the case, Abby Durrell (Connie Nielsen (I)), who tranquilizes Aaron at the last possible moment before he kills L.T.Aaron is then taking into custody only to escape and lead Aaron on a hunt through Portland and eventually back into the forest where L.T. finally catches up to him for their final showdown with knives.My Comments:I had the conception that this movie was going to be something like a Rambo remake with a U.S. special forces operative going a little haywire and wanting to either be left alone or kill everyone.  Well, it is pretty similar except in this movie the Rambo character, Aaron, isn't really provoked and ends up dying at the hands of his trainer instead of giving up to his trainer.  So, the idea isn't really all that original.  There is, however, one element of the movie that is original which is why I gave it two stars instead of one, but I'll get to that in a minute.As for the story, it's horrible.  There is an attempt to explain why Aaron went crazy - he saw too much violence in Kosovo and snapped.  But there is no attempt to explain how he ended up in the forest in Oregon nor is there any connection drawn between him being in the forest and him killing the hunters.  There is an attempt to humanize Aaron, by having him threaten to reveal top secret information and also having him meet up with a woman and her daughter, but both of these are quickly dismissed for what seems to be the primary focus of the movie - knife fights and L.T. tracking Aaron.  Dismissing the potentially interesting subplot of Erin wanting to expose the U.S. governments top secret assassination operations was the wrong thing to do, it gave Aaron a better motivation for the killings then just being psycho.  It also isn't really explained why L.T. never replied to Aaron's letters nor why he quit training killers in the military; a lot goes unexplained in this movie and it could have been much better.As for the story we see in the movie, it just gets worse.  At least 1/2 of the movie is just L.T. tracking Aaron until they finally meet up for the 25 minute knife fight by a waterfall.  Along the way Aaron does some pretty silly things, like climbing a bridge tower instead of just diving off into the water or even getting on the subway in the first place.  Aaron also seems to lose L.T. about a million times only for L.T. to suddenly find him again without any explanation.  Then, of course, the F.B.I. has to choose not to listen to L.T. and spends most of the second half of the movie combing the river and river banks looking for Aaron only to somehow become informed of the final confrontation taking place and arrive just in time to watch it end.  How they became informed of the fight is beyond me.There are no plot twists, though I'm guessing that the truck accident was supposed to be one but anyone with half a brain could have seen that coming.  And, frankly, the movie is pretty boring.  What's more, when you watch the special features afterwards you realize that most knife fights last all of 20-30 seconds before one of the combatants is dead or dying.  For some reason the fights between  Aaron and L.T. last forever.  It was wholly implausible, but I guess a 20 second fight scene wouldn't be as fun to watch, thus the extended fight sequences.  The story, as a whole, is pretty bad.  Even the ending is kind of lame.As for the acting, it wasn't too bad.  Both Benicio del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones are good, but they are the only ones worth mentioning.  I'm thinking that in the original script Abby Durell was supposed to have a bigger part, but for some reason she is really limited to just being L.T.'s sounding board when he isn't chasing or fighting Aaron.  As for the rest of the actors, they were pretty much knife fodder for Aaron and didn't need to be good, so they weren't.The one original thing I felt the movie did was introduce the audience to a new form of knife fighting.  The fighting choreography was actually pretty interesting and fun to watch, though it did tend to get a bit carried away.  I gave the movie an extra star just for trying something new.Overall, this is really just a slightly modified remake of Rambo with a different ending, and, sadly, that's about all.  If you've seen Rambo and liked it, you probably won't really want to see this because it might corrupt your vision of a great movie.  Of course, on the other hand, if you didn't like Rambo, you probably won't like this movie because it is pretty much a copy cat.  So, if you didn't see Rambo, you may want to give this one a try.  As I said, the knife fighting is pretty interesting and some of the special features that come on the DVD are good additions.  But as a story, I think the director, William Friedkin, probably ruined this by focusing so much on specific locations instead of telling a compelling and interesting story.  I don't recommend this movie (and I like special ops/action/war movies).",N/A
741162,"It's nearly impossible to review James Mangold's latest film, IDENTITY, without revealing the plot twist that makes this very enjoyable thriller 'work'...and since the director chose not to reveal it, himself, until the film was nearly over, I'll respect his vision, and not give it away!Two story lines unfold; in one, psychiatrist Alfred Molina has a final session with convicted serial killer Pruitt Taylor Vince, before execution. Despite the defense claiming insanity, the court ruled against it, and the bitterness towards the murderer, and satisfaction the prosecution feels about justice being served are clearly evident, making Molina's task a nearly impossible one.In the other, a chain of events strands a group of motorists together at a seedy motel, run by John Hawkes (who is excellent as the sleazy manager) during a storm. Composed of a hooker (Amanda Peet), who, with a lost shoe, began the chain; a nerdish husband (John C. McGinley), his wife, seriously injured after being struck by a car, and his stepson; the chauffeur (John Cusack) who struck the woman, and his passenger, a fading movie star (Rebecca DeMornay, who is nearly unrecognizable); a bickering young couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); and a marshal, transporting a killer (Ray Liotta and Jake Busey). With the roads flooded and phone lines down, the group is isolated...then, in a fashion similar to Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, people begin to die! It becomes a race against time to discover who the murderer is...The two story lines intertwine in a very surprising manner, making IDENTITY far superior to the 'by-the-numbers' gore-fests that pass themselves off as 'suspense', with the climactic twist a stunning revelation that is VERY effective!If you like your films challenging, you're in for a treat...IDENTITY delivers!",Identity
704224,"Joint Security Area drew many comparisons with Shiri, as it dealt with the same conflict and had some of the actors in both films.  Joint Security Area (often referred as JSA by Korean audience)  is not an action film per se, as Shiri was, and the story takes place in the Demilitarized Zone, an area that serves as a buffer zone between North Korea and South Korea, and describes the relationship between a South Korean soldier who befriends North Korean soldiers.  Interestingly, JSA drew more audience than Shiri.JSA is not an action film as Shiri was, but rather focused its theme to the unreal place, which is the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ.  DMZ is a neutral piece of land between the Koreas, where tensions are high due to possible military engagment by North Korea.  If a war was to take place again, it would start from DMZ.  Yet somehow a South Korean soldier finds friendship with couple of North Korean soldiers, and despite the initial hostility, they find common culural ties within themselves and grow close to each other.I liked JSA far better than Shiri, as it dealt with characters who were more believable and apporachable as compared to Shiri.  The atmosphere of the DMZ is captured quite nicely also.  It is simply a better film.  JSA is certainly a milestone in Korean cinema, albeit in a different way Shiri was.",Joint Security Area
137253,"Child's Play is the kinda movie one would think up in a nightmare: an evil doll who runs around with a knife stabbing people.  I know this film tried to be scarey and tried to give a reasonable explanation for why a doll is going around stabbing folks, but it didn't work.OK, Chucky is a doll possessed by some evil guy's soul thanks to some voodoo dude.  Already this is laughable.  So this doll, for no real reason, goes on this rampage of stabbing anybody it wants and laughing as he does it.  I mean, nothing is scarey about this.  One minute a woman is walking around in the house, the next thing you know there's this red-headed doll, in overalls, screaming and stabbing her.  Then after it does its butchering it scurries away laughing like a A-typical villain.Please, if I took my teddy bear, installed fake dracula fangs in its mouth and gave it a cattle prod as a weapon, my form of ""child's play"" would be much more scary.Not to mention the way this doll talks is funny.  It cusses, it makes these stupid grunts, and these ""one liners"" that does little to entertain you.  It would be far more entertaining if Chucky accidentally drowned himself in the washer or finds himself getting molested and torn to shreds by the family's super horny pet.And this is yet another monster movie where the monster won't die at the end.  That's right, you kill it, but it comes back.  You kill it again, think it's dead, but suddenly attacks you again around the corner.  Kill it again, think it's dead this time, but comes after you again.  Then when it dies, you think to yourself ""why am I watching this movie?""I'm sorry, nothing proves to be a bad movie than a monster that has to die a million different ways before the film can end.  I would rather have seen someone just flush Chucky down the toilet than have this stupid head lying on the carpet saying ""get them, get them!""

Martin Lawrence was PURPOSELY playing a character who was over the top in his suspicion of white people, especially cops.I don't understand why so many people are put off.  Lawrence was hardly subtle in playing a black Rodney-Kingesque character who then has to team up with the white cop who allegedly abused him.And Lawrence's character is put in his place later in the film when he finds that the Steve Zahn character has a black girlfriend.  I admit that this was a little heavy-handed, but that's how this movie goes.That said..it was not a great movie.  it was very predictable in plot.

40374,"PENNY SERENADE is the story about a young woman who falls in love with a newspaper reporter. They get married. Move to Japan. Survive an Earthquake. Loose a child. Adopt another. Tragedy besets them, but in the end they are able to overcome it. The movie is mostly told through musical flashbacks thanks to rotating RPMs and is one of the first films to ever have used the soundtrack as an intrical part of the film. The movie is a notch above most other melodramatic tearjerkers and there's one big reason for that:  Cary Grant.Cary Grant is the man. What more does one need to say?  Sure Irene Dunn does a good job in this melodramatic tale about a husband and wife who live through an earthquake in Japan, the loss of an unborn child, and the adoption of another.  Of course, the actor who plays Applejack steals many scenes, serving as the wise fool in this Shakespearean-type romance as his character balances everything that occurs. Nevertheless, through all of Uncle Applejack's helpful advice and Irene Dunn's moving tears, it's Cary Grant who carries the picture.  Grant nailed this performance of Roger and once again illustrated how great of an actor he truly was. A lot of actors would have been tempted to delve into melodramatic play-acting, but not Grant. Even though this is a tear-jerker melodrama and he has some really cheesy lines in some scenes, Grant makes the whole thing seem plausible and feel realistic. I admit that I am a huge fan of Cary Grant, but I keep digging up these old movies he made, hoping to find a film that he totally flops in. So far, I haven't found any.  Grant was just a notch above the rest and could make any movie more enjoyable just by being in it. It's worth more than a penny to see his performance in this serenade.",N/A
253697,"Among Steven Spielberg's many great talents is that of a storyteller and so I must assume that this is among his favorite action films. So many of its elements (e.g. sarcasm in the face of death) are developed more extensively in the Indiana Jones trilogy. Three brawling sergeants are stationed together in colonial India at a time when Thuggee terrorists (""thugs"") threaten to overthrow British rule. One sergeant soon plans to retire and reluctantly agrees to accompany the other two on one last mission to locate the troublemakers. They do so, barely escaping with their lives. The Thuggees are led by an exceptionally intelligent and erudite holy man (Edwardo Ciannelli) who is determined to destroy one empire, replacing it with one of his own. Sergeants MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), Cutter (Cary Grant), and Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) are eventually captured and find themselves powerless to warn the approaching British troops of a brilliantly formulated ambush. And then....It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen Gunga Din to say more about its plot. Suffice to say that, under George Stevens' direction, this is a great action film. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur developed the story, using only the name of the subject of a poem by Rudyard Kipling. (William Faulkner was also among those who collaborated on the screenplay.) Played by Sam Jaffe, Gunga Din is introduced as a water boy (whom the sergeants befriend) but eventually displays exceptional heroism. After seeing the film again recently, I now think Grant's performance offers the best impersonation of him I have as yet observed. Also, unlike Grant who later developed his talents as an actor, McLaglen is essentially the same character as he is in subsequent films such as Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Rio Grande, and The Quiet Man. (He indicated so much promise as Gypo Nolan in The Informer four years earlier. What happened?) What we have here is a mini-spectacle in some respects, a ""buddy film"" in others, and at least an implicit affirmation of the need for colonial rule over ""savages."" But if I were to select one word to describe Gunga Din, it would be ""romp."" As such, if offers great entertainment.",N/A

405782,"I'm thinking, &quot;What if I didn't waste time watching this trash, disguised as entertainment?&quot; Would I have done something more productive? I think, yes. Even if I spent the entire time banging my head against the wall for the whole time, it would have been a far better endeavor than watching this trash.While ultimately this film tries to make you think about tolerating the opinion of the next person, it conducts its' lesson by creating conservative stereotypes as manifested by left-wingers. So if the roles had been reversed, liberals would be screaming about this film years later. But since the Hollywood community is controlled by left-wingers, you don't hear a peep out of anyone in that industry about the horrible personalities created by this film.The sad thing is that the characters created in this film are really how Hollywood sees conservatives. Left-wingers actually create these people and truly believe that this is the way conservatives think and act. Of course, conservatives don't think and act as depicted in this film but left-wingers don't understand this point. This is the main reason why liberalism is a dying idealogy in the U.S. It's an idealogy that just doesn't get it. It creates enemies that don't exist and in fighting these imaginary enemies, their real opponents walk away the victor.This might have been a good film if the &quot;conservatives&quot; in the film were real. That their opinions were those of real conservatives. But the problem would have been that the liberal characters would have been seen in a far worse light than just murderers; they would have been seen as irrational lunatics that can't see reason. And that's not what the director was trying to show. The idea was to show liberals as being well-intentioned yet mistaken in their methods.If they had done the film correctly, conservatives would be invited to supper, they would have explained real-world thinking to the liberals, and the liberals would have killed the conservatives simply because they could not grasp what mainstream America already embraces as its' philosophy. But, again, this would have taken the film in too far of a supportive perspective of conservatives and that's certainly not acceptable to the producers of this poorly conceived tripe.",Last Supper VHS

23334,"""We're your new neighbors.""""Don't be alarmed, we're negros!""I got that quote from the IMDb entry for ""Bad Boys."" I read some others, and what struck me as funny is that out of all the quotes from the movie that those perusing IMDb have submitted, none have any lines about the plot. All the quotes available are jokes and punchlines that occur in the film between shoot-outs. Nothing else.But I suppose that fits the film just right. It's not a film for those who have any interest in plot, character development, or comedy - things a film such as ""Lethal Weapon"" had. No, ""Bad Boys"" is content with being a bad movie. It's for those with low attention spans. It's for those who like non-stop violence and language. But then, anyone interested in ""Bad Boys"" by now must be warned that the action scenes provide hardly anything new - some shoot-ups, some shoot-outs, some shoot-downs, etc. I am content with recommending action movies (trust me). But sometimes I expect a bit more than just bad jokes and bad action scenes - if it's going to be an action movie, at least make the fight scenes offer something fresh.There's a buddy side to the film that never provides the type of humor that it should. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith play Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, family man and playboy respectively. They're both undercover in Narcotics division, but yet they find time to stumble upon and into things that have nothing to do with drugs whatsoever. Never mind this.The film opens with an explosive prelude that signals we are in for a Bruckheimer production. It's loud, noisy, and the best part of the film. The rest is all downhill.A stash of drugs has been stolen from a vault in some sort of super-top-secret Government facility thingy somewhere. This happens directly after the opening sequence and goes by pretty quick so that the audience can get back to the action. Marcus and Mike are called onto the scene by their Grouchy Boss (Joe Pantoliano), who likes to spew spit and bite their heads off for everything.Pantoliano's character is the exclamation mark to the rest of the recycled characters and plots. Get this: two mismatched cop/partners who like to throw insults at each other (""Lethal Weapon"") are called onto a case involving a foreign drug dealer (""Red Heat"") who has left behind uncountable traces for the good guys to follow (though it sure does take them a while). Their boss delivers long, shouting speeches at them (""Last Action Hero"" spoofed this finely), and they have to protect a sexy witness (Tea Leoni). Finally they go for a big shoot-'em-up at the end (this is in any action/cop-buddy movie available to the public).""Bad Boys"" is just one long shoot-'em-up flick, with a bunch of recycled action set pieces, recycled plot fragments, and when all that calms down, we are exposed to bad jokes and excessive, ""pervasive strong language"" as the MPAA called it. I enjoyed bits of this movie, I grinned a few times, but I laughed only once - at a joke that should have been more than a laugh. It should have had me bent over in hysterics.Here it is, listen up: Marcus has to pose as Mike every time he is around the witness, Tea Leoni (long story). He takes her to the real Mike's apartment. She wonders why he has pictures of another black man all over the place - and keep in mind she thinks that Marcus is Mike. The pictures happen to be of Mike, since it is his apartment, so Marcus, posing as Mike, tells her it's his partner, and that they're close. The way this scene is delivered is more of a sit-com-type comedy moment - not surprising, since both lead actors got their starts on television sitcoms. But it could have been truly hilarious - it just made me laugh. I also wondered what the real Mike is doing with pictures all over his apartment of himself. And I'm not the only person to wonder this - Roger Ebert asked the same question.I will not discredit Martin Lawrence and Will Smith - the two have chemistry. Unfortunately, they also need a good script that can provide their characters with good interaction and funny moments. There aren't many here. We are supposed to trust their life-long friendship yet they don't display any signs of connection like Gibson and Glover did in the ""Lethal"" movies. Their chemistry alone lifted the last two in the series from being just decent movies.""Bad Boys"" is a movie that has a few funny moments, but none of them are hysterical. We are basically treated to long action sequences that have been done for twenty years, excessive language to guarantee an R-rating and make the movie look tougher, and bad dialogue. The only thing this movie is missing is graphic sexuality - something I heard the new - and supposedly horrible - sequel sports plenty of.Even the biggest of action buffs won't find anything here. I love the cop-buddy genre, but it's getting to be a real bore. Ever since ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""48 Hrs."" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" came out it's all been retreads of the same old material. Of course, if you like cop-buddy films very much, you may like this film. Especially if you haven't seen very many.",N/A
556527,"""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead"" was one of my favorite movies as a child. I always thought it was so cool that the four kids got to spend the entire summer by themselves without anyone telling them what to do!The story revolves around a family whose mother has gone on a trip to Austrailia for the summer. Thinking they're home-free, the kids are shocked to find out that their mother has hired a babysitter to watch over them while she's gone. At first the babysitter seems like a nice old lady, but as soon as their mother is gone, she becomes worse than a drill sargeant. Unfortunately, the babysitter dies in her sleep and the family must learn how to survive the entire summer with no money. Christina Applegate's character goes and finds work at a uniform company by lying on her resume. You will be shocked at what this family accomplishes!I would recommend this film especially to kids and teenagers. Adults might find this film a little far-fetched, but kids will definitely enjoy it!!!",N/A

How sad a result: our anti-hero is so frustrated with pent-up sexual emotion that he becomes crazed with one-track attention.  Going from repression and confusion to blatant animalistic activities, he embodies the consequences of a society trying to maintain its male population in particular.  However, such repression affects females too in a direct way, as demonstrated in our anti-hero's physical abuse of women.A cautionary tale, ""O Fantasma"" graphically demonstrates the dire consequences of homosexual repression, particularly as backed up by laws.  It's a crucial message that should be heeded by everyone.  Therefore, ""O Fantasma"" becomes a highly significant and important film work.",N/A

504599,"I really enjoyed the VHS version of this film, which has become a cult classic, so as you would expect I was eagerly awaiting the DVD version of it. Well after purchasing it and receiving it the other day I have to say I was hugely disappointed! The DVD version of the film is lousy!No attempt was made at all from what I could see to restore the original version for transfer to DVD. In fact it seems from what we viewed that they must have simply copied a not to great film copy over to DVD. The images are fuzzy at times and depth and clarity, which we have come to expect from DVD versions, is simply not there at all. The full screen version even seems to have cut some stuff out of the screen view in some scenes which leaves you guessing at what the actors are looking at.If you have VHS version of this film, keep it instead and pass on this badly done DVD version! I am very unhappy with it. The only reason that I rated it a 3, instead of a 1, is that the film is not at fault, just the DVD treatment of it.It's sad that Anchor Bay Entertainment and Touchstone Films chose not to not make any real effort to give this film the DVD treatment it so richly deserves. Two thumbs down on this DVD version!",N/A
609931,"The surprising success of Final Destination, ensured that it was only a matter of time before a sequel hit the screens, and surely not to disappoint, there it is.This success was interesting, because the film mixes your average blend of gore and thrills with the universal question of mortality: Can Death be inevitable? When the time comes, does it really mean just that and you can not escape it? (assuming the grumpy grim reaper has made too long a journey to go back empty handed!)Well,I seem to be in a minorty here, but I really did not like this sequel much. Not because it is a bad movie, it surely has its moments, but because I found it very similar to the first! Final Destination 2 is a bland, bland movie. I believe the filmmakers concentrated more on how to make the next death scene more gruesome and gory than the previous one, in a style that will make Dario Argento proud, instead of working on developing and expanding the story more. Surely they might have thought if the formula of the first film brought in the dollars, why not use the same one for the sequel, but somehow I found the two films identical as a result.Final Destination 2 is heavy without being intellectually challenging, and gruesome without being scary.The acting is pretty average as well,the best performance given by Final Destination veteran Ali Larter.On the other hand the Extras on the DVD are very good, exepct for the fact that there are '?' everywhere in the menu, which was very annoying! I mean did the studio assume that the viewer need all the help he/she can get in figuring out how to select the widescreen option??So at the end..(I am afraid I can not avoid this 'end', no matter how I try to escape it)..Final Destination 2 is Final Destination with new faces and new deaths.Nothing less, nothing more..",Final Destination 2
758069,"Gaspar Noe's Irreversible is an unforgettable film and one that is guaranteed to provoke a strong reaction. The first half of the film is so bleak and unpleasant that it's almost oppressive. Though it's not exactly a horror film itself, this film is darker and scarier than most horror films. Depicting a brutal head-bashing murder in a dingy hellish nightclub, and a vicious violent rape in the first forty-five minutes, it's difficult to watch and may be too much for most audiences. These scenes will not leave your head for a long time.The film unfolds in backwards chronological order, similar to Memento. More than just a simple gimmick, this structure adds even more depth to the experience. The main theme of the film seems to be choices that we make and the irreversible consequences of them. By having the film sequenced in reverse, we actually see the consequence before we see the choice. I agree with what Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Irreversible, saying that our present happiness depends on not knowing what will happen in the future. In this film we see the horrible, horrible circumstances that the characters are going to find themselves in. In the second half of the movie, when we see them in happier times, we know what is going to happen while they do not. This just makes it seem all the more tragic the way things turn out.The style of the film can be a bit much at times. In some scenes, the camera moves all over the place almost making The Blair Witch Project look relatively still in comparison. It's quite a cinematographic achievement, but it does call attention to itself. In contrast, during the rape scene the camera is completely still and does not cut away, presumably to force us to focus on what is happening onscreen.Irreversible is a fascinating film which will have you glued to the screen and also, at times, wanting to look away. It's powerful, well-made, brilliant and unforgettable. However, the first half of the film is mercilessly grimy, unsettling and dark giving nearly the most unpleasant feelings that this reviewer has ever had in a movie. It's not all that way, however, and the second half of the film shows the couple (Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel) in happier times and significantly lightens up. Irreversible is not at all for the squeamish but for those who can stomach it, it's an exhilarating cinematic experience.",N/A
431337,"When I was a kid, John Agar's glazed over radioactive eyes and the floating transparent brain of the film's title really gave me the willies, I tell ya.  This is still a wonderful silly movie that benefits from being short, with the monster introduced early on. Agar is good, contorting himself in pain pretty convincingly as the monster enters and leaves his body, and he's got the megalomanical laugh down pat.  The special effects are primitive, especially when the alien monster is forced to assume his real shape and reveals himself to be a rubber blob bouncing around on a wire, but heck, you were expecting Industrial Light and Magic, maybe?  Everything is low budget: small cast, stock footage, a nuclear research lab with no equipment, and a set that consists of the desert and someone's suburban home.  And what other film mentions the &quot;fissure of Rolando&quot;?  The extras on the DVD are virtually non-existent, consisting only of chapter search and the theatrical trailer.  Biographical info of the performers, especially the supporting cast, would have been welcome. If you like sci fi B-movies, this certainly fits the bill perfectly.

The music is great, the stories by historians and authors, especially Shelby Foote, are wonderful, and the images are often haunting.My big problem with this, however, is the limited scope. Considering the length, I was expecting so much more. After watching this long documentary, one would believe that Americans fought each other in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvannia over whether or not to free the slaves. For shame! The civil war is so much more. Burns focuses primarily on the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia, while in reality the war was won in the west. Battles of the east were the biggest in terms of numbers but the battles in the west, discussed but practically ignored, were more important. Ft. Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, and Atlanta are in there, but not given their proper due. Not a word is said about battles west of the Mississippi, the complicated issues of European involvement are ignored, the importance of blockade-running dismmissed, technological advanced glossed over, anti-war movements in North and South forgotten, and the causes of the war are treated with all the complexity of a fourth grade book report. Any cause not not DIRECTLY related to the abolition movement is completely ignored (but what would you expect from PBS).That all being said, I really enjoy watching this dvd. I just remember that it is VERY imcomplete.I once heard it said that a person's enjoyment of this series was inversely related to how much one knows of the Civil War. I found this to be true. As I study the war in greater detail, my tolerance for this documentary has declined.",N/A
261699,"What distinguishes a true thriller from its more modest counterparts is that in the former a sense of eerie menace permeates throughout.  Director Alfred Hitchcock, in his debut as a Hollywood director, began the first in a long line of effective character-driven dramas in which the protagonist must struggle through a maze of conflicting levels of reported truths before hitting the one that rings true.  With REBECCA, Hitchcock takes the novel by Daphne Du Maurier in which a second wife must contend with the suffocating presence of the late first wife.  What stamps REBECCA as a timeless film that explores the degree to which tormented minds hold onto the past even at the cost of the loss of the present is the seamless melding of mood to plot.  The dark and brooding English landscape ought to have been listed in the actors' credits, so thoroughly does it impact on the audience.  The magnificent mansion of Manderly is situated on a moor that seems right out of WUTHERING HEIGHTS--no surprise there since Lawrence Olivier, who played Heathcliffe, now is Maxim de Winter, a soul who is as every bit as troubled and moody as the demented hero of Emily Bronte's novel.  Maxim has recently lost his wife Rebecca to drowning, a loss that occurred before the first reel.  Enter Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter, a shy and insecure woman who is overwhelmed by the constant and heavy reminder that as far as the de Winters are concerned, she may have the name of de Winter, but not the grace to carry it.  Maxim has a housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who is exactly the menace-laden harpy that was to occupy so many of Hitchcock's future films.  Mrs.Danvers is polite enough but her expressionless face and monotone voice nevertheless convey her stark disapproval of her master's new wife.  Most of the first half is a character study of these three.  It is almost as if Hitchcock is directing a cinematic race to see who will triumph first: Maxim, who will divest himself of the stultifying memories of his late first wife; the new Mrs. de Winter, who will settle comfortably into her new role as mistress of Manderly mansion; or the tightly-wound Mrs. Danvers, who seeks only to drive out her new mistress as a low creature unworthy to bear the name of De Winter.Part of the joy of immersing oneself into the lives of the de Winters is to see how the supporting cast enriches the film with surprisingly effective stints that resonate even when they are off screen.  George Sanders hits just the right caddish note as the former lover of the first Mrs. De Winter.  Sanders has made a career of playing the erudite but roguish gentlemen who is a gentleman in verbal repartee only.  Veteran character actor C. Aubrey Smith is policeman Colonel Julyan, who seeks to solve the unexplained demise of Rebecca De Winter.  His presence lends the film the unmistakable aura of the dogged British cop who will follow any lead, regardless of where it may lead.  It would be too simple to say that REBECCA belongs to the titular lead, Sir Lawrence Olivier, who truly is stunning as a wealthy but moody lord who has to overcome his own inner demons before he can relate to his new wife.  What marks REBECCA as the masterpiece that it is is the unfolding at just the right moments of plot advances that always seem to fit seamlessly into the fabric.  REBECCA was a justly honored winner for Best Picture of 1940.",N/A

I just couldn't squelch their girly-girlishness any longer.  First came the dolls, then the outfits, and now the accessories.  Great-Grandma bought them this dvd, Swan Lake, while we visited for Thanksgiving.  The whole family is pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it is!  It successfully kept the two older brothers and daddy out of the kitchen for a good part of the afternoon!If you are not freaked out by fantasy, crystals, unicorns, and magic, than I assure you, your little girl will enjoy this dvd.  I think what I really enjoyed about it is that it uses the classical Swan Lake music, rather than Disney-esque songs.  So if I have to listen to it in the background every day for the next week or two (as children are wont to do with a new dvd), it is much more pleasant than listening to inanimate objects singing mind-numbing verse.The animation is very realistic, especially the dance sequences.  The story is about good vs evil, and courage.  There is humor, beauty, some scariness, and of course, true love.The additional featurette about girls and music was very interesting.  It features five teenage girls and how music is such a strong part of their lives (two violins, one cello, one harp, and one trumpet).  My girls have now taken to ""performing"" music for us, using a little electronic keyboard and a guitar, which they prop between their legs like a cello.  They even ""rehearse"" prior to performing.  I think a love of music is vitally important in creating a well-rounded soul, and I am thrilled that this Barbie featurette gave them an impetus to actively participate in music-making, rather than just listening.Again, it was much better than we expected.  I'm beginning to think this Barbie-thing could be a lot of fun.  I'm looking forward to expanding my Barbie horizon.",Barbie of Swan Lake
749802,"...And the countdown is on!  One of the compelling themes that runs through 24 is the idea that someone, somewhere, is always running out of time.  That's a notion that we can all identify with on many levels.  Throw in a nuclear bomb scheduled to be detonated somewhere in Los Angeles, a group of renegade terrorists who control the bomb and a retired agent with a tragic past, and you've got a recipe for suspense, action and the unexpected.  The major strength of 24 has always been its ability to be twisted and unpredictable.  Although some of the surprises aren't as shocking as those in the first season of the show, there are more than enough to ratchet up the tension in this drama until the viewer's nerves become taught with anticipation.  Kiefer Sutherland proved himself a top-notch actor in the first season of this unique series and he returns as Federal Agent Jack Bauer.  Bauer is a man haunted by his own demons; the tragic death of his wife and the estrangement of his daughter Kim.  The last thing he wants to do is help his old friends at CTU with another mission.  But he can't bring himself to say no to President David Palmer when he is asked to help hunt down a nuclear bomb somewhere in L.A.  Jack is dragged into the middle of it all and finds himself working undercover with a McVeigh-like group of domestic terrorists, a path that will ultimately lead him to a forced alliance with his arch nemesis, Nina Myers (Sarah Clark), the traitor who killed Jack's wife in the explosive finale of season one.  The scenes between jack and Nina are probably the most electrifying and intense during the course of the day.  Once they worked as partners and lovers, and now they must track down the bomb with an ever-present sense of murderous ferocity between them.  Meanwhile, Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), must deal with a conspiracy within his own administration, lead by those who seek to remove him from power any way they can.  Things become more complicated when Palmer's duplicitous ex wife, Sherry (Penny Johnson Jerald), arrives on the scene claiming to have information that will help the President during this crisis.  Other familiar faces return from the first season, including the rye Tony Almeda (Carlos Bernard), the loyal Mike Novick (Jude Ciccolella) and the apathetic George Mason (Xander Berkeley).  Mason was a minor character during the previous season, but his role in this day's events becomes important as he is forced to face his own destiny.  We also meet a young lady who is about to marry a Middle Eastern businessman who may or not be a terrorist.  The weakest plot thread throughout Day Two involves Kim Bauer (Elisha Cuthbert).  Many fans found her exploits annoying during the first season when she was more central to the story, but during this day of building terror, she seems to serve as little more than filler as she tries to help a little girl flea Los Angeles and her abusive father.  The purpose of the writers seems to be to put Kim in every conceivable terrifying scenario, from a hostage situation in a convenience store to an unexpected encounter in the woods with a cougar.  Still, while they are irritating, the Kim story line doesn't detract from the excellent suspense of the other major plots as Jack hunts down the nuclear bomb and tries to prevent a war from being waged by the U.S. in the Middle East.  The real-time format in which each episode represents one hour in this day-long period may create implausibility at times, but its easy to forgive the writers when the tension is razor sharp.The extras in this DVD package are superb and are far superior to the meager offerings of the Season One set.  We are given 44 deleted scenes that can be branched into the shows, episode commentary from all major stars and producers and three behind-the-scenes documentaries that take up an entire bonus disk.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound is in clear Dolby 5.1 dynamics.  Many fans have compared the two seasons and there seems to be a split decision as to which one is better.  While I personally lean a bit more toward season one as the better story offering, both seasons are excellent and I encourage every viewer to check out both packages and decide for yourself.  Whether you prefer season one or two, you won't be disappointed with either.  It is well worth the money you would invest to own the box set.  Once you start watching, you won't be able to stop.  Like the previous season, 24 is one hell of a wild ride from start to finish.",24: Season 2

Of course Clint plays a rough and tumble policeman like in his Dirty Harry roles, but in this movie, he does show a more down to earth side, lighter side. There's a terrific car chase involving Clint and when it's over, it's rather comical.Nick gets a new partner David Ackerman (played by Charlie Sheen) who looks more like an insurance salesman than a policeman, mainly because he's from the side of town where you learn early in life where to put your fork and knife on the table.With this new partner, the two head out to try and find the thieves. The head goon is played by none other than Raul Julia.

611644,"Ok, so maybe it's not ""Animal House"", but in a time of silly teen comedies, ""Old School"" delivers exactly what you can imply from the title. Also, it's just another excuse to watch Will Ferrell (one of the funniest guys alive in my opinion) doing what he does best: make us laugh until we fall from our seats. Also, this Unrated version is the one you want to have, where they make sure not to hold back any punches. And did I mention that, for a change, the special features [aren't bad]?The plot is the least important thing. Actually, it's very formulaic: Luke Wilson's character buys a house on campus territory and lets his crazy friends (played by Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell) to make a giant monster of a party. It's so wild, that the next day he is kicked off the University grounds by the Dean (played by Jeremy Piven, who does the complete opposite of his character in ""PCU""). So the three friends have only one solution: start a fraternity. From then on, you know the drill. They have to overcome all obstacles and beat the system that's trying to bring them down.The movie is also a wonderful parody of ""Fight Club"", not only because of key scenes involving the recruiting of new frat members, but also because it carries the same load of self-destruction, especially regarding the character of Will Ferrell: Frank the Tank, a guy who realizes he doesn't want to live the life of a married man and returns to the life he used to have in college, mainly becoming a sloppy drunk. You can see also lots of cameo appearances, like 24's Elisha Cuthbert, Juliette Lewis, Sean William Scott and Snoop Dog. The humor in this film is very 80's, but it doesn't come close to the stupidity of teen films like ""American Pie"", ""Not Another Teen movie"" or ""Just Married"". This one is made by proffesionals, and you can see that.Now, for the edition, I think the best thing is the Inside the Actors Studio spoof. I would buy the DVD for this feature alone! You know from SNL that Will Ferrell does a great impersonation of James Lipton, and here he does a 20-minute piece in which Lipton interviews him and the rest of the cast. The fact that no one is laughing and the interview has a ""serious"" tone makes it even funnier! Just watch it and you'll pass out laughing. I know I did. The other features are ok, but this is the one to check out.So, in conclusion, ""Old School"" may not be the best comedy around, but it makes a sincere effort in avoiding the cliches of today's comedies and return to hard-core stuff with great, experienced comedians. For all fans of will Ferrell is a must see, but if you want the best college comedies, you're better off getting ""Animal House"".

781589,"""As Time Goes By"" is the gentle, funny story of Jean Pargetter and Lionel Hardcastle, two people who used to be in love in the early fifties. When Lionel went off to fight in the Korean War, the two lost touch. They meet again 38 years later, quite by accident, and what is at first an awkward friendship slowly morphs into a warm romance.In Series 6 of ""As Time Goes By"" (originally aired in 1997), we are treated to some of the best episodes yet. It is a near-perfect season. Some fans have even pontificated that this could very well have been a great way for the show to have ended. I count myself in that crowd. It is true that some of the supporting character's plot lines are still left at loose ends, but the romance of Jean & Lionel -- the true story arc of the series -- pretty much resolves itself in series 6, and in such powerful, sweet, and meaningful ways.There are 7 episodes in all on this set. Episode 1 is a cute, slightly suspenseful story about someone stalking Sandy (Jean & Lionel's lodger). We get to meet 'Nails', one of Alistair Deacon's associates. And another interesting addition to the ""As Time Goes By"" list of memorable guest characters.Episode 2 takes up one of the last real threads of the Jean & Lionel story arc: Jean's retirement. Lionel is becoming bored without her home during the day, and the issue is pressed. Jean visits a psychotherapist, because leaving work behind makes her feel somewhat purposeless.With Jean slightly depressed over becoming ""semi-retired"", and Judith & Sandy dating new, perhaps questionable men, episode 3 centers around a most unwanted visit from Jean's nosy sister-in-law Penny, and her husband Stephen. It features one of the most hilarious evening banter sessions in any sitcom -- ever.Episode 4 is a cozy little story set at Jean & Lionel's country house. Mrs. Bale, the housekeeper, is grumpy. Lionel gets sick and must be nursed in bed. A grim doctor visits. And Alistair arrives out of the blue from London. It all makes sense in the end. Sort of.Alistair announces his engagement in episode 5 -- to a woman named 'Mercury', no less! This puts Judith out of sorts, although she tries not to admit it. The scene in the restaurant makes for one of the best of entire series.Penny & Stephen pop up again in episode 6, this time because they're interested in buying the house next door to Jean & Lionel's. Needless to say, this does not go over well with our star couple, and this entire episode is priceless simply because of the looks on Jean & Lionel's faces.Episode 7 is truly a classic. Some fans affectionately call it ""The War Museum"" episode. Lionel takes a trip to the War Museum, and makes a startling, wonderful discovery which he shares with Jeans at episode's end. Their romance has truly come full circle at this point, and a more touching moment you'd be hard put to find. This episode also deals with Lionel attempting to plan a surprise get-a-way for he & Jean, with everyone's help, and their efforts are absolutely hilarious.With Series 6 of ""As Time Goes By"", the show is really running like a well-oiled machine. Chapters begin to close (in the best possible ways) for our main characters: Jean 'semi-retires', and the star couple makes a most welcome discovery. The prime story arcs of the series are completed. Jean & Lionel are married and living comfortably & lovingly with one another, ready to sail into the rest of their life together. Now all that really remains is to see if Judith & Alistair will ever decide to make a go of it, and if Sandy will ever find the right man. Perhaps a certain policeman, first seen in episode 6 of this series, can be of some assistance in that regard?Series 7, 8 and 9 await...",As Time Goes By - Complete Series 6
597471,"Latest installment of 007 manages to honor the traditional Bond elements while also keeping stride with modern times. The story centers around Bond's attempt to track down a North Korean Army officer who is illegally receiving diamonds smuggled out of South Africa and using the resulting wealth to build a satellite that will harness the power of the sun. Bond also has his sights on a mystery figure inside the British government who betrayed him, resulting in his being imprisoned and tortured in North Korea for 14 months. The film makes a few weak attempts at humour but overall has a very dark and somber tone. The opening sequence showing 007's torture at the hands of his North Korean captors is quite intense compared to the traditional Bond formula where he's rarely in true peril. The scenes set in the villian's 'house of ice' are really spectacular and to me are the film's best moments. The one truly cheesy scene in this movie is the cartoonish image of Bond riding a makeshift surfboard on the waves from a melting iceberg. The shot is phoney-looking beyond belief and downright silly. Halle Berry does an OK job as an American CIA agent who teams up with Bond. Madonna shows up for a totally lame, wooden cameo that the film would be better without. I'm also not a fan of her monotonous techno-flavored theme song for the film. Overall, not a bad movie and should certainly please Bond diehards if they're not put off by the film's gritty, somber feel. Of the four Bond films Brosnan has made so far I would have to say this is my least favorite but I would still recommend it.",Die Another Day
58609,"...Christianity.  Many Christians I know despise this film. I think it's mainly because The Apostle shows the bitter truth behind the men and women who serve God. This film is not apologetic or remotely reverent; it is brutally honest and actually, when considered closely, quite refreshing.Rovert Duvall, in a role that was destined for him, plays the part of a eccentric preacher who is running from his problems. His problems, and there are many, force him to leave his mega-church and flee from police. His actions - which I won't spoil - are shocking but somewhat justifiable.When out of town, the Apostle begins a multi-racial church in the deep south, cutting cross dividing lines while vigorously regaining his passion for the Lord. In it is in these moments, when he confronts his own lusts and fears, that the character of the Apostle shines through in honest, heart-bursting segments. He is a broken man, but still a man of God, just as many of the men and women of the Bible are. Bruised, battered, yet still willing. That's what I loved about this film. It is a true depiction of people who follow Jesus. We have misgivings, tempers, pride and lusts, yet, when it's all said and done, we can still move on.There is one segment, when a racist bigot - played handsomely by Billy Bob Thorton -threatens to tear down the mult-racial church. The scene ends with Thorton's exclusionary character on his knees in deep remorse and weeping for forgiveness. It's a beautiful thing to behold.This film is ruggedly honest and will make the pious and self-righteous crowd cringe with prudent dissaproval. But hey, those of you who are in touch with reality will probably love this film.  I'm a preacher's kid and I know an honest attempt when I see one. This is it. Enjoy!",N/A

I watched this withthe lights out and the sound loud and ejoyed the B movie style(which means don't take it so seriously, expect some stupid, dumb things to happen and things that don't make sense always but you can laugh with and the same time get good and spooked) It really doesn't take it self soseriously but at the same time they made this strange and draws you in just by the unusal demon like character and his needs!

504948,"Summary:Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) is something of a 'do everything man' in a small town in New Hampshire (crossing guard, policeman, snow plower, etc.).  The problem is that he has never been able to get out of the town.  He has a daughter with a woman that lives elsewhere and is currently seeing Margie Fogg (Sissy Spacek).  His brother, Rolfe Whitehouse (Willem Dafoe) is a history professor at Boston University and his father, Glen Whitehouse (James Coburn), is abusive.  The movie focuses on a very short period in Wade's life when everything just kind of falls apart.  He is trying to get his teenage daughter to spend time with him, but she doesn't want to and he can't really get visitation rights because he gave those away in the divorce hearing.  His best friend, Jack Hewitt (Jim True), takes a man out hunting and the man accidentally shoots himself.  Wade thinks that Jack did it.  Wade also finds out that his boss, Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes Osborne) is in cahoots with another man and together they are buying up all of the town property to develop it.  Then when his mother dies, perhaps due to neglect on the part of his father, and Wade moves in with his father, everything begins to collapse.  He loses his job, loses Margie, then loses his daughter and his sanity.  This is when Glen pushes him over the edge by hitting him over the head with a bottle of whiskey.  Wade finally retaliates and, in doing so, kills his father.  He then sets his father on fire and burns down the barn his dad in it.  We find out later that Wade, still convinced that his best friend Jack killed the wealthy hunter, kills Jack and skips town.My Comments:The story is definitely very complicated, but not necessarily hard to follow.  A lot of time is spent in vehicles, driving here and there as Wade tries to work out his life.  In watching some of the special features on the DVD, it becomes apparent that this movie is all about what abusive parenting does to children (perhaps saying something about me that I needed the special features to really bring that out for me).  I can't even imagine what it is like, though I'm sure this movie probably hits home for some people.  I didn't grow up with an abusive father so the movie didn't resonate with me.  I just kept thinking that the movie was about a bunch of messed up people, which, as it turns out, was the whole point of the movie.Overall, the acting is convincing.  James Coburn and Nick Nolte in particular, are very good.  The story usually keeps you interested, but not always.  It almost seems like it is supposed to be a murder mystery and you would think that that plot line would drive the story, but it isn't about the murder in the end, it is about Wade dealing with the abuse, which is what is really driving the erratic story.  The movie is worth seeing, but I don't know that I would highly recommend it.  Well-done, but unless you can really relate, it is probably just a sad, hard-to-understand story.",Affliction VHS

759528,"&#65533;Lawless Heart&#65533; is a very quiet, contemplative film that deals with the emotional aftermath of losing a loved one. In this case, Nick (Tom Hollander) must sort out his feelings as well as the monetary and family things of coping with the loss of his longtime boyfriend, Stuart.The order of the day in this film is calm, deeply felt emotion that makes itself known, not through over-the-top crying jags or chest pounding melodrama, but from truthful scenes of regret and fondly recalled memories.&#65533;Lawless Heart&#65533;s&#65533; plot is revealed through the eyes of three people: the aforementioned Nick and his friends Dan and Tim. This is not a &#65533;Rashomon&#65533; style film though, as in that film the same incident is told from several perspectives while in this one, Nick, Dan and Tim recall the road that brings them to and beyond Stuart&#65533;s funeral. Each story is colored with the indelible stamp of personality and with the same humanity that infuses the entire film.Directors Tom Hunsinger, Neil Hunter, their screenwriter and actors have created a film filled with hope and respect. And in particular, Tom Hollander as Nick unforgettably manages to weather the emotional storm of the film with grace, humor and compassion despite all the negative baggage that is thrust upon him.",Lawless Heart
323033,"When Francis Ford Coppola returned to direct &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; his mission was to create a sequel as compelling, involving, interesting, and downright exhilarating as the original. Everyone told him it was impossible. He made the impossible possible.This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as &quot;sequel&quot; is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a sequel - a blockbuster blast that returns the characters from the original in a new storyline. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is something more. It is more of a chapter than a sequel. A continuation, if you will. The same characters are all here - at least those who survived the original, that is - but when I call it a &quot;sequel,&quot; it strikes the wrong cord. It is as if both films are one, divided into two separate chapters. When you read a novel, and someone asks you if you liked it, you don't say, &quot;Yeah, but I liked the first chapter better than the second and so on.&quot; You either like or dislike the novel. Think of &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; as a chapter in a novel; it is a true continuation, nothing more.This film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life.As I write this review, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; holds the no. 3 spot on the IMDb's list of the top 250 films of all time. ""The Godfather"" is currently taking the no. 1 spot. I guess people still do have good taste in film - but the fact that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; made it to the no. 1 spot for close to a month startles me just a bit. Are filmgoers so cinematically naive nowadays to vote every blockbuster they see a &quot;10&quot;?Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did. Among his other film contributions was Martin Scorsese's classic tale of loneliness, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;; Michael Simino's tale of friendship, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;; Martin Scorsese's fact-based drama &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; based on the life of boxer Jake LaMotta; Sergio Leone's true epic &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;; as Al Capone in &quot;The Untouchables&quot;; and Martin Scorsese's true story of gangsters in &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the terrific script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, with wonderful direction, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of a film at the wrong time; Coppola inserts his flashbacks here like clockwork, ticking back and forth and coming into play right when the audience either (a) wants them or (b) does not want them, which is always the best thing. Sometimes an audience wants a flashback if they're getting tired of a scene - sometimes they don't want a flashback because they are involved in a current story and are hooked on the screen. Coppola inserts his flashbacks at just the right moments. If he feels a scene is too long, he gets a flashback going. If he feels the current story could benefit from a flashback that is reminiscent of the current matters, he inserts one. And if the audience is at the height of tension, awaiting the end of a scene, he will insert a flashback and the audience will soon forget about the scene they were involved in minutes ago - until the flashback is over and the &quot;present time&quot; scene starts up again. Then they are really at attention.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. &quot;The Godfather&quot; was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. Oh boy, there I go again with that word, &quot;sequel.&quot; I really hate that word. Continuation: That's a word I really have to keep in mind next time I'm coughing up a review on a sequel. Argh, there I go again. D'oh!",N/A
452963,"""Halloween H2O"" takes place twenty years after the events in the original ""Halloween"".  Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this installment as Laurie Strode.  She has faked her own death and is now head mistress at Hillcrest, a private school in California. She also has a seventeen-year-old son named John (Josh Hartnett).  Each Halloween, Laurie is forced to remember the events of twenty years earlier, but this year proves different from previous ones; Michael has returned.  After breaking into a nurse's house in Illinois and obtaining information on Laurie, Michael has made his way to Laurie's school.  Once there Michael goes on another killing spree while trying to find Laurie.I thought this movie was good, but not nearly as good as the original.  This movie did have some good parts, and some of the scenes were good, but I was left wanting more at the end.  Also, this is a very short move (only about 80 minutes), and I think the producers could have done a better job if they would have made it a little longer.  On the plus side, it was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis back in the Halloween series, and she does give a good performance, as does Josh Hartnett.I'm sure that horror movie fans will like this movie, just don't expect anything like the original.",Halloween H20 VHS
59654,"Though this made no money when it was first released, director Steven Soderbergh's caper film ""Out of Sight"" has developed a strong cult following. This well-written, well-acted, beautifully shot ensemble comedy-drama is superior entertainment, and it ""launched"" Soderbergh's comeback to the world of serious film by proving that Hollywood films can still be smart and artistic.Taken from an Elmore Leonard novel, the script gives George Clooney his best part to date. As Jack Foley, a moderately successful thief who uses words more than guns, he's given moments where he's supposed to be tough and tender. He's smart but impulsive, and he frequently finds himself in the middle of a jam. During a prison escape, for instance, he ends up sharing a car trunk with a federal marshal named Karen Sisco, played in a sophisticated, ballsy turn by Jennifer Lopez.From that scene of flirtatious, intense dialogue because they like each other and hate each other, stuck at an impasse where neither one of them can make a move, Sisco and Foley banter and battle throughout the entire movie. When their confrontations come (in the seduction scene and, later, in the final heist), the payoffs to the audience are rewarding.The supporting cast is uniformly colorful, and all the characters are well-defined. I particularly liked Don Cheadle's work as a scary, insecure prison boxer and Steve Zahn's turn as a hapless criminal obsessed with wearing sunglasses.But the scenes between Clooney and Lopez set the screen on fire, moreso because of the way they deliver their dialogue than because of the way they look. The editing of the seduction scene, where their dinner dialogue seems to narrate what happens to them after dinner, is what makes it so sexy.Great movie. Lopez has never done anything yet that's as good.",N/A

786228,"Ok let's get one thing straight.  This is a horror movie.  Now with that being said, you have to go into this movie knowing that their WILL be a pretty bad script, cheesy lines, and of course, bad acting.  I'm a huge fan of the Freddy and Jason movies.  I have seen all 10 Friday the 13th and all 7 Nightmare movies.  So of course, when they have a Freddy vs Jason, I felt obligated to go see it.  I went into it expecting a horror movie that was going to be pretty bland, but instead it was a huge surprise.  Yes, there are still cheesy lines, but what's different is these cheesy lines are actually quite hilarious.  The movie in a way makes fun of itself, and you know what, it works.  The acting is not great, but we already deciphered that at the beginning going into it.  The plot is actually pretty interesting.  The way that Freddy needs Jason to get the kids afraid of him and then becomes jealous because Jason is having all the fun is actually more clever than it sounds.  The big fight scene at the end is no short of incredible.  The special effects are great and the movie will have you chanting for your favorite character like it was a WWE match.  I know I was.  Bottom line is, I walked out of the theater feeling that I totally got my moneys worth.  The point is you have to go into this movie not analysing it like you SHOULD do other movies, but to just sit back, enjoy the jokes, and enjoy the bloodbath.  Because, if you go into the movie expecting a great script and great acting, you will be sorely mistaken.  But, if you go into it knowing that the script isn't going to be top notch and that the acting will not be all that great, then you will find yourself surprised at how funny as well as entertaining this movie is, and I'm sure you will have no regrets walking out of the theater.",N/A

Get it in DTS and rent the Dolby version for the one extra supplement material that is missing on the DTS version.The movie itself isn't bad, it was the frontrunner in the Oscars until ""Shakespeare in Love"" came late riding on a wave of favorable reviews.  Strangely, ""Ryan"" still won every other Best Picture trophy to be given that year. (Kind of reminds me how Michelle Pffeiffer won almost every Best Actress award for ""Fabulous Baker Boys"" except the Oscar.)  It is one of the most realistic depictions of combat in movie history.  Perhaps only the Band of Brothers series, which came much later (HDTV and now DVD) can rival this movie when it comes to realism.The movie, IMO is about irony.  Forget the special effects for a while and concentrate on Edward Burns' line as he ponders the math: ""What's the use of risking the lives of eight of us for just one guy?""  The mission was FUBAR to begin with, a public relations job, as Dennis Farina says.  One bad decision, but so well executed by skilled professionals, no major foul-ups, so far, so good.  Then Tom Hanks decides to commit his entire squad against a machinegun nest he could have easily bypassed, or taken out with his sniper (who was extremely talented).  He loses his medic, of all people, a non-combatant.  He frees a surrenderee (the decent thing) and pays dearly for the kind deed.  He then impossibly allows himself to be talked by mission objective himself, Private Ryan, into making a desperate, predictably disastrous defense of a bridge against German armor.  You know the rest: when a handful of men without big guns take on a few tanks plus 50 enemy infantry, the results could only be disastrous, even if the said men were elite Rangers and 101st Airborne.I was so emotionally spent after watching this movie, I was inspired (if it can be called that) to imagine, many days later, a different ending for this movie.  At the risk of being called a spoiler (IMO, a lot of people have seen this anyway), here it is:  They extract Ryan indeed, and most of them make it back to the American lines.  OK?  Then, as they arrive at dusk, a nervous sentry mistakenly shoots Ryan dead.  Mission failed.  See if that doesn't break your heart.  Don't laugh, something like this happened in Band of Brothers, which is based on true stories of 101st Airborne men.  (OK the man shot didn't die.)OK, my 15 minutes is up.

117408,"This movie is an often ignored part of Humphrey Bogart's movie career. After all, this is the guy who was in The Maltese Falcon, Key Largo, The Treasure of Sierra Madre and The Caine Mutiny just to name a few highlights. Some people might have trouble adjusting to the rather silly mood of this film. However, you will probably enjoy it more if you know what you're coming into.Bogart plays a New York gambler with mob ties who always wears gloves and has a weakness for cheesecake. When his favorite baker is murdered, he sets out to discover whodunit and in the process uncovers a Nazi plot for terrorism.But, to tell the truth, I wasn't interested in this movie for the plot. It was the cast that interested me. Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre and Judith Anderson play the Nazi villains and who can think of a better bad guy line-up? All of them are excellent although I had a bit of trouble accepting that small-framed Lorre as the strong-arm of the group.Bogart is particularly amusing when he tries to bluff his way through a Nazi meeting when he has no idea what is going on and his knowledge of German is limited to two words! In fact, the entire cast seems to be enjoying themselves and as a result, the audience enjoys the movie even more.While this is not a masterpiece, it is certainly enjoying for what it is: an action/comedy with propaganda elements that just happens to have some of the greatest actors of the time. The double talk is fast and funny, the plot doesn't make much sense but the script throws everything but the kitchen sink at you so you don't really notice.Verdict:You will like it: If you are a rabid Veidt, Lorre, Bogart or Anderson fan. If you want a fast, funny way to spend an evening.You will not like it: If you expecting another Casablanca. If you are overly choosey about ""serious"" plots.Enjoy!",All Through the Night VHS

515952,"Never has a movie made me laugh so hard, as well as providing me with feelings of nostalgia and heartwarming sentiment. COOLEY HIGH (1975) features laugh-out-loud moments by the dozen, as well as containing many moments of reflective, poignant beauty.The story here takes place in Chicago, 1964, and revolves around a poet named Preach (played by Glynn Turman), basketball player Cochise (played by Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs), their other buddies, and what goes on in the day-to-day lives of these teens in urban life. We witness the boys frequently cutting class, stealing food, hopping buses and trains, chasing after girls, shooting dice, getting into fights, and all other sorts of typical teen shenanigans. The aforementioned outline may sound a bit redundant for a film (or maybe it could be due to the poor description I've given), but the aforementioned aspects are integrated into a unified whole, and in a compelling way. So, in the end, things work very nicely. If there's one fault I can think of (though it doesn't bother me, but may bother others), is that the storyline moves a bit fast, and many may wish that some of the scenes (or certain aspects of the film) would have been fleshed out more.Amidst all of the wildness, Preach meets a lovely girl named Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis), and develops a relationship with her. This is one of the few aspects of the film to soften up what otherwise may have been just a brash comedy.While Preach, Cochise and the boys all took lighthearted pleasure in lying, cheating and stealing -- it all seemed to catch up with them in the end, as a result of one wild ride in a stolen car. And later, a simple misunderstanding leads up to the tragic finale.Before I close this review, I'm going to list a few of my favorite funny scenes:(1). Preach and gang visit the zoo after cutting class. One of the guys decides to defend - and get friendly with - a Gorilla, after the rest of the gang were teasing it. What happens next is pretty foul, so I won't mention it here, but let's just say it had me laughing like a maniac.(2). Broke and unable to afford money for the boys to see a movie, Preach and Cochise decide to pretend to be  undercover policemen, and hassle two female prostitutes - making them believe they're going to be arrested. The ladies beg to be let off the hook, but Cochise decides to take a bribe - for money, of course.COOLEY HIGH is a fantastic film. It could provide many with dozens of belly-laughs, as well as a tear or two. It's a beautiful portrait of life (the ups and downs of it), love and friendship. Viewers in their middle ages will find this film to bring back fond memories of their youth. It can also make some viewers come to the realization that certain qualities in this film are sorely lacking in the vast majority of today's cinema.

130053,"By now there's no point in reitterating the saga of Indiana Jones.  In a nutshell he's an archeaologist with a penchant for stirring the pot and ticking off villians and the women he courts with equal portions of charm and insolence. &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; follows Dr. Jones on his quest for the ark of the covenant that is supposed to contain the original Ten Commandments. This is the film that makes everyone feel like their going to the movies for the very first time. A marvelous piece of fiction that is as close to perfect as movie-making gets.  Part two - The Temple of Doom - is a much darker excursion into cult worship.  The film is brilliantly staged - full of memorable moments, but somehow doesn't seem to get the recognition it so rightly deserves. (It doesn't help that Spielberg himself says that 'Temple' is his least favorite.  What does he know? Here's a man who re-did E.T. on DVD!!!)  Part III - The Last Crusade - is shameless in its rehash of plot devices and cliches,with a hoaky parade of uncompelling characters - topped off by Sean Connery's ineffective bit as Indy's dad. &quot;Junior?!?&quot;TRANSFERS: WOW! The trilogy has been remastered frame by frame and the results are astounding.  Colors throughout are rich and nicely balanced.  Blacks are deep.  Shadow and contrast levels are superb.  There is a slight amount of edge enhancement but it is barely noticeable.  The audio is 5.1 and, while many may boo-hoo the fact that DTS wasn't employed, this soundtrack will definitely give your speakers a work out.Extras: A host of documentary footage that does a rather indepth job of covering the production of each of the three films.

595505,"Often described as one part buddy-film, one part road-film, and one part coming-of-age film, Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN offers the story of two teenage wannabe studs who coax a slightly older and somewhat more sophistocated woman into a road trip to the beach--never dreaming that the woman might have a personal agenda of her own.  The premise is hardly an original one, but in the hands of director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and a truly remarkable cast the result is absolutely astonishing.As a number of people have pointed out, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) are not entirely likeable characters: they are thoughtless, self-indulgent, crass, and rarely think above their belts or beyond the next joint.  But their encounter with Ana (Ana L&oacute;pez Mercado) will shake them out of their adolescent-inspired sense of superiority in more ways than one: as their friendly rivalry for Ana's favors escalates into open jealousy, their revelations demonstrate that they are no less hypocritical than the pompous and corrupt adult society against which they so pointedly rebel.The film is unexpectedly satirical, neatly adopting a ""boys will be boys"" smile and then quietly but sharply undercutting it by transient images of poverty, decay, and death that the trio encounter as they move out of their rather sheltered existences in Mexico City and travel the backroads to the sea--images that the boys ignore with a youthful zeal but which foreshadow and then underscore the series of punches the film delivers at its conclusion.  The cast is impressive, with Luna and Bernal the very image of thoughtless, vulgar youth, while Mercado is remarkable as Ana, a woman in her late twenties who seems to be fleeing from a faithless husband and seeking revenge in casual sex but who secretly has a still more weighty motive behind her actions.The film has a great deal of nudity and sexual activity; there is also considerable drug use and profanity.  A great deal has been made of that, and particularly of the intense kiss between Luna and Bernal--but ulitmately Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN is less about sex, drugs, and youthful excess than it is about responsibility in relationships and how failure to keep trust can have devastating consequences in platonic, romantic, and sexual relationships.  The DVD package is quite nice, with several interesting bonuses, and although the subtitles are in white they are easy to read.  Overall, an impressive film--but one perhaps best viewed by middle-agers with some perspective than by the youth it satirizes.  Recommended.",Y Tu Mama Tambien

698873,"The premise: Spencer Olham, a respected scientist involved in Earth's war effort against the evil aliens, the Centauri, goes on a camping trip with his wife for a weekend.  When he returns to work on Monday morning, he is arrested and accused of being a synthetic replicant, a Centauri cyborg replacement for the real Spencer Olham, allegedly murdered (without his wife's knowledge) during the camping trip though nobody has a dead body to prove it.  While being held he is shown a &quot;Centauri Hit List&quot; that has been partially decrypted... his surname is among the names on the list.  He maintains his innocence to no avail, and must ultimately escape so that he can prove his own innocence.It takes over 90 minutes to resolve this &quot;is-he-or-isn't-he&quot; question, while Spencer continually runs away or fights when cornered, and is thwarted every time he attempts to find evidence to prove his innocence.The problem with this film is that, given what Hollywood is today, there are only three or four possible endings.  These endings are immediately imaginable and given Hollywood's love of a twist ending, the choices are reduced further.Most intelligent people I've discussed this film with guessed the ending before I even finished describing the premise.So since you basically know how the film is going to end, there is absolutely ZERO suspense.  Instead you are just waiting around for the &quot;shocking revelation&quot; that you guessed an hour ago.*yawn* What a lead balloon.Gary Sinise as Spencer Olham, Vincent D'Onofrio as the vicious anti-infiltration agent pursuing Olham, and Madeline Stowe as Olham's wife Mia are all great actors, and the lovely Ms. Stowe offers the added bonus of being fun to look at.  But good acting and good looks cannot save this wretched movie.  &quot;Impostor&quot; was a bad idea that should never have been made.If you want to watch a film where the nature of the protagonist takes turns you *don't* expect, try Kevin Costner's 1987 film &quot;No Way Out&quot;.

As I child, I watched this movie with my dad, appreciating only that little men were singing ""Me and my Shadow"" to Napoleon (played wonderfully by Ian Holm). Now, I'm a little wiser, and I see the more theological levels to this film - the temptation of evil, the realization of good, etc.  I will say this: don't look too hard for these morals, or you'll miss out on a really funny movie. It's a bit of history, mixed with theology, sprinkled with fantasy and set in at least six different time periods. Plus, Evil's fascination with machinery is hilarious, and quite telling to any of us who have had issues with people and cell phones, computers, etc.!As a DVD however, ""Time Bandits"" is not the best. Though I usually enjoy just watching the film, I found the extras to be basically non-existent (the trailer is funny as a time piece).

360277,"So says Lord Summerisle in &#65533;The Wicker Man,&#65533; a true cinematic rarity, an original, and &#65533;intelligent,&#65533; horror film, just as Kubrick&#65533;s &#65533;2001&#65533; is the quintessential &#65533;intelligent&#65533; Sci Fi film. Boasting a superbly constructed story, an exemplary caste tailor made for their roles, and a truly shocking and disturbing ending, &#65533;The Wicker Man&#65533; is a masterful exercise in escalating dread, with a harrowing climax that will leave you drained.I once heard this film referred to as the &#65533;Citizen Kane&#65533; of horror films, but if I were to compare it to one of Orson&#65533;s greats, I would say it bares a closer resemblance to the &#65533;Magnificent Ambersons.&#65533; The reason for this is plain when you&#65533;ve searched for the film in the  database; you find two listings, &#65533;The Wicker Man,&#65533; and &#65533;The Wicker Man (Limited Edition).&#65533; The former is the original cinematic release of the film, butchered and incomplete, the latter is a restored version that gives us 11 minutes of unseen footage, most of it important back story fleshing out the central character of Sergeant Neil Howie, wonderfully played by Edward Woodward. I said &#65533;a&#65533; restored version, because what&#65533;s presented to us is still not the complete film, but for more on that you have to watch the excellent documentary included in the &#65533;extras.&#65533;Without giving too much away for those who haven&#65533;t seen it, the basic story is as follows. Sergeant Howie - monstrously uptight and VERY Christian - a policeman on the Scottish mainland, receives an anonymous letter from Summerisle, off the Western Coast, telling him about the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison, and hinting at dire events to come. Howie flies off to the isle alone to investigate, and collides headfirst with the pre-Christian, or Pagan, belief system practiced there.Everywhere is godless symbolism; pagan fetishes, rampant lasciviousness, a mother putting a frog into a child&#65533;s mouth to cure a sore throat, the villagers, and even the Rowan&#65533;s own family, denying all knowledge of the girl. As if that wasn&#65533;t enough, the good Sergeant Howie discovers something that for him, is absolutely the final straw&#65533; a ruined and desecrated church.With his search for the girl being stonewalled at every turn, and the realization that, from his point of view, the islanders are an utterly godless bunch, our hero turns, in high dudgeon, and extreme exasperation at the islanders beliefs and practices, to the head of the community, Lord Summerisle, played with relish and splendid urbanity by non other than Christopher Lee!His assumption that a &#65533;Lord of the Land&#65533; will behave in a civilized and Christian manner is rudely dashed when he sees young girls dancing naked &#65533;round a fire in the Manor grounds. Incredulous at this wanton display, he takes his Lordship to task, to which his Lordship calmly replies, &#65533;Well naturally! It's much too dangerous to jump through fire with their clothes on!&#65533; Poor Sergeant Howie really is out of his depth, his Lordship not only condones the godless rituals of the islanders, he&#65533;s their spiritual leader, &#65533;We are a deeply religious people,&#65533; he gently admonishes the blustering police officer.With the knowledge that he is utterly alone, Sergeant Howie determines to discover the truth about Rowan Morrison. As distasteful as it is to him, he investigates the island religion in the local library, and becomes convinced that young Rowan is being held against her will, to be &#65533;used&#65533; in some dreadful pagan ritual. From here the story accelerates to its harrowing conclusion, one that made my blood run cold when I saw it first, and still has the power to unsettle, all these years later.This is an extraordinary film, literate and lyrical, part horror film, part investigative thriller; it is a film I think you could genuinely say is unique, just don&#65533;t expect any chainsaws or psychos! The performances are all 5 Star, with Christopher Lee in particular stating in the documentary something I have heard often over the years, that it is his favorite performance&#65533; an opinion I certainly would NOT disagree with! In fact I would go so far as to say that I think Lee and Woodward have never been better.As I said before, the &#65533;Limited Edition&#65533; is, without a doubt, the version to watch, but be warned, whilst the transfer of the film is excellent overall, the restored footage is of noticeably inferior quality&#65533; although it does come in a very cool wooden box! Another element of the film that deserves recognition is the soundtrack; written especially for the production, it has a wonderful late 60&#65533;s/early 70&#65533;s folk feel about it, which adds immensely to the atmosphere of the film. And the documentary I&#65533;ve mentioned? Excellent! The makers managed to sit down with all the major player in the film, including Woodward and Lee, indeed, this is one of the most extensive interviews I&#65533;ve seen with Lee, who has his own theories as to what actually happened to the original &#65533;Wicker Man&#65533; footage!

751653,"Friendships can be odd. And I have never seen a more realistic friendship depicted on film than that of Marina and Holly in the engrossing and powerful ""Me Without You."" The film brilliantly reveals a less tidy, more insidious version of 'friends forever', one in which undying loyalty coexists with cruelty and subterfuge.There's no question the friendship between affection-starved man-eater Marina (Anna Friel) and studious Holly (Michelle Williams) will spin out of control. The script by Goldbacher and Laurence Coriat paints Marina as spiteful from puberty on, her deceptions growing more vicious and unbelievable as the picture moves from the pair's 1970s girlhood into young adulthood. Goldbacher is adept at visual storytelling, capturing intimate moments with breathtaking acuity. She's also got a couple of spirited actresses in her corner.Williams drops her ""Dawson's Creek"" persona immediately, mastering a middle-class English accent and kindly, mousy demeanor. The actress' manner fits a girl whose mother has told her, by way of comfort, ""Some girls are pretty, and some are smart."" Her performance is touching, heartfelt, and certainly eye-opening. She is truly an underrated actress.Friel wonderfully conveys her sadistic character's tortured bond to her friend. She turns a scene where Marina tells Holly, ""There's no me without you,"" into something poignant instead of overwrought. Her performance is powerful, emotional, and beautiful.Kyle MacLachlan (""Sex and the City"") makes an insinuating weasel as a professor who sparks romantic hopes in both young women. As Marina's cocktail- swilling mother, Trudie Styler (Sting's wife) cuts a glamorously wasted figure, the kind of woman who's great fun as your friend's mother and a nightmare as your own.Much of ""Me Without You"" strikes a familiar chord and intelligently captures the difficulties that can disrupt even a close friendship. Goldbacher often spins her story against the backdrop of 1970s British pop records, including The Clash, Adam Ant and Depeche Mode. It's a wonderfully entertaining film that is true to life and gut-wrenchingly real. A wonderful little gem that deserves to be seen.",Me Without You

330930,"This film is a must see, not only as brilliant filmmaking with a riveting story, but also as a very clever, and obviously successful, piece of revisionist propaganda.  Current events have made its message deeply ironic.France seized Algiers from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, gradually expanding its presence in NW Africa.  By 1954 more than 1 in 10 Algerians were of European descent (pieds-noirs), with 1/3 living in Algiers.  Although France had granted full citizenship to Algerian Jews in 1870, few Moslems had it in 1954.  An Algerian nativist organization, the MTLD, formed during WWII .  An MTLD-led uprising in 1945 was brutally crushed by armed pieds-noirs, and a decade later a more violent nationalist organization, the FLN, splintered from the MTLD to pursue independance.  In 1954, internal fighting between the MTLD and FLN resulted in assassinations of MTLD members in the 'native' section of Algiers, the Casbah, by FLN activists, two of whom were arrested by French authorities.After being guillotined these men became martyrs for the FLN, which then stepped up its campaign of terrorism, both against its domestic political rivals and the French.  This culminated in the abortive Philippeville uprising in October 1955 when appalling atrocities were committed against Euro-Algerian women and children.  In August of the following year a titanic explosion occurred in a Casbah building reputed to contain an FLN bomb-making workshop.  80 Algerians living in the area were killed, and the FLN blamed the French.  In January 1957 the FLN declared a ceasefire and general strike to demonstrate its political strength.  This proved to be a disastrous tactical error when French paratroops under the command of General Jacques Massu isolated the Casbah and brutally rooted out the FLN network in Algiers.Except for Philippeville, the events of the 2nd paragraph are covered by the film, which was made under the auspices of the post-colonial (FLN) Algerian government.  Not surprisingly the movie is heavily slanted to the FLN's view of history, but the characters on both sides are interesting and sympathetically portrayed.  This includes the main character, Ali La Pointe, who in real life was a former pimp and sadistic executioner for the Algiers FLN.  The film presents an interesting consideration of counter-terror operations, including a sarcastic take on racial profiling!It must be added that with the former FLN currently prosecuting a brutal counter-insurgency against election-winning Algerian Fundamentalists, an ironic light is cast on the film's message of respect by the counter-insurgency forces for the heroic insurgents!",Battle of Algiers VHS

144054,"Less than a year before &quot;Star Wars&quot; hit the box-office, &quot;Logan's Run&quot; hit the screens as a bright and highly entertaining sci-fi yarn that starred Michael York and Jenny Agutter.  While it wasn't the hit like &quot;Star Wars&quot; came to be, &quot;Logan's Run&quot; still fared well and is now considered a cult classic.I have never read the novel, but I must say I was intrigued by the film.  A great, thought provoking story about how humans had to retreat to domes because of ecological disaster and overpopulation.  The story takes another viewing to get the jist of, but it's a great story.  Reading other reviews, people have pointed out that the first half is far better; while I agree that the film is good on the whole, the second half was what drew me to the film, especially when they discover Washington, D.C. in ruins (WOW, great production design!).Peter Ustinov has a co-starring role as the Old Man they find at the D.C. ruins and he's probably the most remarkable actor here.  His lines, primarily taken from one of T.S. Elliot's poems, often raise an eyebrow and are quite humorous.  Richard Jordan is almost menacing as Logan's pursuer and best friend, Francis 7.  Michael York (Basil!!) does a fine job as Logan 5, a sandman who decides to run because he yearns to live past 30 and make a difference.The production designs and the visual effects are nothing to scoff at either, considering the time period.  Ok, so the pastel costume colors are 70ish, but who cares.  The visual scope of the film is grand, and you can tell director Michael Anderson was perfect for the job.Finally, before I conclude this review, I must also commend Jerry Goldsmith for his electronic score.  This score often goes unregarded in this prolific composer's career, but I must say that it was a bold experiment into electronics.  He composed yet another great score in his career.Overall, if you can get past the 70s bright colors, this film is a treat.  A great sci-fi flick.  Don't miss out.",N/A

When I first watched B5 on TV I remember thinking that the CGI sequences were quite awesome - in retrospect, these haven't stood the test of time that well, and it doesn't help that these CGI sequences are blurrier than the live-action sequences. Compare the video quality to the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine DVDs, which is quite excellent.

472252,"I so expected to be disappointed by this remake of Norman Jewison's jazzy, quintessentially 60's caper film. And boy, was I ""disappointed""! The Rene Russo, er Thomas Crown Affair, is AS GOOD as the original.The original has rebellious Steve McQueen, playing a role few people would have believed he could handle -- that of cool-as-a-cucumber, Harvard-trained financier, ""Tommy Crown."" (To Pierce Brosnan: I knew Steve McQueen, he was a friend of mine, and Mr. Brosnan, you're no Steve McQueen!)The original has Faye Dunaway as ""Vicky Anderson."" (Going in, I was tempted to say to Rene Russo, I know Faye Dunaway, ... but we'll get to that.)The original has that jazzy, split-screen look (Haskell Wexler's cinematography), simultaneously showing three scenes. It has great caper scenes. It has the dune buggy scene with McQueen and Dunaway. It has ""the longest kiss"" in screen history. (In those prehistoric days, gifted performers were able to put over smoldering love scenes without taking off their clothes!) Not to mention Michel Legrand's score, and the Oscar-winning theme song, ""Windmills of Your Mind,"" that Legrand composed with his frequent collaborators, lyricists Marilyn and Alan Bergman.And it has Norman Jewison's (The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming; In The Heat of the Night; Moonstruck; The Hurricane, etc.) very able hands holding it all together. (I wonder if the reviewer who dismissed the original as ""languid,"" ever saw it.)The remake, meanwhile, is dragged down by its nominal star. Watching Brosnan and Russo work together, I feel like I'm watching a wonderful fighter (Russo) in a fixed fight, who literally has to hold up an inferior opponent (Brosnan) for 15 rounds (title bouts used to last that long), before letting him knock him out. I'm not saying Brosnan is a ""tomato can"" (boxing lingo for a human punching bag); he has a couple of moves, especially in the caper scenes, but he is nevertheless a lightweight who doesn't belong in the same ring with Russo.Well, you know what? This version, which was transplanted from Boston to New York, and changed from a bank heist to a museum job, ain't exactly chopped liver, either.Director John McTiernan is a veteran of Bruce Wilis, Arnorld Schwarzenegger, and Tom Clancy flicks. He knows how to pace a summer movie, and is as good as they come at framing an action scene. The pleasant surprise is how well he handles the little things, the scenes where ""nothing is happening."" For McTiernan's soft touch, together with Russo, make this remake a pleasure worth repeated viewings.The story: Bored billionaire Thomas Crown decides to put some spice in his life by stealing a zillion-dollar painting from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Catherine Banning is the world-class insurance investigator whose mission it is to recover the painting. Det. Michael McCann (Denis Leary) is the local boy, an outer-borough, working-class hero, whose job it is to put Crown away. I'm not giving anything away here.The trick is, that Catherine Banning starts falling for Thomas Crown, and has to decide whether he's really fallen for her, too, or if he's just using her to get away with the caper. And then there's Mike McCann's problem. He likes Crown, and eventually, he falls for Banning, too.In one respect, this movie is like Terms of Endearment. If you don't fall in love with, or strongly identify with Debra Winger's ""Emma,"" you won't love Terms. For Russo/Crown to work, you have to fall for, or identify with Russo's ""Catherine Banning."" I fell. Hard.The camera loves Rene Russo. Not that she's beautiful ... anymore, that is. Being beautiful isn't enough to fill the camera, anyway. Very few actresses today can consistently fill the movie screen, and all of them are named Meryl Streep.(TV is different. As much as I love TV, many performers who can fill the small screen are dwarfed by the big one -- think, David Caruso, the original star of NYPD Blue.)In two of Russo's best scenes, the camera tightly frames her beaten countenance, as she says little or nothing. That she wasn't nominated for best actress was an outrage. It is exceedingly rare to see one performer (think: Gene Hackman, Tom Hanks or Denzel Washington) carry a movie the way she does here. I can repeat the rationalizations for overlooking Russo in my sleep: 'It's a summer movie'; 'It' s a caper flick,"" etc.As for Russo's much-heralded nude scene, it is gratuitous, and does her no favors. She's obviously past her prime. I was embarrassed for her, and gladdened recently to hear her announce that she will no longer do any nude scenes.But I haven't exhausted the pleasures of this film. Director John McTiernan has come a long way since Die Hard, and he and his screenwriters, Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer, deliver the goods -- split-second timing, devilish cleverness, and a quirky sense of humor -- that only the best caper flicks provide. And then there's that something extra that elevates it -- the movie within the movie.Released in 1999, this film is set in present-day New York. And yet, the most successful caper of the flick may be the parallel time game it plays. It's set in 1999 AND somewhere around 1964. But don't take my word for it. Look at Denis Leary's suits. They're awfully close to what Paul Burke, then the biggest star in TV, used to wear playing a detective in the first great, New York City-based cop show, The Naked City, from 1960-63.But Leary's Det. McCann is nothing like the gruff character played by the middle-aged, suddenly paunchy Paul Burke in the original Affair. This lanky lawman is no jelly doughnut, yet once you get past the tough facade, he has an outer-borough (non-Manhattan), working-class sweetness, poignance, and yes, gallantry, to him that makes me mourn a city that is no longer. There is no room for this character in the City of 1999. I know; I live there.And if you want to see screen chemistry, watch closely whenever Russo and Leary are alone together. Now, HE's a contender!Faye Dunaway pops up in a cameo role as Crown's psychiatrist. As it is unnecessary to propel the story along, a scriptwriting seminar guru would frown on her appearance, which is but one of the luxuries in a great caper movie that refuses to slavishly follow formulas.",The Thomas Crown Affair VHS
727566,"One can look at the cover and tell right off the bat what it is, and besides being a girly chick flick romantic comedy starring Mathew PErry, Elizabth Hurley, Bruce Campbell, and Cedric the Entertainer.  However this particular title provides some decent laughs for both sexes.Serving Sara is about Mathew Perry who is process server.  Basically he delivers court orders to a prticular person, and hopes he doesn't die.  He's good at his job however until he seems to hit a two month rut, mostly caused by one of his associates Tony.  Elizabeth Hurly is plays Sara, a beutiful women who is happily married to her handsome husband (played by the always funny Bruce Campbell).  Little does she realize that he is cheating on her is about to file for divorice.  Cederic plays Mathews Boss who is giving him this one last chance, an easy job.  However when he (Perry) goes to deliver the papers she ends up giving him an offer he couldn't refuse.  At this point the comedy really begins as the movie turns into a romantic, slapstick, physical comedy.The main problem with Serving Sara is that the focus on PErry and Hurley, there funniest moments are shown in the trailers.  FOr the most part the movie when it focus on them turns into utter blaw at many moments.  In fact it is the Bruce Campbell and Cederic who really light up the screen when they are on.OVerall Serving Sara is not utter drek that many romantic comedies end up being.  However with a fairly lack of focus at times and the fact that some of the humor does backfire makes this movie a renter only.  A good date flick, but certainly something not worht owning.",N/A
333107,"There are some differences between the plots of &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Home Along 2: Lost in New York.&quot;  Instead of going to his family going to France for Christmas they are going for Florida, instead of the family leaving them behind Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets on the wrong plane, instead of an old guy next door he befriends an old lady in the park, and instead of taking place in a Chicago suburban home it takes place mainly in a swank New York hotel.  Of course, all these changes are ultimately immaterial because John Hughes is sticking close to the original formula for his smash 1990 release for this 1992 sequel, even if Chris Columbus gets the joy of directing.The same three elements that worked so successfully with the original are present again.  First, Kevin gets to enjoy the highlife without his parents, enjoying the power of his father's credit card.  Second, Kevin once again gets to take down the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), when their paths get crossed again.  Third, there are the poignant moments with the kindly older folk that Kevin runs into, and his mother (Catharine O'Hara) has a lot more to do this time around in her frantic efforts to get to New York and look for her son.  However, the fun is a little less enjoyable, the creative attacks on the goofy bandits seem less comic and more painful, and the heartstring have already been plucked and sound more hollow in this sequel.  If you are young enough to be happy that everything is just as you expect and do not mind the formula being followed right down the line, then you will find &quot;Home Alone 2&quot; more palatable.  But in the rating book of life, more of the same is less and not more.",N/A

317222,"This is truly one of the best Bond films off all time.  The only Bond film that I like better than this is the Living Daylights.  Roger Moore takes his third stab as the world's most debonair secret agent.  He is sent to investigate missing Subs by her majestys secret service and is led to the extravagant headquarters of Karl Stromberg(Curt Jurgens)who immediately gets Jaws to stalk 007.  Bond is teamed with the beautiful XXX(who could kick Vin Diesel's ass)to get the job done.  This Bond entry is better than any of Sean Connery's lame entries.  have you ever seen a man eat a shark in Sean's movies(did'nt think so).  Stromberg(Jurgens) is a little old and out of shape to be a very menacing villian but is a great actor.  I LOVE THIS FILM and is one of Roger Moore's two best films(the other is For Your Eyes Only for you clueless folks).  Moonraker cam right after THE SPY.  Moonraker is not as GREAT as this, but I still enjoy both very much because I think Roger Moore is a great actor and the only actor that is ATTRACTIVE enough to fill Bond's big shoes.",N/A
738830,"""Secretary"" is an odd little sadomasochistic fantasy in which a lawyer and his secretary establish a kind of master/slave relationship in the office.Lee Halloway is a deeply disturbed young woman who has just been released from a mental institution where she has been recuperating from a nervous breakdown.  Lee copes with her severely dysfunctional family - her father is an alcoholic who beats his wife, while her mother is a passive victim of abuse who overprotects her daughter - by cutting, gashing and burning herself regularly.  Now, back on the outside, Lee finds employment as secretary to a paralegal, E. Edward Grey, an equally neurotic man who turns out to be a full-blown ""dominator"" behind closed doors.  Together the two forge a bizarre sexual alliance so all-consuming in its nature that one wonders how this small office ever gets any work done at all.Writer Erin Cressida Wilson and director Steven Shainberg have fun with the many ironies and paradoxes inherent in the offbeat world they are exploring.  For instance, Grey, by restricting Lee's freedom of choice, is actually liberating her by getting her to channel her self-abusive tendencies and desire for pain into a ""healthier,"" more ""productive"" direction.  Lee also discovers that men with unconventional sexual tastes may be no more willing to ""settle down"" and ""commit"" with a likeminded partner than many a man with more traditional sexual proclivities.In many ways, ""Secretary"" turns out to be almost a recruiting poster for the sadomasochistic lifestyle.  The S&M; scenes are kept relatively tame in tone and the film displays a wickedly funny sense of humor for most of its duration.  Moreover, the decidedly upbeat ending of the film could easily have garnished any Doris Day-Rock Hudson romantic comedy - had standards 40 years ago allowed them to explore this type of topic, that is.As Lee and Grey, Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader turn in terrific performances.  They manage to capture the quirky nature of their respective characters without ever making them appear off-putting or grotesque.  Their performances go a long way towards purging the material of the kind of sleaziness and smarminess one might expect to find here.The early scenes in the film may be a bit disturbing for some in the audience, mainly because we feel a bit like voyeurs ourselves peering in on the couple, almost as if they were zoo animals or subjects in some sort of psycho-sexual experiment.  But then, as we get to know the characters and come to like them, we become absorbed in their story and find ourselves actually cheering them on and wanting them to find some measure of meaning and happiness in their relationship and lives.The makers of ""Secretary"" have taken a potentially ""touchy"" subject and injected it with warmth, humanity and insight.  It's hard not to feel uplifted by this film.",N/A

After doing so, I have to agree that the sound and video editing are not professional. It's almost like a group of intermediate level-instead of top level-guys got their hands on this and went crazy. Way too much attention is focused on the crowd, and there are times when they are playing and the focus is on the wrong element (i.e. paying attention to Geddy during a guitar solo).The documentary, however, is well worth watching, but the sound on that is even overmodulated at times.I haven't listened to the CD version.

The Amercian censors had some fun chopping this one apart and they did one hell of a job.  I feel like I am watching the series all over and a much improved verison at that.The animation on this show is well done, the characters are great, the story is good.  It does end strangely, but that is okay by me, hell it is practically a trademark of anime.The Box is simle but stylish, the casing is well done, the graphics for the disc are nice.  The menus are well done, sound is great, easy navigation also. You get all orgianl 26 episodes on 6 discs, even the hot springs episode that was cut out due to the nudity and swearing.Overall this is a great box set of a great show and it is cheaper than buying the individual volumes.

768146,"""Nowhere in Africa"" is a complex but satisfying drama about a Jewish German family that escaped the Nazi Holocaust by moving to Kenya. It is a true story. This beautifully told and photographed movie suffers only slightly by running a bit too long.The small family is comprised of the father, Walter Redlich [Merab Ninidze], the mother, Jettel [Juliane Kohler], and a young daughter, Regina [Lea Kurka]. They are well established, middle-class Jews who are content to call Germany home. They are not particularly orthodox in their religious belief and consider themselves `normal' German citizens. After the Nazis come to power and begin their repressive programs, Walter, a man more farsighted than most, begins to see the real dangers this regime poses. In 1938 he takes his wife and daughter to live in Kenya where he works on a vast farm that is almost literally in the middle of nowhere. Regina quickly adapts to her new home, but Jettel, unable to accept the horrible reality of what is happening back home, is miserable. Several years later, the war ends, and the Nazis are no more. Then, however, it is Jettel who has come to love Africa and Walter who yearns to return home. Essentially, this is a love story about two very different people who learn that acceptance and compromise are necessary parts of any strong relationship.There is a dynamic subtext to this movie: A family which is considered alien by most of the population in its native Germany is thrown into an environment where the population is even more alien to them. By learning to accept - and eventually to love - the Kenyans and their exotic ways, the family becomes stronger and more universal.""Nowhere is Africa"" is a mature film for a mature audience. The movie is in German with English subtitles.",N/A

Unlike most people, I'm not that familiar with MM's previous work (with the exception of the tame ""Canadian Bacon"", his attempt at a comedic satire) and I was mostly oblivious to the hype surrounding this film. No disrespect to the friends and families of those lost in Littleton but I felt that ""Columbine"" had become an overused media buzzword. I had little interest in ""Bowling for Columbine"".After watching this film, I truly regret not seeing it when it was in the theatres. This is great stuff, people. Whether you love or hate Michael Moore, ""get"" the point of this documentary (a lot of people won't), once you start watching this, you can't stop. Highlights?The interview with Marilyn Manson. He comes across as intelligent and articulate. He really should consider running for Congress once he's done making crappy music.The interview in Charlton Heston's pool room. Chuck seems amiable, courteous and a bit misinformed until Mike asks him why he hosted an NRA convention in the town where that little girl was shot.The scene at K-Mart. ""Returning the Merchandise."" Wonderful stuff. I had tears in my eyes.The security cam footage from Columbine. If you can sit through that without wincing and you're American, you've been desensitized by a media that thrives and feeds on fear.And in that regard, a primary message of ""Bowling for Columbine"" is sadly and unreputably true.Everybody should watch this movie. I cannot recommend it enough.",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Whitney Houston is not the queen of anything anymore. Who ever says she still has a voice is out of their minds. She has ZERO voice anymore due to drugs. She wouldn't even make it on American Idol. And what is Brandy doing on the cover of this DVD? LeAnn Rimes is the &quot;diva in training&quot;? Please. Brandy is such a waste of space it's not even funny. You should at least have to have a little talent before being considered a Diva. I can't tell you how rude VH1 and this Diva show treated LeAnn Rimes. First, the cut out one of her songs off this DVD. During the show she was (probably) forced to go out on stage and sing with the entire group. Everybody completely ignored her and circled around Whitney. The screaming witches drowned out anybody else and poor Faith Hill was stuck on the other side of the stage with wacky Brandy. The whole show was just a mess. VH1 should have stopped after the first Divas show because that was the only good one. I'm giving this 3 stars for LeAnn, Elton, Faith and Cher.",N/A
118500,"In the first theatrical release of the Pokemon series, we are given secondary stories to follow - stories that might lead to interesting classroom discussions.  This is not only a movie children will enjoy, but a movie that adults will find has story elements worth following up on.If you're unfamiliar with the basics, Pokemon (short for ""POcKEt MONsters"") are creatures a little like those from this world, but with strange and unusual powers and abilities that they use for their masters - masters that can be either good or evil.  Ash and his friends train their Pokemon to fight battles with their enemies.  They travel all over the planet to collect new and unusual types of Pokemon.  They trap Pokemon in ""Poke Balls"" - a small device that hangs from a belt.  When Ash's enemies release their Pokemon to do their work, Ash and his friends release their Pokemon, and they have a big battle.In the main story, Giovanni, the leader of the evil ""Team Rocket"", uses cells from a prehistoric Pokemon named Mew to create a whole new creature.  But MewTwo is not a true clone - he is manufactured to be better than his 'parent'.  Giovanni wants to control MewTwo for himself, but MewTwo revolts against this, breaks free from his creator and begins a campaign of revenge.  It's up to Ash and his friends to stop MewTwo before he kills everyone on Earth with his scientifically enhanced psychic powers.  MewTwo begins his reign of terror by cloning other Pokemon to be better than their predecessors.It is MewTwo's revolt and its results that can start interesting classroom discussions.  Questions for discussion include:  ""Is Cloning Wrong?""  ""If we do clone, do we want to try to alter the original?""  And, the most interesting dilemmas of all  - ""Is this all I am?""  ""Why am I here?""  ""Where do I go from here?""  These are dilemmas everyone must deal with.I won't spoil the ending - it has to be seen.  Even the original Mew shows up to add to the fun.  The ending caused hours of talk between my daughter and myself.  I gained a whole new respect for Pokemon thru this movie, and I'm sure you will too.  The story's twin messages - one about cloning and its effects and one about ""Is This All I Am?"" are not preachy and the art is Japanamation at close to its best.There's also a short Pikachu cartoon that younger Pokemon fans will enjoy.  Fans of the TV show will love this extra.The story makes this movie well worth adding to your home video library.",Pokémon: The First Movie VHS
773227,"Director and writer Kaige Chen  (&quot;Farewell, My Concubine&quot;, &quot;The Emperor and the Assassin&quot; among others)has again successfully created a film uniquely uniting the visual with the spoken word with music.  TOGETHER is a tender story that can be viewed from many vantages - the contemporary social climate in China, the profound impact of selfless love, the quantum difference between music that is technically perfect vs music that is from the heart and soul of the performer, the struggle for existance in the big city for the poor citizens visiting from the provinces, the awakening rattle of puberty in a guileless child.Liu Cheng (in a beautifully realize performance by Peiqi Liu ) is the 'father' of a gifted young violinist Liu Xiaochun (realistically acted by young violinist Yun Tang ) and when it becomes apparent that the child has won all the local prizes for his musicianship that his little town in Southern China affords, the father saves money and moves to Beijing for advanced studies.  One professor (Zhiwen Wang ) lives the life of the bohemian, as interested in his home for feral cats as he is in hearing his pupil learn.  The gift he provides is to emphasize that Liu Xiaochun always play from the heart. The next professor (played with great tenderness by director Kaige Chen ) guides him up to the point of winning a National Competition, a goal which obviously will satisfy everyone concerned - except Lin Xiaochun, who has gently fallen in love with the waif Lili (the gorgeous  Hong Chen, wife of the film's Director).  When it is discovered that Lin Xiaochun's father is returning to his home in the provinces - his work and dream accomplished - the son slowly discovers that his 'father' was simply a man who saved the unwanted child from a bench near a violin, and that knowledge that one man could love him that much to make a life for him changes the course of the action and...See the film.Throughout this visually stunning production (the southern province looks like an Asian Venice)the background music is all violin solos and concerti and while the actors actually play on the screen (the best I've ever seen), the score was recorded with the gifted Chinese violinist Li Chuan Yun providing exquisite technique and passion after the filming was completed.The technique of using black and white flashback sequences to tell the real relationship between father and son is subtle and in keeping with the tone of the film.  In all, a simple tale that may be unlike the epics of this Director, but with all the warmth and honesty his other major films also contained.  A very well made, fine little film.",N/A

That is not to say that 'Undiscovered Country' had any less action, but the focus of the movie was more on accepting differences, ""burying the hatchet"", so to speak. This manifests itself in several subplots, including the murder of Klingon officials.  I'm not quite sure if I prefer this mental plot to a more concrete one, such as 'Voyage Home', but I do know that Star Trek has always been on the cutting edge of creativity and special effects, and this movie is no exception.

583926,"First let me say that I adore Ioan Gruffud and Justine Waddell, and their work, in this and in other films. And therein lies my (mild) dissatisfaction with this movie: there really are not a lot of scenes with the two together, focussing on their thwarted love. In particular, there is not a lot of development of Estella, so that her actions seem a bit difficult to understand. Why is she marrying that thug of a suitor? Is it an act of will on her part, and is she really so desparate to get any from Miss. Havisham? And if so, why not marry Pip, or anyone else for that matter? Pip confronts Miss. Havisham with the stated fact that Estella is suffering badly; however, we don't SEE this. A cardinal sin in moviemaking is to TELL instead of SHOW. And there are disappointingly few scenes, as I said, developing the love story, which tends to distance the viewer from Pip's pain. In particular, there is a dearth of scenes with Justine Waddell in them, which is quite hard to take, if you are a fan of hers, like myself. I was a little appeased that Ioan Gruffud was in practically every scene, hence my decision to give it four stars. Bernard Hill also was impressively protean as the initially threatening, but ultimately paternal Maggwitch. Charlotte Rampling was her usual luminous self, creating a peculiarly attractive Miss. Havisham. One wonders how her fiance could ever have abandoned her. To conclude, I was a little disappointed, but the film was worth the time and money I spent. I would highly recommend that Waddell fans search out her other work. She has been much better used in other vehicles, such as Tess of the D'urbervilles and Wives and Daughters (both are Mobile Masterpiece Theater productions, I believe). She also starred in a movise made in the U.K., &quot;The One and Only&quot;, unfortunately not available in the U.S. yet.",N/A

673564,"An excellent DVD; I highly recommend it.  It has some footage from the early 70's and a lot of interviews interspersed with some of the music from the album.  My only criticisms would be 1.  They did not really play any song all the way through.  I would have liked that and I would have liked to see some of them played live with vintage concert footage.  And 2.  Although Davey Johnstone talked at length about his guitar work on the album (and played some, too), they barely mentioned the late Dee Murray's bass guitar work. And although there were some brief shots of Nigel Olsson playing in concert, they were not long and certainly not close-up, and they never showed him playing now.  I realize the DVD is not primarily about the band, but I feel that they were a big part of how it turned out.  Nigel's drumming on the album was wonderful and he should have had the air time that Davey was given to show his playing.  Otherwise, it really is an interesting DVD.

534520,"The Coen Brothers bring the story of Homer's The Odyssey into the twentieth century in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and the result is a mixed bag.  The film follows Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) through Mississippi during the Depression years as they come into contact with a number of colorful characters and situations.  The Coens do a wondeful job of capturing the mood of the era by populating the film with bluegrass music and images of chain gangs, cotton fields, hobos, and bogus medicines, but these assorted elements never mesh.  The film seems to be just a jumble of component parts that don't add up to anything when put together.  There's a semblance of a story at the outset when McGill recuits his two cohorts to help him find a hidden treasure but this story thread becomes lost among a Klan rally, an encounter with sirens, meetings with pompous politicans, and a picnic with a Bible salesman.  I realize the point of the film is to chronicle the adverturesome trials and travails of the journey from point A to point B, but the stops along the way just aren't interesting enough to keep you involved.  When the journey concludes, you feel unsatisfied because there wasn't a grand pay-off that justified the time you invested in the film.  The bottom line is that ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is filled with wonderful music and visuals but is frustratingly empty in the substance department.  Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson all give good acting turns but their efforts feel wasted.  When Ulysses Everett McGill yells ""Damn! We're in a tight spot!"", he might have been talking about all the problems apparent in the script.","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
170196,"Has there ever been a more charismatic actress than Audrey Hepburn?  So strong is the aura she creates that she can elevate problematic films like ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" to quasi-classic status.  If someone summed up Blake Edwards' film to you by describing its fatalistic characters and its cynical outlook on life, you would probably think this film would have no mass appeal whatsoever.  Yet, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a film that is still talked about and fondly remembered to this day - all thanks to Audrey Hepburn.The film opens with a magical sequence where Holly Golightly (Hepburn) exits a cab and stares dreamily into the display windows of Tiffany's while Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" plays in the background.  The opening sequence hints that this film might be a fairy tale with the elegant Holly in the lead.  However, it soon becomes obvious that her life is not the stuff of which dreams are made of.  Rather we soon discover Holly is a woman with troublesome self-esteem problems who enjoys ignoring the realities of her troublesome existence in favor of reveling in the possibilities that the future might hold for her.  Into the mix comes Paul Varjak (George Peppard), a writer who himself is plagued by his own set of troubles.  Paul is instantly smitten with Holly but their romance blooms slowly and painfully.To call the characters of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" flawed would be an understatement.  Holly finances her lifestyle by serving as a go-between between a mob boss and his lawyer and while Paul finances his by being a ""kept man"" to a wealthy woman (Patricia Neal).  Further tainting Holly's character is the revelation that she married the much older Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebson) at the age of 14.  Such unappealing characters along with the stereotypical Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney) should make this film tough to swallow.  Yet Mancini's rousing ""Moon River"" and the screen presence of Hepburn herself are such strong elements in the film that it tilts the scales in favor of ""Breakfast of Tiffany's.""  So memorable is Hepburn that she elevates the film several notches higher than where the film should actually rank in light of all its problems.  Such a feat is a testament to the enormous star power Hepburn wielded in her time and continues to wield in the present day.",N/A

For the early 60's our space technology was really non-existant. The puppets were actually quite sophisticated and really quite enjoyable. My only fault was the episode titles were not always in the right order,also I wished they had included interviews with Gerry and Sylvia Anderson.

729361,"8 Femmes is a movie composed of elements from comedy, film noir and musical. The setting is pretty 50s and 60s, with all those glamorous and colourful wardrobe in a finely decorated and sophisticated house. The story starts with the homecoming of an overseas student daughter for Christmas and the death of her father. The father actually didn't show his face much in the movie, but because of his death, all the women in the house become suspects of the case. At the same time, it seems that they were cut off from the outside world due to the bad snow storm outside and the careful work of the murderer in the house. All of a sudden, these women were suspecting each other, forcing each other to tell the truth and reveal their secrets, which all happened to be plots used by many typical 60s movies. As the threat comes closer and closer, everyone of them gave up their mask and show their real character to protect themselves, but would that really help, or just makes the case more complicated? In just one day, they found out all the love and hatred among them, and are psychological naked in front of each other. The interesting part was that  each woman has their own theme song that comes out just from no where from time to time, which makes the movie awkward but funny at the same time. The dancing is very 60s but the lyrics are definitely woven into the storyline. The whole film was presented in a awkward but at the same time very unique look. People who look for a serious comedy will find it strange, people who look for a serious thriller will find it too light, people who look for a musical will find its musical elements not adequate to tell the story. However, this movie is a hybrid of all the above elements and this makes it stands out from other movies. Certainly, you will need to have a very open minded heart to watch this movie and try not to categorise it into any familiar genre, otherwise it will be a difficult movie for one to appreciate. If you can stay open in your movie experience, this is surely an enjoyable movie, despite its occasional messy moments.",N/A

783303,"THE ORDER is a big sloppy mess of a movie that succeeds in part, despite being laughably ridiculous at times. Heath Ledger plays Father Alex Bernier one of the last surviving members of a sect, the Carolingians (?), that perform exorcisms, drive demons back to Hell and generally cavort with the fringe dwellers of the Catholic religion. The C's believe in the sanctity of the Old Testament and are, to put it mildly, barely tolerated by Rome. This business of the C's and their place in the priesthood and in Rome is the most interesting part of the film, though Bernier pulling out a large Crucifix and driving demons enclosed in the bodies of two innocent children playing jacks back to Hell,is pretty cool also.There is also a character named William Eden (Benno Furmann) who is a ""Sin Eater"" (this guy literally ingests, thereby expiates the sinner of his sins...very neat!) who according to Rome, has been dead for 500 years but who seems very much alive. In fact he  makes a large amount of money authenticating old works of art. How/Why? Because he was an eyewitness to Michelangelo and Caravaggio actually creating their art. Plus the man has impeccable taste as evidenced by his penchant for French White Burgundies. The man knows his Vino. Furmann plays the heck out of this role, by the way: bulging his eyes, licking his lips, managing to have the strangest look on his face at all times and generally having a gay old time with it. My main concern here is why does he sound like Jeff Spicoli part of the time and Count Dracula the other?As I was leaving the theater, a teenager says to his friend: ""I didn't know this film was about religion.""

436105,"""Are You Being Served? The Movie"" had enormous potential; sadly the film didn't manage to reach that potential. Instead of putting our favorite staff members from Grace Bros. into new situations Lloyd and Croft simply re-worked several former episodes, such as ""A Change is as Good as a Rest"" and ""Dear Sexy Knickers."" Add to this the oft-used-in-the-series plot device of the closing of the store and the staff going on holiday (in this case to Costa Plonka), paid for by the Head of the Firm Young Mr. Grace; though they used this idea of the store closing for renovations and Young Mr. Grace copping for the staff to go on holiday in the interim a couple of times in the series, they never actually did an episode where we actually saw the staff on holiday, thus it could have worked in the Movie if done differently.Nevertheless the first half of the film is fairly good in spite of the re-used gags and plot-devices; we get to see a bit more of the store, such as a view of the Ladies' and Gents' Dept. from the lift looking down the stairs (a view which if memory serves we never got to see in the series); the photo booth; and the Continental Beauty Salon-though where was the famed Madame Beryl? I'm not sure how the film, containing these re-worked plot elements, would fit into a timeline of the series. Perhaps the producers Lloyd and Croft were trying to appeal to audiences unfamiliar with the series.The abscence of a laugh track was interesting, though admittedly a laugh track might have helped the film which drags during much of the hotel scenes. Great potential, but the film just didn't deliver; Lloyd and Croft are capable of much better. Unfortunately ""Are You Being Served? the Movie"" is just dead common. Of course it was great seeing our favorite dept. store staff in a feature film, so if you're a serious fan of the show you'll want this, otherwise you should probably skip it.

761041,"The Order: From Cremaster 3 (Matthew Barney, 2002)First off, let me just say that the disc is misrepresented by most people. Yes, it's a teaser DVD released in anticipation of the full Cremaster boxed set (which was supposed to be out 16 September 2003, and is now pushed back vaguely to &quot;sometime in 2004&quot;). No, it's not a hundred twenty minutes of Cremaster 3, which ran three hours in the theaters. It's thirty minutes of Cremaster 3 that occur towards the end of the film. So at the prices you're seeing it selling for at amazon, ebay, etc., it's not worth it unless you already know you love Cremaster (for reasons specified below).As a rental, though, The Order is an absolute must. I don't know whether Matthew Barney created the subsection of Cremaster 3 called The Order with an eye towards releasing it as a teaser, but one way or the other, it works fantastically.The Cremaster Cycle is that rarest of oddities, a series of films that have managed to become wildly popular despite having content that would leave the average filmgoer walking out scratching his head and saying ""what on earth did I just sit through?"" For that matter, most film snobs will wonder the same thing. Cremaster is like the Ezra Pound's Cantos of modern film; you'll enjoy it on the surface, but there's much more to be found if you happen to be up on such topics as Biblical history, the Masonic initiation rites, the Paralympics, and other such cultural obscurities. But don't let such a thing stop you. I know there's a lot of you out there who just have a thing for men in kilts. You get that, too.Cremaster 3 is an allegorical tale detailing the construction of the Chrysler Building and linking it to the construction of the Temple of Solomon. The Order is a piece of this (filmed in the Guggenheim Museum, a gorgeous space made even more so by the film's set decoration) that deals far more with the Temple of Solomon aspect and the focus on the Masonic initiation rites. The protagonist is the Masonic Entered Apprentice (played by Barney). He starts at the bottom of a large cylindrical room with a spiral walkway that goes up five levels, with each level being a degree of Masonic initiation. Needless to say, this is not easy; he can't just walk up, but must climb, and each degree has a particular challenge he must face; an aggressive chorus line, a battle between two New York punk bands (Murphy's Law and Agnostic Front), a love interest (Paralympic gold medalist and Olympic athlete Aimee Mullins), The Five Points of Fellowship (you tell me, I have no idea) and, at the pinnacle, the Architect of the Temple of Solomon and the Chrysler Building himself (played by artist Richard Serra).Like the rest of the film, the Apprentice's assent is not a linear thing; he bounces back and forth between levels, trying to figure out what's going on as much as we are. Pieces of each puzzle are scattered throughout, giving the whole thing an odd, Myst-like feel. (In fact, the Apprentice does not end with Serra, but on a lower level; non-linearity at its finest?)Where the DVD of The Order may become purchasable for the average Joe who finds himself enamored with the Cremaster films is in the bonus material, which is what stretches the disc out to the promised 120 minutes. There are six full songs from each band to be found if you dig around enough, and a whole lot of outtake footage from each degree; various shots taken from various angles that extend each degree into a mini-film of its own (for example, the chorus line on the first level, who actually get maybe four minutes of screen time in the finished piece, do a whole fifteen-minute routine. The choreography is wonderful, and one wonders why you never see such things in actual chorus line performances).For most of us, though, The Order is bound to do exactly what it set out to do: what our appetites for the whole boxed set. If there's as much bonus material in the box as there is on this disc, it's going to be huge, and wonderful, and worth whatever Palm Pictures ends up charging for it. See this now. **** ",N/A

104845,"Bodice-ripping period flick based (very very loosely) on real-life 16th century Venetian courtesan, Veronica Franco. I have managed to catch this movie twice -- not on purpose -- and I did stick through to the end, so there is something of the ""guilty pleasure"" here of heaving bosoms, fancy costumes, jewel-encrusted goblets, etc.But this is the low-brow equivalent of a supermarket romance novel. IMDB lists no fewer than FIVE different titles for this film, 3 in the US alone and I don't recall it ever appearing at my local cineplex. It's really just soft-focus, soft-core porn for women (no horny guy could bear to sit thought this slop for the minimal nudity). That in itself wouldn't be so terrible, but I really mind historical fiction that butchers history.There are so many gaffes, it would take a ream of paper to list them all. Veronica is the kind of prostitute imagined by junior high school girls -- she's gorgeous, gets to wear incredible gowns and has loving, consensual, pleasurable sex with numerous good looking, stud-like men who respect her deeply. No old fat guys, impotent jerks, no one beats her up or refuses to pay her. Oh, and somehow someone has invented a sixteenth century ""morning after"" drug with NO side effects, so she can have all the sex she wants and never get pregnant.When in love with frog-eyed Rufus Sewell (as stiff as a Ken doll), Veronica dons men's clothing and rides horseback in pants. Other times, she wears short, revealing skirts or skirts over slacks. (Trust me, no woman in the Renaissance could have EVER dressed this way.) Catherine McCormack is beautiful, but has a very limited emotional range. She is especially unconvincing as a young teenager, since she's probably in her late twenties. (The fine Australian actress, Naomi Watts has a small part as Sewell's wife in an arranged marriage and is totally wasted in an unsympathetic part...you have to wonder what she could have done in the title role.)The whole thing culminates in an embarrassing ""trial"", where all the important men of the city stand up to the Grand Inquisition and admit they are Veronica's ""customers"" (risking punishment themselves, not to mention the wrath of their wives). This is just grating and unrealistic in the extreme. The real Veronica Franco was tried twice by the Inquisition (in private, as it was normally done) and not for witchcraft, which is absurd.Even worse is the poetry...clearly this is NOT Veronica's actual poetry, even in translation, but some kind of awful doggerel produced for the film. In all my readings about the Italian Renaissance, I never read anything about ""poetry slam"" contests, and if they had them, the quality of the poetry would have been considerably better -- remember this is roughly the period that William Shakespeare was working in.The film ends abruptly after the trail, with just a brief afterword on the screen to ensure us that Marco (Sewell) and Veronica remained in love for the rest of their lives. Uh-huh.The real lives of prostitutes, even courtesans, are totally ignored -- no unwanted pregnancies, illegitimate children (in a time when that made one a social outcast), venereal diseases, etc. Only one brief mention of the inevitable end of a prostitutes life -- a diseased outcast on the fringes of society, tossed out with no protection when she is no longer pretty or young.Although this movie is not especially ""dirty"" -- I have seen and heard much worse on ""Sex in the City"" -- I shudder to think of impressionable young girls seeing it and thinking that this is a historically accurate representation of women's lives in the past. There is NOTHING romantic about being a prostitute.In short -- bad, hammy soft-core nonsense for addle-brained romantics who have never studied history or want anything serious to think about.",N/A
730225,"This show is original and constantly surprises you. Ok, so it does get a bit predictable in the end, but what show doesn't? It's not your normal &quot;Ouh, girls fight bad guys, lots of action&quot;-show. This show actually has depth and a good plot to it.But the constant flashbacks are a bit annoying, especially if you, like me, watch at least 3 episodes at every setting. It feels like the makers were trying to make the episodes longer by inserting flashbacks that we'd already seen before because of a lack of material.Another thing  that the show has going for it was the great score and lyricized songs. However, it's still a bit odd how every single character in the show spoke Japanese although the show took place in France and that most of the songs with lyrics had lyrics in Italian.

543148,"Good romantic comedy teen flicks are often few and far between, but it's a pretty safe bet that anything involving the startlingly talented Kirsten Dunst is worth a look.  Crazy/Beautiful deals with rich city girl Nicole, who's off the rails (the 'crazy' Dunst) and her deepening relationship with the serious poor Hispanic kid, Carlos (the 'beautiful' Hernandez) who has aspirations of becoming a pilot.  As the movie progresses, happiness and smiles gives way to doubts and fears - will Nicole drag Carlos down with her?  Can Carlos resolve the tensions in his family with him dating a white girl?Filmed in a gritty, grainy style it's clear from the start that although this might be no revelation Crazy/Beautiful at least sets itself out as a little different.  Dunst gives a typically fantastic turn as the troubled Nicole, managing to emote without ever seeming whiny or tiresome, a girl who sees her faults and hates herself for them and consequently falls headlong into them.  Such a complex (at least for a teen movie) role isn't easy to pull off and it's due to Dunst that we do actually care about the possibly noxious Nicole.  Unfortunately Hernandez's role is a lot more stereotypical, and the race issue was much better evoked in Save The Last Dance, but he's still an appealing performer who creates a realistic relationship with Nicole.Although the trials and tribulations of the relationship will definitely give you a sense of deja-vu, Crazy/Beautiful is a gently moving film that not only promises great things for Dunst but also never feels compelled to fall into cheap violence to get a reaction.  The relationship is drawn out quietly and therefore emotes a great deal more than the histrionics that many directors of similar movies seem to opt for.  In addition there is a realistic portrayal of a troubled teenager in Nicole, and when we learn the root of her trauma it's a genuinely compelling moment.  With a beginning that's scattered with photographs and scrawlings this is an intimate film throughout and works all the better for it.  The ending may be cheesy but before that you'll find yourself impressed at its subtle differences in a pretty much dead genre.",Crazy/ Beautiful

719384,"Featuring some of the stars of Russia's famed Bolshoi ballet company, RETURN OF THE FIREBIRD is an artistic treat for both the ear and the eye.  Directed by and starring famed dancer Andris Leipa, this movie features 3 stories: Stravinsky's PETRUSHKA and THE FIREBIRD, along with Rimsky-Korsakov's SCHEHERAZADE.  The opening PETRUSHKA segment, with its balance of puppet-drama amidst the goings-on at a country fair, is probably the least enjoyable as the more interesting story of the romantic triangle of the clown puppet, Petrushka, his sweetheart, and a villainous Moor tends to take a back seat to the more general action.  It's a shame as Leipa is wonderful as the title character.  With arms akimbo and a hang-dog expression, he engages our sympathy.  THE FIREBIRD is more of a fantastic piece with its emphasis on flashy visuals and special light effects.  The wonderfully bright and spooky costumes compliment the solid performances of the entire cast. This section perfectly captures the spirit of the old Russian fairy tale. The final segment, SCHEHERAZADE, is more of a prologue to the classic Arabian Nights tale, as it tells the story of a powerful Sultan and the wife who cheats on him. When he finds out, he massacres the servants who abetted the affair, while his wife commits suicide.  Leipa, is not at his best in his small role as the Sultan. In fact, he seems almost stuck in a mopey mode during the brief time he's onscreen.  Fortunately, sister Iilze Leipa turns in a stunning performance as the faithless wife.  From her opening appearance lounging in her tent to her dying moments at the end, Ms. Leipa exudes a raw-edged sexuality that is mesmerizing to watch, which makes this section a wonderful final act to this solid film.  Overall, this is a top-notch film that will delight ballet fans everywhere which, despite its minor flaws, is certainly worth recommending.",Return of the Firebird: Petrushka / Firebird / Scheherazade

There are two scenes which are worth mentioning.  First, there is an excellent fight scene in which Neo fights 100 agent Smiths.  It starts out small, but it steadily builds up to a climax.  Another excellent scene is a particularly exciting highway chase.  The highway was built especially for this movie, so they are able to crash a lot of cars.  If you're a lover of destruction, you've just got to love it.",N/A
604902,"Star Trek: Nemesis is easily the darkest of all the Star Trek movies. It is also the quirkiest and the hardest-hitting of the Next Generation movies. The final ten minutes come like a machette attack and the entire movie wades in a dark, rich tone movie-goers last saw in the German Expressionist films of the 1920s. It's a very rare bird, and a delicious experience, completely unlike any other Star Trek movie and different indeed from any other science fiction movie altogether. Unjustly maligned upon its release, I hope that eventually Star Trek: Nemesis will find its audience. Unfortunately, since most Trekkies have seen the movie and disapproved of it this may never happen. Still, if you're a science fiction fan or love brilliant cinematography this film may find a very special place in your heart.",Star Trek: Nemesis

768129,"NOWHERE IN AFRICA certainly deserves the Academy Award for Foreign Film 2002 it won.  This is an epic story about the human condition that transcends even the semibiographical time it addresses.  In short, a happy and well-to-do German family (who happen to be Jewish, mostly in name only) 'escape' to Africa in 1938 just as Hitler is beginning to unfurl his blanket of the Holocaust.  The father has proceeded the mother and daughter to find a place to live and a means of support.  He is aided (importantly) by a native cook named Owuor (the symbol of universal mankind and spirit) in creating a home away from Germany.  The basic theme of the story is how the transplanted Germans adjust to their new home, how the mother (not at all happy about giving up the good life in Germany to dwell among the natives whom she considers inferior people) attempts to inculcate her young daughter on how to stay separate from these 'dirty,untrustworthy' lower caste types.  The daughter immediately relates to the gentle Owuor and falls in love with her new life.  Matters drive husband and wife apart, they eventually are 'detained' (by the British who see them as Germans not unlike what the US did to the Japanese in WW II)in a camp which for all the world looks like a luxury hotel - without a sense of home.  The husband joins the military and eventually the family moves back to their litlle home in the wilderness, survive locusts and famine, and through many trials find each other again.  The bite to this film comes mostly from the mother's attitutde towards the Africans: it mirrors the attitude of the Nazis toward the Jews in Germany. How that bite is resolved contains some of the more sensitive movie making in  a long time.The cast is uniformly excellent:  Juliane Kohler and Merab Ninidje as the parents, Sidede Onyulo as Owuor, and the two actors who share the role of Regina the daughter - Lea Kurka and Karoline Eckertz.  The film is tightly and lovingly directed by Caroline Link, making the most of the vastness and beauty of Kenya.  Truly a film to see and see again.

710473,"There is no one word to describe Bill Paxton's FRAILTY (2002), his directorial debut.  All three of the above words apply to this tantalizing, amazing film--the most amazing fact is that this IS Bill Paxton's directorial debut.  This movie is so well crafted with a master's artistic hand that you would swear that a suspense veteran such as Brian De Palma (CARRIE, OBSESSION), Ridley Scott (ALIEN), Barbet Schroeder (SINGLE WHITE FEMALE) or Taylor Hackford (THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE) had directed it.  I personally cannot wait to review Mr. Paxton's next film; I'm sure that it will be different, but great nonetheless.FRAILTY itself is different--a very different kind of movie.  It begins by being told in a conventional manner, via the flashback technique.  In fact, it sets the story up so conventionally that we fall rather easily for the direction in which Paxton takes us.  This film successfully manipulates us to believe that the story is heading in one particular way.  By the end, we've been duped, and duped so brilliantly that we had never seen it coming to us in the first place.FRAILTY is regarded as a horror/suspense thriller.  If this film has to be categorized, then this would probably be the most accurate label to put on it.  If you're reading this far, you undoubtably know that it is about religious fanaticism and the violent acts resulting from it.  You know that it concerns Bill Paxton as a Texas &quot;Dad&quot; (who is, interestingly enough, never named in the film, another tactic of artistic brilliance on the part of Brent Hanley, who wrote the film's screenplay) who awakens his two young sons in the middle of an otherwise ordinary night and breathlessly tells them of a &quot;revelation from a heavenly angel&quot; about what they &quot;now must do&quot; in the name of &quot;God's work.&quot;  What they &quot;now must do&quot; involves killing &quot;demons in human form&quot; by way of decaptitation via the axe.The family last name is &quot;Meiks&quot; (which phonetically sounds like &quot;meek&quot;--I wonder if the film's title relates to that?), and the two sons, Fenton and Adam (ages 12 and 9, respectively) are now left to take this information all in.  The younger one does, the older one doesn't--in fact, he believes that Dad has just flipped, as he had apparently never been much of a religious man and, besides, this plan to &quot;rid the world of demons&quot; sounds just plain crazy.  However, the axe-slayings do begin to occur; one son goes along willingly and the other tries to resist as best as he possibly can.You know all of the above by now.  But if you think that this is all of what FRAILTY is about, then you don't even know the half of it.  This brilliant film has more twists and turns that you could shake a Magnolia stick at; however, these twists/turns are handled with a maximum of subtlety and with a minimum of incredulity.The acting performances of all of the principals are genuine, and never step wrongly even once.  Bill Paxton walks an incredibly fine line of portraying a character who remains sympathetic even as he is systematically decapitating those he believes are not human beings, but demons.  Matthew O'Leary does an excellent job of portraying the elder Meiks child as emotionally conflicted between the love of his father and the hatred for what it is he's doing.  Jeremy Sumpter creates a perfect counter-foil as the younger, more impressionable and believing son for whom this murderous rampage either makes total sense, or he is simply following the wishes of his father.  But it us Matthew McConaughey's performance that is the most memorable; it is an absolute outrage that he did not receive a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in this role, the most enigmatic of his career.Lastly, it is the screenplay by Brent Hanley and direction by Bill Paxton that are the real stars of the film; inded, this movie should have received Oscar nominations in both categories, and for Best Picture, to boot.  It is just another example of unfair bias against the horror/suspense genre; that a film of markedly greater quality than most of the overblown and overrated dramas that are usually honored becomes lost in the Hollywood shuffle of the Holiday Season.  It's too bad, because most of the axemurders depicted in this film are offscreen; indeed, what is most palpable in each and every scene (and, ultimately, more horrifying) is the *psychological* horror involved in the telling of this story.  It is a story that is totally believable; indeed, it is amazing to my mind that it does not even claim to have been based on a true story!  It is also a story that is emotionally draining.  Finally, it is a story that is so well-told that it makes you reflect on it for a good long time afterwards.MOST RECOMMENDED",Frailty
741625,"This is an excellent video of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire with an actual performance of Schoenberg's music with Pierrot Boulez doing an excellent job. Christine Schafer does an excellent performance. The visuals are far from classical; neverthless, are completely in the spirit of Pierrot Lunaire. Computer effects and animations are heavy, as well as modern interpretations by director Oliver Hermann; but, the soundtrack itself is totally classical Schoenberg. Adult scenes make this a questionable choice for young viewers-- they truely do make intellectual statements which are disturbing and nightmarish. This DVD would appeal to both those who like modern music for the visuals, and those who like modern classical music for the actual music itself. This DVD is in region code zero, and works fine on US machines. The 37 minute performance of Pierrot is accompanied with Schumann's Dichterliebe, and a huge interview, both of which are disappointing. It would have been better to have kept up with more Schoenberg and those brilliant surreal interpretations in the 37 minute portion. Of course, subtitles are available, but only if you push the right buttons manually.",Christine Schäfer: Pierre Boulez

763354,"THE CORE is a great movie....not because it has a marvelously written script.  It's a great movie because it's what you want from a disaster movie, and has a tremendously talented cast.  Aaron Eckhart is marvelous as the heroic Joshua Keyes---not your typical matinee idol handsome, Eckhart has a masculine tenacity, a lot of sensitivity, and performs his role as if it were a Shakesperean oddyssey.  Eckhart is the heart of the film.  Stanley Tucci is appropriately snooty, self-serving and annoying, yet even he metamorphasizes into an almost hero.  It's to Tucci's credit that he pulls this one off so well.  D. J. Qualls as Rat is awesome in his nerdish role as the computer hacker supreme.  Alfre Woodard in a small role shows why she's such a good supporting actress.  Delroy Lindo is great as the shy, soft-spoken inventor who finally breaks loose in a dramatic scenario.  Hilary Swank doesn't posit the &quot;I'm an Oscar winner...let me steal this movie.&quot;  She fills her role admirably and shows no signs of prima-donna hysterics.  Richard Jenkins and Bruce Greenwood fill out this cast.I liked this movie a lot, as it reminded me of those great old disaster movies like &quot;Towering Inferno&quot; and &quot;Posiedon Adventure.&quot;  The effects, particularly of the birds going wacky in Trafalgar Square, are great.

198608,"Lon Chaney was booked to star in the title role of this film, but unfortunately died just prior to shooting. Bela Lugosi, who had starred in the stage production of Dracula was brought in right before shooting started. The movie suffers for this. Lugosi does not have time to learn how to act for the camera. I don't know what kind of plans director Todd Browning had for the Chaney version, but the final Lugosi version looks like a mere filming of the stage play. Set up the camera in front of the proscenium, and flip it on, and then leave it on autopilot. There is no innovation, and no significant script changes made to take advantage of the film medium.This film is still worth seeing, just don't go in with the high expectations this film's reputation may lead you to have.

306855,"Ray Harryhausen is *the* Special FX God, can I just get that out of the way? I am a colossal nostalgia freak and this is one of a very select few movies that live up to the years of hype generated from childhood memory. Not uncoincidently, most of those select movies are Harryhausen pictures.7th has always had a special place in my heart and I'm not sure why. It could be that Kerwin Mathews is the best actor B-level monster movies has ever had, and his Sinbad is neither riddled with massive amount of hair or saddled with a bad accent. Perhaps it's because the villain is manipulative and clever, and the creatures roaming his island are some of the best and most seamlessly edited in you'll ever see. Or it could be the jaw-dropping dragon, with his swirly antelope horns and personality enhancing eyebrow ridges. Yeah...it's probably the dragon.Neither the story nor the production values have been ravaged by time, although some of the mano-y-mano fight scenes are a bit suspect (Um, why is Sinbad stabbing people with his fist, and how come the Princess doesn't suffocate or get squashed?). But even those questions don't hamper the movie so much as give you little things to look for.The disc itself is a treasure chest of bonuses. I'd seen the 'Chronicles' when it aired on AMC but the Leonard Maltin interview (Oddly, about 'Jason and the Argonauts') was interesting and it was fun to read the talent files, which are usually a bore, and flip through the old promo pics and movie posters. The two standouts are the cornucopia of original trailers, which are of the lion's share of Harryhausen's films, and the 'Look Behind the Voyage' featurette that gave me all sorts of random trivia and even more things to look for the next time I watch the movie itself.Very rarely do I give something five stars, but this DVD is so phenomenal I'd give it six if I could.",Seventh Voyage of Sinbad VHS

The current Captian, played by Geoffrey Rush, is only intrested in removing the curse and doesn't care who or what gets in the way.  Knightly plays the girl who doesn't want to marry the stuffy commander that her father has betrothed her to, but finds something in Blooms character that drives him to her rescue after she is kidnapped by the Pirates.  The adventures take us all over the Caribbean, to seedy ports and hidden caves.

608430,"For those of you who know Ben Affleck as a lesbian-chaser/comedy-only guy, you just may be slightly shocked with his performance in ""Daredevil"".  In this comic-based film, Affleck assumes the role of Matt Murdock as well as the ""justice to be served""-minded Daredevil.  But, as in many other comics, his character of Daredevil is hidden from the real world.  And his everyday disposition is portrayed through Matt Murdock, a lawyer.  But what is interesting about Matt is the fact that when he was a kid he was blinded; yet what blinded him only made him stronger in his other four senses.  Then soon after he lost his sight, someone killed his father.  But as he searches for revenge, he becomes more and more insecure about his role.You must understand that this movie is based on a comic book.  And a comic book is meant mainly for kids to be able to understand.  So if you're thinking to yourself, partway into the movie, that the plot is kind of bogus--you're right.  It's meant to be that way.  As I don't want to spoil any of the movie for you, I won't tell you much of what happens.  But as you can imagine, Daredevil runs accross many foes and a few friends.  One of those friends is played by Alias' (on HBO) Jennifer Garner.  She (as the beautifully strong Elektra) becomes, after a impressive fight with Ben, friends with Matt.  But the life story of Elektra is not quite favorable, to say the least.What really makes this movie excellent is not the plot.  It's the direction.  Mark Steven Johnson did an awesome job with, as I said before, a guy who didn't have much of an action background to support him.  But from what I saw on a VH1 All Access show, Affleck and a few others took around two months of training for their roles.  And it shows.  You don't have to be a genius to see that.  And if you're thinking to yourself that the scenes look too fake, you just don't understand.  Another big plus for the movie was the supporting cast.  It features, aside from Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan of ""The Green Mile"", Jon Favreau (who gives us some much needed comedy--without him that would've been something the film lacked), and Joe Pantoliano (""Memento"" and ""The Matrix"").  There is also a cameo appearance by comic enthusiast and Ben's lifetime friend/co-worker, Kevin Smith.  And if you're a Kevin Smith fan you'll love his appearance as a forensic assistant.  I think Kevin was the only person to use a swear word in the movie.  And fitting it was.  Being that his movies are mostly curse words and vulgarity (not to say that's bad).Although I did not see ""Spider-man"", I'm going to assume that ""Daredevil"" is somewhat similar to it.  I think that's a fair assumption.  The reason I gave this movie 4 stars, and not five, has to do with Kevin Smith.  Being the big Smith fan I am, I was disappointed to hear that his next project ""Jersey Girl"" was to be delayed.  It was delayed because Affleck wanted to play the parts in ""Daredevil"" and ""Jersey Girl""; yet this one came first.  Call me shallow or call me stupid, but I don't think that's a way to treat a friend, or a girlfriend (Jennifer Lopez will be co-starring with him in ""Jersey Girl"", out this summer).  Anyway, you should see ""Daredevil"".  If you enjoy Ben Affleck, action or comics, then this movie is definitely for you.  It's a great action-packed movie with a great cast; and it's one of the best comic book stories I've ever been a part of.  Honest.",N/A
777040,"Movies don't usually have much of an impact on me -- well, the Zapruder Film did, to some degree -- but most often I just go to the theater, eat the popcorn I smuggled in (to avoid horrendous prices) and allow my mind to relax for awhile in the dark.I fully thought ""Alex and Emma"" would simply be another of those relaxation films for me -- until it reached the ending.  I was absolutely flabbergasted by the quirky, out-of-the-blue turn of events the screenwriters engineered at the conclusing of this delightful comedy.

I can't beleive i missed the giantic breathtaking fight between Neo and 100 Agent Smiths in the theatre!! But i did get to see it, and its like my absolute favorite fight ever. The camera angles are the best, and the moves and MUSIC are THE BEST EVER. The car chase part was also very well done, it reminded me of Bad Boys II. Nobody matches up to Agent Smith, he's the coolest and slyest villian ever. The dance/sex scene in Zion was kind of queer, though. I never expected that part, and it was not like the matrix.But, as i watched the movie, it began to seem less and less like the matrix. The ""orgy"" part was like some kind of semi-porno movie, the neo/smith fight was like a Power Rangers fight, the freeway scene was like Bad Boys II, Morpheus's speech in Zion was like Braveheart, and Neo flying was like freakin' SUPERMAN! Although i must say it was pretty cool.The DVD special features were great, especially the MTV Movie awards skit that featured Justin Timberlake as himself, Seann William Scott as Agent Smith/Scott and himself, Wanda (from ""Wanda at Large"") as the Oracle, Keanu Reeves as Neo, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and (drumroll please) WILL FERREL as the architect, who was HILARIOUS!

727412,"A landmark film in 1961, it brought homosexuality out into the open.  Well written by Janet Green and John McCormick, the plot tells of a blackmail ring that involves the lives of many ""victims"". Peter McEnery is a young gay man who is blackmailed and is desperate to avoid his blackmailers and the police.  Dirk Bogarde, in a daring move career wise, plays the closeted barrister  Melville Farr who had a brief liasion many years ago with McEnery.When McEnery needs his help, Bogarde rebuffs him which results in tragedy for the young man. As character after character become embroiled in this crime their lives start a downward spiral.  Everyone in the film becomes a victim of this heinous crime.Filmed in black and white against a grey London winter, the cinematography sets the right mood. Dirk Bogarde took quite a risk to play Melville Farr.  Homosexuality was still very taboo and could have broken his career.  Instead it opened up many more serious parts for him.  His performance is intense and very downplayed. Sylvia Syms, as his loving wife, matches Bogarde's performance in quality.  Her part could have become a bit melodramatic but Syms and director Basil Dearden avoided that pitfall.This film also reminds viewers of the narrow thinking that prevailed in the early 60's.  This was before Stonewall and Gay Liberation.  In England you could be imprisoned for many years. The law was repealed in 1966.

I had absolutely no idea that it'll leave me sobbing after all the laughters I've had by watching it.Guido, lives in Italy and he's a remarkable man with great sense of humour. He meets his principesa by accident and soon she becomes his wife and gives birth to a very bright boy. Then the bloody Nazis show up - Guido and his son are taken away in the camps and then Guido's wife joins their fate too but she's kept seperate from them.Guido is a very caring father to his son and from the very beginning he keeps telling him that this is only a game so he wouldn't get scared from this absurd but most of all so his son couldn't get killed by damned Nazis.I've probably seen hundreds of movies on Jews sufferings. I must have read hundreds of books too - sad ones that would break my heart into zillion pieces but only after I've watched this movie I realised that I lacked the 100% sympathy to Jews for what they've gone through from sadistic Nazis. God damn them.I know from my own experience that wars and racial hatred are totally wrong but it was only this movie that really taught how bad wars can really be. Just how many nice,remarkable,full of life people like Guido were killed in wars until now?!?I wonder will they ever stop...and in case they don't I truly hope there'll be wars in which Greed,Hate,Jealousy and Fear would get massacred - not people. Only then Life would have been beautiful.",Life Is Beautiful La Vita E Bella  VHS
742800,"Mike Love is his usual dork-on-speed self, talking over song endings, making light of certain songs, and just generally being and idiot on stage. Dennis Wilson looks completely wasted and manages to stumble through half of the bands material. (even making a mistake with a false ending on a song) Brian looks, and acts like a zombie pounding chords on the piano. (You even get to read Al's lips as he walks over to Brian to  and ask if he's okay). The DVD is really a glimps in the dysfunctional family that was the Beach Boys, and a bit surprising that it was not edited heavily to remove all this stuff. But it was not, and that's why I respect the Beach Boys a lot, they didn't try and hide their dysfunction, they wore it loud and proud because they really had no choice, but they carried on. Kudos to them. At one point duirng the show Mike Love speaks to a dazed Dennis who seems to ignore him, so Love starts to move in closer very quickly to Dennis, just then Carl grabs Love by the arm and stops him. It's all very low key, I don't want to seem to sound like they're coming close to fisticuffs on stage, but everyone knows Love is an agressive, dominating personality, as well as the shortcomings of Dennis Wilson as a professional performer being well documented, as is Mike Love's short temper and lack of tact. Al Jardine gives a terrific performance handling the vocals and rythm guitar. Carl Wilson gives a stellar performance singing and playing guitar. What does this mean? Nothing, just get the DVD its a good, good show.","Beach Boys: Good Timin - Live at Knebworth, England 1980"

745455,"The greatest and most influential of all professions is that of a teacher, but more often than not, they are the most underappreciated and underpaid people in our society.  &quot;The Emperor's Club&quot; is a movie for us all, but more specifically, for the teacher and mentor.Kevin Kline plays Mr. Hundert, a history teacher at a private institution, a supremely dedicated and honorable man whose desire it is to mold young minds into men of great character like Plato, Hypocrites, and the Caesars.Again, the opening day at St. Benedict's delivers Mr. Hundert a raw group of boys from differing backgrounds and cultures, all needing special attention from the master teacher.Off to a fine teaching start, Hundert receives a new student, the infamous Sedgewick Bell, son of a popular U.S. Senator, who becomes the professor's special reclamation project.  Against the request of the Senator `not to mold Sedgewick's character,' Hundert becomes obsessed to the point of compromising his own values, and excluding some of his other students.What will become of Sedgewick?  Will he win the coveted Mr. Julius Caesar Award, marking him as the most distinguished student of his school in ancient Roman history?  More importantly, will Mr. Hundert make an impact on the young man's life?""The Emperor's Club"" is a good movie containing some interesting twists and turns, starting slowly, yet finishing strong.

610749,"I honestly expected more from this film. I had spent many minutes watching teasers for this film, because I had to sit through previews at movies. I thought it looked imaginative. Although this was the case in terms of visual effects, the story was sub-par. At best.I love Pixar, and in my opinion they make the best films for Disney. My favorite of which was probably A Bug's Life. My review was most likely swayed by the masses of little kids and rock head parents.In the beginning, Marlin, Nemo's father, is having a conversation with Nemo's mother. Nearly instantaneously, a barracuda comes out of no where. In a dash to save her eggs, the mother lunges for a cave. Marlin tries to stop her, but is attacked by the large fish. The scene fades out, and fades in on Marlin. Plug your ears for this. On top of the fact that there are no funny scenes for the next fifteen minutes, let alone the rest of the movie, you will be swamped by nearly twice that time by kids asking their parents 'Where are the eggs? Where is the mother?' I felt like turning around and yelling in their faces ' She's dead! Can't you read between the lines? Jeezus, you would think the your parents wouldn't take an infant here!"" And the scary part is, I like kids.On top of this, there is no 'bad guy'. This movie floats along for two hours on a course for no where, like a piece of driftwood with holes, plot-holes, that is. Later on in the movie, Willem Dafoe's character, some forgettable fish whose name I have already forgotten, tells Nemo that 'All drains lead to the ocean.' WHat the hell is that? Drains lead to water processing factories where all waste, i.e. Nemo, will be burned in an incinerator.All in all, the reason this is even entertaining is the attention to detail. I give serious kudos to the animators.",N/A
355737,"No other word could possibly describe this film than masterpiece. Almost any adjective would be an understatement, but I will try to describe here in words what is one of the greatest works of art ever created.It is no coincidence that of all the films I have seen, appreciated, and cared to review, only Frances and the 1937 version of Camille starring Greta Garbo share my opinion as being masterpieces. What makes Frances one of the best movies ever made? I could go on and on about Jessica Lange's brilliant, career-defining, tragic portrayal of the misunderstood heroine (which is at the very heart and soul of this film). I could describe in detail the wistful, beautiful, epic score or the powerful cinematography and supporting performances. At the very center of this film, however, is a genius screenplay. Perhaps long, weakly edited, but the lines and quotes - the unforgettable images, tragic love, and beauty conveyed in the words stand alone as a morally edifying, eye-opening, and cathartic work of drama. It was the reinvention, the renaissance of melodrama and it is dazzling.Lines will linger in your memory forever. Jessica Lange's immortal cry to Harry, ""Sometimes I wonder if anybody really loves anybody."" Or Lange's biting and true remark to the psychologist who takes away her freedom, ""Do you really think you know more about what goes on inside my head than I do?""Frances was a dreamer at heart...a brilliant nonconformist who paid the price of a society expecting everyone to be the same. She was punished because she was different...because she had a mind and a heart. She no longer had any rights as a person - as an individual.When Frances attempts to break away from the mold..from the Hollywood lifestyle that was ""killing"" her inside, her mother interferes and purposely has her committed to an asylum. Her only love - Harry - helps her escape, but by the end of the film we see it is too late for Frances to find happiness. Her life was stolen.The most emotionally stirring part of the film is when Frances receives the lobotomy.  We know she will never be the same dreamer that Harry fell in love with.  We know that she will never, in fact, be able to love again, having her emotional and imaginative abilities ""flattened"" by the procedure. And this is the tragedy and main point of Frances - no one has a right to take away these very basic, natural human freedoms. The right to love. The right to think for oneself and be an individual. As the movie shows, even parents - who are supposed to love unconditionally - may have motives of their own and be responsible for the emotional destruction of their children.The tragedy lies at the very end. Frances is, more than anything else, a love story. We remember Frances gazing out the small door window of the sanitarium, trying desperately to touch Harry - who we sense she deeply loves. And that is why she refuses to drag him down with her. In her mind, ""nobody can screw things up like I can."" And she can't let that happen to Harry, too, because he's the only thing that has ever been constant in her unstable life.When, at the end of the film, it becomes clear that Frances no longer has deep feelings for Harry (due to the lobotomy), we realize that society has taken away her greatest freedom of all--her freedom to love. And at this painful discovery, one can only weep for the tears Frances has inside but will never cry again.",N/A
266188,"This movie is amazingly just as good as the fourth one.It has even more action as well with the new charecter Boba Fett, the bounty hunter who is paid to track down the Millenium Falcon.He's a big charecter.It has the same charecters as episode 4 minus Obi-Wan.They're all great as usual especially Darth Vader (James L.

312381,"I have yet to see the 'Citizen Kane' disc (which I have heard a lot of good things about), but I will tell you what;  this is far and away the best treatment of an older black and white film I have seen as yet on DVD.  It almost looks as if it could have been filmed yesterday!  The astounding quality leaves any recent VHS releases in the dust - especially the decrepit, well worn old Czech copy which, not all that long ago, was thought to be the only surviving print.The film itself is very British and quirky and odd, and carries itself off as a spooky mystery most of the way through.  Mr. Karloff is mostly in the first ten minutes and last twenty minutes of the film, and it is not a role that gives him too much to do except sport a creepy Ardath Bey-esque makeup job and run around being.....well, ghoulish.  Some good vintage black &amp; white horror style graveyard goings on throughout.But the real highlight here is the DVD itself.  For a relatively minor production from what I believe was a low budget film company which was probably filmed on lower grade stock and lacking in the technological advances that the larger studios  boasted back in 1933, this is really something.  Someone put a lot of care into this restoration and it shows.No extras to speak of - which may account in part for this disc's remarkable affordability as well.  After watching this - especially if you are a vintage horror die hard who has already sat through a few creaky, muffled VHS viewings of this once almost forgotten gem and you have something to compare this fantastic DVD to - any future DVD releases of ANY vintage black and white film will be held to a higher standard.  Here's hoping that someday, the original version of 'King Kong' looks as good on DVD!",The Ghoul VHS

With this video, I got so confused with all the turns, side steps and step-ups at awkward angles, that I couldn't keep up with what they were doing. It was very frustrating.

718862,"After an unexpected delay, Image Entertainment has finally released the full-version of War and Peace on DVD.  And what a collection it is!  The entire film is spread out over 4 discs in a serialized fashion with each disc dedicatated solely to a specific portion of the film.  Additionally, each disc contains cast biographies, notes on relevant history, architectural drawings, and more.  The fifth disc contains lengthy interviews with the production staff as well as original ""documentaries"" on the making of the film.  All in all, an impressive package indeed.So, how is the movie?  When I first sat down to watch it my first thought was ""What am I doing?  A six-hour Russian film that is almost 40 years old? Is this going to be interesting at all?""  Surprisingly I found the film to be very engaging and held my interest throughout the 6 hour 43 minute running time.  The photography is excellent, the acting is very realistic, and the enormity of the production does bring moments of ""Oh my god!"" every now and then.  (Seeing 50,000 extras in costume while a battle rages is very impressive!)  But the film is not for everyone.  It does lack the polish of the traditional Hollywood film and the story is sometimes difficult to follow.  The director's style would go from melodrama to experimental with multiple images, odd camera angles, and strange compositions.  (You can definitely see the influence of Abel Gance's Napoleon.)  The battles scenes are the most impressive portions of this film, perhaps of any film to date, and are worth the cost of this disc alone.The quality of the transfer is excellent despite its flawed film source.  The audio is up-to-date with excellent 5.1 sound separation and strong bass for those booming canons.  Since the disc is not region encoded (for worldwide distribution) it contains multiple audio streams and an enormous amount of subtitle choices.  The English audio & subtitles are flawed.  The English dubbed version has many scenes that are not dubbed but contain English subtitles over the Russian language.  (The liner notes say this version on DVD is the restored version, including originally censored scenes.  My guess is that the non-dubbed parts are these restored scenes.)  As for the English subtitles that appear over the Russian language, they appear to be accurate but often do not materialize during French speaking scenes.If you have any interest at all in this film, I would strongly recommend this new and definitive release.  At 6+ hours, five discs, and a film production that will never be duplicated again, this is a purchase that will not go unappreciated.",N/A
212677,"Hoping to cash in yet again on the heels of the hugely successful second ""Star Trek"" film, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"" (1982), Paramount Pictures produced a third film for the franchise entitled ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"".  This third film took on a new dimension by being directed by the actor who had played the character of Spock for over 10 years, Leonard Nimoy.  This was not Nimoy's first time in the director's chair as he had previously directed two episodes for two different TV series, but it was his first directorship of a big-screen motion picture.  Joining Gene Roddenberry again for writing was Harve Bennett, who had helped to write ""The Wrath of Kahn"", as well as Leonard Nimoy, whose writing was not credited.Though Spock's character was killed at the conclusion of ""The Wrath of Kahn"", the door remained open for his potential return since his body was left on the Genesis planet, which was a living planet created out of lifelessness.  Still mourning Spock's death was the U.S.S. Enterprise crew: Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Commader Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  Kirk is visited by Spock's father, Vulcan Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard), who inquires about Spock's soul.  After a mind meld that confirms that Kirk doesn't have Spock's soul, the two review the events just prior to Spock's death and realize that Dr. McCoy has Spock's soul.  Sarek explains Dr. McCoy must be brought to Mount Seleyah on Vulcan along with Spock's body in order for both to have peace.  Placing his friends above everything else, Kirk and the other primary Enterprise officers decide to steal the Enterprise to return to the Genesis planet, which Starfleet Command has made a forbidden destination.  Having been heavily damaged in the battle with Kahn in the previous film, the Enterprise was decommissioned, but Scotty manages to secretly prepare the ship for departure.  Meanwhile, the Genesis planet is under study by Kirk's son, Dr. David Marcus (Merrick Butrick), and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis); but a determined Klingon captain, Captain Kruge (Christopher Lloyd, known more being the 'Doc' in the ""Back to the Future"" films), wants to obtain the Genesis technology for the Klingon Empire.  The development of the Genesis technology by David Marcus and his mother, Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), was a feature in the previous film ""The Wrath of Kahn"", but Bibi Besch did not appear in this third film.  Also, Lt. Saavik, whose character was introduced in ""The Wrath of Kahn"", was played originally by Kirstie Alley (best known for her character of Rebecca Howe in the long-running TV series ""Cheers"").The most memorable scenes in ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" include Sarek's visit with Kirk, McCoy's occasional Vulcan behaviors, McCoy's conversation with an alien (Allan Miller) in a bar, Lt. Uhura's conversation with 'Mr. Adventure' (Scott McGinnis), the Enterprise leaving space dock, David's fight with a Klingon (David Cadiente), the abandonment of the Enterprise, the end of Kirk's fight with Kruge, and Mount Seleyah with T'Lar (Judith Anderson).  With Leonard Nimoy absent during most of the film, much of the action depended primarily upon William Shatner, who is not the greatest actor.  The best acting in the film came from James Doohan, DeForest Kelley and Mark Lenard.  Sadly, the sets used for the Genesis planet were not very realistic and much of the action that takes place on its surface was not particularly memorable.  The unexpected Vulcan boy who ages rapidly was played by four different actors: Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis.Overall, my rating of for ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" is only 3 out of 5 stars because of the lackluster acting during much of the action scenes, poor set design, and anticlimactic ending.  The film does have some good points and is worth watching, but could have been much better in my opinion.  I don't necessarily recommend purchase of the film on DVD, but it does fill in the gap between ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"" and ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"", which are two of the franchises best films that were ever made.",N/A

Fun in the sun turns to the slopes with great songs, funny moments, and witty dialogue mixed in with childish nonsense that you can expect from all beach movies. The Rats aren't in this movie, and ""Freddy"" (who was Bobby in The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini) is the best and sharpest beach movie bad guy out of all of em. Robert Q.

282296,"Charles Bronson (1921-2003) left us a legacy that spanned nearly five decades of acting, in many different styles. Though good at comedy as well as drama, he will mostly be remembered as a tough and gritty man of action, remaining very macho and attractive way into his gnarled, craggy later years, never losing that perspicacious glint in his eyes, or his masculine appeal.&quot;The Mechanic&quot; is one of his best; a unique film with a taut script by John Lewis Carlino, that remains interesting after many years and many viewings.The first memorable 15 minutes of this film are silent except for the tense, eerie score by Jerry Fielding, and set up the character of Arthur Bishop, who is a hit man with expensive tastes and a heart of steel. It is a part that fits Bronson like a velvet glove, with its complexity, bravado, and action sequences, which are well paced by director Winner, and photographed by Richard Kline. Jan-Michael Vincent is excellent as the cocky, cold-as-ice young man Bishop takes on to teach his &quot;trade&quot;, and Jill Ireland (who was married to Bronson for many years) does well in a miniscule part.Michael Winner made several films with Bronson, another favorite being &quot;Chato's Land&quot;, which is an unusual, and very special Western.The intricacy of the plot will keep you guessing; this is not your typical, predictable action movie, and like most films made in the '70s, it is fun to watch, with its nifty fashions and slightly tacky d&eacute;cor.A must see for those that like intelligent thrillers, and a great film to celebrate Charles Bronson's life and talent",N/A

297089,"I was so surprise by this little known Robert Altmas film because I had read such varied things about it.  I wouldn't have even bothered had I not read the Raymond Chandler book of the same name a few years ago.  It was my favorite Philip Marlowe novel and the longest.  The movie itself has traditions in the old noir and the contemporary 1970s.  The novel itself was already 20 years old when they shot the film, and the screenwriter Leigh Brackett co-wrote the BIG SLEEP starring Humphrey Bogart as Marlowe.  Here Marlowe is out of his time.  He even drives a vintage 1940s car in 1970s Los Angeles.While other Marlowe films are pretty consistent with the novels, The Long Goodbye changes a number of things around.  There characters are pretty much the same with some additions.  There is still the same business with the $5,000 bill, but it is handled in a completely different way.Elliot Gould is a strange but inspired choice for a 1970s Marlowe.  He has no office in the world of Altman/Brackett, and he takes his messages and phone calls from a local bar.  As in all these stories, there are two mysteries that really wrap into one big mystery.  Jim Bouton, the ex-baseball player famous for his book Ball Four, plays Gould's Pal, Terry Lennox, the character the whole movie revolves around.The DVD has two excellent documentaries.  The first is a look back at the Long Goodbye with interviews from Altman and Gould.  The second is a look at the cinematography of the Long Goodbye with conematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond.  There is also a magazine article reprinted on the DVD about the look of the film, the theatrical trailer and some radio spots.If anyone is a fan of Altman Gould or even Raymond Chandler, this is a much under rated film.

For one thing, he seems incapable of speaking anything but irrational gibberish as his conversation consists of little more than wildly scattered fragments that resemble the stream of consciousness speech patterns of a schizophrenic. The man seems incapable of clear thinking or precise expression. When he isn't making a smug fool out of himself by trying to take some artistic high road with a reporter because Time magazine ""only prints facts - that's all they do"" (in Dylan's confused mind, this is a fault in a newsmagazine?), Dylan is verbally abusing and harassing anyone within shouting distance: a science student who is subjected to Dylan's contempt and warped existential interrogations, his guests at a party because of a broken glass, reporters, etc. Dylan comes across as a spoiled brat, a boor; a self-important, self-righteous creep; a curmudgeon, a man whose mind seems to be in total chaos.

354475,"Thanks to writer Armistead Maupin, 28 Barbary Lane has become one of the most famous addresses in San Francisco; but it is fictitious.  The address is the location of an apartment building created by Maupin when he began writing a fictitious weekly serial called ""Tales of the City"" for a local San Francisco Newspaper called the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" in 1976.  After 13 years of weekly installments, Maupin converted them into a collection of six books.  The first book, named ""Tales of the City"", was turned into a 6-hour TV miniseries by the BBC in 1993.  When it aired on PBS in the U.S. in 1994, it caused quite a controversy not only for its honest depiction of gay characters, but also for showing men kissing one another and frequent drug use.  The story's main character is the eccentric owner/landlady of the apartment building, Mrs. Anna Madrigal, played by the very talented Olympia Dukakis.  Mrs. Madrigal is a free spirit choosing to live life to its fullest, including the growing of marijuana that she shares freely with her residents.  Her residents are also a very interesting set of people including Mona Ramsey (Chloe Webb), Michael 'Mouse' Tolliver (Marcus D'Amico), Mary Ann Singleton (Laura Linney), Brian Hawkins (Paul Gross) and Norman Williams (Stanley DeSantis).Taking place in the mid-1970's, the story begins with Mary Ann deciding to remain and move to San Francisco while visiting from the Midwest.  She finds an advertisement for an available apartment at 28 Barbary Lane.  She goes there, meets Mrs. Madrigal and immediately moves in.  Mary Ann then finds a job as a secretary for the very wealthy Edgar Warfield Halcyon (Donald Moffat), who also employs his son-in-law, Beauchamp Talbot Day (Thomas Gibson).  Beauchamp's marriage to Edgar's daughter, Deirdre Denise 'DeDe' Ligon Halcyon Day (Barbara Garrick), is rather dysfunctional with both engaging in extramarital activities.  Mona also works for Edgar Halycon, but gets into trouble with her outspoken views.  Mona and Michael, who is gay, become very good friends and spend a lot time with each other.  Over the course of the story, ties between many of the residents of 28 Barbary Lane and their common acquaintances (but not necessarily known) are shown.  One of the common acquaintances is Dr. Jon Philip Fielding (Bill Campbell), who is De De's gynecologist, but also knows both Beauchamp and Michael.  Other well-known actors played minor roles in the miniseries including Ian McKellan (known more as Gandalf in the ""Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy), McLean Stevenson (known more as the bumbling C.O. Lt. Colonel Henry Blake in the 1972 TV series ""M*A*S*H""), Rod Steiger (known for many roles including Komarovsky in the 1965 film ""Dr. Zhivago""), Swoosie Kurtz (played in the 1988 film ""Dangerous Liaisons"") and Janeane Garofalo (played in the 1997 film ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"").  Armistead Maupin also makes a brief cameo appearance as a writer in a window.Overall, ""Tales of the City"" was very well done by the BBC and I rate it with 5 out of 5 stars.  Sequels to the series were made later, but not all of the original actors reprised their roles to the disappointment of many fans.  The two actors most commonly missed in the later sequels are Chloe Webb and Marcus D'Amico, whose roles as Mona Ramsey and Michael Tolliver were replaced by Nina Siemaszko and Paul Hopkins respectively.  Admittedly, the chemistry that existed between Mona and Michael with the original actors in ""Tales of the City"" did not come across as effectively with their replacements in the sequels.  Of the two miniseries sequels, the first (""More Tales of the City"") is better than the second (""Further Tales of the City"").  Each is based on the second and third of Maupin's books.",Tales of the City - The Complete Series VHS

730425,"I absolutely love &quot;Good Times - The Complete First Season&quot;! I have watched this show on television for years and have always loved it. The show was cancelled when I was an infant, but I was fortunate to watch it in re-runs while growing up. It was interesting to see how a working class black family living in the projects could rise about all of their struggles and manage to be a loving family. The lessons taught in just about each episode are not blatant, but you definitely get the point, whether it's from Esther Rolle's loving character, Florida Evans, or the stern father James Evans, played perfectly by John Amos.I love this DVD set because I can not only watch all 12 episode from the first season, but I can also pick and choose which episodes I want to watch.I would highly recommend this DVD to any fan of good television! I can't wait for the second season to be released. This is definitely one show I want to collect! Buy this DVD set!",Good Times - The Complete First Season

His jokes only focused on 1 primary area and that is how women and men are different.  For 90 minutes it is one long run on joke that gave me a few chuckles in between.

123716,"Shane is the title of the movie, and the main character of this well-made Western. Alan Ladd plays a quiet stranger - wearing buckskins and a gun at his hip - who wanders into a Western community where a range war between farmers and ranchers is about to play out. The farmers' leader is Joe Starrett, played by tough, reliable Van Heflin. He wants the farmers to hold fast to their land, to stand up to rancher Rufe Riker and his hired hands.Shane puts away his buckskins and his gun and takes a job with Starrett. He does odd chores around the Starrett homestead and strikes up a relationship with Starrett's boy Joey and Joey's mother.But there is always the dark shadow of Riker and his men trying to push the farmers off their land.Shane obviously has a violent past, made clear by his ability to handle a gun and to defend himself with his fists. Though he signs on to work for Starrett, it's clear that his ways are really closer to those of the ranchers than to those of the farmers.Shane's need to use his gun again provides the climax and the ending of this Western.",N/A

715627,"Fans of Bigfoot movies will probably like this one, but it is not in the least bit scary and yes the bigfoot creature does look just like a man in a suite.Essentially ""Creature From Black Lake"" is about two young anthropologists who are given a grant to go look for a bigfoot type creature in Louisiana. Along the way there is lots of corny segments involving girls and a run-in with the law. In the end they manage to track down bigfoot and end up in a bid for survival.There is really only one good thing about this movie - Dean Cundy does a great job of the cinematography. Apart from that it is extremely cheesy and is only for bigfoot completists that must have everything. If you want to see a good cheesy Bigfoot movie then see ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" instead.",N/A
610042,"I was an extra in this film. I live in Huntsville, Texas, and I played an anti death penalty protester. Now, I'm a liberal in real life and also against the death penalty (probably the only person IN Huntsville who is, it seems sometimes), and even though the message of the film seems very anti death penalty itself, the film's moralistic, preachy message made me uncomfortable. If I wanted a sermon, I'd go to church. This is typical, liberal Hollywood propaganda. If I want to see a film addressing a controversial issue, I prefer for the film to use valid points from BOTH sides of said issue, in order to gain more understanding of what is being presented. This movie not only preached, it was mind-numbingly BORING, and the ""twist"" was easy to figure out way, way before it was revealed. It's the kind of manipulative Hollywood tearjerker that tries to make the audience sob and howl at the ""poor plight"" of this wrongly accused man, and it's shallow, pointless, EXCEEDINGLY cliche (ripe with horrible dialogue), and did I forget to mention BORING? I had fun as an extra, and I was looking forward to seeing it, but ultimately I am disappointed. Not to mention, Kate Winslet was a complete and absolute spoiled primadonna, VERY hard to work with, and totally self-centered. But that's another story.",N/A
767547,"Mystery of the Batwoman has made quite a bad reputation for itself since its release a decade ago. I'm not really sure why, or if it deserves the fanboy hate, but one thing is for sure - it killed the Bruce Timm/Alan Burnett Batman continuity that began with the TV series back in 1992. Kevin Conroy has returned as Batman in a few video games but there has been no proper Batman animated movie since this one (unless you count Public Enemies, where he shares half of the screen time with Superman).The Penguin is in the midst of setting up an arms deal with Carton Duquesne, Rupert Thorne, and Bane when the sudden appearance of a new crime-fighter in the shape of Batwoman causes them all sorts of grief. Not taking kindly to his image being tainted by an unaffiliated vigilante Batman sets out to discover who she really is.It's a decent plot, but never feels moody or atmospheric. The gothic pathos of the animated Batman entries that fans are familiar with is strangely absent/muted. However there are some good action scenes and a nice twist half-way through that might seem a little redundant on repeat viewings. The animosity it has gathered since 2003 is a little hard to justify, it's still better than Sub-Zero.The Blu-ray is a marginal disappointment. It IS a great improvement over the DVD, featuring the movie in the correct 1.78:1 aspect ratio instead of 1.33:1. The picture balance looks much better and the colors frequently pop, but there is a very strange blurriness to a number shots which feature fuzzy, jagged black outlines. It is very odd, like they zoomed-in on the original print and lost resolution as a result. It might be a fault of the animation and not the Blu-ray transfer, though if you are annoyed by such things it will lessen the overall quality of the Blu-ray for you. The 1080p transfer would otherwise be impressive if it were not marred by this unusual anomaly. The DTS HD-MA audio fares much better and sounds great. The extras have been simply ported from the old DVD and dumped with no re-mastering. Even the ads, trailers, and 'Chase Me' short are in nasty standard definition.Warner could have improved the presentation a bit, and with this exception of the aforementioned picture deficiencies it is a good upgrade on the DVD.",N/A

398180,"Okay, let's make this one as painless as possible.  Timothy Dalton is not my idea of Bond - James Bond.  On the heels of Connery and Moore how could he hope to live up to expectations.  Well, he didn't and as a result, only made two films as England's most revered secret agent.  This time out he's chasing after a drug dealer (isn't this beneath him) and is aided by Cary Lowel (of Law & Order fame) and Las Vegas favorite (Wayne Newton) playing a high class hack peddling religion.  Long story short - the script is so bad that if the film didn't have Bond it would have tanked at the box office.  As it stands, it didn't exactly cut a financial swath.MGM/UA's DVD doesn't do the film any favors.  Aliasing, digital compression artifacts, fine detail shimmering and edge enhancement are all abundantly present making for an even greater disappointment of this already bad film.  The sound has been mixed to 5.1 but it's a feeble mix that sounds more like a 2.0 surround than genuine Dolby Digital.  Extras are plentiful and interesting.  Menu design is outstanding.  MGM - please!!! - more effort on the remastering of your prints.  I really don't care about menu design! BOTTOM LINE: Wasn't worth it at the show.  Definitely not worth it on DVD.",N/A
731621,"Cowboy Bebop is only &quot;anime&quot; in the sense that it's animated and it came out of Japan.  Much like the film AKIRA (one of the few anime films I like), it's hard-edged sci-fi that goes for gritty realism.  It IS NOT ANIME in the typical sense--it lacks everything that I hate about anime, and that is why I love the Bebop!The characters are very human, and very engaging.  Spike Spiegel, the main protagonist, is a great everyman character, and his partners, Jet and Faye, both wear their roles well.  Even Ed--the most &quot;anime&quot; thing about this series--fits into the storyline, and has many moments of genuine humanity.  Best of all is Ein, though--the most realistic dog ever animated, and source of the of the best laughs in the series.All of the episodes are not pitch-perfect.  Like any worthwhile series, there are great episodes, good episodes and a few mediocre episodes (though not one truly *bad* episode).  But you'll forgive them the hollow moments, for even when one element of an episode isn't working, there's something else (like the music) that most definitely *is*.  And as a whole, it ranks up there with the best animated story I've ever seen.",Cowboy Bebop: Complete Sessions Collection

150614,"This version of Shakespeare, set in World War II era England, is an innovative interpretation that fails to live up to its potential. While Ian McKellen's Richard is cold-blooded and sly, he is more comical than menacing. The humor he puts into his role does not seem to match the more serious portrayals of the other characters.  Annette Bening, even with an American accent, is spectacular as the strong-willed Queen Elizabeth. Likewise, Robert Downey Jr. is forceful but grossly underused as the queen's brother Rivers: he really deserves a Shakespearean film of his own. Maggie Smith has a small part as Richard's mother that she makes the most of despite the fact that she and Ian McKellan seem too close in age to be a mother and son. Kristin Scott Thomas, as Richard's wife, stands around and looks gorgeous, but delivering her lines while smoking a cigarette doesn't make her a great actress.

First off, the little-seen-on-video actress Ruth Chatterton does a superlative job as Fran Dodsworth, the hopelessly vain forty-something wife of a successful American IndustrialistI love the remark Mary Astor makes to Chatterton when Fran states to the younger Edith: ""I hope I look as good as you do at your age"" - ""You're almost certain to, my dear"" replies Mary.As Dodsworth himself, Walter Huston is amazing: a brilliantly effective performance, simple, unaffected -- basking in its realism.Mary Astor is wonderful as the true blue widow Edith Cortwright. Astor plays her role with a sincere confidence and her character is a nice contrast to the foolish Fran (Who gets more ridiculously affected and flirtatious as the film progresses)Apart from the great Maria Ouspenskaya - who has one telling scene - David Niven is merely adequate here and the other supporting players (John Payne, Spring Byington, etc.) aren't particularly memorable.But Huston, Chatterton and Astor carry the film aided by William Wyler's superb direction. And that lovely semi-sentimental musical theme heard throughout doesn't exactly mar the film, either.DODSWORTH is an uncommonly adult film for the 193O's (Nineteen thirties Hollywood, anyway!)

506348,"Hell Night is definitely an above average horror flick and one of the best horror films ever made, although it is a little dark through some parts and hard to make out what is happening.The story is that to be initiated into a fraternity and sorority, four people have to stay in a reputedly haunted mansion.The legend goes that a family used to live in the mansion but the father went crazy and killed his whole family, except Andrew his son, who is now living in secret at the mansion. I don't know what he eats but I couldn't imagine him going to the local supermarket.There is a neck twisted around so the victim can see his backside here,a decapitation there. One guy goes to the toilet and comes back to bed and finds his girlfriend missing and finds the head of another woman in the bed. This same guy later on manages to climb over the gate of the mansion (the president of the fraternity warns them if they try to climb over the gate to watch their testicles) and he goes to the local police station. But it comes to no surprise that the police officers don't believe there have been any murders and threaten to throw the guy in jail for the night if he doesn't leave immediately, if not sooner.He steals a shotgun from the police station and also steals a car, almost while the owner is driving it and heads back to the mansion.The odd thing about this killer is that he gets a pitchfork in his body, gets shot with a shotgun many times and survives that, but at the climax of this flick Linda Blair drives a car, which he is on the roof of, into the gates which are hanging half way and impales him. Funny how that should kill him. It is pretty obvious that they copied Friday the 13th and Halloween when it comes to the hard-to-kill aspect.This movie was made when horror films were in their prime and they knew how to make them, and this one is no exception.Peter Barton stars in this who went on to star in Friday the 13th the final chapter and also stars the excellent Linda Blair who is worth renting or buying this movie just for her in it.

Now that I have finally seen this movie I have seen everything that is available on vhs or dvd by the great Visconti.&quot;La Terra Trema&quot; reminds me heavily of a film Visconti would make later entitled &quot;Rocco &amp; His Brothers&quot;. Both films deal with poor Sicilan families trying to make a living. Each family facing the injustice of the upper class vs the lower class. But between the two I must admit I prefer &quot;Rocco..ect&quot;. Because it seems to be more about plot. &quot;Rocco&quot; has more of a story to tell. And it's three lead characters make the the movie. &quot;La Terra Trema&quot; is a little short on plot. And the film goes on way too long. The movie is over 2 hours.&quot;La Terra Trema&quot; is about the local fishing community. About the hardships the fisherman face when trying to sell their fish to the merchants. The merchants it is felt are cheating the fisherman out of decent pay. The begining moments of the film work quite well. But the plot cann't sustain the entire lenght of the plot. If this movie had been cut down to at least let's say 1 hour and 45 minutes this could of truly been an unforgettable Visconti masterpiece. As the film is now it's an enjoyable over-long Visconti epic and has choice acting moments,by non actors, &amp; beautiful cinematography.Luchino Visconti is one of my all-time favorite film-makers. He had an unmatched talent for details. He has given us so many entertaining films such as &quot;Ludwig&quot;, to me his masterpiece. Also &quot;Rocco &amp; His Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Damned&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Innocent&quot;, his final film. &quot;La Terra Trema&quot; belongs high up on Visconti's list of films.

593889,"Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King left me in complete awe. As I saw events unfolding before my eyes it was just as I had imagined them when I had read the books just a year ago. I knew how things were going to unfold yet was still at the edge of my seat for the entire conclusion to this amazing piece of art Peter has created. It was so emotionally intense I breathed a sigh of relief right along with Frodo when the end of all things had come. The battles were so grand, they have to be seen to be believed.The film starts off a little shakey with an akward flashback to the days when Gollum was really a hobbit like creature named Smeagol. He's fishing with his friend Deagol and events quickly turn grim. I felt this was sort of rushed, smeagol had turned evil almost too quickly, this so called friendship was so easily changed. I know this is meant as a comparision for frodo and sam,but it appeared as though deagol meant nothing to smeagol in the first place. The continues the akward beginning of both two towers and return of the king, it feels as though Jackson didn't quite know how to start the last two films, but once these things are past, events really start unfolding.I am not one who is going to start  bashing other trilogies. Matrix and Star Wars are good in their own respects. This movie did have things those other trilogies were lacking. But than again Peter is adapating a book, while the others are creating brand new stories with no book to fall back on. There are moments in this movie that are perfect in every way. Many involving Sean Astin as samwise the brave. He lives up to his monicker and becomes the series true heroe. Truly earning an oscar nod, but the liklihood of those thick heads at the academy to recognize sean are slim to none. The acting wins over this effects in this movie because without these strong performances this movie would have been empty and lifeless. This movie shines with so much heart its overwhelming.The ending was beautiful. There are no multiple ending as many have suggested. The books went on for about a hundred more pages after the events at Mt. Doom so compared to the books this ending was much more straight to the point. The most important scene showing our heroes getting the credit they deserve, because in the end it was not aragon, gandalf, gimli, or legolas' victory. It was the victory of 4 small hobbits that saved middle earth from destruction.""My dear friends...you bow to no one.""A line I will cherish forever in my own mind. The smallest of us can be the greatest of heroes. Forget sad attempts at drama such as Cold Mountain, Mona Lisa Smile, or the last samurai. This is the only film that creates real drama without pan handling to the audience. It is the first of the three films that doesn't really need an extended edition to be a masterpiece. Although I do look forward to that edition of the movie. Thank You to everyone involved for this amazing film experience.""I will not say do not cry, for not all tears are an evil.""",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
