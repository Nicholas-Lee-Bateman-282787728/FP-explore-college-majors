1637845,"The cult oddity ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" is one of those rare movies that I suspect will be a complete love-it or hate-it phenomenon.  Some will say the movie is a masterpiece of originality while others will decry it one of the worst movies ever made.  Just watch, I fully stand by this prediction!  For my taste, the movie is neither extreme.  This low budget endeavor is an obvious labor of love to its makers and cast, it has some genuinely memorable moments, but it never really comes together as strongly as you might hope.  I was really looking forward to ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" because the idea really appealed to my oddball sensibilities.  I have been known to champion cult films of this type (Larry Blamire films, for example, come to mind, especially the sublimely silly The Trail of the Screaming Forehead).  Mixing science fiction with musicals with sixties era juvenile delinquents, there is certainly no lack of imagination in director Paul Bunnell's vision.  But the movie is wildly uneven and as much as I wanted to love it, it never fully connected with me.The movie starts off on a distant planet as Johnny Xavier (Will Keenan) stands trial for a seemingly bad attitude and general non-conformity.  Banished to Earth with his acolytes, we next see the group (the self-proclaimed Ghastlys) dolled up like extras in ""West Side Story"" and stomping through the desert in pursuit of Keenen's ex.  On the run, she (De Anna Joy Brooks plays Bliss) enters a desolate diner where she meets up with a innocent soda jerk (Les Williams) and a ruthless music promoter (Reggie Bannister).  When Johnny catches up with her, the movie kicks into a ambitious musical number that serves to introduce the characters more fully.  The plot, such as it is, involves a space suit that gives it owner great power.  Bliss has it, Johnny wants it.  A chase ensues.  Meanwhile, the music promoter enlists Johnny's assistance in staging a big concert with an aging music legend (Creed Bratton) and all of the principles will unite at this event.  From there, things change once again and the rest of the picture is ANOTHER chase across the desert.I just realized as I was writing this that I couldn't concisely make sense of the plot!  And maybe that's some of the problem, the movie feels somewhat unfocused as it covers a LOT of material.  As a parody of delinquent films from the 50's and 60's, the movie works.  As an homage to science fiction of the era, the results are a bit more sketchy.  As a musical, some numbers have their moments.  The only knock-out performance, in my opinion, is Bliss's drive-in seduction scene which caused me to laugh out loud frequently.  Adding Bannister and Bratton to the mix, the story gets increasingly convoluted.  Perhaps the most challenging aspect, though, is a lack of character focus.  Is Johnny X a real bad boy or just misunderstood?  The movie wants to have it both ways.Individual components of ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" can be strong.  Kevin McCarthy and Paul William cameos are fun, Bratton (from TV's The Office) is amusing.  I loved De Anna Joy Brooks as Bliss.  But in the end, the many things that I liked about the movie never came together in a cohesive way.  I know what the movie wants to be, it just isn't as successful as I might have hoped.  Still, I'd recommend it to the right audience.  It's a small film just looking to be discovered by a faithful and rabid cult of followers.  But it definitely won't be embraced by everyone!

334538,"In this review, I am going to discuss a few things: the film itself, and the controversy and relative anger surrounding the inclusion and disclusion of the song ""When Love Is Gone"" from this film.Aside from the Jim Carrey adaption, this is the most faithful film I've seen for the Christmas Carol, but yet they tamed it down enough so as to not frighten children beyond what they could handle.When I saw this movie, I was touched deeply and enjoyed every single second of the film, and I would be a bloody liar if I didn't say that this movie was a touch emotional to me, as well, probably more than any other adaption, because the Muppets are so extremely cute, and to see Scrooge mistreat them at the beginning was a little bit sad for me to see.This is a splendid film with miraculous music that I sing around the house year-round, some that, out of nostalgia, make me cry to hear those beautiful, talented voices singing them. My favorites are ""Bless Us All,"" and ""Thankful Heart."" I have the soundtrack, on CD and my iPod, and I listen to the soundtrack literally YEAR-ROUND. I wouldn't be able to enjoy my Christmas without having this movie, as it reminds me constantly that you need to help the needy and love each other. As a Christian person, this is a movie that has great morales, and I deeply enjoy the story just as much. It humbles me when I read somewhere online that the author of the book, Charles Dickens, helped the homeless, and if one knocked on his door, he would allow them to come in and share a meal with him, which makes me want to support his works all the more. If you watch this movie, you will never, ever forget what's in the movie, and what it will teach you as you watch, and the emotions are strong - happy, and sad as well.Now that I've gotten through my thoughts and my emotions on this film, I'd like to talk briefly of the controversy and anger that surrounds the popular ""When Love Is Gone"" segment from the film. From what I understand, it was in the film, but was removed for time purposes at the theatre, then restored on the VHS in some countries - it was in mine; my VHS has the song on it - and then it was removed from most DVD releases. Now, from what I understand, the fullscreen releases on DVD host this ""deleted scene,"" but it has yet to appear on the widescreen edition, and When Love Is Gone has not appeared on any Blu-Ray releases. I noticed a few reviews giving this one-star because of that, although I personally think it is unfair. Of course, I'm not here to attack anybody, I'd like to offer my insight to this: I'm not a fan of the song, personally, although I do believe that the part where it cuts, with Gonzo and Rizzo crying, and Scrooge asking the question to the Spirit, are empty without that song in there. I also think it's great that, on the DVD, we have the choice to watch the original theatrical (widescreen, without the song) version or the ""extended"" (fullscreen, with song) version of the film. As someone who's not a fan of the song, I prefer the widescreen version.When it comes to this film, can you not watch the fullscreen version of this film if you want to watch this scene, if even for nostalgic purposes. Most people who have this movie on DVD and are upset that the widescreen version doesn't feature the song, also have the film on the original VHS, which was released in fullscreen. It would be just like flashing back to your childhood if you saw the movie in the fullscreen state. I don't have a ""widescreen,"" or ""flatscreen"" TV, nor do I ever have any desire to, because I enjoy having the ""box"" for the TV screen rather than the ""rectangle"" screen, and I will always support full screen. To me, widescreen isn't a very good format. But, if I could see this film in fullscreen without that song, I certainly would.I'm sorry for rambling, but I feel very strongly about this film, and I hold it very dear to my heart, and I just wanted to let you all know how meaningful this film is to me. Merry Christmas (aww crap, it's only August...)",N/A

Mike and Sully are my favorite Disney characters.This prequel was really great, did not disappoint but exceeded my expectations. They attacked every aspect of the story in relation to the first movie.

Also, can't wait for another monsters movie, but I rather Disney doesn't rush the next one so it will be as great or even better than this one.

390966,"Edith Wharton adored beauty and order and the teetering sense that she lived in a time of great destruction and rebirth. Her greatness, to those of us who cannot get enough of her work, is that she neither manipulates nor preaches- but merely lays tender tales that prove that the conflict that preoccupies modern man simply is and that the human heart plays the part of arbiter.This presentation can boast gorgeous scenery, fashion and bling.  For that alone, it is worth watching.  The characters are portrayed with the restrained exceptional truth of a good ensemble performance with adherence to the nature of the times.  American and British differences are again portrayed with restraint and subtlety.  No point is driven home too intensely.On the whole, however, the series fails to earn 5 stars, at least from this reviewer as at times it was a bit soap operaish- which, tho I read the book years ago I imagine if I re-read it I'd feel much the same.A worthwhile watch, Mrs. Wharton  never fails to keep her reader and observers longing for more of this tale, this chapter, this scene and the adaptation proves itself worthy of her signature.",The Buccaneers VHS

1630042,"Since people have had the ability to tell stories, they've liked to scare one another. Monsters and goblins, ghouls and ghosts; it's all in good fun, or at least it used to be. Ever since William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (which is still the gold standard in supernatural terror), stories of ghosts and demons have gotten a little less fun and a lot more nihilistic. And while THE EXORCIST has moments where you can catch your breath and have a little fun with the characters, more and more films lately have been notching up the fear factor until you just can't breathe at all, and these films end up being more of an exercise in endless panic and utter nihilism than a smart and well-balanced scary movie. But every once in a great while in the horror genre, there comes a film that allows fear to creep in around the edges rather than constantly erupting all over the audience and James Wan's THE CONJURING is one of those rare films.It begins with a prologue, first detailing that this is based on a true story, starting in 1969 of the husband-wife paranormal investigator team of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) as they investigate some very creepy goings-on with a very creepy doll that has been possessed. Then, onward to 1971, where we meet the Perron family, a clean-cut cute family with mother Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and father Roger (Ron Livingston) and their five young daughters moving into an old farmhouse in New England. Everything seems idyllic until things start... happening. Loud thumping, smells of rotting meat, strange and creepy objects, tugs on the legs of the children, inexplicable brusing, until the madness implodes one night and they come in search of people that will believe them, and more importantly, help them. This leads them to the Warrens. Of this couple, Ed is the more logical and pragmatic of the couple, looking to actually leave this life behind them for a while so they can spend more time with their daughter. Lorraine is the emotional core, though, who leads with her heart and her apparent extrasensory abilities, and knows that the Perrons need them. Things go back to normal (or so it seems) when the Warrens and their investigative team enter the house, but things quickly start to go very badly for both families as the source of the mystery of this house is solved, and the house, and the evil spirit contained within, begins fighting back.What makes this film special is the nature of how things progress. Everything seems, for lack of a better term, real. It takes the ages-old haunted house tale, and makes it somewhat procedural in nature. The investigation by the Warrens and their team is something that doesn't seem to be part of many of these types of films. Everything seems to have its place. The film also allows us to care about the families by learning about them outside of just the otherworldly threat. They have everyday conversations; they have problems that people can relate to other than just sharing a paranormal event and Wan is smart enough to include those moments. It makes it scarier to the audience to have people we care about in danger rather than just showing the audience people in danger and have them try and form an emotional connection with them. This is old-school horror filmmaking and it's kind of glorious, particularly coming from the director who introduced us to the SAW franchise. Performance-wise, pretty much everyone is at the top of their game, particularly the leading ladies of Farmiga and Taylor.There are certain elements that are seem a little too pat, such as the investigation into the history of the house, but this is a pretty economical film in terms of exposition. It wants to concentrate as much on the characters as it does the mystery and the terror of the situations, another rarity in horror. If anything, this film is something of the heir-apparent to the last truly great haunted-house film, Tobe Hooper/Steven Spielberg's POLTERGEIST. It blends all of the elements of strong storytelling without going too far and leaving us without hope, as most of the modern horror films are wont to do. It also seems like it relies much more on practical effects rather than the over-use of CG effects, which is also a nice change of pace. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why this film is R-Rated. There's no real gore that you couldn't see on network TV, not really any ""suggestive dialogue"", and zero nudity. This wouldn't be a film I would invite a seven-year-old to see, but there seems to be no reason other than it seems to be made smarter and for a more mature audience than most of the PG-13 horror that tends to clog up the cinemas.THE CONJURING is one of the best haunted house films in a long time, and a film that gives us hope that people can still make scary films that are also intelligent and fun.4.5 out of 5 stars.",N/A

1634772,"First off if you already own the original ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" on the original first release DVDs than this release is not for you.This DVD set includes precisely the same content (including bonus material) as the previous full-season TNG DVD releases. Meaning there is nothing new to this release.This set includes all of the first season episodes of the show, and it get's a 4 star review because I simply do not like the new packaging as much as I liked the original first DVD release.This release is simply to put the show back in the market as the original packaging is no longer being produced.The price issue is not a big issue, if you have not bought the original DVD's than you are getting 26 episodes for about $1.80 per episode.  That is a good deal being most digital episodes sale for $1.99 or $2.99 for HD.Being a lot of the original packaging for each season is still being sold here on Amazon you could get each season of TNG with the original packaging for around $40 dollars still.  Some sale even less if you look into other buyers.  The issue becomes when you need to purchase the other seasons. The price goes up for the each original dvd release season.  There is also the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation - Complete Series""  That is listed at $287 dollars.  Now each of the new release packaging for ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" is going to sale for $47 dollars.  If you add each season up of the new packaging you end up paying $305 dollars.  So the decision is going to simply come down to WHAT packaging do you like the best? (Prices have gone WAY down since this review, making this a sweeter deal!)Do you like the new release look for ""The Next Generation"" DVD packaging?  Or do you like the older style?  If you go with the Older style packaging you will end up paying a little more for the show on DVD as some old box sets will sell for higher than $50, but if you go with the BOX set you end up paying $18 dollars less for the WHOLE show (as of now).  This new style simply allows you to buy each season individually so you don't have to DROP close to three hundred dollars right away.You could always go the other route and buy the Blu-Ray's and spend a tone more for the show.  However, that route gets you the new special features and updated graphics, sounds and picture. It will also cost you close to $450 dollars for all seven seasons.Picture:  What you are getting is the very first release of ""The Next Generation"".  While I am disappointed that this was not a cheaper way for them to put out the new enhanced editions on DVD to make it a little cheaper for others without a blu-ray player to pick up the show.  I am sure the reason was because they couldn't fit the new episodes on a DVD being it can only hold 8 gigs of data compared to 50 gigs of data on a blu-ray. This would have drove up the cost of the DVD's being they would have had to put more disk in this box set in order to give the whole enhanced show in DVD format.  This box set only has 7 disk.  The picture is fine and no real issues have come up on play back.Sound:  Not much same as the original packaging. There is stereo 2.0 or Dolby digital 5.1. No issues on play back.Overall impressions:  Not a bad release of the original show.  This is not triple dipping, like so many have wanted to point out.  If you do not own the show or if you do not own a blu-ray and you want to experience ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" this package is not a bad way to go.  Again with the availability of the original packaging and the whole show in a complete box set it comes down to what do you like better.  Do you go with the new packaging and save a little money?  Go with the old packaging and spend more for the original packaging, or just drop the whole $287 and buy the whole show at once.For all the one star reviews on this because of price, don't buy it.  No one is forcing you to buy the show, but people that do not own the show and may want to start watching the show need to know what this package really is.  If you already own the show, why would you buy it again in this package?  No one is holding a gun to your head and saying you must buy this release, all they are doing is putting the show back on the market so people might not have to buy the original packing at a more expensive price or have a hard time finding the show on DVD.It should not cost $25 dollars, that would be for a slim pack with just the episodes and no special features. This release includes all the original special features and again is simply a re-release of the original DVD set with new art work.Also for people who say ""I will wait for a few years so it will come down to my middle class budget"", my only response is ""Really""?  Forty Seven Dollars is not that much for 26 episodes.  Were talking close to 20 hours of entertainment plus special features.  An average movie cost $20 dollars to buy, and with the movie you only get at most 2 hours.  Forty seven dollars is not hard to save for a few weeks on a budget.  I know people got responsibilities, but $47 dollars for that amount of entertainment is not asking for much.  The other thing about this release is it supports the studios that made the show.  If you buy the old release's that money goes to the retailer (Which is a good thing as well), but if you go with then new packaging and it sells well along with the Blu-Ray we might see a new ""Star Trek"" coming our way on TV again.",N/A

1500312,"My wife and I like dancing movies and shows (i.e. So You Think You Can Dance) and after being dissapointed with Step Up 3d I didn't know what to expect of this movie until I watched it. The main girl in the movie started her career first on the Fox TV show SYTYCD and she is hot. The dancing throughout the movie was great, it had the kind of music I like and the plot was much better than step up 3. My previous favorite was Step Up 2 but I think after watching this one, Step Up Revolution is now my favorite. The last 10-15 minutes of the movie are by far the best of the series.A side note, I have a 3d projector with a 125&#34; electric screen and the 3d in this movie was actually really good, nothing cheesy like in some 3d movies and the 3d effects were worthwhile. Obviously not the best 3d effects I seen, but much better than some of the movies I seen lately.",Step Up Revolution

35533,"Just four months after the incredibly nuanced ""The Truman Show"", ""Pleasantville"" hit theaters featuring many similar themes.  Remarkably, it is just as good as the Jim Carrey feature.For a basic plot summary, ""Pleasantville"" begins with a sibling argument.  David (Tobey Maguire) wants to watch the Pleasantville (a corny 1950s-ish TV show) marathon, while Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) is expecting a hot date with her boyfriend.  In the fight over the remote, both teens are inexplicably sucked into the TV set and thus into the black-and-white world of Pleasantville, where everything is perfect...or is it?The hallmark of this film is that it deals with some pretty heavy social issues without getting preachy or self-indulgent.  Is the Pleasantville utopia something to strive for?  Or is it something to fear and must have some ""color"" added to it?  This is not a movie of black-and-whites, but many shades of grey.It is also just a fun movie as well.  Don Knotts plays an incredibly goofy character, and the humor of David and Jennifer trying to adapt to their new territory is often hilarious.  Basically, ""Pleasantville"" strikes the perfect balance of fun and drama.One can't review this movie without also regaling the performances of William H. Macy, Jeff Daniels, and Joan Allen in very key roles.  They are perfectly cast and given a plethora of material to work with, making every scene an important one (nothing is wasted or prolonged).Thus, while perhaps not containing quite as much gravitas as ""The Truman Show"", ""Pleasantville"" is just as good of a movie in its own right via its combination of deep themes, humor, acting, and fun.",N/A

Yet, for my generation, this movie presents cinematic technology at its finest.  The part where the ""beast"" corners the heroine and child in that shack, makes me wonder if the tyrannosaur devoured the previous inhabitants.  It is a movie where one should not read into it, rather enjoy it based on its cinematic achievements and state of the art technology then available.

Bartel and Woronov continue the fruitful partnership that solidified itself with ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"".  Terrific bit by John Paragon as a sex shop owner.

After a whole year, Jack (Mark Duplass) can't get over his brother's death, an indication this has written by a woman who believes men think like women. At the recommendation of his brother's ex-girlfriend Iris (Emily Blunt) he utilizes a remote cabin on an island in Washington state. As he arrives late at night Iris' sister Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt) is also there. She just broke up with her girlfriend and they hit it off well, in fact a little too well.Iris, for some unexplained reason, arrives and confesses to her sister her love for Jack, one that is mutual but never spoken. We wait for the moment.The movie starts out with a bunch of pretentious dialouge, including the old, ""remember when he stole a wheelchair"" flashback. The dialouge was written badly.

1522367,"On the surface, Skyfall is a really excellent movie.That's because it's a really excellent movie. If you take it as an individual movie and forget that James Bond already exists. That includes forgetting the previous two Daniel Craig Bond films. As an individual movie, it really only has one flaw: its title. The title is a lie and has nothing to do with the movie at all.Yeah, yeah, I hear those of you out there that have already seen it saying, ""But..."" (and I'm not finishing that sentence, because I'm avoiding the spoiler). It seems pretty obvious to me that the title was arrived at completely separately from the movie. Something like:""Wouldn't Skyfall be a cool title?""""Sure, but it has nothing to do with the movie.""""Well, can't we work it in somehow?""So, yeah, the ""word"" was just thrown into the movie so that it could be used as a title and has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. I felt a little bit cheated by that. But not really enough for it to take away from the movie experience overall. It's sort of like the pricker you get in your finger while picking blackberries; it's annoying, but it's not gonna keep you from enjoying the cobbler.So for the movie itself:The action was great. There was only one bit that I thought really strained plausibility (it had to do with a subway train), so that was pretty good. But, then, these new Bond films have been better at ""keeping it real"" than some of the older ones.The acting was great. Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and, of course, Judi Dench is just great. Ralph Fiennes is also in this one, and he was surprisingly good. I say ""surprisingly"" because, while he can be great, he is not always great, and this seemed like the kind of role where he was more expected to look good rather than be good, but he was quite good, and I'm glad that his character is one that will (should) be returning.The tech... well... there's a lot of computer stuff in this, hacking and all sorts of things like that, and, mostly, that was okay, but...So I was there with my IT/techie friend, and there's this scene where Q is explaining some computer something-or-other with a lot of technobabble, and my friend just starts laughing. Not LOLing or anything, just a sustained chuckle. So I know whatever he was going on about was gibberish, because my friend does the whole computer thing. I'm fairly technologically challenged (just ask my wife), so I probably wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been laughing; I mean, I don't know what they're going on about either way. Well, except for the part where I just sort of assume that it's all meaningless technobabble anyway.However, as much as I enjoyed it as an individual movie, I was more than a little let down with the movie in terms of its relationship to the other Bond films. There are two main reasons for this:1. With Casino Royale and the re-boot of the Bond franchise, they created an ongoing story line. Quantum of Solace, while not the greatest Bond film as an individual movie, was an excellent continuation of that story. It felt like they were putting things in place for something really cool, and I was intrigued by where they were going. With Skyfall, though, they just drop that whole story line and, at the moment, have no plans to go back to it. This is incredibly disappointing, and, for that reason, despite how good Skyfall is on its own, it is, itself, also disappointing.2. Skyfall feels like even more of a re-boot than Casino. There is a grasp in this one to make this Bond the definitive Bond. The Bond. An attempt to sweep away all earlier versions, while still giving a nod to them, and actually make this 007 James Bond. I can't be more explicit than that without giving spoilers, but I just want to say that I wasn't entirely happy with this aspect of the movie in relation to the other Bond movies. Casino did a fine job of updating the franchise and setting up a new sequence of movies. There was no need to go even further back and attempt to shove all the other movies aside.But, still, all by itself, Skyfall is well worth seeing.Just ignore that the time frame of the opening events doesn't quite match up, and all should be well. Maybe, I shouldn't have pointed that out, though.",Skyfall

This was more RVD&#8217;s style so it seemed he was the favorite here. There are various highlights and spots during this match and Ricardo gets involved at one point. In the end Del Rio actually got the submission here with the cross arm breaker. This was a great opening match.2.THE REAL AMERICANS VS ANTINO MARELLA & THE GREAT KHALI-this was a good tag match that was meant to put over the Real Americans. The action is good and the match is short but it is the ending that most will remember. Cesaro displays so power here that the crowd loves and leads to the victory for the Real Americans.3.[I-C TITLE]CURTIS AXEL VS R TRUTH-this was a good match in which I fell Truth looked the strongest and got over well. Axel did well as well and kept the belt but Truth looked very good here. This was not the best match on the card but it was a good one over all.4.[DIVAS TITLE]AJ LEE VS BREE BELLA-this was your typical Divas match with AJ continuing her quest to get rid of the &#8220;Total Divas&#8221; show. This was a decent bout between the two that would see Tamina get involved. AJ keeps the belt as most of us thought she would.5. ROMAN REIGNS & SETH ROLLINS VS GOLDUST & CODY RHODES-this was the match I was most looking forward to. I am a big fan of all these guys so I was all about this one right here. Dusty was in his boy&#8217;s corner while Rollins & Reigns had Dean Ambrose of course. In my opinion this was the best match of the night. From the in ring action to the fan response. The Rhodes family was fighting to keep their jobs so this was an emotional match that the fans really got behind. All six guys were excellent here with Dean and Dusty getting in on the action. This was a fast paced encounter that would see the crowd explode when Cody got the pin over Rollins.6.BRAY WYATT VS KOFI KINGSTON-this was a match that was added on Smackdown and I was all about that. I really am enjoying the Wyatt Family and Bray in particular. This is a good match with Kofi utilizing his quickness. But when Bray gets a hold of him he uses his size to his advantage. After a good but short match Bray picks up the win, also I love his entrance every time.7.CM PUNK VS RYBACK-this match came about after Ryback saved Heyman at &#8220;Night of Champions. This was a physical one from the start with Punk being relentless with his attacks. Of course Ryback is a powerhouse and it showed here. Then of course when you have Heyman on the outside you know he is getting involved somehow. This one of the best matches these two have had together regardless of how the crowd reacts to Ryback. Punk gets the win after delivering a low blow, Ryback tasting his own medicine maybe.8.[WWE TITLE]DANIEL BRYAN VS RANDY ORTON-this was a good match much like their last one at &#8220;Night of Champions&#8221;. I say this a lot but the action was back and forth which makes for a good pace. Both guys deliver here as there are several memorable moments but know as much as that ending. The Big Show makes his way down and just KO&#8217;s everybody here.BONUS1.GOLDUST, CODY RHODES & DANIEL BRYAN VS THE SHIELD-this was a good match from RAW that overall was fun. I love all these guys and they all delivered. The match ended at one as a DQ win for the Rhodes boys and Bryan but Triple H restarted it.

Definitely not an MGM film, as much of the action takes place in jail cells, boxcars and roadhouses, more in keeping with a Warner Brothers product, which it is. Not exactly a musical either, this in spite of the fact that music is the focal point of the film. Most of the characters here (incidentally, one of the characters here is actually NAMED Character, lovely Priscilla Lane) are down and out musicians, none of whom have two nickels to rub together most of the time. The lead musician is Jigger (Richard Whorf), a gifted pianist who is also something of a tortured soul, someone who lives for his artistry but tends to make bad decisions, particularly when it comes to women. BLUES IN THE NIGHT possesses a great cast, which includes Jack Carson, Lloyd Nolan, Elia Kazan (yes THAT Elia Kazan), Wallace Ford, Billy Halop (onetime Dead End Kid), Howard Da Silva and Betty Field (as the bad girl who sends Jigger off the rails). There's a lot I like about this film, brisk pace, snappy patter, vivid characters and an earthy lowdown ambiance that lends a noirish flavor to the proceedings. And the music's not bad either.

1525658,"*FILM*From the advertising done for this film, I didn't expect much, as was the case with everyone else I've spoken too about it, however, I came away form the theatre completely blown away and wanting to see it again. I was saying lines, singing the songs, replaying scenes in my head... I was immolation invested in this film from 10 minutes in. the first 10 minutes are a little unsure but the plot picks up and then continues to change direction and pace from their. This is a brilliant film; the characters are superbly developed, original and highly entertaining and full of their own unique wit and charm, the format is a concept well managed and creatively manipulated to produce unique story elements, the environments are original and also surprising and unexpected but refreshing and welcome. For a film about video games, it would have been easy to produce something that had worn out, loud and annoying characters (in a bad way Vanellope)and lazily devise a plot line were the characters jump form boring game to boring, poorly rendered lava filled game, trying to recharge some thing to save something or other, but they didn't!! thank goodness... Instead, the majoity of the film is set in the most unlikely game immaginable, and instead this film is a touching story about misunderstood outcasts!! like me!! and a beautiful bond that leaves you emotionally touched for what I think should be forever.I kinda want to stop here. I could go on for hours about how each character is uniquely hilarious and how the film itself is hilarious and how the CGI is the best yet and how its the best CGI film to have been made in many years (Possibly since the original Toy Story, citehtap si evard).

926964,"In the passionate, and passionately executed Danish movie ""The Royal Affair,"" also starring Mads Mikkelsen, the extra-marital affair between the doctor and the queen is, in truth, an innocent and brave love, crushed by the overwhelming might of the king and the Danish royal court. The love affair is innocent for the following reasons: the marriage between the Danish king and the British queen is arranged, as it used to be among royalty in Europe. Once the young queen sees the strange and offensive behavior of the Danish king, a spoiled young man who had never managed to grow up, she is deeply disappointed and begins to hate him, although she decides to bear her fate with dignity. When the German doctor (Mads) arrives, she finds out that he is a kindred soul, sharing her enlightenment ideas. The two are strongly drawn to each other, not only by sexual passion, but also by intellectual, political, and emotional affinities.  Although the queen is superficially unfaithful to the king, she does not, in my view, betray him. Her marriage to him was forced upon her, without her say or choice, and his abusive behavior frustrates her well-meaning efforts to draw him closer to her. Where there is no love, there is no betrayal.This is not the case with Open Hearts, unfortunately. (Spoilers) The movie opens with a tragic accident, which could lead to a rich, deep, and thoughtful  movie, but it doesn't. A young engaged couple, madly in love, are driving along the street. They stop to let off the young man, who is going on a hiking trip before he marries his fiancee. As he gets out of the car, he is hit by a passing car and rushed to the hospital.  The verdict is grim: as the fall shattered his spine, he will not be able to move any limb from the neck down--for ever. We feel compassion for the victims, who must pay an unfathomable price for an ordinary mistake. We pity the young woman who visits her fiance in the hospital every day, the whole day, trying desperately to convince him that they could overcome the injury and share some kind of life together. The man responds to her plea with unmitigated, and sometimes sadistic, anger. Filled with self-pity, he rejects her approaches and orders her not to see him again. (Couldn't he be a bit nicer?) She is crushed.This opening is very promising. However, what happens next reduces the film to melodrama. Mads Mikkelsen plays one of the doctors in charge of the injured young man. (It was his wife's car, incidentally, that hit the young man.) In her panic, the young woman turns to him for support and comfort. We are also obliquely informed that his sexual relationships with his wife have vanished long before. Why, we are not told. Is it just a weakening of the sexual flame between long-married partners, or is there a deeper conflict, or hostility, between the two? Well, one can see where this goes. The comfort the doctor offers the distraught and attractive young woman quickly develops into a lustful affair. All right, I understand, perhaps, why the doctor needs sex. But doesn't he know that he is taking advantage of a wounded and vulnerable woman?  And why would the young woman, who hasn't had the chance to digest what has happened to her, and who surely still loves her injured fiance, why would she leap so quickly into the arms of another man (even if he is the handsome Mads Mikkelsen)? This makes no sense to me. What is the value of her love for her fiance if she so quickly plunges into an affair with his doctor? Where are her inner conflicts? She seems to have none. Where is her self-respect? Where are her attempts to stand up, on her own, to the ""whips and scorns of time,"" as Hamlet would put it? And even if she pleads for the doctor's support, must it lead to an affair? I just don't understand why it is so easy for the doctor and the young woman to engage in such a light-headed affair so soon after the accident. Was the director more concerned with the sensational possibilities that the movie offered her rather than with the psychological truths of the characters? If fact, the only dignified character in this movie is the doctor's wife, who is also an excellent actor. At first, she feels guilty about inadvertently hitting the young man with her car and therefore encourages her husband's offers of solace to the young woman. But when she finds out about the affair, she is the one who tells him the truth about his weak and miserable self and thus presents the only moral point of view in the movie. However, she loses. The doctor insists that he is in love with the young woman and escapes his home and his children. Back and forth they go, and the ending is ambiguous.Finally, Hemingway's advice to writers is applicable to all artists. During Hemingway's conversation with Scott Fitzgerald, the writer of The Great Gatsby described how he changed his short stories for submission, ""knowing exactly how he must make the twists that made them into salable magazine stories."" Hemingway is shocked by this betrayal of art and says he ""did not believe anyone could write any way except the very best he could write without destroying his talent"" (Ernest Hemingawy, A moveable Feast, 153).  Hemingway's is a sterling counsel to the rising stars and directors of the new and often riveting Danish movies.",N/A
1659931,"BCC's Doctor Who is celebrating its 50th anniversary next month with the special ""The Day of the Doctor,"" but before then you can experience the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth doctors with today's release of Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited: Fifth - Eighth, starring Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann in four exciting adventures, Earthshock, Vengeance on Varos, Remembrance of the Daleks, and Doctor Who - The Movie, on four discs.Earthshock aired in March 1982 and has the Doctor (played by Peter Davison) and his companions (Adric, Nyssa or Tegan) arriving on Earth in the future. They explore a few caves and run into Lieutenant Scott and his men, who claim the Doctor and companions killed Professor Kyle's exploration team. The Doctor convinces Scott that they didn't have anything to do with Kyle's disappearance and offers his assistance to help with the search, leading the Doctor to come face to face with the Cybermen.Colin Baker plays the Doctor in Vengeance On Varos, which originally aired in January 1985. After the TARDIS comes to a complete stop in the middle of space, the Doctor and his companion (Peri Brown) go to Varos (formerly a prison planet) in search of Zeiton-7, which is what the TARDIS needs to run properly again. The planet is operated by the evil Governor and getting the Zeiton-7 will be more difficult (even deadly) for the Doctor.Remembrance of the Daleks first hit the airwaves in October 1988 starring Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor, who (along with his companion, Ace) arrives in Shoreditch in 1963, where they track down the strange magnetic fluctuations near the Coal Hill School, which happens to be a grey Dalek. The Daleks have followed The Doctor through time in search of the Hand of Omega; all leading to the return of the creator and leader, Davros.Seven years after the original BBC series ended, Doctor Who returned for one night on Fox and later aired on BBC One in the UK with Sylvester McCoy briefly returning to regenerate in Doctor Who: The Movie. Paul McGann took over the role of the Doctor for the made-for-television movie that finds the Doctor with no memory after the regenerations and is aided by Dr. Grace Holloway. To make matters worse, black ooze escapes from the box containing the remains of the Master and enters into the body of an ambulance driver; therefore regenerating into the Master, who is hell-bent on destroying the Doctor.Each disc has the option to watch the original broadcast version or the widescreen special feature version with an introduction by Steven Moffat. There is also a 24-minute documentary on each disc. Inside the DVD case is a set of four Doctor Who fridge magnets.I've been a Doctor Who fan since ""Rose"" aired on the Sci-fi Channel (now known as SyFy) in 2006; though I was aware of the previous incarnations, I had only seen the Doctor Who films with Peter Cushing at the time. With the 50th anniversary this year, BBC is releasing the best of each Doctor in three DVD set releases for both new and old fans. Earthshock started a bit slow for me, but the pacing picks up when the Cybermen are revealed, all leading to a shocking ending (I won't spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen the episode, but most fans are aware of who dies.) Vengeance on Varos is completely different than any other Doctor Who episode. Despite its slow pacing, it is cleverly written. Remembrance of the Daleks is the final appearance of the Davros and the Daleks in the original series run and just like other Dalek episodes, it is action-packed. I had already seen Doctor Who - The Movie, as it was released on a 2-disc set back in 2011, but there is a new documentary about the eight Doctor on this release. The movie was meant to be a reboot and a backdoor-pilot, but due to horrible marketing and a bad timeslot, it didn't put much of a dent in the ratings. I do admire the producers for connecting to the original series with Sylvester McCoy's cameo. Overall, Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited: Fifth - Eighth is a must have for any fan. I enjoyed watching each episode (or movie) and I recommend it to others.*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.",Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited 5-8

640961,"This is a great adaptation.  The acting is great and is the directing.  This story is the classic "" Pride and Prejudice"" story as told by Jane Austen once you've cut out all the exasperating and inconsequential details.  This movie gets right to the point without diminishing the theme or plot of the story.It is the classic tale of Elizabeth.  Elizabeth is smart, but loyal to her sisters.  Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Darcy is Mr. Bingley's best friend and insults Elizabeth, but is unaware that she can hear him.  Elizabeth is enchanted by Mr. Wickham.  Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy and through a series of misunderstandings on both their parts they end up misjudging both each and others.  Elizabeth finds out that Mr. Darcy encouraged Mr. Bingley not marry Jane because he believed that Jane didn't love Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth that he loves despite himself.  Elizabeth clears up the misunderstanding that Mr. Darcy had about Jane and she also tells him off.  Mr. Darcy writes a letter and explains the truth about Mr. Wickham and what a leech he is.  Elizabeth's feelings towards Mr. Darcy start to change.  Then Elzabeth's youngest and most foolish sister, Lydia runs off with Mr. Wickham.  Mr. Darcy uses his vast fortune to make certain that Mr. Wickham marries Lydia.  He also gets Mr. Bingley and Jane back together.  Elizabeth finds out about both of these things.  Both she and Mr. Darcy start telling each the truth about how they really feel about one another.  It is not hard to deduce what happens next.All in all this is a great romantic film.  Jane Austen, tends to beat around the bush too much.  This film takes out all unneccessary running around and it gets right to the point without changing the plot.  However if films where the primary focus is romance are not your thing I would advise against you watching this film.  If a person loves a good romance then I would highly recommend this film.",N/A

The most important aspect of Star Trek types movies is the building up of the story, the natural progression to the scenes with smooth transitions. Although it's a sci-fi, I expected stronger, less cheesy show. The script did not seem to have been able to keep up with the changes and the resulting expectation of contenmporary audiences of Star Trek. Of course, those who subscribe to the nostalgic aspect of the TV series, will certainly find the movie OK, even great. But I could not help thinking Star Trek in this show has remained stagnant, tied up to the seventies or early eighties mind-set. Sorry, I could not be more specific, it's late in the night.

As you would expect from the writer of &#34;Saving Private Ryan,&#34; Robert Rodat produces a very believable story line peopled with gritty characters that have all the humane character flaws of everyday people in an overwhelming situation.

Not only that, but it's probably the worst sequel in movie history.  Not only that, but it's one of the worst MOVIES of all time!  The story is lame, the plot has holes galore, it's beyond cheesy, the acting is terrible, everything is horrible.  Not much really happens in the movie as far as demonic possession, either.  The first movie called The Exorcist (1973) was a smash hit.  Just four short years later The Exorcist II redefined the meaning of the word ""dud"".

472425,"Originally released in 1999 by now deceased director Satoshi Kon, Perfect Blue managed to offer a unique animated movie experience that creates as many questions as it does answers. One thing is for certain though; any anime fan, or fans of movies in general should give this a watch, as they might not have seen anything quite like it.The film begins with 20 year old Mima Kirigue performing a concert as part of a band known as CHAM. They have a small but loyal fan base and are wholesome and innocent. However, Mima has aspirations to become whats known as an idol in Japan - famous celebrities who sing, dance, model and voice act - whilst also providing a role model to young girls in Japan. Unfortunately, many don't make it to public stardom, like Mima's band CHAM. Therefore, Mima decides to leave the band in pursuit of becoming an actor. However, Mima soon discovers that shedding her innocent image is whats required for her to be taken seriously as an actress, and soon she finds herself agreeing to be part of a rape scene in a television series. It's here that the psychological aspect comes into play; Mima begins to be stalked by a mysterious figure; she begins to dream about murder and starts to hallucinate, Gradually her psyche begins to deteriorate and we the viewers start to fall apart with her as the lines between fantasy and reality become increasingly blurry.That is the premise for the film, though in words it doesn't seem to have the same impact as actually watching viewing it. Many viewers when viewing will say "" Ah, so this part she imagined!"" or ""That's part of the movie she is in"" etc. Only for Satoshi Kon to add another layer of mystery onto what already feels like a substantial amount of mind twisting. But that is what makes this film a great one - there's something to really bite into, to ponder and speculate about that not many movies make viewers do nowadays. It provides a satisfying ending that helps to clear away some of the fog that the film accumulates. Granted, it may not be for everyone, due to the graphic violence and nudity that the film shows,and also may isolate some fans due to a few confusing scenes, but ultimately it is one i recommend highly to everyone interested.It should be mentioned though - if you don't like movies that ""mess with your head"" so to speak, then you may not enjoy Perfect Blue. If there is one thing this move excels at, then it is creating a seamless blend of fantasy and reality, often to the point where it becomes difficult to differentiate between the two. This method of directing can often get confusing, but it is not down to poor directing but due to masterful directing by Kon.It was his intention to make the viewers scratch their heads; to probe deeper and come to their own conclusion. For some, the lack of outright answers may frustrate, but I promise if the film is re-watched multiple times, then the viewer will come away every time with a new discovery made. Therefore, it is also great value for money (if you can find a cheap copy, as the ones of Amazon are pricey due to being out of print).PS: It should be mentioned that I viewed the uncut blu ray edition that has yet to be released in America. However, a release date for the Perfect Blue Blu ray has been announced for Europe in October 2013. Hopefully, an American release will soon follow.",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

438527,"11-15-2013  I'm notsure where the exact identical dvd box in these pages, but this one will do.  Anyhow, 1941 was a pretty good yer for Hollywood classics ans it onlygotbetter as the years passed.  The ""Golden Age, "" as I call it , ran from about 1935 thru to 1955.  These years saw the careers of Bogart, Cagney, Orson Welles, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda, Edward G Robinson and so many others, especially supporting actors like James Gleason, Alan Hale, Edward  Arnold,  Tim Holt,  Joseph Cotton and an even larger cluster than the front names of the leading ""Stars.""  We had directors like John Huston, Orson Welles and, of course, our man here Frank Capra.  ""Meet John Doe "" ws made early in 1941, and Capra finished it in  1946, shortly after the War was over, with ""It's a Wonderful Life..""  After having been subjected to a sneak attack by the temporarily superior Japanese military forces, we met the challenges,  rolled up our sleeves and posted  a  great  victory in 1942 at Midway.  When the tide urns against John Doe, in the movie,he doesn't give up, either.  Somehow, good triumphs  In between ""Doe"" and ""Wonderful Life,"" we got Citizen, Kane,""  "" Jekyll and Hyde"",  ""How Green was my Valley,""  ""The Maltese Falcon,""  "" Sgt. York""  and the scariest film of my boyhood, 'The Wolf Man.""  But, instead of a man-wolf killing people ,we got a good, descent man tortured by the horrifying curse of his living nightmare, not unlike the grueling hell on earth of Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa and,worse of all,  the reign of death from the sky; IGNOMINIOUS UNIMAGINABLE  MUSHROOM-SHAPED.  We all, were suddenly different, very different.  But, in 1946's ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" Capra convinced us we hadn't really changed at all, but life had simply thrown us a curve, a terrible, destructive curve.George and Mary Bailey lived happily eve rafter, as we did , once we defeated the black soul of Oriental militarism and the unparalleled vehement hatred of National Socialism, the Nazis.  Capra made war films for the military,yes, but ""Doe"" and Wonderful Life,"" were ALSO war films, the best face of war films,if  a good face is to be found.  It is there, under neath the story.An Eastern newspaper is bought by an abtitious millionaire,  with designs on the governor's  mansion, and he tries to use the Paper to manipulate the voters  into backing D.B. Norton,  (Edward Arnold.)  Barbara Standwyck is a bright, pretty and very Spunky reporter who looses her job but fighs back.  The NEW Newspaper is about fireworks, and that is exactly what she gives them.  She cleverly invents a 'John Doe""  who out  of principal, will commit suicide on Christmas Eve,  dueto  the selfish, cold and corrupt society.  A human John Doe is needed, and a hansome drifter, Gary Cooper, one of my 4 or 5 all-time favorites ,takes the job.  She writes a daily column  from Doe , and the whle nation is enthralled, and, of course,  Anne and  John have fallen in love with each other.Norton's plot,of course, is a secret and it looks like it is going to work until Doe begins to wonder, and  with the new editor's intoxicated confession  our hero is sure ,he's being used more than anyone in the country.  He tries to fess up at a dramatic nighttime  baseball stadium in the pouring rain.  His efforts to speak are stifled and the crowd angrily rejects him and his message.  Totally rejected and dejected, he disappears.  Anne looks desparately for him, only to find him really on the  roof  of City Hall, from where he has pledged he will jump to his death.  Mr. Norton, his goons and Standwyck all meet John at the same time.  This scene was filmed in a huge walk-in freezer, as all are told by  a totally honest Doe he really DOES intend to jump.  He is physically restrained  and Standwyck confesses her  great love for the real John Doe, a man named John Willoughby, a washed up minor league baseball pitcher, with a bad arm in need fs reparative surgery.  Standwyck and Cooper leave the roof arm in arm and he editor, the wise-cracking James Gleason says to his former boss, the still unmoved and ruthless Norton,  ""There you are, try licking that, Mr Norton-------THE PEOPLE!!""  As the midnight Christmas church bells ring out all over the city,an unseen choir and orchestra gently intones Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" from his 9th Symphony. ""Meet John Doe"" is  GREAT film, one the whole family can treasure.  Entertaining, funny, moving and so idealistic it is often cited a an example of ""Capra-corn.""  I could not agree more,  one of my personal TopTen all-Time movies, we watch it once or twice a year.  A classic of all classics.  everyone should own a copy of it, no doubt.  If I could, I'd give it 7 to10 Stars, but Amazon only permits 5.

1541808,"I hate to be a part of the over-hype squad, so I tried to wait for my enthusiasm to simmer-down, but no luck. I can't stop myself from saying this was hands-down the film of the year, for me, and possibly the greatest movie I have ever seen. I'm sorry if that makes you defensive or overly hopeful for something else, but this movie truly fired on all pistons.It is wonderful to go into a movie so blind to what I can expect. All I had heard was that there was a very young girl at the eye of a tornado of hype. I was neither prepared to love nor hate her. Neither the director nor the cast seemed to have any reputation at all beyond the center star and the controversy about her award nominations.So, we got this DVD in the mail from Netflix, and I was excited to see what all the chatter was about. We pressed play, and went on a wild ride. In the opening scenes I was still getting my bearing on the look of the Super-8 film, and what kind of genre I was experiencing. It looks like vintage Disney nature show footage, and initially you may be expecting a slower pace more typical of these up-close gritty films like Take Shelter. In many ways this was similar to that film with emotional highs and lows, except Beasts has a clearer fantasy element to it's plot, and the central character propels the film with her hopefulness like the tiniest Skywalker in the dingiest spaces imaginable.But, as I eased into the first hour, I felt increasingly drawn in and mesmerized by the story and the performances that propelled it, until I could hardly blink for fear of missing something.This movie is far from the slow crawl of most low-budget quirky indie films, as evidenced by the small group of critics calling it irresponsibly violent, etc. That perspective was more valid for the movie Drive (also a film I really liked), but while Drive collected together all the greatest scene elements from multiple classic suspense, gangster, and horror films, Beasts seems to rather break away completely and establish a new sub-genre, that pays homage to no other specific film.As far as the violence, critics are obviously referring to the abusive father, who slaps her, punches a catfish, etc. Although I had a fantastic father, two people very close to me had abusive fathers, that would leave to get wasted and show back up whenever they wanted with their hearts full of a passion for God-knows-what and a fleeting concern for everyone else, placing ridiculous people and priorities above the welfare of their family. His very real portrayal combined with the Super-8 camera look gave the film a slight documentary/reality-show/biopic quality.The presence of the giant pigs pushes the film into fantasy territory with a mostly subtle use of special effects. Some of the images of the pigs traveling were not as natural as I wanted, but when they arrived then they didn't seem quite so mechanized. That is truly the only negative I have to say about it.The plot had that George Lucas type effect of creating such an elaborate sense of purpose and symbolism to this alternate world, built out of very humanistic elements, feelings and ideas. It's easy to forget that sort of Ray Bradbury style sci-fi that is less focused on futurism, and more focused on turning a mirror to humanity with a ""what if"" scenario used to amplify and exaggerate reality until we can see it with new eyes.That being said, and despite all those great parts, this entire film is largely carried on the back of one amazingly hypnotic six year old girl. From the second she enters the frame, my eyes followed her like a cat to a laser pointer. The director was so good at getting out of her way, and keeping the camera angles shifting at a natural pace. With a script this poetic, a six year old actress this captivating, and a wildly belligerent supporting actor, it's hard to give the director the credit he deserves for stringing it all together, but he deserves all the future offers I anticipate he will receive, as will the rest of the prominent people involved, I hope.This is a masterclass in film making, script writing, acting, and plot design. I hesitate to say this, but right now I feel this may be the greatest movie of all time. It's poetry is pure and hope-filled, it's talent comes out of nowhere, and it's story design is so rich. For my tastes, this is as close to perfection as I could ever hope for.",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1108168,"This is a tale within a tale, limited locations and sparse sets, really the tale of two actors, one a reporter who acts out to establish himself, the other an actor that he is supposed to interview-- and both realize that the other is not fully real during the interview.Yes, wonderful writing, excellent work, but it is for the introvert, not the extrovert, and doesn't quite break through the wall into the land of great storytelling.  However this might be Sienna Miller's best work, so if you like her, this will please you.If not, Steve Buscemi as the actor/director is a good fit, and underplays the role so well that the final twist has some real bite.If action, adventure, or groundbreaking roles are your goal, sorry, but this is more filler than main course.",Interview

1059708,"BBC family shows tend to follow the same outline:  the first season is generally full of the same plot lines and have cheesy characters.  I don't know why that is - maybe the BBC only gives a little bit of money to start the show, see how it does, then by the 2nd series finally gives the show some money to hire real writers.  Just a guess.  So the thing is, you have to get past the 1st series.  I learned this when getting into Merlin - I was home ill for a week and put it on Netflix to kill the time.  I thought the 1st series was rubbish but was too weak to find another show in my feavered state.  By the 2nd series I was hooked, sick or no.  Luckily they were sill making Merlin when I discovered it.  I was not so lucky with Robin Hood - it's been off the air for several years now.  But YAY of Amazon Prime for still having it!  I've been watching it and am totally addicted.  Yeah, the 1st series was kind of rubbish - like Mcdonalds for your eyeballs, but I just knew if I pushed thru it would get good - I mean, the dude that plays the 1st Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously evil.  He plays that character so well and completely sold the show to me from episode 1, even with the rubbish writing going on around him.  My next favorite is Guy of Gisborn - I just knew they would be doing things with his character that would be astounding - and they pulled everything off thanks to the superior acting of Richard Armatage.  I when into laughing hysterics with his ""So, where do I sleep?"" line in series 3.  The dude that plays Alan is freakin awesome too - his line delivery feels like a real person talking to you, and he did a spectacular job playing both sides in series 2.  But lastly, lets not forget Jonas Armstrong's Robin Hood.  Series one he obviously got the role because of his charm, wit and boyishly good looks and he relied heavily upon that in the beginning - but who knew the dude could actually act???  I think the 1st episode of the 3rd series is my favorite - I really believed his pain.  My only real gripe is the scramble to give him a love interest.  I really could have done without Kate and wish they would have had her go with Much or Alan.  Anyway. I'm glad the show ended as it did without trying to carry on with a new cast.  That's what killed Being Human!  Anyway, it was a great show and I'm glad to see the mains going off and having extremely successful careers (see: The Hobbit).",Robin Hood: Season 1

1629958,"It's a smart movie that can draw a character capable of such savage betrayal and let the audience feel every inch of that nasty blade. None of the other characters can seem to articulate all the damage done to them, so we viewers are allowed to fill in the blanks ourselves. The other characters just fall apart as the betrayer prattles on about free love and other nonsense. This tale takes place in the 60s, everyone awash in hippy-feelings as this monstrous act unfolds. The fact that they are adrift without social and moral moorings makes it hard for them to articulate just what exactly is the wrong that has been done to them. I have a coworker who was able to do something similar, leave behind him a familial train wreck that included suicide and endless pain for everyone but him. He comes to work smiling, happy, the new young girl on his arm, and we wonder how he does it. The human capacity for self-delusion is astounding.",Ginger and Rosa

1475857,"Ridley Scott made people fall in love with the Alien films (at least the first two). Now,he really engages us with Prometheus. This film has many magnificent aspects that people will love (if they can see them). Prometheus is a really good and genuine film, but it also leaves the audience guessing too much.This movie is classified as science fiction for a reason. The plot is highly interesting and highly unpredictable. It keeps the audience wanting more. The synopsis is truly amazing. Everything that takes place in the film can be related back to one core concept. As long as viewers remember that, the film should be really intriguing. Also, this is the best aspect of the film. At the same time, it is the most disappointing. The questions that viewers watched throughout the movie barely got answered. They were really replaced by new ones. It keeps you always wanting more, even after the film. This is one of the main reasons why some viewers do not like this film. Honestly, it appears to be Scott's intention to leave the audience wanting more and it fits with one of the themes in the film. But I truly must say to clear any misunderstanding that this film is NOT an Alien film. This is not suppose to relate directly back to the Alien franchise, but it does leave bread crumbs that help viewers understand it's origins.Next, the visuals were amazing. When watching this film in HD, you will love the vividness on the screen. Unlike other sci-fi films, this film did not use heavy emphasis on computer graphics while sacrificing a strong plot. The graphics are stunning and all other aspects of the film are still great. They are realistic and not cheap looking.Finally, the actors are really good. The cast consist of Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, and other actors/ actresses.In general, this film is fantastic for those who want to see something new and different. Most current sci-fi films have weak plots and heavy use of CGI. This film is the opposite. This movie is a true changer for science fiction films with a plot that throws many questions, but leaves the audience waiting (and some frustrated by the wait).",N/A

618288,"This movie is unusual in the immense size of its cast and in its multiple-plot structure. Within a cast of about fifty people, over a dozen play starring roles.  This might sound like a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works beautifully.  The basic idea behind this effort consists of using many male-female pairs of actors to portray the many different kinds of encounters and outcomes that can occur and result when male and female humans find themselves in close proximity to each other.  The outcomes of these multiple relationships are tremendously varied and best thought of as scattered along a spectrum ranging from tragedy to ecstasy.  The movie does not present one complete portrayal, then a second complete portrayal and so on until the movie's end.  In contrast to that ""stepping stone"" approach, the movie actually introduces a bit of the first portrayal, a bit of the second and so on through to the last portrayal, then starts over with a second bit of information on the first portrayal.  In other words, the movie repeatedly ""tunes up"" the viewer's understanding of how each relationship is progressing.  Although the movie treats most of the portrayals as of equal value, it places greater than usual emphasis on the relationship that builds to a thrilling peak involving the Prime Minister of England (Hugh Grant) and his voluptuous office assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon).  In a serious portion of the movie illustrating the character of the Prime Minister's work, The President of the United States (Billy Bob Thornton) arrives and proves himself full of assumed superiority and entitlement rights to insult or flirt with anyone in his presence.  The interactions between the actors playing the President, Prime Minister and Natalie are brilliantly portrayed and leave me thinking Thornton is an acting genius, even when playing a mildly despicable person and even when he wears a John Deere cap while playing semi-dumb during interviews.",Love Actually

139800,"By most accounts, ""Moonraker"" should be a middling Bond effort at best.  The villain is weak, the plot is like tissue paper, and the acting is supremely over-the-top.  Yet, for some reason, this movie has always just provided me with some great, thoughtless entertainment!For a basic plot summary, ""Moonraker"" sees James Bond (Roger Moore) run up against Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), a crazed entrepreneur bent on conquering Earth from his space base.  Along the way, Bond enlists the help of Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), as well as the traditional orders from M (Bernard Lee) and gadgets from Q (Desmond Llewelyn).Perhaps I can stomach this movie so well because it was one of the first ""old Bond"" movies I ever saw, right when I was getting into the franchise, but I think there are a very inherent ""saving graces"" that indeed make it watchable:-The space theme, which is very different from the typical Bond fare and makes this movie unique to the series.-The character of Jaws (Richard Kiel), who is one of the most exciting Bond villains of the entire run.  He is never the ""main baddie"", but as an ""evil henchman"" you can't get any better!-Moore's lighthearted Bond can sometimes get sickening, but for some reason the shtick works pretty well in this one, getting even some legitimate laughs throughout.Overall, even though ""Moonraker"" can, at times, be the epitome of cheese-ball and eye-rolling cinema, it still can be enjoyed by Bond fans looking for ""something different"".",N/A

As I put in all my reviews, I will not disclose a lot of detail because I feel that it could ruin it for others.  With that being said:  At the beginning it started out really good. The middle was okay and the ending was extremely flat. You have a little bit of humor, and you have some pretty good action.  The storyline itself was just okay. There was a decent buildup throughout the movie and then when you start to really get into it, the movie ends.I was really disappointed with this movie. But maybe that was because of the reviews that they showed prior to the movie coming out, they were pretty hyped up and showed some really good parts.

Here, it's more a drama with some humorous scenes, released in 1927, just one year after the original play opened.  Although it's a silent film, it's probably the most visually authentic version, filmed as it was so close in time to the real events.  DeMille is not listed as the director but there are many 'DeMille touches' throughout, so can be assumed that he had much to do with making the film.  The black and white print has been beautifully cleaned up at the UCLA Film School.  The musical score (based on the original score) has been edited and recorded in modern sound, which adds immensely to the enjoyment.  In addition to the film, there are many extra features, including a short film with still photos of the real 'Roxie' telling the story that was the major inspiration for the 1926 play. There are also documentaries (made years later) about 'Flappers', the 'Roaring Twenties' and more.

1382041,"I have been spoiled by the many Italian-made movies (of the early-2000s)about saints.  This Italian film was a 1995 production that takes a different route - an artistic and at times surrealist path. As the film opens, we meet Edith Stein (Maia Morgenstern), a brilliant and spirited Jewish woman in her 30s who has converted to Catholicism.  She choses a new faith over her current love, Hans (Jerzy Radziwilowicz).The film speaks of her belief in phenomenology (a belief that something fulfills its purpose when someone uses it for its innate purpose) and of the influence of her mentor Edmund Hursserl, her internal struggles with empathy, her search for truth and her rediscovery of her lifelong religious questions.  In 1922, she begins her scholarly career as a professor of philosophy.  Her mother refuses to talk to her once she becomes aware of Edith's conversion. In time, Edith earns national fame as a brilliant philosopher and writes several books on the matter of seeking truth.  Edith is criticized by many scholars who question whether a former atheist can be reformed.  She is also tortured with memories of her volatile relationship with her former lover and colleague, Franz Heller (Jan Nowicki) who periodically shows up to cajole her.  Edith sees that Franz is now enamored with worldly truth and sees hope in the Nazi Party.  Edith scorns him for his folly.  Alone in her journey, she discovers that in seeking truth, the search will lead to God because he is the ultimate truth. Edith's hunger for a deeper relationship with God makes her realize that it is only possible through a relationship with Jesus.  As Europe succombs to Nazism, her family seeks to escape and most of it cannot understand why she has 'betrayed' them by becoming a Christian as darkness looms over the Jewish community.  She is not condemned but the relationship is strained.  Ms. Stein's mother and her sister, Rosa's object to her new faith.  Her ultimate choice to devote herself to Jesus is forced by her ouster as a professor in 1933 Germany due to her Jewish heritage. As Nazism tightens its grip on Germany, her beloved homeland, Ms. Stein refuses to leave.  Most of her family leaves for America but her mother and sister remain. She decides to become a Carmelite nun and begin her Carmelite novitiate in Cologne, Germany.  As she physically struggles with the challenging task of surviving the novitiate period and questions about her motivation from other nuns, Edith spends endless days in prayer and sorrow. She delves further into the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila, in which she encounters the God of love and the journey of the seven houses (levels) of faith (growth).  In time, she completes her training, begins writing her own treatise and gains the respect of the other nuns.  She takes the name of Sister Teresa Benedicta a Cruce (Teresa Blessed by the Cross)in 1936.  Sister Teresa/Edith Stein gains renewed fame and renewed interest from the Nazis.  Franz Heller, now a Nazi disciple re-enters her life periodically to persecute and tempt her.  In time, the Nazis force her transfer to Holland.  She leaves for Holland and awaits her fate. Sister Theresa/Edith completes her treatise just prior to her arrest in Holland by the Gestapo in 1942.  She does not fight this eventuality in spite of being scared.  As she is arrested and carted off (along with her sister, Rosa who has also come to the faith) to the Auschwitz death in the gas chambers, she sees her destiny - to die with her people.I came away with the feeling that Edith Stein experienced the seven levels of faith through her life and accepted her destiny of dying to be with Christ, her love.  But, she died as many Jewish people did- at the merciless hands of the nazis.  This movie will move you and cause you to examine your own spiritual journey.",N/A
751382,"I first saw this film with my father in the movies when I was twelve years old.  I watched it again yesterday and it still holds up.  It is a brilliant suspense film.Directed by Blake Edwards who also gave us Breakfast at Tiffanys and The Pink Panther films, this film concerns a bank teller terrorized by a bank robber/killer into stealing $100,000.00 from the bank she works for.  The teller is played by Lee Remick, one of the most charismatic and loveliest actresses of the '50s, '60s and '70s.  She is absolutely terrific.  She goes to the FBI and her case is handled by the utterly professional Glenn Ford, an actor that has never been given enough credit and I don't think has even given a bad performance.(I'd like to think that all FBI agents are as good as Ford's John Ripley.)  A very young Stefanie Powers plays Remick's high schooler sister.  The villain is chillingly played by the great Ross Martin (3 years before achieving fame as Artemus Gordon on The Wild Wild West tv series.  Martin must have been a favorite of Edwards since he previously co-starred in Edwards' very enjoyable Mr. Lucky tv series.)s  Edwards later used Martin again in his epic comedy The Great Race.  For some reason, Edwards does not give Martin billing at all in the opening credits and gives him the sole credit at the film's conclusion.The film is made on location in San Francisco and much of the film takes place at night.  The fact that it is made in black and white gives it a very film noir feeling.  The music is by Edwards' favorite film composer, Henry Mancini.  His gloomy theme music is one of my favorite movie themes.The very suspenseful conclusion takes place at Candlestick Park during a game between the Dodgers and Giants.  Real players like Don Drysdale are featured.As stated, this became one of my favorite suspense pictures from the first time I saw it.  It still holds up beautifully today.  Highly recommended.",N/A

More than 10 sci fi films were released, all with great potential to be be top-notch.To be 100% honest, I didn't have high hopes for Oblivion if only because the other films looked so strong by comparison. Oblivion exceeded my expectations and then some.I won't go into the storyline as many other reviewers already have. I will say that yes, certain elements are derivitive. There are parts of Independence Day, The Matrix and other (rather good btw) sci fi stories in the plot of Oblivion. However, at no point did I feel that any other film was being ""ripped-off"". Oblivion has enough of it's own original ideas and variation of classic themes to make it stand on it's own. New and old ideas both come together and make a rather satisfying film.Tom Cruise is solid here as is Morgan Freeman (is he ever in a bad movie?). The rest of the cast - especially Andrea Riseborough - are both believable and relatable. I especially enjoyed Melissa Leo as ""Sally"". Definitely an interesting take on the character she portrays.Lastly, both the special effects and score were great - both added quite a lot to the film.I've watched it numerous times and highly recommend it.",N/A

The film takes viewers on an unprecedented journey and offers a rare, never-before seen glimpse inside the world of the United States Military&#8217;s renowned K-9 teams: from the grueling handler selection process, to a relentless training regimen at Lackland Air Force in San Antonio, where handlers and their dogs begin to build a rock solid foundation that will lead to an indescribable bond that will save lives in combat, to Pre-Deployment training at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona.  These brave defenders of Freedom will be ready to meet any challenge that fate throws at them on the battlefield.This documentary also showcases personal interviews with the handlers themselves, who offer in-depth first-hand accounts of their experiences serving in Iraq and Afghanistan with their canine partners in arms.  Among them, is Marine Corps Military Working Dog handler Mike Dowling who is the author of the book &#8220;Sergeant Rex&#8221;, which chronicles his real-life experience during the Iraq conflict in 2004.  Interviews and footage from the frontlines puts you right in the middle of the action.  You can&#8217;t help but have a heightened appreciation for these valiant handlers and their noble dogs that have both endured and sacrificed more than anyone can begin to imagine on the field of battle.  &#8220;Always Faithful&#8221; delivers an unbiased approach examining the lives of America&#8217;s silent heroes.  However, unlike its predecessor &#8220;War Dogs of the Pacific&#8221; this is certainly a much more thorough and personal portrait of what it truly means to work with Military Working Dogs.

1246641,"'New York, I Love You' is a collection of ten short films on various interpretations/themes of love, all set in the one city in this country that every human being should at least visit before leaving this planet (I can't even put, into words, my love for New York City).  The short films are all VERY loosely (barely) tied together, and feature the strength of some very good actors like Bradley Cooper, Natalie Portman, Orlando Bloom, Christina Ricci, Olivia Thirlby, Anton Yelchin, James Caan, Hayden Christensen, Ethan Hawke, Andy Garcia, Julie Christie, Shia LaBeouf, John Hurt, Cloris Leachman, Robin Wright, Rachel Bilson, Chris Cooper and more.  The films themselves range from just okay to poignant ... but when they're good they are VERY good, particularly in the case of the Christie/Hurt/LaBeouf short, which weeks later still sticks with me emotionally (this one short film contains probably the sweetest, most touching and real performance of LaBeouf's career, so far).  Quirky, sometimes funny, sometimes a bit odd, altogether the films did leave me with the same sense of left-of-center beauty New York itself has always given me - and even though ten films in 103 minutes doesn't leave a lot of room for character or plot development, for this sense of NYC alone (along with the small bunch of shorts here that really stand out from the crowd) 'New York, I Love You' is time well spent for anyone who loves the city ... or finds it fascinating, just the same.","New York, I Love You"

The previews looked good.  But she seemed honestly too old for the role, not a young girl, a novice nun.  Her deeper voice reinforced that.The actress who played the Baroness sang well, but her character was disconcertingly nice (so politically correct) rather than going for the evil step-mother role.  And what was that nonsense about her being a &#34;corporation president&#34;?  She was a Baroness in the 1930's not a 2013 career woman. Can't they produce a story true to the times it was set in without feeling the need to revise it to the point of politically correct inanity? The story loses much of its historical punch and sense of the times it was set in when the writers do this inane rewriting.Stephen Moyer could not sing; his acting seemed forced at times.  And the expressions on his face were more constipated than stern.  His stuttering and panic when the Admiral showed up with his commission was lame.  I was sadly disappointed in him.Obviously a live TV production is not a movie production, but even for a TV production it was a jangling anachronistic mess.  I was looking forward to a new &#34;stage&#34; production of this classic based on a historical cusp  but then the production dumbed down the history.  Some of the costumes and hairstyles were jarringly not period.  And given this was supposed to be a story about the von Trapp family fleeing the Nazis, I found it grating and ironic that the script had to be so politically correct they refused to even say the name Hitler, in the Heil Hitler salute. To hear them repeatedly  saying just  &#34;Heil!&#34; and having the Captain snapping about people saying Heil  to him and how it offended him (without the Hitler) was just utter ludicrousness.And while she could certainly sing, the casting of the Mother Abbess was another jarring non period note.  Her voice in dialogue was often without inflection too, as if she was reading a teleprompter rather than feeling the lines.I thought the young actor who played Kurt was good, and the actress who played Liesel.  Also, the Dettweiler character.But most of this production, sadly, was just weighed down by bad acting, bad singing, inconsistent production values, and changing what was meant to be a historical story to a 2013 political correctness.But I'm going to be watching my DVD of the original Sound of Music to remove the jangling discordancies of this one from my mind.",The Sound of Music Live!

297140,"Private detective Phillip Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) decides to try his hand at writing, in order to supplement the living he ekes out as a shamus, so he pens a story he calls If I Should Die Before I Live. He submits it to a publisher, Kingsby Publishing, and receives a letter from an A. Fromsett, requesting his presence. When he duly presents himself, he discovers that A stands for Adrienne (Audrey Totter) and the lady has something else on her mind besides his story.It sees that Ms. Fromsett is more interested in Marlowe's detective skills than in his ability to wield the literary pen. It seems that her boss, Derace Kingsley (Leon Ames) has a wife that has been missing for a month. A telegram received from El Paso claims that she's run off to get a Mexican divorce and intends to marry Chris Lavery. Fromsett says she wants to find Chrystal Kingsby for her boss's sake, but Marlowe quickly figures out she has her own agenda.She sweetens the pot by adding $300 to the $200 she was going to pay for his story, the additional monies to cover his fees for his services. Kingsby learns of her interfering and lets her know in no uncertain terms that his wife is free to do as she wishes, and that he has no romantic interest in Fromsett.Taking the case, Marlowe goes to Bay City and visits Lavery (Dick Simmons), a southern boy with a smooth way of talking and a way with the ladies. He doesn't take kindly to Marlowe's questions and clocks him. Being a stubborn sort of guy, Marlowe continues to follow the trail and ends up on the wrong side of the Bay City police, especially one Detective Degarmot (Lloyd Nolan).In trying to figure out who's who and what's what, Marlowe has to contend with unfriendly police, a dead lady in a lake, a corpse, a landlady, being set up and jailed, and fighting off feelings for Adrienne. Makes him wonder if perhaps writing isn't a safer career.First, I have to say if you've read the book and enjoyed it, just pretend you haven't or you might be confused and/or dismayed at the film translation. Yes, the basic facts are there, more or less. But there are some significant, as well as minor changes. I understand the constraints of film, but if I hadn't read the book, I think I wouldn't have had a full appreciation for the film. Which isn't to say you have to read the book to enjoy the movie, but it helps.Second, the film employs a technique that was new in its day and I don't believe ever really caught on, although if you watch the film trailer in the extras on the DVD, you'll see it was touted at the time as quite the breakthrough. The camera shows the film from the perspective of Phillip Marlowe, a subjective view. You and Marlowe together view everything. What he sees, you see. When he gets knocked out, your world goes dark too. I guess in theory it sounded better than it was. Or perhaps the director didn't utilize the technique very well. Ironically, Robert Montgomery directed as well as starred in this. But it didn't work for me, and I actually found it annoying, and felt it slowed down the action. I can see why it didn't catch on.Montgomery is the third actor I've seen portray Marlowe, the first two being Bogart and Dick Powell. I rank him third in my list of who did the best job, with Powell at the top. That doesn't make him bad, just not great. Besides, he doesn't spend as much time onscreen, because of the filming technique. Maybe that's a good thing.There are minor changes with names and spelling. In the book, there is no Kingsby Publishing Company, and Marlowe deals with Mr. Kingsley, rather than his subordinate, A. Fromsett.  You may remember the actor who plays Kingsby as the father in Meet Me in St. Louis. Jayne Meadows appears as Mildred Haveland; she was married for many years to comedian Steve Allen. Lloyd Nolan plays the prickly Lieutenant Degarmot. He's done many things over the years. I think of him first as the kindly doctor in the TV series Julia.On the whole, I enjoyed the film, but I think it could be done better. They really missed the boat in not even going up to the lake where the lady in the title is discovered, and we don't meet Bill Chess at all. Those could have been interesting scenes, especially the discovery of the body. Plus it's in the title--Lady in the Lake--but we never see the lake. I think the book could have been adapted better. But, taken as it is, it's a solid watch, although flawed, and if you enjoy Marlowe and want to experience it all, book and film, then it's worthwhile watching.",N/A

Skillfully, with gorgeous animation, colourful characters, and impeccable voice work, the movie tells the untold story of our favourite feline bandito - the one and only Puss...in Boots! Set in sandy deserts, dust-swept towns, and with a distinctive Fistful of Dollars feel, Puss in Boots accomplishes something impressive indeed; being a smart film, entertaining for both kids and adults, with an emotional core that satisfies younger audiences and critics, I call Puss in Boots a success!This is in no small part to the fantastic, detailed, atmospheric, rich world that our characters live in. Thanks no doubt in part to executive producerGuillermo del Toro'spracticed eye for atmosphere, lush detail, and stunning cinematography. Watching the movie, one is reminded of Sergio Leone's Man With No Name Trilogy, with several clever nods to famous spaghetti westerns present, and the old Zorro TV shows, including Antonio Banderas' fantasticThe Mask Of Zorro.But visually is not the only area Puss in Boots succeeds. The voicework is incredibly good.Zach Galifianakisis excellent as the shifty Humpty (Alexander) Dumpty., andSalma Hayekis also impeccable as Kitty Soft-Paws, a literal cat burglar. While the rest of the cast is beyond criticism, the real star (once again) here isAntonio Banderas, whose silky-smooth, charismatic voice lends great gravitas and charm to the adventure-seeking, boot-wearing, milk-lapping, sword-wielding, fast-talking eponymous Puss in Boots.The story is nothing new or groundbreaking, nor is the movie especially weighty or dramatic, but for kids, and even for adults savvy enough to catch the references, Puss in Boots is an entertaining, action-packed, funny, witty, gorgeously animated adventure! My rating? 4 magic beans out of five.P.S. We! WANT! a sequel...We! WANT! a sequel... We! WA--",Puss in Boots

849170,"I have been getting a lot of prenatal workout videos from Netflix to find out which ones I like best before investing.  I really started doing these around 32 weeks of my pregnancy (I'm now 35) so I am a little less mobile and a little lazier than I was in the first 2 trimesters.  I really like this prenatal yoga video for a few reasons:PROS:-2 options, one is energizing and about 30 mins the other is relaxing and about 15-20 mins.  You can do them both together and they make a nice 45 minute practice.-The teacher isn't annoying.  She explains things well and she has 2 helpers - one is a beginner and in her first trimester and the other is a bad-ass yogi and in her 3rd trimester (like 39 weeks or something.)  I like watching the full term lady go crazy with the yoga.-The poses feel good and aren't too difficult but can be modified.  I have been practicing yoga for 10 years or so on and off but have fallen out of it during pregnancy and I am just starting again towards the end of my pregnancy in abject fear of the actual labor process.  The poses mostly just feel really good and are good for most levels.CONS:-This isn't a hardcore workout.  I think it's best in your late 2nd or 3rd trimesters for stretching and relaxing or just to take it easy towards the beginning.-That't about the only downside.Overall, this is a great little DVD to have in your repertoire of prenatal DVDs.  Especially if you want to do something but take it easy at the same time.",N/A

309983,"'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is a great movie with a great cast. Diana Riggs had just rocketed to fame as Emma Peel on television's 'the Avengers'. Here in OHMSS she looks absolutely beautiful and also very hot. Also in the film is actor Telly Savalas (who would later conquer the broadcast airwaves in the 70's with the Emmy-award-winning detective series called 'Kojak'). I still think Savalas was the best Bloefeld out of all the early Bond films -- he was mentally and physically tough  for Bond.I thought George Lazenby was an excellent James Bond (critics be damned). I thought it was just unfortunate he had to come after Sean Connery. People today are now recognizing his importance and contribution to the Bond franchise, at least I hope they understand now (witness the Daniel Craig James Bond character -- without Lazenby and Peter Hunt the producers would still probably be looking for more Roger Moore Bonds. Hah, hah).Btw, director Peter Hunt was a master in film editing before he took the job of directing his first and (unfortunately) his last James Bond film. His previous jobs of course were editor for Doctor No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and Thunderball -- the early great Bond films.The incredible ski chase shot in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' were the first ever for the Bond series. Of course it has been copied and imitated, but I still think the original in OHMSS is the most dramatic, exciting, and breathtaking than the copies that followed.The music for OHMSS is composer John Barry's finest, with songs like the enchanting ""Do you Know How Christmas Trees Are Grown,"" and Lous Armstrong's sweet ""We Have All the Time In the World"". You also have the great ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" main title theme, and the exciting ""Battle of Piz Gloria"" theme also among other memorable Barry music.I put 'On Her Majesty's Secret service' in my top five favorite James Bond movies.

501479,"Personally I think that this set should have had Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.  It would have worked better as the three Hopkins movies, both in terms of flow since Red Dragon ends where Silence of the Lambs picks up, and since Hopkins made the role iconic, having his three films in one set would make more sense.As it is, this has the 1986 film Manhunter, which was the original adaptation of Red Dragon on film with Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter.  I know there are those who love that version more than the Hopkins/Edward Norton version, but I am not one of them.  I think Manhunter missed having the actual capture of Lecter which is shown in Red Dragon, and as a result Lecter is left to even more of a cameo role than he was in the remake.  Secondly, the ""Mr D"" character which is developed very well in Red dragon is barely done in Manhunter.  We actually do not even see him until he kidnaps the reporter and get almost none of his interaction with the blind co-worker so their relationship seems very forced.Silence of the Lambs is of course the Jewel of the collection.  Even 20 years out it still stands up as a great film, and the transfer to blu ray was done about as well as you would expect for a film that old with little to no special effects.  That is the only movie that has any special features.  It has an annotated version of the film where some of the actors would have comments pop up, as well as sidebars throughout.  There are also several behind the scenes features, deleted and extended scenes and a gag reel.Hannibal, while an okay sequel I think did lack some from losing Jodie Foster.  Although I thought Julianne Moore did a good job with the role of Clarice, it would have benefited from having all the original characters.  Otherwise I though the story was good, if even unbelievable.  Since Hannibal Lecter was supposedly the world's most notorious serial killer, the fact that he was living so openly seems far fetched at best.  But if you can accept that, the rest of the movie is fine.  Hopkins slipped easily back into the role of Lecter, and while the material he had to work with was not as good as in Silence, he still did a great job with the role.  My only disappointment with that disc is there were no extras whatsoever save a few trailers for other movies.All in all, if you like the books, or just the character of Lecter this is definitely worth getting.

Overall, the movie itself stays faithful to Tolkien's original manuscript, with a few problems here and there (story-wise, the absence of Tom Bombadil; in terms of the audio mix - well, I think the other reviews I've read for this DVD speak for themselves, so the sooner Warner Bros. releases a new version with a better sound mix, truer to the original TV broadcast in other words, the better).",N/A
1105762,"An amazing (and only) opera commissioned for TV, in 1952 it became a Christmas tradition until the mid-sixties when the culture in general and T.V. in particular moved the center of Christmas from Christ to Claus. However, this opera deserves a listen at any time of the year.  This DVD is of a live performance from the 1955 broadcast. The video is a kinescope (i.e. film of the broadcast monitor) and primitive by today's standards, but the music and performances transcends the technology.  The audio is quite good, though.",N/A

1578903,"Jack Benny is my favorite comedian, with George Burns a close second.  Both are present on these Jack Benny programs along with Benny regulars Don Wilson, Dennis Day, Frank Wilson, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, Mel Blanc, and one episode with Mary Livingstone.  Special guests featured included John Wayne, Spike Jones, Milton Berle, Gary Cooper, Rock Hudson, Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood, Billy Graham, Harry Truman, and many more.  However, some of the shows - especially the Gary Cooper and Harry Truman were of extremely poor quality which was a big disappointment.  I don't think any restoration was done on these episodes which were from kinescopes.  Some of the later episodes look better but it is a shame that they all did not have the same restoration efforts on all episodes.  The bonus features ranged from a very interesting interview with some of those who worked with Benny to some disappointing color episodes where Benny goes to introduce Frank Sinatra or Dinah Shore singing a song but you never get to hear the song!  The worse was so called Hearst Newsreel that I had thought from the title would be actual newsreel footage but seemed more like rehearsal since the same lines were said over and over again.  I always think Benny is funnier on radio where your imagination takes over.  I rate this a five as anything with Benny is always good and seeing some of this footage that I have never seen before was exciting but I rate it as a one for the quality of the non-existent ""restorations"" and the disappointing bonus features so it ends up a three.  I think a better job could have been done on this set.",The Jack Benny Program: The Lost Episodes

510764,"This was a beautiful, subtle movie that fills you with just as much hope as it does tragedy.  You're drawn into the dreamlike quality of the scenery and music, it's like a gorgeous sleep that comes over you.  And yet, you go in fully knowing that it's a tragedy which is about to happen or has already happened.Jeremy Irons plays Humbert Humbert, a man with a penchant for young girls that he just cannot get past.  He moves into a house as a boarder with Charlotte, a grown up version of her daughter, Lolita.  While Charlotte has a thing for Humbert, he stays because he is in love with her daughter, Lolita.  Lolita is the nymphet, the deadly demon, who loves to provoke and tease to her heart's content.  A series of tragic accidents and purposeful things occur, and then Humbert is at last alone with Lolita.  The two of them embark on a journey which is as much as a cross country adventure as it is an exploration of what is or isn't happening between them.  It's oddly hard to keep in mind that Humbert is the villain in this saga, that he is the monster that we warn kids about who is seemingly innocent and hard working and yet we are silently hoping for him at the same time.  Lolita is as much a plaything as she is a demon, who knows she can use what she has in a power trip over Humbert to get the things that she wants and uses it quite a bit.  How it ends?  Won't give that away, but we know based on this horrible, tragic event that it's doomed.It's rather slow moving and yet you wouldn't want it any other way.  Perhaps it's all about wanting to be innocent and happy again with someone or something that you want to be just so innocent and happy with.",N/A

The reason I always liked this series was the fact that it was very well written and give you a better insight into the character of Tony Stark and will his alter ego Iron Man. I love the and the mix of interaction with villains, while at the same time to get an insight into his ability to run Stark Enterprises. This is another great season and though not all of the season 2 episodes are on one DVD, this collection was again another strong asset to the series as a whole.

It is usually someone being portrayed as a narcissist/self-centered/junkie/drunk ""artist"".In a shallow view, ""Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life"" can be one more of these movies. Certainly the ""A Heroic Life"" helps. What is so ""heroic"" about his life? That he nailed BB, Jane Birkin among others? Maybe. That's something beyond reach of any mere mortal. He was a great poet and musician and produced amazing works of art. I am not sure if that is enough to qualify someone as ""heroic"".The big difference between this movie and others from the genre is the approach of that inner Dionysian voice that is inside us all. Some of us totally ignore this voice, some dispute her balancing with other voices that are also inside us that control our reason and some of us obey that voice blindly.

He didn't need her because he just didn't need her or because he became the voice?I found this an amazing movie. Well made, amazing acting and so on. And, yes.

1529089,"CLEANSKIN stars Sean Bean as an anti-terrorism expert. The film chronicles the evolution of a British-born Muslim law student in London (""Ash"" played by Abhin Galeya) into a suicide bomber. It's filled with action, and it has you on the edge of your seat for a full two hours. It's by far the best commercial film I've seen on ""homegrown"" terrorist recruitment, practically a video handbook:1. Recruiters for terror cells are like recruiters for any other cult---They seek out isolated, disaffected young people:Ash is bright and handsome but feels alienated from his fellow law students, some of whom call him derogatory names. His recruitment starts with a bar fight over a girl.2. The terror recruiters, rather than building up their recruits' sense of self-worth, break it down:""You see?"" says the recruiter, an Imam, ""They call you a ""n****r""; they call you a ""Paki"", you will never be like them. You have been hated all your life. Look what they've done to you! You're weak! You can't make your own choices! Only a coward wants to be like his oppressor, and you are oppressed, and you are a coward!""3. Then the recruiter extols membership in the cult:""You are a member of an ancient civilization. An honorable civilization. You are not like them, with their decadent drinking, their music, their shameless women. You don't want to be like them...They are drunkards, they eat swine, they defile the sanctity of their bodies and their souls! There is not one decent one among them. They are not like us, they are worthless, they have no values, and they have no value even to themselves. If you are with us, you will have given up all that self-abuse. Be a man!""4. The recruiter then globalizes the issue:""And it is not just you. It is your brothers everywhere. In Chechnya. In Kosovo. In Palestine. In Iraq. In Afghanistan. They not only want to spread their decadence to you, here, but they want to spread their decadence all over this earth!""5. The pitch:""It is up to you to stop them!""After Ash accompanies a more experienced terrorist on a local ""mission"" that ends in the decapitation of a husband, wife, and infant, the decision is made to send Ash overseas ""for more and better training."" He comes back a bombmaker. And even at that point, he moves among the population of London innocuously, he dates non-Muslim women, and nobody sees what's uncoiling inside him. At a half-dozen points he almost takes off his dynamite vest, but in the end, his own inadequacies, aided and abetted by his recruiters' constant exhortations, consume his entire life.What's hopeful is that not everyone the recruiters approach falls for their ""You're a Victim!"" routine. What's less hopeful is that because the recruiters move among (and claim to be) members of a legitimate religious community, even the people who send the recruiters away tend to do nothing and say nothing to undermine what is obviously occurring.I had never heard of CLEANSKIN (the title comes from the fact that Ash is an unknown terrorist without a history; he has ""clean skin""). I watched this, purely by chance, at a friend's house in the wake of the Boston bombing.  Idiots like the Tsarnaev brothers couldn't exist if there wasn't a conspiracy of silence in Islam. But we don't hear Imams coming out publicly decrying the violence and the loss of life in Boston and elsewhere. Muslims who do decry the violence are silenced or ignored, expelled from their communities, like Irshad Manji, or worse, like Salman Rushdie, given death sentences.The fact is, these terrorists make up a cult, but it's a cult given legitimacy by its association with a legitimate religious structure. And it's a cult that few Muslims choose to challenge for fear of social ostracism or, worse, targeting by the cult.But at least I understand the Tsarnaev brothers now. Their uncle was right.

It is a movie that has taken the basic premise of that movie, artificial memory implantation, and then constructed a very different story around it from what the original movie had.

1572351,"Im always a little wary about these Hollywood films being toted and talked about by critics as though it were the coming of the Lord. So I wasn't disappointed by this film because I had low expectations to begin with. Bradly Cooper is one of my favorite actors. I loved his last film, the one that is like a splice between Total Recall and Inception. Jennifer Lawrence, however, I am not crazy about. I didn't find her role in Winter's Bone to be all THAT. It was an ok film. Not shocking, enthralling or mesmorizing at all to me. Obvious, however, yes. She was good in the Hunger Games, but I think its true what they say, &#34;You're only as good as the actor in front of you.&#34; And she had a lot of actors in front of her that day. I know, you could say the same about her role up against Bradly, and you may be right. Sometimes he isn't that great either. But this isn't one of those times.In this role Cooper is just being released from a mental hospital after the nervous breakdown he suffered due to the discovery of his wife's infidelity with one of Cooper's co-workers. On the day of his release, Cooper decides he is going to get his wife back and make things right again by being positive, truthful and compassionate to the needs of others, as he was none of these things in his marriage before the breakdown. He meets Lawrence's character at the dinner party of a longtime friend, whose wife decides to tempt fate by trying to set up her sister (Lawrence) whom is grieving the loss of her husband with Cooper. The dinner is a disaster, both Lawrence and Cooper spend the evening discussing which medications they have been taking. An awkward moment arrives and Cooper has to excuse himself. Lawrence follows in pursuit, hits on Cooper, is denied, slaps him and then exits. It was funny but I also felt their tension, confusion and awkwardness. I have had moments like this. I am bipolar and recently experienced something similar at a dinner party. I hate dinner parties. I hate parties.The problem with this movie is that I thought that was the best part of it. After that, it just tries too hard. Cooper, I thought did a good job though in conveying the hardships of an mental illness when involving relationships. The scene in the attic bedroom when he comes unhinged and the cops are called was meant to be funny Im sure, but to me, it was real. And it was frightening. I've been there. So props to Cooper for a job well done.",Silver Linings Playbook

293120,"I saw this warped little gem at a bar in Yonkers, NY back in the early 1990's. I can tell you 3 things that happened during its run that night:1) Not a single person left until it was over2) Every person there was scared sober by the time it was over3) Every person there needed a drink after it was overThe movie has a deceptively simple setup: a group of young adults decides to crash a 'cabin-in-the-woods' one of them knows about. They believe the owners almost never come there, making it perfect for a weekend of uninterrupted debauchery.However, they find a book, and tape recorder in the abandoned cabin...The book is the notorious and legendary 'Necromicon', the invention and lynchpin of H.P. Lovecraft's mad cosmos of horror. The tape recording is of the owner...a scientist who was studying the book, with lethal results.It seems that the hapless scientist read a portion of the book, which allowed evil spirits to invade cadavers...who came by to make a midnight snack of the good doc. Our young protagonists stupidly play the doc's recording of him reading the passage...and, the spirit/zombies come for them.While this may sound like the 'same-old, same-old', it rises above it all because of two unique talents:1) Director Sam Raimi, whose love of horror, breathtakingly kinetic camera work and penchant for black humor mine consistent laughs out of the most dire of situations2) The great character-actor Bruce Campbell, whose comic-book-hero visage/physique make him believable as the guy who can fight off these evil spirits (even with a chain saw grafted onto the stump of his wrist; and, whose natural goofiness make him the perfect vessel to channel Raimi's insane black humor (&#34;...shop smart...shop S-Mart!&#34;).Bottom line: often imitated, never equaled...this movie is frightening, gory (to the point of deliberate excess) imaginative, blackly funny and flat-out unforgettable.

Or did the Luftwaffe have only two left by May of 1943?I kept waiting to see scenes of what the bombs were doing when they hit the ground-- killing thousands real people down there-- mostly children and women. Of course it is difficult to hit a target from 10,000 feet. Those bombs aimed at that factory were just as likely to land next door on the school or the hospital. (One problem the German intelligence had with the British bombing, and the Brits bombed more than we did, was figuring out what the target city was-- not which part of the city was the target-- but which city was the target.) And of course many civilians were living in the factories, since we had already bombed them out of their homes. But maybe if we kill the civilians, they will just give up and call it quits.Cute film; ""our"" men were brave, but do read the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, 1946, which stated that German industrial production increased greatly during the bombing.",N/A

1551102,While I've never actually played any of the Persona games it's hardly necessary to enjoy the anime series as the character and storyline are more then enough to keep you entertained throughout the series. The basic story is you have a young highschool student Yu Narukami going to small Japanese town to stay with his uncle for awhile when a strange string of murders start to happen for no apparent reason as Yu investigates the weird situation he finds out that it's due to a weird connection to something called the Midnight Channel and as he continues he meets friends and comrades who help each other try and stop the murders and solve the mystery of the Midnight Channel.  The animation is decent but not the usual kind seen with the more known series like Gundam or Naruto it's more a mix of Last Exile and Glass Fleet not the exact animation but a close enough approximation. The one weird thing about the sets is that if you want both the subbed and dubbed audio tracks you have to get the regular dvd sets not the blu-ray ones which seems a little strange as if you get the blu-ray version you will only have the dubbed audio track and not the subbed audio like on the standard regular set.I'd advise checking out a few episodes online if possible but after watching a few episodes I'm sure you enjoy this series more then enough to get the entire set for your anime collection to enjoy whenever you wish.,N/A

1645281,"First Off, since WrestleMania 28, the WWE has hit 5 star PPV's all along with awesome never before seen matches, rematches waiting to happen, and superstar returns that should have happened years ago and then you get Payback, Payback my ass.  All this PPV offered was another boring episode of Raw or Smackdown.  Every match was boring, scripted, and predictable.  Now that is out of the way, lets talk about the 3 stages of hell match.  First up was WWE trying to 1 up ECW on their Extreme rules PPV this year, because if they were they made a foul of themselves.  I mean since when did the WWE have their last Ambulance match, let alone a 3 stages of hell match.  1 stage a lumberjack match, In a 3 stages of hell match c-mon I could have made a better first stage than this.  1 fall goes to Rhyback. 2 stage A tables match.  The match was to short, predictable, and the tables were fake. 2 fall goes to Cena.  3 fall the Ambulance match.  FAKE AND SCRIPTED, FAKE AND SCRIPTED.  The fact that the entire door of the ambulance came off and easy might I add and was used as a weapon, also the trap door on top of the ambulance that rhyback goes through that lets cena win the match which was shown clear as day I give props to WWE for covering that secret up, looked so real, not, it was simply laughable and as predicted guess who won the match 3 fall of course goes to Cena.  Anyone who gave this PPV more than 1 star are the wrestling fans I truly hate, absolutely no respect for the superstars, or the ,legacy of the wwe.  Leave this PPV for the kids.  Being a life long WWE fan and watching magic on other current WWE PPV's all I can say is what a disappointment.",WWE: Payback

504736,"Pedro Almodovar is one of those directors who has such a vivid sense of self in all of his features, and a rabid fan base that appreciates everything he touches.  I am becoming more and more acquainted with his work with each passing year, and while I stand on the fence with his collective body of work, there is no denying that he can weave a crazy tale like no one else.  His soap opera tendencies serve to either aid or hinder his films, depending on the narrative and his use of restraint, but at the end of the day when he gets it right he gets it VERY right.`Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' is a moment when he got it very right.Thrusting us into the lives of multiple women, all contending with various issues regarding men, Almodovar paints a colorful and flourishing picture of bickering, pleading, plotting and reminiscing all with surging splashing of charm, wit and loads of soap!Pepa is an actress in love with a married man.  That married man has been separated from his wife for some time, and now he is walking out on Pepa.  When he leaves for holiday, Pepa assumes he has gone back to his wife, while his wife is certain that he is taking Pepa.  There is a third woman involved, yet neither is aware of her.  Then Pepa is introduced to her lover's son and his fianc&eacute; when they come by coincidentally to buy her place.  When Pepa's best friend shows up with her own set of man problems (this time involving the cops), Pepa's place is turned into a circus complete with drugged gazpacho and loaded guns.Almodovar doesn't hold back here, but the film really called for such lavish helpings of `over the top'.  It benefits from an outlandish atmosphere because the narrative is just that farfetched.  It thrives.  The cast is uniformly great, with Carmen Maura and Julieta Serrano taking `best in show' notices from me.If you are new to the world of Almodovar, then check this one out.  It pretty much highlights the zone he is in for most of his films and gives you a taste of him at the tip top of his game.",N/A

419484,"Thanks to some bizarre copyright issues, the rights to the James Bond novel Thunderball were never completely held by the traditional Bond production team.Thus, another movie or movies could be made by another company with a screenplay based on Thunderball. Never Say Never Again was the result in 1983, with Sean Connery returning as James Bond 11 years after he had last played the role in Diamonds are Forever.Roger Moore's tenure as Bond was winding down in 1983, though that year's official Bond entry, Octopussy, still outgrossed this movie. Connery looks game but a little tired here, and the pacing seems off, and the movie overlong by about 20 minutes and one too many changes of locale. Klaus Maria Brandauer does make for a surprisingly sinister Bond villain, while Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger do OK work as Bond girls evil and good, respectively.The tone shifts even more abruptly than usual for a Bond film, from parodic to serious and back again. That may partially be because of the screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple, who helped turn both the Batman tv series of the 1960's and the 1980 Flash Gordon film into smirking parodies of themselves. It's not quite Camp here, but it's close. M and the rest of the Bond hierarchy take the most severe beating, though Rowan Atkinson's first big-screen appearance, as an MI6 operative played solely for laughs, also grates. Bernie Casey is fine as CIA agent Felix Leiter, and actually has something to do other than supply exposition.The prime oddity of Never Say Never Again is that the first thirty minutes or so play like a dry run for the recent Bond movie Skyfall, as a rundown James Bond faces suspension and the Double-O program itself faces termination in the wake of political changes. An historical oddity, Never Say Never Again also acts as a weird psychological test -- viewing a James Bond movie without the familiar soundtrack never feels entirely comfortable. That the score for this movie, and the title song, are both unremittingly terrible doesn't help things.",Never Say Never Again VHS

1346784,"Mario Monicelli's Casanova `70 was the kind of risqu&eacute; globe-trotting Italian sex comedy that found favour in the US at a time when the local censors seemed to allow foreign films more leeway than American ones but which now, despite its unapologetically smutty premise and some brief nudity, seems much more innocent and charming. Marcello Mastroianni is a NATO officer who finds that the sexual liberation of the 60s is sapping his libido to the point of impotence: with women not just easy prey but practically throwing themselves at men (provided you meet the minimum requirements, of course), the thrill of conquest leaves him unable to make love unless there's an element of danger to spice things up. His efforts to control his sexual demons are constantly doomed to failure, thanks to a succession of female lion tamers, jinxed prostitutes with a reputation for killing their clients and rich wives with homicidally jealous husbands until he finds himself in the dock with his various conquests (Virna Lisi, Michele Mercier and Marissa Mell among them) called as character witnesses...It's very much of its time - despite the title, it was made in 1965 - and it's hard to understand quite how it got a Best Screenplay Oscar nomination that year, but after a rather sluggish opening that's short of real laughs it does develop into something much funnier, and not just in the scenes with his female co-stars: two of the funniest scenes involve a cottage industry faking antiques and selling them by the pound like steak and cuckolded husband Marco Ferreri's attempt to get rid of his new rival. It's the kind of glamorous fluff that's increasingly enjoyable if you're in the right mood, with Mastroianni on particularly good form, and Kino's Region-free US Blu-ray offers a decent but not outstanding widescreen transfer (there's some slight digital noise in places, but nothing too distracting) in the original Italian with English subtitles. Extras are limited to the original Italian trailer, stills gallery and trailer for Kino's other Mastroianni and Sophia Loren titles.",N/A

With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr&eacute;), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor.  Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character.  Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support.  Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests.  His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause.  History proved the opposite: as this film reveals, he obtained only pyrrhic victories against the Turks.",N/A

1607367,"History's enduring fascination with the gruesome crimes of Jack The Ripper continues unabated with yet another example of popular fiction being inspired by the legendary murderer. Truthfully, I have read enough books, seen enough television, and watched enough movies that cast Jack The Ripper into a central role that I feel like he's an old friend--albeit one I wouldn't want to invite home to dinner. So wearily and warily, I sat down to watch the BBC production of ""Ripper Street."" I watch a LOT on BBC, perhaps too much! Having recently watched both ""Whitechapel"" (a Jack tale set in present day) and ""Copper"" (a historical crime drama), I couldn't help seeing ""Ripper Street"" as somewhat of a stylistic cross between both of these shows. ""Ripper Street"" is set in London's East End circa 1889 in the ensuing chaos following the notorious murders. The show centers around a precinct called H Division. Six months after Jack's spree, they are still entrusted to keep the peace within the Whitechapel neighborhood where fear and hysteria run rampant. Although Jack's carnage may be a thing of the past (or is it?), his legacy endures and the streets are far from safe!As more murders start to be discovered, the public paranoia immediately points to Jack's return. It's up to H Division to sort these crimes out and apprehend the real culprits. To be fair, it might not be entirely accurate to call this a show about Jack the Ripper. The atmosphere and setting of the show is historically linked and influenced by these murders, but the plotting stays the course of a more conventional police procedural with different crimes to solve episodically. The always reliable Matthew Macfadyen heads the investigative team with the assistance of Jerome Flynn and Adam Rothenberg. I like Macfadyen's intensity, as usual, and Rothenberg gets more of the personal drama as his relationship with a brothel madam (Myanna Buring) is one of the series' more intriguing side plots. Rounding out the principle cast are a scandal seeking reporter (David Dawson) and a mother haunted by her daughter's death (Amanda Hale). The performances throughout are solidAs I said, the principle plot threads of ""Ripper Street"" have to do with solving new cases. MacFadyen and team are rather progressive, and part of the show's appeal is seeing the evolution of modern police investigative techniques. This can sometimes feel a little too modern as if the show wants to hedge its bets and attract the CSI crowd! Also to appeal to a wider audience, Rothenberg is both an American surgeon and a former Pinkerton. So he brings a different perspective that the other Detective Inspectors can learn from and clash with. But despite some of these conveniences in plotting, the show really does a good job highlighting the panic and fear that distinguishes the Whitechapel area.The staging of the program is impressively dark and dreary. A lot of money seems to have been spent getting the period details just so. A lot of the scenes are shot outside where the sets look spectacular. Sometimes, however, the filming techniques and discordant music feel a little heavy. Overall, though, I think ""Ripper Street"" is very well done from a technical standpoint. I'm afraid, however, that some people will come to the show looking for fast paced action or even something more gruesome. The show is earnest and methodical and it takes its time. Some episodes can feel spectacularly slow and I don't think that it's necessarily a home run right out of the gate. If you stick with it, ""Ripper Street"" finds its rhythm and improves with subsequent episodes as the screenplays can dig into the characters a bit deeper. If you like either crime procedurals or period piece dramas, this might be worth a look. KGHarris, 1/13.",N/A
1529423,"Every time some deranged individual goes on a mass killing spree, we rightly focus our attention and concern on the victims and the devastated loved ones they leave behind. But who thinks about the impact such events have on the family of the killer?  Well, the makers of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" certainly have, and the result is both heartbreaking and blood-curdling to witness.This grimly fascinating indie drama focuses on Eva (Tilda Swinton in a bravura performance), the mother of a troubled teen who slaughters a number of his fellow classmates in a high school assembly.  The multi-tiered screenplay by Rory Kinnear and director Lynne Ramsay looks at Eva's life both after the massacre and in the years leading up to it (Kevin is played  by three different actors  at various stages of life).From the beginning, Kevin is clearly a problem child, a ""bad seed"" as it were, for lack of a better term (think of Damian sans the supernatural powers and Satanic bloodline).  Perpetually frustrated and exhausted, filled with self-loathing and doubt, Eva spends every waking moment struggling to be a decent mother to her child, but nothing she does or says can break through the emotional barrier the sociopathic Kevin has set up between himself and the world.  Eva is further isolated by the fact that Kevin even has his own father (John C. Reilly) deluded into believing that the problem does indeed lie with Eva, in her weaknesses and inadequacies as a mother - almost to the point where even Eva, at some level, begins to believe it herself.Swinton breaks our hearts every step of the way as she wages a constant, solitary battle against a force she has no hope of ever understanding or controlling - for all the parents around her seem to have no such problems raising their own, much more reasonable and malleable children.  It leads us to the broader question of what happens when that most basic of all human bonds - that between a parent and a child - is irrevocably broken.  And how is a parent to love a child who steadfastly refuses to love her back?And life is certainly no better for Eva after the killings, for now she is forced to live out the rest of her life as a pariah in a community that blames her in large part for the tragic loss it has suffered, a community that has no interest in reaching out to her for understanding or healing. Her fate, then, is to struggle on alone, devoid of sympathy, compassion and any chance at reparation.""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" may be one of the bleakest and most despairing portraits of parenthood and childrearing ever committed to film, but it makes for a haunting and unnerving experience that you will find very hard to shake.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

412838,"This movie was an effort by John Carpenter to make a series of movies under the name Halloween without the Michael Myers character (aside from when Halloween was playing on TV in the background). It was a total flop, and hence the series of movies never developed and the studio went on to make multiple movies with Myers that ranged from pretty good, to incredibly stupid without Carpenter's involvement.I think this movie was doomed as soon as they tried to put the Halloween label on it. By then the Michael Myers character was synonymous with Halloween and anything that did not have him in it was never going to be given a shot. Personally I think Carpenter should have just promoted it under his name and not given it the Halloween title (something even the people involved admit). It probably would have done better and the series would have probably produced more than one film.As a movie I thought it was good, but not great. Given when it was made the writing and special effects were kind of cheesy, but it definitely has that creepy factor that any good horror movie has. The storyline was definitely weird and will not appeal to everyone. It was basically a company making haunted Halloween masks that when worn when a particular commercial came on would kill the person wearing it. It also had killer androids that would do the bad guy's dirty work. While there are certainly better horror movies out there, if you are a fan of the genre, and are ok with an offbeat out there kind of story line and the lack of Michael Myers you may want to check this out.",Halloween 3 - Season of the Witch VHS

1497965,"You would have thought that police series have been done from every conceivable angle over the years, and it is almost an achievement in itself to come up with one which is at all out of the ordinary. However, the script writers have managed to achieve just that with Death in Paradise which is quite an offbeat drama. The series is set on the fictional Caribbean island of Sainte-Marie, but was in fact filmed in Guadeloupe.Episode 1 sees DI Richard Poole of the UK Metropolitan Police seconded to the exotic island from less than exotic London suburb of Croydon, to assist the local police in investigating the murder of an ex pat detective. We quickly get the Caribbean flavour of the island with an under resourced and often laid back police force - as an example, in the first episode we have a goat wandering around the local police station, presumably to emphasise the informal nature of the operation. Poole is quite unaffected and goes about business in what one presumes is his normal modus operandi whilst constantly mopping his brow. How he survived the climate decked out in a dark lounge suit without going down with heat exhaustion is quite a mystery in itself!Murders appear to abound in this tropical paradise. However, it is hard to take it all too seriously between the stereotypical locals and the quintessentially British Poole. I think that some of the plots are so convoluted that they are often more humorous than tense which I imagine is intentional and does make for quite reasonable entertainment. Although in a very different time and setting, Poole's style put me in mind of Poirot - carefully taking everything in and then employing the 'little grey cells' to analyse and pronounce his verdict.This first season consists of eight episodes and we have a second season and hopefully more to come. The final episode finishes with Poole softening his straightlaced outlook somewhat and being reluctantly set to stay on Sainte-Marie.","Death in Paradise Series 1 Set Death in Paradise - Series One  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

16566,"The Guns of Navarone, is in my opinion, one of the best movies of this particular genre made in the sixties.  It stars Gregory Peck; Anthony Quinn; David Niven; Anthony Quayle; and others who are in their own right very accomplished actors.  The story involves a band of saboteurs led by Keith Mallory (Gregory Peck), an officer and veteran mountain climber assigned the unwanted task of destroying two(2) massive Nazi guns, or cannons if you prefer, built inside a mountain located on the Aegean Island of Navarone.  Their mission is to scale a section of the cliffs, which are rarely patrolled by the enemy...and then stealthily gain entrance to the fortified gun emplacement, for the purpose of setting bombs to destroy their objective (The Guns of Navarone).  Should they fail do so, two thousand British Soldiers who are stranded on another nearby island called Kiros, will die from an all out Nazi attack because the British Convoy (sent to rescue them) will most certainly be blown out of the water by the radar controlled guns they must pass to reach their men in time.  The interaction between the different characters in this movie also help make this 1961 war flick one of the blockbuster hits of all times!

1655760,"First, I have to say that after reading the ""5 star"" reviews, my first impression was ""normal people don't talk like that"", and I think I'm right.  I think those reviews were written by people with financial gain hinging on people renting the movie.  The reviews were canned sounding and smacked of sales pitches.  Wouldn't be at all surprised if the reviewers created fake accounts just to review this and other stinking bad movies and get the star ratings up so that more people would watch.  They just sounded totally fake.  In the context of now having watched this awful movie, I feel even stronger that the 5 star ratings are bogus.  The movie stinks.  There's just no other way to say it.This movie was typical low budget, with 1970's technology models, and basically just one set used through 90% of the movie.  The plot was full of holes and unpredictable only in the terms of how low could it go, all except the ending in which, after years of traveling through space, struggling desperately to fix the damaged spacecraft just to get back to earth, (which he is mysteriously able to completely rewire in flight)  the main character for no apparent reason suddenly decides not to go home and be safe and reunited with his family, but instead to go shooting past earth on a suicide mission to resume the original mission plan, with no way to do so, and certain death awaiting him, which made no kind of sense whatsoever.

674254,"This movie is okay - more good than bad - but it has a couple of huge flaws.First, the attraction between Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) and Tom (Richard Ruccolo) is completely unbelievable. There's obviously no real chemistry between the two actors (since Ruccolo is straight), and they're not talented enough to conjure it up out of acting skill alone. Since that relationship is the heart of the movie, its total lack of believable passion is a very serious flaw. Better casting of either (especially Tom) or both roles could have solved it. (Ruccolo looks too much like Ren&eacute;e Zellweger to be sexy anyway, and his shaved chest is a big turn-off.)Second, when Tom, the self-proclaimed martini expert, makes one for Eli, he uses vodka. Now, I know there are idiots in the world who actually do make a drink with vodka which they call a martini, but that doesn't make it a martini. A martini is made with gin, not vodka. Using vodka to make a ""martini"" is like using Crisco to make ""butter"" cookies: you can call the result butter cookies, but that doesn't make them butter cookies.What this movie has going for it are a mostly entertaining and intelligent screenplay (only occasionally irritating and stupid - like the Gone with the Wind bit on the first date, and a few similar times when an only marginally entertaining joke is dragged out way too long; Tom blowing vermouth fumes into the ""martini"" is another clunker); a dynamite comic performance by snarky Adam Goldberg just being snarky Adam Goldberg; a solid performance by Sasha Alexander as the female glue that holds the three male flakes together; and a good enough performance by Bucatinsky to make Eli believable as a person if not as a lover - but even that is more Ruccolo's fault than his. Brief cameos by Doris Roberts and Lisa Kudrow are bonus treats.",All Over The Guy

Watching her go as Forrest Gump's mother was fairly easy as that sequence only consumed a small part of the movie.

Henry Cavill, although chiseled etc., had a constant dumbfounded look on his face like he just didn't understand why the chicken had to get to the other side.  Russell Crowe was the best part of this movie hands down and his presence throughout the film granted the second star in my rating.

[The lighting tells you this is a stage set.] He meets Sister Superior Benedict and the other nuns of the parish school. Earthly honors and rewards are not for them; they do God&#8217;s work. The children recite the Pledge in the new fashion, hand over heart. The school has no playground; they had to sell it to raise money for repairs to the school. [The Great Depression.] Mr. Bogardus tells Father O&#8217;Malley that he wants their school; if they don&#8217;t sell the Town Council will condemn it (eminent domain or zoning). A woman arranges for her daughter to be boarded at school; she needs special help. A new boy gets into trouble. What is the proper way to handle interpersonal conflicts? The Sisters visit a sporting goods store (remember them?) to gain knowledge on a non-scholastic subject. [Note the firearms on open display.] Father O&#8217;Malley helps a young girl with her homework.Young Patricia&#8217;s essay hints at help from an adult. Young Eddie has profited from his extra-curricular education. The Christmas play put on by first-graders shows elegant simplicity. Mr. Bogardus explains his need for their school property - his workers need parking for their cars (a comment on the return of prosperity). The Sisters tell Mr. Bogardus that they want him to donate his new building to their school! [The war time shortages of materials like glass are referenced.] The stress is harming Mr. Bogardus. A long-lost husband is reunited with his wife, and we hear another song. There is a question of school policy as to passing students who are not academic high performers. What is the purpose of schooling? Isn&#8217;t it a means to an end, not an end in itself?Mr. Bogardus suddenly turns over a new leaf, and donates his building to St. Mary&#8217;s! It&#8217;s a miracle. The doctor has bad news: Sister Benedict has TB in an early stage. [This diagnosis was often a death sentence before the antibiotic cure of the 1950s.] She must be sent away for a rest cure, but she cannot be told why (to keep her spirits up and effect a cure). Patsy meets he reunited parents, and things will be different. Patsy graduates to move on to High School. [In earlier times those who finished Grammar School went to work at age 14; their education continued in the workplace.] Was life really so simple in those times? Ingrid Bergman shows her acting ability as Sister Benedict.I remember another reason to explain Mr. Bogardus&#8217; generosity. His plant was land-locked, even if he got a new parking lot. But if he was able to buy a large property outside of town he would have more than enough space and lower taxes too. No traffic problems either. An elderly widow could no longer work her farm. So Father O&#8217;Malley arranged a deal that was a win for all concerned. The availability of plentiful food has put an end to TB in America. From about 1860 to 1950 it was the major cause of death in America. Did we end up with an epidemic of obesity in turn? Its better to die of a heart attack or diabetes at 60 than of TB at 30.

462728,"This is a great film if you know what you're getting: an introspective study of a songwriter's life falling apart. Is he insane or just childish? Are people after him, or is he his own worst enemy? Those questions are answered by the movie's end. Conventional movie watchers who like action or intense drama will hate this.""Who IS..."" is for fans of black humor, in movies like ""Harold & Maude"" & ""Slaughterhouse-5"". There is also a similarity to ""A Thousand Clowns."" It reminds me of Martin Scorsese's criminally-underrated ""King of Comedy"". Both main characters travel through reality, delusions & memories with little explanation to the viewer. Hoffman's songwriter seems like a mixture of Bob Dylan & Howard Hughes. Anyone who wants to know, or remembers what NYC looked like in the early '70's will treasure this. Jack Warden has some amazingly funny bits, showing up in various guises. The film is at its best when Dustin is engaged with other actors. It occasionally suffers from long scenes where he is alone, talking to himself. The slow free-fall beginning is classic.I deduct one star because this is only available on a VHS cassette modified for old TV sets. A widescreen DVD should be released. Also the colors look faded & dull, as if the print was from an old film they used over & over to show on late night TV movies.Just because this is Hoffman's least-known film, does not mean he phones it in.

205536,"Time again to cast some bread upon the waters.This is one of the great American movies, which never seems to appear on anyone's top ten lists.  It's greatness is particularly in the way it portrays the American character and spirit.  It is also infused with Christian meaning, but not overtly.It starts when one man rescues another man much like himself from a lynching.  This is a story at the heart of the Christian message because Jesus was lynched.  And he is all about preventing hot-headed miscarriages of justice.  The protagonist, played by James Stewart, is a man seeking redemption from a past as a raider on the Missouri border during the Civil War, during which time, he survived a lynching.  He helps a wagon train of pilgrims searching for their own promised land, and hopes to join them there if he can escape his past and his reputation.There is a love triangle between him, the man he rescued, who becomes a villain, and the daughter of the pilgrim leader.  The film shows us the transformation that comes over people and a town when gold is discovered, and climaxes, when Stewart's character drowns his best friend and opposite number in the bend in the river.He enters the promised land as the film ends.Why didn't Jesus himself baptize with water?  He could judge a man good or evil on sight.  Perhaps the evil ones wouldn't have come out of the water.  What will happen when Jesus baptizes with fire?  Do some people just burn up?

1522211,"It will no doubt reveal my age when I state that I read Ian Fleming before any movie was ever made. I have enjoyed every film, the good and the bad and have always been fascinated how the Bond films reflect changes in both film making and popular culture.  Sometimes, though rarely, The James Bond of film was close to the image that Ian Fleming had in mind when he wrote the original books back in the 1950's and 1960's based on his own experiences during the Second World War and his own personal demons. Sean Connery's early portrayal and the 2 films starring Timothy Dalton came closest to the original character of our violent and troubled super spy and assassin. The world was apparently not ready for the grim reality of  the literary James Bond and preferred the light hearted spy fantasies of the films with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.  Then came Daniel Craig and the conscious decision by the producers to bring back the James Bond of Ian Fleming's novels. 'Casino Royale' and it's extension 'Quantum of Solace' began the transition successfully. Now we finally have the third film with Daniel Craig and the transition is complete.'Skyfall' is the first James Bond film that can stand on its own independently of the rest of the series. It is a true thriller in the British tradition of  espionage thrillers that go back over 100 years in English thriller novels.  It is no doubt the best film made yet to capture the essence of Ian Fleming's original intent. It will disappoint some who wanted more action, more sexual double entendres, and more humor, but it will please many who have longed for a film that captures the original character and the narrative flow of many of Ian Fleming's novels. Fleming's intent was to recreate the British espionage thriller. 'Skyfall' fulfills that promise in film.Buyers should be aware that this first release of 'Skyfall' is a bare-bones disk and it will be awhile before we get the followup 2 or 3 disc release with all the commentary and bonus features. Personally I am not falling for the studio's get-rich-quick DVD release and will wait for the complete release which I understand will be released in the UK the same day that this abbreviated release set is planned for the USA.UPDATE: Amazon had it wrong in its description of the Blu-Ray. The 2-disc Blu-ray does indeed include commentary and a few extras. The second disc contains digital copies of the film. Unfortunately, the extras are not complete and another release is probably in the future. I hope that it will include the new 1 1/2 hour documentary 'Everything or Nothing'",Skyfall

1570113,"Have not see Jane Bigalow's film ""Zero Dark Thirty"" but I have read ""No Easy Day"" and, while I'm no SEAL Operator (military historian who teaches a course at Lake Region, it doesn't take one to realize several flaws in a military film or see it for what it is.Before I go into any real analysis let me just say that I am NOT a republican.  I, personally, find both parties to be corrupt, out of touch, apathetic to anything/anyone but the security of their own jobs, and other negative phases, metaphors, and adjectives involving several species of leeches.  I hate politicians, period, regardless of political affiliation.Now that THAT is out my system, let us begin.While I love just about any production shown on National Geographic (NATGEO) given their high production value and (usually) strong sense of objectivity, SEAL Team Six came off as a political commercial or pat on the back for President Barrack Obama.  The film dedicates its first ten minutes to barely mention information obtained from a detainee at Guantanamo Bay in 2002 and montages its way to 2010 with LOTS of clips showing President Obama defending his position on hunting for Osama Bin Laden while, curiously, only republican politicians slammed his position.This, the film could have done without and supplemented it with Presidents Bush and Obama talking about an ongoing hunt for Bin Laden or, God forbid, NOT bring in politics at all.  This would have made the first part of the film easier to be taken seriously as it blatantly came across as a political ad... especially given it's on-air release date of November 4th.  However, it didn't end there as the film kept reverting back to the political side showing Obama and Clinton watching a live-feed of the raid when no such thing happened (or so it was reported).  While many would see this as awesome given their political affiliation, it alienates others and, therefor, is not as appealing to the general audience.On to the film itself.  I could tell that the production crew were deeply in love with GoPro cameras as they were featured heavily and much of the on-screen footage came from GoPros.  BTW: when you're showing any camcorder footage as on-screen with the dates in the corner, be sure to keep it within continuity as one scene had 1-31-2011 dated in the corner and immediately cuts to a scene in Hampton Virginia with the dates October 28, 2010 front and center.  Either way, the constant helmet cams and GoPros, while fascinating, were used too much and were used to make the action seem faster when it wasn't.My next criticism involves the format of the film itself.  It self-labels itself as a docudrama, a highly dramatized documentary of sorts even though it's not.  SEAL Team Six presents this with a flashback format as the operators and players are detailing their experiences and feelings after the fact.  Never was really fond of that style as it takes away surprise as well as any riveting sense of excitement: it just goes on and on.  Indeed, SEAL Team Six is, for a lack of a better SAT term that critics love to use, boring.  While there was a little 'excitement' as an old school SEAL butts heads with a younger one he has to take orders from, there was little else.I tried to wait until the end raid and noticed several things that directly contradicted ""Mark Owen's"" account in ""No Easy Day.""  The raid on Bin Laden's compound was portrayed as considerably more... loud than the silent raid depicted in the book.  Granted the scene was still lackluster and failed to keep me on the edge but maybe the trick is keeping the audience on the edge by suspense, not action.  The filmmakers could have have accomplished as much by keeping it suspenseful thus making the film more enjoyable and keeping true with the historical accuracy.Next is the acting and in a word; bland.  While William Fitchner is a grossly under appreciated actor, the rest of the cast did not contribute anything decent.  They just read lines and the story went on.  Oh yeah, they had a rapper from MTV... applause?  Didn't think so.SEAL Team Six could have been a really good film as the production value was high but the story is a good one but for a myriad of reasons it just fell short.  It wasn't exciting, well acted, and tried too hard to push Obama in the spotlight, which is a total turnoff regardless of who the president is.  I don't care of Ronald Reagan comes back from the dead, sticks his head out of the UH-60 Blackhawk to remind the operators to ""Win one for the Gippur!""  It totally turned me off as did the rest of the film.I'm going to try and redeem my time by going to see Zero Dark Thirty tomorrow.  Hopefully, I won't contemplate seppuku afterwards for a double-whamey.",N/A

1382752,"This movie takes a different approach to the well traveled serial killer genre based on factual accounts by the student (Moss) who made Gacy (Forsythe) the theme of his term paper and later a best selling book.The idea of trying to get into the mind of a serial killer is not new and has been used for movies and law enforcement for decades. The departure from other movies in this genre is that a student (Moss) who chose to use Gacy as his project for his term paper who thinks he has the upper hand when dealing with Gacy.  He hopes and thinks that he alone will be able to extract a confession and find out what was his motivation for the killings. He would be able to do what the FBI, psychiatrists local law enforcement weren't able to. The notion that most young people share is their belief that they are smarter and all knowing and that is what led our young student (Moss) down a slippery slope.The movie does a good job of telling this story through the eyes of the student (Moss) and Gacy (Forsythe) as the main focus, but it also reflected the side effects of their relationship with the students (Moss) family and friends.  Moss's characters downward spiraling mental state was played quite convincingly as he deteriorated into a paranoid train wreck. The movie also makes note of Gacy's relationships with the prison guards and just how much latitude he was allowed.Several reviewers have noted the accuracy the movie possessed in relation to the book, but I wonder just how much artistic freedom was used in the telling of this story to make it more interesting to the viewer. The reason I mention this is because I thought that all prisoner mail in and out going is read as well as all inmate calls are recorded. So how did the pictures make it past the screening process? I kind of had a hard time believing Gacy had so much freedom that he could have killed the student. I guess when the student signed the release form the guards didn't care if they broke the rules regarding prison visitors or the fact that their reckless actions were caught on tape. I can't say for sure that they were monitering Gacy's mail and phone calls in 94 or if the mandatory montering (I believe is being done. Remember these guys have ZERO RIGHTS) of all communications started later in the prison system, but since he was so high profile I find it hard to believe they did not check all correspondence. This guy was a convicted pedophile, rapist and murderer who they had to keep under control. They wanted and needed to know if he had other victims and who and where they were.The acting is very good and believable from Moss as well as Forsythe' s characters and their dialogue came across and realistic and was not over played. The director was able to extract very good performances out of Moss and Forsythe that added a good deal of credibility to their given roles. The locations that were used also worked well with adding another layer to the stories credibility.Rating 0 to 5Story = 4+Acting = 4+Direction = 4Fear/Creep Factor =3.6Gore = 2Cursing = 4Sex/Nudity = Yes/NoEntertainment Value = 4Would I watch again = Yes",N/A

1645775,"This movie has a couple of my favorite stars in it. Lily Tomlin is a talented actress (vide her role in The West Wing) as well as a superb comedian.Paul Rudd is a cuddly and adorable love interest, as I fondly recall from Clueless and Friends.The book on which the movie is based is an utterly excellent tour de force of superb writing.So why was this movie a failure?There are several reasons.  For one, the plot bears little resemblance to the plot of the book.  The book was excellent, but its plot was not particularly adaptable into a movie, because plot is not really what the book is about in the first place.For another, the book, while not tragic, is not remotely funny or comedic, and could not have been intended to be.  The heroine's mother in the book is both charmless and damaging; her idiosyncrasies (to use too trivial a word) cause pain to those around her.  There is nothing funny about her.  Nor is there anything funny about the heroine's life, either the events that befall her in the novel or that happened before the book opened.  How anyone imagined that the book could be turned into a comedy--or even a movie with comedic moments--is beyond me.  The book is a comedy in the technical sense that a blossoming romance is involved, but not in any other way.No wonder so many of the reviews described this movie as schizophrenic.  It could not have been anything else, once Hollywood decided it had to be funny.My advice is:  skip the movie.  Buy the book instead.  It is a work of art.",N/A

271522,"Dolph is his usual self in this.  If you're expecting some roundhouse kicks and some usual stunt work from him then you will find that and then some.  His interview on the disc was very telling how he admits getting cast for these films before he knew what in the world he was doing.  He literally took one acting class and was hired out of college where he was a biological scientist of some sort.  So acting was really not supposed to be his calling.The stories plot is based around an alien who comes to earth with some bizarre cd shooting device.  Ok they say it isn't cd's but clearly they are and they bounce around your surround sound and he brings a smile to your face when he announces &#34;I come in peace&#34;.  Which by the way, makes no sense.  Lol.  But, he comes here to harness our endorphins from us overdosing on heroin which is apparently a street drug in his world.  The plot moves along well and there's nothing here surprising.  It is a typical early 90's action film with a hero who seems to conquer a being that is unstoppable.  They actually got two guys that are about 6'8&#34; to play the aliens.  Which makes the fights seem more even.  The movie is for die hard people that enjoyed ridiculous movies like Ninja 3 from shout factory.  This does however seem less comical.  This is definitely more attempting seriousness although failing.  Dolph does what he can with his acting chops but he was never known for being great.  So why give the movie four stars?  Cheese.  Pure early 90's terminator rip offs kind of are my thing.  I watched all the extras.  Dolph still is great and honest about his acting realizing he isn't very good at it.  But let's face facts.  If you're reading this review you must have an interest here.  This is a great group watch if you have movie night at your house like me.  I am disabled and these films I buy maybe one a month to make me laugh and provide entertainment.  If there were more Dolph roundhouse kicks I would have given it a five star rating.  But as it stands four is a solid rating for this baby.  Check it out if you liked the terminator, Rambo or the expendables movies.  You'll enjoy it!",I Come in Peace VHS

1635348,"Having seen several extremely well-done independent film adaptions of H.P. Lovecraft's work over the last few years (seeThe Color Out Of Space,Call of Cthulhu, TheandWhisperer in Darkness, I had high hopes for this full-length feature of one of Lovecraft's best short stories, ""Cool Air"" - but almost from the first moments, I could tell that the creators of this film had no idea how to tell a properly-paced story, or much know much about the importance of location, casting, or creating suspense.  Although I imagine that it's possible to transport Lovecraft's early 20th Century pulp writings to a modern-day setting, putting the action in Malibu, California is a mistake - everything's too sunny and bright; Lovecraft's stories cry out for shadows and Noir-like settings.  The director's wife adapted the story, and she relies FAR too much on pre-title exposition and voice-overs (which is not helped by the droning, emotionless voice of lead actor Morgan Weisser, best known for his role on the short-livedSpace Above and Beyond - The Complete Series), but she also adds loopy, unlikable new characters, as if she were trying to marry Lovecraft with a storyline ripped from Twin Peaks.  The director, not knowing how to build suspense, instead relies almost entirely on ""gotcha"" moments and lame video effects (including repeated images of a goat).  A waste of time and energy by all involved.  Lovecraft purists would do far better to stick withThe H.P. Lovecraft Collection, Vol. 1: Cool Airwhich has the story told to far better effect than this bloated, dull adaption.",Cool Air

I was busy at the time and only got around to seeing it recently.  I wish I had seen it sooner.The movie shows us how William Wilberforce struggled for years to stop British ships from trafficking in slaves.  He was opposed by those who made money from the trade.  William was a young politician who experiences a religious conversion.  At first he considered giving up politics but decides to try to get rid of the slave trade.  He started in 1782 and was unsuccessful for years.  He is supported by a few others devoted to the cause, but for a long time they are unable to convince a majority of the Parliament to stop the trade.  Finally they are successful.I strongly recommend the movie.  If you have not seen it, track down the DVD now.  It is well worth watching.

I am glad those transmissions changed about half way through the series.Other then the few video things that gave me a head ache I did actually enjoy the series.

1150838,"In a nutshell, this film was make to revolt the viewer.  There is no deep meaning or underlying message.  It is a pile of slime with licking popped-out rotten dead eyeballs.  There is also animal violence in this film.  The film maker takes a cute little rabbit and has it murdered so he can make buck.  The murder of the animal is not a special effect. He kills the animal in the most inhumane way possible, making sure the viewer can see the pain and suffering of this innocent living creature.  Then he skins the rabbit's body making sure to get in close for all to see.  Is this art? The director is so proud of killing the rabbit that he shows the skinned carcass over and over again throughout the film.Here is a movie that can be used to get rid of unwanted guests.  Just show it and people will think the host is a perverted creep who enjoys sickness.  This piece of crapola can be found on other Internet cites for about $20.00.  It it total garbage.  It stinks in more ways one can even imagine.  Any film that needs to kill animals to get a rise out of its audience should be relegated to the trash can.",N/A

1441808,"The Kid with a Bike is a heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting film from directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne.  The film centers on Cyril, a young boy who lives in a group home.  Cyril and his bicycle travel through three competing definitions of family as the boy searches for a working definition of family.  Cyril and his bike travel between a deadbeat father, Suzanne--a loving foster mother, and a petty thug.The plot unfolds with Cyril unable to psychologically cope with abandonment and the love offered by his foster family.  This mental crisis is brilliantly played and gut-wrenching to watch.  The most emotionally devastating moment of the film is the slow dawning realization of Cyril's total abandonment by his biological father. These scenes are truly powerful.The Dardenne directors use a conscious minimalism for the film.  The adult characters are only sparingly developed, there are only brief instances of music. It creates the feeling that we are experiencing the world through Cyril's understanding.The Criterion Collection edition features:---New 2K digital transfer, supervised by director of photography Alain Marcoen, with 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition---New conversation between film critic Kent Jones and directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne---Interview with actor C&eacute;cile de France---New interview with actor Thomas Doret---Return to Seraing, a half-hour documentary in which the Dardennes revisit five locations from the film---Trailer---PLUS: A booklet featuring an essay by critic Geoff Andrew",Le Gamin au vélo

1605542,"Terrorvision/Video Dead Blu-ray combo.Scream Factory has resurrected two long lost fan favorites from the home video era and given them the deluxe treatment here.  Either one of these would have made for a great stand-alone release - having both on the same disc is mighty good value indeed.  (A Blu-ray and a DVD disc are included in the pack).The cartoonish ""Terrorvision"" concerns the hapless Puttermans - a kind of hybrid 1950's nuclear family infused with 80's MTV era sensibilities, who install a satellite dish which receives an alien signal (literally), resulting in a living, breathing space monster turning up in the family home.  This film is played deliberately over-the-top and if you're in the right mood for this kind of thing, you'll love it.  The widescreen transfer is eye-popping - absolutely beautiful, with vivid almost startling colors which reveal (much better than on home video) how much care went into the wonderful production design.  Extras include a half hour plus ""making of"" documentary, director and cast commentary track and a poster and still gallery, plus DTS audio.  Basically, throw away your video tapes.I am a card-carrying fan of the ""The Video Dead"" and have waited years for this kind of extras-packed release.  This movie came as close as possible to delivering everything that fans of low-budget video horror and zombie films could have possibly expected at the time (late 80's) - especially for the budget involved - and everybody involved with it should be congratulated both for getting it made in the first place and for the lasting impact it created in fans' memories .When a mysterious TV is mistakenly delivered to a suburban home, ""Zombie Blood Nightmare"" seems to be the only show it plays.  The new owner can't shut it off, and even worse for him, the zombies can't be contained within the set.  They enter the real world, kill him, and then embark upon a suburban zombie killing spree.  And the home's new owners thought this was a good neighborhood!This is great low-budget stuff from director Robert Scott.  There is some real atmosphere here and some innovative ideas about how to deal with the shuffling undead in your neck of the woods.  The zombie make-ups are distinctive and effective, and the tone of the movie is right on the money for fans looking for a fun video night with friends.The widescreen transfer looks great - a little grainy of course, the 16mm film stock is really exposed on dynamic Blu-ray playback settings - but that is to be expected and it only adds to the viewing experience in my opinion.  Audio is solid.  Extras include a ten-minute plus special effects featurette, trailer, poster and still galleries, a .pdf ""Video Dead"" screenplay on the DVD and two audio commentaries - a fan-moderated track featuring the director, editor and special effects supervisor, and a second featuring the same moderator talking to principal cast and technical crew members.  Both are informative, funny and engaging and left me wanting more.This is a must-own for fans.  Buy it now.  Thank you Scream Factory.",N/A

Olivier looks like he needs to give up smoking immediately - and Halle has a 5 oclock shadow in most of the scenes?  Maybe after paying the actor's salaries there wasn't any money left over for a make up artist but seriously- two of the best looking people on the planet and either they look like crap or they are wearing goofy deep sea diving masks with enormous flippers!Next the story - Halle is supposed to be some famous Shark Whisperer who free dives and then cozies up to great whites by reading their body language and not making any bubbles - ridiculous!  All the scary moments are telegraphed so far in advance I was almost screaming ""just attack them already"" to the menacing sharks!

I love seasons 1-3. I bought seasons 4 and 5 just to complete the collection: the stories aren't as strong but they are still good. Season 4 moves slow and finally takes off, season 5 seemed rushed and not fully thought out, but since this is about season 3: I do recommend it!",The Wire: Season 3

1500924,"It can be difficult for the average person to really understand history, unless you fictionalize some tiny detail and then pull back to see what else was going on.  To some degree, that's the benefit of a film like Argo - it tells a great story, in the context of a recent event, and leaves you with some insight into what actually happened around it.  Ben Affleck is great as Tony Mendez, the CIA extraction specialist with nerves of steel.  Bryan Cranston is also excellent as his mercurial boss, but his Hollywood allies, played by Alan Arkin and John Goodman, make this improbable story believable.  Definitely the Best Picture of 2012.",Argo

The tittle is right for the movie and tells how Cora feels and acts in her life. Unashamed to love and care. Some subject matter may not be good for children. I think teenagers(girls) though would really like this movie and appeals to different races also. It is mostly a woman's movie, no guns or car chases for sure. But a very thoughtful , heartfelt movie about life and how it affects mostly the choices women make.

1657029,"I went to see this on a recommendation of a friend and I was disappointed. I can't say it is a bad movie but I wanted to point out the flaws. Ultimately this movie has been done many times before... and much better. I couldn't help but see similarities between this and ""Meatballs.""14 year old Duncan is shy and awkward and stuck going on vacation with his mom, jerk of a boyfriend, and his daughter. Yes this is not going to be a good summer. Upon his arrival, his neighbors offer some option for companionship but being awkward, friendship with the older pretty girl next door isn't likely. So Duncan follows this charismatic manager of the local water park, Owen. Owen, like Bill Murry in Meatballs... is funny and doesn't take life too seriously. Owen also sees that Duncan needs someone to believe in him badly. In essence, Owen is a camp counselor here... just the camp is the water park. Owen hires Duncan and via the employment and support Duncan blossoms, increasing in confidence until in the end he helps his mom leave her jerk boyfriend and gets a kiss from the pretty girl next door.A simple story. Too simple for me. The movie ends awkwardly without much of a pay off. Duncan's transformation doesn't feel earned but rather rushed to get it in for the end. It is touched on for a second but Owen's character raises the question of responsibility much more than in Meatballs. Owen is a park manager... and he acts like a camp counselor (pawning off the work on everyone else). But the movie doesn't want to dwell on any larger issues.  Also the actor who played Duncan probably isn't going to win any academy awards anytime soon. Finally I have NO idea what the title refers to.",N/A

The storyline is strange and it's scary to think that there are women in the world as stupid as Nicole Kidman's character.  Zac Efron winds up being the hero (believe it or not) and the last five minutes of the movie are the most suspenseful.

This film stays very true to the original story with very few omissions, and one forgivable, brief addition (Scrooge is plunged into an uncomfortable afterlife, where he must wear the chains of greed he has forged).

1500911,"""Argo,"" among the nominees for the 2012 Best Picture Academy Awards, may very well be the best film of 2012, and Ben Affleck may very well be the best director. Unlike other frontrunners, ""Lincoln"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""Argo"" is a movie-movie. Like those other two films, it tells a true story, but unlike those other two, disappointing films, ""Argo"" is not a starchy and lumpy docudrama. ""Argo"" is a smoothly running machine.""Argo"" tells a gripping story in a gripping way, never preaching (""Lincoln""), never getting too caught up in one aspect of the story to distort the narrative line (""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lincoln."") ""Argo"" wants to entertain you, and it does. It's a thriller. My palms were sweating as much while watching this movie as while watching an old-fashioned suspense flick by Alfred Hitchcock, even though, like most viewers, I know how the story ends. I found the opening scene of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran so frightening I could hardly watch it. This is all the  more remarkable given that I'd heard a radio interview in which Affleck joked about finding only older actors to perform the part of the ""students"" storming the embassy.""Argo""'s cast is full of actors I know well, have seen in many other films, and whom I like a lot: Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Victor Garber, Bryan Cranston. It's testimony to the film's power that I stopped thinking about these actors and got lost in the characters they were playing.""Argo"" tells the true story of a CIA plot to release six Americans from Iran during the hostage crisis. The plot: pretend that the six Americans are Canadians there to scout locations for an upcoming Sci-Fi flick.John Goodman and Alan Arkin are utterly believable, funny, and moving as the Hollywood part of the team. There's a brilliant, throwaway scene in which Alan Arkin and Richard Kind bargain over the price of a movie script. The scene doesn't advance the plot, but the dialogue is perfect and fast. It's just a witty respite in a tense movie about a life-and-death situation. Ben Affleck is perfect as a CIA operative. He keeps his cards very close to his chest.Farshad Farahat plays an amazingly hairy airport guard. He screams in Farsi. Most audience members, not speaking Farsi, will have no idea what this man is saying - there are no subtitles. Even so, we are terrified. Farahat deserves an award for his brief but pivotal performance as the face and voice of the enemy the entire world now confronts, an enemy driven by incoherent, focused, murderous rage.""Argo"" has a little bit of heartwarming family drama, a little bit of arcane CIA in-shop detail, a little bit of Hollywood behind-the-scenes banter, a very little bit of nightmarish torture. It never lingers in one type of scene too long; it just glides along, telling its story as economically and movingly as possible.",Argo

1623337,"First off, let's just get something out of the way. ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" never had a chance to succeed. With a paradoxical title like that, audiences are given a red flag immediately. If the producers of a movie can't decide on a better name for a film, then how could they make bigger decisions during production? Just pick a name! Was ""Ghosts of Georgia"" any more generic than ""The Haunting in Connecticut?"" The reason I sound so frustrated is because it deserves better.The Wyrick family moves into a country house in Georgia. Their daughter, Heidi, soon begins telling her parents she talks to a man who warns they're in danger. Upon investigating, they find out their house is located on land once owned by a stationmaster of the Underground Railroad. The souls of the slaves are restless and begin haunting the family for unknown reasons.Director Tom Elkins and writer David Coggeshall put together quite an impressive ghost story with ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia."" While ""based on a true story,"" it's obvious some creative license is utilized to spice things up. However, there are some genuinely frightening moments that will resonate with viewers. Let's just say Elkins and Coggeshall know our innermost fears and exploits them.The entire cast of ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" put forth their best efforts and embrace their individual characters. You can tell they took the material seriously and ran with it. Chad Michael Murray plays the father of the family. Abigail Spencer takes on the role of the mother. Katee Sackhoff portrays Spencer's free-spirited sister who comes to live with them. Emily Alyn Lind is perfect in as the little girl Heidi. She embraces the role straight-faced with an air of authentic innocence.The audio and video high definition transfers for the film are good. The picture is clean and the colors all breathe life into the visual experience. My only problem with how the movie looks are the ""dimensional"" sequences and the way they're shot, edited, and colored. They give it a cheap, straight-to-DVD feel that is distracting. The 5.1 surround sound mix provides all the immersive bumps, slams, jarring musical blares, screams, and haunting whispers horror fans have come to expect from these types of films.Special features for ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" will satisfy consumers. Audio commentary is provided by Director Tom Elkins, Writer David Coggeshall, and Co-Producer Brad Kessell. There's a 10-minute featurette in which we meet the real members of the Wyrick family and hear their experiences firsthand. Deleted scenes with optional commentary, outtakes, and a theatrical trailer are included as well.""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" is a good supernatural tale that should have been released in theaters like its predecessor. There are nice twists to the story, the acting is good, and the scares are genuinely creepy. Maybe it's selfish, but I was looking forward to seeing the movie on a big screen in a quiet atmosphere where it could have my full attention.

209619,"As a film, ""Mommie Dearest"", is a mixed bag. It essentially tells the story of reported child abuse by one of America's top Golden Age of Hollywood stars, Joan Crawford. The film is based on the book of the same title by Miss Crawford's adopted daughter, Christine. Whether the abuse, or all of it, actually happened, has been debated over the years, and this review is making no claims one way or the other.The movie starts out well enough and I basically think it was well crafted, written, and acted (not including the 3 scenes where Faye Dunaway's ""interpretation"" of the scenes have made the film a joke to many). Other than Miss Dunaway's aforementioned 3 scenes), Faye does an amazing job of becoming Miss Crawford. Same goes for Diana Scarwid, Steve Forrest, and the rest of the cast. The production values are top notch, as is the score, set design, lighting, and costuming.This DVD pressing has pretty good quality for a DVD, and is a fairly clean print with mostly saturated colors, nice black levels, and normal film grain (not the overly noisy mess you see lately with some Blu Rays that are claimed to be film grain which is just an excuse to release a noisy, blurry, and sub par product).  The audio is a newly mixed 5.1 Dolby Digital English language soundtrack, an improvement over the mono, though the rear channels could have been utilized a bit more.",N/A

Dexter, as her man-child friend and love interest, shows character development as he grows and matures during the unfolding story.

This very informative and interesting DVD provides a short history and the development of martial art action films in China.  This 96 minute film is narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and shows highlights from numerous action martial art films such as Once Upon a time in China, The one-armed swordsman, crouching tiger, hidden dragon, Rush Hour 2, and numerous other early classic Chinese martial art films.This DVD also includes various interviews with legendary film makers like Ang Lee, John Woo, the Shaw brothers, Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, and many other well-known martial art people.  In total there are short scenes from over 100 movies, some of these include very early Chinese films have never been shown before this time. One of the interesting facts about these early martial art films is that many of these roles were played by women martial art experts.In conclusion, if you are a martial art movie fan, you may want to check out this interesting ""The Art of Action"" DVD. The historical aspects combined with various clips of scenes and the interviews make this an entertaining movie to watch.Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J.

1657613,"1st off, I have never been to Sea World; and I DO NOT approve of, nor condone, the capture of wild animals (or mammals) for entertainment purposes.That said, this is the most ridiculous and dishonest ""documentary"" I've seen in quite a while.""Sea World"" is going to threat this the same as anyone, or any other 'entity' would, in an event where a WILD ANIMAL (in this case, Wild Mammal) attacks &/or kills someone... There's no ""great conspiracy"" here; and to suggest otherwise is obscene.  Using anyone's death, to promote your personal agenda, regardless of the facts, is obscene, no matter how you try to skew it.A woman is dead... it is what it is... it happens, in every conceivable ""entity"", PUBLIC & PRIVATE -- THEY'RE WILD ANIMALS/MAMMALS -- it's just way more common for the Public Entities (aka: Zoos)... but they all behave & blame, the same way, afterward: ""Trainer error"", or whatever... because, as these dummies have proven, yet again, some people just can't accept the truth, no matter how how simple that truth is, so they have to blame the deceased, to keep from being sued by an idiot, litigious society &/or family members, who want to place blame everywhere, except where belongs.Moreover, 99% of everyone interviewed in this ""film"" who talk about the ""traumatized psychosis"" of these KILLER whales -- are not qualified, nor schooled, in the psychology of ANY species... And none, have clearly conducted a formal or informal psychoanalytical study of a whale's behavior before, during, and after ""capture"" -- Therefore, 99% of everything presented in this ""documentary"" as ""fact"" by the FEW semi-qualified to speak on such a matter, is still pure speculation & conjecture.-- And the people who SHOULD have been interviewed, weren't... or... those interviews didn't reflect the pre-determined ""message"" the Director wanted to put out, so they were discarded & left out of the, LOL, ""documentary"".That said, yes, common sense would dictate they (captured 'wilds') COULD & MAY VERY WELL BE ""scarred"" by the events... But there's NO evidence the Orcas ARE, nor, any other ""captured"" animal, mammal, reptile, etc.However, COMMON SENSE would also dictate, that these Trainers CHOSE A DANGEROUS PROFESSION, AND SOMETIMES, THAT DANGER BECOMES REALITY -- IT HAPPENS -- THEY KNOW THIS GOING IN & CHOOSE TO DO IT ANYWAY... JUST LIKE POLICE OFFICERS & FIRE FIGHTERS (only the former's is a million times more certain)!!Clearly, these people made their choice to work with these Dangerous Animals/Mammals... You don't blame the Animal/Mammal for the accident(s) because ""they're just animals and don't know any better"", or whatever... Well, you can't blame the ""entity"" either, because THEY DID NOT FORCE THE TRAINER TO BE A TRAINER, TO WORK THERE, etc.; and no matter how ""humanely"" a wild animal/mammal is captured, transported, and housed... it is, and will always be, (in this case, a LARGE), DANGEROUS, LETHAL THING... and no amount of ""training"" will remove that aspect of its nature!!-- I swear, it's like all notions of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY are as foreign as Orcas are to land!And the quote, ""There's no record of any Orca being violent in the wild"", was by far the most ludicrous of the countless, insane ramblings, offered up.  -- THEY'RE CARNIVOROUS (""KILLER"") WHALES YOU IDIOT!!!Plus, as if you can honestly compare the millions of hours of CONSTANT observation done in captivity, to A FEW HOURS of GLIMPSED ""activity"" out in the open ocean, as an actual comparison-argument... LOL; but they try, along with every other conceivable way, to mislead, and lie, rather than have an OPEN AND HONEST DEBATE about whether we should/shouldn't have captive 'wilds' at all (in 'Public' or 'Private' entities).-- Personally, I would be 100% fine if every 'wild' was returned to the wild, set free, and all Zoos, etc., were closed entirely/permanently... but that will never happen... And these attacks, while extremely rare, will continue.Regardless, this is without question, the most insane, ideologically inept, maddening, and brain-numbing piece of crap, this year... possibly, of all time.",N/A

After writing an article she is passionate about she quits when it won't get published and ends up moving back home. While she is trying to make sense of her life she gets a job as a lifeguard and reconnects with her parents and her old friends. Leigh learns the meaning of 'you can't go home again'. There is a saying you can't judge a book by its cover, after watching this one it should also be applied to movies. Going off the cover I expected a nice light comedy with Kristin Bell playing her usual character. I got the exact opposite. The movie is a heavy drama with very real issues. After moving home she finds that her friends are not who they once were and neither are her parents. She begins a romance with an underage boy at the place where she works which has repercussions for everyone. This is nothing like I expected but I did really like it much more then I expected.

277264,"When the review count is 122 - 5 star reviews to 2 - 1 star reviews it should be understood that this is a crowd pleasing movie. Cannery Row is a mash up of the continuing story lines in Steinbeck's comic novels Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday. It comfortably captures the spirit of fun, offkilter, out of the mainstream - and bend the conventions comedy of the novels. Among the several things the movie offers that the book cannot is the brilliant, polyphonic lively New Orleans Jazz that only Dr. John can perform.Against the purists who do not like bringing together these two books under one title, or who insist that the books are better one can only accept that these criticisms are valid and totally irrelevant.The youngish Nick Nolte lives inside of Doc, the Marine biologist and spiritual heart of this retiring community, as if it was his second skin. Nolte achieves more with his crushed hat and facial expressions than most actors would attempt. Squeaky voiced Debra Winger is a natural for the inquisitive not entirely innocent love interest who invades this almost closed depression era non-traditional community. M. Emmet Walsh and Audra Lindley leading respectively the bums of Cannery Row and the floozies of the Bear Flag Restaurant provide to the ensemble, beautifully performed cast support . John Houston as narrator was always a classy touch and even his tone of voice captures the slightly off center humor of the entire piece.Individual scenes such as the ""frog massacre"" and the subsequent frog-based shopping spree could have been made into an award-winning stand - alone film short.Allowing for two of the more comically narrated  fight scenes in moviedom, this is another low-key brilliantly executed, very little happens, romantic comedy that provides me with exactly the kind of light entertainment I like.  The books were fun, I enjoyed reading them and probably will reread them again. The movie is as much fun and I may wear out this DVD.",Cannery Row VHS

1611024,"I was happy to see Atlas Shrugged get a deserved Part II.  The message in Part II comes through even stronger in this film, even moreso than the first.  The book by Ayn Rand is so immense, that I think it would have been better served as a 10-part miniseries.  There's SO much information and the plot is so dense, that even spanning it over three 2-hour films feels rushed.  Relationships and plot elements ""just happen"" because the story has to keep moving.  There's so much ground to cover.Aside from that fact, the acting is well done.  I know there were major cast changes to the principle roles from Part I, particularly Dagney and Reardon.  I didn't think those changes added anything to the film.  I really enjoyed both actors from the first film.  While Samantha Mathis also does a great job here as the new Dagney, Michael Biehen as Reardon (who I've loved in other things) just seems too worn out and tired of a guy to take on the world in this epic battle.  He's also significantly older than the previous actor, who I really missed.Production values are overall, pretty good.  I'd heard they raised the budget for this installment and that the effects were much better than Part I.  I didn't see any real problem with the Part I effects.  Having said that, there are moments in this film, where the CGI is SO bad, it's cringe-worthy.  Most of the wide, geographical vistas look completely phoney and the plane crash sqeuence that opens and closes the film looks so fake, it seems like a video game image.  I'm stunned than anyone would accept that in the final cut.  The film ""Alive"" did one of the most famous plane crash sequences ever put to film with NO CGI and that was over 20 years ago.  Why didn't the director take a ""less is more"" approach when handling that scene?The best part about this film is its message and it's even more central in this installment.  Reardon, during his congressional indictment hearing, Francisco and a few others have great monologues that make profound statements.  I'm giving this film 5 stars for its timeliness and courage to put forth a message that a sleepwalking American public needs to hear at the 11th hour, with its best days seemingly behind it.It's the oldest trick in the book.  Whenever anyone wants to control another person or group of people, you have to make them AFRAID first.  Fear is the real weapon.  Once you make them afraid, you simply propose a solution that will ""protect"" them from that big, scary problem (and serve YOUR interests at the same time).  It's the easiest way to get people to agree to things they would NEVER logically consent to outright.I'm NOT a conservative, Republican or even a Democrat.  One need only look at America's history over the last 100 years and you can easily see the ""problem-reaction-solution"" game that's been played by self-serving government powerbrokers to further their own interests, whittle away freedoms and make the citizenry even more subordinate to them.  No matter where you stand on the issues, it's VERY clear that more government involvment in anything is NEVER a good thing.  The US government was originally intended to be VERY, VERY small, with only 39 specific duties delegated to it.  Whether it's gun control, government sponsored ""free"" healthcare or anything else; the result is always the same.  In return for ""protection"", you get more regulation and less freedom.  Americans need to wake up.  Atlas Shrugged is happening NOW and as long as there are those who refuse to exert their own power, there will be those more than willing to take it from them...in return for ""protection"".",Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike

1602120,"Everyone is well aware of the ups and downs of actor Charlie Sheen's life over the past few years. Some love him, some hate him, but for the most part I think the majority of American's have the same opinion about these well publicized turmoil's: who cares?Celebrities seem to garner attention for the worst behavior possible and people these days seem to think that's cool. It doesn't say much for us does it?But Sheen has come back from the wild ways he displayed and attempted to not only create a new series that he can star in but that can poke fun at his past behavior at the same time. ANGER MANAGEMENT stars Sheen as Charlie Goodson, an ex-major league baseball player who in a fit of rage tried to break a bat over his leg...only to injure himself instead and thus ending his career. Seeing the light so to speak he in turn became an anger management therapist with a successful private practice. He still occasionally finds himself on the verge of anger but seems to catch it most times.Charlie's main focus is on a group he offers therapy to in his home. They run the stereotypical range from grumpy old guy to total whack job girlfriend. While some of these characters have moments that might make you laugh on the whole they become more cardboard cutouts than actual people you get to know.Charlie's character has situations he's chosen to be involved in here that become focal points of various episodes. For one he's divorced but still of fairly good grounds with his ex. Well good in the sense of average sit-com good. Shawnee Smith stars in this role and she's had better parts but holds up well here. The two share a daughter in her early teens which makes for some storylines as well. Of course the things Charlie wants for his daughter and how he wants her to behave are far different from the young girls he hits on throughout the series.When he's not attempting to bed a young girl he meets randomly he's involved with another therapist played by Selma Blair. While the two are involved in a friends with benefits relationship they agree that for this to take place they can't become a therapist for each other...which of course Charlie ends up trying to weasel around when he can.The series is a hit and miss mixture of old stories we've seen before with new attempts to push the envelope as far as it can with sexual taboos. Some episodes are actually hilarious while others just sit there. Never having thought TWO AND A HALF MEN was the funniest thing ever made I thought this series was perhaps even a tad below that level of humor. Watching stars on the tail end of their age bracket and careers involved in sex comedy isn't my cup of tea.Actually that part is rather sad when you think about it. Sheen has acting ability as seen in so many projects he's done in the past. When he took on the role in his previous series he became a caricature of the aging lothario whose life was nothing more than a series of women he attempted to or succeeded in bedding each week. Unfortunately his real life began to mimic this character rather than be an escape from it and that began to inflict itself into that show, enough so that he left. In this show he plays almost the same character with minor differences. It would be nice to see Sheen go back to fulfill the potential he displayed in films like PLATOON rather than this sort of knock off series.On its own perhaps this series can be recommended for a few episodes and some of the jokes can be funny. The problem is you have to sit through the rest of it to get to these gems which are few and far between. Sheen fans who love his off screen antics will fall in love with this character. Those wanting to see a more mature actor will have to wait.",N/A

986401,"This is the American version of the Japanese movie Gojira which was the first and best Japanese monster movie.  Godzilla was the American version which took the original Gojira and cut it to a less preachy movie regarding atomic radiation into a more Americanized action movie.  There is some dialog regarding the dangers of atomic radiation but is minimized whereas the the Japanese version uses the movie as an exciting, scary and cautionary tale that only the one country in the world where atomic bombs were dropped on can speak to.  The monster is renamed Godzilla and the narrator is an American reporter played by Raymond Burr, who is stopping over in Japan on his way to Cairo.  Why flying over The Pacific  gets you to Cairo rather than flying across the Atlantic is not explained but is just a little quirk in the dialog.  The movie is all action and you get to see the destruction of Tokyo with superior modeling and special affects that still are fresh today.  The ending is exciting as well.  This movie's title, Godzilla, gave birth to the Godziila series of movies throughout the decades which as a Godzilla fan, I still enjoy and own every DVD.  I look forward to the new Godzilla movie coming out in 2014.  I highly recommend this movie and the original Japanese movie Gojira that gave it birth.","Gojira / Godzilla, King of the Monsters"
131357,"And to me, the story this film is based on is a classic.  And so is the cartoon.  So I am happy to say, in my eyes, this movie is also a classic.  The music is wonderful, the sets and landscapes are perfectly dark and scary, the stars selected for their parts were selected with a eye towards fitting their characters.  Johnny Depp plays his Ichabod Crane as a man of SCIENCE but also a man who can't really stand the sight of blood and becomes easily scared when his world view that ghosts and goblins don't exist is threatened by what may be a REAL ghost.  The story starts out as a simple murder mystery (well, not THAT simple) which soon becomes more complex with a dead man's will, a witch (or two), and the Headless Horseman who may, or may not, be real.  The Headless Horseman is played by a real stunt man, not a computer generated spirit, so much of the fighting is real.  But the movie is not supported by special effects alone but by the strength of the performance from the actors, the solid and detailed story, and the gritty, muddy, landscape that they used for the Sleepy Hollow.  I would suggest this for any film library but it is rated R, so kids should not be watching it.  And maybe some adults should not either, as while not THAT scary, there is a lot of blood and some upsetting scenes.",N/A

395244,"&#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; (1971) is one of the best adult films in the truest sense of the term: a film for grownups. Peter Finch, who would win a posthumous make-up Oscar for &#34;Network (1976) and Glenda Jackson, in between her Academy Awards for &#34;Women in Love&#34; (1970) and &#34;A Touch of Class&#34; (1973), play the two feet of a romantic triangle whose apex is the bland beauty/conceptual artist played by Murray Head.Working from a brilliantly textured screenplay by Penelope Gilliatt, herself a film critic, this British film interweaves every scene and character into a commentary on contemporary relationships, especially marriage, or the lack thereof. Glenda Jackson's character is Alex Greville, a divorcee who is the only child of very comfortable but deeply unhappy parents.(Peggy Ashcroft brings a lifetime's worth of experience and skill to the small but telling role of the mother who has accepted her husband's indifference and financial preoccupations.) Alex works as a jobs counselor, in particular for a hard-to-place 50+ year old man with whom she has a one night stand. How she met the decade younger self absorbed artist whose &#34;affections&#34; and sexuality she shares with the middle-aged family doctor, Daniel Hirsh, played by Peter Finch, we never learn. Nor do we learn how the good doctor met the young man, although they have friends in common: the decidedly progressive parents of a brood of 5 children, the first 4 of whom have ready access to their parents' stash of pot and are spectators to their parents' bathing. It says everything that the chief family pet is a mastiff named Kenyatta.Director John Schlesinger came to prominence in the British cinema with such witty and penetrating portraits of the 1960's as &#34;Billy Liar&#34;(1963) and &#34;Darling&#34;(1965) and &#34;went Hollywood&#34; with his 1969 initially X-rated Oscar winner &#34;Midnight Cowboy&#34;. Here in the London of the new decade, Schlesinger is working well within his comfort zone. A gay artist who was the son of a doctor and a musician, one who knew from experience the world of aspirational upper middle class Jewish life, Schlesinger employs the music of Mozart very effectively to comment on his central triangular relationship and renders perhaps the perhaps the most realistic Bar Mitzvah ceremony and reception ever presented in an apolitical context. Every movement, gesture, line of dialogue and character helps to establish both Dr. Hirsh's family and cultural life and the fact that, while loving, he is a perennial outsider in his own world. Bob Elkin, the object of Daniel's misplaced affection, plays both his older lovers. While ostensibly loving freedom, he's off to America to pursue his career at the end of the film. Alex is left with his toucan, Daniel with Italian language records for a trip never taken.&#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; swept the BAFTA awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Editing, yet in spite of 4 major nominations, was kept at arm's length by the deeply conservative (American) Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. While I can't quarrel with the choice of Jane Fonda as Best Actress for &#34;Klute&#34;, Peter Finch's deeply felt, extraordinarily intelligent and observant performance was both a landmark in a career that stretches back to &#34;The Nun's Story&#34; (1959) and the most sympathetic and genuine representation of a gay character on screen before Heath Ledger's tortured sheepherder (he's not a cowboy for the bulk of the movie, although he rides a horse) in &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34; (2005). Why then didn't Finch win? One guess is that Academy members weren't willing to accept a man on man kiss rendered with (seeming) affection and conviction. Thirty four years later, some of the same Academy members weren't ready to accept a highly suggestive if darkened rendering of gay sex in a tent involving Ledger and co-star Jake Gyllenhaal.With the wisdom of hindsight, &#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; and &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34; are much more worthy of re-viewing and re-consideration than either  &#34;The French Connection&#34; (1971) or &#34;Crash&#34;.(2005) The Schlesinger film is the one receiving the consummate care that comes with being a Criterion Blu-ray selection. The accompanying booklet satisfies both the casual viewer and the film scholar. The cinematography of Billy Williams and the mostly Mozartean score appeal to our eyes and ears. The authenticity of the performances and the continued relevance of the subject matter make &#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; as much a part of 2013 as it was of 1971.The one dated aspect of the film is technological. The characters rely on dial phones and an answering service, personified by silent screen star Bessie Love (1928 Best Actress nominee for &#34;Broadway Melody&#34;) in their attempts to communicate with each other. In today's smart phone/texting world, this seems laughable, but in 1971 such was the reality and the heightened frustrations of the three main characters caused by missed calls seem entirely apt.",Sunday Bloody Sunday VHS

The only suspense is the lead character trying to convince the police that what he says is true.So what is good about this film?  The acting is good (unless you hate Ray Milland) even though the plot can confuse the hell out of you with all the loose ends, but if you just let the film unwind and you go with the flow, it becomes an enjoyable spy picture.It seems that this picture was NOT a ""Fritz Lang picture"" in that he did not have complete control, others controlled the script, but even with that he did a good job of setting up the scenes and the lighting and photography are really good.

1669596,"When D.W. Griffith's massive epic INTOLERANCE was released in 1916, it was a commercial failure. This was due in part to its pacifist stand on war at a time when America was at the brink of entering the European conflict, and also because of its complex narrative structure which many people found difficult to follow. Griffith himself spent the rest of his life paying off the debts INTOLERANCE incurred as perhaps the most expensive film ever made. None of these perceived failings matter when viewing the film, which retains all of its power to amaze and move an audience as it did the day it premiered.Originally planned as a much shorter film that Griffith called THE MOTHER AND THE LAW which dealt with a contemporary setting, the story was expanded to include three other episodes taken from history: the fall of Babylon, the crucifixion of Christ, and the Huguenot massacre. Griffith's innovative plan was to intercut the stories and jump back and forth between them, showing how the same themes of human injustice and intolerance have persisted from earliest times to our modern day. Not only was the narrative structure unconventional and ambitious, but the entire production was mounted on a scale unprecedented in American cinema at that time. Costumes were authentic in every detail, while the sets - particularly the Babylonian wall, gate, and courtyard - were the largest ever built for a movie.INTOLERANCE features excellent performances by the entire cast which includes Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Miriam Cooper, Walter Long, Constance Talmadge, Alfred Paget, Seena Owen, Tully Marshall, Margery Wilson, Eugene Pallette and Howard Gaye. Lillian Gish plays the key role of the mother who endlessly rocks the cradle of time, linking all four stories. The film is alternately beautiful, compelling, and disturbing in its vivid imagery and never ceases to fascinate in the way it combines intimate drama with opulent spectacle. As broad as it is in its scope, INTOLERANCE pulsates with passionate emotion. In many ways it is unsurpassed in its attempt to cinematically depict humanity's struggle throughout history. No other film tried to tackle again what Griffith gives us in INTOLERANCE, and that alone is something to admire.Cohen Media Group's newly restored Blu-ray of this silent masterpiece is a revelation. Scanned at 2K/1080p, the images leap off the screen with remarkable clarity for a movie that's nearly a century old. Over those decades INTOLERANCE has had a frustrating existence with numerous cuts, snippets, alternate takes, and varying projection speeds so that it's virtually impossible to pin down a ""definitive"" version. This edition has by far the best overall combination of extant footage and image quality consistency, and includes the original tints as per its initial roadshow engagement. The magnificent Carl Davis music score in 5.1 and 2.0 audio adds a new, epic dimension that makes us appreciate even more the power of this film. Extras include the shorter features THE MOTHER AND THE LAW and THE FALL OF BABYLON both with new scores by the Mont Alto Orchestra, a retrospective by historian Kevin Brownlow, the restoration trailer, and a booklet with essays by Richard Porton and William M. Drew.This extraordinary, influential classic is mandatory viewing for every cinema lover, and I give this outstanding Blu-ray my highest recommendation.",N/A

1598011,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (but hopefully not too many major ones).DISCLAIMER: I do actually like this show and plan on sticking with it, because I'm OCD and must see things through to the end. That being said, every show has a bad season - Buffy had the snooze-fest of season four, Angel had the truly terrible baby plot line in season three, Smallville had a dull-as-dishwater-Zod in season nine, and ... well, this is TVD's bad season. (I hope, because it's a mess and I'd hate to sit through another one.) The thing is, when the show is good, it's really good, and when it's bad, it's incredibly bad.Watching this season reminded me of reading ""Breaking Dawn."" It started out promising then turned into total crap, but I kept reading hoping for the EPIC RESOLUTION that would make up for 500 pages of self-defeating, totally illogical bull that preceded it. Lo and behold, instead of an epic resolution, I got 40 pages of pontificating and vampires standing around glaring at each other, before everyone went home; a big buildup, the promise of epic violence, and ... no payoff.In a nutshell, this is how season four of ""The Vampire Diaries"" plays out: a promising start, an epic build-up, some decent character moments, the threat of deathly peril and then... total crap. Not only is the pacing way off (long gone are the days of the series actually being creepy, and having episodic cliffhangers), it breaks all its formerly-established ""vampire rules,"" spends way too much time on unimportant things and not enough on its villain, introduces pointless characters for one or two episodes rather than using and developing existing ones, and the finale, while ""good,"" is so rushed, I felt most of it SHOULD have been a three or four episode arc at the end of the season.The wasted opportunities this season are endless, particularly the finale: the writers bring back a bunch of vengeful hybrids, werewolves, vampires, and dead witches, and you don't really see them DO ANYTHING BAD in town! Where's the hell-raising Kol promised us? Where's him capturing Elena and torturing her for days? Where's Klaus having to face down his twelve angry, undead, can't-be-killed hybrids? It's a MAJOR LET DOWN, and worse, a missed opportunity. Sadly, it didn't shock me because the entire season is like that.Breaking established ""rules of the universe"" in a series (or book, for that matter) is lazy, sloppy, and convenient, the epitome of bad writing. Here, they do it multiple times - baby vampires get the upper hand on much older ones (including an Original), a hybrid-werewolf baby is conceived, the sire bond isn't as rare as they said, and for that matter, neither are doppelgangers. Relationships are convenient rather than developed; characters are underused; consistently, the writers promise us something great and fail to deliver. Kol promises us hell on earth if Silas is freed - it never arrives; Klaus promises vengeance for Kol - it doesn't happen; Klaus swears vengeance on Tyler - and does nothing.None of the originals care when one of them is killed - and Elijah even goes so far as to comfort his brother's murderer, with nary a mention of his senseless death (and no, the show's justification is invalid, since there's a witch in Mystic Falls capable of stopping Kol). The writers then have him turn around a few episodes later and spend half of an episode trying to convince Klaus how important it is to preserve family. (WUT?)Granted, it all doesn't suck, and the first half of the season is even good. There's a few standout episodes, such as the aftermath of the Jeremy plot twist. Klaus' presence in the Christmas episode is unforgettable. Elijah continues to be fabulous, particularly when turning up in New Orleans. Damon and Elena have a nice moment together in the finale. Plus, it included the pilot episode for ""The Originals,"" which between Elijah (who, me, biased? Never!) and Marcel (who out-awesome-s Klaus by ten million miles) may be a lot of fun next fall.Will I be watching it next season? Yes. I didn't give up on Buffy, Angel, or Smallville after their crappy seasons. Hopefully, this is just a stumble and not an indication of the future of the series, because in spite of its faults, I do like ""The Vampire Diaries""... and I want to see it get back on form.Or at least have some sort of a PLAN next season.",N/A
1670452,"&#34;The Lord does not believe in actions without consequences.&#34; The New Mexico territory in the late 1800's is full of danger. When Sarah, a young wife (Jones) encounters the local preacher (Isaacs) and a sheriff (Harris) who isn't totally sane. When she refuses the preacher's advances her life is forever changed. Now with the help of the sheriff she sets out for revenge, and you know what they say about a woman scorned. I am a huge Ed Harris fan and I like westerns but lately the genre has been in a huge nose dive so I wasn't sure what to expect from this. This is easily one of the better ones that have come out lately but it is still a little slow moving. 90% of the reason this is good is the cast. Harris is good in everything, Isaacs is the most disturbing preacher since Michael Parks played one in Red State. The gem of the movie though is January Jones. For once she isn't just the eye candy of the movie, she actually has a needed part and the fact that it is her that loses it and goes on a killing spree makes it that much more interesting. If you are a western fan this is one to watch. Don't expect something like Open Range though, this is more like Appaloosa or 3:10 To Yuma or for you real movie fiends out there, if you liked Seraphim Falls you will like this. Overall, started off slow but really picked up and by the end you are glad you watched it. One of the better westerns in the last few years. I give it a B.",N/A

Laughton is absolutely brilliant as Javert--and his performance is probably why I wanted my boys to see this version after they saw the musical.  Russell Crowe's Javert just didn't give the audience enough depth and explanation for his suicide, while Laughton's haunted performance makes it very clear.  I love having the two older versions, though the March/Laughton version is definitely the best.

40076,"It all depends on what you are looking for in a movie and your susceptibility level.  I'm an old movie fan and abhor the blatant fare provided today.  Some may call this hypocritical, and this film no doubt skims lightly over a very important moral issue.  However, in this case, I could just enjoy some of what I particularly enjoy from older movies -- beautiful houses, furniture, some of the English based to-do, clothes and all of that.  Old movies are particularly illusionary in providing this without the nasty realism of modern days that has a way of getting into your gut.  And please keep in mind that modern movies generally have the illicit lovers triumph, not what happens here.  The light touch is part of the appeal of the older ones. It's entertainment, always a bit of a fantasy.  I do know the difference between that and reality. Beautiful people in a beautiful setting involved in an absurd farce. If you really can't help being drawn off the straight and narrow by such a thing now and again, then by all means, be responsible to yourself and avoid.On another note, I remember hearing this was panned by critics at the time of release, so have kind of remembered it that way, though did enjoy the overall spectacle on a rerun a while back.  True, it was not the high water mark in acting for any of the performers.  But, going back to it now, it is still very entertaining and I am glad I have it to enjoy the strong production values and some of yesterday's stars in a glamor bit together.  Jolly good fun actually.  Best not taken too seriously.As far as the product goes, this was a used copy I took a risk on and it proved worth it.

1636667,"In the beginning, Steven Soderbergh's alleged swan song SIDE EFFECTS is an expose of medical ethics and pharmaceutical abuse.  However, it mutates into a quirky murder mystery that employs lots of twists and deceptions.  Further plot nuances would involve spoilers that other reviews have  already done so, so I'll just discuss my feelings on the film's impact.I enjoyed the movie overall---it held my interest and the acting is competent if unremarkable.  I'm not a huge fan of Jude Law but he comes across convincingly.  Rooney Mara who came on so strong in GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO seems like an upper scale Katie Holmes.  Catherine Zeta Jones who always looks good is somewhat miscast as Mara's first shrink and Channing Tatum has little to do as the hapless murder victim.Soderbergh's penchant for sharp characterization is diminished by tepid pacing and unexpected predictability.  SIDE EFFECTS is an okay but unmemorable experience.",N/A

1449811,"Being an owner of almost two dozen Blu Ray 3D movie releases purchased in past year  I was always enjoying  each and every one of them on my 106"" projector screen and Optoma HD83 gear and latest Optoma BG-ZF2100GLS glasses. The announcement of Hobbit - a ""masterpiece"" as called by many reviewers made me believe this is going to be even more breathtaking movie experience I have ever seen so far. Long preorder wait rewarded with disk set arrival was supposed to exceed my expectations - but it didn't.Right from the start, the first seconds of the movie made me think there is something wrong with my gear as 3D picture seemed to be crisp and clear as usual but unusually stereoscopic where instantly I noticed unnatural depth of field which made my eyes tired just after few minutes of watching. This is the same effect when short sided person gets the glasses with bad eye pupillary distance. To eliminate or confirm gear issue I replaced the disk with three other 3D movies I watched in the past: I Robot, Avatar and Prometheus. All three confirmed there is nothing wrong with the gear showing perfect picture as usual without any eye related discomfort.I put back the Hobbit disk and the problem came back. I had to actually change the viewing distance and get further away from the screen to the back wall of my projection room to make viewing acceptable. This is very unusual move because so far the distance from the screen never mattered and watching 3D movies from any distance or any angle was always enjoyable without any flaws or discomfort.I followed the observation path of unnatural depth of field, and I have noticed that the actual amount of L-R picture shift is dramatically different comparing to other three movies I mentioned above.  The easiest way to check it is to turn on subtitles and check the relative shift between L and R frame by looking at the subtitle letters with the 3D glasses not used. I noticed that on Hobbit the shift is far greater comparing to other movies and this made confirmed my observation about unusually large depth of field on entire picture which could cause my eyes discomfort.Despite of the above, with apprehension and viewing discomfort I managed to watch entire 3D movie to the end. But I was disappointed that the actual BD transfer is bad and causes my eyes tired for the first time I watch 3D movie. Among many others I own, this is the first one and probably the last one in the Hobbit series - at least in 3D version.I  took a time and played 2D version disk and the picture was perfect, natural although two-dimensional. This is going to be version I will probably enjoy with upcoming episodes of Tolkien Hobbit released on disk.I am just not sure how come director allowed releasing movie based on flawed transfer or authoring. The only explanation to this would be this was intentional. Not good for me, probably for some viewers either.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Still, the acting is superb, the Walters are the best, and Anna Torv is incomparable when impersonating the other-universe Olivia Dunham, which, by the way, it is a true human being when compared to our universe's Dunham. Jasika Nicole, in both universes, is great, but I love her character in our universe: intelligent, attentive, compassionate, and full of understanding.

I have personally witnessed a loved one die under similar circumstances, so the film and the acting and the characters were real to me -- too real for comfort, if anyone dare use a word like ""comfort"" in describing anything about this film. The portrayals were immediate and graphic. The action was deadly slow as would be the actual encounter with life and the immensely slow dying. The struggles of life and what lies ahead for all of us are unknown eventualities, but better to feel than to deny. The last desperate act of the male character is almost obscene unless one understands that he was filled with love. For the fainthearted, this is not a movie to watch.

320207,"I first caught this 1979 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's early classic ""The Lady Vanishes"" when I was a child. Even back then, I was a huge movie enthusiast and I found the experience to be pleasant, if not particularly substantial. It had its share of amusing moments, but it was not something that I wanted or needed to watch again. However, after a few decades and a lifetime of experience, I thought it might be worth giving this one a second look. The unlikely pair of Elliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd headline this piece, and it is quite fun to see them at a much different time in their careers. Note that I said ""fun,"" I did not say ""good."" Now I'm not a purist that contends that there can't be genuinely worthwhile remakes. There can. In fact, the relatively lightweight ""The Lady Vanishes"" seems an ideal candidate for an updating. Going for a distinctly different tone, however, the film underplays the mystery and the ambiguity to focus on over-the-top antics and manic characterizations. This may be to your liking or not. Personally, I found that when Gould and Shepherd played the entire film with such broad and big personas that it became genuinely tiresome. Though well made, the film falters with these lead performances that play to the rafters at every opportunity.Shepherd is a much married American heiress and Gould a skeptical magazine photographer. Although set in the thirties, you won't believe these two are anything but a product of the seventies! A partially inebriated Shepherd boards a train en route to London. She is given a helping hand from a kindly nanny (well played by Angela Lansbury). When she awakens, however, Lansbury is nowhere to be found and no one admits to having even seen her. Aided by Gould, she embarks on a mission to find out what is going on. Is everyone trying to cover up Lansbury's very existence? Or might she just have been a figment of Shepherd's imagination. As this version lacks mystery, the psychological angle is not very developed and falls a bit flatter than the original. They get added assistance from a kindly doctor played by great character actor Herbert Lom. As they push toward the truth, secrets are revealed and a danger escalates. The plotting is amusing enough, if not particularly believable, but many of the supporting players offer genuine humor.First, let me acknowledge that the movie looks great. The Austrian countryside is lovely and Shepherd's gown (she never has a costume change) is revealing. Lom is terrific as are many of the other actors that inhabit smaller parts. Lansbury makes a mark, but is seen all too briefly. The tone, as I mentioned, is lightweight with much of the action confined to the train. What all but derails the picture (I used a train metaphor) are those lead performances. Gould is hammy, but game enough. Trust me, this doesn't headline his resume! Shepherd really doesn't carry the picture well. Before her fans get in an uproar, let me tell you that I am a big Cybill Shepherd fan. Her line readings, though, are flat and off putting. When not sleepwalking, she overcompensates. I'm all for making this a funnier and lighter version, but the sight of Shepherd and Gould performing slapstick simply wears out its welcome. Interesting as a curiosity factor, but not something you'll want to revisit. KGHarris, 7/13.",N/A

BLOODLUST continues the SUBSPECIES vampire saga at its own leisurely pace, retracing many of the same plot points from the previous films but with far less success. It isn't without its moments, however. Michele's first attempt to lure her prey using her new-found powers is highly atmospheric and brilliantly shot using only the most basic editing techniques as effectively as possible. The contrast between Denise Duff's pale beauty and Anders Hove's sinister, rat-like appearance set against their dark surroundings also makes for a number of striking images.

51864,"After building up the duo's popularity through recordings and several performances on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd as ""legendary"" Chicago blues brothers(Jake and Elwood Blues)--took their act to the big screen in this action-packed hit from mid 1980.As Jake and Elwood struggle to reunite their old band and save the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they wreak enough good-natured havoc to attract the entire Cook County police force. The result is a big-budget stunt-fest on a scale rarely attempted before or since, including extended car chases that result in the wanton destruction of shopping malls and more police cars than you can count.Along the way there's plenty of music to punctuate the action, including performances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown that are guaranteed to knock you out. As played with deadpan wit by Belushi and Aykroyd, the Blues Bros. are ""On A Mission From God,"" and that gives them a kind of reckless glee that keeps the movie from losing its comedic appeal.Otherwise this might have been just a bloated marathon of mayhem that quickly wears out its welcome (which is how some critics described this film and its 1998 sequel). Keep an eye out for Steven Spielberg as the city clerk who stamps some crucial paperwork near the end of the film.THE BLUES BROS. also amassed 115,229, 890 at the Box office in the Summer of 1980, but production was delayed when filming began in the Summer of 1979, due to John Belushi's serious drug abuse which only continued to worsen, plus Aykroyd & Belushi left SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at the end of the previous season, especially since Belushi's fame & reputation was going down the toilet at the end of 1979.This musical comedy flick also had notable singers like*John Lee Hooker as musician on Maxwell Street and non-musical supporting cast such as*Director(John Landis)as State Trooper*John Candy as Det.

1532098,"With some fine writing and directing for the occasion, Downey and Company give us  a second feast of a Holmes for the contemporary viewer. It should be added that this in no way overshadows the notable Basil Rathbone series of my generation ( I was already a regular movie-goer when Rathbone and Bruce took over the franchise assisted in the first production by Ida Lupino, among others.  The big difference to date in comparing them is that after the second or third production, the older series was shifted to ""B"" film status and no longer had first rate directors, writers or actors, aside from R&B.; At any rate, this is a very different Holmes and has earned the right to be judged on its own merits, in terms of which, I think, it gets credit for a changed Holmesian character without, in any way, undermining the Holmes of the century and some odd decades preceding it. The most recent major Holmes presence, the late Jeremy Brett in an outstanding BBC series ended with his death, shows that the traditional characterizations can co-exist with serious contemporary efforts. ( One might enjoy the comic or psychiatric utilization of the Holmes ethos, but those have no impact on the main traditions.)Robert Downey, Jr.  remains the acting spark which vitalizes the entire quite well-chosen cast. It is quite a  pleasure to see him in action.

With a lot of movies I watch, I find myself stopping and starting the DVD every once in awhile as I get distracted by something else. So, for me to watch a movie from start to finish without interruptions is a rarity. This was one of those movies.The plot is solid and believable, the dialogue is solid and believable, the characters are (for the most part) solid and believable, and the acting is strong from start to finish. Again, definitely ""worth a look.""No real weaknesses anywhere, which sounds like ""faint praise,"" but really isn't, because so many movies these days have glaring weaknesses.

A group of xenophobic ""red necks"" lead by Josiah (Phil Perry) want to cleanse America and start breeding their own kind. They kidnap Cora (Annie Thurman) for the cause. Her father Mike (David Eby) and grandfather Frank (Ron Berryessa) seek the group out so they can rescue her. There is also a nice guy walking around named Noah (Luke Hatmaker) who adds a gf (Olivia Bishop) and there is a kid who has been bit that should figure into the main plot, but doesn't.This film was originally released in 2011 under the title ""Falls the Shadow."" With the release of World War Z, they apparently added the ""Zombie Warz"" as a way to capitalize on the success of the blockbuster.The film didn't have a lot of zombies and lacked special effects. It was shot on a budget. Writer/director Steven Berryessa apparently couldn't afford actors so he employed his family. Ron Berryessa, who had a speaking role, was noticeably  bad, but was clearly out shined by the ridiculous purse lipped David Eby.

We watched it last night.It is basically a version of Casa Blanca set in Martinique, but not as good.

Somehow they hook up.Walter Brennan does a good job playing a drunk that Bogart gives booze money to as his hired hand on the boat. He never seems to do anything but drink.Bogart needs money so he reluctantly agrees to some goofy scheme to help transport a Free French refugee.The story line is pretty far fetched. It is mostly just a vehicle for the two stars to do their thing, and they do it well.I find the constant cigarette smoking annoying. Never have liked that filthy habit. But that is something that is just there in every movie made up until a few decades ago.

515348,"Inspired by Sergio Leone's ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, another Italian Sergio (Corbucci) keeps the genre popular worldwide with this violent but fun film.  Starring a young (23) blue-eyed stud with a shortened name of Franco Nero, the movie is pretty simple and follows the Leone formula.Django (Nero) walks throughout the film dragging a coffin behind him using an attached rope.  We don't know what happened to his normal transportation.  Filmed in Italy and Spain, the setting is the U. S. /Mexican border just after the Civil War.  Django is a former Union soldier (still wears the yellow striped pants) headed for a small town on the Mexican side.  Along the way he finds a woman who is being beaten by a handful of Mexicans.  After dispatching them quickly with his six-shooter, another group of horsemen arrive.  These are Americans but wear red scarves or hoods, suggesting an element of the Klan.  They suffer a fate similar to the Mexicans.Django takes Maria (Loredana Nusciak) with him into town.  Django's goal is to avenge his wife who died at the hand of one of the equally evil group of bad guys.  Either the Mexican revolutionaries led by Gen. Rodriguez (Jose Bodalo) or more likely, the red KKK dudes and their leader Maj. Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo).  Jackson is so evil that he dispatches young Mexicans one at a time to run up a hill, before shooting them with his rifle as target practice.  While Django is adept with his handgun, he only has one and it only has six bullets.  So to everyone's surprise he invites Jackson to bring his 40 member gang into town for a final shootout.  Naturally Django has a surprise waiting.Corbucci who wrote the story as well as directed the film, is brutal with his confrontations.  Kids are killed, ears are severed and hands are crushed along with the unusually severe beatings.  Keeping with the times of 1966, it's not overly gory, but would surely earn an ""R"" rating, even today.  The film has plenty of logic-distancing scenes as well as some continuity issues.  And there are some noticeable blunders that might leaving one shaking their head.  Still, considering the budget and the scope, ""Django"" is a film worth seeing if you are a Western film aficionado.  ""Django"" continued on with several sequels and was fondly remembered by filmmaker Quinton Tarantino as evidenced by his 2012 film ""Django Unchained"" which featured a brief cameo by Nero.The Blu ray adaptation has some problems but is overall well done.  The film begins with an optional introduction by Nero and the following disclaimer: The print used was ""transferred from its original camera negative, which contained some intermittent age-related damage.""  And yes, it's pretty evident.  There are a couple incidents of a pause between scenes.  In other cases, the picture fluctuates from scene to scene.  There is some unusually heavy grain in evidence in some frames.  Having said all that, at least they told us.  And in reality, most of the film looks very good.  Excellent color, good detail and contrast.I wasn't exactly thrilled with the audio either.  We get two DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (1.0) tracks.  One is in the original Italian with English subtitles.  The other is an English dubbed version.  I watched the dubbed version for a few minutes but didn't like Nero's voice actor.  It also seemed like the translation didn't always make sense.  This was verified when I went over to the Italian and the subtitles were in fact different.  Neither audio version is all that strong in either case.  The film begs for a more immersive track.  Subtitles include English, English SDH, French and Spanish.Extras include an interview with Nero and asst. director Ruggero Deodato, a 10 minute film starring Nero called  'The Last Pistolero.'  There is also a 1968 documentary featuring several filmmakers about the ""Spaghetti Western Phenomenon.""",Django VHS

Belushi and Aykroyd live and breathe the roles of Jake and Elwood, the buttoned-down, stern-faced suits who suddenly explode when the stage lights fire up, characters who seemed instantly destined to transcend the spectacle of their own story. Their plot is, really, embarrassingly simple - regroup the band, put on a big show, save the orphanage - but the strength of the brothers, the ad-lib mastery of their vessels and a staggering wealth of guest appearances mold it into a behemoth that's barely able to squeeze into a comfortable running time. It may seem random, zany and baffling at times, but it's impossible to look away and eventually everything comes together in a loud, reckless, picture-perfect finale.

Pastor Ethan (of The Second Chance Church's central church branch) isn't easy to get along with, whatwith his clicheing mind and how he thinks Pastor Jake handles the ruffians of his neighborhood. And by ruffians, I mean the drug dealers who deal out drugs in broad daylight in front of kids, with kids, and show blatant disrespect to anyone who shows they can handle their own against them. What they don't expect is the pastor that can take them down, especially when he reveals that he, too, has a past.There are a few people who hate this movie and say it's not a ""Christian"" movie, and the producers said they didn't want to label it as such. Why? Nothing about the language (compared to Hollywood, this is rather tame), but because it doesn't deal with conversions (like most Christians seem to expect) or an apocalyptic film (that seems cliched to do, but they do still do it), but because it deals with redemption with people from different backgrounds.For an independently made (and small-budgeted) film, this does pretty good compared to other indie flicks I've seen (and wish I hadn't), especially in the Christian realm. As such, the acting is good (especially with Jeff Carr's attitude), the camera style subliminal in its presentation, the humor (though somewhat sparse) is refreshing when it's needed. The poignancy shows real-life grit without delving into R-rated junk (always appreciated). It's too bad there are Christians who miss the needed message for what they perceive as an ""unChristian"" ""Hollywood"" flick.This movie is primarily about getting a second chance in life when everyone around you won't bother giving you one.Hopefully there will be more movies with Jeff Carr in it if he can keep acting so brilliantly.",The Second Chance

1375786,"A few fine performances here, especially Kelly McDonald. Problem is the main character isn't believable or attractive in any way. I like Buscemi, but let's face it, he's a fairly one dimensional actor as he's been recreating Mr. Pink since Reservoir Dogs. I just don't buy this skinny, chain-smoking twerp being a powerful crime boss with his choice of all the best looking women.I've continued to watch but I nearly gave up after the first 2-3 episodes as it appeared to be just another period-piece fashion show full of unattractive characters. Another reason I nearly gave up on the show was the music. OK, we get it, it's 1920. Good God, back off. It is a very cheap & annoying method of conveying the time period of any movie to simply play period music underneath scene after scene, music that has no connection to what's on screen. In 1920, there were no radios or radios stations. And Victrolas were not exactly common. So why does there always seem to be an Al Jolson song playing from the next room in every scene?And the smoking! Buscemi would fall flat if he didn't have his cigarette smoking to fall back on as a prop. He obviously went to the Michael Madsen &#34;cigarette-smoking-as-acting&#34; school. Add the ever-present whiskey glass and you have cheap, tiresome &#34;acting&#34; tools for everyone to use in scene after scene. It's boring. And all the clever stories told by these gangsters every time they have to make a point? Most of these criminals of the time were uneducated cretins who could hardly put a sentence together let alone a wordy story full of colorful meatphors and the ultimate clever point. These were sociopaths and psychopaths, not Walt Whitman or Hawthorne.What ultimately made The Sopranos so special was the lead character, Tony Soprano. It sounds odd, but Tony Soprano is a psychopath I find funny and likable along with his murderous tendencies. As the lead character in Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson exhibits very little that is likable. As TV psychopaths go, he is simply a mean,  insufferable jerk playing dress-up while he smokes and drinks constantly.And the best actor in the entire series, Michael Shannon, is wasted, IMO, with this bizarre Van Alden character.  At some point, for me anyway, in any film or series, there must be a character to like or admire on some level. This series provides no one of that description.",N/A

424311,"4 1/2 starsWonder Bar is one of the very last ""hurrahs"" for pre-Code Hollywood; the restrictive Hayes Production Code went into effect very shortly after this film was released. The often not so honorable action moves swiftly but the musical numbers are never rushed; Busby Berkeley's use of mirrors and extremely thoughtful use of lighting to accentuate even the tiniest of details impressed me greatly! For example, the way they used light to accentuate even the eyelashes on the beautiful blondes singing in one musical number shows such care about detail and I admire that. And although much of the film has ""naughty"" or much darker plot elements to it including murder, I also found it both interesting and soothing to see escapist fare such as the sequence in which the gentleman seeks out the lady whose shoe will fit her, as if she's a magical fairy-tale type of Cinderella--what a juxtaposition of themes there is in this film! In addition, Al Jolson's performances are wonderful although the ""minstrel show"" sequence is very embarrassingly dated (ouch).I also couldn't help but notice certain things about ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule"" in which Jolson's minstrel character ascends to a brighter, much better lit heaven from a darker world. This ascent to a brighter heaven seems, albeit in a much, much cruder way because of the stereotyping, similar to Dorothy from ""The Wizard of Oz"" entering Munchkinland and later Oz after she leaves her sepia toned house from Kansas. Indeed, Jolson's character enters heaven after knocking on a door and being let in by a guard who at first peers at them through an opening in the door precisely the way Dorothy and her friends are allowed into Oz to see the Wizard, which in this case could be seen as Saint Peter. And just like Dorothy (and her friends) gets a fine reception in Oz when they first arrive there, Jolson's character is warmly received by Saint Peter and the others.The action itself all takes place in just one night at Al Wonder's (Al Jolson's) Wonder Bar in Paris; and there's certainly more than just one angle to the more concrete aspects of the plot! Inez (Dolores del Rio) and Harry (Ricardo Cortez) are a dance act at Wonder Bar; but things aren't going so smoothly. Inez loves Harry but Harry loves Liane (Kay Francis) who can't stand being married to Mr. R.H. Renaud (Henry Kolker); Liane wants Harry for herself and even more than that Liane wants to run away to America with Harry that night using money they obtained in a not so legitimate way. This leads to many complications just in that one night! We also see what happens when Al himself wants Inez to be his girlfriend; this leads to some surprises, too. There's also Captain Hugo Von Ferring (Robert Barrat) who people kinda-sorta try to prevent from harming himself, although just as the film industry was kissing goodbye to the pre-Code halcyon days the characters who benefit from Captain Ferring's generosity just can't stop indulging themselves for what could well be the last time, taking his money and more all the while ignoring the probable demise of the Captain much like the filmmakers were indulging themselves perhaps just one last time before the Hayes Code would be enforced. We even see the supposedly reserved older crowd fooling around as fast as they can behind their spouses' backs; watch for great performances from Hugh Herbert as Pratt and Guy Kibbee as Simpson with their wives played by Louise Fazenda and Ruth Donnelly. Add to that the young conductor Tommy (Dick Powell) who has his own eyes on someone at the Wonder Bar and you've got a really powerful plot going on!The DVD doesn't come with any extras and that's unfortunate. I would have liked something more to watch but the film itself remains one of the better Hollywood pre-Code movies.Wonder Bar is a must-have film for fans of the actors in it and people who appreciate pre-Code Hollywood films with musical numbers will not be disappointed. True, there are incredibly embarrassing stereotypes of African-Americans especially in the ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule"" number but as others have noted we shouldn't delete this to pretend these prejudices never existed. I also agree with the reviewer who writes that considering some of the darker aspects of the plot and the subplots ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule"" doesn't make the picture all that much more ""indelicate"" than it already is!",Wonder Bar VHS

729939,"I love the Empires series (especially the one on Ben Franklin) and I'm a sucker for history programs but this one left a rotten taste in my mouth. Yes, Martin Luther is a fascinating and complex historical figure who challenged corruption, contributed to the Enlightenment, and made a substantial, positive impact on the world. The main and absolutely inexcusable problem here, though, is that in a documentary of an hour and forty-seven minutes, they spent less than one minute addressing the fact that Luther also repeatedly and in no uncertain terms recommended violence against Jews and is arguably the forefather of German anti-Semitism.I am stunned that the Luther-loving ""experts"" completely ignored that ugly fact until a mere thirty seconds tossed into the last ten minutes of the film. I also noticed that the expert who mentioned it was shown just minutes later calling Luther one of the greatest ""emancipators"" of all time. Perhaps. But overall, the editing and interviews in this documentary horribly whitewash Luther's flaws and generally portrays him as compassionate but severe, when the truth (as is often the case) is far more complex and deserving of attention.This documentary needed a Roman Catholic rebuttal (as other reviewers have said) and maybe, I dunno, at least one or two of the other Luther-lovers acknowledging the fact that, yes, the guy also encouraged his followers to burn down synagogues. As it is, I half expect the makers of this documentary to do another project on the conquistadors or Christopher Columbus that focusing on their bravery and makes only a passing mention of genocide right.before the credits roll.Ha, sorry to get off on a rant but as a rule, I hate historical.whitewashing.",N/A

That's where Robert Osbourne must get his leadins/outs for TCM.  Most of the reviews I've read here focus on the technical aspects of the film itself, and that's fine.  I don't know much about those things.  I'll assume everyone is familiar with the basic storyline, so I'll not belabor the details.What I take exception to is my man Roger Ebert's much-later assessment that Mrs. Robinson deserved more sympathy and that Ben was ""an insufferable creep.""  He's wrong.  This not a story about a young man's affair with an older woman.  It's about social pressure and the devestating effects it can have on the young -- Ben and Elaine and even Mrs. Robinson herself when she was their age.  I saw The Graduate at the theater, first run.  I was twenty years-old myself, and at the time just saw it as an hilarious comedy.  Forty-five years later it looks altogether different.  If Ben is creepy, it may well have been caused by they creepy things going on around him.  On the edge anyway, the actions of Mrs. Robinson pushed him over.  Indeed, in the beginning he is a basically sincere and honorable young man.  He's led astray by a woman old enough to know better and caught up in her own narcicism.  She deliberatly sets out to destroy him because he represents the promise that had once elluded her.  When he later determines to fullfill it with her own daughter, she comes completely unglued.The ending is somewhat ambiguous.  You'd like to think that things get sorted out for Ben and Elaine and that they live happily ever after.  But you know life ain't that simple and that they're off to a shaky start.  It's clear, however, that Ben is a better man than Elaine's husband, Carl, who is revealed to be the real creep and with whom she could not have had a good life.  The potential, if not the promise, of a happy ending resolves the story about as well as it could have.The Graduate is worth watching every few years for a lifetime . . .",The Graduate

Afterall, the main events that happen may be serious but some of the smaller events can seem quite funny.  The music definitely gives it a more light-hearted feel.

They both are story-driven, character-etched well-photographed mid-century studies of man caught in the undertow of crime featuring shared co-leads, Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell, young lovers on the run attempting to create their own world away from responsibility in rural midwest. But in ""Side Street"" Farley Granger's character makes a wrong choice that begins a hunt for the real criminals before the law catches up with him in the confining big city. ""They Live By Night"" will remind you of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" superficially, where violent gunplay was nearly co-star, whereas here the off-setting driving force is the growing genuine love of Granger for O'Donnell that plays in opposition to the violent, hardened ex-cons like the one-eyed leader.(Howard Da Silva,(of ""David and Lisa"")It is this innocent love bond that grows while the law envelops the two that ultimately breaks your heart at the climax with one of the most touching fade-outs in cinema, more touching than the closing words in ""The Grapes of Wrath."" In Mann's ""Side Street"" from the start the urban skyscraper habitat of New York appears to oppress Granger's scrounging, post-war character. With a master cameraman's work, every character has an edginess to them. Granger makes a weak choice and it costs him his anonymity and innocence. The chase begins, the hoods are after him and so is the law with his innocent bride in the hospital,(he does explain tenderly his predicament, making a couple desperate hospital visits) until the climax. The camera work moves the action swiftly. It contains more surprises than most Saturday afternoon movies. Granger must rise above his resources to prove his innocence, yet confront the hardened hoodlums (a corrupt attorney for one)time and again to regain his self-respect. You are certain he does that by the time he is forced at gunpoint to drive a thug away from the reaches of law through lower Manhattan at sunrise. Granger ends the chase of pursuing cop cars suddenly swerving his car to a crash and encircling pistol fire.

592169,"When crafting a film like ""John Q."", it would have been simple for director Nick Cassavetes to go the ""simple route"" and turn it into a simple hostage flick.  Luckily for viewers, though, Cassavetes instead creates an incredibly nuanced movie that is casted about as perfectly as any film ever made.For a basic plot summary, ""John Q."" tells the story of John Archibald (Denzel Washington) and wife Denise (Kimberly Elise), who see their son Mikey (Daniel E. Smith) collapse at a Little League and require a new heart to live for much longer.  The problem?  The Archibalds do not have good enough insurance to cover the procedure, leading John to take matters into his own hands.This is one of my favorite movies of all-time because of its many nuances.  The themes are very thought-provoking and very ""grey""...no ""black and white"" heroes and villains here.  As in real life, there are always other agendas that must be pieced together and reckoned with in order to understand any situation.  The same goes for this movie.  Is John the hero or the villain?  It all depends on how you look at it.  I love (and respect) films that are able to both entertain me and make me think about how the events on the screen relate to my own life.It only helps that this is perhaps the most perfectly-casted film in cinema history!  Denzel is, of course, custom-made for his role, while auxiliary players like James Woods, Anne Heche, Ray Liotta, & Robert Duvall couldn't be better in the roles they play.Overall, ""John Q."" is a film that may just speak to you on a number of different levels (societal, personal, etc.).  It also contains enough drama, action, and humor to be a well-rounded experience.  If you are a fan of Denzel's work at all, or even just movies that will make you think, then this one should not be missed.",N/A

Clear, with no hiccups.The movie itself....Some have said that this was a 'Coming of age' kind of storyline, that it was more about the boy and his difficult life, than the man named Mud. Yes, the film did focus on the boy more, but it equally focused on Mud and his hard life. The acting was superb. The cinematography was at times beautiful, as well as dark and gritty. The soundtrack was very, very subtle, allowing the viewer to hear the surroundings, making it even more realistic. For parents and those concerned about the rating: There are no nude scenes. No sex scenes. Yet there is a boat-load of foul language. No 'F' bomb that I heard, yet within the first 10 minutes of the film I counted 9 'S' words alone; after counting to 15 I stopped keeping track, and a slew of other foul words just kept on from there. It was just too much foul language, and really not needed. Also quite a bit of gun violence, with people being shot at close range. Boys fighting each other, a grown man punching a boy in the face. Sex references, including porn magazines, and references to girls breasts.Spoiler Alert....For me this movie can be summed up in one word, tragic. No happy endings here. Ellis the boy ends up with the life he didn't want. His father ends up with the life he didn't want. When you start to care about Mud, you then learn that his trials were all for nothing and in the end he doesn't learn a thing. You are lead to care about Mud's girlfriend Juniper, only to dislike her later. The characters seem to be thrown together at which point they all experience tragedies and hard times, then they all sort of go their own way, and life goes on with no one really happy (or caring) about anything. Two hours of unhappiness, dirt, violence, and foul language.",N/A

1026387,"MGM was famous for family fare, glossy dramas, and intelligent musicals--but during the 1930s horror films were all the rage, so it is no surprise the studio took an occasional crack at the genre.  The result was seldom memorable, but along the way the studio did manage to generate at least three minor classics, each of them remarkably notorious in their day: FREAKS, MAD LOVE, and the 1932 THE MASK OF FU MANCHU.Based on the characters created by novelist Sax Rohmer, Dr. Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) has determined to consolidate all the powers of Asia by obtaining the mask and sword of legendary Genghis Kahn.  He is assisted in this by his daughter Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy), and indeed it is hard to know which is more depraved.  When an English expedition actually obtains the mask and sword, Fu Manchu and his daughter resort to torture to obtain the items--and the tortures are memorable indeed, ranging from an endlessly tolling bell to a crocodile pit to moving walls of silver knives.  Perhaps the single most disturbing torture sequences involve the handsome young expedition member Terry (Charles Starrett.)  He is first stripped half naked, hung by his hands from the ceiling, and viciously whipped while Fah Lo See screams ""Faster!  Faster!""  Later he is reduced to a loin cloth, secured to a table by clamps, and wiggles in an effort to escape as he is pawed by Fu Manchu.By all accounts the production of THE MASK OF FU MANCHU was shambles, and the resulting film is uneven, but frankly pre-code films of the early 1930s just don't get any more kinkier or any less politically incorrect than this one, and the frequently cut scenes and bits of dialogue have been restored.  ""Kill the white man and take his women!"" Fu Manchu shouts to his leering Mongol horde.  The DVD has the bonus of a particularly interesting audio commentary by film historian Greg Mank, who notes that Karloff seemed to regard the film as a lark and Loy described the script as ""obscene.""And then there is THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, a 1935 made when censorship was in full force.  In some respects it is an interesting film.  It based on the ""lost"" Lon Chaney film LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT, and inasmuch as both were created by the same director, Todd Browning, it gives us a notion of what the Chaney film might have been like.  The film also has several interesting performances, particularly two largely silent performances by Bela Lugosi as Count Mora and Carroll Borland as Luna, and it further developes the ""Dracula"" imagery in a number of remarkable ways, most particularly in terms of how Luna is presented.Unfortunately, the script is so ridiculously uneven that it becomes difficult to follow the story line.  Essentially, several years earlier Sir Karell Borotyn (Holmes Herbert) was mysteriously murdered, two fang marks found on his throat.  Now that his daughter  Irena (Elizabeth Allan) is about to be married, equally dangerous forces seem to be gathering around her in the form of Count Mora and his daughter Luna.  Fortunately, Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore) arrives on the scene, ready to battle the undead.  But can he?  And are they?  What exactly IS going here?  As Dorothy Parker so infamously said on a different occasion, ""There's less here than meets the eye,"" and the end result is singularly unspectacular.  Fortunately, THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE is at least entertaining in a visual sense, and it also has a memorable audio commentary by historians Kim Newman and Steve Jones.THE MASK OF FU MANCHU is probably a must-have for fans of 1930s horror, THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE not so much.  Even so, both are worth watching, with FU MANCHU the clear winner when it comes to jaw-dropping viciousness and kink.  Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Mark of the Vampire & The Mask of Fu Manchu

1553799,"Now, before you get all excited, yes this is a concert from the Kinks from 1965 like the title implies. Every other thing that could go wrong with this title pretty much does, so beware. There are quite a few other Kinks titles on DVD, and I would collect those before picking up this one. This title would be for the diehard collector, or completists only.This is a fullscreen black and white presentation with a pretty awful picture, with lots of pixilation. The audio is in mono, and the vocals (And sometimes the crowd noise) are mixed way up front. Considering the age of the concert though, it's probably lucky that the source survives at all. Sometimes the vocals don't match up with the singers lips on screen, but again, that's probably going to happen with an almost fifty year old concert film. There are no bonus features on the disc at all, and probably most disappointing is the fact that the whole DVD runs only twenty minutes. So, like I said before, this should be for collectors and completists only. Let's find out about the Kinks up to this 1965 show, and then I'll give the DVD tracklisting.WikipediaThe Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Ray and Dave Davies in 1964. Categorised in the United States as a British Invasion band, the Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Original members Pete Quaife (bass guitar, vocals) and Mick Avory (drums and percussion) were replaced by John Dalton in 1969 and Bob Henrit in 1984, respectively. Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band during studio sessions in the mid-1960s. Later, various keyboardists, including John Gosling and Ian Gibbons, were full-time members.The Kinks first came to prominence in 1964 with their third single, ""You Really Got Me"", written by Ray Davies. It became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.The Kinks' first single was a cover of the Little Richard song ""Long Tall Sally"". Bobby Graham, a friend of the band, was recruited to play drums on the recording. He would continue to occasionally substitute for Avory in the studio and play on several of the Kinks' early singles. ""Long Tall Sally"" was released in February 1964, but despite the publicity efforts of the band's managers, the single was almost completely ignored. When their second single, ""You Still Want Me"", failed to chart,Pye Records threatened to annul the group's contract unless their third single was successful.""You Really Got Me"" was released in August 1964, and, boosted by a performance on the television show Ready Steady Go!, quickly reached number one in the United Kingdom. Hastily imported by the American label Reprise Records, it also made the Top 10 in the United States.The loud, distorted guitar riff-achieved by a slice Dave Davies made in the speaker cone of his Elpico amplifier (referred to by the band as the ""little green amp"")-gave the song its signature, gritty guitar sound.Extremely influential on the American garage rock scene, ""You Really Got Me"" has been described as ""a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal"". Soon after its release, the group recorded most of the tracks for their debut LP, simply titled Kinks. Consisting largely of covers and revamped traditional songs, it was released on 2 October 1964, reaching number four on the UK chart.The group's fourth single, ""All Day and All of the Night"", another original hard rock tune, was released three weeks later, reaching number two in the United Kingdom,and number seven in the United States./WikipediaThe track list on the DVD are as follows:1.Bye Bye Johnny2.Louie Louie3.You Really Got Me4.Got Love If You Want It5.Long Tall Shorty (Cuts off near end)6.All Day And All Of The Night (Missing the first half of the song)7.You Really Got Me8.All AboardOnce again, this may be a hard to find show, but the shoddy presentation, lack of extras, and terrible picture quality leave this release in strictly collectors territory. 5/10.",N/A

I think this set is a great price, The best movies being Godzilla, Ghidorah, Godzilla vs Mothra and The Invasion of Astro Monster. Godzilla Raids again was okay. I liked it enough to buy the set. I didn't like Terror of Mechagodzilla or All Monsters Attack. Ghidorah and Invasion have a lot of monsters in them like Rodan, Mothra and Ghidorah. Those were always my favorite as a kid. Both versions of Godzilla are great but the Japanese version is superior. It's a masterpiece of cinema but dark in it's serious tone and message. Godzilla Raids Again had Godzilla fighting another monster he would later team up with. Godzilla vs Mothra has Godzilla as the bad guy again. I wish Godzilla vs Gigan and Godzilla vs Hedorah were on here but you can find them reasonably priced at FYE as online they are expensive. I also recommend Destroy All Monsters.

1600938,"This film is based on a true story, and it certainly is easy to forget that the events are simply a dramatisation of actual criminal events that occurred throughout the United States in recent decades. The performances are so poignant and authentic that it is easy to lose oneself in the stream of events. The tension and pacing is nearly flawless, and there are no slow or dull portions within the film.The premise of the film (and crimes) is simple: call a fast food joint during the week's busiest day, present yourself as an upstanding member of law enforcement, and accuse an entry-level employee of theft. The rest writes itself as the demands escalate beyond what one could reasonably accept as procedure (isolating the suspect and searching their belongings).Where did the criminals come up with such schemes? Most likely the experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s to test how far ordinary people will go when instructed to hurt people (the ""victims"" of this study were confederates who merely acted out the effects of electrocution). In most circumstances, under the guidance of a ""trustworthy"" authority figure, over 60% of experimentees showed they were willing to inflict fatal shocks to their victims. Unsurprisingly, being under orders allows one to distance themselves from the deed and resulting consequences.",N/A

657764,"War(released Aug/07)stars actioners Jet Li as Rogue,Jason Statham as Crawford,along with John Lone as Chang,Devon Aoki as Kira,Luis Guzm&aacute;n as Benny,Saul Rubinek as Dr. Sherman,Ryo Ishibashi asShiro,Sung Kang as Goi,Mathew St. Patrick as Wick,among others.This is a straight up violent melee' with a twist ending.Although the plot is a been-there,done-that scenario,director Ellis handles his chores with a deft touch,along with the nice editing and a driving musical score.The story finds us in San Fran.There are two crime bosses,one Yakuza,Shiro,who has never stepped foot on U.S.soil but has underlings working there for him and controlling his interests.The second group is a Chinese Triad gang run by Chang.The Yakuza has slowly been encroaching upon his turf for years,which has dried up his liquid assets.Shiro is shipping a couple of priceless gold statues to the U.S.to sell on the black market and Chang intends to get them for himself.The money he obtains from their sale will more than put he and his empire on a better footing.Entering this picture comes Crawford and Tom Lone,as two FBI partners.They take part in a bust of a Yakuza operation and a special hit man called the Rogue is shot in the incident.The Yakuza want revenge so they let the Rogue loose who &#34;kills&#34; Lone,his wife and child and sets the house on fire.Crawford is beside himself with grief,but revenge soon enters his heart.In the meantime we are privy to the Rogues disposition.That being he likes to think of himself as masterless,accountable to no one.With that mind set he has a penchant for working for one side while playing the other against itself.As Crawford seeks out the Rogue,who leaves a signature titanium shell casing at every crime scene,the Rogue is busy stirring up the Triads and/or the Yakuza.The Rogue,as the shipment of special statues arrive from Japan,is &#34;working&#34; for Chang,to secure them for him.This he accomplishes with relative ease.In the meantime Crawford finds the last of three remaining independent plastic surgeons who worked on the Rogues face,hiding in Mexico.He identifies a picture Crawford shows him of the Rogue.On the way out of the building the doctor goes down.Back in the U.S.the Rogue finally meets Shiro,who has come to personally supervise the statues arrival.It seems the Rogue has been working for him all along.The Rogue delivers the stolen statues back to his boss,but his boss has been tipped off that the Rogue didn`t kill Chang`s wife and daughter as ordered.Shiro now wants the Rogue dead for disobedience.A battle royale ensues with everyone eliminated but the Rogue and Shiro,who then proceed to match swords.When asked by Shiro why he has turned on him,the Rogue says he ordered one hit too many...on his wife and daughter.In a flashback we see that Crawford`s partner,the day of the hit,did NOT die as we first thought.The Rogue was actually killed that day by Lone.To get revenge Lone had his own face altered and pretended to be the Rogue from then on,playing everyone off each other until he could get to Shiro.Shiro,just before he dies,informs Lone/Rogue,that his partner knew about the upcoming hit on his family.Lone sets up a face to face meeting with his old partner Crawford at a pier.An FBI sniper is hidden above to take the Rogue down.The two end up tussling and the truth comes out.Lone outs himself while Crawford reveals he indeed did know of the upcoming visit by the Rogue,but it was supposed to be just a rough up,not a murder.Crawford asks for Lone`s forgiveness.Just as the sniper is about to fire,Crawford steps into his line of sight and Lone shoots Crawford in the back and flees.The movie ends as Lone,now the Rogue,flees across the Golden Gate bridge.The film moves along at quite a good clip and the action,when it comes,comes fast and furious.Both Statham and Li are in fine form fighting in each of their trademark styles.The film is directed very nicely and where others movies can often lose the viewer with such back and forth storyline changes,this one seems to be able to generally keep us in the loop consistently through plot and visual cues.There are many good and well known Asian actors present also,in the form of the crime bosses and their underlings,and they all do a terrific job.Watch for Canadian actor Saul Rubinek as the doctor and a nice part done by Luis Guzman,who plays his part with a calm and straightforward touch.He`s usually playing some off beat weirdo scumbag,so it was nice to see him in this kind of role for a change.Technically speaking the film is in its w/ a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras abound here with several commentaries,deleted scenes,a gag reel and featurettes.All in all a nicely done cops versus crime gangs in San Francisco.Li and Statham are in fine form as the two former FBI mates that end up on opposite sides...with a twist.3 1/2-4 stars,and I`m leaning towards the 4th on this one.",War

Lain and her friends receive postmortem e-mails from her saying that she has merely left her body and now lives within the ""Wired"". The Wired is an evolved form of the internet. Lain is intrigued by this event and begins to explore The Wired.When she gets involved with The Wired, Lain discovers that it is more than just a network of electrical signals. It is more like a living thing. A living thing with a will. Is it god? Is it an alternate Universe? Who the hell knows? I think it may be all of those. Lain discovers the truth behind her existence, the existence of the Wired, and their relationship to the real world.This anime all all kinds of weird. It's older, so the animation is kinda odd. It's from the creator of Haibane Renmei; and it's obvious from the character designs. I had to try very hard to get through the first 5 episodes. It bored me to death and made me angry. Once things began to unfold, I started to appreciate it. This is one of those artsy/experimental shows. It's totally philosophical ans psychological. There is not much action or drama. It moves painfully slow. Most of the characters are very one dimensional and have no personality. Lain and here family are especially boring people.The psychological elements of this story are the main focus. The characters teeter back and forth on the frayed edges of sanity. What is real? What is not? What is the truth? These things drive the characters to the edge. It takes a toll on your brain as you watch the characters explore their world. The animation and soundtrack also gnaw at your patience. There is a lot of static and ""white noise"" going through the speakers.I respect this series for it's depth and creativity, but I just don't like it. The story is deep and thought provoking, the animation is unique, but it's a major chore to watch. If I rated it according to how much enjoyment I got out of it; I would give it 2 stars. That isn't a fair rating though. If I'm trying to be objective, I'll give it 4 stars. It is a long shot from 5 stars, but it is a great piece of art and storytelling. There is nothing to get attached to in this series, so it's hard to fall in love with it. If you remember the ending of the Evangelion TV series; where the characters pretty much get a psyche evaluation, you can get a relative idea of what this anime is like. It's like watching the final Evangelion episode for 5 hours. I can't recommend buying this anime without watching it first. If you're interested in it, most definitely watch it online or rent it first. I bought it before I saw it, based on all the 5 star reviews. It pisses me off that everyone raved about something that was so subjective. I really wish I had watched it before buying. I can't stress it enough: WATCH BEFORE YOU BUY. YOU MAY LOVE IT, YOU MAY HATE IT.Review of the product:This is an excellent release(5 stars). It comes with both Blu-ray and DVD versions in separate cases. The box is very sturdy and has beautiful artwork. There is a small booklet inside with commentary for each episode. There is also a really big art book inside. Personally, I think the art book is kind of a waste of space and unnecessary, but if you're paying out the ass for something like this, you may as well get something extra. Overall, this special edition is probably only gonna interest major fans of the series. It's a great box set.",Lain: Serial Experiments

497014,"This is a superb and rather complex WW II POW movie w/a different twist. Two of the POWs are Tuskegee airmen, both of whom are the target of racist bigotry...especially from one fellow POW, a vindictive Sgt Bedford, who plants a weapon under one of their beds and then informs on him. After he is shot by a firing squad, Sgt Bedford is murdered and the prime suspect is the remaining Tuskegee airman, because of his revenge motive. Instead of summary execution, the senior-ranking American officer, Col McNamara, convinces the camp commandant, Col Visser, to convene a courts martial to try the airman. Lt Hart, by virtue of the fact he was attending law school before the war, is appointed defense lawyer. Hart learns who really killed Sgt Bedford from Col McNamara, and why. If he reveals the information he has learned it will put numerous lives in jeopardy. What will he do? That will set the stage for what is an excellent War movie. If you are intrigued so far, queue it up and see how it plays out...I think you may be surprised by the final outcome. Colin Farrell is Lt Hart and he delivers an exceptional performance; as does Terrence Howard, as the black airman on trial. They are both upstaged though by Bruce Willis as Col McNamara, in one of his finest performances; and by the acclaimed Romanian actor, Marcel Iures, as the camp commandant, Col Visser. Visser is on the one hand a typical sadistic Nazi; but on the other hand, a sympathetic character...Iures, absolutely nails the characterization. Cole Hauser likewise nails the bigoted Sgt Bedford. Universally good acting throughout and excellent pacing by director, Gregory Hoblit. If you're a fan of war movies, I'm betting you will like this",Hart's War

1581969,"In a year jam-packed with blockbusters and art-house thrillers, there are a great many movies that are purely amazing and awesome. Among them are three comic-to-film adaptations: 2 Marvel films and a DC Comic movie. One of these Marvel films is The Wolverine. Set after the events of X-Men The Last Stand, Wolverine/Logan is now away from everything and everyone, wandering the back-roads of the Yukon. But when a girl named Yukio finds Logan, she has him travel to Tokyo, Japan with her to meet with a man from Logan's past. But as Wolverine battles with losing his immortality, he also has to battle his inner demons, which threaten everything he knows.The Wolverine is easily one of the best Marvel films yet, having a good script, great directing, and superb acting from the even greater Hugh Jackman, who truly is Wolverine in this installment. What I found truly incredible, though, is how the action sequences didn't just help bring intensity to the movie, but were needed to help the story move along. Even better, the action sequences were not absolutely massive. Even the battle between Logan and the Silver Samurai (which was one of the most epic action scenes of all time), was not grand in size. James Mangold really knew what he was doing when he directed this, and if you have seen his film 3:10 to Yuma, you can get the feeling that he took some details from that and put them into this movie. The script, by Mark Bomback (the new Total Recall and Live Free or Die Hard) & Scott Frank, was not cheesy, over-the-top, or missing anything needed. The dialogue was great, very believable, and the characters were perfectly written; character development was all over the place! The musical score by Marco Beltrami is easily his best since 3:10 to Yuma, and the visual effects, while not award-winning (compared to other movies this year), are great, never out of place. The cinematography was stunning, with the shots of Nagasaki and Tokyo helping to place the audience and Wolverine in a totally different world.Overall, The Wolverine is the movie Wolverine fans have been wanting for a while now, especially after the mistake that was X-Men Origins. I just hope Jackman is as big in X-Men Days of Future Past as he was here, in both character and physique.4.5/5 Stars",N/A

1641173,"It is such a shame that this is the end of The Borgias. I know in the end it came down to budget, but why start something, try to keep it as authentic as possible, and then abandon it? It's sad because this series is beyond beautiful. Lush, and jarring and opulent. So nearly perfect. Sure, it's not very historically accurate...in fact, hardly at all. But I was so utterly hooked way back in season 1, that it truly didn't matter all that much to me. The characters are intriguing, the costumes, to die for. The acting is just superb, once again thanks to Jeremy Irons who just HAS to be ridicuolusly perfect no matter who he plays. The entire supporting cast is honestly just as good, with extra attention paid to Sean Harris who plays Micheletto with such a sad, but ferocious spirit. So many heartbreaking moments here in this Season. Just the intrigue and mystery, war and incest, angst galore, is enough to constitute The Borgias as one of the most well-done series in quite a long while. Neil Jordan is just so good at what he does. He knows exactly how to set the mood, how to toy with the audience. It's maddeningly delirious and it really is a shame to end it like this. Though I must say, the ending was sublimely delicious, and not a cliffhanger in sight. But then again, what constitutes an ending? Who is to say what is a right place to leave things, and what is wrong? In this case, knowing there was supposed to be more is driving me a bit mad. Like dangling a carrot. Still, I highly recommend this, it really is too good of an experiencet to miss out on.",N/A

His final station is in a military-hating, corrupt law enforcement town. The local sheriff is a John who mistreats his &#34;employees&#34;. Enter Garner: he intervenes when one of the sheriff's officers assaults one of the girls. He assaults the cop, which doesn't go well with the sheriff.The relationship between the sheriff and Garner deteriorates and eventually involves his son, well played by C Thomas Howell. The sheriff plants drugs in Howell's locker, and Garner finally understands he needs to mitigate the issue. As you can well imagine, his mitigation does not work, and Howell ends up in prison. The movie culminates in Garner's utilizing that tank to spring his son, only to discover he is now a fugitive, and the entire county posse wants him taken down.Garner is thoroughly believable in his role as an easy-going officer and a gentleman.  The sheriff is convincing as a slime bag. Howell convinced me he was Garner's son. The only role I was iffy on was Shirley Jones. She was the Partridge Family mom to me, and even when she was ticked at Garner for saving his &#34;whore&#34; and sacrificing his son, she didn't convince me she was angry. She was, however, convincing as an officer's wife and a mother.  Overall, two thumbs up!",Tank
1313368,"This is the sequel to the original film released in 1982. I must say this film has truly stepped up in terms of visuals. Tron Legacy is a stunning computer graphics adventure. Unfortunately, viewers will get the feeling that the film is missing something.The film's synopsis is rather disappointing and could have been better. The plot takes place after the original film. If you have not seen it, do not worry because the events that take place are not necessary to know what is going on. At the same time, it would have been better if the film had not try to stay close to the original. The plot is trying to explain what happened in a gap of nearly 20 years (between the first film and this one). As it attempts to explains, it weakens the plot. It is hard not to notice because the film tries so hard to explain the history of Tron while having various inconsistencies. On the other hand, the characters that bring livelihood into the original has returned. The concept of a going inside the world of computers is truly amazing and makes the film a fantastic adventure.The best part is the special effects. Since the setting of most of the film is inside a computer world, the special effects illustrate the vividness of the realm. Even though this world is only numbers, Disney wows people with the power of imagination and makes viewers wish they were there. The only disappointing thing is CGI Jeff Bridges. It can be easily seen throughout the film which is the real actor himself and a computer generated young version of himself. The computer graphics are amazing in HD. Unlike other films that rely heaving on CGI, this film's special effects is a core element in making it artwork.Another awesome element is the music. The soundtrack by Daft Punk makes the audience feel like they are in this world described in the film. Daft Punk did an excellent job of creating music that follows the mood of the films from action scenes to dramatic and sentimental moments. Like special effects, the music does an good job at bringing viewers into this world of computer programs.Overall, Tron Legacy will most definitely bring your imagination to life and make you want to wish you were a character in this film. On the other hand, Disney could have done better with the plot that was too afraid to leave the film's origins. It succeed in what the previous film could not,special effects, but sacrificed a potentially good plot to fabricate a history lesson that is not necessary of viewers to know.",N/A

1624310,"As a part of the British series ""Theater 625,"" a three part adaptation of Ford Madox Ford's ""Parade's End"" was produced and aired in 1964.  An epic tale of love, scandal, marriage, and war, the original publications were actually a series of four novels released between 1924-28 that were pulled together and packaged under the new title of ""Parade's End.""  The three parts (each approximately 90 minutes) of this miniseries are separated by the original book titles that they represented.  You may be thinking that this is a rather random title to pop out of the BBC archives, but two things make this a surprisingly timely release.  First, a young Judi Dench has one of the biggest female roles as a progressive who captures the heart and mind of the central character.  She's the ""good girl"" of a romantic triangle set amidst the era of World War I.  Secondly, BBC recently aired a 2012 adaptation of ""Parade's End"" written by Tom Stoppard and starring Benedict Cumberbatch.  That production also recently aired in America on HBO.The star of ""Parade's End"" is Ronald Hines, who plays Christopher Tietjens.  Tietjens is an upright aristocrat trapped in a rather complicated marriage to Sylvia (Jeanne Moody).  After establishing the unpleasantness of this pairing, the story has Tietjense meeting a free spirited suffragette (Dench).  The remainder of the story follows these three principles, and assorted other characters, as they navigate a world ravaged by war.Some Do Not..:  In this introductory chapter, we meet the three central characters.  As Tietjens attempts to be the proper gentleman in every circumstance, the cards seem stacked against him.  Cuckolded by a vicious wife, intrigued by a new love, and trying to be a supportive friend, he finds himself in the middle of drama and scandal that is completely unwarranted.  Playing off themes of class and gender, Tietjens is almost victimized by propriety and the results are very personal and devastating.No More Parades:  This episode deals primarily with Tietjens experiences in the war.  As he gets stationed in France and later in Belgium, the conflict is just one more component in his constant struggle for understanding.  Plagued by moral and social constraints, the war only compounds these concerns.  It is almost a physical manifestation of an internal battle.  While he will see some fighting, the biggest challenges still come from within.A Man Could Stand Up:  In the final installment, the war is over and Tietjens must return home.  But into whose arms will he find himself?  Dench steps up into a leading role for this piece which has Tietjens reconciling his past choices.  The war and his recent experiences with Sylvia have really taken a toll, and his soul is battered and bruised.  As he recounts the trauma, the confession serves as a catharsis.  But is it too late to claim a new life?I really enjoyed ""Parade's End"" for its grand storytelling.  But as large as the tale may seem, it is really the journey of one man.  Hines is strong and Dench is charming.  But, for me, the most memorable role is the incomparable Jeanne Moody.  A classic villain in many ways, Moody chews the scenery in almost every instance in a bold and fearless performance.  I was concerned that this production would shy away from some of the unpleasantness inherent in the story (as it is from 1964), but it is still intact if not always graphically depicted.  A nice staging, I'd definitely give this a look if you enjoy classic British drama.  KGHarris, 3/12.",Parade's End

1378795,"I enjoyed this miniseries on Blu-Ray, but I found myself getting more and more annoyed by the editing.  At every commercial break, instead of nicely tapering off the music and sound effects way ahead of time and dissolving the audio with a clean cut for the video so that it feels seamless, they just suddenly duck the music at the last second and do a fast fade past black, often returning to completely different music.As somebody who used to do a lot of TV production work, I found it very jarring, particularly during the third part, where you'd be smack in the middle of an intense action sequence, and then bam, suddenly the entire feel of the program shifts without warning.  That makes it glaringly obvious where every commercial break fell.Contrast this, for example, with Stargate SG-1, where they designed it for continuous viewing, and unless you just know how to spot the act breaks, it feels like a short film.  That's the way TV editing should be done.  Besides, there's no guarantee that a rebroadcast will put the breaks in the same places anyway, which is why a well-edited TV show should *always* be seamless when viewed without commercials even if you don't plan to make it available on DVD.  You can always put in the fades after the fact, but you can't easily take them out if they're poorly burned into the master.This miniseries makes me wonder if any of the editors actually sat down and watched each part from beginning to end before the program aired.  It just feels sloppy.  Somebody should really go back and at least put in some J-cuts or something.",Fallen

It is the movie that established Bob Fosse as a world class director and it is the movie that brought the movie musical into the world of serious drama.  None of these facts are just my humble opinion. Any one of these facts justifies 5 stars.You want this movie, and you will want to play this movie often.Loosely based on the Christopher Isherwood Berlin Stories, Cabaret tells the story of the infamously degenerate cabaret style of Weimar Germany in its last years before the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party. We are meant to see the lives of several people from the viewpoint of the mostly passive British visitor/English teacher ,  Brian Roberts (Michael York) however songstress, ""Zenzation"" Sally Bowles as played by Liza Minnelli dominates her every scene. Every scene except those she shares when on the stage with the Master of Ceremonies Joel Grey.This movie is worth a long analysis. It is even better with the added sections about the making of and the back stage story -something I rarely view much less recommend. You should be advised to pay extra attention to the Cabaret Girls, you have never seen their like before. You should get paragraphs about the genius that has the movie overlapping between the cabaret life of dancing, money and cross dressing bar girls against the growing horror that will be Nazi Germany. There are too many things for just this review even knowing there are many others here detailing many of the same points.Instead, get the movie; share it with people you respect. Watch and learn for yourself. There is too much to see in one or a few showings. This is entertainment, but it is so much more than a movie musical.",N/A

487211,"SHANGHAI CALLING (Writ./Dir. Daniel Hsia, 2012, 100 minutes) is one of those movies that causes me to ache with anger and resentment at the fact that we miss these gems in the first place. I cannot understand the wasted hard work, the talent, that essentially goes down the drain from lack of an audience for such films.This jewel of a film, which should be seen by everyone, grossed just over $10,000 when it opened. That's right, this classic film grossed less than it costs to buy a crappy SUV.Oscar-worthy all around, this is the story of gorgeous corporate lawyer Sam Chou (Daniel Henney), a Chinese-American who is tapped to go to Shanghai by his firm. Since he is of Chinese descent - though 100% American - his firm thinks he'll be more effective. The odious task on which he embarks will not only warm your heart, it will open your eyes about Sino-American business practices.Arriving in Shanghai, Sam quickly learns that the American ""expat"" community understands what it really is: a group of immigrants. The ""mayor"" of the community is a charming and understated Bill Paxton; along the way, others will appear and make this film totally worthwhile and fun.I must say, not only Daniel Henney but this entire film was redolent of a fine Buster Keaton film. Being an aficionado and connoisseur, I felt the entire time as if BK had made this film. Henney has a Keatonesque talent for the smooth, elegant bumbling that endears an audience immediately. Since this is a true family comedy, there is no need for Henney's character to be a true shark. As a comic-dramatic actor, Henney is set free here in a way only Keaton understood/exploited properly.My favorite scene, one I urge you to watch for, is the caf&eacute; scene in which Sam meets a mysterious, wise stranger. That was so funny I found it hard to breathe. And let me add that the Chinese music in the soundtrack is incredibly upbeat and relevant - but it's fun, and I'd like to own the soundtrack along with the film.With the amazing talents of Eliza Coupe, Alan Ruck, Geng Le, Zhu Zhu, Jim Bennett, and Arran Hawkins.",Shanghai Calling(DVD9) (China Version)

1599107,"""Resident Evil:Retribution""(2012) directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Alien vs Predator, Death Race) is the fifth movie in the Resident Evil series. The movie takes place mostly inside a computer generated world that is located underwater in the Arctic Circle. This movie seems to be somewhat a departure from previous films in the series being more sci-fi action than horror. Upon first viewing this film in 2D I didn't feel that this film was particularly captivating given its rather generic characters and predictable plot, but watching it in 3D I just can't get enough of it. This is a fun, visually rich film which takes us through a myriad of environments. For those with 3D you'll be smiling from beginning to end as the images are enthralling and spectacular. This movie is a visual treat with beautifully directed and constructed environments which moves quickly from scene to scene without boring the viewer. Obviously a lot of money and thought was put into the visuals of this film, and the limited characters and story line really in the end don't seem to matter too much. Like a beautiful painting one just wants to gaze at its marvellous images.Other recommendations for movies in 3D are Prometheus, Tron, Underworld:Awakening, Avatar, and The Avengers.",N/A

314689,"Warner Archive and the Samuel Goldwyn people have come up with a wonderful new edition of WHOOPEE!, one of the relatively few films of that period (1930) photographed entirely in primitive Technicolor. The previous video release showed the limited color palette exactly as it was, with various shades of reds and greens. (Before 1934 Technicolor was incapable of recording shades of blue.)This new DVD restores the blue! It doesn't skew the entire image toward blue, which would alter the existing colors and flesh tones. Rather, the video technicians have color-corrected only certain portions of the picture, so the western skies are actually blue instead of green most of the time. Purists may cry foul, but the effect really is an improvement. The tweaking is subtle, not blatant. Also, the technicians have taken pains to piece together the best possible print from multiple sources. (In the later reels you may notice pale color in the long shots giving way to more vivid color in the closer shots.)The movie itself is great fun to watch, with hypochondriac Eddie Cantor nervously taking a cure on a western ranch. Cantor is still in his brash, fresh-kid character from his Ziegfeld stage days, before he adopted a more timid demeanor for movies. His dialogue exchanges with Broadway co-star Ethel Shutta are timed flawlessly, and you'll laugh out loud at the explosive punchlines. The comedy is typical of the twenties, with plenty of snappy comebacks and groanworthy jokes, and there is some dated dialect humor in places, but Eddie and company deliver it with such enthusiasm that you'll be chuckling along with it. Director Thornton Freeland does try to make the stage presentation more cinematic with scenic outdoor shots, plus elaborate dance routines (by Busby Berkeley) from vantage points that couldn't be seen in a stage performance. The musical pageants are typical of a '20s show, with a mixed chorus and its sometimes unintelligible diction, but the solo songs are fine, including Cantor's signature ""Makin' Whoopee."" (Watch for 13-year-old Betty Grable as an exuberant cowgirl.)If you like Eddie Cantor, grab this now because he carries most of the show. If you've never seen him, this makes a good introduction.",Whoopee VHS
1666802,"Approachable and inviting, this adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy does the unthinkable--it manages to keep the language without seeming stilted in a more modern setting. Part of what makes Shakespeare difficult is that to perform it you must have a keen understanding of it, and many actors struggle to really inhabit the meaning rather than simply recite the lines. To inhabit while mastering a complicated comedic timing and beat-for-beat sparring match with the other actors? I have nothing but respect for anyone able to play Beatrice and Benedick well.On that note, Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof have phenomenal chemistry. The black and white lends the film a noir-ish feel that matches the cagey humor, and Nathan Fillion and Tom Lenk are crazy-cool as the cops that get it right by accident. The girl who plays Hero has a beautiful dignity that made me want to cry during the (first) wedding scene. Amy Acker's performance of the &#34;If I were a man&#34; speech is heart-rending, and for a play supposedly about nothing, the combined weight of a woman's honor and a man's pride have a very real presence throughout. Visually interesting, full of unforced humor, and grounded in a deeply felt love story, Much Ado about Nothing is worth every bit of its 'ado'.",N/A

1585426,"From [...]The Wachowskis are at the top of their game with Cloud Atlas. A sibling duo of film creators the two always swing for the fences with their films and with Cloud Atlas they hit it out of the park. This movie is story telling and film making firing on all cylinders and never misses a beat.An epic tale of fate, love, friendship, humanity, greed, envy, and the human spirit is told through several time lines in several settings. The all star cast takes on up to six roles each of varying forms, changing not only their basic attributes to fit the time period but even full on racial and gender changes.The transformations of the characters appearance is literally just the surface of the changes the actors take on. Accents, voices, and mannerisms disappear and new ones are created with absolute perfection.The cast is outstanding in all the roles they take on. Tom Hanks, Halle berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae (in her first English speaking roles), Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D&#8217;Arcy, Hugh Grant, and more all take on at least three roles and up to seven. The three directors it took to capture a story many criticized as being &#8220;un-filmable&#8221; also adapted the David Mitchell novel for the screen. Lana and Andy Wachowski along with Tom Tykwer.There is no absolute direct thread or linear path that the characters undergo that can be traced in black and white. Rather the decisions a soul makes in life cause a ripple effect that don&#8217;t only change an individuals karmic destiny but ripple throughout time. A lost love in one life can be realized in another, past crimes against your fellow man may require redemption paid out through decades. Every character has their own journey within their life times and every character&#8217;s soul has a journey through time. The advertising and many plot synopsis make the movie sound unruly and confusing. In reality this sprawling epic tale is massive but the Wachowski&#8217;s and Tom Tykwer never lose control of this massive undertaking. The story is large and spans time but it is not confusing. The actors get to talk on so many different roles of varying importance so that no one actor gets played out or causes the audience fatigue.Cloud Atlas is multiple stories in one, many different themes and genres are explored and all of them are explored properly. Any one of these individual stories could be a movie entirely by itself and it would be incredible to watch. While the smaller stories within Cloud Atlas take on different genres they also take on different tones. One of the threads is a very witty and fun comedy and a separate story line has some epic sci-fi action scenes. The fact that these elements don&#8217;t leak out of their main story lines doesn&#8217;t hurt the integrity of the movie but still gives the audience the emotional jolts as they need them.The make up is an achievement in itself. It is never over done or shocking to see. It all fits so naturally even knowing what the actors under the prosthetic look like. The make up is trans-formative and subtle at the same time. The audience is never taken out of the movie by an unconvincing look or cheesy prosthetic. The score for the movie is yet another element the Wachowski&#8217;s nailed along with Tykwer. Tykwer even worked on the original music for the film along with the other composers. The score for the film rises and falls with the audience&#8217;s emotions. As a film-goer you would be hard pressed to see this modern epic along with the immersive score without being totally engrossed in the spectacle before you.Cloud Atlas is everything the movie industry needs right now. This movie speaks for itself and is incredibly entertaining while being an absolute masterpiece. This is something that as an audience member you don&#8217;t just see, you experience.",Cloud Atlas

1443759,"There have been some number of ""issue"" movies over the years. This is better than average, but just a bit.Here's the scoop. Gavin (Charlie Hunnam) is a likable, easy going hotel manager. He gets new neighbors in his building, Shana and Joe Harris (Liv Tyler and Patrick Wilson). It's realized right off the bat that Gavin and Joe are on opposite sides of the ""God"" issue, and as Gavin finds himself uncontrollably drawn to Shana the issue is brought to its extreme with Gavin finding himself on a tall ledge poised to jump.I like this kind of movie because I'm drawn to these kinds of arguments. Writer/Director Matthew Chapman is clearly siding with Gavin, but shows good reason why Joe and Shana are so strongly religious. The four principal characters, Gavin, Joe, Shana and detective Hollis Lucetti (Terrence Howard) who is trying to talk Gavin off the ledge, all have or had life altering problems in their lives. They merely chose different ways to re-emerge into the world. So the viewer does not want to slot them as me good you bad black and white. But finally how far will you go to defend your belief? Where is the line that you will not cross?This is a good watch. Hunnam has a certain presence in front of the camera but he's got a rather narrow range as an actor. His role needed someone with much more gravity. I liked Wilson and Tyler a lot. I thought they handled their roles well. I find Howard not much better than Hunnam. I'm glad they switched him out for Don Cheadle in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But this all moves at a steady pace and you really want to know how Gavin will handle his deadline. I found the progression from the opening scene, where Gavin climbs out on the ledge, to the backtracking of how he came to be there, very satisfying. They did need more time with him and Howard squaring off, but that's a rather minor quibble.There were a fair number of small things that would have made this a better film but it's pretty good as it is.",The Ledge
1646466,"This was more violent than I expected. Had it not been animated, I think it would have merited an R rating. Pretty dark, and I'm still not sure exactly why.Flash is a fun character, and I'm glad they finally told a story about him. Of course, the Flash they focused on was Barry Allen, and the show seemed to assume that viewers know a lot about him when I knew next to nothing. (The Flash I was familiar with is Wally.) Barry seemed...I don't know. Maybe too much like the others? I knew how Wally worked within the Justice League, but we hardly see anything of Barry and his world before we're launched into a dystopian alternate universe. Watching him in action was cool, but I didn't feel like I got much of a sense of him as a person.But the bigger problem was the larger story. I don't know whether I want to watch it again simply because I watch to be entertained and enjoy myself, not to make myself sick watching people kill or torture each other or being depressed with messages about how awful people are or life is. (I'm exaggerating a little, but not as much as I wish I was.) The story never answered critical questions. For example...SPOILERSFlash's attempt to use time travel through the Speed Force to prevent the murder of his mother is somehow responsible for all of the problems that have come about in this alternate universe. But I thought what caused the problems wasn't saving his mother in itself, but the act of breaking the chronal barrier? If so, catching up to his younger self and stopping him wouldn't have prevented any of this because his younger self had already broken that barrier. And it doesn't explain how Flash's actions could change so many things that happened at different times. (Ex: Superman's arrival as a baby, the shooting of Bruce's parents, the arrival of Abin Sur and Hal taking on the mantle of the Green Lantern. Nit pick, but why would the ring not have found Hal even if the timing had changed a little and he wasn't right there?)Then too, the story never explains critical changes in characters, specifically Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Those who developed this plot clearly don't take them seriously as heroic characters, because they have these guys go to the dark side and way above and beyond in destroying the world and others based on a tragic but isolated incident, a personal feud. The plot relies on neither of them having any sense of proportion or any concern for the impact of their conflict on the earth and on their peoples, when that is about as uncharacteristic for both of them as it gets. None of that made any sense. Heroism may be developed and fostered by associating with high-caliber people, but it comes from what's already there in people. Yet this story never explains why these characters are suddenly and somehow without any sense of morality.In any case, well-done in a lot of ways, but disturbing and with some serious plot holes so far as I'm concerned.",DCU:Justice League:Flashpoint Paradox

602402,"This miniseries comes from back in the days before all you had to do to call a movie a ""miniseries"" was to make it big enough that it had to run on two or more nights. It's the same logic as using the term ""box set"" for any audio CD that requires two discs. Okay--end of rant.Failing farmer Will Henry Lee (Wayne Rogers) decides to accept the job of Delano's first chief of police rather than dig himself further into debt with credit extensions banker Hugh Holmes (Charlton Heston) still would have approved. But Holmes in his other role of the town's most prominent citizen agrees with Will Henry on his career change--he's the one who suggests the new job to him to begin with and supports his candidacy. Holmes also serves as voice-over narrator at intervals during the film. One person who does not agree is Sheriff Skeeter Willis (Paul Sorvino), who feels that Will Henry is not tough enough to be a cop. One other citizen who shares that view is reclusive landowner Foxy Funderburke (Keith Carradine), who was the other candidate for the job and didn't get chosen. Funderburke serves as the clich&eacute; ""mad hermit"" of the story. The story runs through an epic five decades, with other stars such as Billy Dee Williams as the first black chief much later in the film, plus Victoria Tennant (who we know from her co-starring role in ""Winds Of War/ War and Remembrance"") as the beautiful and gutsy English ""war bride"" of Will Henry's son Billy.Now as for the lousy sound. According to a disclaimer slide at the beginning of this DVD version, the original film suffered a lot of damage to the soundtrack while in storage, so it can't be helped. I believe I still have VHS tapes of this miniseries I grabbed off the air which sound better. But we'll have to wait for whatever tech improvements clean that up if there is a later version of this.

I'm sorry to say that she died the same year this film was completed and we lost a fine actress.* Tara Morice (""Razzle Dazzle"") is Fran, the poor student stuck in Beginners, who has aspirations... She does janitorial work to pay for her lessons. It is Scott who asks her, ""Do you think you could dance without those glasses?"" (I LOVE clich&eacute;s!)* Bill Hunter (""Finding Nemo"") is Barry Fife, who disqualifies Scott for not using Federation-approved dance steps.

1378193,"There have been so many reviews of this collection but there is no discernment as to which collection is which.  That and a million summaries and opinions about which movies are best, which versions, plot lines, acting, characters, Jar Jar Binks hate club, etc&#8230;so I will focus, briefly, only upon the quality of the blu rays within the collection as pictured above.The only problem is that if I did a audio/video review of each film separately, I know it would be highly redundant so I will lump most of these films together.  Changes that have been made, I will not mention as some were significant and some unnoticeable.  This is the first time I have watched all of the films in chronological order on a hi end home theater utilizing a 7.1 audio system and viewing them on a Panasonic 65&#34; ZT monitor which is highly touted for its excellence in delivering true colors and deep blacks.The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi  each present outstanding video imaging with excellent color grading and a lack of haloing from the many CGI effects.  You can certainly see advancements in filming technology as the films progress from when each was originally made but that can not be helped and Lucas and producers should not be faulted for it.For me, the Audio in all these films is the star.  Each film automatically defaults to a DTS HD MA 6.1 lossless audio and here we have a collection of films whose audio editing was not cut off for budget reasons.  In a  7.1 audio system the two rear channels will be simply muxed into a single 6th channel.  Each of these films utilizes, and wonderfully so, all the surrounds, front, back and sides as well as the LFE sub channel to their fullest extent.  There is a huge amount of discreet directionality as star ships and other foley fx are created.  You are always right in the middle of the audio field and that field is not only the center channel as most films are.For me, any of these films's audio tracks are totally demo worthy of anyone wanting to show off the quality of their systems.  If your system is less than ideal, they might also show off their weaknesses as well.  The LFE channel is required to dig deep down low to produce the very intense bass that dives below the frequency response of many subwoofers on the market.  A true treat.The first Star Wars film, A New Hope, broke incredible ground when it was first released and started everything off.  I recall sitting in  the movie theater in 1977 and being amazed with the first film that had true surround sound audio.  It was great and it did start a major franchise.  Now, all these many years later, the transfer of the film to Blu Ray is a success but not without an albeit.  The video transfer is excellent and I found no faults with it.  The lossless DTS HD MA 6.1 audio, however good it may be, does not come close to the audio tracks of all the other films in the series.  When compared to many films released today, it still comes out the winner but when compared to the other Star Wars films, you will notice that discreet fx presentation is not quite as often with many of the foley more or less  muxed into one  track.  I would still give the audio of A New Hope 5 stars but must lower it to 4 when compared to the audio of the other films.Can't say I have listened or watched all the extras but I did watch all 90 minutes of the various Star Wars Spoofs.  Loved all of them except for, probably, the oldest of them, a bit on the Donnie and Marie Osmond show that was almost embarrassing to view.  The others were all great and many were from the same shows and cartoon series.Other discs have various documentaries covering all things Star Wars.I realize that this review is far more concise than many other reviews of this collection but let's just say that the whole collection, for me, is an excellent one to have.  Were there some scenes I was not familiar with or didn't recall, yep, were changes made here and there, yep but nothing I didn't enjoy never the less.All my reviews focus only on the quality of the actual transfer of a film to blu ray and I do hope that this type of review has been helpful to you in deciding your purchase.Thanks for reading.",Star Wars: The Complete Saga - Episodes I-VI

1661980,"Binge-watching-worthy set of five episodes. If you like suspenseful, scary detective story thrillers that keep you tensely (in a cathartic way) watching to see what happens next, you may, like me, fall for this series. Warning- violence and corruption abounds. Gillian Anderson is outstanding as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson.  Gillian doesn't need great lines so much as she simply is an expressive actress.  She may be icy, of few words, but she projects so much. Her character is very focused and cerebral and is the first to realize there are linked, serial murders happening in Belfast. Her nemesis, serial murderer Paul Spector, is a revelation as the type of psychopath that is never suspected by anyone.  One realizes the damage he does will be staggeringly magnified once he is caught and people who knew him will be cut to the quick trying to comprehend how this grief counselor, father of two young children and husband to a devoted trusting wife, hid a furtive double life of depraved premeditated murderer.  At one point Spector's wife puzzles about their 8 year old daughter's recurring nightmares, and wishes she knew what was going on in her daughter's mind.  Spector,who is hiding his drawings, photos, murder trophies, and journal in the crawl space just above his daughter's bed, says, ""No one knows what's going on in someone else's mind.  Life would be terrible if we did.""In some ways this series reminds me of ""The Wire"".  It holds nothing back and equally exposes the multi-leveled corruption as it follows the police involved in the investigation as well as the miscreant and his family.  Although the writing and story are compelling, it is the acting and directing that are so well done here. It is not so much the beauty of the presentation, as it is fascinating as the camera hunts and stalks, often from intriguing angles,  and reveals to the viewer, just what is really happening here.I often watch ""Criminal Minds"" on TV.  Although the acting and problem solving are very good,they present a complete story in a limited hour framework. I am often left wanting something more.  Sure there is the great camaraderie on Criminal Minds, excellent actors, and a plot--sometimes too gruesome to bear watching. Then mystery is solved, and it all ends so quickly with perhaps a final scene with the team flying home and usually a great literate quote.  In contrast, this extended multi-episode style of presenting one case, feels more intimate and gives more character input to ponder. At times the narrative parallels the various characters: Spector and his shadow journal, Detective Gibson and her dream journal during the night and the daughter's teacher at school calling both parents in for a conference over the daughter's drawings.  The teacher is concerned about the  drawings and how they relate to what's going on at home. Or a sequence with Spector setting out on another skulking murder, which may end with him bathing the corpse and posing it for photos, while his wife, a neonatal nurse, attends a grieving parent who can not bear to let go of her newborn child who has just passed. She kindly suggests she bathe and dress the baby so the mother may take some photos before releasing her child. There's a stoic Detective Gibson swimming her morning laps in the pool while in another part of Belfast Spector is out on a morning training jog, and so on. The series has been approved to film another season, ""The Fall"".  Quite a disturbing series, and a clarion call for mankind to step up and look at how we are functioning on this planet.","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

1562568,"Disney&#8226;Pixar&#8217;s first prequel plays around a little with the mythology of the Monsters (which is fully explained in the fine audio commentary), brings Mike Wazowski more to the forefront and ups the onscreen creature ante from about 25 to more than 250.Many have opined that Monsters University cannot pack the emotional punch of its predecessor. Let&#8217;s face it, without an adorable little girl like Boo, the emotional is at least different if not as intense.Mike is actually a more sympathetic character than Sully, who has had everything handed to him throughout life and learns that effort is necessary to really succeed. We also get a few origin stories, particularly focusing on creep-in-the-making Randall.Too many recent animated features seem to have a checklist approach to the supporting characters, rehashing &#8220;types&#8221; rather than coming up with something new. Not so here, with such new friends as middle-aged Don, the kind of guy you might meet in night school.The voice cast is, as always, impeccably cast with recognizable names chosen for what they bring to the characters and story, as well as the best Hollywood voice actors rounding out the ensemble.Randy Newman&#8217;s score is a little different from what one might typically expect.

1602807,"Alex is a Jewish man living in Paris; he has a brother, Isaac who is a leech on him both financially and emotionally. With their mother dead they are finding it hard to be good family members. This is exacerbated by the fact that neither has day jobs and Alex is a drug dealer albeit small time. Then he gets an offer to move to Tel Aviv to co own and run a restaurant and he sees it as the perfect way to get out of the cycle of meaningless living that he has fallen into.This means he is doing the `aliyah' which is when a Jew returns to Israel or comes home. He starts to learn Hebrew and has to get his money together. At the same time he meets and falls for the lovely Jeanne (Adele Haenel `Three Worlds' and `Les Diables'). As he ups his drug dealing to get the cash together, things start to go wrong and he has to make some hard decisions about what he really wants and if he is prepared to really change his life and leave behind all he knows including best mate Mathias (Guillaume Gouix `Beyond the walls').This is proper story telling, it is a slice of someone's life and all the threads that go to make it up and as we change and grow so those threads can change or completely unravel. This is the first full length feature from Elie Wajeman and it is clear he has real talent; He has also managed to get some top rate if not well known actors on board so I hope we see and hear a lot more from him. The film examines the emotional and psychological pressures that friends, family, religion and circumstance can often heap upon us - sometimes almost subliminally. The beauty here is in the detail so even the background is sometimes used as a device for the tale to unfold.This is presented in French and Hebrew with good subtitles. High production values, an engrossing story and top notch acting make this a film that should be on your `watch list' as ever Film Movement have found and presented an excellent independent film, which is not available in Region 2 at the time of writing, which is a shame. This also includes a short from Wajeman `On the road to Tel Aviv' and it too is a little corker; altogether a brilliant package that I can highly recommend.",N/A

749640,"The first season of this series was pretty tame compared to later sessions since Jack spent way too much time wringing his hands over his repeatedly kidnapped family. With season 2, we finally get to see Jack in full hard a** mode. He kills people at the drop of a hat and even (spoiler alert) chops off the head of one of them and carries it around in a gym bag to advance his goals. He also attains somewhat ridiculous but enduring superman powers, surviving plenty of near death and yes (spoiler alert) even full death experiences with out much damage. OK. Not very likely. It's even silly at times. But overall,  it's entertaining. Far more entertaining than the first season. Newbies might just want to skip the first season entirely and start here. But lots of lingering characters from season 1 might make it little confusing. The only downside to this season is strangely weak finale. And a cliffhanger ending that is largely meaningless since it is only tangentially related to what happens in season 3.",24: Season 2

612766,"I remember when this was released.  It was around the time that Nicholson was still considered an acting god and Sandler was still considered funny.  Things have changed and both of their careers are less than admirable at this point (Nicholson is still a god, but one that coasts on a clich&eacute;, but Sandler is a mess) and this particular film rests as the beginning of the end for both of them.  I mean, this came one year after Nicholson's last great role (`About Schmidt') and right before Sandler had a string of ridiculous lows.`Anger Management' could have been funny, and I'm sure that on paper it looked like it would be a giant success, but the film fails to ever live up to any potential.  Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler yelling at one another for two hours just isn't as funny as you'd think it would be, and the endless barrage of failed jokes make this a burden to watch.  It grows tiresome and winds up draining the spirit out of the audience.  The cameos fail to make any impact (save for Reilly and Graham, to a degree).  At the end of the day this is just another one of Sandler's ill-advised film choices.The worst thing about `Anger Management' is that it is trying to have a good time but in the process it just gets everything wrong.  That seems to be Sandler's issue.  He has too much fun ruining everyone else's good time.  His humor has faded and he no longer understands how to carry a film, and Nicholson is just content in his old age to play a caricature of his own perceived persona.  There is nothing new anymore, and this is quite frankly the worst portrayal of Jack Nicholson that Nicholson has given us to date.",Anger Management
1329679,"I loved this film. I've admired Cillian Murphy for several years, and he was incredibly good in this movie. It's difficult to talk about it without giving away too much, but I would say that the acting was superb from all the major players: Murphy, Page, Sarandon, Lucas, Pullman. It was spooky, sad and frightening. There are some elements that might somewhat remind the viewer of Psycho, but it is NOT that movie and stands on its own merit. The cinematography is very good, and the 'look' (house, rural scenes, etc) gives you such a feeling of sorrow and melancholy, you cannot help but be moved by it.",N/A

1643639,"In the beginning, there is the mysterious apartment 5 at the end of the hall in an apartment complex where the local rock DJ lives. Sherri Moon Zombie plays this character to the bone.  Then she gets a record dropped off at the radio station. She plays the record on air while an author who wrote a book about witches is the on air guest. Spoiler Alert. I was onboard at this point but the train derailed. The film had an old school 1970's supernatural movie feel. It wasn't supposed to be gory just that creepy the witches/devil are out there plotting something. Things took a bad turn when the screen flashed with some Scooby Doo psychedelic stuff promoting the radio show the main character worked on. Then the scene with the witches being burned. Everyone knows a witch has never been burned in Salem or the US. Burning witches was a European thing. The Salem witches were hanged. Salem is as close to Halloween Town in the Nightmare Before Christmas as any place in the US. The Bewitched statue was shown but that was about all the viewer got to see of Salem. It was definitely shot on location. The old buildings are there. There is an old graveyard in Salem where the crypts are practically crumbling with weird skeleton angels on the graves. That could have made a great scene. When Rob Zombie stays closer to reality or at least something that could happen it is gold. Devil's Rejections, that could really happen and that is why it is so scary. Dealing with witches and devils cannot go off into campy or it is not scary. Did Hocus Pocus scare anyone? The scenes which some reviewers thought were art do not work in a horror film. I think it was Halloween 2 where Michael Myers and his mother are in a field and are dancing around as if they are on a LSD trip, it did not work. The author investigating the witches could have been played up more. The witches were not scary. Three old broads drinking down some tea every five seconds reminded me of Murder She Wrote. The opening scene witches who came back throughout the movie where kinda scary. The scene with the devils touching themselves was beyond lame. The lobster baby that the DJ gives birth to looked like they got it out of the tank at Red Lobster. The fat devil child had no connection to the movie and was super cartoony. Near the end, the movie melted down into a crazy bunch of images that just did not fit and did not help the story. The end was pretty good as it was mixed in with the credits. It was the old newscaster voice summing things up. Because in the last 20 seconds the viewer gets that, the music is being played for the descendants of the Judge and the townspeople who killed the witches. Until that point, it was only clear the descendant of the Judge was to bear the lobster baby. The other women being brought to slaughter could have been move of the movie. The Judge and the townspeople who were in on the hangings are buried in a cemetery in the middle of Salem with these creepy old trees. That could have been used. The location was just about wasted and this film went off the rails of the crazy train but not in a fun ride kind of way.",N/A

My only complaint is that these films wouldv'e been perfect as two parts instead of a trilogy. It did drag a bit but only a few parts. One good thing about this being a trilogy though, their covering extra things the book didn't quite go into explanation on, so that's a definite plus.

223946,"What a find this movie was!  The story line is timeless: do we choose those close to us based on social class, or do we choose people based on who they are and how we feel about life when we're with them? How the movie answers this question kept my attention the entire time, such that I didn't want this to end.Thelma Ritter plays the lead male's mother.  I had a prior impression of her as being too brash for my tastes.  In this movie, however, she showed the scope of her acting skills, and I was impressed!  (No wonder she won the Academy Award for best supporting actress.) Yes, she can and did play brash, but here she also expresses a diverse range of behaviors and emotions.Gene Tierney was someone I was unfamiliar with before seeing this video, and initially, I was worried that she'd end up being just a two-dimensional doll.  Not true, as she hit just the right notes of graciousness, warmth, sincerity, and big-heartedness in her role as the ambassador's daughter.  Her screen husband, also a hunk, was not a disappointment, either, delivering a surprisingly nuanced interpretation of his role as her husband (and Thelma Ritter's screen son).  As for two-dimensional characters, this is a comedy, and so some just have to be included!  In this regard, Tierney's screen mother was presented as a narcissistic shrew, and we saw the boss's son as a superficial, sleazy schemer.  Both created essential plot tension, and did great jobs at being villainous.The story line took viewers on a twisting, turning ride, keeping me glued to the screen.  Moreover, the witty writing was delicious!  It had a quality seldom seen in modern films (which I say with resignation--because regarding current offerings, I'd trade all the special effects in the world for well-written scripts like this one!).This movie delivers so much heart and decency that you'll leave it uplifted.  OK, perhaps the finale was just a little too good to be true.  (It'd be amazing if real life always concluded so well!)  Even so, by then you've genuinely come to care about the main characters, such that it's easy to smile at the wrap-up. This is a movie I'll be glad to watch again.",N/A

A guard jumps on him to spoil his shot, and he is captured. His equipment is British. Capt. Alan Thorndike is questioned. Thorndike says it was a ""sporting stalk"". Is this a symbol of English decadence? Thorndike will be set free if he admits he was a government assassin. A refusal means he will be taken away for torture. Will he sign a confession? No. Will they make it look like an accident? The next morning they find the rifle but not Thorndike's body. Dogs are sent to scent his whereabouts. Walking thru water kills his scent. A boat searches the lake. Thorndike finds a Danish ship and hides in a closet. It will sail to London with a stowaway. A man watches him leave then signals to other German spies in London. Is he trapped?Thorndike enters a house for refuge from the men following him. He asks a woman for cash, he can't travel on foot. A taxi cab takes him to his brother's mansion with Jerry Stokes. Who is after him? Can he be extradited to Germany? They know he is there. Jerry brings him ""fish and chips"" to eat. Will Jerry travel with him? She will be safer alone. A watcher releases a messenger pigeon. Thorndike tells Farnsworthy to not believe any report os a ""suicide"", then leaves by the back entrance. He is followed to the train, and afterwards. There is a struggle with a tail. The victim was identified as Thorndike by his passport. The police are looking for a man with a scar on his cheek. Thorndike says goodbye to Jerry. A Bobby separates them. Jerry returns home to find unexpected visitors who want to chat. When ""D. F. Stokes"" arrives at the Lyme Regis Post Office there is a complication. He returns to his hide-out, a cave. The letter carries a threat.He was followed! He is sealed up as in a grave. They want Thorndike alive, so he can sign a confession ""A lie is relative, as is truth."" He is given the beret owned by Jerry. She refused to talk, and was found dead in the street. The police called it a suicide. They want Thorndike's confession for a ""White Paper"" to justify the war. ""Tomorrow the whole world."" Thorndike improvises a primitive weapon. [Any animal that takes refuge in a cave is trapped.] Is he free at last? Next they show scenes of the start of WW II. Thorndike is in the RAF. He parachutes into Germany with a precision rifle and has a mission to accomplish. [Implausible, given the Gestapo's system of checking on passports etc.]This movie was derived from Geoffrey Household's novel ""Rogue Male"", who also wrote other best-selling books. I remember the book being better than the movie. This has some implausible scenes about German spies in Britain. ""The Double Cross System"" tells how about the efficient British Secret Service. Every German spy sent into Britain was captured, then doubled, imprisoned, or executed. There were other books as well. They had a ""Most Secret Source"" that provided reliable information. ""The Two-Headed Spy"" movie tells about their cleverness.",Man Hunt

936704,"I was prepared to be underwhelmed by this movie, based on some of the comments.  Instead, however, I ended up glad that I'd lucked out and found a good movie to watch!  (That is, it wasn't one of those Prime movies that I click off after half an hour, because it just isn't holding my attention.)Yes, it did start slowly, as some have noted, and yes, the bleak Oklahoma landscape shown in the beginning isn't much appealing.  Even so, as the viewer soon discovers, in this ""it looks like nothing happens here"" environment, there is a LOT going on behind the scenes!  What the movie does well is to artfully present, through character interactions, a reliable stream of hints and clues about those ""not so ordinary"" happenings.  This sustained suspense makes the movie compelling and intriguing.Connie Nielsen is outstanding in her portrayal of a widow convicted of child kidnap and murder.  She doesn't necessarily ""act"" like a cold-blooded killer (isn't dead behind the eyes, etc.).  Still, she presents enough of an odd detachment, along with some quirkiness, that I kept wondering if she'd committed the crime or not.  Well along into the movie, I still didn't know quite how to regard her, and so (as part of that suspense factor), I was always wanting to know more.Aidan Quinn, playing a washed up attorney with seemingly shady motives, is likewise more than he first seems to be at the movie's outset.  His character experiences a slow metamorphosis, which caused me to increasingly warm up to his role.  I respect a movie which delivers plausibility for a character's evolving perspectives (because it seems like the script is respecting me as a viewer).  Here, Quinn's confusion, his reflection, his twists and turns, etc., are never forced, and so they never arbitrarily manipulate the audience.  Rather, they serve to give his character depth and appeal.Kelly Preston, as the attorney for the convict, has a smaller role, but the story would not have been nearly as good without her!  She is very well-cast, and lends a strong presence.  Her nuanced portrayal makes her character seem like a real person who happens to practice law (rather than being a stick figure caricature of a lawyer).  Rarely do I see a film where three key characters all end up giving top notch performances, but I'm glad to say that this movie is a fine exception.  The supporting characters were also good, for the most part.I had no problem keeping my interest from the beginning.  Even so, I noticed that I was getting more and more drawn in as the movie progressed, and that was a great feeling.  One reviewer here said that the final 15 minutes were what made the movie worthwhile.  It's true that the conclusion is a stirring reward.  Still, I could never dismiss what comes before it, because the context and character developments offered prior to the finale, are completely essential.  All kinds of seemingly unrelated loose threads get wrapped up then, and it all happens in ways that cannot be predicted.For me, the story lacks some plausibility, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  Still, I was more than happy to sacrifice some plausibility for a compelling sense of suspense and well-drawn characters.  I like a movie that's as much about the characters as it is about the plot.The subtle pacing invited more engagement from me than I'd likely give to, say, an action movie.  The fact that my attention was required especially made the movie ""get into me.""  I was engaged enough that after the video concluded, I found myself musing a bit, speculating about what would happen next to the characters shown in the final scene.  Having enjoyed the movie a lot, I guess I didn't want it to be over!Go and ahead and give the video a try (especially if you're a Prime member!).  I think you'll enjoy it.",Convicted

With this all said, it's difficult to both not like, and to like, Wright's film.The post-modern approach to setting each scene on a &#34;stage&#34; just didn't work and it actually took away from the important context of the story.  I understand why Wright wanted to do this but it just doesn't work.  The setting of this story has everything to do with who the characters are and why the story is so tragic.  I wanted to see more of the countryside to understand Levin; more of St. Petersburg as the backdrop for Anna and Vronsky's heated attraction.  The weird theater backdrops not only didn't add to the landscape of the story, they took something away from it.I love Aaron Taylor-Johnson.  He was great in Kick Ass (don't be a hater - watch the film.  It's hilarious) and he was wonderful in Albert Nobbs.  The kid can act and he's very good looking.  But Vronksy's character is complex; yes he's a naive kid in many ways, but he's also sophisticated enough to match Anna in wit and in worldliness.  Taylor-Johnson was not old enough for this role and was not convincing.  I think a more experienced actor - maybe someone like Tom Hardy who is wonderful in period works, would have been good.Keira was wonderful.  Her clothes were spectacular; elegantly beautiful.  She was Anna - through and through.  The supporting actors were great too - especially Levin and Kitty.  But where was Levin's story?  The beauty of Anna Karenina is that Tolstoy balances out the story of false love / lust (Anna's affair with Vronsky) with what real love / commitment really are (Levin and Kitty's story).  I wanted more of Levin's story but of course, an almost 800 page book is hard to fit into a 2 to 3 hour film.I think this film is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the novel and or of Joe Wright's work.  But keep in mind it's flawed.",N/A
1630118,"I can count on one hand the movies I'd consider good that I've seen recently in theaters. And I'd consider this one to be better than just good.Here's a run down of the movie without spoiling anything: Carolyn and Roger Perron move into a Rhode Island home with their 5 daughters in 1971. First bruises appear out of no where, clocks stop, weird smells occur and everything quickly gets worse. As the situation progressively gets worse Carolyn attends a class where Ed and Lorraine Warren are teaching and explaining what they do and about the paranormal. Carolyn seeks their help and has them come to her home to see if they can rid her family and home of this dark presence. The Warrens discover this to be their most difficult and horrifying case.The film is based on a true story which alone makes it that much more frightening. There's no gore, nudity, and honestly I can't remember any swearing either. So a film being rated R for purely the scare factor should peak your interest.The acting was great. Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren, Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren, and Lili Taylor as Carolyn Perron were the shining stars. The rest of the cast including the daughters all did great also.Definitely worth seeing more than once. Go watch it!",N/A

1543334,"If it hadn't been for the fine acting in this version of Tolstoy's classic tale, the use of the stage as a prop for the whole thing would have defeated it.  But the performance of Kiera Knightly, Jude Law, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as well as a fine supporting cast rescued the film from total debacle.  If you look at it more as a filmed stage play, the use of the stage might be acceptable.  The ending is pretty standard and Vronsky comes off as a cad in this version, but we also see more of Karenin, thanks to the performance of Jude Law, and how the romance of Anna and Vronsky effect Karenin's career.  It is almost as if you need both this version and the Marceau version to get a really rounded look at the story.

1614476,"It's a shame this movie had to have been released in theaters in this day and age. Had it come out in the 90's it would have been more well received, and typical of the creature features of the time: Lake Placid, Anaconda, Deep Blue Sea, The Relic, etc. If it had premiered on SyFy it would be considered the greatest TV movie ever. Unfortunately, neither happened, so I can easily see why it let many people down. It's a creature feature stuck in limbo. It's too good for SyFy, but not good enough to play in today's theaters. The spider effects are quite good, while the occasional digital rat would have looked OK ten years ago.The budget does not allow for the massive scale attack on the populace of New York that people were hoping for. Instead the city is evacuated before the spiders surface (at the climax) so it's just a handful of civilians and the military that are left. Judging it as a low budget typical creature feature it's great. As a theatrically released spiders-attack-New York movie from 2012 it's a major disappointment. I give it 4 stars because I like creature features, even SyFy originals, and it is better than any of the direct-to-video/made-for-TV movies I've seen. A direct-to-disc release would have turned it into a cult hit, instead of the flop it is now considered. Fans of this stuff should really give it a chance, but forget how recently it played in theaters.One thing's for sure, no one should be disappointed with the blu-ray transfer. The video quality is on par with most Hollywood blockbusters.",Spiders

257823,"Paul Newman made many memorable films during his long acting career. ""The Verdict"" is perhaps his best. Newman, in the role of Frank Galvin, a has-been, alcoholic attorney, is handed a case that no one seems to want. It involves a malpractice claim that a young couple are bringing on behalf of the wife's comatose sister. The hospital against which Newman brings the suit is represented by a powerful law firm and a top-notch defense attorney (played by James Mason) who will go to any lengths to win the case for his client.At first hesitant and unsure of himself, Galvin recognizes the justice of his cause, for it is evident to him that the hospital was grossly negligent in turning what should have been a routine operation into a tragedy that destroyed the life of a young woman. Galvin faces seemingly insurmountable odds. The judge mostly wants to get the case settled with as little difficulty as possible, and is greatly upset when Galvin refuses a settlement of $200,000 on behalf of his clients (of which his cut would have been approximately $70,000). To make matters worse, when Galvin's clients find out that he has refused this offer, because he recognizes it as grossly inadequate, they turn on him as well.Then, a woman (played by Charlotte Rampling) enters his life. Convinced that she is genuinely attracted to him, he takes her into his confidence, not recognizing that she is a plant by the defense.Despite all these setbacks, Galvin does not give up. He finally tracks down the only witness who can help him, a nurse who was on duty at the hospital on the crucial evening and who has the evidence to convict the hospital of negligence.Newman, supported by a great cast of actors, plays the part of Galvin perfectly, realistically, and convincingly. This is a movie definitely worth watching.",N/A
88831,"When my wife and I got engaged in '74, we went to Florida to visit my parents who were living there at the time. My cousin took us to see this new film that was the hot ticket. It was 'The Exorcist.' The theater was packed and I never forget how the audience freaked out during the scary scenes. I've never seen crowds react so strong to a horror film since then. We haven't seen the film in at least ten years so last night we watched the DVD of the Director's Cut which has ten extra minutes footage.So how has the film aged? Is it as scary as before? The special effects aren't as sophisticated as today's CGI but the film still packs a wallop due to the clever editing. You're on an emotional roller coaster ride while the suspense ebbs and flows as the story gradually builds with each possession scene of increasing intensity until the final confrontation between good and evil. The extra footage has the originally deleted famous spider walk included and more doctor scenes and more of the detective at the end. There are no extras except for the Director's Commentary and a trailer unlike previous editions but I really can't complain for $5.The video shows a lot of grain when upscaled to 1080P but this probably due to the film stock of the time. I've read the Blu-ray version still has too much grain but the overall picture is better. Surround sound effects are minimal since the film was recorded in mono. There's a new Blu-ray coming out in October '13 so I'll wait to see if the grain situation has improved. Meanwhile I'll keep this one and wait for the reviews.

965601,"During the previous three Harry Potter films, a showdown between Harry Potter & Dark Lord Voldemort was always hinted at but never quite fully conceived.  In ""Goblet of Fire"", however, that confrontation does indeed finally take place and vaults the series to new heights.For a basic plot summary, ""Goblet"" begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), & Hermoine (Emma Watson) attending the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasley family.  While at the Cup, the Dark Mark of Voldemort appears in the sky along with a series of attacks on the crowd..  Thus, when the trio report to their fourth year at Hogwarts, it is with an air of caution and suspicion.  This is no normal semester at wizarding school, however, as the Tri-Wizard tournament is revived for the first time in ages, allowing the Hogwarts house to see students from other wizarding academies.  As the competitions begin, Harry (as usual) plays a key role in the proceedings, as well as the search for Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) followers.In terms of spectacular visuals, the fantastic aspects of the Tri-Wizard tournament make this film a perfect vehicle to really showcase some impressive special effects...which it takes full advantage of.  ""Goblet"" is a visual treat to observe and really makes it feel as if you are completely immersed in the Potter universe.In keeping with the book, the character development and drama only amps up in this installment.  The scenes at the Wizard Ball provide more insight than ever into the relationships between our favorite protagonists, while the big confrontation between Harry and the Dark Lord is absolutely riveting and almost steals the show in and of itself.  A better actor than Fiennes could not have been cast for the role, as he truly is a frightening sight to behold.Overall, ""Goblet of Fire"" (like its novel namesake) is the best installment of the franchise so far.  It perfectly combines adventure, drama, characters, music, and even some lighter moments to create a nice entertaining mixture.  A few plotlines from the book are excised completely, but other than that there isn't anything else to criticize here.",N/A

461200,"Shekar's Elizabeth compresses many years of Queen Elizabeth's reign into an apparently short time, and changes some events for dramatic effect. The result is a stunning spectacle of Elizabethan life and politics that simplifies and sometimes deviates from history, but is never dull. For example, Mary of Guise, Regent of Scotland and mother of Elizabeth's nemesis, Mary Queen of Scots, was not seduced and killed by Walsingham. She died of dropsy. Of course, showing the grotesquely swollen body of someone with dropsy would have had a very different cinematic  effect than the sight of slender and lovely Fanny Ardant. And William Cecil was not retired by the young Elizabeth so she could run her own affairs. He was only 38 at Elizabeth's coronation (unlike the octogenarian actor who portrays him in the film) and continued to be her most trusted adviser on the privy council for 40 years until he died, and was succeeded by his son, Robert Cecil.But perhaps the greatest deviation of the film from history is its portrayal of Elizabeth's favorite, Robert Dudley, as a shallow boy toy. The real Robert Dudley was tall and athletic and an expert jouster. His main attraction for Elizabeth, however, was his mind. Like Elizabeth, he had a classical education, and was fluent in French and Italian. But he also studied science and mathematics, was a brilliant conversationalist, and (most important) could make her laugh. In the HBO miniseries, Elizabeth I, Jeremy Irons portrays Robert Dudley and his relations with Elizabeth (played by Helen Mirren) much more accurately. Good as the miniseries is, though, one can't help thinking that sometimes Shekar's film (in the spirit of Thucidides) shows us what people should have said and done (rather than what they actually said and did), because it would have made better drama.",N/A

When his wife Renai (Byrne) questions what happened she notices a change in Josh. This change begins to effect the entire family and when a group arrives to help the family begins to experience the terror over again. I have stated that it takes a lot to scare me. I'm not saying that to brag I'm just saying that very few movies have scared me. The three that come to mind are Poltergeist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and the first Insidious. That said I was hesitant to see this one because I was worried I would be scared again. On the plus side I wasn't scared at all, on the down side I wasn't entertained by this movie either. The first one was scary to me because of the possession of the little boy and creepy kids scare me a lot. Without trying to give too much away this movie was almost the same thing as the first one but this time Josh was possessed, and because it was an adult acting that way it didn't have the same effect on me. It felt just like another possession movie. I will say that this is still much better then most horror movies that come out but this is no where as good as the first one. Overall, yet another sequel that falls short of its predecessor. I give it a B-.",N/A

482135,"Others have commented on just how greatly this deviates from Austen's 'Mansfield'. 'Mansfield Park' may be the most difficult of Austen's novels to adapt, but Rozema did not adapt it so much as hijack it as a pro-feminist, anti-slavery rant in Regency costume. Rozema indeed deviates by making deviates of several characters: Sir Thomas is a sadistic bully who verbally abuses Fanny and rapes his slaves, Lady Bertram is an opium addict,  and Mary Crawford borders on being a sexual predator who has no moral compass. Rozema's 'Fanny Price' is exactly the opposite of Austen's 'Fanny', and not in any way that improves upon JA's. Rozema's 'Fanny' is arrogant, smug,condescending, judgmental and more than a little conniving. Many have said JA's 'Fanny' is her most difficult character to like; I found Rozema's impossible to like. Hardest to stomach after the politicization is Fanny's contempt for her birth family during her enforced 'visit' to Portmouth. She looks down her nose at their struggle and poverty, and exudes an air of ""I'm just soooo above all this.""Why watch it at all? The cinematography is lush and the costuming lovely. I watch this Henry Crawford and could believe he might just really love Fanny, not this Fanny but JA's Fanny.  Jonny Lee Miller's 'Edmund' is my favorite among 'Mansfield' adaptations, and in Frances Price (Fanny's mother) you see the beautiful woman who married for love and now regrets that childish decision. Unfortunately none of that helps 'Mansfield' rise above it's shortcomings as an adaptation.As a period piece 'Mansfield Park' has a certain attraction, and can stand on its own rather well. It simply has little merit as an Austen adaptation.",Mansfield Park VHS

429608,"I've seen this film a couple of times, and I've also seen ""Without Limits"" a couple of times as well.  While I'm giving this film a 4, that 4 is with some severe caveats, as that other finer film has shown how good a sport movie about running can be.  In reality, I believe that ""Prefontaine"" is really a 3.5.I hated the way that this film started as a pseudo-documentary.  I think that that was a huge tactical mistake, probably like taking the lead with four laps left in the 5000.  While I'm not much of a runner, it appears that Steve Prefonaine perhaps made this mistake himself at the 1972 Olympics, and I needed a nice little simile, so that one seemed to work.But once you sprint past the first act, the director seemed to run away from this documentary feel and I think that was a good idea.  From what I remember, ""Without Limits"" didn't concentrate as much on the tragedy of the Olympics in Germany, and that was probably a smart move as well.  While those Olympics were surely important from at least an historical perspective, I'm not exactly convinced that what happened there -- at least to the Israelis -- was as important to Mr. Prefontaine as this film seemed to portray.  But naturally, I could be wrong there; probably only his friends really know.For me, I think that the biggest difference between the two films was the head coach role.  While I've always been a fan of R. Lee Ermey -- and I thought that he did a good job here -- I just liked Donald Sutherland's portrayal better in ""Without Limits.""  Mr. Sutherland just seemed more natural, more laid back and philosophical to me, kind of like a Phil Jackson type.Still, a pretty good film, especially if you are a Prefontaine fan.  (I'm only a minor fan myself.)  My recommendation though:  watch this one first, and then catch ""Without Limits.""  That way you won't nitpick as much when watching this lesser film, and will be saving the best for the last lap.",Prefontaine VHS

This is one of the most addictive series I have viewed.The premise is great: Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) is promised the Secretary of State position in thanks for helping to get a new president elected.  Once elected, the new president conveniently changes his mind and doesn't even bother to meet with Underwood to tell him.  He lets his chief of staff notify Underwood he has been passed over, and asks for his continued support of the president in the Congress as Majority Whip.  Underwood promises his support, but lets us, the audience, know differently.Now the fun begins.  The joy of this series is seeing how Underwood continually outwits and outmaneuvers other politicians who seem just as integrity-challenged as him, but less bright.  And because Underwood has been skewered by the Prez and his team, you really don't mind when Underwood acts in a Machiavellian manner to get the better of them.Kevin Spacey is mesmeric as Frank Underwood.

1605666,"As the bringer of solutions where a pleasant outcome always prevails Grizzly Adams shows are not only reassuring but mighty entertaining as well.This second season as the first one was, based on a stirring message of appreciation and respect for Mother Earth and its many creatures, is a total ecological and drama success.The story of Grizzly Adams includes an educational message of respect for all of nature and its cute creatures, actually these shows are as a cold shower, the opposite of what is termed so-called reality; competition, greed, toxic waste, etc; all in disregard for Mother Earth, and its creatures including other humans.Then we have Denver Pyle, or Mad Jack, as the second dog on the show who delivers an amusing routine worthy of an Emmy award.  Jack obviously enjoys putting up a rough front yet behind that roughness we can see there is a gentle, caring man.These great televisions series, based on the life of a real nineteen century woodsman who found refuge from civilization in the Sierra Nevada mountains and who also raised and trained Grizzly bears and other wild animals, are highly recommended.",N/A

362172,"A gritty, realistic and hilarious look at Dublin working class life in the late 1980s based on the novel by Roddie Doyle. When twenty-year old Sharon Curley (Tina Kellegher) informs her father, Desi , and mother, Kay (Ruth McCabe) that she's ""up the pole"", they aren't thrilled, but there's no display of histrionics. After asking who the father is (and not being told), Desi invites his daughter out to the local pub for a drink. Sharon's friends are as interested as her family in the father's identity, but she resolutely keeps mum about the truth until an event in the neighborhood brings it into the open. It turns out that the father was her friend Yvonne's father George Burgess (Pat Laffan) , who took advantage of her while she was drunk. Sharon tells everyone that it was a Spanish sailor, to avoid the embarrassment and the shame of everybody knowing. However most of the town believe the truth. She is often criticized and made fun of because of Burgess being the father. Because of the incident, Burgess runs away from home, and Sharon quits her job as a shelf stacker.What makes this movie a classic is the robust humour, the working class conflict and loyalties, the family dynamics, prejudice and sexismbut it is how the Curley family comes together that conquers all as well as the general strength of character of Sharon and the loyalty of her best friend Jackie (Fionnuala Murphy).It captures late 1980s Irish working class culture in the same way that Angela's Ashes captures 1930s and 40s Irish working class culture.But with some really uproarious infectious humour, with gusto and without a dull moment.One of my best things about the movie is its theme song being I Cant Stop Falling In Love With You by Lick The Tins, my favourite version of the song-I love that song!A 1990s Irish classic",The Snapper VHS
151567,"Sometimes reviewers need to rid their minds of their knowledge of a film's production history and approach it on its own terms. This is certainly the case for Joseph L. Mankiewicz's GUYS AND DOLLS, which was beset by problems arising from the antipathy between Sinatra and Brando in the leading male roles. The finished product turns out surprisingly good, not least because there are few sequences in which these two actors appear on their own. They are part of an outstanding ensemble in which many of the stars of the original Broadway production (Vivian Blane, Stubby Kaye) recreate their roles. Jean Simmons offers a winning interpretation of Sarah Brown although her songs are dubbed. Designer Oliver Smith creates a surreal yet haunting world of Runyoneseque New York, full of small shops with Expressionist facades, iconic mid-Fifties automobiles and passers-by thronging the streets. The costumes are both colorful yet indicative of an underworld where outward show mattered as much as honoring one's marker. These guys might have been small-timers but they were proud of their images. Brando is surprisingly good as Sky Masterson; he brings a Method Actor's sensibility to the role, which means that each gesture matters, even during his songs. Sinatra doesn't do much, even though he has a song especially written for him. The stand-out performances come from Blaine and Kaye; their interpretations are just definitive. For lovers of the Broadway version, Skip Martin's orchestrations of the Loesser score are perhaps a little too lush; and the arrangement of Kaye's classic &#34;Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat&#34; is just too speedy, preventing from appreciating the sheer brilliance of the lyrics. On the other hand Michael Kidd's choreography is truly miraculous - a riot of color, energy and subtlety.",N/A

1185651,"First, the show:If you like fifties crime shows or retro tv, this is a must-have! Imagine ""Dragnet"" with (much) more testosterone, more action, (much) more bloodshed, and a faster pace. Throw in unusual camera angles, great dime detective novel-type dialogue, and an actor (Lee Marvin) who acts as if he was born to play the part of the tough and overworked Chicago detective to beat all Chicago detectives and you get ""M Squad."" There's plenty to distinguish this show from the many crime shows that were broadcast in the fifties: for one thing, there's violence - bloody violence. When someone gets in a car wreck (episode one), we see the very mangled cars and the bloody passengers inside the wreckage (anyone used to the sanitized crime shows of the fifties may be surprised at the realism of M Squad). Then there's the dozens of telling details that are thrown in that make this show special. At one point in episode one, Marvin is discussing the crime with another officer. A very buxom woman strolls by for a very brief moment. She walks by so fast and so close to the camera that we don't even see her face. Without missing a beat or a word of the conversation, Marvin's cold hungry eyes are pulled to the woman's attributes and follow her (them) until she is out of view. It only takes a second (and you will miss it if you aren't paying attention), but that small detail lets us know a lot about Marvin's character: he's virile and lusty underneath all that tough cop hide. We're only 15 minutes into the show and Marvin's character is already a fully developed, three-dimensional figure, There are dozens of small revealing details like that in M Squad that took time to think of and work into the script.Now on to the audio/video:It's not as bad as some of the reviews here suggest. Some of the audio is muddy in places (and Lee Marvin tends to be gravel-voiced to begin with), but I could understand everything. It sure isn't digital audio, though! The video is dark in places on some episodes. It's disappointing that this is so, but everything is watchable.

Though the role of a womanizer has been done time and time again, Jake Gyllenhaal) does not overdo it and therefore makes his performance more believible and makes an audience root for him in the end...I'm assuming that was a goal of the filmmakers here.  Anne Hathaway plays a ""leading lady"" who is anything but a stereotypical leading lady.  Though she and Gyllenhaal's characters hook up, she has a mind of her own and uses it, something always worth seeing.  I have no doubt that her trips to Canada with senior citizens for cheap perscription drugs are based on something real, given our health care system.  I personally love the fact that their relationship is anything but stereotypical...I mean, how many films have you seen that show a person having a panic attack during the same scene where they say ""I love you""?  But ultimately, I enjoy the film's portrayal of someone with an incurrible illness and the challenges they face, including the possibility of a relationship so many today take for granted.  It's another one of those romantic comedies that stays down to Earth and shows us what is really possible if we want it bad enough.  I have to credit the actors for this, though I'm told the director did a fair amount of anicdotal things to help them accomplish their performances, so hats-off to Edward Zwick.

Plus she was crying or upset in every scene.The ending was terribly written to basically give you a hollywood ending.There was no dramatic suspense, tons of plot holes, and no character development.No moral of the story.Michael's performance was the only reason i didn't turn it off early.Plot twist example:Shia's mentor commits suicide due to the financial collapse of his company at the hands of a competitor. Shia gets some revenge by tanking the competitor's stock. What does the bad guy do? He offers Shia a job of course, then screws Shia over. Shia then goes to get revenge again. Seeing a pattern of trust, betrayal, revenge here? Because it is the same approach between Shia and the daughter, Shia and Gecko, Gecko and the daughter, Shia and his mentor, The mentor and the competitor, etc..To be honest, i am not going to waste more of my time reviewing this movie...it was that disappointing.

To induce a reaction that I can't control. There's a scene where a machete goes through a wall and on the way out, it drags on someone's limb. Pretty obvious what they were doing, but I found myself saying ""guhwaaaaahh!"" and cringing.Acting was solid. I enjoyed that this movie only used the original as a rough guideline and there were plenty of nods and similarities in any case. I wish there was more information about the necronomicon. But maybe there will be more films.My only beef***SPOILER INCOMING***)is that the main character has almost no development in the movie. Also, while I do believe in strong female characters, why did we have to ruin the Evil dead series by making the junkie sister the survivor? There are plenty of movie already out there that are pro-female without having to destroy a franchise? I knew something was weird when the guy you think is the new Bruce Campbell didn't seem as much the focus as you think he'd be. The way this was done was kind of off-putting as in the end no one in movie was memorable. If you wanted the girl to live, you should have developed her throughout the movie so I'd care. She's fighting for her life and I'm busy being stunned and shocked that she's the last one left. I have a theory about this, however.So at the end of the movie you are left without any real investment in the ""main character. You sit there, stunned; wondering what WTF is going on. Credits roll. Then there is talking and at the end of the credits you see a familiar face. Hell Yea! I honestly hope this was just a chapter and not a true ""reboot"".",N/A

803689,"What makes Firestarter such a treat to watch is that the concept itself is extremely appealing so I was totally prepared for an awesome movie (which it is).  It's about Drew Barrymore's character being able to start fires when becoming angry enough, and her father with the ability to alter things occur with his mind.  The two of them being together creates really frightening and dangerous results.The first half is about Drew and her father running away from the government and trying to hide as much as possible while keeping a low profile, and the second half is when the government eventually captures them and they try to find ways to escape when it's realized the people they're dealing with have bad intentions in store for them.  A really surprising ending- at least, I didn't see it coming.  The final 10 minutes are AWESOME to watch.Perhaps I could complain that once the two are caught, there's a fair bit of uneventfulness between Drew and the ""cleaning guy"" (you'll see what I mean) though for storyline reasons, these segments are pretty much mandatory.  Also the father's special abilities don't occur as often as Drew's so the father feels slightly underutilized.  Another small complaint.Considering the year is 1984, I'm not really a fan of early 80's films.  However knowing Stephen King is the one responsible for such a terrific concept and storyline, I have no problem watching one of his films *regardless* the year it was released.I love how the father continues to stress to Drew Barrymore the importance of not getting angry so she doesn't accidentally create any regrettable mistakes that could harm her and/or her father.  This is an emotional piece of writing here.  Also, wow, Drew was a really adorable and smart kid wasn't she?  Being so innocent with such a deadly fire-starting ability makes the movie even more exciting.Overall, Stephen King is the master of horrror and weirdness for a reason- a movie like Firestarter is just superb.

1640998,"And those who can't teach, teach gym.  That's from Woody Allen, and maybe it's too bad that he didn't direct this movie.  It's a send-up of Middle-American morality, but it never succeeds in becoming anything more than a pleasant little film.I invoked the overused cliche for my review title because that's the well from which this little drama springs.  It is the thwarted desires of the English teacher (Julianne Moore) and the drama teacher (Nathan Lane) which drive them to produce the corny, but mildly promising script by the former student (and spoiled brat) played by Michael Angarano.  The play in question is called ""The Chrysalis"", which in itself is kind of a corny metaphor for high school.... the place which is supposed to incubate successes (and largely produces failures.)  Michael Angarano's ""Jason"" appeals to the deeply ingrained sense of inferiority in his former teachers... and at one point, he honestly reveals his contempt for them, to Moore's character.  By that point, Moore's English teacher is experiencing an unrelenting fall from grace largely because of Jason's manipulations.Moore and Lane are basically what makes this film watchable, and Moore in particular.  She is excellent in her comedic portrayal of a repressed (but still attractive) middle-aged woman who is a victim of her own politically correct nature.  In fact Moore is so good, she will probably remind you of at least one person that you know.This movie reminded me of both ""Waiting For Guffman"" and ""Election"" in its close to the bone portrayals of small town personalities, and high school viciousness.  But it never rises to the level of ""Guffman"", which is absolutely hilarious.  ""The English Teacher"" is a film, like its subject, that remains trapped by its own primness and lack of ambitions.",The English Teacher

1000544,"I went into this film without having seen the musical. Ultimately, what I found was a strong, very moving motion picture with some terrific songs. Performances are strong, especially from Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe (I thought his singing was fine).The biggest quibbles I have of the film are over its direction and constant singing. Nearly the entire movie is sung through, which can make for a trying experience, especially during the film's slow spots. As mentioned constantly in the film's press and marketing, the film had the actors singing live on set as the cameras rolled. This works to underlie the emotions of the characters during the big musical numbers, but it works less well for when the actors have to sing their dialogue. It's often tuneless and flat, even from a great singer like Jackman! The film's director Tom Hooper likes to shoot his movies with fish-eye lenses and unconventional framing. Personally, I felt these were often distracting and distasteful, again, especially during the slow moments of the story. As things get going though, they're less of an issue.The movie presents a deeply moving story of one man's journey of redemption, which unfortunately gets sidelined during the second half for a thin and predictable love story. Still, it comes together quite nicely. The last hour or so is terrifically stirring and many of the big musical numbers are well done.Picture quality is solid and the the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio is very dynamic. Both accurately reproduce the theatrical experience. Extras aren't plentiful but solid. There's a good hour-long documentary, an additional featurette on Hugo's original novel, and a commentary from the director which I chose not to listen to.

1486227,"Ang Lee does it again with this tale of a young man and his survival of a shipwreck only to be trapped on a lifeboat with a live tiger. I must admit that I am not at all familiar with the book, so I bring no book-laden expectations to the film. I saw this film strictly on the basis of a few trailers I saw that intrigued me. I love the visual splendor of the tiger, and the menace of the tiger at close quarters was absolutely terrifying. The great cosmic meaning of the film may have escaped me, but I  was transfixed at the sight of this beautiful and deadly beast and the young man playing a cat and mouse game with him in the lifeboat. I was well entertained, and am not worried if I should have had a profound insight and did not. The film is like a moving breathing work of art, and it captured my attention for every minute of it's length, which is something that I can't say about many films these days.

1072057,"I loved The Host when I saw the theatrical release on DVD, in the original Korean with English subtitles. BUT BEWARE: this dubbed version does have the Korean soundtrack available, but it has NO English subtitles available (despite the fact that the Amazon page says it has both English and Spanish subtitles)!As with most dubbed movies, this dubbing is truly awful, sucking all the drama and humor out of the movie. I can understand including a dubbed version for 1) the educationally-challenged who can't stand to (or are unable to) read subtitles, 2) the culturally-challenged who can't stand listening to foreign languages, or 3) the artistically-challenged who don't understand how much is lost when the voices of the real actors are replaced by Grade-F ""voice talents"" with no acting ability.What I can't understand is why they would arbitrarily delete the English subtitles from this version. They already had them on the previous version, so what does it cost to include them here?One other note about this version: it's almost an hour longer than the theatrical version. This is good and bad, mostly bad. About half the extra material is worth watching, even thought it screws-up the pace of the movie.

1578005,"I was shopping the five-dollar bargain DVD bin at Wal-Mart and came across this four-movie collection starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Well, I  don't recall seeing any Van Damme movies in the past, but I was certainly aware of him as an acclaimed actor. As such, I bought the four-movie set for late-night viewing. I only watched two of the movies, ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" and ""Knock Off. "" They were awful movies and I gave them each a 2-star rating. You can look up my reviews, if you like. I was not out of line. Other reviewers also saw the movies as dubious offerings.Well, now I've got two more movies left on my DVD, ""The Hard Corps"" and ""Second in Command."" This time I went  to the ratings first. Both are low rated. Well, should I waste my time watching them? I think not. There are many other quality movies to watch. I can't figure this. Van Damme's other movies are well thought of and there's plenty of them. He evidently has a large legion of fans. Yet, these movies must be the dregs of his career bundled together in one collection. Well, it's only five dollars so you can't lose much. True, but you lose your  viewing time. Unless you're a died-in-the-wool Van Damme fan who has to view everything, I'd skip this anemic collection and opt for some of his better films.Gary Peterson",Universal Soldier: The Return/Knock Off/Second In Command/The Hard Corps - 4-Pack

657823,"Good Luck Chuck(2007) is a vulgar, mean, idiotic ""romantic comedy"" starring Dane Cook and Jessica Alba. The first hour is jam packed with nudity and soft core sex scenes! It also has its share of romantic comedy cliches. The film casually pokes fun of Asian people, religion and fat women! Even leading lady Jessica Alba criticized the film. The film's trailer did a good job hiding most of the vulgarity in the movie. Good Luck Chuck exploited a lot of talented people. The film has a ""surreal tone"" as a bitter ""Goth girl"" puts a hex on Charlie/Chuck. There's a Good Luck Chuck movie poster that spoofed John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The film fails to make Charlie a character that we could like. The movie also sends an irresponsible message as dozens of women in the story have carefree, casual sex with Charlie! The film makes phony attempts to tug at our heartstrings.Good Luck Chuck starts off on a bad note with 12 year old children talking to eachother about sex at a party. Did the parents of these child actors read the script? Hollywood starlets Alba and Chelan Simmons do their best in the film even though they're stuck with a bad script. Some people like this film!

However, this movie (House of Flying Daggers) is a very close second on my list of great action martial art movies. You can see the professionalism in this fantastic film because it was made by the same Director of Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon.This gem has everything you might desire in an Asian martial arts movie.  The cast is absolutely wonderful (Ziyi Zhang, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Andy Lau). The dance scene at the beginning of this film is one of the most beautiful parts of the film. The fight scenes are nothing short of fantastic.  The story moves along at a fast pace and this is a movie that I have watched several times(twice at the show and twice after buying the DVD) because it is that good.In conclusion, there is nothing more that I can add that has not already been written about from other reviewers; nevertheless, this movie is so fantastic that I just had to also comment on it with this short review.

832632,"Le Coq d'Or, or the Golden Cockerel, was the last opera by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which he completed in 1907. Based on a story by Pushkin, it tells of a foolish king who brings grief to himself and his people by incompetent prosecution of a war. The golden cockerel of the title is a magical bird that warns of impending peril for the kingdom. The bird's warning could have been for Rimsky himself, because his opera's intentional parallels with the history of the disastrous Russo-Japanese War of 1905 were too plainly evident to the Tsarist censors. Consequently the opera was not performed until after Rimsky's death in 1908, and even then only in a severely edited version.This production is international in every sense of the word: A Russian opera performed in France by a largely Russian cast, with staging and costumes by a master of the Japanese Kabuki tradition, and music performed by the Orchestre de Paris. The orchestral suite from Le Coq d'Or is widely available and well-loved, and those already familiar with it will get added enjoyment from the opera. The singing is very well done, the music is delightful, and the fabulous and colorful costumes are resplendent.Video quality is the only reservation I have about this presentation. Most shots are very sharp and clear, befitting a Blu-ray transcription. The narrow shots are invariably sharp, but some of the medium shots and many of the wide shots appear to have been filmed in standard definition rather than HD.  This is especially jarring in the numerous instances where a cut is made from a tight shot to a wide shot or vice-versa, and the contrast in resolution is thereby emphasized. The difference is so obvious that I am surprised it was not commented on by more reviewers. Aside from these technical anomalies the video is oftentimes startlingly beautiful.Rimsky-Korsakov is often considered by modern critics to be second-tier among the Russian composers. He faced such criticism in his lifetime as well, with one Viennese critic saying his very name conjured up visions of ""fierce whiskers stained with vodka."" Personally, I regard Rimsky as one of my favorite composers, and therefore enjoyed seeing a long-admired piece of music brought to life as it originated, in an opera.","Rimsky-Korsakov - Le Coq d'Or / Schagidullin, Levinsky, Breus, Bannik, Manistina, Banks, Nagano, Chatelet Opera"

555297,"How on earth did Orson Welles ever end up in a dud like this?  I mean... I can hear Welles's magnificent voice coming from what's meant to be King Saul but the makeup he's wearing says bloated, window-peeper.  I'd categorize David and Goliath more on the side of cheesy sword & sandal rather than biblical epic and given the genre It's more than a bit distracting when they try to treat Holy Scripture like Shakespeare; in fact the screenplay sounds like something from an amateur church pageant (thee's and thou's flow like cheap wine).Apparently the director thought a story loosely based on scripture and lavish sets would carry throwing together a group of actors, ranging from legendary to lame, and having them just recite their lines.  Hilton Edwards, the veteran of so many religious and historical films, plays the prophet Samuel but unfortunately looks more like one of those big, slow-moving muppets from the Dark Crystal, randomly quoting unrelated clips of scripture like some sort of a nickel-operated fortune-telling machine.  Listening to the characters David and Eglah (sounding like corny dialogue from bad anime) I almost giggled when she was struck by lightning which just goes to show how detached I was from this terrible film.  Goliath (the main antagonist and half of the title) is obviously a person in a body suit from a distance and a furry, sweaty sort-of caveman close up and his sidekick Cret (meant to be the only comic relief) reminds me more of a goofy claymation character.The real tragedy of this movie is that it obviously had a decent budget but I can't emphasize enough how lame it is overall and the poor transfer quality makes it even more difficult to watch.  It's not my intention to be irreverent with this review, I just think such a beloved story deserves better treatment not to mention that Amazon will usually list this stinker in the recommendations when looking up true religious classics like The Robe, Ben-Hur, Quo-Vadis, etc.  :o)",N/A

1604858,"For 38 years the original Carrie has remained one of the greatest horror movies ever made, a shining example of not only how to adapt a book into a movie, but also how to make you....Fear, so it was inevitable that a remake would be made.To not compare this film to the original is impossible. Brian De Palma's version is an immersive experience, a psychological assault on the mind, you feel what Carrie White feels. Chloe Grace Moretz is an incredible actress, but her Carrie doesn't quite project her fears and emotions into us like Sissy Spacek's did.In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie, the mother(played by Julianne Moore) nearly lacks the controlling dominance the original had over Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz's Carrie right from the start doesn't hardly fear her mother, but instead shes defiant towards her, hates her, and this is what separates this new Carrie from the original. Brian De Palma's Carrie FEARS and Kimberly Peirce's Carrie HATES.For the most part the majority of the middle of this film plays out almost identically to that of De Palma's, the actors are the only real difference. Some of the new actors are good and some are just terrible, like Judy Greer(Miss Desjardin / the P.E. teacher), she sounds so week and juvenile when shes speaking her lines it's hard to take her seriously as an authority figure.Lets fast forward to the prom scene. In Brian De Palma's Carrie after winning prom queen and king Carrie and Tommy Ross head up to the stage, this scene is gloriously shot in slow motion, eventually the blood gets poured on her and she goes into a state of absolute shock, the only sound that can be heard is the bucket swaying back and forth, then the bucket falls and hits Tommy in the head knocking him unconscious, in her state She takes no notice of whats happened to Tommy as the overwhelming fear that has enveloped her causes her to lose control unleashing her powers on all her school mates. In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie...well lets face it, the prom scene lacks the build up of the original, no slow motion, no sounds of a swaying bucket, how this scene was shot by De Palma is what made the original so fantastic. Kimberly Peirce's Carrie somewhat figures out how to control her powers, unlike De Palma's who's powers mainly activated out of fear. This time when the blood is poured on her head she doesn't go into shock, instead she nearly walks off stage before turning around after Tommy is hit by the bucket. This pushes her emotions over the edge and in a fully aware state of mind she unleashes her powers on her class mates.I personally feel nothing for Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie, it may have followed the plot of the book a little closer in some areas, but it did it with far less sophistication. It has some unique changes that make it worth a watch, but ultimately it doesn't come close to the brilliance of the original.",Carrie

There's just one problem - there's an authoring error that puts a few seconds of one scene in the middle of another.  At about 18 minutes in as Dudley is trying to decide what to do with all of the donation letters he has, the image suddenly switches to a previous scene where Dudley and the professor are looking at the bishop's old church.  The audio continues on as if the other scene isn't there, but the image is wrong.  This lasts for about three seconds, then it returns to the right visuals.

764549,Watchers isn't a classic but has many fun moments. I'm not quite sure how it managed to be rated R because it is fairly tame. The movie is about a mutant who goes psychotic placing a dog and his new family in danger. It is based on a book by Dean Koontz. Corey Haim and Michael Ironside play their parts well. Jason Priestley even makes an appearance. The dog is fantastic in the film (assuming you are an animal lover). I prefer The Lost Boys but this movie is entertaining enough with plenty of kills and a light-hearted tone.Watchers II is almost a remake of Watchers.

It's a common theme in many similar films and to be honest, I didn't see anything here, that made this movie stand out from the rest of them. This is just another coming of age film without many surprises. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. The acting was OK, as was the pace of the film. I'm finding it really difficult to say anything positive or negative about White Irish Drinkers, because the truth is, it's just a simple, ordinary story that I've seen a hundred times before. The names and places always change, and there was a familiar face or two, but nothing about this film stands out positively or negatively in any way. It's just a very common type of story with a very ordinary cast. Everyone does their job and the story gets told, I don't know what you'll think, but my reaction to this film was simple neutrality.

1426259,"It was a really good movie although it is a 1955 film technology. From what has been written it is more realistic as the equipment used was circa 1945 and apparently was readily available. The James Caan movie (X-1) is more fictitious (Cowboys and Nazi's) where as the 1955 one is trying to depict the real story of the Tirpitz Operation. They did not say that the Tirpitz was sunk or not sunk, but there was a huge explosion. The Tirpitz was knocked out of commission for about 6 months. This film actually was much closer to the truth than was really known at the time as PBS did a later show of diving ""archaeologists"" who wanted to find out just what did happen based on locations and what was on the bottom of the Fiord where the operation took place. Their summation was that the 1955 film was quite accurate. The 1955 film probably had a benefit of interviews of people who were there and had a more recent memory of what happened without a lot of interpretation which can fog events.Those guys were brave, I wouldn't have dived with those suits. It's a small wonder that they wore heavy wool sweaters. Those subs had to have been cold. The average water temp in that area in September is 55 degrees. Yowee! That's pretty cold.

52276,"Let's cut to the chase - for while I'd love to wax rhapsodic about seeing this as a youngster in 1973, growing up listening the sound track, etc.:  the bottom line is, I want to help spread appropriate confidence to home theater buffs about the transfer quality.In short:  I feel it's a winner, based on my own viewing this week (Oppo player, Denon receiver, B&W; speakers, and still pretty amazing but older Sony LCD - a modest budget home theater system).  This viewing brought me sensually back to the original 1973 theatrical experience, much more than previous views of the 2004 DVD print of Jesus Christ Superstar (Special Edition) (1973).  I replayed a few segments of that DVD in comparison with this newly remastered Blu-Ray, as well.I'm dumbfounded to have seen several negative reviews on this same page by customers who felt the sound track was not only substandard but even, in their words, atrocious or bad.  It's not.  I heard and saw detail, richness, and balance that were well suited to a remastered 1973 release.  Colors were somewhat muted at times, but still popped.  The Blu-Ray lifted a visual fog that I hadn't even realized was present in the DVD.  And the audio rendition delivered a remarkably pleasing tonality, balance, and dynamic range, in my experience.  I heard layers that I was not previously aware with the DVD.My experience was echoed by the review at Blu-ray dot com which gave the film 3.5 /5 (video) and 4.0 / 5 (audio).This is not a 5.1 remix, though.  It's a faithful and pleasing presentation of the original 4 track stereo (DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0).Now, for the rest:  the casting, the score, performances and orchestration still blow me away, after all these years.... as does the clever theatrical presentation against the beautiful desert backdrop.  Cinematically, it's not intended to be a groundbreaking film; it's more conventional and uses a couple of dated visual techniques, but as a creature of its time, that isn't a bad thing.How can you go wrong with a well priced, well transferred, remastered classic?",N/A

1561196,"Man of SteelHenry Cavill was just as perfect a Superman as Christopher Reeves!  Prologue vignettes of Clark saving people before donning the suit were magnificent as well as his heroic self discipline not to abuse his powers akin to the newest (ie best) rendition of Amazing Spider-Man 2012.  However, the 20 minutes of wasted time during the fight scene to simply demonstrate special effects was a tedious waste of time akin to derailment that constituted Transformers 3 and Inception.  Hollywood still does not realize that action is fine if it fits the story as with Eagle Eye.  A believable Superman would have diverted Zod to the ocean or desert away from the urban populace to minimize risks to life and infrastructure assets.  We want a story, not crap action if action is pointless and noncontributory.Also, America consists of whites, blacks, Asians, latinos...  Normal Americans embrace that all law abiding citizens are equal.  Akin to Brad Pitt's boss in World Wide Z being black, Avengers re-written to make Nick Fury black, President and 2nd in command in 2012 being black, making the general black and colonel white while simultaneously rewriting comic lore for 70+ years to make Perry White a black is insulting as Hollywood pushes their agenda without cause.  We are all equal and if Hollywood truly believed this then they would not pander to solicit approval.  All of the black actors were fantastic and incredibly skilled but I tire of the unsolicited Hollywood repetative agenda.Finally, I encourage all viewers to embrace a one year boycott of all distracting advertising during movies that WE PAY TO VIEW as paying for advertising in the midst of our movies is insulting to the viewer and detracts from the continuity of enjoying the film.  IHOP was advertised no less than 3 times during the movie and Sears was distinctly advertised once with the camera fixated on the Sears logo. For one year from my 6/22/13 viewing I will refuse to enter IHOP or Sears such that companies realize that by submitting to maximizing Hollywood profits they will minimize their own profits by consensus public boycott.  We can teach Hollywood not to sacrifice the story line by intrusive inappropriate advertising.In conclusion, Man of Steel, if one ignores the wasteful protracted action fight scene, contrived ""need"" to terraform Earth despite the infinite planets accessible via the movie's hyperspace drive (see: contrived conflict between Zod and Kal El simply to justify combat action protracted event), redundant and unnecessary racial messaging, and inappropriate money hungry advertising, was great!If Director Snyder learns from his mistakes and keeps same actors for Clark and Lois with greater attention to the human component (the essence of science fiction) then I cannot wait for the sequel(s)!!!Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were so truly fantastic, however, that I have to grant 4 stars despite Snyder's questionable skills.",N/A

The routine became so ridiculous, rambling, incoherent and obnoxious that it's not at all enjoyable. It's almost as if he's making it up as he goes along.. He sounded like a bum on the street corner talking to himself.The first fifteen minutes was pointless and pretentious too. Fifteen minutes of him telling us he's bigger than he is because he toured Canada and parts of Europe..by bus.. and all of the black guys tell us that they hate being on the bus because they all stink and have bad body odor...I'm also getting tired of this double standard where certain people can use words that others can't use, and they use them as almost every other word.. and also use reverse racist language which others would never be able to get away with without a firestorm of controversy. It's old, it's annoying, it's uncalled for.. and it's not culture, it's just low class and shows a lack of intelligence and empathy.

1385365,"There's something irresistible about a fireplace.  It's warm, it's nice to look at, and there's something really pleasant about the sound of the fire and the wood popping.  Fireplace For Your Home is a DVD that recreates the visuals and sounds that come with fireplaces without all the hassle of buying wood or owning a fireplace.  The fire on this DVD is hypnotizing (as fires are), and the entirety of the fireplace takes up the television screen.  The crackling sounds are also recreated here, and you can clearly hear the wood pop and crack as it burns.  If you don't particularly like that sound, you can always turn the sound down.  If you've ever tried to turn down the volume on an actual fireplace, you will quickly become upset because that is a very silly thing to do.The classic version of Fireplace For Your Home comes with and without music.  At the title screen, you can choose either option.  I imagine that most viewers will opt for the version without music: the music on this DVD is inoffensive and relaxing, but it doesn't quite fit with the visuals.  The music feels like it could be found in an elevator or a hotel lobby -- it's nothing to concentrate on because it was created for the background.The DVD track of this fireplace is approximately 30 minutes long, and it starts while most of the wood is untouched.  By the end of the 30 minutes, most of the book is burned (and the popping sounds become less frequent) and the video loops right back to the beginning.  You can have this on for an indefinite amount of time, and it will only stop whenever you want it.When it comes down to it, whether or not you should buy this DVD (or rent it on Amazon Instant) boils down to one question: do you wish your television looked like a fireplace?  If you do, then this DVD is exactly what you would want in the sights and sounds that come with fireplaces.

1647826,"This movie starts off completely satisfying our need for a magic fix.  Quick, interesting stuff delivered by engaging and talented actors.  However, it all goes down the tube when our ""four horsemen"" meet in a run down apartment in New York City.  All of the subsequent ""magic"" is total nonsense delivered in a loud and over bearing manner.  Typical of the new Hollywood, CGI trumps style and content.  The plot line of the movie is so ridiculous you just want it to be over.  When the truth is revealed, it is even more ludicrous than nonsense that preceded it!  It makes you wonder if anyone actually watches the finished product.  Take my advice and pass on this dog!",N/A

619357,I love it!I could relate because of the times I traveled and experienced jet lag.  Often wandering an airport or hotel and surrounding area in the middle of the night.  Can't tell you how many books I finished because of jet lag.  Lost in Translation really gives you that middle of the night jet lag feelThe movie is quirky.  Honestly I have to wonder if this movie even gets made if not for the Coppola name.  The perfect movie to watch for those by themselves and experiencing jet lag.

891295,"Sort of a minimalist thriller. Camera work on the arty-but good-side. Baffling action, explained, but who can trust the explanations. Acting adapted to screenplay so not flashy but appropriate. Beware of film-if you like to know what is going on. Obscurity with apparent clarity is the goal of the filmmakers. I liked it, but it is not a film for everyone...sort of an Orson Welles approach without Orson's flair. That might sound like a knock but is not intended as such...the creators and actors adapt a somewhat offbeat mode but, mostly, succeed....if you have patience.",Cypher

Call me crazy in my ripe old age of 32, but the PG13 rating seemed off, not because it's too violent or there's too many swears, but because I think the content of the film will bore any kid.

1664976,"Written and directed by James Cullen Bressack who brought us &#8220;Hate Crime,&#8221; &#8220;To Jennifer,&#8221; and &#8220;My Pure Joy.&#8221;  Knowing and enjoying James&#8217; style, I anticipated a lot of insane moments and he didn&#8217;t let me down.&#8220;For millennia, calendars have added an extra day every four years. In doing so, they have violated the ancient Mayan calendar. Now, we are in the 13th month of the 13th year of the new millennium, and the few who survive will battle a world of demons.&#8221;  The demons basically have infected almost everyone and turned them into crazies.  The infected are insane killing machines, but they&#8217;re alive and not zombies.The sky was the limit for James to go ballistic and he sure did.  Horror movies like this are typically slash em up, but James added some fun characters to make the movie even more enjoyable and you may even snicker during some disturbing scenes.It begins with us meeting the guys on a camping trip.  When Jack (Trae Ireland) returns from the trip everything appears normal&#8230;..sort of.  His twelve year old daughter Kendra (Tiffany Martinez) smashes a spider in her hands and eats it.  His wife Marcy (Calico Cooper) is compulsively scratching all the skin off her arm.  Jack takes her the hospital and experiences the doctors acting all hard ass dropping F bombs left and right on him. Meanwhile back home, his daughter is in a heated and distressing argument with Jack&#8217;s friend Trevor (Bill Voorhees).  Spoiler, Kendra wins.It&#8217;s pretty whacky and disturbing in many ways and I have to admit funny at points.  Simple things, for example, Quentin (Jody Barton) and Joe (J. Scott) are sitting on the couch drinking beer and you can hear crunching of Trevor&#8217;s head being smashed on the concrete outside by Kendra, all while Quentin and Joe zone out watching TV.  In one scene Quentin stabs Joe and they laugh as if they smoked a pound of marijuana, and then laugh even harder when they smear his blood on the wall.  Quentin and Joe definitely are the Beavis and Butthead of psycho killers.Jack and Candace (Erin Coker) are the only sane people and meet in the hospital while the world around them is full of crazies.  They team up to escape the hospital and get to Jack&#8217;s house to save his daughter.  Yeah, the daughter who eats spiders and smashed a guy&#8217;s head on the concrete.The film maintains the insanity throughout as Jack and Candace struggle to make it to 13/14/13.  What would be more dangerous than &#8220;13/13/13&#8221;?  James Cullen Bressack and Jared Cohn teaming up to write &#8220;14/14/14&#8221;On the DVD be sure to check out the bonus features which includes a &#8220;Making Of&#8221; and &#8220;Gag Reel.&#8221;",N/A

742327,"Fruits Basket is a sweet and wonderful anime. It is based on the manga series by Natsuki Takaya.The show is about a girl named Tohru who goes to live with the Sohma family. She learns about the fact that the family are possessed by the spirits of the Chinese Zodiac. She learns that each family member turns into their zodiac animal if they are hugged by someone of the opposite sex, or if they are under great stress. But Tohru's presence becomes a positive influence on the family.Some of my favorite characters in this show are:Tohru: She is one of the sweetest anime characters I can think of. She will do anything for anyone and she loves to make people happy. She is sweet, optimistic, and understanding. Tohru is a wonderful character.Kyo: He is a cat and he becomes best friends with Tohru, but in the anime, it is hard to tell who likes Tohru better, him or Yuki. Kyo had a rough childhood, and he was rejected by many people until he met his trainer who took him in and taught him martial arts. Kyo's hard childhood made him short-tempered. He gets angry easily and he can be a bully. A lot of people don't like him and are afraid of him because of his intimidating personality. He sometimes bullies his cousin Momiji whenever he makes silly comments about him and Tohru, but it's always done in a funny and goofy way. He can also be really shy, and he goes through a lot in the show. He is the character in this show who is often under the most stress.Yuki: He is a rat and he likes Tohru. He is the pretty boy of the school and everyone finds him attractive, but he has low self esteem because of what he went through as a child. He and Kyo despise each other because of their signs.Shigure: He is a dog and a goofy person, He is also a novelist, and he often puts his editor through a lot of stress by ignoring his deadlines for his novels.Momiji: He is an adorable and sweet boy the same age as Hatsuharu. He is a rabbit, and he always dresses in girl's clothes. He becomes close with Tohru, even asking her if she wants to be his friend the first time they meet. He is smart and he tries to cheer people up similar to Tohru. He sometimes cracks jokes about Kyo and Tohru, which makes Kyo angry and causes Momiji to get bullied by him.This is a really sweet show with wonderful morals. Tohru is so sweet and optimistic, and she does anything to make people happy. There are a lot of characters and we learn a lot about every character. It also has a lot of emotional scenes and the last 2 episodes are really dramatic. The show has a wonderful happy ending where Tohru brings out the real emotions of the villain. We learn about what the villain went through as a child that caused him to be so cruel and mean. But the show is not entirely about the villain, who we don't see much of anyway. The show is about friendship and understanding. It also has morals about family problems, bullying, and sexual preferences. It's an amazing anime series that anybody should see at least once.",Fruits Basket - Volume 4: The Clearing Sky

Believe it or not, it is, and it's so different from the mostly serious, technical, precise, and oftentimes subdued atmosphere that has become the Star Trek universe. So, what was on Nimoy's mind here? Was he hearing the voices of a new generation of potential fans who were saying that Star Trek is too boring, bland, or anemic? In a bold move, he co-writes a script that has the viewer laughing so often, they wonder if this movie should be in the comedy genre. This movie is simply refreshing, as it portrays the characters in a totally different light, especially Spock. He is simply hilarious in this movie. And the plot: Well, it's Star Trek, so the plot is going to be quirky, but WHALES? Wow, this is REALLY different, but nevertheless sparks ones curiosity.

I thought the acting was good, it was shot well and the action scenes with Kal El and General Zod were very good. A lot of cgi used in this film, but how else do you show super beings who move super fast and fly and throw cars/pickups about, crash thru buildings and wreak havoc without injury to themselves. On Blu-ray the video and audio are great. Well worth getting. The extra are good too, especially the segment with Antje Traue ,Michael Shannon and Henry Cavill working out to build Kryptonion physique's.

A job well done by Olive. Unfortunately there aren't any new extras and even one seemed to get dropped all together (Maureen O'Hara interview).

We went from blue on white to blue on black. It still looks pretty neat, but I would have liked to see some transition. Maybe even some older programs still in service. It was not to be. In some ways I still preferred the older suits. The new ones were almost completely dark.In the first Tron, Kevin Flynn had ""magic"" powers due to being a User. I was kind of glad to see this subdued somewhat. Now, he uses his system knowledge instead.Also in the original, Kevin Flynn was good at the games because he was good at video games. But this doesn't work so well in the sequel. Sam Flynn is good at the games... why? Not because he has any experience with them. But only because he has become Generic Action Hero Guy! I don't know what to think about that.I liked how Kevin Flynn had aged. I also liked the awkward Father / Son relationship, which I could certainly relate to. I felt like the acting there was spot on. It was meant to be awkward, with two people who were worlds apart. With nothing to talk about really, but with still a deep love underneath. I got that, and I thought it was well done.Some criticize Garrett Hedlund's acting in this, but I thought he did a great job. I had no problem with Sam Flynn as a character. Olivia Wilde was good, too. And Jeff Bridges, as usual, really shined. He was awesome.I've read some criticism that somewhere between Tron and Tron: Legacy, Kevin Flynn became ""The Dude"" from The Big Lebowsky. I couldn't disagree more. They both have a beard, and they both say ""man"" a lot. But that's where the similarity ends. Flynn is philosophical. The Dude isn't - people just read philosophy into what he says, even when there is none. Flynn is an achiever. The Dude is a loser. Flynn cares about the future. The Dude just wants his rug back... So I don't think it's fair at all to say that Flynn is now the Dude. It doesn't make any sense to say that. Sure, the movie has plenty of things to criticize. But calling Flynn ""the Dude"" just because they look alike is a cheap shot that doesn't require any actual thinking.For me, the biggest problem with the movie was that the story wasn't so great. Mostly because it featured far too much exposition. And in a lot of cases, there were setups for some great fights - which were never shown. For example, toward the end, Sam goes into a room to fight. He says his one liner, and then the whole fight occurs off-screen. This is very ineffective and a bit of a let down. Maybe it was done this way on purpose to avoid a PG-13 rating, but I was disappointed.And all of the stuff with the ISO's... That's not a bad story, but all they did was tell us about it in flashbacks. That's not very effective storytelling. If they had made THAT the story rather than what we got, it might have been more interesting.Plus, I never bought into the whole ""The ISO's will change everything"" argument anyway. ""Religion, science, medicine..."" I'm sorry, but I don't get that. It seems an awful lot like hand-waving on a lazy writers' part, trying to make us think the ISO's are more significant than they are. I mean, the programs in this movie can already think and act independently which is not at all approximating reality to begin with. So how is finding another batch of programs that can do the same in any way significant? So they were randomly generated. So what? What does that have to do with ""religion, science, and medicine""? Or ""everything""?I've seen other reviewers here defend this plot point religiously. I think you guys are making something out of nothing. You WANT the story to make sense. You WANT the story to be great. But it isn't. Yet you still try to argue to convince people like me that it is.What we got wasn't all bad, however. I still really enjoyed the movie, and I would like to see another sequel. It had some neat effects. I liked the derezzing effect especially. Story-wise, the father / son angle was good.It also had some bad effects. Namely, the young CGI Jeff Bridges. Now I didn't mind this when used for Clu. Clu is a program, after all. So dead eyes and a creepy, frozen face are acceptable for him. But it's not acceptable for the younger Kevin Flynn. It's only one moment, but it seems apparent that the CGI technology is not quite there yet.The story was not very complicated. This was good and bad. Good in that it was simple and easy to understand. Bad in that there wasn't a lot of motivation besides ""Clu is doing this because he is evil"". But that's exactly the way the first movie was, so I can't complain.Tron is underused in the movie, which is a pity. But I didn't mind this too much. Even in the first movie, Tron himself is a pretty flat character. Just a crusading do-gooder. Still, I wish they had done more with him here, instead of turning him into a generic Darth Vader-type. But it was still good.Ram also shows up, by the way. Or at least, his programmer does (""Alan, can I have some of your popcorn?""). But this isn't in the movie itself - it's only on the special features. There's a whole section of deleted scenes with an entire subplot featuring the guy, called ""Flynn Lives"". I am sorry to see that none of that made it into the movie, but I can see why it was cut.It is also worth mentioning that same as the original movie, Tron Legacy really shines when it comes to the music. Instead of Wendy Carlos, we get Daft Punk. I credit this movie for turning me on to Daft Punk, a most excellent electronica duo. The music they do is great, both for this movie and in their own albums.Also, as a special feature, this movie includes Daft Punk's most excellent ""Derezzed"" video. This features two sci-fi jousting figures on a Tron-esque landscape. It has to be one of the coolest videos of all time! Certainly the coolest I've ever seen.As for the 3D... I am a 3D enthusiast, and own many 3D movies. I liked the 3D in this movie. It was nothing spectacular, all depth effects really. But it was very well done and I enjoyed watching it. I think the 3D adds to the experience here, and I can't say that about all 3D movies.This particular pack also comes with the original Tron, which I don't care to review other than to say I love it. It's not perfect either, but it's still great. And having it on Blu-Ray is NICE.The final verdict: Tron Legacy is a good movie. Not great, but good. It had a lot of potential, and - to be fair - a lot of hype to live up to. Perhaps there is no way it could have measured up to such expectations. It is hard for me to judge the movie without thinking I might be biased, or overly critical. I wanted the movie to be a lot better than it was. It let me down, but I'm still pretty happy with what we got. I'm still giving it 5 stars because I like it so much. I hope they make another.",Tron: The Original Classic / Tron: Legacy
932400,"""Felicity: An American Girl Adventure"" is wonderful filmmaking, sure to capture the attention of anyone who appreciates historical drama with a human touch. This one is set in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the American Revolution, and the title character displays a tenacious heroism in her quest to do what is right, despite the threat of imminent danger. Felicity Merriman is beautifully played by Shailene Woodley. She is just perfect for the role, with an energetic screen presence, illuminated by a sweet smile that will steal your heart. Felicity's love for an abused horse teaches her, indirectly, how kindness to others can have a ""ripple effect"" for goodness and justice, no matter that the colonial world has erupted into rebellion. The direction is fluent but not overdone, cinematography is attractive, and acting is uniformly strong throughout the cast. In the interest of full disclosure, I should add that some of the period dialogue does not exactly roll off the lips in convincing fashion, and the special effect of snowfall looks awfully phony, but otherwise I bought this delightful production with no problem at all. You will be happy with this splendid film, which is funny, VERY touching at times, and ultimately inspirational.",Felicity - An American Girl Adventure

Evil Ed completely a waste and irritation. If I had a friend like him I would... I wouldn't have a friend like him. Complete idiot of a character. The movie and story would have done a lot better w/o him.  The film was shot well and had good sets and atmosphere for a vampire film.

1653541,"Actor William Shatner came up with an inspired idea in the documentary feature ""The Captains."" Adding a missing piece to the legacy of television's longest running space saga, the film united the six actors that have been featured as Captains in the show's various interpretations. Chris Pine from the current movies appeared in the full length film, but is not a notable part of the documentary series ""The Captains Close Up."" This five part series that appeared on the EPIX network (yeah, I don't know what that is either) is basically an expansion of the film. Each of the five episodes deals specifically with one of the TV captains. The interviews deal, obviously, with the Star Trek experience but also with their travails as actors in general. And Shatner steps forward both as subject and interviewer using footage he captured for the movie version.The five included episodes are each approximately 30 minutes in length for a total program content of about 2 1/2 hours. In addition, there is some Bonus interview footage with Shatner that is exclusive to the DVD release.The Five episodes are:1) William Shatner: Star Trek2) Patrick Stewart: The Next Generation3) Avery Brooks: Deep Space Nine4) Kate Mulgrew: Voyager5) Scott Bakula: EnterpriseAt the heart of the series is Shatner himself. He is, at once, the show's most valuable asset and one of its primary weaknesses. As a persona, he is as lively as ever. As an interviewer, however, he lacks a bit of focus constantly bringing any conversation back to what seems to be his favorite topic--himself. It is sometimes awkward, sometimes endearing. At the beginning of each interview, he seems to want to introduce some deep philosophical concept to make the casual get-togethers seem as if they are fraught with meaning. One of my favorite moments is when he is absolutely incredulous when Stewart says he was in an adult theater piece at the age of 12 (with bulging enthusiasm, ""How did you get into a play with adults?"" as if it were a strange concept for a budding thespian). Other odd moments include him singing along to Brooks' piano playing and the strangely sexist bend his interview with Mulgrew hits.Through it all, though, Shatner is an enthusiastic guide. The interviews may lack some insight, as I've mentioned, but they are entertaining enough. ""The Captains Close Up"" is certainly an easy recommendation for Star Trek enthusiasts, perhaps less so for others. If you've seen the film version of ""The Captains,"" you'll know exactly what to expect. If not, I might suggest that you sample that first. I'm not sure, having seen both the movie and now the series, that I felt both were essential. But again, if you're a fan, I suppose there are worse ways to spend your time.

1469992,"Long story short: Tom (Jason Segel; Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Jeff Who Lives At Home) and Violet (gorgeous Emily Blunt; The Devil Wears Prada, The Wolfman) are an engaged couple who's upcoming wedding day keeps getting delayed for various reasons.  Through deaths, careers, and education, family and friends begin to wonder whether or not Tom and Violet are ever going to walk down the aisle.  And, you know what, so did I.While the performances are great and the overall story is interesting enough, the biggest problems here are pacing and structure.  The movie is all over the place.  The story feels very episodic as, in one scene while taking care of her niece, Violet is shot in the leg with an arrow.  Obviously, Alex (Chris Pratt; Wanted, ""Parks and Recreation""), Tom's best friend and father to Violet's niece, is pissed that Tom's negligence led to the accidental shooting.  Then suddenly we flash cut to Alex toasting Tom for being a great guy.  This type of editing makes you forget that you're watching a movie and not a soap opera which also helps to contribute to the overlong run time.  Through out the duration of the movie, I kept wanting to either look at the clock or found myself thinking about something else entirely.  Jokes are repeated.  ""Don't worry, they'll live.""  Jump to a funeral.  ""At least no one died"".  Once again, another funeral and still no wedding.  Tom grows a really fake looking, Yosammitti Sam beard anc mustache.  On the sleeve is reprinted Owen Gleiberman's glowing blurb, ""Lively, Original, and Hilarious.""  Did we see the same movie?  More like ""Dead, Cliched, With Moments of Comedy.""

571681,"The story behind the filming of Gore Vidal's novel is by now legendary; the finished film has been savaged by critics since its release in 1970. In truth Michael Sarne's version isn't as bad as all that: the film offers a suggestive view of how gender constructions are constructed in different societies, and how prejudice often inhibits individuals from expressing themselves.  Hence Myra's (Raquel Welch's) desire to take revenge on those members of the patriarchy who oppress her. Sarne's film uses images of the Golden Age of Hollywood to contrast the grimy reality of present-day (i.e. late 60s) America with the dream-factory world portrayed onscreen.  There are some truly bizarre elements: with her fake blonde wig and reedy voice, Mae West resembles a hellish version of Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950). Rex Reed's acting is perfunctory, while John Huston delivers his lines with tongue firmly planted in cheek. Nonetheless the film is still worth attention,",N/A

1534793,"THE DEAD WANT WOMENI am a huge Full Moon fan and own most of the films if not all of them in some form. So every year when October rolls around and I get even more into watching all my horror films. True I watch them all year long but Halloween time makes them just a little more special. I wish I could say that this film is just as special but sadly it is not. This for a Full Moon film is average at best, I love these types of flicks but it just fell flat most of the time.The story is about a silent movie star who is having one of the best nights of her life. Her career is going great and all her friends are at her house for a party. All of that is great until she is informed that her contract with the studio is being cancelled. The new age of talking pictures has stopped her career cold. In receiving this information she kills her entourage as well as herself condemning them to a life stuck in that house. Fast forward to the here and now and two female relaters are excited to be selling the old house. After meeting there to finalize the deal with the new buyer the women are attacked by the long thought gone inhabitants of the house. What's worse is they may be a part of something bigger.It is easy to see what director Charles Band was going for here, that old school Hollywood look and feel. As for the overall feeling of the film I think he accomplished that. Still this film just falls flat even with band accomplishing what he wanted to. The story is cool enough story but it wasn't executed correctly I guess. As for the acting it is exactly what it should have been for this type of flick but even that feels out of place in a film where it should have been right at home. Everything about this flick is cheesy B movie badness, oh how I wish it was cheesy B movie goodness. Even with Eric Roberts it is a bit of a let down.The zombie makeup is good for this kind of flick but they look more ghoul/demon like then zombie like. Still I take that as a good thing as I do with the other thing this movie did right, the ladies. Well not just the ladies but the ladies and the lack of their clothes. For a good portion of this movie it is almost a porno at one point as the silent starlet and her crew are into some very freaky things. So over this entire movie isn't all bad, I would have loved a Videozone for this. That would have been excellent, or maybe a commentary from Band himself.",N/A

737286,"""13 Rue Madeleine,"" (1947).  This American postwar black and white World War II spy thriller was deliberately held back until the end of the war, to avoid giving the Axis powers any clue as to how our new spy service, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), worked.  It's a classic action/adventure/drama, directed by Henry Hathaway, filmed on location in Quebec, standing in for occupied France, in a semi-documentary style that was new then, and had audiences flocking to the theaters. Viewers may notice that, to be extra careful, the OSS is never mentioned by name in this film.  Louis de Rochmont produced; he and Hathaway had also made the New York based World War II spy thrillerThe House on 92nd Street (Fox Film Noir), pioneering the semi-documentary style. 13 RUE MADELEINE now survives in an uneasy half-life, probably because of its star, James Cagney. The pint-sized former song and dance man -- and ultimate player of gangsters -- plays Robert Emmett ""Bob"" Sharkey, former spy himself, kicked upstairs to teach the first classes of fledgling spies at O.S.S.Sharkey finds that one of his agents in training is a Nazi double, but decides not to arrest him.  Instead, Sharkey decides to feed the double agent false information about the Allied invasion of Europe.  Meanwhile, a team of agents goes to France to find a secret V-2 rocket depot.  But the German spy has not been fooled, murders another of Sharkey's men, and manages to rejoin his people.  He now knows too much and Sharkey has made a decision that came back to haunt him.  Knowing he faces tremendous risks, Sharkey goes into France himself to try to clean up his mess.Cagney, (Yankee Doodle Dandy,The Public Enemy) receives able support from the beauteous French actress Annabella, who was married to heartthrob Tyrone Power at the time.  However, she's wasted in her part as Suzanne de Beaumont, telegraph operator.  Also providing able backing are Richard Conte (Perchance to Dream) as Bill O'Connell; Frank Latimore as Jeff Lassiter; Walter Abel(The Green Light) as Sharkey's boss Charles Gibson, and Sam Jaffe (Ben Hur) as Mayor Galimard of the French village in the eye of the storm.  The young actors Red Buttons and Karl Malden have unaccredited parts as jump masters.  The young E.G. Marshall plays Emile.  The notorious Russian spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg appear as themselves in archival footage.The movie is dated, sometimes unrealistic, perhaps excessively patriotic and nave for modern tastes but Cagney and Conte have meaty roles and do well by them.  Oh, and the title?  13 Rue Madeleine is the address of the Gestapo in Le Havre, nearest big city to where the action in France is taking place.  It becomes important in the film, though not necessarily to the viewer.  However, the film still has some entertainment value thanks to its players.",13 Rue Madeleine

But Tomatsk is never the main player in any of these scenes, save the final one; he's on the sidelines, and we're led to believe he's a bit player, a piece of window dressing or local color, until we realize that, in fact, this entire sequence of events has led up to Tomatsk being in this alley at this particular time, and we hear one thing just as the camera pans round and we see another, and god if it isn't tempting indeed to believe the lord loves drunks and fools, but god is nowhere to be found in this tale of warring magics and forbidden love.Plot: Mary (Prometheus' Kate Dickey) and her son Fergal (Niall Bruton in his first feature appearance) are wanderers, and they've just settled into a new flat in the heart of Dublin's tenement district. Mary is a witch, and her first act after the bags are unpacked is to paint the walls with protective runes against any who would harm her or Fergal. Living next door is a Scots/Romany family, but most we see of them, save a single scene (the first scene in the sequence I described in the first paragraph, in fact) is fetching Petronella (Hanna Stanbridge, also in her feature debut) and her brother Tomatsk. Fergal and Petronella meet by chance one day outside the local grocery, and nothing is quite the same after that. But love brings vulnerability, and Mary and Fergal's settling has not gone unnoticed: a pair of magicians, Liam and is apprentice Cathal (Red Tails's Ciaran McMenamin and Millions' James Nesbitt) are tracking them, though the local Laird (Braveheart's James Cosmo) is wary of their presence, and an inhuman beast seems also to be stalking the family, striking closer to home with each kill.""Urban fantasy"" has been one of the great buzzwords in publishing for about a decade now, stories of faerie transplanted to New York or LA or Vegas or London, but this is the first time I've ever seen a movie that I can say with no qualms is a serious attempt as making a film that qualifies as urban fantasy.  And despite McCarthy's falling to convention in the last fifteen minutes or so and filling the ending full of twists (though all of them are as carefully set up as the scene above), there's no doubt this film fills the bill. McCarthy has taken a tale of wizards and witches and set it in Dublin, plastered it over with that dark, oppressive urban-fantasy atmosphere, even thrown in the requisite romance subplot, and the entire damn thing succeeds. It succeeds, I think, because (I'm hypothesizing here, but this is how it feels to me) McCarthy, since he was working in a field very popular in literature but almost nonexistent in film, approached this as a novel. He thought a lot about setting up that sequence I talked about in the opening paragraph, and that's not an anomaly; that's the way this movie goes. The movie is slow during the first half, but that's what comes from taking your time to develop your characters; I don't think most film viewers will have a problem with that if they don't go in expecting a big action film. It helps, of course, that the McCarthys have written characters that they actually do develop. If the movie does have a flaw, it's that the main characters are so realistic that the two-dimensional minor characters (the women from the Tenement Association, Petronella's ex-boyfriend, and the Laird are all good examples) stand out maybe more than they should. But I wasn't willing to let that interfere with my enjoyment of what is otherwise an excellent piece of work. This is truly must-see TV for fans of urban fantasy. ****",Outcast

You worry about the characters, you don't want them to get infected. You're rooting for them to survive. It's exactly what I would want from a zombie movie, sadly it's PG-13 so it's limited on what it can show. That's good and bad, most zombie movies over do it with gore which I hate. I liked the subtle violence. It's a lot of exploding and running, impossible getaways, and silly plot.

1525718,"Two Years ago, if you had told me Disney (not Pixar) was making a movie with video games as characters, I would simply laugh and say ""the people at Disney have gone nuts"". Here recently however, I have found that sometimes its the movies we write off or ignore, are the main movies that should not be missed. That said, Wreck It Ralph should not be missed. It is one of Disney's best movies. I honestly do not understand how Brave won the title as Best Animated Feature at this years Academy Awards when Wreck It Ralph is clearly the better movie, but oh well.Wreck It Ralph stars John C Reily as the title character Ralph. Enter Ralph: 9 feet tall 640 something pound character in an arcade game who is a bad guy that desperately wants to be a good guy. For what its worth, his character is very likeable. Then we have Jack Mcbrayer as Fix it Felix, Jane Lynch as Sergeant Calhoun, and Sarah Silverman as the loveable Vanellope von Schweetz. Vanellope's character is also very interesting. She is a young girl who is initially an outcast because she is a ""glitch"" in the game she is in but as the movie progresses, you ultimately come to realize there is clearly more to her character than meets the eye.The story line is what this movie delivers best. It not only brings laughs, notable touching moments, and video game cameos from past and present, but it also deals with issues (like bullying) that need to be addressed and it does it very well. It also goes to show that sometimes it IS the little things that count.I have to say again, I did not expect to like this movie. But after multiple viewings, it is one I love and had to own in my collection. People young and old will enjoy Wreck It Ralph.5 Stars",Wreck It Ralph

731904,"Quick rundown on the narrative, as not to sound too repetitive: Rich woman, wife of a diplomat and clothing designer, seeks rare bird feathers and native art. She meets an Aussie man who, along with another man, two women, and a young boy, are seeking a valley (the title) where they will find utopia (I guess). As they move closer to this valley, she begins to sever ties with her social/bourgeoise life, and sheds any material needs. The group is found to be ""hippies"" by her, and she succumbs to their seemingly inane search for ""the valley.""As I watched this movie, I was reminded of Werner Herzog's ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" (did I say that?!?!). However, Herzog's movie is cinematic genius; Schroeder lacks the same great narrative ability. The shots and ethnographic footage is similar (meeting natives in foggy landscapes), but Herzog ""became"" the film (if you have seen Les Blank's documentary ""Burden of Dreams,"" then you understand what I am describing). This movie relies too much on toeing a line between being an ethnographic movie and a narrative of the time it was made. I believe it fails in both ways, but not as badly as to render the film absolutely awful. I liked it to a point, taking it in as a ""period piece"" (in the vein of a movie like ""Glen and Randa"" or ""Zabriskie Point"") than for face-value. After all, it is about shedding one's pretentious ways for a greater aim. However, it is a bit long and over-winded.The music by Pink Floyd seemed more for a gimmick (to sell the movie) than to give a greater level to the narrative. The film is made like a documentary, but most of what happens is not shocking or really all that imaginative. The constant use of Australians using French seems really crazed! Is every ""white"" person in New Guinea Australian who speak fluent French? The movie also ""feels"" like it should have been made some 5 years BEFORE release. By 1972, I tend to believe that this movie would already have seemed dated.The DVD, by HVE, has some problems. The greatest I found is that there are a couple of scenes in the transfer where one can see the film ""skip."" The filmstrip is noticeable, with sprocket holes and all! Wow. I don't know why.The ""greens"" of New Guinea, along with the misty mountains (reminiscent of Herzog's ""Aguirre"") are beautiful (obviously, with Nestor Almendros' cinematography). I enjoyed the ethnographic imagery and of rites and dances of the natives. For someone interested in them, this film is worth a look.3 of 5 Amazon stars. I take 1/2 off for the DVD transfer. It is, nevertheless, an interesting view, but many will probably be bored by some overlong scenes. The movie could truly have been better with 30 or so minutes trimmed.",N/A

The embryos stored from the first growth experiment were frozen for another time, and one was brought back to make Eve, a new and improved alien / human hybrid.  In the meantime, an astronaut crew went for the first manned mission to Mars and returned infected with the same alien virus (or whatever it is) that brought us Sil from the first movie.  The GQ model captain has returned to earth, infected and sewing his wild oats with all the hot girls he can get his hands on, producing some silent, equally as creepy little children who keep looming in the distance in silence (think Village of the Damned).

The stars were Stefania Bonfadelli and Scott Piper, who happened to be Radames in Busseto's Aida.  It was an outstanding performance in every way, musically and technically.  Zeffirelli provided not only beautiful staging, but more importantly the mentoring of the young singers.  For comparison, Bonfadelli was Lucia the following year (2003) in a DVD put out by Teatro Carlo Felice, Genova.  While she was still enticing, the DVD was overall inferior, especially technically.

1561987,"To start, watch out for the first period of the film, set on Krypton. It's full of sci-fi and comic eye-candy.It was great that Christopher Nolan chose a darker hero for his superhero debut. Given that he'd been directing such-themed movies (Memento, The Following, Inception), wouldn't it follow that the Man of Steel himself would take on a darker tone? While in a few ways it did, Zack Snyder's fantastic vision (as per usual) and Zimmer's cold, bright score helped breathe a different life into DC Comics' newest film feature.While I'm familiar with only some films (and none of the comics) with Superman, I will say I enjoyed this one most. It is a wonderful, emotionally-involved origin story that leads you through the development of this Man of Steel quite well. Henry Cavill plays an extraordinary man learning what it means to be a hero. I appreciated seeing his normal human attitude shine through. After all, he grew up knowing no other way to act.Amy Adams as Lois Lane didn't fit as I hoped, though she did fair. The Daily Planet group did well, but were slightly off-putting. I'm hoping they do more in future films, if they appear. Michael Shannon's was my favorite performance: a near-emotionless (yet obsessed) general with a greater good in mind, and nothing will stay in his way. The climax of the story was just as it should have been.Here are a few ways Nolan's darker presence have seeped in. Krypton is seen as a plague, destroying to survive, but I won't go further into that. The threats in Man of Steel are very real, and have dire effects. This isn't Avengers. People die, destruction reigns. That said, the violence isn't blatant, but does happen. On that note, there is some language and frightening/intense scenes, but nothing more to worry about. I highly appreciate the lack of inappropriate material in this film.In conclusion, Man of Steel has not let much in the past explicitly define it. A unique costume, altered chronology, real terror and threats, character accuracy and development, and more are all defined by this film more than the previous ones (or other superhero films). I recommend it to all fans and newcomers.",N/A

1456317,"This series is stellar in its delivery, richly shot, and Krister Henriksson is fantastic in the lead role.  Comments here about the series being available on NetFlix or Itunes are valid; you can see this cheaper.  But however you see it, see it.  It is not often i see i drama so well crafted that i am thinking about an episode 2 or 3 days later.  With respect to the first season, i think Season 2 is better in terms of pacing and storyline (i suspect that is because Season 2 is not beholden to written novels).  i cannot compare it to the Branaugh version, because i haven't seen that yet, but i seriously doubt Braunaugh could match Krister Henriksson in this role.  i only wish Henriksson would make more.Update:  August 6, 2013I have now watched all of the Branagh Wallanders on Netflix.  They are certainly worth watching, and it is nice that there is no real overlap between the Branagh and Henriksson series (in the sense that the Branagh series is based on earlier Mankell stories, and is in this sense, a prequel).  But i still think Henriksson's portrayal of Wallander is better, and urge anyone who enjoys the Branagh version to give Henriksson a try.Henriksson is steely-eyed and stony-faced; understated; and as genuine as the Gracean formula in his hair and the Every-Who-in-Whoville-ness of his beer gut.  Branagh, in contrast, looks like he just left the set of the View (where he was part of an intervention) and took Hollywood lessons on how to brandish a gun.  Henriksson wears a cheap suit and tie (in which he appears demonstrably uncomfortable); Branagh wears a laid back army jacket, and the fashion-appropriate amount of razor stubble.  It is obvious, when watching Henriksson's Wallander, why his daughter is mad at him (because he is, after all, a callous prick, who has always put his job before his family); but it never seems justifed when her counterpart is upset with Branagh's Wallander.  Branagh is, in short, too warm and fuzzy. Henriksson is spot on.all that said, it could be that things just seem smarter when you are reading subtitles.",Henning Mankell's Wallander

You have to know that the movie itself is a bit deeper than I would have first anticipated, but this deeper nature within the film is offset by the amazing acting of both Christopher Walken and Philip Seymour Hoffman. You're drawn into the cell and into the life of Christopher Walken's character and the medical issues that he is dealing with that is leading to his retirement. Yet, the movie so much more than just the drama of the health issues surrounding Walken's character. The movie itself explores so much about human relationships and group dynamics and a it is through these relationships that you truly get to understand the importance of the Quartet itself within the film. overall this is a movie that I would encourage all to watch as it is full of amazing acting performances as well as a plot and underlying message that should be shared with all.*I received a copy of this Blu-Ray in return for an honest review, but this did not impact the words that I shared with all of you above*",A Late Quartet

1480657,"Total Recall(released Aug/12)stars Colin Farrell as Douglas ""Doug"" Quaid/Carl Hauser,Kate Beckinsale as Lori, Jessica Biel as Melina,Bryan Cranston as Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen,Bokeem Woodbine as Harry,Bill Nighy as Matthias Lair,John Cho as Bob McC and others.As a ""reviewer"",one will come upon films,specifically remakes(alarmingly on the increase in today's Hollywood),and have different expectations than an ""original"" film.One of the basic tenets of a reviewer is to be objective,but being the human beings that we are,that isn't always 100% possible,ALL of the time.Prejudices do creep in whether personal or otherwise.I have to admit beforehand that I really liked the original,so when I watched this film for the first time today I was telling the film mentally""Show me what you can do...convince me"".So with that bit off my chest,let's see what the story is all about.It is in an Earth future,with a Blade Runner-ish look,where wars at the end of the 21st century have almost completely devastated the entire planet.There are two countries left,the UFB(United federation of Britain) and the Colony(Australia).The UFB imports alot of its workforce from the Colony and they come and go daily by the ""Fall"".This huge cylindrical device carries thousands of passengers from one country to the other,through the middle of the Earth.Farrell lives with Beckinsale,and is stuck in a dead end job.He keeps having recurring dreams about being captured by police forces while a female accomplice escapes.One day he heads over to Rekall,a place where they can implant new memories of anything a client desires.Farrell picks being a secret agent.Just before they start the process they realize Farrell has already a secret agent implant and they stop it.Just then the police burst in and Farrell,acting on unknown instincts,takes the entire six man team out.Farrell escapes and returns home only to have Beckinsale turn against him and pursue him through the city,trying to kill him.It seems she was a police plant,pretending to be his wife and that he was at one time working for chancellor Cohagen.The trick Farrell now has is to survive and find out exactly who he is and what they wanted of him.There are many trails for him to go through,but he eventually meets up with the woman from his dreams who is actually working for the resistance(Biel).Along the way Farrell finds equipment of his and his old apartment where the pieces start to come together.Farrell it seems was working for the chancellor initially but changed sides when he became aware of the chancellor's agenda to raze the Colony and build a new one.He was recaptured and re-programed by the chancellor but now that he has regained his memory he must try and stop the chancellor's plans from coming to fruition,with Biels help.He meets up with the resistance leader,but soon after the police arrive and take down the leader.Farrell and Biel are recaptured,with the chancellor ordering that Farrell's mind be wiped to its original self.Before they can do that Farrell escapes.The chancellor now puts into motion his plans of a Colony conquest and sends thousands of troops onto the Fall.Farrell follows the chancellor and Biel onto it.During the transport's journey Farrell plants explosives and manages to rescue Biel.At the other end the clamps holding the machine in place explode one by one,until it free falls and breaks apart in a huge explosion.After it all Farrell is in an ambulance and he wakes up to find Biel there,but it is really Beckinsale in disguise.He dispatches her and the real Biel and he are reunited.This new version of the film doesn't leave Earth,as did the first one to Mars.The strife is all here instead of on another planet.There are a few nods to the original as when Farrell says he had always wanted to go to Mars.There is also a check out through security onto the Fall,which mimics the security check when arriving on Mars in the original.It also has a woman checking ahead of a disguised Farrell.For those who recall the original,we are tricked into thinking that Farrell is really the woman,but it is a red herring.Overall I found I just could not get too involved with Farrell and company.There just wasn't enough oomph there,not enough spark to really pull me in.The acting that was tepid and couldn't ""believe"" enough for it to work for me.I also was wondering,plot wise,why did the Colony not blow up the Fall's entry point at their end in order to kybosh the chancellors invasion plans? Bottom line,sad to say,it couldn't ""convince"" me.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include about three featurettes,commentary and a gag reel.All in all a disappointing remake of the original starring Colin Farrell.Farrell just does not have the acting chops to compete with Ahh-nold from the original,nor make us forget the original and focus on HIS efforts.Biel and others he spends most of his on screen time with,are also tepid.Beckinsale is the exception and Nighy does a good but short turn as the resistance leader,but it is all for naught.",N/A

I was worried that I was interpreting a movie about the Holocaust incorrectly, but no, that was the intention of the film. Weird, right? Some people have found that disrespectful, but I thought the film was very well done. I must admit that I selected it randomly off the foreign language shelf in the library, wanting something new, and didn't even look at it that closely. I was therefore surprised at the abrupt change of pace in the middle of the movie. I enjoyed it a lot, though. I don't care that the beginning was silly. Why not have fun in life? The silliness in the second half was hard to get a grasp on, even knowing the father was doing it for the sake of his son. I think... if I was one of the men staying in the same shack as the two of them, I would have gotten fed up with that ""game"" pretty quickly. Well, probably immediately. Him shielding his son from the Nazis didn't strike me as unbelievable so much as a bunch of random prisoners not getting in the way of one man's game.

743356,"Out of all the Buffy the Vampire Slayer seasons, season 4 tends to be the most infamous of the bunch. With that in mind, one may be a little worried to start this DVD set. My advice? Just watch and enjoy it. While this season is a bit cluddered with errors, it is better than average television and I would highly reccomend it to any fan of the show.Season 4 begins with Buffy, Willow, and Oz starting their college careers and Xander, not in college and living in his mom's basement, and Giles, now retired, wondering where their lives are going. We now see more of Anya, Xander's new girlfriend who once a demon, and Spike becomes a main character after being neutered of his bad vampire powers. While we do not get to learn much about Anya, despite that she enertaining and a little psychotic, Spike is a wonderful addition to the main cast. When he is on screen with his blunt and funny dialogue and aggravating behavior you cannot help but love him. Two new love interests are brought into the show, Riley and the beautiful Tara. Riley is Buffy's new boyfriend who just happens to have a double life of his own. While he came off as ok in the earlier episodes, he is a very boring and uninteresting character. I do not think I can say one thing mentionable or unique about his personality. Tara becomes Willow's new lesbian love partner. She also studies witchcraft and is timid, making Willow the leader of their relationship. While I do not dislike Tara's character, I feel like she is just an expansion of the ever growing Willow and I have hopes her personality will expand in the next seasons. What about Oz, Willow's boyfriend, you ask? He has to leave town because of his werewolf troubles. This is disappointing because he was one of the show's coolest and most loved, by me at least, characters.Plot wise? While I enjoy the new college setting and found it refreshing compared to the high school, this season was extremely lacking on the supernatural side of things. The main plot involves The Initiative, which seriously ends of being one of the government organizations things ever. They do experiments on supernatural creatures and have a secret plan of combining demons and people to create super-soldiers. It is up to Buffy and the gang to get rid of this underground organization together! While being a different and potentially interesting idea, it really falls flat and failed to engage me and take it seriously. The main super-soldier villain in the organization, Adam, was laughable. My mom watched a few episodes with me and she could not stop laughing at his voice and speeches.My final complaint with this season is that the episodes start to reach the low that Season 1 was. The show had overcome this such a long time ago but here they are again. Episodes like Where the Wild Things Are and Beer Bad are just dreadful and as bad as you heard before watching them. A few other episodes clunk around and failed to keep my attention. Thankfully, there were a handful of classics and highlights along the way! Fear, Itself, Something Blue, Hush, Who Are You?, and Restless are all Buffy at the top of it's game. These are some of the most creative and entertaining episodes yet. Not to mention, this is a really funny season as well. You are bound to chuckle a few times during the episodes.In conclusion, while Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 4 made some glaring mistakes, it was an overall enertaining season with some classic episodes. I am extremely started to start watching Season 5, what is known to be a fan favorite.",N/A

She gets caught up in the underground world (again literally) of smuggling. At some point she comes to sympathize with the illegals, but the film really didn't drive that home until she gives a speech to a policeman.As far as a crime/drama/thriller I didn't feel too thrilled, perhaps because they wanted to take a realistic approach as the film was inspired by true events.

409467,"Made in 1943, this film from the collaboration between director Vittorio de Sica, Italian actor movie star of the '30s and the screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, is undoubtedly the first masterpiece signed De Sica (still require revision the few films he made before and Madeleine Zero in Conduct is not far from the claim). In all cases, it is a key work between cinema of the 30s, inherited from fascism and neo-realism that would follow. It can therefore be placed on the same plane as OBSESSIONE Visconti. Like the latter, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING mark a break with the cinema of the 30s, referring to some previously taboo themes (adultery, unhappy childhood, critical view of society and the petty bourgeoisie, generally pampered by the regime).

1110402,"A great film for the action-adventure crowd, especially because it is true and very close to the actual events of Dieter Dengler's shoot-down and captivity. It also is very well shot in the jungles of Thailand, jungles very similar to Laos and northern South Vietnam.As Christian Bale says, the actors didn't try to imitate the real life characters, they just based their performances on the characters without trying to copy their speech inflections and mannerisms. This is a truly great film from the point of view of someone who has been there and knows the terrain of the triple canopy jungle in that deadly area of NW South Vietnam and SE Laos. That it has a happy ending is simply an accident of events and the good fortune of one person.Dieter Dengler should have been a national hero, with his name on the lips of everyone in the USA. That would have happened if he hadn't been flying in the wrong war at at the wrong time. LBJ and the CIA were conducting a totally illegal black war in Laos and the men who were shot down mostly paid the ultimate price for having been there. Dieter Dengler had an irrepressible optimism, unrelenting determination and the good fortune of happy coincidence on his side or he, too, would have been one of those permanent MIA's.",N/A

1316705,"Seeding of clouds with dry ice or silver iodide has been used for many years to produce rainfall artificially. This sci-fi film is about an experiment to use 2000 drones to create the clouds themselves, seed them with silver iodide and then have the drones recharge themselves automatically by drawing in atmospheric carbon dioxide and freezing it to dry ice. The drones drift in the upper atmosphere to a new location and then start the process all over again. Unfortunately, they are a little too successful and start producing mini ice tornados in one location after another in north-western USA. Frank (Robert Moloney) is the coordinating bureaucrat behind the project and the guy who puts up the money. Once the experiment is underway they find its effects are dramatic and fatal but the scientists in the field are powerless to moderate it. Meanwhile former scientist turned sci-fi author Charlie Price (whose has just had a signing locally for his latest novel) gets drawn in to the impending disaster. It's not a great movie but the special effects are quite good and it's an entertaining enough film using a piece of nearly believable science when actual highly damaging hailstorms with tennis-ball sized hailstones have become a reality of our present-day weather.",N/A

However, I really didn't even miind her at all; she slides into her part just fine.

1623201,"This disc is really odd. I am halfway through it. And man, does it have issues.First, it is a documentary about ranching on the Hungarian Plains. If it wasn't for the horseback riders wearing Hungarian Costumes, I would have sworn this was filmed in the Texas Panhandle or Oklahoma - almost the exact same landscape, similar flora and fonna, even similar architecture. Horses are horses, goats are goats, and longhorn cows are longhorn cows no matter where they are. There are even some shots that look amazingly like a field of Bluebonnets and firewheels, although the film does tell what the flowers are.There is not a lot of varrience in landscape, either. It looks like the guy who shot the video had a friend who owned some land in Hungry, and asked if he could shoot out there. It seems like an awfully small sampling of an area to title it ""Europe's Most Beautiful Places"". And while I am sure it is pretty low landfall, there is obviously more rainfall there than any other ""desert"" I have ever seenThe narration is attrocious (sp?). It felt like I was back in school watching a horrible 1950s educational film. She will put you to sleep. Luckily a Music only track is provided.The disc specifications say English / German Audio tracks, but all I saw was English and a music only track.The video.... Okay, so let's start out by saying that the 3D effect is AMAZING! Stuff really pops out of the screen. One of the best looking uses of 3D I have ever seen.Tis the FIRST 3D release that I have ever seen that...... HAS GHOSTING BAKED INTO THE VIDEO!!! However, it's not the only visual issue.Pretty much, it looks like the entire show was filmed with a Pro-sumer grade 3D HD camera, and an older model at that. It seems that there are quite a few interpolated frames. While this looks fine on static landscapes, the video starts to blur a bit on pans. However, when horses are running across the picture, or sheep, goats or cows are in motion, not only does the picture blur and soften, but there are some very obvious ghosting effects. Pausing on a frame of, say, a horse running, will show what looks to be 2 or three frames composited on top of each other, with your current frame being the sharpest, and what looks like the before frame and the after frame which are semi-transparent. As you can see the horses legs in three very different points of motion, and not what you would expect - a left and right image speration issue, this leads me to believe that the issue stems from a camera that is not shooting a full 24 /25 / 30 frames a second and is in fact interpolating footage. As most of the shots are fairly static, though, this issue only rears its ugly head every now and then.There was something else that was really bugging me - just how soft the picture was during camera pans and action scenes. Turns out that the film has a bitrate between 9-13Mbps (the 13 gets hit in high motion scenes)... for a 3D TITLE! Who the heck encodes a movie that tight? The movie is only 53 minutes long, and there are no extras or subtitles, so why such a tight bitrate? The entire disc is just 11.5 gig.If this was released by a major studio, I would be screaming for a replacement disc.That being said, it's NOT awful. Like I said, the 3D IS INCREDIBLE, and there are some beautiful shots in here. And the disc is fairly priced at $10.",World's Nature 3D: Europe's Most Beautiful Places

On the other end of the spectrum is Weevil, Wallace, and the other disenfranchised students at Neptune HS. And smack dab in the middle is Veronica (and her dad), keeping this whole universe spinning on its axis. Keith Mars used to be the town sheriff, till he got booted.

1677176,"There have been a number of films and mini-series over the years that deal with the lives of African-American slaves and the history of slavery in America. But what I think 12 Years A Slave brings to the table is how it shows in stark and unblinking terms the role of violence in supporting the institution of slavery.  Other films have of course shown violence in connection with slaves and slavery, but it is usually episodic - it happens and then it is done with.  None have made the connection so firmly as this one, showing that when one is a slave, violence and the threat of violence are ever present, always lurking beneath the surface, requiring only the slightest impulse or excuse to be unleashed on any slave whom the slave owner, overseer, dealer or in fact any member of the slave-owning class deems deserving of it. In this film, you can see why the institution endured as long as it did, why slaves so seldom rebelled and when they did were so quickly put down, and why, in the end, it had to be ended from outside the system with an even greater level of violence in the form of the Civil War.The film begins in 1841, in Saratoga Springs, New York, where Solomon Northup (Chiwitel Ejiofor in a sure-to-be-Oscar-nominated performance) is a free African-American living with his wife and two children. Solomon works as both a carpenter and as a fiddle player. One day when his wife and children were away on his wife's business, he is introduced to a pair of men (Scoot McNairy and Taran Killam) who work as travelling entertainers and is persuaded to join them on a tour to Washington that they assure him will be quite lucrative.  But once in DC, when their tour is apparently concluded and it's time to settle up, Solomon is tricked into drinking something that soon leaves him insensate and unable to resist.  When he awakes, he finds himself chained to a floor in a strange room, where two strangers enter and inform him that his name is Platt, that he is an escaped slave from Georgia and that he is to be taken to a slave market to be sold.  When he tries to assert the truth of his identity and status as a free man, he is immediately beaten into submission, and beaten again any time he tries to say anything other than the fake identity being forced upon him.Solomon, along with a few other kidnapped victims that include a mother and her two children, is shipped to New Orleans, where he is sold along with the mother, whose children are kept for separate sale, to Lousiana plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch).  Ford turns out to be a relatively benevolent master, and in the hope of getting on his good side so that he might one day try to assert his real identity and status, Solomon assists him by suggesting and ultimately creating a waterway for transporting the plantation's logs swiftly and more efficiently downstream. In gratitude, Ford presents him with a violin, knowing that he can make use of it. However Solomon's efforts backfire on him in that he arouses the jealousy of a white carpenter in Ford's employ, John Tibeats (Paul Dano), who begins abusing him, first verbally and then physically, which pushes Solomon beyond the point of fear and results in his assaulting Tibeats and beating him with his own whip.  From there, things quickly go downhill and Ford, fearing for Solomon's safety, does what he thinks is the only way out and sells Solomon to another plantation owner named Epps (Michael Fassbender in a compelling chewing-the-scenery performance), warning Solomon that Epps is a harsh taskmaster but refusing to hear when Solomon desperately tries to tell him the truth of his identity, claiming that he has a debt to pay. From that point on Solomon's life goes straight to a hell that endures for eleven of the worst years one can imagine.A hard film to watch in places, but nonetheless a highly recommended one for anyone interested in what it meant both to be a slave and to be black during the slavery era.",12 Years a Slave

405375,"There are a number of things that could be focused on in a movie review, but I will focus on the story structure and creativity, since I doubt many have in their reviews of this movie.  It is likely that you already know the story is about 5 kids who get to tour a chocolate factory, but only one has the good character to make it through to the end of the tour.  I hadn't seen the movie for some years, and when I just rewatched it, was very impressed with the imagination of the chocolate factory.  I do not know the book, but I am sure that some praise for the movie's imagination should go to Harper Goff, the art director.  Harper Goff also designed Captain Nemo's ship on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and was one of the primary designers of Disneyland.  (Wikipedia says he met Walt Disney in a London model-making shop, when he and Disney both wanted the same model train.)  In addition, I have always been impressed with the battlefield set on Sergeant York, and it turns out Harper Goff was the set designer for that, too!Besides the chocolate factory's breathtaking beauty designed by Goff, I also love the many imaginative ideas and surprises throughout the factory.  Concerning the story, I found it to be nicely structured, and pleasantly predictable AND unpredictable.  Charlie finding a ticket is something you anticipate will happen, but don't know how.  Later, after the first kid gets eliminated from the tour due to gluttony, you anticipate that a different vice will mess up each remaining contestant except for Charlie.  Yet the story moves in a compelling direction toward higher values than just ""Don't overeat, be polite, don't be greedy, don't watch TV too much"", to honesty and the Golden Rule.  It reminds me of the difference between the Old and New Testament in the Bible, a list of rules and regulations vs. the simple Golden Rule, to treat others as you would want to be treated.  I like it that the Willy Wonka movie moves in that direction.  Everyone else fails because they're self-centered, except Charlie.  Their vices are outgrowths of selfishness.In conclusion, while I find some elements/devices within the story to be illogical or out of place, and sometimes puzzle over Wonka's mannerisms, I find the movie rewarding for its imagination and for moving the theme in a morally progressive direction.  The unpredictability of Wonka is a major source of tension in the story, and its sudden resolution at the end is quite rewarding.  Gene Wilder's performance, for the most part, was quite amusing to me, and he is quite good at wry humor, at combining serious and comedic characteristics into the same role.  And the Oompa Loompa song (I think they're supposed to look like carrots to make you want to eat vegetables) is truly unforgettable, whether you like the movie or not!  I can see why this movie has been watched by as many kids as The Wizard of Oz.  The dazzling colors and feeling of wonder at seeing the candy forest/chocolate river for the first time are so much like The Wizard of Oz.  Not everyone would find the Wonka character appealing, and I didn't until I saw it just a few days ago and understood the ending much better.  But at the very least, this has delightful food for the imagination.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

1454060,"Space Yamato purists will be certain to point out a ton of nitpicks.  This is to be expected when one tries to compress what essentially was a 12 hour story line into 2.5 hours.What they have done is impressive to say the least.  It does a much better job than the original Space Battleship Yamato movie.  The original movie was a 2 hour ""highlight"" reel complete with a bad voice over which said things like ""Yamato went to Jupiter and fought.....Then went to Pluto and fought....Then went to....."".  Very poor indeed and actually almost unwatchable.This new feature doesn't try any of that.  What we are left with is a tighter story line with a lot more continuity with enough plot devices from the first series to be familiar.  I won't spoil it but suffice it to be say, you will easily recognize certain aspects from the first season.What I found even better was how it incorporated some threads from ""Arrivederci Yamato"" as well.  Again, I won't spoil it, but you will see some definite paralells between certain plot devices and that story as well.Overall I really enjoyed it. It is a nice adaptation and the acting is better than I expected.  The production values are also better than I thought.If you are a Yamato fan, and can deal with a little plot manipulation, then you will like this retelling.

196862,"""Murder by Decree"" is an excellent Sherlock Holmes film from 1979  that many people have not seen. Christopher Plummer plays Holmes with intelligence and empathy. For the first time, Dr. Watson is not a bumbling fool. As played by James Mason in ""Decree"", Dr. Watson is the intellectual equal of Holmes. The story is not from the Doyle Canon but is an original story that pits Holmes & Watson against Jack the Ripper. (Note: There was a similar film called , ""A Study in Terror"" with John Neville as Holmes made in England in 1965.) The movie was directed by the Canadian director Bob Clark, who directed ""A Christmas Story"" about Ralphie and the BB gun and the teenage raunch comedy, ""Porky's"" and the film, ""Tribute"" with Jack Lemmon.  Believe it or not, Clark has a nice touch with this Sherlock Holmes story.The movie was nominated by the Canadian film industry for 8 Genie Awards.

1553653,"What a truly admirable person!  San Suu Kyi definitely deserves to be compared to the courageous peace advocates such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mandela.  At great personal sacrifice, she returned to Burma knowing that she was facing hostile, military opposition.  Her many years under house arrest without the ability to even speak to her husband and children in the face of possible murder shows her true faith in her convictions.  Few today, even give thought to doing something on behalf of their fellow citizens without at least a day in the media and an award in it for them.Those who criticize this as a romance really miss the mark and the essence of the movie.  A mother's sacrifice for her country over her most prized things (a loving husband and two great sons) is great.  Ask any woman, who has lost a child!  In fact, though her husband died of cancer, she chose to stay because leaving to be at his side would have prevented her from returning to Myanmar.  Mike (Suu's husband) was an academic advocating for freedom on Asian countrymen, which is how they met.  He, too suffered great loneliness and separation from her house arrest being refused a VISA to visit her.  He didn't tell her of the cancer because he wanted her to stay.  This did not diminish the story.  If you want to see a great movie, it doesn't require John Wayne.  There was quite a bit of murder, guns, and blood on the screen to satisfy the testosterone requirements of most men.My only complaint about this very convincing movie and it is minor, was that the actor, playing the eldest son did not look Asian and Caucasian but rather African and Caucasian.  He had very kinky hair; his skin tone and nose looked more African and likewise he wore a heavy beard, perhaps they were trying to give him a likeness to the father character, but the complexion was to different.  Meanwhile, the younger son definitely had features more appropriate to his heritage.Additionally, the cinematography was excellent. This terrific movie was well acted.  I was not familiar with any of the actors, with the exception of David Thewlis prior to watching but all were convincing.  I was particularly appreciative of Michelle Yeoh's performance,  she gave us great insight into the mind of San Suu Kyi.  Her nuances were subtle and powerful.  David Thewlis is quite talented as well. It makes me want to read and learn more about this woman, I have long admired and supported via Amnesty International.In conclusion, the struggles to fight evil political regimes will always require sacrifice, unfortunately, few are willing or courageous enough to take up a fight risking all!",N/A
1532772,"If you listen to the those who criticize this film you would believe it was an anti-Republican, Liberal spin and its not; in fact the portrayal of McCain is very favorable, you almost feel sorry for him for being saddled with such an unworthy running mate such as Pailin. Pailin is shown in this film to be a woman thrown into the national spotlight without any preparation nor vetting by her own party. She's shown to have little historical knowledge which we know to be true from the many interviews and statements she made during and after the Presidential campaign. She's portrayed as a devoted mother and wife, charismatic yet provincial, narcissistic and emotionally immature. She's represented as a political fighter who suffers from intellectual atrophy, the polar opposite from the traditionally conservative McCain.Moore's performance was outstanding and she nailed many of Pailin's mannerisms and speech. The script if anything attempts to redeem the negative perception of traditional Conservatives who mixed themselves with radical right wingers which lead to the highjacking of their own party. As Jeb Bush has remarked Ronald Reagan nor his own father, George H.W. Bush, would have enjoyed much success in today's ultra-conservative, intensely partisan Republican party, a hint towards the Tea Party movement which Pailin calls her base.'Game Change' is not only fair in its portrayal of Pailin, it also carries a subtextual message warning respected Republicans not to lose their party to elements unworthy of electoral respect.",Game Change

693009,"First off, if you really want this film, you can buy it more cheaply as part of theExtreme Zombies 8 Movie Collection.A teenage boy moves to Grosse Pointe, Michigan. He begins dating a teenage girl. Her biker ex-boyfriend is disenchanted by this turn of events. He and his pals try to beat up the teenage boy. But before they do, some zombies turn this teenager into another zombie -- who then stalks and begins killing the ex-boyfriend's gang. (Well, it's not really a gang -- they're kinda preppy for bikers.)Yes, this film is sorta crappy. It's a low-budget indie effort shot in Michigan. The actors are no-name locals, without any discernible acting abilities. The dialogue is often drab, even for a zombie film. Some of the special effects (e.g., when the cops run over a woman) are inept, but in a hilariously gory, low-budget kind of way.Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed this film. (Admittedly, you have to like home movie quality, grassroots indie horror films.) It's mostly well-paced. Only a few instances of overly long scenes of empty chit-chat. And it's mercifully short at only an hour and 7 minutes (not including end credits -- which run surprisingly long for such a low budget effort.)The ""original score"" by Jeffrey Michael effectively enhances the film's mood. Michael also has a role as one of the bikers. (He's a better composer than actor.)Some scenes are washed-out and flatly lit, but some scenes (the final confrontation between the cops and zombie bikers) have that certain haunting quality which occasionally pops up in low-budget indie efforts. That serendipitous moment when inept, trashy gore collides with an eerily-lit and well-composed shot.One critic said that BIKER ZOMBIES was shot on VHS. I'm not so sure. There's a moment of ""comic relief"" in this film, set in a diner prior to a zombie attack, in which a pretentious film student lectures on the superiority of film over video. So I wonder if BIKER ZOMBIES wasn't shot on 16mm (or even super-8mm) film stock?",Biker Zombies

153772,"First off I had heard the premise for this and thought it was enough to give it a blind buy. I ended up enjoying the movie for several reason, the clever script, Kurt Russel portraying a rather sneeky and more complex character, a pretty good job of portraying a future world that doesn't sound too outlandish, nice humor, good deaths and a nice ending.However there are a couple weaknesses the film posses. It felt like a slow movie, which isn't a good sign as the movie is actually pretty short. Dispite a good amount of stuff happening, the plot never felt like much was at stake. Kurt Russel was 24 hours to live during the movie and yet we keep forgeting that fact. It feels like the idea for this movie would work better as a film novalization rather than an actual film as we would get more from the characters and maybe have a different sense of tone (Then again I've only seen the film once).Finally like with other John Carpenter movies I've seen, they aren't bad at all, but I just can't like them as much as most say I should.

Otherwise it's right on target in many ways that are important.  I recently read The Diary of John Evelyn (a contemporary of Samuel Pepys) as well as some other books about well known figures from the 1600's in England.  I noticed some dialog in the movie that came straight from John Evelyn's Diary.  That was amusing, however the quote I'm thinking of is unprintable in an Amazon review, so I can't type it here, but I knew immediately what the source was when I heard it.  A lot of important things happened in Purcell's life (plague, the Great Fire of London), and many of those changes are noted in the movie.  We may not know a lot of biographical information about Henry Purcell, but this mini-history gives a pretty good outline of what was going on in his time.  Besides, he wrote some of the most gorgeous music ever, much of which you'll recognize even if you're not too familiar with his work.

973687,"This movie looks at a U.S. Army intelligence operation in action during the part of WWII. This operation relied upon former German soldiers recruited from POW camps for missions behind enemy lines. These soldiers were issued new identity documents, orders and other items needed to appear as if they were on leave or in transit to new units. These soldiers would then collect tactical intelligence from within Germany itself (the Front had moved eastward as Germany's fortune faded) and report via radio.Of course, this was a very dangerous job as the Nazi security services were always on the lookout for suspicious-looking documents, German Army units were press-ganging soldiers on leave and in transit in order to bring their own units up to strength and finally there was always the possibility of getting killed by an inadvertant American bomb or artillery shell before returning back to Allied lines.A good drama, filmed in black and white and realistic (when the movie was made German had yet to rebuild from the war) it really sucks you into the story.",N/A
1599522,"I really enjoyed this movie.  The plot was a little thin: bicycle messenger must deliver a letter before a 7:00 pm deadline while being chased by a corrupt cop who wants the letter for himself.  But it was fun, action packed, and the bicycle tricks/culture was a change from the ordinary chase scenes.  The acting was well done, and the characters were interesting.  The corrupt cop was the best of the bunch.  He had this attitude like ""Are you really going to make me kill you?  You know killing you will really spoil my day.  Just do what I want and we will both be happy.""  He was hilarious.Another interesting thing about the movie was the manipulation of the time line.  Characters were introduced and interacted for a time, but then suddenly the story would go back in time and you were shown how and why each character ended up in their current predicament.

1673891,"While this is still going to be a movie review, it's also one of those rare occasions where a massive amount of bias - in this case admiration, will likely overshadow anything and everything that's said about this particular film.  This is due largely to the tragic death of a man that will go down in my book (and many others) as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big or small screen.  Of course, I'm referring to James Gandolfini - a beloved individual that was taken well before his time.  He was a man with immense talent that saw no bounds, starring in arguably the greatest television show of all-time, The Sopranos.  But, before he starred as the loveable gangster, Tony Soprano, he made his everlasting mark in films, like Get Shorty, True Romance, and The Mexican.  Since the conclusion of The Sopranos in 2007, Gandolfini took on much more reduced roles, acting in supporting roles, such as Zero Dark Thirty, Not Fade Away, and Killing Them Softly.  Thankfully, in one of his final roles, he once again takes on a starring role - in the romance film, Enough Said.Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener (Friends with Money, Please Give), Enough Said stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Eva, a divorced single parent working as traveling masseuse.  One night at a party, Eva meets Marianne (Catherine Kenner), a poet with an arm issue that's in need of a masseuse.  At the same party, Eva hits it off with a divorced single parent, Albert (James Gandolfini).  Eva and Albert quickly begin dating, all while Eva is nicely bonding with her new friend and client, Marianne.  It doesn't take long for Eva to discover she is unhappy with men after a bitter divorce - and has no problem criticizing her ex-husband, either.  Matters quickly become complicated when Eva realizes Albert is the ex-husband Marianne is constantly criticizing.  Unsure of how to handle the situation, it's only a matter of time before the whole situation comes to a head.  Toni Collette, Ben Falcone, Tracey Fairaway, and Tavi Gevinson also star in supporting roles.The fact that this is (most likely) James Gandolfini's second to last appearance on the big screen (final appearance will be in 2014's Nicky Deuce), a large shadow looms large over the whole film.  Much like Heath Ledger's appearance as The Joker in The Dark Knight, it's difficult to gage whether Gandolfini's work in the role of Albert is really as good as it appears to be.  I suppose the only way to pull that off would be to find someone that lives under a rock who doesn't know that man died in order to get their unbiased opinion.  Regardless, if James Gandolfini hadn't died, this film would be looked in an entirely different manner.  Still, the devastating circumstances shouldn't discount the performance of Gandolfini's co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus.Julia Louis-Dreyfus is absolutely stunning in this film and despite the cloud overhead, she gives one of the best performances of her career.  Like Gandolfini in the role of Tony Sorprano, I'll still always look at Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine from Seinfeld - yes, even though she just won an Emmy Award for her leading role on Veep.  Regardless, there's no denying her talent for acting (as if her shelf full of Emmy Awards wasn't proof enough).  She brings an awkward, yet relatable quality to her roles, allowing her to stand out as one of Hollywood's most authentic actresses.  Regardless of the character, she simply radiates - exuding charisma and splendor.  The chemistry with her co-stars, like any cast she's ever worked with, is just marvelous - in ways that words just can't describe.  A pairing of Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini may seem like a complete mismatch, yet she sells the audience on the idea that these two characters have something special.While it's easy to see the brilliance of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, it's much harder to look at the character of Albert and not see James Gandolfini.  Albert is a character that's mostly content with his life, and even though he doesn't appear to be looking for love, he's obviously found someone he enjoys.  Gandolfini portrays a down-to-earth working man, and it's really unlike the majority of the role he's played in the past.  He's not a hitman, gangster, or some other form of tough guy.  He portrays a warm, loving individual that is defined by his past, but still attempting to look forward to the future.  For Tony Soprano fans, this role is a tough sell, but this is a different side of Gandolfini that rarely appeared on screen. Regardless, even in this role, it's more evident than ever that he was and always will be considered a dramatic genius.  This wonderful actor has a long reputation of conquering his characters - for better or worse, and even in his final appearances, he gives them that Gandolfini charm that his fans have fallen in love with and adored for so many years.Both Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus shine in these roles due to the writing and directing of Nicole Holofcener.  The characters are written with such a relaxed freedom and honesty, which encourages these two individuals to be open with one another.  But - what's a romantic drama without a little bit of drama.  Sure, the story is all too familiar, but it's executed in a way that you'll have a few laughs, not to mention wonder if Holofcener is trying to send the world a message about obesity.  The impact divorce has on individuals is certainly discussed, along with the fear people have in regards to making the same old mistakes in new relationships.  Holofcener poses an interesting question over the course of this film: would you want the inside dirt on the person you're dating if it helped you avoid making a critical mistake in your life?  It's a difficult concept to wrap your head around, but if you were put in Eva's position and had access to all the bad things someone has ever done, odds are you'd walk the same line she did.Overall, Enough Said is a talk heavy romantic comedy with two stars that initially appear to be an unlikely duo, but as they grow on you over the course of this film (and they will), it will be impossible for you not to approve of their portrayals.  This film is smartly written, well-directed, and features a cast that is nothing less than outstanding.  This isn't a role you'd expect from James Gandolfini, and it's exactly a role you'd expect from Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  And, if this were to be the last film Gandolifini ever appeared in, there would be no finer note to go out on than with this particular character.  Yes, this as a romantic comedy, so it will understandably sway towards the female audience - but even if you're a lover of everything Gandolfini and a hater of most everything romantic-based, you should still give this film your attention.  By the end, you'll be happy you did.GRADE: A-FNDNreview.com",N/A
1436331,"When I quickly realized that this movie was going to be another one of those ""lost footage"" efforts and that it would be shot with one hand-held camera, I started to hit the eject button.I'm glad I didn't.Director Dominic Perez takes this template and revitalizes it into making EVIL THINGS into a moderately scare delight.We're introduced to a car full of All-American college kids--two boys, three girls--who are traveling to a friend's manor out in the snowy woods. On the way, a van begins to play games with them--honking its horn, cutting in front of them and forcing them to drive slow. We sense this is going to be a crucial fear factor later on.But for the next 50 minutes, we watch the photographed antics of the group as they have a birthday party, they sit around and get drunk. The next day they get lost in the snowy woods. Since it's not snowing, one wonders why they couldn't just follow their own footsteps back into the house.All this time we're waiting for SOMETHING to happen and it finally does--heralded by phone calls, a pounding on the front door, a package left on the steps, a videotape made by someone whose gotten into the house at night and filmed them asleep.when the creeper finally comes into the house, the girls all shriek and run upstairs and wait for the boys to protect them. I was surprised that these healthy, strong girls behaved so idiotically. Not only did they do nothing to protect themselves, they never even armed themselves with a butcher knife, a heavy vase, nothing.  They were like throwbacks to women characters in films of the past. They stood by weakly, offering no aide to their male protectors.The movie ends on a disturbing note. We have no idea what happened to the group. While the credits roll, we see curious scenes of a stalker in NYC, and another scene perhaps of the killer, while he watches several TV screens, including the footage he shot in the death house.I'm looking forward to more movies from this director.",Evil Things

320373,"Modern Times is probably one of the most recognized silent films of all time.  Funny thing is, its not really a silent film.  It has many of the major elements of the silent film era, but this movie was released in 1936, several years after talkies were invented.  Sure, its in black and white, the characters don't talk to each other, and Charlie Chaplin reprises his most famous character, ""The Little Tramp"", for the third and final time, but there are small sound parts. This was Chaplin's way of poking fun at talking pictures.To the casual observer, this could be just a funny little story about an average guy (Chaplin), whose heart is in the right place, yet he  doesn't seem to catch a break no matter where he goes or how hard he tries, and a young orphan girl (Paulette Goddard) who steals a loaf of bread and the little tramps heart all at the same time.  But there is a dark side to this film, and if it wasn't for Chaplin's genius in physical comedy and satire, the film could have ended up too bleak to really be entertaining.The movie is about two people who are trying make it in a world where all the odds seemed to be stacked against them.  The music, written by Chaplin is very poignant.  Here we hear the song, ""Smile"".  As it is playing, you begin to hear the lyrics in your head.  (""Smile though your heart is aching; Smile even though its breaking;) In spite of all the grey shaded areas, ""Modern Times"" is a story of hope; hope that can beat down despair.

1446657,"I don't know what I really could add to the plethora of reviews for this series but I at least I can add my own cheers to the chorus.Rick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) stars as a detective caught in a serious bind.  He's a detective with the Portland PD and he suddenly finds out that that he's a grimm and can see supernatural creatures (Wesen) most of whom are ruthless murderers who, when they surge (transform into Wesen), possess incredible strength and speed.  And it seems that just about every other person in Portland is one of these creatures.  At first I thought that housing values must really be low if that's the kind of people they have in Portland because no normal person would dare to live there but then we have Congress so people must be used to frightening creatures.  I digress . . .  The problem for Burkhardt is that he doesn't feel he can tell anyone about what he's seeing and in addition, Burkhardt must start from scratch to learn how to deal with these creatures..The structure of this series is quite good for keeping viewers interested.  There is a multilayer story structure that keeps people interested and looking forward to the next installment of the series.  At the bottom level is plot for the week's show and then there's the storylines that span series installments such as the hidden identity/agenda of Captain Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz), Burkhardt superior, Burkhardt's developing relationship with Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), a reformed Blutbad and Monroe's developing love with Rosalee Calvert (Bree Turner), herself a wesen and reformed drug addict.  And there's Burkhardt's complicated relationship with Juliet Silverton (Bitsie Tulloch) who Burkhardt loves and wants to protect though this proves impossible to do.  She is aware early on that there's something strange going on but not until the end of the 1st season is she able to compel Burkhardt to 'fess up.  Finally, in the last installment of the first year, Burkhardt comes face to face with his mother who is supposed to be dead.Of course it's necessary to somewhat suspend rational thought to enjoy this series because otherwise the series would be, at best, ridiculous.  Consider that Burkhardt is supposed to be able to see wesen, Why then does Captain Renard remain hidden from him?  As of the last of the 1st year, Burkhardt has no clue that Renard is a wesen.  And what about the wesen that are arrested and taken into custody?  Do they never surge when in jail?  Er . . . Burkhardt, there's this teensy little thing you left out of your report . . .Of course none of this really detracts from the series at all and I've already purchased the second season.",Grimm

1475624,"I think I was looking forward to this movie so much that I couldn't possibly dislike it, no matter how hard it tried to make me hate it. And oh, did it try. But I've made my peace with it, and what I've wound up with is a movie that sits close to the top in the Alien franchise, in terms of quality and watchability.For one thing, until the sequel comes out (if it does), I'm treating this like the direct prequel it was supposed to have been until Lindelof put his incompetent hands on it. What's stopping it, apart from a minor technicality of the planet's name being slightly different? Nothing, really. So it's the prequel I was expecting.Other than that, it's just a matter of gritting my teeth and accepting that creating weird imagery that exists solely for the purpose of being weird, no matter the logic behind it (see: the entirety of Lost) is just something that Lindelof does and, somehow, keeps being paid to do. Having done that, I can re-watch this and get almost as much sheer enjoyment as I did the first time I saw it, in the theater. It's much better than focusing on the broken promise of what could (and should) have been, given the talents involved here.But I say that because I want to like it. I need to like it.

1621234,"The film opens up with Madsen narrating as to the cause of the infection: Deer, tics, birds, blood-borne pathogens, inevitable. Later we find out the infection is a mutant strain of Lyme's disease. We then get a quick scene that looks similar to the farmhouse attack in ""Night of the Living Dead"" followed by ""12 hours earlier.""The reason this film does that is because the build up is super slow. Louis Hartley (Michael Madsen) and Dr. Edward Dennehey (William Forsythe) are on vacation in cabins of the woods of Connecticut near East Lyme. They are there to bond with their sons... and get some hunting in. We get to meet wives, girlfriends, neighbors, some people in the woods, and the sick granny who bites the doctor (guess where this goes?)There are time consuming scenes of cooking venison steaks on an open flame and washing them down with the local Narragansett beer, topped off by drinking cognac from a screw top bottle (seriously?). The real action doesn't pick up until the film is half over. About 10 minutes from the end, the film is at a point I had wished it would have been 10 minutes from the beginning.This is not a zombie film per se. The infected people can talk, lie, and have periods of remission where they act normal. Severe symptoms vary from the time of infection. It doesn't take a head shot to kill the infected people as they are not undead.One would think a film with metal music, Madsen, and zombie like creatures would rate a full five stars, no questions asked.

The music score by Trevor Morris is just OK but eventually overwhelmed by the incredibly loud explosions and grinding motor engines persisting throughout the films running time (but that's why we watch this stuff, right?). The Blu-Ray is beautiful in a 1.85 transfer and thundering Dolby Digital sound to rock the cranium.  The races are faster, the deaths are cleverer and it looks like another sequel is in the works with revenge as the catalyst.  Guys, just bring it on.",N/A

It goes behind the scenes of the two campaigns and gives the perspective of each. The movie is somewhat biased toward the Gore campaign, with Kevin Spacey, Denis Leary, and Ed Begley Jr portrayed as working for the Gore campaign but the basic facts of both sides are presented. And with the high class of actors in the movie it is very entertaining as well.

1482424,"I remember sitting in the theatre on August 13th, 2010 on my birthday in eager anticipation of the big, dumb fun to come in the form of Sylvester Stallone's '80&#8242;s action-tribute/ensemble movie, `The Expendables.' Fortunately, it was mostly everything I had hoped for: Big, powerful, bloody, gritty, unapologetic action interspersed with pretty laughable dialogue. Despite how pathetic that film often was whenever people weren't shooting each other, the original `Expendables' was still a good action movie because it nailed the right pacing and was able to etch out the right rhythm of bloody excitement and tough guys awkwardly shooting the breeze. Despite what all the highbrow critics thought, that movie worked both because of and in spite of Stallone's writing. It's sequel, however, does not.Somewhere in all the boringness of watching Stallone's latest cinematic effort, called `The Expendables 2,' I actually paused the movie to find out where exactly my friend and I were in the film because of how little action and how much boring, terrible dialogue there was. After nearly sixty minutes out of the film's 103 minute length, we had had exactly one action scene (all the way back at the beginning), and the rest of the schlock had been nothing more than Stallone's and Richard Wenk's awful, painful dialogue. The film went on for another five minutes or so before we finally got a quick action scene that wrapped up with a incredibly brief appearance of Chuck Norris, although I don't think we actually got to see him shoot anything.This is pretty much what the entire movie is. Although thankfully the snail's pace does pick up a noticeable amount in the movie's final third, most of E2 will simply bore you to tears, and given all the action and star power we were promised (including extended appearances by Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger), that is simply unacceptable. For the most part, the problem is the pacing, as I mentioned. We all knew that the dialogue was going to be bad coming into this, so it wasn't like we were expecting some Shakespearean or Dickensian level of character development or colloquy. That's not my beef with this movie. The problem is that there is just so much of this awful, boring-ass dialogue, and hardly any action at all for the first hour of the film, and when the action finally does pick up in the airport finale, none of the shootouts or hand-to-hand combat match the violence from the first movie. That latter point is not necessarily a huge mark against E2, because the action in the original `Expendables' is pretty damn good, but given the sleep-inducing pace of most of the film, the fact that we are not absolutely blown away by the action when it does happen is disappointing. Really the only action scene that is up to par with the over-the-top violence of the original is in the opening scene.With that said, the action is still better than average, and I will take anything over the awful line delivery and forced jokes that make up most of the movie. I have a hard time deciding which particular conversation is the worst in E2, since they are all pretty awful and there are a lot of them. Some of the terrible jokes stick out more than the regular ""character growth"" moments, though. Dolph Lundgren's pathetic running attempts at comedic relief as a former chemical engineer or a math wiz or a super-genius or something (I don't remember what it was) is pretty bad, but so is the incredibly forced Chuck Norris joke about a cobra. I don't know, it's just all so boring and bad, and the fact that there is just so much of it makes it all the more irritating.As for the film's impressive lineup, that too is letdown. Willis and Schwarzenegger actually do some shooting in this movie, which is a small plus, but we don't see Norris actually shoot a guy on screen until the finale, and Jet Li leaves after the opening battle scene less than half an hour into the movie. And yes, before you interject, Van Damme does something cool...at the very end of the story for three minutes. Jesus, Stallone, if a cast member has less than fifteen minutes of screen time, or kills fewer than ten people, can you please not bill them as a ""starring role?""I don't know. I guess I just feel so cheated by the whole affair, and that's pretty pathetic considering that the action is pretty hard-hitting when it finally occurs (despite being underwhelming compared to the original). The first hour of E2 is so bad, and it's all because we have to watch a bunch of heavily muscled, macho, '80&#8242;s throwback guys pretending to be dramatic actors, when they should've stuck to what they did best and shot first and asked questions later. It would have been better than whatever the hell this is. Don't let people tell you that `The Expendables 2&#8242; is a revamped version of the original '80&#8242;s tribute. It's not. If anything, it's a watered down, lazy, half-assed version of the 2010 flick. It feels eerily like the outtakes from that movie, as if Simon West and Stallone simply took all the unused, cut footage from `The Expendables' and strung it together, and repackaged it to make another movie. It might as well be.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SCORE: 3/10+ The action is pretty solid...- ...when it actually happens. So much of the film is dedicated to boring, lazy, awful, sleep-inducing dialogue that goes on forever. The pacing in E2 is its greatest sin. And it's a big one.- Heck, this movie gets a con just for including that half-assed, pathetic Norris joke and Lundgren's ""super-genius"" gag.- Norris, Van Damme, and Li are disappointingly underused, and Yu is annoyingly overused. Come on guys, really?? This movie was like watching `Rocky V' (1990). Sigh.",N/A

1535096,"At long last, Warner Bros. releases the other half of season 1.  Here's the episodes & reviews for each of them.14. In the Wake of the Mary Celeste: A century ago, the cargo ship Mary Celeste sank under mysterious circumstances. While on an expedition to find the Mary Celeste's remains, Dr Quest discovers what look like crop circles at the bottom of the Sargasso Sea - and a graveyard of ships in an area barren of marine life.  This is an interesting episode, mainly because you never find out what was really going on.  It was a little frustrating when I first saw it, but now I see how mysterious it can be.  B+15. AMOK: On an archaeological expedition in Borneo, the Quest team run into a giant creature, reputed to savagely attack from all directions at the same time. Then they find out that man can be the greater beast...  This is one of the weakest episodes.  Not good, but not bad either.  C16. Besieged in Paradise: Jeremiah Surd taps into, and gains control of, the cetacean communications bandwidth, prodding cetaceans worldwide into savage attacks. The Quest team enlists the help of Captain Havell to stop Surd.  This isn't as good as his first episode, but it's still a fine episode.  B17. The Spectre of the Pine Barrens:  Dr. Quest, Jonny and Hadji head to New Jersey to investigate the Jersey Devil. Then they run into a two-hundred-year-old feud between descendants of the Redcoats and the Minutemen over the original copy of the Declaration of Independence.  This is a great episode, with an interesting premise & some great character moments.  A18. Heroes:  Despite the breaking of its head, the recovery of a statue of Apollo from Greece by Quest Enterprises heralds an important archaeological find--sure to catch the attention of Jeremiah Surd, who has his own plans for the monument.  This is one of the best uses of Questworld ever.  A19. The Ballad of Belle Bonnet:  Centuries ago, a female thief stole a wagonload of gold to help an Indian school stay open, but the gold - and the thief - were lost in vast caverns under the American desert. Jonny discovers that her ghost is still guarding the cache.  This is one of the best episodes of the first season.  A20. In the Darkness of the Moon: A werewolf attack in northern Canada brings the Quest team to investigate. Race finds romance with an attractive outback doctor who turns out to be the last female descendant of a werewolf family.  A mostly boring episode, but the werewolf idea was cool, just not fleshed out nearly enough.  C21. The Secret of the Moai:  Thousands of years ago, the missing link between apes and humans was engineered by aliens possessing auditory DNA-altering technology. When Dr. Quest locates an alien ship in Easter Island, Surd experiments in devolution and turns Dr. Quest and Race Bannon into apes.  The weakest episode on the set.  The story is sort of interesting, but there are too many stupid moments that drag it down.  C-22. Expedition to Khumbu:  Betrayed by a colleague who wants sole credit for proving the existence of yeti, Dr. Quest is all but lost in an avalanche in the mountains of Nepal; when his family begins searching, they are threatened by a similar fate.  This is an excellent episode. A+23. Ice Will Burn:  On a delivery mission for Dr. Quest in Siberia, Jessie Bannon and the Quest Jet fall to the earth and break through the ice to land in a massive underworld, where she is hailed as the one who will restore a volcano's heat.  Another episode that's just there.  C24. Future Rage:  Ezekiel Rage steals a compact thermonuclear device and plans to melt the polar ice caps. The team set out in the Questsled to foil his plan, unaware that the Aurora Borealis in the sky above shall prove their greatest weapon.  This is the weakest episode with Ezekiel rage.  Not because of the story (which is excellent as always) but because of an overly long flashback.  The fact that it's from an episode with a different animation style doesn't help.  But still, the good stuff shines through. A-25. Alligators and Okeechobee Vikings:  Thought to be eco-terrorists, Vikings in alligator suits assault a drilling rig and prompt an inquiry from Dr. Quest. After Jonny and Hadji are lost in an air boat incident, he finds that the Vikings are the least of his problems.  This is a great episode with some good action scenes.  A-26. To Bardo & Back: By watching Jonny practice, Surd learns that the team will be attending a rodeo and uses a mad bull to seriously injure Race. The stakes are increased when Dr. Quest attempts to miraculously repair the damage in Questworld.  This is a great end to season 1.  AI must confess this wasn't as good as the first volume.  But it gets better from here on out, I assure you.  So until next time Quest fans, keep buying copies so that WB will release season 2.",N/A

This movie focuses on one happy foreign family on vacation visiting from Japan.The movie starts very slowly with hardly any dialogue, and at times is filmed as if with a hand held video camera.  Knowing this movie is about the tsunami you know it's not going to be happy for very long and without much wasted time the tsunami quickly hits.  The story continues, long and drawn out.  The movie is quiet, nothing but ruin as far as the eye can see.  Lotst of wasted time and fast forward moments.The movie picks up more when they finally get to the makeshift hospital scenes, but again, not a whole lot happens there either. You aren't provided with much back story, who the people are, or where these hospitals are located. You have no idea where all of the doctors, nurses, and volunteers came from.The wife is on deaths door one minute, goes into surgery and is on an airplane home the next.  No time frames are given.While there isn't much dialogue, there certainly isn't any bad language. There is however, scary moments of being swept away to sea, dead bodies, and open flesh wounds.  Gaping flesh wounds really.I certainly wasn't impressed with this movie.  I learned nothing more about the tsunami, the destruction, the death toll, the miracles, the hope, the survival, the rebuilding, the volunteers, etc.  It seemed more like it was thrown together in haste to be the first movie of its kind to air.  And then of course there were the instances of bad acting.I really wanted to like it, and be especially sensitive to the story subject matter, but I just didn't like it at all.  I would not recommend this one.  Do some research, and find a more accurate, perhaps historical documentary on the tsunami.",Impossible

Too bad the character didn't realize how self-destructive he had become and how urgent help was needed.  I knew how it was going to end when I first saw the car swerve.  This was a joyous movie to watch, with a heartbreaking end.  I was sad to learn that the movie somewhat paralleled Kris's real life.  Too much drink but, he didn't kill himself.  He was a heartthrob and at his prime in this movie. The only thing I didn't care for in this movie was the choice of music that Barbra sang - most of it.

1327278,"Perhaps I read the write up on this wrong, but I was expecting more of a movie (like watching the &#34;Diary of Anne Frank&#34; or something - it's not.  It's a recollection of her, told mostly by her mother with some interview clips thrown in of others involved with her and a mixture of actual footage of events of the war, and &#34;faux&#34; footage (reinactment made to look like old footage).It is a surprising story to me in that she became such a huge, honored symbol (for lack of better words).  She was a Jewish girl from a well-to-do family in Budapest, Hungary.  She was a smart girl, well liked by her classmates as they elected her to office in school - however antisemitism had crept in to the school (where Jews had to pay 3x higher admission) and the school reheld the election to have a non-Jew elected. . . . This was the start of her &#34;wake-up call&#34; and her interest in school went downhill and her interest in moving to Palestine grew.  So, she got herself accepted to an agricultural school in Palestine.  hardly what you'd expect a smart and well-off girl to do, but she figured there were enough smart people - Palestine needed more workers.  A little odd, but...In Palestine, she was &#34;safe&#34; from the German war atrocities against the Jews, and as it turned out Budapest was still unoccupied - a final holdout for the Jews, but she saw the writing on the wall and knew she HAD to get her mother out, and anyone else she could -- now.  So she joined a group and trained to parachute into Hungary and they were going to start getting Jews out and strengthening resistance efforts, etc.  They arrived too late. They parachuted in days outside of Budapest and the Germans invaded within a few days of their landing. They were unable to do anything.She got caught before she could help even 1 person..  So in a sense, she didn't accomplish anything and you wonder why she ended up being so famous, so revered. ....  She had key information the Germans wanted and took her punishments instead of turning over the info.  Somehow within the prison where she was being held she became loved and revered, but this didn't really explain why to my satisfaction.  I guess she was a shining example of holding out a flicker of light to those who were desperately seeking one in the darkness of the times.....It was interesting, not at all what I expected... and while she seems to be someone to admire for her strength and courage, she did have an &#34;out&#34; -- she could've saved herself (so this show says) knowing that the city was being liberated and it was only a matter of a few days....  I didn't really understand why she chose to bravely go down at that point.  I think I missed something.  I'm thinking there were MANY people who were the strong flickers of light during those times, in many places --- how SHE in particular became so famous/special for it I still don't know.If you just love every chunk of info about the Jews and WWII and stuff, you might want to see this . . . but for me, it was interesting but I almost feel like I wasted my time on this.

Initially I was a little wary about the series because of the political correctness attached to the show like Starbuck being a woman, the Cylons being previous slaves of humanity, etc but the show came off as spectacular !!!

Kate Winslet is the heroine of the smaller mystery.I was surprised Alan Turing is not even mentioned in the film.

1395008,"I saw this movie in the theatre and liked it enough to buy.  Which was actually pretty surprising, since I cringed at the title...Cowboys and Aliens, are you kidding me?  Yet, I love Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, so I thought what the heck?Actually, this a fairly decent movie all things considered.  Daniel Craig's character, Jake, wakes up all alone and not knowing who he is.  Things rapidly go from bad to worse as he heads into town and finds he is a wanted man.  Harrison Ford's character, Col Dolarhyde, has a jerk for a son who also ends up in jail at the same time.  They are do to be shipped off for justice when...OMG, alien ships show up and ""lasso"" some of the townsfolk, stealing them for who knows what diabolical purpose.A possee is rounded up, headed by Col Dolarhyde and a reluctant Jake, who happens to have the only weapon known to bring down the bad guys, even if he doesn't know how he happened to end up with it.  Also included in the possee is a girl, a preacher, a kid, and a dog...and they later encounter outlaws and Native Americans.  There are gunfights and men and boys growing up and learning how to find their bravery in the face of terrible odds.  There is the wounded hero in Harrison Ford's character, who learns his own lessons along the way.  There is the love of gold.  There is honor and hope and hardship and a hint of humor and irony.  How much more Western can you get?Because this IS a Western, despite the aliens.  It also shows that, when the chips are down, human beings will band together against an outside threat no matter their previous differences.Daniel Craig does a great job in this as the stranger who has lost his way only to find it again.  Harrison Ford is even better, as the craggy old man who's seen too much death and betrayal, only to find he still has a heart of gold under it all.  The minor characters also have their own passages to undertake and it all meshes together along the way.This is not my favorite movie, I must admit.  But its not bad.  You have to love Westerns, though...otherwise this can come across as just a sf movie with a strange twist.",Cowboys & Aliens

1627643,"It's late afternoon in Washington DC, terrorists have taken the White House, and the body count is rising by the second.  Olympus Has Fallen certainly has an attention-grabbing premise, but more often than not fails to deliver on its potential.The film opens at the presidential retreat Camp David, where we are introduced to Mike Banning, a Secret Service agent and personal friend to the president's family.  While Olympus Has Fallen allows us to take a few minutes to get to know its cast, Director Antoine Fuqua's style lets no moment linger, and the film quickly propels into high gear.  While leaving Camp David, there is a major car accident that Banning fails to prevent, leading to the death of the First Lady, and his expulsion from the Secret Service.A year and a half later, Banning is now working at a desk job, which everyone in Hollywood knows is the least fulfilling avenue of work anyone could possibly choose.  He's clearly defeated and still depressed over his past failure, but his chance for redemption comes from an unlikely source - a full-scale terrorist attack on the most heavily defended building in the world.  In what is undoubtedly the film's best scene, terrorists both in the air and on the ground manage to breach the White House's defenses and hold the president hostage in his bunker, with Banning managing to trap himself inside the building as well.From here on out, it's a fairly typical Die Hard scenario - one man against everyone else in the building.  It sounds like it would work, it ought to work, but it unfortunately doesn't.  Where Die Hard's John McClane would more often than not barely escape an encounter with a bad guy without all his bones broken, Banning much more closely resembles a straight-up super soldier.  Any encounter with terrorists inevitably ends in their being beaten within seconds, which robs the film of a lot of its potential tension.  Frankly, the entire film loses tension simply because of how trigger-happy it is.  Rarely has a major film featured so many on-screen deaths, both of civilians and political figures.  After two straight hours of such wanton violence, it completely loses its impact.The acting is good, with several big names doing a great job, but the casting ultimately feels like the film is playing it safe.  Morgan Freeman plays Speaker of the House Allen Trumbull with a beleaguered demeanor that you would expect of someone forced to take the office of president during such a crisis.  Ultimately, though, it's basically the role we've come to expect of Freeman - no surprises here.  Aaron Eckhart plays the president, and again, it's a fairly predictable performance for anyone who remembers Eckhart as Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight.  Only Gerald Butler, who plays Banning, adds any sort of nuance to his role, and that's frequently just due to how convincing he is as a man seeking redemption for past failures.While Olympus Has Fallen is frequently fun, it often feels like a missed opportunity.  Despite its undoubtedly large budget, its A-list cast, and iconic location, it rarely rises to any higher level than ""average"".",N/A

1665053,"This special edition of the popular Disney Junior series, the equivalent of four individual stories on the daily show, marks the first appearance of Tinker Bell in this particular Peter Pan &#8220;universe.&#8221;It begins as Jake joins his crew on the beach; where they&#8217;ve set up a picnic&#8212;of healthy, nutritious foods&#8212;and objects start disappearing. Jake learns that he alone must go on a quest to find the Forever Tree and get the Destiny Sword from Destiny Mountain.The storyline is secondary to the fact that, all the while, Jake is helped by the &#8220;Guardian of Never Land,&#8221; whose disguise only obscures him partially, making it pretty easy for little ones to figure out who it really is.I just realized that this series&#8217; interactive aspect, in young viewers are asked to participate as they watch, actually can be traced back to the famous scene J.M. Barrie&#8217;s original 1904 play, when theater audiences were asked to clap to save Tinker Bell. So Dora and Blue&#8217;s Clues did not do it first! As far as I can remember, though, the idea that pixie dust stops working when it gets wet seems to have been invented for this series in order to give Captain Hook more ways to lose out in his schemes.In addition to the extras on the disc listed below, there&#8217;s a keen inflatable Sword of Destiny inside the package. This is very much like a toy I loved as a kid called &#8220;Blimps.&#8221; These were yellow plastic animal shapes that came in a cube with crayons and a straw. You could color the animals and use the straw to blow them up and play with them&#8212;the erase the crayons with a cloth. This sword has a little straw just like Blimps, only there are little stickers for decoration, which can be peeled off. So it&#8217;s the toy that keeps on giving!

1671550,"Warning: if you're new to Homeland be sure to watch every episode in order starting with season one. I love serialized television but the only problem is if you watch something out of order it spoils a lot of the episodes that preceded it. So be sure to start with season one you will not regret it.Before I talk about season three I want to say if you have a chance to watch this in high definition on Blu-ray I highly recommend it. Nowadays things are shot in high definition and they look so much better and Homeland is a sterling example of that.Homeland is one of the shows that gets put under the microscope people complain about continuity and story or the science behind what the CIA can or cannot do. And I'll admit I sometimes stop at the implausibility of what I see in the show. The sad thing is that sometimes people I over analyze it to where the show just falls apart. I mean yes to me some of the things that they portray as happening or people doing are ridiculous but it's just a TV show. at least those kind of moments offer a time for you to yell your television and question how much of a brain certain characters have. With that said I think season three has been a good ride I think a few of the episodes in the middle that deal with Dana, were a little drawn out but Danan is a big reason Brody does what he does.But I'm somebody who loved season one so much that I think it may be my favorite 12 episodes of television ever.

600370,"Surely everyone has watched at least one episode of this ubiquitous program by now. From 1990 to 2010, it was a must-see on tv, and has since achieved immortality through reruns on multiple channels. Apparently that wasn't good enough for me, as I just bought the entire first season and watched all 22 episodes in order. Ahhh! First, the price can't be beat - 22 beautifully acted shows for a mere $14.99. Second, that terrific acting was performed by both seasoned and novice people whose careers have often blossomed in the years since then. In one, I was delighted to see a young Ice-T doing a very neat break-dance. Third, the writing is great. A lot of the episodes are &#34;ripped from the headlines&#34; with interesting spins. The photography is rather grainy. I believe this was done deliberately to emphasize the gritty nature of police work. The precinct is as shabby as any stereotyped cop shop. There are almost no special effects; the storyline and acting carry each show without any need for flash and dazzle. I think a really good reason to watch this is to see the beginning of the iconic series. People who were more accustomed to recent incarnations of it, such as S. Epatha Merkerson as the Captain, would be surprised to see her first appearance in Season 1 as a widowed mother whose baby was killed. Viewers of Law & Order: SVU who know Dann Florek as Don Cragen can see his early career as Captain in the parent series. Chris Noth, who later wound up in Law & Order: Criminal Intent, is a hot-headed (and very handsome) detective here. There were no bad episodes. No mediocre episodes. Each and every program is wonderful, and a few are true stand-outs. I highly recommend this. Consider: I've been watching Law & Order for 23 years, and I've never become tired of it. I've seen these episodes numerous times, and enjoyed them just as much now that I bought the whole first season. I can hardly wait to view Season 2!",Law & Order: The First Year

1540549,"*This may contain spoilers*In 2004, I received a phone call from my friend who told me that Intensity by Dean Koontz was on TV. The reason she called me is because that same year I've been urging her to read Intensity. She's not much of a reader, and opted to see the movie instead. She said the movie was great. But in my opinion,  movies are notorious for not doing the book any justice so I reserved my judgement. Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it at the time. In the ensuing months and years, I've searched for this movie without any success. Since I loved the book, I wanted to see the movie. Last week, I stumbled on it here on Amazon and quickly ordered it. So this is my opinion:The movie is good. So if you loved/liked the book, then you'll like/love the movie. Unlike other book-to-movie adaptations, this one adhered to the storyline without colossal deviations. Some of the deviations are as follows: Jack Templeton is single and had dinner with the family, whereas in the book he is married and couldn't make it to dinner. Ariel's hair is brown instead of platinum blonde. Vess listens to music on his way back home, whereas in the book he doesn't turn on the radio. There were wolves instead of elk. Some of the somewhat major deviations were the involvement of the sheriff and a woman on that lonely stretch highway. Vess visited the Templeton's because of Jack and not Laura, whereas in the book Vess was motivated by Laura whose picture he saw by accident. It would've been nice if there weren't any deviations, since I'm a stickler for details, but overall I thought this movie was pretty good.The acting by John McGinley was great. I never pegged him for a guy who could do serious roles, especially after I've seen his performance on Scrubs, but he really nailed it. Molly Parker played her role pretty well. The actress who played Ariel was exactly how I pictured her, minus the brown hair.The ending is slightly different than the book, but I didn't mind it so much. The ending was still good. It even made me shed a tear.In my opinion, no movie can do any book justice, but this adaptation cuts it pretty close. If you liked/loved the book, you'll like/love the movie.",N/A

And,yes, there is much violence, and the Crucifixion scene is difficult and heartbreaking to see, but I feel it is critical to include these execution horrors when its depiction is so common today.

515870,"A thoroughly enjoyable primer on entertainment as immigrant America was coming of age; I am revising my review due to the fact that after watching it for the third time I enjoy this DVD more each time.  I am a show biz history buff who liked burlesque, carnival, circus. When you look at the humor and ""girl show"" acts in Burlesque it is pretty tame by todays standards.  While burlesque was more in the tradition of British Music Hall I think Vaudeville evolved as a unique American art form that insisted upon ""sunday show"" standards Tony Pastor (imho the founder of true Vaudeville) instituted.I would invite anyone who acquires this fine documentary to simply watch the clips of the Nicholas Bros. who imho make this easily worth the price of the video.  The film in addition to discussing Vaudeville that was the norm in the ""tank towns"" the subject of segregation and Yiddish theater are given attention as well.  Purchasers will find it interesting to see former Vaudeville stars like Rose Marie and others who made the transition to the movies and TV.One final thought is that while some of the clips are brief, one can see acts like the Nicholas Bros. on youtube; these two chaps never made it to the silver screen in a big way because they made fine performers like Astaire and Gene Kelly look weak!!  These two overlooked performers rate a documentary of there own!  Never have I in over 40 years of my study of show biz have I seen an act like the Nicolas Bros.

I also realize the movie is about a low budget film crew but just because that's the plot doesn't mean they only have to hire bad actors. Not only is the fake movie low budget and bad acting, the actual movie is low budget and bad acting. It's hard to knock the movie based on budget but there comes a point where you have to realize that acting does matter, even in really low budget throw away movies like this. The rest of the movie was pretty much cookie cutter and not that scary to me. If you are a hardcore horror fan you may like this, I did not.

1510229,"It is great to finally see Dennis Quaid play a character with personality again! Lately, it seems like he plays the same scarred, emotionless character, over and over again. It's hard to remember that it's his charisma that made him a star and you can really see it in Beneath The Darkness. Dennis Quaid plays Vaughn Ely, a mortician who is bat shit crazy. To the town, Ely is this great guy who gives back to the community, but only one person can see him for what he really is. Travis (Tony Oller) is a local teenager who works odd jobs for Ely and has always had suspicions about the man, but never did anything about it. One night, the subject comes up while with his friends and they decide to bust into Ely's home to find out what he's really hiding. The story starts out very slowly and I wasn't expecting it to get any better, but it really does. I already mentioned how good Quaid is, but the star of this film is Tony Oller. I've heard him sing, but I've never seen him act, and to say I was impressed is an understatement. Between Quaid's outlandish behavior and Oller's teenage angst, I didn't need much of a story to follow in order to be entertained. Beneath The Darkness is strange and not everyone is going to like it, but it's one of these films that you keep watching, because you want to know what's going to happen. What happens is that it actually turns into a pretty entertaining and respectable film, that features a star in the making.",Beneath the Darkness

It may be rather grotesque , it is a superficial, an external perspective on drug nevertheless succeeding to communicate a certain energy , a collective delirium, grotesque and funny situations . Although, there left something ridiculous and childish in acting. The roles are exaggerated and everything turn around the central character Ewan who should be considered charismatic , I think.Till this absurd end where everything is mixed .

585947,"The genre of animation has grown quite a bit in the last couple of decades. When movies like Finding Nemo came out years ago we got to experience how much could be done with this genre. As more and more films came out the law of averages prevailed, some were good, some were pretty bad, and only a few were truly great. That is why I stopped watching everything that came out in this category and tried to concentrate on those I thought were gems. I am not sure why I never got around to watching this movie, but now I realize that I was missing out all these years.Let's start with the biggest plus I found. The story is absolutely enthralling, with a plot the overflows with imagination and provides the audience with a nice combination of laughter and tender moments. There may be a few scary moments for little kids, but these are truly few and far in between, and as soon as they figure out that the monsters are actually more afraid of the kids than the kids are of the monsters, it goes away.The voice acting is what actually takes this film to the next level. John Goodman and Billy Crystal deliver with their voices better performances than many actors can deliver when acting themselves in films. The inflection in their voices, cadence and emotion provide the story with an added layer of awesomeness. Finally, the animation and graphics are really stunning, with smooth action, spectacular level of detail and vivid colors.I regret having waited this long to watch this one, if you are in the same boat I was, stop dilly-dallying and watch it now.

508221,"Jean Rollin was never a good film maker, he is an artist with an artist's eye.  The best asset a film maker has is to know what works and what doesn't and edits, artists don't edit. The writing is always interesting but the poor script skills hinder a director.  What talent he lacked as a film maker was made up for with his artist's eye.  He has an artist's eye for recognizing beauty in the female form, not as easy as you think.  His artist's eye is also on display in his films with the images and settings.  Jean Rollin recognized his lack of talent as a film maker, there is not a lot of dialogue, he predominantly told his stories with the visuals, although you can tell he thought of himself as a poet also, some of the dialogue in his movies is practically prose.  As a matter of fact many characters who appear throughout a movie might only have a sentence or two in the whole movie.There is no doubt that the only reason much of his early stuff even makes it to film is the nudity and realizing the sexual fantasies of many regarding horror films.  He took the nudity and sexual fantasies past the point where other horror films stopped.  Much of what he does in his films you would not even see in porn now days after their self imposed restrictions in the late 70's with the advent of video tape and the subsequent fear of a government crack down of the industry.  This is why you don't see rape in porn.  Some of the early porn videos had rape scenes.The story in Shiver is not bad but leaves a lot to be desired as a script.  The story's true purpose is to realize his desire for nudity and the aforementioned sexual fantasies.  The only worthy thing about Shiver is the beauty of Sandra Julien and the images and settings.  I imagine much of the setting doesn't even exist anymore.  Jean Rollin must have done a lot of driving around to find his settings.

1647551,"Now You See Me, the hit caper thriller fromLouis Leterrier, and serves up the most fast-paced, glitzy, action-packed, twisty-turny, fun, crowd-pleasing cocktail imaginable...but forgets to make any of it make sense. The CONS of Now You See Me, and then PROS are conjured up by me below. AlakaZAM! Let us begin.CONS:  Breezy fun as it might be, when the movie tries to be serious it fails miserably. When the movie races at fast-pace, giving us sleight of hand, impossible feats of magic, and witty banter, all is fine and dandy. When Now You See Me tries to explain itself logically, it comes off as trying too hard. As Michael Caine says in The Prestige, we _want to be fooled. But we don't want to be cheated, and the admittedly unforseen twist ending was shocking for one breathless second, until we realized how extraordinarily unlikely, impossible, and silly it actually was. And also, the use of CGI for magic is a dubious choice. When we know what we are seeing onscreen was generated by computers and some greenscreen, it's harder to feel amazed and awed by the spectacular tricks.PROS: But hey, I'm taking this too seriously! NYSM is the perfect film for a night of carefree entertainment. Now You See Me combines healthy doses of action, humour, twists and turns, suspense, and a fresh sense of fun to make one of the rare original but engaging blockbusters out this year. It's no wonder Now You See Me was a surprise hit, outgrossing The Lone Ranger and Pacific Rim in the States.It's success is due in no small part to it's talented and diverse cast.Jesse Eisenbergplays smug, difficult know-it-alls like he was born to, and his illusionist J. Daniel Atlas is right on the money.Woody Harrelson's obnoxious mentalist Merritt is one of the highlights of the film. In the supporting cast, Isla Fisher shows her talent and charm and Dave Franco is charming and cool as a pickpocketing magician.Mark Ruffalohas little to do but look confused and be ten steps behind everything else, but his final twist gives him some gravity, and he's got most of the funny bits. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are woefully underused. Not once did Caine ask if we were watching closely. But Caine is a remarkably suave gent, and Freeman makes every movie he's in 33.33% better. Quote me on that.By no accounts a truly GREAT film, Now You See Me successfully treads the thin line between silly and utterly entertaining by welcoming and embracing it's own silliness straight out of the door. You should even have such a great time that you forget that the plot is nonsensical and the twist at the end makes no sense. So come in close, because the more you actually see, the easier it will be...to have a great time at the movies.My rating? 4 of hearts out of 5.",N/A

Then we have a thriller when a discredited doctor starts to see a different picture. Is he being paranoid? Is his own downfall making him clutch to straws. Then there is the patient and double victim of a terrible crime. It is a fresh prespective to see a thriller from someone else than a cop, lawyer or news reporter. It could have been a brilliant film. The problem was with the pace of the story. Slow it was but the worst part was that the introduction took up the first 50 minutes of the film, that is to say before it became a thriller. The story before that is of a seriously depressed woman coping with her life. Even once the thriller begins it is slow. There is a lot of good elements in there but it lacks the pace to make it engaging.",N/A

The Bluth family, which is the subject of this series, is at the same time the funniest and most dysfunctional family ever grace the airwaves. The show lampoons a lot of different things, the humor is sometimes silly and broad, other times so intelligent you almost miss it (and that's sometimes the funniest of all)Although you could start anywhere in the series, I would urge you to start with  Season 1, Episode 1, and work your way through.

1545242,"Like printing a picture on a playing card, the mind creates a ""card"" for every special moment in a person's life, whether or not it was emotionally felt or realized at the time.  In this film the cards of a man's life are shuffled through in search for self understanding and direction.  The cards are especially valuable because they also offer emotional compensation during challenging times.  In one case, the cards saved a man's life when he got into a car accident.  In another, the cards provided comfort to a 92 year old man just before passing as he got to relive his most cherished memory - the moment of falling in love for the first time with his childhood sweetheart.I think the appeal of this film is that it is easy to relate to the protagonist's relationship to his memories.  For example, when he gains some life experiences and his mind creates cards for them, it is only after years or decades that he is able to really feel them in his body and connect them to his awareness.  To paraphrase King Lear - ""He sees them feelingly.""  Another problem solving puzzle-like aspect of this film is how the cards are able to guide a man in healing from a traumatic event.  In turns out that he had an angel within him all along.I imagine that there are a number of folks living in retirement homes who are shuffling through their memory cards and I think they in particular will find this movie to be a source of validation.",N/A

1121899,"The History Channel produced this documentary about the crazy and chaotic year of 1968 that is hosted and narrated by NBC's Tom Brokow.  Mr. Brokow describes the events of the year beginning with the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy.  The chaotic Democratic National Convention in Chicago which really was a clash of generations.  NASA sending men into outer space, the great concert of WoodStock, the Olympics in Mexico City with the famous ""Black Power"" protest, the burning of bras by women, the drug influence from marijuana to LSD...Timothy Leary, The Smothers Brothers controversial Television show...The crazy and historic events go on....There are good commentaries and interviews with those who were influenced by 1968 such as Arlo Guthrie, Olympic Athlete Rafer Johnson, Tommy Smothers (of the Smothers Brothers), political commentarian and commedian Jon Stewart, and Former Mayor of Atlanta Andrew Young who was in Dr. King's inner circle, and the great rock singer and poet in song Bruce Springsteen.1968 was the year that President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run for re-election, he knew America's mood about the War in Vietnam, he knew that he physically could not go on the re-election campaign, and he knew that another 4 years in the White House would literally kill him.  In 1968 he faces his demons and did the right thing by announcing that he would not run for re-election.  Then came the 37th President of The United States Richard M. Nixon who brought in a more ""conservative"" attitude to the White House and 5 years later he too faced his demons and resigned from the Presidency.  This is a good DVD about that pivotal year that either hurt or helped America forever (according to your political beliefs and who you listen to)...I recommend this for all who want to know what the 1960's were really like...the Good...the Bad...and The Ugly of the 1960's...Highly Recommended!",1968 with Tom Brokaw

870,"What struck me -- Christ was condemned by the ""democratic"" mob, while few ""aristocratic"", more gentle individuals tried to save him. My long suspicion is that mercy is an aristocratic value. Christianity appeals to this ""aristocracy of the spirit"", which is often a gentler spirit. No wonder that many original Christians and early Christian martyrs were women.  You don't need to be a Christian to feel for Christ's suffering so graphically (perhaps too graphically) depicted in the film. It is violent, not hiding behind pretense. It will be disapproved by the modern Western progressives who believe that the human kind is inherently good. They think only a bad governance or dictators (like Hitler or Stalin) make it bad. Actually, Christ's radical message was the reverse. The human nature is seriously tinted. Special effort is needed to make us love one-another -- not somebody of the same tribe or family - that would be easy, but the enemy. How is it even possible? We are to love all men in spite of the fact they are sinners partially because we know we are sinners ourselves. This message is radically different from the organized systems of self-righteousness embodied in nationalism, religious camps, and political parties. They would not hesitate to crucify Christ again. Christianity never ceased challenging human illusions. The best of it preaches religion of the spirit, other-worldly, preaching charity and humility, trusting Providence and submitting to it, and setting its heart and its treasure in heaven. Whereas other heroes may imagine they can liberate the whole humankind, Christ was more concerned with individual human souls. And there is a question of mercy and the state. Seems to me, mercy is an aristocratic value, it is opposite to the self-righteousness and drive for revenge, which are the things of democratic mob. I'm deeply skeptical about the ability of modern state apparatus to understand its enemy, or even the ally, because the state has already rendered judgement as to the purity of its own intentions. I'd probably have preferred myself a less brutal, slightly more gentle and nuanced film, but I think this one is very good, powerful film.",N/A

263432,"I haven't actually bought this from Amazon, but felt like reviewing it as its one of my favourite films. The film stars Patrick Bergin and Iain Glen, who are Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke respectively, and its set in the mid-19th century when Africa was still largely unexplored and called 'the dark continent'. Most British people I suspect, until this movie came out, had not heard of Burton or Speke, and are probably also a little ignorant of the mid-Victorian period to be honest.The film is about high adventure in Africa, oneupmanship at every turn, the clash between ideas and different cultures, and ultimately a friendship that turns sour, amongst other things. Burton was a brilliant intellectual and linguist who knew lots of different languages fluently and was also a sexual adventurer and a bit of a lad to be frank; a man in some ways out of his time. Speke was essentially an upper-class gentleman with more establishment connections than Burton, and its hinted in the film that he is gay and finds Burton attractive. Anyway, that aside, the film is brilliantly shot and produced, and although an exciting romp through Africa to get to the source of the Nile, there are enough sub-plots and sidelines and little stories to keep you interested. And the music? The music is masterful and powerful and draws you into the film; I think if a good film has good music, the film can become great. Just look at the Godfather. Anyway, I highly rate this film, and if you like things about high adventure, Victorian explorers and all the romance that goes with that, you should get this film.",Mountains of the Moon VHS

The writers of the current Lewis series very nicely come full circle and wrote a script that brings the unfinished business in Morse and Lewis' relationship to a closer relationship between Lewis and Hathaway. That pairing of stories is very nice. Again I applaud Colin Dexter's creation of characters as a mystery series that brings the amateur detective of the Agatha Christie vein to the professional police detective and bridges the older style detective fiction with the modern police procedural to create a very satisfying story form. The writers and creators who have taken the characters further and added Hathaway to the mix have kept the spirit and brilliance of the original without feeling the need to totally change the style and characters.

His... er... unique sidekick, Minion (a fish in a bowl connected to a giant robot gorilla body) is as lovable as poor Megamind.I am writing this review to try and be helpful, but I've found that everyone's taste in movies is like their taste in food: What one person absolutely loves, another may find impossible to swallow.  By no means is Megamind hard to swallow (although I did find myself &#34;choking&#34; on the movie, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs), and I cannot imagine anyone not liking this movie, but you just never know.If anyone remembers the Disney film, The Little Mermaid, you must remember Ursula the Witch. Remember how scary she was? I had brought my 3-year-old to see a happy little movie and was incredibly surprised that they put such a scary image in an otherwise delightful and harmless movie. You won't get surprised like that by this film. However, if your child might be freaked out by little flying robots with steel chompers (Megamind's pets) just be warned. They only appear for a few seconds 2 or 3 times in the movie.",Megamind

It caused a type of mental ""claustrophobia"" wherein this segment of the pilot's life was like looking through a keyhole, instead of through a window; it was not a broad enough storyline to place in some sort of context. Whether or not that was the intent of identifying the process of addiction or not, it made for a grim movie start to finish. The acting was okay, but story so narrow that there wasn't much room for a more multi-layered character piece. Goodman's overt over-the-topness was just plain getting-on-your-nerves'ness. Denzel's twitches and stumbles were not believable. All-in-all, I was not convinced or engaged; just couldn't wait for it to be over.

1656463,"just why is it that the judgements of the professional critics are so often so unreliable?well, like most riddles in this world, i daresay we're not gonna get anywhere looking for easy ""pat"" answers. but one key element is that for some reason they never seem to believe in middle-ground. everything is always either a wonderful masterpiece or a colossal turd. that's one reason for why THE LONE RANGER was the most maligned and persecuted film of the year.the other reason, the poor box office performance and money it didn't make, is alas more tangible. but as i've mentioned in such other reviews as THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION and THE SHADOW, quality of product and box office performance are NOT the joint factors some would like you to think.so what about THE LONE RANGER? yes it is an imperfect film, most obviously in being a good 15 or 20 minutes longer than it really needed to be. but hey, haven't we all seen films which had their flaws, or which took directions other than those we ourselves would've taken, and enjoyed them anyway? pure an' simple, this is one of those films that should've been applauded and celebrated, but were defeated by rumor and resultant juggernaught. i can't help but remember that the audience i saw the film with in the theatre were havin' a gay ol' time.as our hero first arrives, returning from law school, it turns out he's been softened into a ""tenderfoot"" and has to relearn how to live in the West. this may not fall in line with the Clayton Moore version, but it works in it's way. Armie Hammer's portrayal has an ""everyman"" quality that Moore never had, and where Moore's take was a ready-made ""champion of justice,"" here circumstance has to gradually mold John Reid into a hero. so however else Hammer compares to Moore, there's something profound and poetic here that the Clayton Moore series can't offer you.the liberties it takes with Tonto are on shakier ground. simply put, the ""faithful Indian companion"" as portrayed by Johnny Depp has his ""issues."" there's a certain poignancy to his lingering guilt concering a major screw-up from his childhood, but it could well of turned him into a loony. there's a majesty to his suggestion that Lone Ranger-to-be John Reid is an enchanted ""Spirit Walker"" destined by prophesy to bring law and reason to the untamed frontier, but this of course turns out to be delerium. and of course his choice of headwear (a dead bird) isn't exactly precedented. but the good news is that, as does Hammer with the Ranger, Depp does prove to have as much nobility and reliability lurking somewhere in his version of the character as had Jay Silverheels so many decades before. also, Depp brings a surprising charm to his scenes with a young fan at a carnival in 1933. (the year the original radio series premiered, for those of you who don't know their homages.)the story itself is admittedly convoluted in spots, but it has a wonderful Western flavor on the whole. it may be a bit louder and more rambunctious than was altogether necessary, but not unlike VAN HELSING, it offers something worthwhile if you'll look past all that bombast. if nothing else, Depp and Hammer have, maybe not absolute chemistry, but some degree to be sure.i can't help but reflect upon the 1981 film THE LEGEND OF THE LONE RANGER. that rather understated production might seem a few hundred miles removed from this Jerry Bruckheimer extravaganza, but the two do have one significant thing in common: LEGEND too was maligned and a box office failure, again for no more substantial reason than because the juggernaught had started rolling against it. (the most cited point against it, after all, is that it's star, one Klinton Spilsbury, never managed to make another film appearance. which of course doesn't have a great deal to do with the movie itself.) yet that film survived to be readily available on DVD today, so i daresay there's hope for this version to enjoy similar staying power.if Superman can work on both the modest television budget of George Reeves and in the epic cinematic grandeur of Christopher Reeve, if Sherlock Holmes can be represented in both B-movies starring Basil Rathbone and lavish period productions starring Jeremy Brett (to say nothing of ballsy updates starring Benedict Cumberbatch), why can't The Lone Ranger be just as flexible?let he who has never enjoyed a film in spite of it's imperfections and/or box office failure cast the first stone!!",The Lone Ranger

1404064,"I have to admit, I'm not the biggest Final Destination fan but I have watched the first and the second and I love them both. I heard it started going downhill after and I'm starting to believe it. If people are willing to give this movie a 5 star review then that can only mean the last two must have been extremely awful because this one is the easily and by far the worst Final Destination movie I've seen. Let me rephrase that: this is the only Final Destination movie I've seen that I didn't like. If you've seen the first and the second (or just the first is enough), then you won't be surprised, you won't be engaged, you won't even be interested in knowing what happens next as it's so obvious. Characters are uninteresting and straightforward. Movie does not even attempt to add anything extra to the series and seem to be more like a remake (or spiritual replacement) of the first movie. Put it this way, story and character wise is plain boring (unless this is your first entry into the series).With all that said, reason why I'm giving this a 2 star compared to a 1 star is the first action scene and the 3D effects. Both were pretty well. The first scene won't blow your mind away but it was definitively entertaining to watch. The use of 3D effects really added a lot to the scenes of interest and I think it had one of the best uses of it. Although out of the movie, maybe you get 15-20 minutes of good 3d action.Conclusion: If you watched the first or the second movie and you don't care about 3d, I highly recommend skipping this movie. Not worth your time. If you've never watched a Final Destination movie then this one could be interesting for you. If you only care about 3D, maybe wait till the price drops to $5-10 or something.",Final Destination 5 (DVD)
1673191,"Luc Besson&#8217;s latest movie &#8220;The Family&#8221; is typical example of a film where a wealth of great talent is wasted on the thin material. The film has a great cast of actors including Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Tommy Lee Jones, and Dianna Agron, some interesting characters and beautiful photography (by Thierry Arbogast), while striving to find a story to tell.Based on a book by Tonino Benacquista and co-executive-produced by Martin Scorsese, &#8220;The Family&#8221; (also known as &#8220;Malavita&#8221; meaning &#8220;Badfellas&#8221;) chronicles the life of a former mafia boss Giovanni Manzoni, now &#8220;Fred Blake,&#8221; and his wife Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and two children Belle (Dianna Agron) and Warren (John D'Leo) living in a quiet village in Normandy, France, under FBI witness protection plan. The American family has some run-ins with locals who do not know their true identity, despite the advice from FBI agent Robert Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones).&#8220;The Family&#8221; suffers from the inconsistent tone as a result of the lack of story. As a comedy it is too violent; as a gangster film it is too absurd (FBI and mafia in France?). Those violence-prone characters suddenly get weak during the shoot-out. Reference to one classic gangster movie (by Martin Scorsese) is mildly amusing, but not enough. The subplot about Belle and the math teacher goes nowhere.This is regrettable because the younger players Dianna Agron and John D'Leo are so good, almost stealing scenes from veterans. I wanted to know much more about their characters and how they dominate the school, than the clich&eacute;d culture clash episodes or tired and pointless &#8220;action.&#8221;",The Family

59263,"5 Stars = MasterpieceJohn Carpenter's 70's & 80's past, is some amazingly glorious movie making! Ambitious, visionary, outrageous, genre jumping, scary, funny, & sure as hell entertaining! Out of all his great films, nothing compares to ""The Thing!"" Even his most quoted as masterpiece, & certainly his most influential film, ""Halloween,"" can't slug it out, scene for scene, with ""The Thing.""A remake of the 1951, Howard Hawks/Christian Nyby classic, ""The Thing From Another World,"" ""The Thing"" is in all probability, the finest remake of the science fiction/horror sub-genre, & really, one of the best remakes of any genre! It is also my favorite science fiction/horror film! Here, Carpenter makes a film so intensely foreboding, that it threatens to leap out of the screen, right into your lap, & into your nightmares. The tension & dread this film conjures up, is of such a scale, that you might find your self clutching the arm rest of your easy chair, digging into the fabric, as it contents spill out. Yes, Carpenter was never better than this! Carpenter never had a better virtuosic ensemble cast than this! This film, along with ""Escape From New York,"" helped cement Kurt Russell's career from a boyhood Disney star, to a full fledged tough guy that Clint Estwood we be proud to call his own. Then there is the terrific script, taught, lean, smart, & to the point. The editing is perfect, creating a continuous atmosphere of tension filled dread! The direction, inspirational! Ennio Morricone's amazing soundtrack, pulsed to every bit of tension & dread this film has to offer, to make it all the more potently paranoid! I've always thought a soundtrack could help make or break a film. This is a textbook example of how a soundtrack is essential in feeding the meat to the monster, making it grow all the more ominous with each passing note!  But, ""The Thing,"" would not be ""The Thing,"" without Rob Bottin's  amazingly terrifying, gross, slimy, creature(s) it's self! I went to the theater when ""The Thing"" came out, & was totally mesmerized with all it's glorious, gory, ugly, special effects & make up! Truly a milestone for the time, the special effects still blow away most CGI into the next galaxy today!

The terror of not knowing when it will emerge to consume & assimilate it's next victim. Even the terror of not knowing if you yourself might be the thing. The scientific outpost's isolation from the rest of the world, cold & uninviting, make for a prison of paranoia, whose walls are collapsing on the crews ability to reason.

428020,"I was lucky enough to see this movie in a theater when it was first released.  I&#8217;ve held a certain fondness for it ever since.(It should be noted, my review is based on the product that was released in 2002, the snap case version featuring the illustration of the blue Kraken on its cover.  I decided against upgrading to the Blu-ray version based on the reviews posted here.)Out of all Ray Harryhausen films, this one has the distinction of a truly all-star cast.  Starring such incredible luminaries as Laurence Olivier, Sian Phillips, Flora Robson, Maggie Smith, Burgess Meredith, and Ursula Andress.  Alongside them are more of Harryhausen&#8217;s fantastic creations: Medusa, the Kraken, giant scorpions, the canine Dioskilos.  The story is based on myths, which gives it a good solid foundation on which to build this tale.  There&#8217;s a hero (played a bit stiffly by Harry Hamlin) and a damsel in distress and undress (Judi Bowker).  There&#8217;s also a trio of witches and no end of petulant goddesses not afraid to defy Zeus at every turn in the story.  Naturally, there&#8217;s a journey, a quest, a deadline to find a way of killing the Kraken.  It&#8217;s all very charming and exciting, it harkens back to a time when storytelling in movies was very grand with principles.  I&#8217;ve often wondered if that was the reason Ray Harryhausen prematurely retired from the industry.  His films have never really been recognized or appreciated by the movie industry until long after the fact.  It&#8217;s hard to believe your work is relevant when your peers fail to acknowledge it until decades later in an oh-by-the-way special award for services rendered.  I&#8217;ve always thought that was criminal, to my knowledge, the man was never nominated for an Oscar for any of his work.If nothing else, Ray Harryhausen can take note of the fact that millions of people do love his work.  Every movie of his that&#8217;s been released on DVD, I have and treasure.",N/A
1646734,"If you're looking for a light comedy, or if the moral integrity of characters in movies is important to you, then skip this one.However, if you're willing to sit through a somewhat depressing movie in which a large number of the characters have no integrity, then this is worth a look.I found it interesting that:- The teenage son has sex with his girlfriend in his mother's house, and she just doesn't seem to care.- The teenage boy then has his girlfriend move into his mother's house, and they continue to have sex on a regular basis, and the mother doesn't seem to care.- The girlfriend then has sex with the teenager boy's older brother.- The teenage boy's drug dealer starts dating the boy's mother.In a normal movie, these characters would be portrayed in a negative light, and the ""good people"" in the movie would come to the rescue and force the ""bad people"" to deal with the consequences of their actions. However, in this movie, these characters are actually all portrayed AS the ""good people.""Again, though, if you can ""suspend judgment"" on this oddity, it's still a well-done movie and will keep your attention.",Crazy Kind of Love

1598986,"I like the premice, a radio talk show host talking about gay culture with ""the players"" of Chicago's gay crowd. They actually used the real deal ""players"" from the community.This film actually portrayed some redeeming thoughts! It talks about the 10% of the gay population that everyone sees, and perceives as the ""stereotypical"" gay person, as well as the hidden gay population, like the guys that just go to work and don't wear their sexual orientation as a badge of honor or difference to society.It also sheds light on the ""straight"" guys who enjoy fooling around, in the gym showers or at an adult theater, maybe they're not so straight...As the film introduces each of the guests, there is an extended video montage of their works. These montages are great for the graphic nudity, sexual situations and eye candy!Stuff I didn't like about the film...This DVD turns into a preview of other Toby Ross, Hornbill, BDF films, complete with not so subliminal product placements...While I am not a video producer, and the quality is certainly better than I could do, I think you need some constructive feedback. Maybe those close to you, are too close to criticize your work.This production group needs guidance with lighting, lots of hot spots in just about every scene. This production group needs guidance with audio, too much variation with the sound, in one scene shots from one angle are loud, and from another are soft. Audio throughout fluctuates greatly from scene to scene. This production group needs guidance with editing and continuity, several very rough cuts, with inappropriate frames between. A sleeveless arm from a man (wearing a jacket) is seen in a close up as he reaches toward another character. This production group needs guidance with acting, quit reading your lines, memorize them and live them! Give the actors the freedom to become their characters and talk in a dialect that is natural for them, you don't need to read the script verbatim.Like the DVD ""Justin, A Gift from the Gods"" most of the hot, nude, sexual footage, is reused and recycled (some editing room floor footage from other films, recognizable to Toby Ross followers) from other previous productions and just spliced in to juice up the film.Overall, there is something special about Hornbill, BDF, and Toby Ross films, as long as they're still producing them, I'm still buying them!",Homosexual

1653413,"PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES is not really a good film, yet despite its problems, it is intriguing, weird and quite entertaining.Some viewers have described the picture as ""a redneck version of PULP FICTION,"" but I think that's a stretch.  Essentially, the movie consists of three unconnected stories, told separately yet all supposedly taking place at the same time, that lightly intersect along the way.  What they do have in common is that, for the most part, they all begin at a rural Louisiana pawnshop run by Vincent D'Onofrio.In one story, a trio of goofy white-supremacist drug addicts decides to rob a meth lab, but the plan goes awry when one of them (Lukas Haas) pawns their only gun in order to buy enough gas to get there.A second, much darker tale begins when a newlywed (Matt Dillon) discovers a unique ring in the pawnshop that belonged to his first wife who disappeared six years earlier, sending him on a violence-filled search to find her.The final story concerns a down on his luck Elvis Presley impersonator (Brendan Fraser), who makes a life-changing decision when he comes to a small town to play the local fair.Written by Adam Minarovich and directed by Wayne Kramer, PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES contains a number of ethereal elements that are never satisfactorily resolved.  Indeed, expanded, each of the three stories has a strong enough premise that they would probably have worked as a separate film.  Having them ""touch shoulders"" in this movie seems like a forced effort.The cast, when you can decipher their Southern dialects, is first-rate.  They include Elijah Wood, Thomas Jane, Norman Reedus, Pell James, Chi McBride and Paul Walker.PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES is available via Anchor Bay Entertainment in both a Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack and as a separate DVD.

It is not her voice that is the problem it is the pacing and the direction with dialogue over the singing, but I do believe Anna Netrebko's performance is also much better as she breathes much more life into it.

1623519,"At first I wasn't sure why so many were going to give this DVD bad reviews. Most commentaries were over the animation and dialogue.Having watched the movie now, I can see where they are coming from.From where I sit, Rise of the Technovore is a standard, mediocre anime with a Marvel character, covering and flavor to it.It's a decent enough anime style if you don't mind how white washed it will be. The lines are rather rote and forced at times. If it didn't have the Marvel name and Iron Man attached to it, this would be one of thousands of animes that's out there and is quickly forgotten because it looks like all of the rest with this technological monster going to destroy the world, tentacles sprouting from it and the hero comes in with everything at dire odds and impossible to win the day yet he does so.I can see why there are complaints of Punisher's appearance and cameo in this movie being so lack luster. And then Hawkeye and Blackwidow weren't much better off either.If you look at this as standard anime fare, this is okay, watch it once and forget it. Move on to the next anime in the pile to watch.But that this has the Marvel name and characters attached to it and the newest Marvel dvd movie out since the end of the MLG Productions and Lionsgate contract and the whole Disney now owns Marvel. People have a right to be upset. I'm glad we have a new dvd movie and that there's a promise of more Marvel Animated movies coming. But more could have been done. The animators could have done better.Take a page from DC and WB and actually take some comic lines and adapt them to animation like they have.

He seems to deliver almost endless streams of rapid-fire, grating chatter as if the audience would be thrilled to hear about his anxiety, nervousness, immaturity, fearfulness and other problems.  I think someone with a limited life experience might think he is cute and willing to share their problems linked to growing up.",N/A

A couple of months later i watched my first classic story, 'The Visitation' on Netflix. Soon i grew to like the classic show just a little better than the new.The First Doctor, William Hartnell, had many historical stories. From complete ones like 'The Reign of Terror' and 'The Gunfighters' to missing or mostly missing stories like 'Marco Polo' and 'The Crusade'. This is one of them. I watched the first episode on Netflix but then turned it off. They are talking about human sacrifices to false gods the whole time, and that's not my kind of story.I know many people like this story. But i reccommend the stories listed above.",N/A

1651825,"I'm getting tired of reviewing animated children's films and saying ""it's not Pixar"" -- and it's growing irrelevant, as Pixar's last two outings were disappointing.  Nonetheless, that run from Toy Story in '95 to Toy Story 3 in 2010 -- 15 years, 11 classic animated films with a nary a dud in the bunch -- set the bar so high it's impossible NOT to compare everything else to those films. ""Epic"" wants to be classic and grand, strives to be on a level with Pixar, but falls short.  What's interesting is where it falls short. It pretty much nails the epic scenes, the big action pieces. They are exciting and graceful, sometimes approaching breathless. And it looks great, no doubt about that. But ""Epic"" crumbles badly in the in-between scenes, the ones that make the action matter.  The subtle gestures, the ticks of personality, aren't there.  The characters feel thin, like cardboard cutouts or on loan from a stock animation company.  We have the gruff protector who struggles to express his love for anybody or anything.  The reckless but talented young buck who butts heads with him, but does the right thing when the chips are down. The Abbott and Costello sidekicks (a slug and a snail.) The wise man who doesn't know half as much as he pretends to and is kind of a slob, but once again, gets it done when everything's on the line.But the worst of the bunch is the villain.  Christoph Waltz voices the character, and that ought to be a casting jackpot - Waltz was one of the most chilling villains of recent years in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" (as well as an equally chilling good guy in last year's ""Django Unchained"") but the writers and directors of ""Epic"" have no idea what to do with him.  Frankly, I'm not sure Christoph Waltz is anything special outside of Tarantino's writing and pacing.  He excels gloriously in those slow, tortuously suspenseful, dialogue-heavy scenes that nobody but Tarantino seem to get right.Actually, I felt a bit sorry for the bad guy, whose name is Mandrake.  He's the ruler of a kingdom of rot and decay, diametrically opposed to the kingdom of life and growth ruled by Queen Tara and her Leaf Men.  Tara is voiced by Beyonc&eacute;, who, with her distinctive urban/ ghetto accent, seems like a weird choice for Queen of the Forest, but whatever.  Early in the action, Mandrake's oafish son is killed by a Leaf Man, and apparently reproduction is extremely difficult for tiny creatures of the forest, because Queen Tara has one chance in a hundred years to produce an heir, by picking a water-lily pod and making sure it blooms in the moonlight.  So Mandrake decides to steal the pod, make sure it blooms in the dark, and thus claim the progeny as his own.  So basically, the bad guy is just looking to replace his dead son. That's not so terribly evil and villainous, is it?The first half hour is annoying and laborious first dominated by clunky exposition and a terrible performance from Jason Sudeikis as the only big person who believes that Leaf Men exist.  He is clumsy and dorky and hare-brained; basically Rick Moranis from ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" minus any of the charisma and cuteness Moranis brought to that role.  But once all the exposition, and all the big people, are out of the way, ""Epic"" picks up steam and moves from painful to pleasing.  That's because the characters stop talking and start swooping around on hummingbirds and stuff.  It looks good, it moves great, but it somehow lacks that sense of enchantment that it so desperately needs to really succeed.  At one point (during the laborious first half hour) I found myself wishing they had just made little action figures, with their leaf outfits and saddled birds, and let the kids loose in the forest with them.  A couple of 7 year olds could come up with a fresher, more exciting and intriguing story than the one on the screen.I'm not sure the plot even makes sense -- the more I try to write about it, the less I find I understand. To put it briefly, Seyfried gets shrunk down to leaf man size, the queen dies, the pod gets stolen, and a motley crew of adventurers set off on an epic quest to save the forest.  Life lessons are learned, young folks fall in love, relationships are restored, and long-hidden emotions are finally expressed.There's just way too much going on here, leaving us little time to enjoy or explore the tiny world of the leaf men and their adversaries, or to feel like we know and care about the characters.  Watching it, I got the feeling that the producers and animators spent the majority of their time and resources on the action scenes, and then hurriedly wrote and drew the scenes in between them. That's not the way you tell an epic story.  That's the way you make a big, busy, beautiful but ultimately heartless and empty summer blockbuster.  To put it succintly, ""Epic"" isn't.If you're all excited about seeing an animated flick about tiny people, let me recommend a much better movie - last year's overlooked and underrated ""The Secret World of Arrietty,"" from Studio Ghibli, creators of kids' classics like ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Spirited Away."" ""Arrietty's"" not quite up to that level, but it's a much more carefully crafted tale, and captures the wonder and magic of being six inches tall in a world made for much bigger folks.[...]",N/A

671455,"Lon Chaney, an actor known for taking on the roles of characters that were tortured or grotesque and known for horror silent films such as ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""The Unknown"" and ""Laugh, Clown, Laugh"".Known as ""The Master of Makeup"", Chaney has a long list of films in his oeuvre dating back to 1912, but it wasn't until 1919 in which Chaney would receive acclaim as The Frog in ""The Miracle Man"" (unfortunately, the full version of this film is lost, only a few minute footage which is included on the Blu-ray release) but it was in 1920 in which Chaney would star in the crime drama, ""The Penalty"" and solidify his status as one of the most popular actors in America and not a one-hit wonder.The film would also captivate audiences as Chaney, playing a double leg amputee, using a leather harness to strap his two lower legs behind his thigh to two buckets.  While using crutches, he was able to take part in stunts without the use of his legs and feet.  So painful for Lon Chaney to play this role, he could only do this for short periods of time.Based on a pulp novel by Gouverneur Morris (which you can read online here), the film directed by Wallace Worsley and written by Philip Lonergan would be one of the few silent films starring Lon Chaney that many silent film fans have had watched on  home video thanks to Kino (who released the original DVD back in 2001).And in October 2012, Kino Lorber has released ""The Penalty"" on Blu-ray.  Remastered in HD from the 35 mm restoration by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department.  The film is color tinted according to the surviving instructions and features a new musical score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra in 2.0 stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio.VIDEO:""The Penalty"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and remastered in HD from the 35 mm restoration print from the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department and is color tinted according to the surviving instructions.  It's important for people to know that Kino is not a company that cleans up their films but presents the film in high definition as provided to them.  They choose films with the best print and so, you can expect prints to have some damage, tears and white specks and occasional hair or dirt that was made permanent during the restoration (at the time, many companies restored the nitrate print by converting it to 35 mm but with all defects included).Fortunately for ""The Penalty"", the film is not in bad shape at all.  There are visible splicing, color tinting was a tad bit saturated at times and  there are white specks but for the most part, I was quite pleased of watching this film in HD and seeing more detail as opposed to the 2001 DVD which had DNR but also a bit of blurring.  But the contrast is good and I saw no major issues when it comes to artifacts or any significant errors.  I'm confident that this Blu-ray release will be the definitive version of ""The Penalty"" to see for quite some time.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Penalty"" features a new musical score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra in 2.0 Stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  I'm always a fan of Rodney Sauer and the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra's work and I enjoyed their score for this Blu-ray release of ""The Penalty"".The music is fantastic and sounds amazing, crisp and clear via its lossless soundtrack. Rodney Sauer wrote on Nitrateville.com, ""Mont Alto's score for `The Penalty' -- after our previous score for `Les Vampires' -- has had us wallowing in melodrama for most of 2012. But we really like this kind of music, it gives us a great opportunity for emotional playing. This Blu-Ray is also our first recording with my newly acquired Kawai grand piano, though in most of these arrangements, the piano ends up pretty buried. When Lon plays his piano on-screen, you'll hear it a little more to the front. Grand pianos are very inspiring to play, but can be difficult to record.""SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Penalty"" come with the following special features:Chaney's Secrets Revealed - (9:33) Author Michael F. Blake gives a video tour of Chaney's actual make-up case and the costume he wore in ""The Penalty"".""By the Sun's Rays"" - (11:27) A Lon Cheney one-reel western.The Miracle Man- (2:37) The only surviving footage of Lon Chaney's breakthrough 1919 feature ""The Miracle Man"".Lon Chaney Trailers - Featuring a trailer for ""The Big City"" and ""While the City Sleeps"".EXTRAS:""The Penalty"" comes with a slipcase.JUDGMENT CALL:As I tried to put myself in the shoes of those who must have watched this film in 1920, I can certainly see how this film would be chilling to viewers.  A dark and somewhat evil character, Lon Chaney's Blizzard shows viewers the cruelty of the underworld.Viewers get to see how Blizzard is feared as he rules with an iron fist, he has show girls forcibly working under him and how his temper can easily flare to the point of hurting another woman with not so care in the world and the fact that he has this power, he gives this evil grin that surely is a predecessor of the evil grin that Jack Nicholson is known for in his chilling films such as ""The Shining"".And while people die in this film, it also is quite interesting to see how police are featured in the film.  The criminals are always a step ahead of the police, so their best chance is Rose, an agent sent to infiltrate Blizzard's operations and manages to do it.While some may see this as a positive role for a woman officer in an early silent film, unfortunately, while she is successful to infiltrate and do her own recon, she makes a key mistake which gives herself away.  To make things worse, she falls for Blizzard's charms and is torn between duty and love for him.  So, much that when he plays the organ, Rose kneels down to play the piano's pedals for him.There are quite a few scenes that are implausible and personally, there are times that I wondered that if all these women do not like to be treated so badly, what stops dozens of them from getting revenge as he is a man with no feet and on crutches.  Suffice to say, this  is one of those films one shouldn't think hard of why these people do not do things this way or that way, just think of Blizzard as this evil power that men and women fear, despite his physical disability.But what makes this film so entertaining is to see Lon Cheney giving an amazing performance.  A man who had to undergo tremendous pain just to walk on his knees and take part in many stunts, I was just amazed of how much he was able to accomplish.  But it's his performance that the film rides on his shoulders and he manages to succeed and making the film worth one's time to watch.  And the scene of Blizzard posing as satan is quite creepy.As for the Blu-ray release, for silent film fans, to have a silent Lon Cheney film on Blu-ray is fantastic, considering his breakthrough film ""The Miracle Man"" is lost.  But it's great to see the surviving footage of the film included on this Blu-ray plus one of his earlier shorts from 1914, the western ""By the Sun's Rays"" included as well.  Especially a video tour of Chaneys' actual makeup case and his costume used on ""The Penalty"".Picture quality on this Blu-ray release is much better in detail and contrast over its 2001 DVD counterpart and the new score in lossless audio by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra is well-done.Overall, Cheney's performance in ""The Penalty"" is impressive even today, over 90-years-later, how one actor can perform a role with so much pain but yet give a commanding performance is a testament to how amazing an actor he was during that era.  And it's a gangster film that probably was dark and terrifying for its time.""The Penalty"" is another welcomed addition to the George Eastman House titles on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber.  And to have a silent Lon Cheney film on Blu-ray is another win for silent film fans who have wanted to see more silent films featuring other notable talents in HD.  And one can hope that Kino Lorber continues bringing more films with other silent film stars on Blu-ray!As for this Blu-ray, ""The Penalty"" is recommended!",N/A
562455,"This is one of my all time favorite movies and I've watched it several times over the years. I'll first give some notes about the only current blu-ray version which offers English or German language options only.IMPORTANT NOTE:The only blu-ray version of this movie that currently exists is a Region B German release, so it cannot be viewed on US players.NTSC/PAL 'all region' blu-ray players are available on Amazon should US customers like to purchase one.I bought this blu-ray movie from Amazon UK because the total price is currently cheaper than buying from Amazon US.Viewers can watch the movie & bonus features in either English or German.Considering this was a 1988 made for TV movie, the audio and video quality are very good.BLU-RAY BONUS FEATURES:Some of the blu-ray extras are also found on previous DVD releases. By far, the best bonus feature on this blu-ray is the audio commentary by David Wickes with researcher Susan Davies and journalist Johnathon Sothcott. Susan Davies did 4 years of extensive research on Jack the Ripper and this movie runs along the lines of a particular theory as to who Jack might actually have been, though no one knows for certain and we will probably never know his identity.There is also a 'Deleted Scenes' extra, but this mostly looks like rehearsal material so in my opinion is not really worth watching a second time. These have Barry Forster as Inspector Abberline, before Michael Caine was finally selected to play that role.For those unfamiliar with Jack, there is a 'Documentation' extra that briefly recounts the actual events that took place in London, 1888.It really would have been nice to include actor interviews and commentary as extra features, and this will hopefully be done on future blu-ray releases.THE MOVIE:Jack the Ripper was released in 1988 to mark the first centenary of the original events. It was first aired in the US as a 2 part TV mini-series. The movie length is 189 minutes.It stars Michael Cane in the lead role as Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline of Scotland Yard and Armand Assante as American actor Richard Mansfield playing the lead in the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde premiere at the Lyceum theatre. Both of these performers were excellent, and I thought all of the players were quite good except for Michael Gothard who over-played the role of Lusk, maybe because that script could have been better and more accurately written to protray the actual Mr. Lusk rather than this hyped up movie version.The story recounts the murder of 5 prostitutes and the hunt for Jack the Ripper. It is not always factually accurate and does employ 'dramatic license' several times to appeal to audiences, but it is a great movie nonetheless. Director/Producer David Wickes and his crew did an excellent job on this film. The cinematography, realistic Victorian settings and costumes are excellent.In 1989, Michael Caine won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV, and Armand Assante was Nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV. The movie was also Nominated for Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV.Release Date: 21 October 1988 (USA)DIRECTED BY DAVID WICKESWRITING CREDITS: DEREK MARLOWE & DAVID WICKESPRODUCER: DAVID WICKESORIGINAL MUSIC BY JOHN CAMERONCAST:MICHAEL CAINE - CHIEF INSP.

1621105,"Overall if you've seen the series A Certain Magical Index then you know the character of Misaka Mikoto somewhat, a young highschool tomboyish girl with quite a temper and the electric power to back it up.  The series is pretty much of the previous mentioned series but this one focuses more on the character of Misaka and her friends who also live in Academy City. The first Kuroko Shirai who not only being a teleporter but also a member of Judgement the Academies school enforced semi-police force for the city then you have another member of Judgement as well as the third friend of the four Kazari Uiharu who while not having any powerful Esper abilities still has a keen mind and advanced expertise in computers closing the group is Ruiko Saten who is Kazari's best friend and like her has a keen mind though more interested in the latest urban legends and gossip more then anything else also Ruiko is what is called a level 0 someone who shows no discernible esper abilities during her test which leaves her somewhat disappointed.The series follows the friends during their adventures throughout the show both comedic and dramatic though the series tries to keep the drama more to a medium level so it doesn't reach the darker aspects like Death Note or Shiki.  The characters are pretty endearing for the most part but there are times where Misaka's personality comes off as a little condescending especially on the difference between power levels between espers as does Kuroko's sometimes which makes them less likable at points in the series.  The animation and soundtrack are done very well and of course the subbed and dubbed are terrific too. So if you liked A Certain Magical Index or like tough female characters then the series is a nice one to add to your anime collection just remember while the series is entertaining the overall plot is pretty generic so don't expect any originality in the main storyline....",N/A

882303,"This documentary is more about individuals who suffer from a variety of social and personal issues, than it is a movie about scrabble. Scrabble is simply the tool that these people use to focus their obsessions on. The cast of characters in this documentary is really diverse not only in race but in backgrounds and personalities. Some of the players are people who you would never think to be world class scrabble players. I am not a big scrabble player but I know that it takes a certain high level of intellect to master and the people being following in this movie go to great lengths to master the game. They even sacrifice having a happy and normal life in order to pursue this game. However, the people in this movie seem to be in need of help. That sounds judgmental but I believe it to be true.

You get a good look at these peoples lives both in the world pf scrabble and out.All in all, this is an interesting movie of a small subculture that most people dont know about.

882106,"I found this series by chance and fell in love very quickly with the whole show---the wonderful locale and the great characters.  Each one was funny and warm and very likable, with the exception of Justine, Archie's old girlfriend, who quickly went back to London.  It made me happy just to watch these really nice people in their beautiful countryside, working away at the struggles of their lives always helping one another out and coming out on top.My love affair carried through Season II and into most of Season III.  About three quarters of the way through I found myself rooting for the people the show was obviously trying to make into the bad guys.  I got a little tired of the gollie (sp?) in his two-day stubble, uttering words of wisdom but I could deal with that.  Then, the very interesting and not unattractive bank officer. Stella, showed a softer side that endeared her to me.  I started pulling for her to win the heart of Archie although I knew she didn't have a chance with the writers.  Then...when one of the most adorable, colorful, clever characters was eliminated, I lost heart.If only they had kept Hector and booted Lexie it would have been a perfect season and I'd look forward to the next one.

256101,"The follow-up to Citizen Kane is revered both for what it is -- a broody slab of American Gothic -- and what it isn't -- 50 minutes longer.Yes, the studio re-edited the film without the input of Welles, chopping it down to 88 minutes and filming a newer, happier ending. Legend has it that the lost footage was quickly destroyed by RKO Pictures to prevent Welles from editing it back in.While Welles was already notorious for going over budget, the fault really lay with RKO. They knew that The Magnificent Ambersons, a Booth Tarkington novel Welles and his Mercury Theatre had previously adapted for radio, was a tragic downer when they greenlighted it with an unheard-of-for-RKO million-dollar budget. But Welles would get the blame, and never really have full control over a decently budgeted studio film again.What's left here is a magnificent, truncated Gothic tale with more than a hint of Great Expectations about it, though it's Great Expectations as seen in a funhouse mirror. Welles' brilliant use of shadows and textures, and his uncommonly fine understanding of how to achieve depth of field with the camera technology of the early 1940's, is on display here. The movie looks great as the camera flows through the chiarascuro rooms of the Amberson mansion.The other fascinating intertext for this film would be The Great Gatsby, again in a funhouse mirror as the pseudo-Gatsby character, played by Joseph Cotten, becomes a true (and benevolent) success while the old-money family of the woman who rejected his love in a fit of pique, played by Dolores Costello, disintegrates under the onslaught of Time and the 20th Century. Tim Holt is suitably un-formed and callow as the spoiled rich kid, and Anne Baxter is radiant as Cotten's daughter Lucy.",The Magnificent Ambersons Colorized Version  VHS

1562724,"Monster&#8217;s University is a good film and a fun time at the movies, especially for children.  However, at the same time, I cannot say that this is one of Pixar&#8217;s strongest films either.  The same can be said for Monster&#8217;s Inc.  I saw Monster&#8217;s Inc. years ago and remember liking it okay, but not being blown away by it either.  I thought it was mediocre.  I think that Monsters&#8217; Inc.  is one of my least favorite Pixar films.  The same can be said for this film.  On its own it is a pretty good film and got some laughs out of me, but compared to many of Pixar&#8217;s past works like, The Incredibles, Wall-E, Finding Nemo,  and the Toy Story films, this one seemed a tad underwhelming.  Those films that I mentioned appealed to both children and adults, while this film gears more towards kids.One of the film&#8217;s problems is that it is very formulaic.  Until the last half hour the story was very clich&eacute; and I knew pretty much how it would play out.  You have the main character, Mike (Billy Crystal), who as a dream to be the scariest monster.  However, he starts out the underdog, is ridiculed by his peers, and has to work his way to the top.  I have seen that many times before.  You also have the extremely cocky best friend, Sullivan (John Goodman), who is very full of himself and has to learn to be more humble.  You also have the other gang of misfits that are there for comic relief and periodically help out.  You also have the rival gang of bullies that the heroes must defeat.  The first hour felt very clich&eacute; to me.However, the last half hour I did not see coming actually.  The part where Mike and Sullivan are trapped in the human world is definitely my favorite part of the movie.  I also like how Mike and Sullivan finally resolve their differences and help each other.  At first I was going to give this film three stars.  However, the ending made me bump up the rating a bit.Overall, Monsters&#8217; University is a fun time at the movies.  Children should love it.

1327578,"Let me preface this by saying that this film is definitely not appropriate for younger viewers.  It is an unending, unremitting, endless series of bloody exchanges of gunfire between thugs and police, thugs and other thugs, a massive, bloody shooting rampage with bodies flying everywhere on a scale not remotely equaled by anything Hollywood has ever produced.  It even contains a woman and child being wounded in crossfires.  And the violence seems more shockingly realistic than most gun violence in Hollywood films, which makes it even more horrifying.  You can almost feel the bullets penetrate your psyche.  It is ten thousand times bloodier and more violent than even the most violent scenes of a movie like, say, ""The Wild Bunch.""  There is a sort of corny code of honor between a cop and an assassin that develops, but all of this is mere pretext to carry on with the violent show. If you are faint of heart or abhor violence, you'll want to stay far away from this.  Yes, definitely not for the faint of heart.",N/A

So I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to.It's quirky and sort of dark, which I like, and it has a consistent tone of unreality all the way through, which I also like. I'd gotten the idea that the Wilson brothers (Owen, et al) are closely bound up with Anderson, so I was relieved not to see any of them here because I can't stand any of them.But I didn't mind some actors whom I usually can't stand (Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray), I liked one I always like (Frances McDormand), and I was indifferent to the rest, to whom I'm generally indifferent (Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, etc). The kids were okay but nothing exceptional.I don't see what in this movie freaked out the people who were freaked out by it, unless it was the sex play between the kids; but heterosexual sex always disgusts me so this was no different. Overall, a movie I enjoyed more than I expected to but probably won't ever watch again.",N/A
489130,"In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera ""Farewell My Concubine"" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations.The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.'With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text.Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics.One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery.Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas).This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.",N/A
1538883,"Jonathan Flynn(Robert DeNiro) announces himself to audience as a writer on the level of Mark Twain.  Conveniently he omits to mention that he did a stretch for passing bad checks, abandoned his family, and is an unrepentant bigot.  Nicholas Flynn(Paul Dano) is an aspiring poet who engages in casual affairs, drinks, and takes recreational drugs to ease the pain of his father leaving and his mother's suicide.  Nicholas takes a job at the local men's shelter so he wouldn't hate himself so much and to help the downtrodden.  One night Jonathan comes into the shelter looking for a bed for the night.  The lives of these two disconnected men will change in ways that are unimaginable.  DeNiro's turn here is note perfect despite being buoyant.  In lesser hands you could say it was over-the-top but DeNiro plays it to perfection.  Dano's more subdued turn is appropriate for his character who is quietly simmering inside and it compliments DeNiro's largesse.  Good supporting work is offered by Julianne Moore seen in flashback as Nicholas' mother and Wes Studi as the shelter supervisor.  This film brought to mind a film DeNiro did years ago called ""This Boy's Life"" with Leonardo DiCaprio that explored a toxic father-surrogate son relationship.  If the characters DeNiro played in both films weren't so pathetic you would absolutely despise them.",Being Flynn

509838,"Saving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war. The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported. The contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general: that the values of freedom, family and human rights are ideals worth dying for: even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors. The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect. The question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued, why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb? The answer: these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother, and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations. This seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the death.Great film told with what I count to be three major external plots: to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men. The lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two. Thus proving the Controlling Idea that brotherhood is worth dying for.My major complaint is the film is too long. Three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place. The brothers are ""good"" from beginning to end and their relationships are ""good"" from beginning to end. Of course there are minor plotlines like Opum's compassion for POWs and Reiben's questioning of Miller's judgement. But they don't create serious turning points in an otherwise external-action focused story. I think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle: the Carparso dying to save a French child, the radar assault that loses Wade and the church resting.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",Saving Private Ryan VHS

I have the cds from La Scala, and this is better, only beacuse she is older and wiser and better at bel canto's demands, fioriture, legato lines etc.Her subsequent performances were loudly applauded...La Scala has sufferd for this disgrace..no one will sing there of any note. Lool at the DVDs for La Scala..Devia, Antonacci, Dessai..very good, but not Renee Fleming.She can sometimes over extend, especilly in a glottal lower register that is best left alone. Otherwise, she knows all about her strengths and they are all here for the discerning opera lover to see and hear. Her &#34;Come bello&#34; reminds me of Callas but then it is Renee's own as she delves into its depths with seriousness and a kind of early madness.Dull, camp opera? By no means! There are numerous magnificent moments of singing and drama as well. The libretto is very lenient toward  Lucrezia's sins, but we do get that early plot favorite, wife-accused-of adultry archetypal center to the story. The ending is fabulous, the duets are harsh, cold, as they should be. Lucrezia and her husband are killers. but Lucrezia herself.... we feel for her through her oft poisoned son, and the final &#34;Era desso il figlio mio..&#34; stands out as one of the finest moments in Fleming's career as a singer.

This DVD contains three different videos - the saltwater reef, a goldfish aquarium, and a mountain stream.  All of them are colorful and relaxing, and look very real.  It will play on either a DVD player or a computer monitor.I was familiar with this type of DVD because our pediatrician has the goldfish aquarium one in his waiting room.  I see small children riveted by the fish, squealing and trying to catch them, every time we visit.I think the reef video should have been slowed down just a tiny bit - the plants waving look faster than I've ever seen ocean plants waving.  But the starfish, snail and many different fish are fun to watch.The goldfish aquarium is all the color and fun without the mess and maintenance of actual goldfish.  The bubbling sounds in the background are calming and sound like an actual aquarium.  If you have a wall-mounted flat screen TV, people will think you have a built-in aquarium.The mountain stream is wonderful for background white noise.

It might have been even funnier if some of this wasn't true.  Set in Miami, three knuckleheads, stereotypical muscle-bound gym rats all, decide that to advance in the material world, they should kidnap a wealthy owner of a sandwich franchise.Victor (Tony Shalhoub) is a naturalized citizen coming from South America and likely has underworld connections.  In any case he keeps most of his money offshore.  He is a very unlikeable character, always demeaning others.  Daniel (Mark Wahlberg) is the ""brains"" of the trio looking to get Victor's dough.  He's actually sociable and manages to increase the membership of a health club owned by John (Rob Corddry).  But that isn't enough.  He's worked hard but is still short of his goal.  He wants more money.  When Victor becomes a client, kidnapping and ransom seems like the right course of action.  Helping him is his testosterone-addled best friend Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul, a loveable ex-con played with a soft emotional side by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.Things become complicated, but after a long series of torture methods, Victor gives Daniel the codes needed to get the money.  He basically signs away all his property and Daniel just moves into Victor's house.  When Victor recognizes Daniel's voice, the hapless trio decide they must kill Victor.  They try.  Several times.  Victor somehow manages to survive each time.  Ed Harris is along for the ride as a retired detective, hired by Victor to get the goods on Daniel and his cohorts.I found the film reasonably entertaining, finding the himbos fun to watch.  The film does have an amped up tone of violence, especially against Shalhoub's character.  He's such an unlikeable character however, we are almost happy to see it.  And Miami must have the only police department that shoots at unarmed, running suspects.The Blu ray disc is a winner.  It comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The various colors of Miami really pop in this film.  Awash in pastels and bright whites, the film really sparkles.  Both exterior and some dark, dirty, bloody interiors work well on screen.  Excellent detail shows sweat, beards and splattered blood with great clarity.  The disc comes with an exhilarating Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless track.  The subs are in action, particularly when the scene shifts to a strip club.  The kind that advertises ""totally nude"" but none of the performers are even partially nude.  I digress.  The overall audio offers excellent clarity throughout the film.  The softer ambient sounds are as good as the immersive gun battles.  Subtitles come in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  There are no extras.",N/A

1608384,"This review contains spoilers. However, if you are at all interested in this movie then you may be thankful to have read them.I'm a horror nut, like quite a few SyFy originals, and adore the killer plant theme. Unfortunately, this is not ""one for eco-horror fans!"" This is more of a religious/political semi-thriller than anything else. The movie started out great, then it's as if the budget for digital effects ran out. It soon turns into a religious talky bore without the destruction. I was enjoying the movie until the tendrils came to Reno. They approach the city then instead of seeing any destruction the audience is shown a satellite image and the government officials say Reno is being devastated. The tease was like a punch in the gut. I then figured maybe the scenes of destruction would be saved for the climax. Nope. The tendrils reach Sacramento, the image shakes a bit while people run, then that's it.The movie was shot well. The acting wasn't bad. The special effects were typical of a SyFy original. The beginning had plenty of action. All the pieces were in place for a good (for a SyFy original) movie. That is why it turned out to be such a monumental disappointment. How something like this could end up as a great looking blu-ray (the image is nice and vibrant hovering around 25-30 Mbps) while Arachnoquake and Piranhaconda remain MIA in the US is a crime against horror fans.Note: if you pick this up and think you can just sell it on Amazon if you don't like it, think again. Amazon has classified this as a restricted item. This is probably because they know the $20+ price they're asking is insane and no one would bite if sellers offered it for less.",Seeds of Destruction

1329821,"I came at this film knowing nothing about it except what I read on the back jacket and that it included the incredible actress Amanda Seyfried (pronounced Zi- freed). Man, what a ride. Seyfried plays a quirky prostitute that really aims to please.  That pleasing is focused on the seemingly dejected wife of Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore. Rarely do you see a film that can capture eroticism with such accuracy. The film is art in motion. The trio of Seyfried, Mooore and Neeson portray real people with believable emotions and desires that raise raw sexuality to true everyday existence. The couples teenage son also adds a fresh approach to intimate encounters.The term ""erotic thriller""  really hits the mark as Seyfried walks a tightrope that envelopes you with thrills and chills. Her body is made for the cinema. Liam Neeson does not typically play the confused husband role but handles in deftly while Moore reveals the amazing range of her acting abilities. Not to be missed on a cozy night home with a lady friend.",Chloe
1586776,"""The Sweeney"" is an update of a British police drama that aired on television from 1975-78.  I, myself, have never seen this TV show, but I have heard that some of its fans were not too pleased with this adaptation.  Without having any pre-set expectations, though, I found this a relatively successful actioner that keeps up a frantic pace and features a great cast.  At times, it is riddled with illogical moments and inconsistencies.  But overall, I was swept along with the plot.  One important note, though, Ray Winstone and Ben Drew (the two leads) allow their brogue to overwhelm their dialogue for much of the movie.  I turned on the subtitles about 5 minutes into the movie and it helped considerably.  ""The Sweeney"" isn't necessarily a great movie, but it is an effective one.The Sweeney refers to an elite police squad known for getting results at any cost.  Winstone is their leader, the subject of an internal affairs investigation.  I especially loved that the squad is accused of brutality and unnecessary force as they oftentimes bring baseball bats to a gun fight!  After a spiffy introduction, with the team taking down an armed robbery, the main case is revealed.  A jewelry store robbery results in the senseless murder of a young woman.  Winstone has seen the pattern before and targets a criminal from his past.  But as further crimes unfold, is he letting his tunnel vision get the better of him?  When things turn more personal and tragic, however, all bets are off.  Winstone and his protege (Drew) will have to work outside the law to settle the score.The film is filled with plenty of fights, shoot-outs, and gun battles.  You can't always get caught up in what makes sense, though.  One foot chase, in particular, would have endangered hundreds of civilians as semi-automatic weapons blaze through the city streets.  In another, a trailer park is brutalized but no one pops out to see what is happening.  But still, these sequences are exceedingly well executed.  If you can turn your brain off a bit, you can have some fun with the gritty unpleasantness of it all.  Winstone is an imposing figure and Drew acquits himself well. Other names in the cast include Hayley Atwell and Damien Lewis.  Atwell, who is lovely, has to (of course) convince you that she wants to have sex with Winstone and so I'll give her special note for that.  ""The Sweeney,"" in the end, is what it is.  It doesn't have lofty goals, it just seeks to entertain.  And I liked it.  Its relentless pace help you overlook some of its plotting flaws.  KGHarris, 3/13.",The Sweeney

751483,"Growing up, Sailor Moon was always one of my favorites.  Even though it was for girls, it was the best girls' cartoon ever.  I tried it because I really liked how it looked visually, & it did not disappoint.  I loved watching it on USA & later Toonami.  Then my parents got rid of cable, & I forgot about it but I had over a dozen episodes taped, & they survived to remind me of it.  Some of the episodes became a little cheesy with age but the good ones were still really good.  But then I heard about the butchering DIC had done to it, & tried the Japanese version, & it's superior for the first 2 seasons; I honestly prefer watching the movies in English & the third season I like watching in Japanese or English depending on the episode, but that's another story to be told another time.  We're here to discuss the first season.  I will review each of the seasons & the movies, & with each season I will compare it to the manga and talk about which one I like better & why.Season 1 is where the story begins, with a girl named Usagi, who gets a visit from a talking cat who tells her she is really the super heroine Sailor Moon.  She then fights the Dark Kingdom lead by Queen Beryl & her right-hand man, Jedite, while being helped by the mysterious Tuxedo Mask.  Yeah, that's probably the most bizarre name for a superhero but who cares?  He's my favorite character in the whole show.  The first disc is honestly the worst disc in the set.  It's still good, it's just that it can feel repetitive at times.  Things do pick up when Sailor Mercury appears.  And then only two episodes after that we meet my favorite Martian (apart from the Martian Manhunter) Sailor Mars.  The duo becomes a trio, & the episodes become less formulaic & more entertaining.  Then the unthinkable happens; Jedite dies!  Okay, Queen Beryl puts him to sleep forever but still I wasn't expecting that.  We then get a new general, Nephrite.  He is much more interesting than Jedite ever was, namely how another general named Zoiscite loves to taunt him, & especially when he gets romantically involved with Usagi's best friend Naru.  This leads to a heartbreaking final episode where he turns good & rescues Naru from Zoiscite... then gets skewered by a cluster of giant thorns from one of Zoi's Youma.  As a kid this was very shocking to see.  Aside from being fairly graphic, it was really sad seeing him die.  This was when I realized Sailor Moon was no ordinary cartoon.  This episode (#24) is so good, even the dubbed version still packs a punch (and no, they didn't edit out the green blood; kudos to you DIC).  Then we meet my favorite of the girls, Sailor Jupiter as Zoiscite & his boyfriend Kunzite (yeah) go hunting for the 7 rainbow crystals that when combined will create the Silver Crystal.  Then after all the crystals are found we meet the last of the Sailors (for this season) Sailor Venus, AKA Sailor V, Usagi's heroine (NOTE: the author of the original manga wrote Sailor V first, but then switched over to writing Sailor Moon for reasons I don't know) and her talking cat Artemis, who despite the name is male.  Then there is a clash between our heroes and the Dark Kingdom for the crystals, & a bittersweet result.  The Sailors get the crystals & form the Silver Crystal & Queen Beryl kills Zoiscite, but Tuxedo Mask is captured after being badly wounded.  It turns out he's okay; Queen Beryl just brainwashed him into being her slave!  One of the most gut wrenching moments in the series for me was when he first hit Sailor Moon with a black rose.  This of course leads to a 3-part finale that remains the high point of this season.  I cried all throughout the last 2.  I actually cry a fair bit while watching the best of this show.  That's the beauty of this show; it's so varied.  Some episodes are hilarious, some episodes are just fun, some are exciting, some are romantic & some are just heartbreaking.  And I love all the characters.Okay, so how does this compare to the manga?  Although the anime beats it by significantly more than a nose here, I can see why some people preferred the manga.  It was more condensed with no filler so it was more to the point, & I have to admit the 4 generals had a more interesting backstory than in the anime.  It was also even darker than the series, apart from the ending.  I have to admit, I thought the ending of the anime was better, as when the manga ends it's ready to lead right into the next arc but when the anime ends you're not sure if there is any more to see after it.  So, I'll just go with the anime, because of that & I like some of the characters (especially Sailor Mars) better in the anime.So overall Sailor Moon is rightfully hailed as a classic.  & it's only going to get better; for the next 2 seasons at least.  Tune in next time, when we review my personal favorite season Sailor Moon R.","Sailor Moon, Season One, Complete and Uncut"
1536653,"First, I thought this movie was funny and had some entertaining elements. Second, it's hard to find a movie that any of the four main actors are in, that I don't enjoy. However, (in my opinion), I was a little disappointed because it didn't turn out to be more of the movie I thought it was sold as via the trailers. When I first saw the trailer, I was pretty amped and couldn't wait to see it, but for whatever reason, I never got a chance to see it in the theater. So, this is the type of movie I&#8217;m glad that I ended up renting it instead. Like I said, the movie was entertaining and there were some very good parts, but a little lack-luster. With a title like 7 Psychopaths, you think there&#8217;d be a little more to the story/plot that pushed the envelope&#8230;but unfortunately, there wasn&#8217;t.

It reminded me a lot of what we know today as a television soap opera.  I like Greenstreet and Lorre very much.  They seem relaxed and comfortable in the movie.  There was entirely too much cigarette smoking for my taste.  The movie is interesting to me mainly because it is a time capsule of a simpler better art deco era,  when there were no computers and televisions, and darn few radios, and landline telephones were the height of modernity and innovation.  Railroad train travel was the height of fashion and convenience.  I could watch B & W movies like this one all day, except I would need kegs of popcorn and I can't take the calories any more.***A better movie where Greenstreet and Lorre have bigger and much more elegant parts is ""The Verdict"" with a linear and well dramatized plot ... still noir but much better directed***",The Mask of Dimitrios VHS

Unlike turkeys like &#34;Top Gun&#34;, which was idiotic from start to finish, The Final Countdown looks and feels right.

284441,"The Letter boasts about as enthralling a beginning as one might hope for: After atmospheric shots of a Southeast Asian rubber plantation at night, a shot is heard. A man staggers onto the front steps of the main house, where a woman shoots him repeated until he is dead. A full moon slips in and out of clouds, and the woman with the gun in her hand is Bette Davis. It's a wow start, and in the first few ensuing minutes one anticipates a film in which secrets will peel back one by one, revealing dark truths. Sadly, after the first quarter hour, this picture simply falls flat despite some very nice acting and photography. The presence of an incriminating letter briefly heightens the tension, but matters proceed in a rather pedestrian fashion before Bette precipitates her date with destiny. Davis does shine in her role, as does Herbert Marshall as the devoted husband and James Stephenson as the attorney friend -- both Davis and Stephenson earned Oscar nominations for their efforts. Still, this film, based on a Somerset Maugham play, has little in the way of twists and turns except at the very start and the very end. For me, aside from the acting, it's a yawner.",N/A

1325225,"I can sum up what's wrong with this work very easily: it's the kind of film where characters do, say, and feel things because the script says they do. The most egregious example of this is the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane Foster. It's just sort of plopped in our laps that these two characters who've only just met are now madly in love.Are they? Well gee. How about that, huh?There are also problems with the visual design of the film. I'm particularly thinking here of the sets and costuming. To be fair, they started out with the right idea, taking their cues directly from Jack Kirby's original work on the Marvel comic book version of Thor. But while the idea may have been great, the execution was profoundly uninspired. Just as any mediocre art student can ""copy"" van Gogh's style up to a point, these people have copied Kirby... up to a point. But that spark of something exceptional that allowed Kirby to truly add to the visual language of our culture - it's just not there. The electrifying energy and well-nigh cosmic sense of portent that were such hallmarks of Kirby's work are nowhere to be found. In this film Loki's helm looks like exactly what it is: a chunk of plastic.In the end, I'd have to say that what's really wrong with the film is the same thing that's wrong with most superhero films: even though they hired a bunch of A-listers to pull it off, having been hired these people did not apparently see any real need to take what they were doing especially seriously. It's not that they produced a campy farce. It's more that they very obviously didn't feel the need to bring their own A-games to bear. After all, it's only a superhero movie. A summer blockbuster. `Nuff said.To be fair, for the most part the fault lies not so much with the actors as with the writers and director (although in exception to this, I'm not entirely sure that Anthony Hopkins was even awake for much of the filming). But getting back to those behind the camera, it's quite plain for all to see that these people just didn't care that much about what they were doing.As a result, just...Meh.Theo.",N/A

1623972,"I wasn't too keen on seeing this over-hyped matchup between Russell Crowe as a crooked mayor and Mark Wahlberg as former cop.  Billy Taggart, a struggling private investigator now works for Mayor Hostetler.  Surprisingly the movie isn't too bad.  Sure, the testosterone overflows, but Crowe and Wahlberg have both been much worse.  One thing I could have done without is Wahlberg's scenes as a drunk.  Not convincing.Taggart was kicked off the force for shooting and killing a rapist/murderer who was turned loose by the courts.  The victim's sister Natalie (Natalie Martinez) becomes Billy's girlfriend but inexplicably departs midway through the movie.  It's like the filmmaker's just decided to change plots.  Taggart is hired by the mayor to follow his wife, Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is suspected of having an affair.  Alas, there is more to her activities than sex.She has the goods on her hubby and would love nothing better than for him to be defeated in the soon to be held election.  The twists and turns are sharp and frequent but easy enough to keep up with.  Easy enough that you can pretty much see them coming.  Still, my low expectations were exceeded.  While there's not much new here, the film is an entertaining enough take on modern film noir.",N/A

1555532,"I fell in love with Neill Blomkamp's first film ""District 9""; the South African filmmaker's take on a sci-fi film was really brilliant and shows how a filmmaker with a unique storytelling voice can create something new and exciting. It was an eye-opening experience and even more remarkable because it was the filmmaker's first full-length feature.His second film ""Elysium"" is not quite as ground-breaking or original, but it does add a unique voice, making it a more interesting sci-fi film. In a less talented director's hands, ""Elysium"" would be a routine sci-fi programmer, the type of film quickly forgotten and relegated to endless cable runs. But Blomkamp's vision and style help ensure that ""Elysium"" will be remembered as a highlight of the summer.Los Angeles in 2154 is an overpopulated, toxicly polluted, dry and brown landscape in which people toil at meaningless jobs and struggle to survive. Yes, I said 2154 and not 2013. The working class is essentially stuck on Earth in what is a police state. The rich and wealthy live on a space station that looks like Beverly Hills and comes complete with machines able to heal any sickness or ailment. The people on Earth make attempts to board Elysium, to take advantage of the healing machines, but Delacourt (Jodie Foster), the head of Defense, quickly orders these errant spaceships shot down. Back on Earth, Max (Matt Damon) gets involved in an accident at work and becomes irradiated. He soon learns he has five days to live. Struggling to figure out how to survive, he meets mercenaries who offer to help him; they will strap a metal framework to his body and use intelligence stolen from Carlyle (William Fichtner) to get past Elysium's security network. As Max struggles with these preparations (the framework is physically attached to his body), he reconnects with Frey (Alice Braga), a girl he grew up with in an orphanage. She now has a daughter who is sick and about to die, giving Max even more reason to get to Elysium. But Delacourt also has a rogue warrior, Kruger (Sharlito Copley), in her pocket and enlists him to stop Max and help her restore order.Written and directed by Blomkamp, the narrative of ""Elysium"" is presented in an economical way, which keeps the story moving and holds your interest. There is a very brief intro before we watch an unauthorized shuttle approach the space station. We watch Delacourt go into action and then focus on Max back on Earth. Max labors through every day, much like the other people living in Los Angeles, but he does what he has to do and tries to remain positive about everything. We quickly learn about his living situation, his job, what life is like in this Los Angeles. It isn't great. A lot of sci-fi films run over two hours and this is usually attributed to the set-up and backstory necessary to get us involved in the story. Blomkamp doesn't stop the narrative to give us details, he gives us the details as part of the narrative. It is so much more engaging to learn these things as the story unfolds - because so much is happening, we pay closer attention and enjoy the finer points of this filmmaker's work.Max lives in a little shack in the middle of an even more run-down part of town. This is the part of town run by Spider (Wagner Moura), the man behind constant attempts to get sick people up to Elysium for treatment. He finally comes up with a plan and Max is the key. But Max is a reluctant hero and takes some convincing. When he decides to help Spider out, the process proves to be painful, continuously forcing Max to prove his determination to help. Watching Max's journey also propels us further into his universe and life.There are a lot of things going on in ""Elysium"". Spider wants to get sick people to the space station, to receive treatment. This is a driving force in his life. But he also wants to get people up there - any people - to help break the exclusivity of this place, to smash the class barrier. He uses one obsession as a mask for another.Matt Damon's Max is an interesting reluctant hero. Max seems happy to be just surviving. In fact, after he has an accident and work and receives a dire prognosis, his desire to continue living drives him to take the next steps to help Spider and become part of his team. Throughout the journey we share with Max, we learn about him and his view of life, we see a few moments he shared with Frey when they were kids, moments that foreshadow who they will both become. It is a surprisingly complex character and Damon brings a lot to the role.Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, the head of security for Elysium. She is a steely woman who doesn't seem to think twice about ordering a shuttle of Earth refugees shot down before it reaches Elysium. Her focus is to keep the people of Elysium safe and her focus never wavers. Even when the President questions her and threatens to reprimand her, she seems to consider these to be minor inconveniences and continues forward with her duties, never missing a step. In fact, the threat of a reprimand only serves to make her take the next step in her plan.Sharlito Copley plays Kruger, a mercenary under the thumb of Delacourt, willing and able to do whatever it takes to fulfill his responsibilities. Copley, the star of ""District 9"", adds a unique character to the film. As soon as Kruger sees the power shifting, he takes advantage of the situation to the best of his ability. And this allows Copley to really allow Kruger to become larger than life. He is almost a human version of the Terminator, pursuing his goals with an unhuman tenacity.The fact that the name of the space station Elysium - where all of the rich and privileged live, and where they have no worries, no sickness - is borrowed from Greek mythology adds another level of interest to the film and shows the creativity of Blomkamp. It goes back to that 'unique storyteller' thing I was talking about earlier. Let's face it, many won't get the reference - many writers and directors probably wouldn't - so when a filmmaker does, you sit up and take notice. Everyone wanted to go to the Elysium Fields, paradise, like heaven, to be with family and friends, to never get sick again. The Elysium in this film is remarkably similar to Beverly Hills - large estates, predominately white marble, lots of green spaces. The only difference is the slight curve to the landscape to reflect the curve in the space station.Once Max and Kruger arrive at Elysium, the film falters a bit and becomes more conventional. They battle each other, fighting to the death. It is a well-orchestrated fight, but it doesn't offer a lot of new visual material for us to savor, material that Blomkamp has already earned a reputation for.The entire final act falters slightly, veering very close to a routine sci-fi conclusion. This is disappointing because everything up to that point is really good, memorable and interesting.Blomkamp is a skilled craftsman, capable of creating a unique moviegoing experience. I hope he continues to use his skill, his voice, to create many, many more films to come.",N/A

66795,"Like their previous Blu-ray upgrades of ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and ""Psycho"", Universal finally gives ""Saboteur"" it's due with a near pristine picture for it's Blu-ray debut. I've owned every format of this Hitchcock film(VHS,DVD) and was stunned by the picture and sound. ""Saboteur"" has never looked better on Blu-ray and the restoration team at Universal deserves the highest praise for making this film finally look the way it should. Filmed in black and white, there is no print damage(vertical lines, dirt, white specs, etc.) compared to previous video versions with blacks, whites, and grays looking clear and sharp. You can make out the smallest details and the overall picture quality is well balanced throughout. The story is a familiar one for Hitchcock that he returned to time and again-that of a man wrongly accused of a crime and the things he does to clear his name. The storyline might not be familiar to those not well-versed in World War II espionage on the home-front, but it does contain the famous Statue of Liberty scene that is the climax of the film. As for the Audio, it's been cleaned up too and there is no more static or hiss that plagued previous versions. Credit once again should be given to the expert restoration team at Universal for their superb work. Besides the above mentioned Hitchcock titles that have been restored on Blu-ray, the team at Universal has recently given new life to such black and white classics as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""Cape Fear""(both from 1962) for new audiences to discover and enjoy. ""Saboteur"" is 109 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.33) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, and French. Audio includes: English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Mono and English Dolby Digital 2.0. Special features include ""Saboteur: A Closer Look"" which is carried over from the standard DVD. ""Saboteur"" has never gotten the respect it should from critics but hopefully this superb new Blu-ray presentation from Universal will get a second look from not only Hitchcock experts but fans as well. Watching it, you'll be rooting for Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane just like audiences did in 1942. I sure did.",N/A

1426859,"""The Black Sleep"" (1956) may not rank among the greatest horror movies of all time, but it's a well crafted film, with an outstanding cast.

29194,"*****SPOILERS*****a nightmare on elm street is my favorite horror movie, and amongst my all-time favorite movies (number three, to be precise). from the moment i first saw it, at the tender age of 14, i was captivated, less so because of the iconic presence of mr. kreuger, but more so due to it's beautiful, dark imagery, and, of course, the presence of the earth shattering heather langenkamp. additionally, it is another movie wherein wes explores themes of family, and how traditional families in the twentieth century fail to uphold one another.anoes is an excellent example of low-budget, high creativity filmmaking. working with about one and a half million dollars, craven was wise to employ master mechanical effects man jim doyle (who also doubled as freddy's hand in the bathtub), who was able to create incredible effects by repurposing the rotating room he built, once for tina's death and agin for glen's. but nifty touches--freddy's long arms sparking along the walls, freddy jumping out from behind a skinny, gnarled tree, freddy phasing through rod's cell bars--make anoes something truly special, and it is loaded with visuals that far exceed it's limited budget. david miller's make-up is, to me, the highpoint of the series; freddy never looked so evil and dirty. jacque haitkin's camera assists this effect mightily, as freddy is generally shot lurking in the shadows.the performances in anoes also elevate it beyond its' meager budget. robert englund is the quintessential boogyman, creepy, guttural, sleight. he ambles and shuffles, and is delightfully gleeful in his sadistic evil. john saxon, b-movie icon, is perfect as the impatient, out-of-his league father donald, and ronee blakely is wonderful as an alcoholic, concerned mother. she is at times lucid and decisive, and loopily flaky at others. the teenagers are all above-average. amanda wyss, johnny depp, and jsu garcia (credited as nick corri) all bring real fear and emotion to their characters. fine supporting turns from lin shaye as an english teacher, joseph whipp as a police deputy (he would ascend to sheriff of woodsboro) and charles fleischer as the doctor at the dream institute (the voice of roger rabbit) add to every level of the film. heather langenkamp, who i would hold is the most powerful ""final girl"" of them all, is brilliant. she is decisive, powerful, and intelligent, recognizing the situation and, rather than waiting for someone else to deal with it, she attacks it head on. langenkamp is perfect, deliviering a performance that is emotional, frantic, and extremely controlled. just watch the scene in her father's early in the film. the emotional heft she brings gives the movie its' gravitas.this brings me to another aspect of anoes that sets it above the rest: each death is deeply felt by the survivors. this is something craven is quite good at, and all of his movies allow the viewer to linger upon what has happened. the morning after tina dies, you can literally feel the exhaustion and the trauma in nancy, as she struggles to cope, move forward, and, of course, stay awake. in allowing his characters to grieve, we feel each death more realistically, making the movie far more compelling.as i mentioned earlier, craven again explores themes of family failure. tina's mother is off to vegas with a boyfriend, rod's family is depicted only as elvis-haired weirdos at his funeral, and glen's family is a domineering due of denial. and nancy's family, despite their love for her, fail to listen and support her and each other, leading nancy down her path of self-reliance. this is all without mentioning the somewhat murky catalyst for the events of anoes, the families of the children banding together--protectively, vengefully--to burn krueger up decades earlier, ostensibly to stop--but truthfully, to enact retribution upon--krueger the child-molesting killer. while it is suggested that krueger himself is getting his revenge, killing the parents remaining children, one has to wonder, what were the parents to do? and it is in that act, burning krueger alive to be protective, that the parents of the elm street children all find themselves fractured and bleak many years later, unable to properly love the children that they still have.like many of craven's movies, he has invested a great deal in his heroine, nancy thompson, who, in a classic realization of anti-victimization, understands that her fear is what powers the krueger engine, and she need only take that away from him--y'know, after beating his a$$ silly in the films final act--to achieve her desired result. we only have robert shaye to thank for interfering with wes' intended ending, but still, the point has been made: don't f*&% with nancy thompson.a truly wonderful movie, and the finest of its' ilk. thank you wes craven.",N/A

Eighty minutes of endless, repetitive, boring chase-and-crash scenes occasionally interspersed with pieces of the 10 minutes of actual story.If you like close-ups of Ethan Hawke's left foot stomping the clutch, followed immediately by close-ups of his right hand shifting gears, you'll be in Hog Heaven. Because you get to relive that particular moment of cinematic history about a hundred times.This is like a video game... except you're only watching while SOMEONE ELSE is actually playing it.Apparently the cops in Sofia, Bulgaria -- where the flick takes place -- drive Beemer cop cars. Well, first of all, the cops in Sofia are apparently set loose on the streets without one minute of actual driver training, if this idiotic movie is to be believed. And BMW must have had a record sales year, judging by the number of their products that crashed, burned, exploded, ran off bridges, plowed into rivers, hit other cars and trucks, and were otherwise completely destroyed.This has to be one of the stupidest movies made this year, if not in history.Um... needless to say, I'm not recommending it.",Getaway (2013) (Blu-ray)

The movie uniquely catches the essence of what life was like on the frontier of colonial America during the early days of our War for Independence from Great Britain.  Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert are wonderful as a young couple who have left the comforts of Boston in order to make a new life on the American frontier.  Caught up in the turbulence of the times, they lose everything when attacked by the British and their native American allies, and yet, they gain everything in the end....their freedom and their life together in the newly born American nation.  This movie probably seems &#34;sappy&#34; to younger generations but in reality, it shows an America where freedom and liberty where more important than security and comfort.

1605053,"In 1974,  Stephen King released a tale of a troubled girl with the ability to move things with her mind. In 1976, that story became a horror film that went to become a classic. In 1999, a sequel was made and it was soon forgotten. Now, in 2013, a horror remake has hit theaters, and that film is simply called Carrie.Directed by Kimberly Pierce along with producer Kevin Misher and screenwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the team wanted to bring a refined adaption of Stephen King's novel to the silver screen. To give the movie even more credit, acclaimed actresses Chloe Grace Mortez and Julianne Moore were added to the film. With good stars and keeping true to the story, what could possibly go wrong for Carrie? Well, nothing to be honest.If you know the story of Carrie, then you should know that the remake's plot follows the Novel, as well as the 1976 film, to the letter. When it comes to the plot point,  it seems the only differences in this remake are the locations.  That being said, I think what helps the remake's story are additional scenes. Having moments like Carrie testing her powers make all the difference. I think what makes this film's story good is its pacing and willingness to tell the story of Carrie and everyone around her.I'm mixed about the character of Carrie. Sissy Spacek certainly made a name for herself when she played the character in 1976; and no shock in why. Spacek played a troubled girl who was just aching to fit in. However, the same applies to Chloe Grace Mortez. She played the role to the best of her abilities; making her portrayal easy to understand and fully dimensional. As you can see, it is hard for me to decide who is better; but while the two performances are at a stalemate, it is the supporting cast that makes all the difference. While I can't say I was impressed with the performances of the high-school characters,  most of them seem to have a reason for their intentions oppose to just being cliches. The only character I can take a points away from is Gabrielle Wilde's Sue. While both version of the character try to do the right the thing, it seemed that the new version of Sue was little too preachy.Then there is Julianne Moore as Carrie's mother, Margret. I have to say, Julianne Moore shows her talent in this role. The character of Margret White is far more frightening then her 1976 incarnation. The reason for this is subtlety. Julianne's performance was not as over the top as Piper Laiure; which made her that more frightening.I think the big question that this film is trying to answer is whether or not Carrie can be contemporary or is it dated? While certain themes could have been stronger, I think the filmmakers did a great job bringing the story of Carrie to year o 2013. Yet, as I said, I think what would  have  sold a different approach for the film would have been theme of bullying. While it is touched upon, I'm not sure the movie hit the mark at grasping the idea bullying and how it is reflected in today's society. While it was a good attempt, the theme could have been stronger.When we think of Carrie, no doubt we think of the story's major scene where Carrie gets soaked in pig's blood and all hell breaks loose.  When I saw the remake today, I thought this was the weaker scene oppose to the 1976 film. However, after seeing the original again, I have had a second opinion. While the scene might not as much practical effects, it was excited to see. There was nothing in the sequence that was distracting and it made easier to enjoy the rage of Carrie.I know many will not agree, but I have to say: The Carrie Remake is the best film to have the name Carrie to it. Sure there are issues, but the movies strengths comes in its execution. This remakes resurrect Stephen King's story for a new generation; and Carrie has never looked better.You can also see the review here: [...]",Carrie

Many of these gothic treasures were directed by B-Movie King Roger Corman and based on the poems of Edgar Allan Poe.Four discs make up &#34;The Vincent Price Collection.&#34; Disc One consists of &#34;The Pit and the Pendulum&#34; and &#34;The Masque of the Red Death&#34; feature films and special features. The bonus material and movies for &#34;The Haunted Palace&#34; and &#34;The Fall of the House of Usher&#34; make up Disc Two. Disc Three contains &#34;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&#34; and its special features. &#34;Witchfinder General (aka The Conqueror Worm)&#34; and its bonus features close out the collection.Most of the stories in &#34;The Vincent Price Collection&#34; take place in an old cursed gothic castle on a hill that overlooks a town full of frightened villagers. Vincent Price usually plays a disturbed prince or nobleman of some type plotting to kill his visitors or relatives in some ghastly manner. These plot points might all sound redundant, but Price, his co-stars and Roger Corman always deliver the thrills and chills.All the films are presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen of some type. The pictures are vibrant and clean. All the colors and black levels look wonderful. The sound is DTS Master Audio Mono. These movies have never been heard in such clarity until now. The dialogue and rich musical scores scream out at the audience in terror.Each of the six movies include special features. All but one of them has vintage introductions by Vincent Price himself. Audio commentary is provided on them as well, with Producer/Director Roger Corman speaking on his contributions to the set. It also contains interviews and trailers for the films. A 24-page book features an essay by author David Del Valle and rare production stills, promotional photos, and movie posters.&#34;The Vincent Price Collection&#34; is a treat for any fan of classic horror films. Every one of these movies is a masterpiece in its own right. They perfectly capture the wonderful filmmaking of Roger Corman and Vincent Price in their heydays.

1635960,"This Blu ray bundle contain some of Woody Allen's best films.  I'll review each film and it's Blu ray aspects:SLEEPER (1973): 4.5 starsWoody Allen stars, directs and co-wrote (with Marshall Brickman) this hilarious film.  Perhaps not his funniest, but if not, it's close.  Allen plays Miles Monroe who, in 1973, went in the hospital for routine surgery for an ulcer and when things didn't go well, he was placed in a cryogenic state.  Two hundred years later he is found by a couple of scientists who bring him out of his coma.  This entails unwrapping Miles from the aluminum foil that encased his head (complete with glasses) and his extremities.It takes Miles a while to acclimate himself to his situation but the one-liners never stop, and I never stopped laughing or at least broadly grinning.  Some viewers may miss out on some of the inside jokes unless you're familiar with the culture of New York in the 1970's.  It turns out Miles's rescuers are part of an underground movement to overthrow a supreme leader who has instituted a police state mostly devoid of feelings and emotion.  For example when a couple or individual want to have pleasurable sex they just go into a cylindrical closet called an orgasmatron and after a few seconds...satisfaction.  Miles, of course would prefer sex the old fashion way.When the police arrest Miles's scientist rescuers he escapes, but must take on the guise of a domestic robot.  This sequence really shows Allen's ability at physical comedy.  The entire film has many slapstick routines and this is one of the best examples as Allen channels Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and others from the silent era.  When Miles is sent to work for a beautiful but propagandized woman named Luna (Diane Keaton, Allen's off-screen paramour at the time) the fun begins anew.  Keaton is excellent and the repartee between the couple is wonderful to watch.  The film is a hoot to watch.  Certainly one of Allen's best.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  For a film this old, the transfer looks very good.  The film grain is clearly visible but I'm not surprised.  It is not distracting unless you are expecting a smooth background consistent with more digital forms used today.  The clarity is so good you'll be able to see goofs in the film not otherwise noticeable.  Once sequence in particular is when Luna jumps on top of Miles who is inside an inflated rubber suit on the water.  A gunshot releases air from the suit and it is propelled across a lake.  You can easily see that Luna is wearing different shoes on the water than when she started.  And you can see the tow line attached to the suit.  No biggie.  Excellent transfer.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio Mono.  Allen isn't big on surround or even stereo but this mono track is very good.  The film contains a lot of music recorded with Allen and the famous Preservation Hall Jazz Band.  The only extra is a trailer for the film.ANNIE HALL (1977): 5.0 starsTo put it bluntly, this is my favorite Woody Allen film as well as my favorite comedy of all time so I would have a hard time being terribly objective as I believe the film holds up well today.  By this stage of Allen's career he had become more sophisticated in his comedy and less reliant of the slapstick, as good as it was, of his earlier films.  Diane Keaton returns as a romantic foil for Allen once again.  Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comedy writer and two time loser at marriage.  His relationship with Keaton's waspish Annie allows Allen to make this film personal and almost autobiographical in nature.Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are great together. Chasing lobsters and spiders. Keaton also started a whole new trend in women's clothing that lasted years.  This great film has lost little even if the mores of the times are different. Allen is at the top of his game as a director and actor and Diane Keaton shows what a great actress she is...as well as a pretty good singer. Keep your eyes peeled for small roles for Christopher Walken, Shelley Duvall, Sigourney Weaver, Truman Capote and Jeff Goldblum.The Blu ray version, while a step up from the DVD isn't going to wow the viewer like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but it is very good and has very little video noise.  As noted above in ""Sleeper"" the film has plenty of course grain, even during daylight scenes.  The transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The audio comes from a mono master and is converted to a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 (Mono).  This is a dialog driven movie, so little should be expected from surrounds in any case.  The audio is clear and concise.  Woody's not big on special features, so don't look for any.MANHATTAN (1979): 4.5 StarsFollowing up on his smash ""Annie Hall,"" Woody Allen displays his love for the city of New York in all her black and white glory. Woody plays Isaac Davis, an unhappy writer for TV sitcoms. He has a good life with a nice apartment, good friends and is unashamedly dating a 17 year old high school student (Mariel Hemingway).Finally fed up with the crap he has to write, he quits his job to pursue his quest of writing a novel. Now financially strapped, he must move and cut back on expenses including money he sends to his parents. He bemoans the fact that they won't have as good a seat in the synagogue. That they will be far away from God...away from the action. Little gems like that are sprinkled throughout the film.Isaac realizes that while the sex with Tracy (Hemingway) is great, their age difference (25 years) will be an on-going problem. Eventually he dumps her in favor of an opinionated feminist from Philadelphia (a radiant Diane Keaton). She herself recently ended an affair with Isaac's married best friend (Michael Murphy). There is a tangential story line involving Isaac's second ex-wife (Meryl Streep). She divorced Isaac because she finally realized she was a lesbian. In another scene, Jill (Streep) argues with Isaac that surely he must have known she wasn't straight. Isaac quips something about his analyst suggested as much, so he changed analysts.Jill is now writing a ""tell all"" book much to Isaac's consternation. This theme runs throughout the film. Ultimately as funny as it is, this is a more expansive vision of love, art and relationships. It could be argued that it is Woody Allen's greatest film. I would put it a click behind ""Annie Hall.""The Blu ray transfer again is in 1080p resolution with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  It looks very good in its black and white glory.  If anything it seems a bit darker than I recall, but I could be wrong.  In any case it is sharp and consistently clear throughout most of the run.  Like others in the collection, this disc is in DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (2 channels) and is fine.  The film has a Gershwinesqe musical theme and it sounds very good.HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986): 4.5 StarsWhat's not to like in this Woody Allen masterpiece? His screenplay won the Oscar for this story, essentially about 3 much different adult sisters that come from artistic parentage (Lloyd Nolan as the father and Maureen O'Sullivan as the mother who is also the real mother of co-star Mia Farrow). Mickey (Allen) was once married to Hannah (Farrow) and maintains a friendly relationship. Close enough that Hannah sets up Mickey on a disastrous date with her younger scatter-brained sister, Holly (Dianne Wiest, Oscar winner for this film).Hannah is now married to financial advisor Elliott (Michael Caine who also won an Oscar). Elliott, while he still loves Hannah, lusts over her other sister, Lee (a luscious Barbara Hershey). Lee cohabitates with an older artist (Max von Sydow). Allen, as usual, spends a great amount of time showing off New York. In one scene, Holly and her best friend April (Carrie Fisher, ""Star Wars"") meet a cruising architect (an uncredited Sam Waterston) at a party. While he tries to chose who he will go home with, he gives the ladies a tour of his favorite buildings in the city.Allen manages to incorporate the right mix of humor (much of which comes from Mickey's hypochondria), drama and sentiment to make one of his best films. His music ranges from punk rockers ""39 steps"" performing ""Slip into the Crowd"" at CBGB's to jazz legend Bobby Short's ""I'm In Love Again."" Both live pieces performed while Mickey and Holly go on their first date.Some other trivia artifacts include a screen credit for ""apprentice film editor"" Nicole Holofcener who went on to direct ""Please Give"" and ""Friends With Money"" among other films. There are blink-and-you'll-miss-them walk-ons by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and comedian Lewis Black. You can also see some of Farrow and Allen's adoptive children including a pre-teen Soon-Yi Previn who went on to become Mrs. Allen.The Blu ray transfer looks good most of the time.  Seasoned viewers may notice some video noise here and there, but I'm not sure if that is the original film or the transfer.  In any case, it is occasionally noticeable but not terrible distracting.  The audio is another mono track in DTS-HD Master Audio.  Clear, centered and understandable dialog throughout.I will leave it up to you as how to own this bundle of Woody Allen's best films.  As I write this, the Amazon price seems a bit steep ($81) especially since individual prices are collectively less.  But prices change.  This looks like one of those Gold Box deals surely to come.",The Woody Allen Collection: (Annie Hall / Manhattan / Sleeper / Hannah and Her Sisters)

This is not to say this movie is for everyone but it is much much better than 2.5 stars.After watching this film and ""Pop Skull"" I believe Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett are quite the team. The scripting and plot are way out of mainstream and are extremely clever and original. I do not think everything is perfect about this movie (hence one star knock off). For example the title is terrible. Extremely misleading and unoriginal compared to the originality of the film. The film also isn't a gore fest or torture porn yet is wildly disturbing and surprisingly realistic. The directing, as said before is outstanding and contrary to other reviews the acting is believable. The thing that truly pulls this film down is not the directing or the scripting but the filming. The cinematography is terrible. It truly surprises me Wingard allowed it to be this way.Go into this film with an open mind as, chances are, it isn't what you're expecting.

1257713,"GHOST ADVENTURES season one is one of only two DVDs I will review of the infamous TV series ""Ghost Adventures"". My other review is of GHOST ADVENTURES a/k/aGhost Adventures / Ghosts Don't Existand I don't even know what is on that DVD because this is a series that has pestered the public for almost a decade.The often repulsive Zak Bagans, the cute-and-cuddly (well he is to me!) Nick Groff and the clownish Aaron Goodwin are the irrepressible, incorrigible trio of dummies who ""investigate"" the paranormal. As far as I can tell from my research, they steamroll into a site they like, shut everyone out of what they're doing, and lock themselves in to do God-knows-what for the sake of TV ratings.Their science is of course a joke. Their attempts at fraud, hoaxes, fakery, charlatanism, call-it-what-you-like, are so obvious I am shocked they are so popular. But I have a very warm spot in my heart for Nick Groff, who has been looking dreadful this year and it frightens me to think, ""Oh, no, another one's gotten sick."" Fans may recall Ryan Buell's cancer and the rumors that Grant Wilson left ""Ghost Hunters"" due to severe illness.What I love here is the team's blatantly funny nature and their realization that it is worth taking up half an episode featuring that, instead of Zak Bagan's horrific struggle with the English language yammering about the haunted locations' histories. Frankly these guys, with a little work, would be very good comic actors ~ especially Aaron Goodwin. Alas, their love affair is with easy fame, money and rotten, dishonest TV production.This may have been staged, which would make it pure genius, or it really happened, but it demonstrates how I feel about all such shows: the team is heading toward some building when they encounter some tiny children. Zak says hi to them, only to be icily jeered by the little girl with ""My parents told me not to talk to STRANGE MEN."" (Or something hilarious to that effect.) The thought of that still makes me laugh.These boys have talent, flair and love to mug for the camera. In fact the entirety of their show is mugging for the camera. Young Nick, who is actually one of the producers, used to have almost 0% camera time. Happily he is now featured as much as possible since he has always pulled double duty as the cameraman. Just know, fans, it is all B.S., and poorly executed at that.I wish I had a dime for each instance of Zak spitting or huffing into his digital recorder. (That's how EVPs are made, don't you know.)As an old-school paranormal investigator of yesteryear (yes, I was around 15 years old and interested in doing a book about the haunted locations in my hometown, so naive), I often watch these paranormal shows as a way to relax. It's no fun trying to figure out the way they have done their clever tricks, because I already know most of it. It isn't even sophisticated stage illusion ~ I really hate it when I see with my own eyes some of the cast performing lousy ventriloquism to create EVPs.But then that's how EVPs really came into existence.After all, how tough is it to get EVPs when you have at least one jerk standing there, holding a camera and then is never acknowledged as being there? How often do they say, ""It was just the paranormal team"" when they have at least two production crew members there too! That is only the tip of the iceberg.It amazes me how these programs generate actual buzz, as if there were a defensible side, ""their"" side of the story.

Scott Fitzgerald novel has great production design, is lovely to look at, but somehow rings hollow.The key role of Nick Carraway is wasted on Tobey Maguire, who brings nothing at all, besides some rather terse narration.The music is totally anachronistic and completely out of place. It makes you think you're watching some commercial for liquor or something.One thing's for sure: you can't have it both ways in a period film like this. Music by Jay-Z might sell some tickets, but will date this thing terribly in a few years. They should have taken a cue from HBO's Boardwalk Empire by having modern theme music at the beginning and end, and having all source music within the film be true to the period.Di Caprio is very good, but the girl who plays Daisy is utterly forgettable.

1651244,"Everything came together in this superbly nuanced 1942 Ernst Lubitsch comedy filmed in '41 and set in 1939 Warsaw (Poland), except for the timing of its initial release.  Between the completion of filming and the film's premiere the U.S. was attacked and brought into the world war and the film's charismatic female star, Carole Lombard, who gave her finest screen performance here (completely commanding in her comedy and her alluring, enigmatic sexiness), was killed in a plane crash returning home from a war bond rally.  With two major comedy-squelching strikes against it, the film was nearly defeated altogether by blasts from short-sighted critics who claimed to be offended by any number of superficial elements (including the subject matter itself: farcical satire of Nazis in a defeated and occupied European country), while making no real effort to understand it on a deeper and more subtle level.  This was Lubitsch's best film in virtually every aspect of its production, especially its meticulously worked-out story and screenplay in collaboration with the Hungarian and American dramatists Melchior Lengyel and Edwin Justus Mayer, respectively.The term ""theater of war"" applies literally to this film, as a troupe of Warsaw stage actors led by husband-and-wife stars Joseph and Maria Tura (Jack Benny and Carole Lombard) cleverly and courageously perform a mission involving a series of risky off-stage performances, with some tricky impersonations, to take down a respected professor operating as a high-level spy and informer for the Nazis.  The film is often suspenseful, ironically heightening the impact of the comedy, both in its hilarious running verbal and sight gags and sudden comic surprises.  Benny is right there comedically with Lombard, absolutely at the top of his game, and is the only performer in radio, TV or film history who could have pulled off the ingenious, tailor-made (Lubitsch was the son of a tailor in Germany) final scene to perfection.There are a number of remarkable supporting performances, featuring several by Lubitsch film veterans: Sig Ruman's Colonel Ehrhardt set the comic template for the overweight, minimally competent, buffoonish yes-man (or ""Heil""-man) German officer still seen two decades later in watered-down form on ""Hogan's Heroes"";  Felix Bressart's Greenberg provides a moving Jewish perspective; and Tom Dugan as the troupe's faux-Hitler delivers two of the funniest lines in the film. Stanley Ridges nails his villainous role of Professor Siletsky, who subverts his intellectualism to fit Nazi ideology (which is truly frightening).  Robert Stack, 17 years before becoming TV's Eliot Ness, plays the heroic young military pilot, who although he is on Joseph Tura (Benny)'s side patriotically, is a thorn in his side due to his romantic obsession with his wife.  (Stack is a bit too stiff to be convincing, so it's Benny's exasperated reactions to him that have to be relied upon to derive comedy from this character.)Both the black-and-white picture transfer (kept in the original aspect ratio of 137:1) and the sound remastering (24-bit) are top-notch.  There is a new audio commentary by film historian David Kalat who loves this film and knows everything about it.  Disc Two contains a 53-minute 2010 scholarly French documentary on Lubitsch's film career.  The clips are good, but attention, TALKING HEADS ALERT!  There is also the 45-minute 1916 silent film comedy, ""Pinkus's Shoe Palace,"" which Lubitsch directed and starred in, playing the Jewish title character who goes from academic failure to rising to the top of the shoe-biz ladder.  And finally we get to hear a couple of half-hour radio plays from 1940 and 1943.  The first features Jack Benny, Claudette Colbert, Basil Rathbone and Lubitsch as themselves in an extended one-joke routine about Benny's prodigious ego being deflated as he tries to talk his way into a starring screen role.  The second is an adaptation of ""To Be Or Not to Be"" starring real-life husband and wife William Powell and Diana Lewis as the Turas, with Sig Ruman reprising his Colonel Ehrhardt.  After viewing the film this reduction for radio feels like a perfunctory and hollow exercise (although Ruman still has his same impeccable comic delivery).The 28-page accompanying photographically illustrated booklet contains an informative essay on the film, as well as an intriguing Ernst Lubitsch NY Times op-ed defending ""To Be Or Not to Be.""",To Be or Not to Be

1601839,"The great Isabelle Huppert must surely be one of the boldest, most fearless actors at work today.  But I must confess, her films are becoming increasingly hit-or-miss in my mind.  Even in her most uninspired pieces, though, I usually find Huppert absolutely fascinating.  I think that this was, perhaps, my greatest disappointment with the farce ""My Worst Nightmare.""  It is not a bad movie, per se, it just lacks any amount of originality.  And instead of offering anything new, Huppert serves up a character that she could play in her sleep!  This is a quintessential opposites-attract type comedy that pairs an uptight businesswoman (Huppert) with a irrepressible and irresponsible lothario (Benoit Poelvoorde).  Can his impulsiveness thaw her icy demeanor?  And can her seriousness make him a better man?  I bet you might already know the answer to these questions!  More to the point is whether you will care or not.As ""My Worst Nightmare"" opens, Huppert is paired with Andre Dussolier (actually my favorite character).  Their child is in school with Poelvoorde's son, and the two boys form a fast friendship.  This is especially useful as Social Services is threatening Poelevoorde and his wayward nature.  So he lets the boy establish a bond with the more affluent and stable family.  Of course, he and Huppert are complete antagonists, but Dussolier is enamored of the man's free spirit.  Before you know it, the impact of this new relationship realigns everything in the picture.  And where the movie starts out as an over-the-top romp, it morphs into something slightly more effective as these changes come into being.  The beginning of ""My Worst Nightmare"" is so overdone with clownish characterizations, this shift is all the more welcome.  But still, even as the movie gains more heart, it never really compensates with much originality in its main story thread.Interestingly, I quite liked much of the peripheral material.  Poelevarde's son brings an interesting dynamic to the movie and I liked how the family adapted throughout the screenplay.  Huppert, though, has an underdeveloped side plot set in the art world that plays by extremely conventional satirical stereotypes.  As I mentioned from the start, Huppert's uptight character reads like a stock player from countless other films as does Poelevarde's obnoxious boor.  Both are talented actors that don't quite transcend the routine characterizations they've been boxed into.  As the film progresses, though, they both have a chance to push out of the expected to become fully rounded beings.  The movie, truthfully, starts at about 2 1/2 stars (for my taste) and finishes at about 4 stars.  I'll split the difference, but this terrific cast deserved better material!

It pulled a lot of bits of information together and created a story line using the work of reports. It takes FDR past the polio and rehab all the way through to his death. Edward Herrmann was a good fit for the role and allowed the viewer to focus on the story not on the actor. It covered the sexual aspect of the marriage and presidency. It also showed the political situation  and the events of World War II but not in great detail. It was mainly covered from the perspective of ways they affected the marriage. There was very  little coverage of the Roosevelt family beyond Husband and Wife.

Parts of the back-story of Whitaker&#8217;s life work great, while others are just too convenient to be believable.Flight tries to be more than just a plane crash film. The film delves deep into the destruction alcoholism can cause, and also attempts to tackle the question of what it is to be a hero.While drudging up some very interesting and heavy material, considering the film&#8217;s length of 2hr 18min, a much clearer statement of intent would have been nice. Since Captain Whitaker is an alcoholic, there is a ton of backlash against him, but the dialogue on the subject of whether or not a drunk can be a hero, is far from concluded.7.5/10Errata: Can an MD-80 aircraft fly upside down?

'Just Go For It' is a return to what we liked about Sandler in the first place. Jennifer Aniston and Sandler have good chemistry and well she is so beautiful to look at. This film has many laugh out loud moments and a sweet if predictable story.If you liked The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates, then Just Go With It will be right up your alley, it is a return to Sandler's gentler side of corny romantic comedy rather then an obnoxious arrogant loser.

Point is, part of what we love doing most every October, is watching a lot of 80s horror. We made a list of our favorites when we were kids, and came looking to purchase them. 80s horror feels nothing like today's horror, so to like this movie, you have to be into this sort of thing. It's filmed differently, paced differently. The whole vibe is different. Dead End Drive-In is a great example of what we love about this stuff. I don't describe the plots of movies.

Riding roughshod over the entire town is the aptly named Hester Appleby (Kathleen Howard).  ""She must have been weaned on a pickle.""  Naturally, the old fogies are all against `show folk.'  It doesn't help matters that not-so-little Shirley (as Wendy Ballantine) enlists the children of the town to put on a show guaranteed to irritate and incite the stogy old geezers into an apoplectic fit of grand proportions.  Poor Shirley finds out she's adopted then run out of town on the same day!  This was not her finest hour.  Shirley was no longer the cute little tap-dancing urchin of yore.  She was getting older, more awkward, unable to transition into age befitting roles.  It didn't help that this film felt like a throwaway, something that sat around for a hundred years that no one wanted to get stuck doing.

733240,"Lovers of European cinema, or lovers in general, should be enchanted by ""Sex and Lucia"" (S&L;), although the complex storyline is a bit hard to follow in translation.  However, that just warrants a second viewing, which I look forward to with much anticipation.S&L; is a ultimately a story about the deepening relationships between lovers, and the degree to which they progress from physical intimacy to emotional intimacy and ultimately life and death.  What appear at the beginning of the film to be casual flings turn into much significant couplings with unanticipated consequences.  The viewer must piece together the overall storyline from the creative vision of writer/director Julio Medem, who jumps back and forth in time and films some scenes with an ethereal, dreamlike quality that has the viewer wondering whether the events portrayed really happened or not.  Medem's techniques create a European art-house cinematic quality for the film, but they also create a puzzle to be solved by the viewer.There are many other attractive elements within S&L;, chief among them two of the lead actresses, the stunningly beautiful Paz Vega in the title role and the equally enticing Elena Aneya in a seductress role.  It is impossible for me to choose which actress is more appealing or who gives a better performance.  Fortunately, we get to see all of the charms of both actresses.  There are several absolutely delicious scenes in the movie, including a loveplay scene with Vega's character Lucia and her partner wielding a Polaroid camera, and a seduction scene in a park with Aneya's character Belen, in which she entices her prey by explaining her mom's profession and her living arrangements.  The male character in both of these scenes, Lorenzo, is a tortured writer, but with women like this in his life, one has to wonder a bit why he is suffering so much.That said, there are a few weak components of S&L.;  The actors playing the roles of Lorenzo (Tristan Ulloa) and the role of Elena (Najwa Nimri) weren't well cast, in my opinion.  It was hard for me to believe Ulloa was an intellectual, and Nimri seemed a little old for her role, and was nowhere near as enticing as the other two female leads.  But the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and I will be a repeat viewer, both to understand the story better and to appreciate the film even more.",N/A
265484,"The Betty Smith novel from which this movie is adapted, was one of my mother's favorite books; and since it was in her collection and readily available, it's one of the first books I read as a youngster. Mom loved movies too and I'm sure she went to see this when it first came out in 1945...but amazingly, today was the first time I've seen this exceptional film. The novel is divided into five books and this film roughly covers the events in Books 1, 3 and 4. It is a slice-of-life story of a second generation Irish-American family living in turn-of-the century (1912) Brooklyn. Katie and Johnny Nolan have two children; 13 year old Francie and 12 year old Neeley. Katie is the primary breadwinner, washing floors in the tenement where they live and collecting rags for sale. Johnny is an alcoholic singing waiter, who has trouble holding down a job. Francie is a sensitive and intelligent teen, a good student with a talent for writing. James Dunn, who plays Johnny was a leading man in his early career, but hit a rough patch, so this role which earned him an Oscar, was a huge comeback for him. Dorothy McGuire, who plays Katie, also delivers an inspired performance. But the best performance - arguably - is by child actor, Peggy Ann Garner, as Francie and she won a Juvenile Academy Award for her performance; but as with many gifted child actors, she never caught on as an adult. Also look for Joan Blondell as Aunt Sissie (Katie's sister); and Lloyd Nolan as Officer McShane, who befriends the family. Great direction by Elia Kazan, in his directorial debut, this is a masterpiece of the film maker's art.",A Tree Grows in Brooklyn VHS

1358893,"LEGENDARYI will admit right here and now that I am a fan of John Cena's movies, yes it is true. I thought ""The Marine"" was a fun pointless action movie and that ""12 Rounds"" while seeming like a ""Die Hard"" spin off was just as fun. This was Cena's third film for WWE and I have to say that it may be his best. It is a realistic drama in which John had to actually act and he was in a co starring role. For some reason when this first came out I wanted to see this more so than any other he had been in.Cal Chetley [Devon Graye] is one of those kids who is just an outcast and is having problems at home. His mother [Patricia Clarkson] is over protective, his father is dead, and his older brother [Cena] is the black sheep of the family. While he is a scrawny guy he wants to join the schools wrestling team like his father and brother did before him. the thing is he knows nothing about it and his mother is strongly against it.Now I know some of you are reading that and are saying ""that does not sound to interesting"". Well if you were thinking that then you would be very wrong for thinking that, especially seeing Cena in this type of film. I have to say that I was very impressed by John here in this film as the brother who has to come back to help his little bro. He is actually really good here especially during the first half of the film. Seeing him play the drunk outcast haunted by his past it is new side of Cena. The last half is more of the guy that you see in the WWE helping out kids and such. Don't get me wrong the role called for that but still.Devon is really good here in the lead role and makes the film more believable. And for any out there that says a kid like that would never make it in amateur wrestling has no idea what they are talking about. As someone who wrestled all throughout school and trains it every day even now I can tell you the little guys are usually the nastiest and most hard workers. Was I one of those guys, maybe, maybe not. Patricia is also excellent here as their mother and Danny Glover is always fun.I was glad to see Mel Damski directed this since he is a producer and directed many episodes of one of my favorite shows of all time, ""Psych"". Also it should be noted that the writer of this film John Posey is also in the film as Coach Tennent. He did a good job on both fronts. Anyway this is actually a good film from the WWE and is one of the few dramatic films they have made. I say give the film a chance, I liked it.",Legendary

I'll just say that I came out of the film happy to have seen it, I got quite a lot of good laughs all the way through, and my final impression was what a basically sweet story it was with sweet and likeable characters.  Only a scene in a lap dancing bar made it a bit inappropriate for younger teens, but otherwise, it is a good story imparting some valuable life lessons for young people who think people over 30 know nothing.  The two main characters were actually quite nice and lovable guys with refreshingly positive attitudes about life and how to treat other people, and ultimately they came out on top preceisely because of these traits.

I mean the horned king was an immortal skeleton, he raised an army of the undead, and he had one of the best disney villian deaths! They also deleted a bunch of scenes that were too graphic like one of the undead slicing a mans neck and torso and a man being desolved by the mist which they will probably never feature under the deleted scenes. I bet a live action movie would be creepy as hell! It was based on the series chronicles of prydain but in it the horned king was just a man and not even the main bad guy at that, so disney's version of him was way coole! But it seems they couldn't  develop the characters to make them interesting enough to care about them.My favorite characters included the horned king, creeper, gurgi and Fflewddur with his mandoline. So that pretty much tells you something because Taran and Eilonwy are suppose to be the main characters especially Taran and you don't seem to care about them really.

558287,"Viewed: 4/13Rate: 44/13: What seems like a good horror mystery story for C.H.U.D. gets undone by the lazy ending. The film is marked by a series of ups and downs: acceptable story, above than average acting, low intelligence, implausible plot, and enough suspense to keep the pacing going. The last fifteen minutes, especially the idea of gassing the sewers, makes me to think of the storm drains. Aren't they impossible to seal off? That's when I knew the director became lazy as evidenced by the sight of the storm drain in one of the scenes as the police captain gets gunned down. Obviously, the laziness is also manifested in placing the whole mystery on one guy, Wilson, who is supposedly the head of some company. If they are going to place chemicals underground in the sewers of New York City, I am sure that enough people will see that happening and raise alarms. But, the police actually help to cover up the matter. Highly unlikely. All in all, C.H.U.D. never got it together in what should have pass for a good horror film but did get the three into Home Alone.",N/A

905793,"EDIT 06/20: While I don't doubt that some people are experience audio problems with this release, I must point out that clearly not everyone is experiencing the bass drop-out problem. I, for one, did not - had I been anything less than satisfied with this, I would've been just as angry as anyone. Do a little research, read some forums on other sites concerning this disc, and see what is being said. I heard robust, full bass throughout while listening in 5.1 DTS-HD. The problem, whatever its cause, is clearly not being universally experienced. Think before click ""not helpful"" simply because a person had a good experience with Rockshow. (I received a review copy from the distributor, full release version, for the purposes of reviewing on a separate website - completely independent of Eagle Rock, I might add, and without compensation)The full 129 minute concert is a blast from start to finish. What a show, back when McCartney could build it around solo material almost exclusively and not disappoint anyone. I enjoy the non-McCartney tunes for the most part too - especially Denny's ""Time to Hide"" (always thought it was a highlight of Speed of Sound) and his revisiting of his Moody Blues classic ""Go Now."" So much energy on stage, with McCartney's voice sounding incredible on numbers like ""Call Me Back Again"" and ""Beware My Love.""Picture is framed at 1.78:1 - presumably representing (approximately) its theatrical aspect ratio. I think its a good transfer, but it must be pointed out that the footage is highly inconsistent. Close ups and medium shots generally fare best. the limitations of filming on 35mm in a dark, cavernous arena are all too apparent during softer focus (and grainy) shots.The 5.1 DTS-HD MA sounds terrific. It's not fancy (the rear speakers are generally just crowd noise/applause) but the instruments and vocals are punchy and clear (great way to take in McCartney's bass work, which really thumps).The only extra is a 10 minute montage (called ""A Very Lovely Party"") of home movie-type footage and some enthusiastic (and sometimes amusing) fan reaction footage. The time listed on the back of the package is 139 minutes because it includes this 10 minute piece (Eagle Rock does that with all their concert DVD/Blu-rays).Digibook package has a good new liner notes essay. The disc is slid into a cardboard pocket - which I hate because I don't like touching the disc surface and sliding it against cardboard every time I take it in or out. Relatively loose fitting at least.Can't recommend this more highly to see McCartney at his live performance peak.",N/A

1647014,"In DreamWorks ""The Croods"" a prehistoric family embarks on the very first road trip ever!  After their cave is destroyed, they must go in search of a new home - with the help of a handsome stranger named Guy.Who are The Croods?  They are Dreamwork's rendition of a caveman family - the father, Grug, is always warning his family about the dangers outside.  He wants to keep his family safe - ""in the dark.""Grug has a wife and a restless teenage daughter named Eep - there is also a not-too-bright overweight son, a strange growling baby, and a crusty grandma character.  Then along comes Guy - a handsome stranger (with a cute pet named Belt) who lives for adventure and ""following the sun.""  Eep is in love.  Grug is none too thrilled.Guy leads the Crood family through a very colorful prehistoric CG landscape filled with all sorts of neon bright fanciful and furry critters that happen to have very large teeth.  Adventures ensues - despite the fact Grug is completely against them ensuing.  Will the family find a new home?  Or will they get eaten up by one of the many weird surrealistic creatures?  Will Grug and Guy ever get along?  After all, Guy is so different.  He uses his brain and comes up with brand new ideas.  Grug believes in just relying on his brawn.  Well, to find the answers to these questions, you'll just have to watch the movie and see.The visuals in this movie are fantastic.  Lots of interesting and colorful ""eye candy"" to keep little kids transfixed.  However.....and it's a BIG however...I feel the story leaves a bit to be desired - from an adult standpoint.  Like I said, little kids will no doubt love it.  But the plot is just so clich&eacute; and typical....the humor is so lazy and un-clever it makes you want to yawn (think:  Hotel Transylvania).  I think I chuckled twice during the whole film - and I thought it was going to be an outrageous comedy!!!  Not so.  The Croods is not clever and sophisticated like the Shrek movies.  It is even less sophisticated than the Ice Age movies, in my opinion.The characters are not very unique - you never really warm up to any of them, like you do with Shrek or Donkey or even Sid the Sloth.  Eep as the teenage daughter is so woefully predictable.  And what's with the weird hourglass figure and overly shapely legs?  Is that really necessary for a kid's movie?Certain comments Grug makes about ""killing the grandma"" struck me as disturbing.  I know it's just supposed to be comedy, but still...The thing that bothered me the most about the movie, is that it literally hits you over the head with too much sappy family ""I love you's""....it seemed forced.Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the movie - as you can probably tell!  I recommend you see it once - just for the visuals...but maybe rent before buying.  Unless you have a child under 10 - then go ahead and purchase the movie.  They'll love it!",N/A
1604020,"I love the 1920s and was eager to watch these Australian episodes about a female detective. The TV shows are based on a series of novels by Kerry Greenwood which I have not read--and now likely won't.The only thing I liked about these shows was the atmosphere created by the talented costumers, set designers, etc. I was disappointed to discover that Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries is ersatz Murder She Wrote. The acting, plots, and direction are hackneyed and the opposite of entertaining. You can easily figure out who the murderer is by: (1) who cries the most over the death, and (2) who appears to be the least likely murderer.This is a 4 disk set that features 13 episodes and also offers extras including cast interviews, information about the sets, etc. These extras are nicely done and more entertaining than the shows themselves.This could have been a great TV show if it had been edgier and less arch.

I can easily say I was not disappointed in the least!  BBC's Natural History Unit just keeps getting better, as impossible as that may seem.

1095383,"A small film about gay Chinese men in London. That's not an easy life and being gay in London, and I guess it is the same everywhere or in many places, is rather disappointing and offers flimsy security. The world outside is hostile, very hostile at times since some young men are so bored that hunting gays is a funny game and since they can't hunt foxes any more they have to look for some substitute animals, and for them gays are just as good as any other game, and I do not mean a card game, rather some living creature that is assimilated to a boar or a hare. And that can be a hairy bore in a way.The fact that the main characters are of Chinese origin does not change anything in the story. In fact it does not even make it deeper or more profound since there is absolutely no trace of racism in the film. The fate of gays in London is shallow and cruel especially when they are young and when they do not want to get attached, probably their Buddhist heritage, but more probably the freedom they want to keep against all odds because they were clandestine for so many centuries that they can't even think of being or going stable which would mean telling everyone including their own parents they are gay. Somewhere they see their parents suddenly hit by nightmares about what they may or may not do in bed with their alter egos.So they live on the side of real humanity. They make believe everyone and themselves they are happy with a one night flimsy superficial sex episode that they call making love though it is nothing and there is no real love in this quick rapid short episode, nothing but pretending. And they kick the transient visitor out or they kick themselves out with the fair intention that it was one time and there will be no second. It is sad, very sad, even painful to see them smile and laugh in a life that is nothing but a dream of a life, in fact a nightmare of a real life.At the very end the director maybe insinuates that maybe perhaps there might be some further developments, a second night after the first, but under duress. That is still not a life. That is still not human. Man, just like women, needs stability and continuity, flexible and fluid adaptability but within some stable frame. Changing sexual partner every night, or even twice a night is not exactly psychologically viable. But some pretend, and that pretension is very emotionally expensive, that it is the basic condition for their happiness and they forget that one day they won't be beautiful any more, they won't be young any more, they won't be desirable any more, they won't find any real satisfaction in internet pornography any more, if ever, when they won't find partners any more.I find the film rather sad though we could consider it as a warning. But there is little effectiveness in giving a warning to the Titanic; It is bound to sink. Or it has to be redesigned completely.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",N/A

105881,"I was six years old when I saw this film with my parents during its initial release. Needless to say it left a lasting impression with me. The Searchers is one of ""the Duke's"" finest performances in the prime of a great acting career and is well worth a place in any DVD library. The action and realism are a bit dated compared to today's standards but was state of the art for the mid-1950's. Yet, the scenery, filming locations, and cinematography are timeless. The only real issue I have with the film is the use of anachronistic weapons depicted for the historical period. The film is supposed to take place from 1868 thru 1873. However, most of the weaponry shown in the film was from a later time period. Throughout the film the main characters use 1873 Colt Army or shorter barrel versions of the same pistol, and the Winchester lever action rifles look like the 1892 version. Perhaps I'm just being ""picky"", but it seems to me at best the pistols of the period would have been a 1860 Colt or 1858 Remington conversion from cap and ball to cartridge, and the Winchesters would have been the 1866 model. Yet, the historical inaccuracy does not diminish the fact that this film is one of the great definitive westerns.  I also highly recommend the book by Alan LeMay which has a much better ending than the film (no spoiler intended), however the film is a very good adaptation. Watch the film and then read the book and you will not be disappointed.",N/A

Somali pirates capturing an American ship off the Horn of Africa is a timely and fraught topic.The film's verisimilitude is so powerful at times I really did drift into thinking that I was watching a documentary. There's a lot of money up on the screen: cargo vessels, beat-up pirate skiffs, ports, open ocean, Navy warships. Even so it was the performances and the pacing that kept my eyes glued to the screen. I found every last character so well played and gripping, right down to the medic who appears toward the end, that I wondered if Director Paul Greenglass had not hired real corpsmen, or real pirates.Sound is used masterfully. Loud, pulsing music suddenly stops at key moments. Yeah, it's an old trick, but it works especially well here.This is the kind of film I am grateful to have seen in a theater, and I am eager to recommend to friends. Even though action-adventure is not my genre, I'd re-watch this film, and that is high praise.This film is so consistently excellent that one must ask why it doesn't raise to the level of a ten-out-of-ten star film. ""Captain Phillips"" touches on some of the biggest issues of our times: the collision between the First World and the Third World, poverty in Africa, jihad. ""Captain Phillips"" assiduously avoids addressing any of these issues.From this film, viewers would never know that the millions of dollars in ship ransom that pirates claim goes to al-Shabaab, the terrorist group that attacked a mall in Kenya. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) offers rationalizations for piracy: Western nations stole Somalia's fish, and piracy is the ""tax"" for that. Pirates made millions of dollars through piracy. Those millions were not pocketed by the pirates themselves, who work for others. No reference is made to Somalis, in 1993, dragging an American soldier through Mogadishu's streets. Americans were attempting to help Somalis after a famine.Phillips does mention that his ship, waylaid by pirates, was carrying food aid for hungry Africans.None of this is gone into in any detail in the script, and it could have been.Rather, the First World - Third World clash, and the clash of civilizations and religions is communicated solely through images, and, in the absence of a complex script, the images speak very loudly.Somalia is depicted as a dusty, dry, hellhole. Somalis are depicted as chaotic, unproductive, violent, angry, greedy, and lawless. Somalis are dressed in discarded Western clothing and plastic sandals, or simply barefoot. They live in huts. They only things they possess that give them any power is the guns that they got from Westerners. Somalis hold life cheaply and are ready to kill and die.Americans are depicted as orderly, disciplined, skilled, courageous, and productive. Americans devote massive amounts of money to saving one life.When the Somali pirates manage to get their ladder against the Maersk Alabama, the image suggests the pirates as invasive parasites attempting to assault a larger, more successful organism. Whereas the Westerners have built a civilization that creates ships and commerce, the Somalis have created only violence, chaos and greed. They must take guns that they themselves can't manufacture and invade more productive peoples in order to survive. It's an ugly picture, and I can completely understand if Somalis are enraged by this film.Andrew O'Hehir, Salon's film critic, apparently was enraged by the film, and he lambasted it. It was distressing to O'Hehir to watch ""corn-fed, gym-toned"" Americans struggle against ""malnourished"" Africans. That the thin Africans were holding guns to the heads of the Americans did not disturb him. O'Hehir calls the film ""unpleasant and uncomfortable."" He hated watching American military rescue an American hostage. What a sick dude, you want to say. But his view is all too common.I greatly enjoyed this movie. It could have been an all-time classic if the script had offered some insight into the issues the images depicted.",N/A
1490349,"When I saw this in theaters, I mostly enjoyed it, but I found myself disturbed and I was taken out of the movie experience when the shooting in the laboratory part happened. I stopped being entertained at that point and was soberly reminded of recent shootings all over the country very similar to the one portrayed in the movie. The rest of the movie was enjoyable and I laughed at how unstoppable the really stylish bad guy at the end was. Overall, I enjoyed the theatrical experience other than that one scene that took me out of it. Having stewed on it for a few months, I came to admire the boldness of the inclusion of that scene. I was moved by the fact that because of recent events and the plausibility of a shooting like the one in the movie it was included. It just made the story more believable. So while that scene is still hard to watch, I can respectfully admire the point it is trying to get across. As far as the Blu-ray is concerned, the audio was a blast to listen to. I love it when normal scenes take advantage of surround sound in addition to the action scenes. I felt completely immersed in the movie. The picture quality was great and the film grain was intact the whole time. As far as the extras are concerned, I watched every last bit of them. The audio commentary was worth a listen, but I won't be returning to it any time soon. The participants talked over each other a lot and also alluded to a lot of personal anecdotes without really going into what they meant. But, it was also really informative on certain scenes, especially the scene at Marta's house. I found about half of the commentary very interesting and the other half was nonsense. The rest of the special features were great, their only downfall being that there are not more of them. That said, the best buy exclusive disc did not have anything that compelled me to get that version. It seemed like mostly fluff stuff. So if anyone has that version, they should post what they think of the exclusive content. Overall, worth the purchase. It holds up well to repeat viewings and the Blu-ray is top notch. Make sure and watch the deleted scenes, they add some nice flavor. As far as PG-13 content goes, this movie earned it for a bunch of violence and some language. I would preview it before showing it to younger kids, due to the disturbing nature of a few of the scenes (what the people try to do to Marta at her house, and the laboratory shooting in particular). On a final note, this movie fits in perfectly with the other Bourne movies. Enjoy and thanks for reading!",N/A

Stefan Kocan was excellent as Fernando, the captain of the guards.all the rest were very good, but again, not golden age quality,but what you can expect to see today in a major opera house.The production values were very good. The camera work and lighting fine, the direction (except for the somewhat over the top humping in the gypsy scene) was fine, the orchestra excellent and the conducting was appropriate, but seemed to drag a bit at times.",N/A

1646920,"*I received a screener copy of this film for review; I am in no way compensated for my reviews.Growing up, one of my favorite non-horror 80s movies was THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Like many others of my generation, even back then I recognized the high school caste system that was in place and the ridiculousness of it; John Hughes simply brought this out in the open, for the less-knowing masses to see.  Anchor Bay's latest release DETENTION OF THE DEAD takes this high school hierarchy a step further and brings zombies into the mix.  The result is a hilarious horror romp that entertains on several levels.I am impressed with this film for several reasons.  This could have been a disaster, given the somewhat cheesy premise, but director Alex Craig Mann makes sure the movie never takes itself too seriously and keeps the action flowing at a nice pace.  The film looks great, the actors are top notch, and the production value appears high overall.  In short, this is a damn good zombie flick.One major reason for DETENTION OF THE DEAD's success is the acting.  Each actor skillfully portrays their stereotyped character with great ease.  From the arrogant, bullying jock, to the self-centered cheerleader, to the dorky, big-hearted geek...every level of high school society is represented here in a monumental way.Another reason is the special effects.  The zombies look great and the gore is fantastic.  I am particularly impressed with the carnage, as I don't believe any good living dead flick should be without some gore.  And the production team doesn't spare much expense.  There's even a horrific zombie rat!!DETENTION OF THE DEAD is a major win for me and I think every zombie fan should check it out.  It is a film that knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be anything but funny and horrifying.  If you like SHAUN OF THE DEAD, I will wager you will like this one.  The film hits store shelves next week, so give it a look.",Detention Of The Dead

1637728,"My wife and I discovered this series on Netflix because of our love of British/European police procedurals and dramas.The basic premise is a bit tired at first. Jack Taylor is a former Garda officer (Irish police) who gets himself into a lot of trouble some of which is the result of him getting lost in the bottle. Nothing new there. But, once you get past that, the individual ""episodes"" and the on-going story of Jack Taylor and his life in Galway are well-written and well-acted.Each episode is really more like a movie in itself (IMDB even lists each episode as standalone TV movies). They run around an hour and a half (likely meant to be two hours with commercials) and with Set 1 you get three of them: The Guards, The Pikemen, and The Magdalen Martyrs. The latter episode is particularly interesting seeing as Nora-Jane Noone, who acts in a supporting role here, starred in the Magdalen Sisters which also goes into the themes in the episode.The stories center around Galway which is rarely seen in movies and shows like this and the character of Jack Taylor toes a fine line between helping those that need it and getting just about everyone else to hate him. Plus, I love that, outside of Iain Glen, all the other actors are Irish, some of which were actually born in Galway, lending a lot more authenticity to the series.I'm not sure if there's a great way to compare this series to others out there. The character and stories aren't quite as serious as Helen Mirren and Prime Suspect, Jack isn't as savant as Robson Green's series, and while he does partner up at some point, you don't get the usual British theme of having partners crossing class lines.But, if you're a fan of British mysteries and detective dramas, I think you'll really enjoy this series. Sure, an ex-cop, alcoholic private investigator getting into trouble all the time sounds tired, but there's a lot more than that. Think of that as the starting anchor that just leads you to the rest of the ship...there's a lot more than that one thing.This is the first set and, based on the episodes that have been released (and appear to be getting produced), there will probably be a set 2 sometime soon.","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

I found it to be thoroughly pro-torture because all the Americans (i,e, -the sympathetic characters in the film) are pro-torture, or torturers themselves.  However the part that completely lost me was the last half hour, the raid that ended with the killing of bin Laden.  Most of the time the screen is black, with no picture, except for the occasional flashes of night vision; it&#8217;s like listening to a radio show, only the show doesn&#8217;t make any sense.

271886,"The Amazon review mentions 1930s gangster films and I can see some relation to that.  It's got the pathos and certain 'lack of reality' about it that old time gangster movies seemed to have more of than some of the better modern classics like Good Fellas or Scarface.  So if you're in the mood for that and you have some reference or appreciation for that kind of movie in the first place, this might be more enjoyable.  Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough but I'd still take Carlito's Way, Casino or any of the other modern classics in terms of a more meaty and believable story line.  Guess I'm still a sucker for realism.  It's not to say the movie was bad, just not quite 5 star in terms of entertainment value and involving plot.  I do like to watch C. Walken in action though, and his performance as well as some of the other bad guys (notably Lawrence Fishburn in an early role) was pretty good.  The cops were a bit over the top, but again this may be part of the ""Bogart"" tradition the movie was aspiring for.  Just not sure how well it translated to modern New York (or at least 1990 New York).  In spite of the movie's release date being 1990, it's still got an 80s vibe about it (hairstyles and music) though you can feel the dawn of the 90s as well.  The ending is almost noirish, which compared to the predictable alternative, was a good thing.On a 5-star scale, and in terms of what I like in modern gangster movies, I'd give the plot 3 stars, acting 4 stars, atmosphere/cinematography 4.5 stars.  I felt the movie would have been better with if the plot had been allowed to thicken a bit and characters had developed a bit more.  It seemed to be going somewhere in the beginning but around 2/3 of the way through it turned into a big shooting spree with the cops disregarding all police procedure in their quest to snuff out the king.  Still, it's always kind of fun to see Walken in action even if parts of the movie were a bit slow and other parts simplistic (""stylistic"" to some).  But it did have enough atmosphere to keep me watching till the end.",N/A

1247302,"Its something of a mystery as to why anyone would want to remake the original George Romero film The Crazies. It was a very forgettable film, but the premise was a good idea. In the case of this remake Breck Eisner managed to improve upon the story and make it worth seeing. I found the film to echo numerous similar stories, and there really isnt anything new that comes to play here. Added to that are the usual familiar formulas with less than plausable sequences that expect the audience to be a little gullible and to suspend a great deal of reality in the process. Some of the subject matter is too far fetched to ever expect it to be anywhere near believable if something like this were to ever happen in real life. None the less there are some genuinly freightening moments through out that work well even if they may seem to feel rather familiar. I also noticed there was a good job with the sound on this film. The work the sound crew did on this is worth taking notice of. I rarely take note of sound achievements in film unless its one of the obvious classics that won an oscar and is remembered for its over all sound quality. This one had me examining the sound a little closer and I couldnt help noticing the work done here where the sound is concerned was above average and worth recognizing. The film is not really awesome, but far from terrible. Its sort of a blend of The hills have eyes and a decent zombie movie, never getting as good as either, but still fairly entertaining. I saw Quarantine last night and felt it was superior on all levels though. it is a film with a similar story to tell, but its much more terrifying and ceetainly between the two the hands-down better choice if you happen to be wanting to decide between one or the other.",N/A

98461,"""Dirty"" Harry Callahan is one of those iconic characters that stands apart from the crowd. Who hasn't heard someone say, ""You've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?""And he certainly lives up to the legend in ""Dirty Harry,"" a grimy cop thriller where morals are grey and justice isn't always served by the law. Clint Eastwood gives a quietly menacing performance that dominates every scene he's in, and sets up the standard for world-weary cops who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty in pursuit of justice.A serial killer referred to as ""Scorpio"" is killing people in San Francisco, and even sends a letter to the police demanding money. If he doesn't get his way, he's going to kill again. The man on the case is Detective ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Eastwood), who manages to thwart Scorpio's efforts to kill a Catholic priest. The serial killer is so enraged that he rapes and buries a young girl alive, and threatens the police with her death if they don't give in to his demands.Harry is sent on a wild chase through San Francisco with a giant bag of money, and eventually is able to corner and stop the Scorpio killer (Andrew Robinson). Unfortunately for everybody, Harry's ruthless treatment of Scorpio leads to the killer being released -- and now he's determined to frame Harry as revenge. It's up to Harry to take the law into his own hands before Scorpio kills again.""Dirty Harry"" actually has a very simple story, loosely based on the Zodiac killings in the 1970s. The really memorable part of the movie is the presentation -- this was a cop story where innocents frequently die, the killer walks free sometimes, and the ""hero"" isn't particularly heroic. There's nothing romanticized or tidy about Dirty Harry's world.And a lot of that comes from Eastwood himself. His performance as Callahan is the stuff of cinematic legend -- he's an anti-hero with nerves like barbed wire and eyes like steel buttons, and he cares far more about justice than law. What matters most to him is saving innocent lives and stopping the killer, and sometimes he has to step outside the law to do so.And while Eastwood starts off as a simple cop protagonist, his presence grows more imposing as the story winds on. This isn't hurt by the demonstrations of his badassery -- such as threatening a robber with the legendary ""Do ya, punk? question"", then strolling off on a bloodied leg.Director Don Siegel gives the movie a gritty, slightly grimy feel, with Callahan drifting through sleazy strip clubs, abandoned rock quarries and the occasional rooftop with a suicidal person clinging to it. And it has a strong feeling of realism, even during the more ""Hollywood"" scenes -- when Harry leaps off a bridge onto the roof of a schoolbus, it doesn't look like a stunt. It looks REAL.He also injects a note of shocking horror into some of the scenes, such as when Robinson's Scorpio begins crazily threatening children when they start freaking out. It's especially scary because we've seen innocent people killed by this maniac, so we know he's perfectly capable of hurting the children.""Dirty Harry"" became an instant classic for a reason -- not only does it introduce us to the gritty anti-hero cop, but it let the world know that Clint Eastwood was a legend.

1642372,"One of the biggest plot twists in the ""Wizard of Oz"" was discovering that the ""mystical"" and ""almighty"" Oz was nothing of the sort. When Dorothy and company finally meet him, the ""great"" Oz is just a goofy, kind hearted con man and talented illusionist. This new ""prequel"" introduces us further to the titular character and cleverly tells us the story of how this dodgy con artist becomes the wonderful Wizard of Oz. I thought James Franco was incredibly entertaining as the less-than-scrupulous illusionist who attempts to right all of his wrong-doings as the film progresses. While most of the residents of Oz belive his illusions are ""true"" magic, a handful of characters - his closest allies and enemies alike- know he is just an illusionist. In fact, the coolest aspect of the movie is seeing how a mere illusionist does battle with true spell-casters. He will require the help of a flying monkey in a bellboy suit, a fiesty china doll and Glenda, the good witch. All these characters, particularly the china doll, are really entertaining.It's also absolute eye candy. ""Oz"" is arguably one of the most colorful movies I've ever seen (right up there with Avatar and Speed Racer for its bold popping color pallette). Colors are lush and practically burst from the screen; the production value is jaw dropping- whether in the dark forest, or on the streets of Emerald City or the war-torn China Town. The mix of live action, animation and CGI is wonderfully realized, all while still maintaining the feel and charm reminiscent of the ""Wizard of Oz.""I've watched both movies back to back and they play wonderfully off one another. The new Oz prequel is actually a very well made movie that maintains the playfulness and energy of the 1939 film. It is a very fun, incredibly entertaining movie. It's fun to see how things are set up in this movie that will play out in ""The Wizard of Oz.""As for the negative reviews... It never ceases to amaze me just how ridiculous some of the film critics come across. Negative reviews aimed at this movie include: over acting and thinly developed characters. Interestingly, it can be easily argued that the ""Wizard of Oz"" is just as guilty of the exact same things. For instance, niether the Tin Man, The Scarcrow, Dorothy or Toto come across as ""deep"" characters. They are as thinly developed as any of the characters this prequel is charged with. And the over acting? Would anyone dare suggest that there was no over acting in the 1939 classic? It just seems a tad hypocritical to condemn one movie yet praise another while both share very similar attributes.Oh, and let's not forget the hordes of critics who condemned this movie because the iconic wicked witch's transformation didn't provide audiences with a slow, psychological descent into madness that is apparently appropriate for all villians to undego since the Dark Knight (ala the Joker or Bane). Again, where are all these psychologically ""tragic"" villians in other children's classics? The Ice Age films? Bed knobs and Broomsticks? the Herbie movies? How about Dumbo, Cars, Shrek, Mary Poppins, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin, the Muppets, or even The Wizard of Oz?Overall, Oz is a treat that pays respect to its predecessor and cleverly plays off it. Highly entertaining and absolute eye candy to boot. Don't listen to the critics on this one. Oz is a winner.",N/A

1338701,"Here are capsule impressions of selected episodes from season eight of ""The Virginian,"" another strong season, and the last in its original format.THE LONG RIDE HOME -- Guest stars, Leslie Nielsen, Lonny ChapmanYoung rover must decide whether to stick with his footloose partner or settle at Shiloh. Gritty yarn introduced Tim Matheson's likable Jim Horn character to the series. Nielsen stands out as usual as a rootless saddle bum. Snowy cattle drive scene is rarity for show commonly situated in a perpetually sunny studio Wyoming.A FLASH OF DARKNESS -- Guest stars, James Whitmore, Pamela McMylerSightless after a head injury, The Virginian is nursed by a horse thief's daughter. Depicting the terror and bewilderment of the newly blind pushes Drury well outside his comfort zone, but he delivers a tour de force, possibly his best work in the series' entire nine-year run. A restrained Whitmore and winsome McMyler also resonate. Music by Leonard Rosenman.THE POWER SEEKERS -- Guest stars, Barry Sullivan, Andrew Prine, Davey DavisonClay Grainger is deceived into entering an election race that soon becomes nasty. Astute scenario by Robert Van Scoyk turns a legislative contest in Wyoming territory into a microcosm of the lying, corruption, double-dealing and dirty tricks so ingrained in American politics. Sullivan does a masterful Abe Lincoln slouch as an aging lawmaker who's fed up and wants to quit.THE RUNAWAY -- Guest stars, Guy Stockwell, Peter Whitney, Jan Shepard, Johnnie WhitakerBoy abused by cruel custodian escapes to seek his father, who's the Medicine Bow town drunk. Future movie Tom Sawyer Whitaker gets a head start in this Twain-influenced tale. Treacly outcome is averted through a jarring late plot twist. Stockwell is excellent as the haggard, self-pitying soak. Composer Fred Steiner, best known for the ""Perry Mason"" theme, wrote the sympathetic score.A LOVE TO REMEMBER -- Guest stars, Diane Baker, Fred BeirThe Virginian's growing attachment to a woman from the East is marred by traumatic memories from her past, which resurface in Medicine Bow. Baker performs with stylish grace in romantic puzzle carefully assembled by director Joseph Pevney. Less serious-minded viewers may notice that while Drury is brooding over his rupturing love affair, McClure is having a barrel of fun: Trampas dates a trapeze performer, wins a sack race and spins a nonsensical whopper about a hoop snake.A TOUCH OF HANDS -- Guest stars, Belinda Montgomery, Michael ConstantineTrampas agrees to marry an eastern-educated girl despite her fanciful notions about ranch life. Realistic drama written by John Dunkel gives western mythology a sharp poke in the eye. McClure and John McIntire share a high comedy moment: Trampas has to ask Grainger for a loan but goes completely tongue-tied.JOURNEY TO SCATHELOCK -- Guest stars, Anne Helm, Burr DeBenningHorn chases a bitter saloon girl and her crony after they scam him out of Shiloh cash. Helm's richly detailed portrayal of the unhappy tart paints some color into routine story further lifted by a glorious tall-pine location shoot. Tame conclusion to this and many other season eight episodes reflected an ongoing NBC network anti-violence kick.NIGHTMARE -- Guest star, Joan CrawfordA widow struggles to keep her sanity after being accused of murder. Hollywood legend Crawford is up to her ears in trouble in this loaded melodrama, co-written by actress Bethel Leslie, that makes ""Mildred Pierce"" look like a cakewalk by comparison. Crawford's a bit long in the tooth for it, but watching her is like flipping through the last pages of a cherished family album.A KING'S RANSOM -- Guest stars, Patrick Macnee, Jackie DeShannonThree Aussie outlaws kidnap Grainger. Tattered script leaves plot gaps wide enough to drive cattle through. A waste of time for everyone, especially pop singer DeShannon in a nondescript acting fling.THE SINS OF THE FATHER -- Guest star, Robert LiptonMysterious gunman who rescued The Virginian from robbers hires on at Shiloh despite his obvious hatred of Grainger. Dandyish Lipton, brother of ""The Mod Squad"" star Peggy, scores as the fast draw with a hidden agenda. Cagey script wrings a nifty variation out of cliched showdown-at-sunset climax from Owen Wister's novel. Tim McIntire brings Falstaffian good cheer to his brief part as real-life gunslinger John Wesley Hardin.",The Virginian: Season 8

1590244,"From the moment I heard that Robert Pattinson, he of the sparkly vampires of TWILIGHT, had been cast as the lead in David Cronenberg's adaptation of Don Delillo's COSMOPOLIS, I knew immediately that this would be a polarizing film, and judging by the critical response and the response here, it certainly lived up to that expectation. What I didn't expect, though, is that R-Patz would be so compelling in this film, and that the film itself would be more of a return to Cronenberg's earlier career before he started making more &#34;Oscar-Caliber&#34; films like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, EASTERN PROMISES and A DANGEROUS METHOD. COSMOPOLIS is a film that reminded me of the hallucinatory semi-futurist setting of his classic VIDEODROME, in which the hybridization of humans and technology worked to create a revolution. Here, as we follow young multi-billionaire Eric Packer (Pattinson) in his ultra-high-tech limo through the streets of New York on his way across town to get a haircut, we see not a physical transformation, but rather a mental and almost spiritual transformation as his odyssey through the streets and the people lead toward a finale of inevitability.Packer is betting his fortune against the Chinese form of currency falling, but it's not happening yet, and he is losing millions. He also is informed by his security detail that there is a potential threat on his life. But this is all just dressing for the meat of the film, which are the several liasons with different people he has throughout the day in his limo on his trek across town. He meets with his tech guru (Jay Baruschel), a seemingly teenaged currency genius (Philip Nozuka), a sexual liason with a beautiful woman (Juliette Binoche), a daily visit from a doctor which leads to a hilarious and uncomforable scene between himself and another underling (Emily Hampshire), a discussion with a technological futurist (Samantha Morton), and more as he continually meets with his new and very wealthy bride (Sarah Gadon) to share a meal with her. All of this continues pressing on throughout a sometimes clean and shiny streetscape and a sometimes frightening hellscape as anti-capitalist protesters run amok in the streets, and it's likely that one of them could be the threat against Packer's life. More sex and shocking violence occurs as the night comes to a close, and Packer finds himself face to face with his real assassin, played by Paul Giamatti.What's so striking about this film is also the reason that people looking for an old-fashioned entertaining night of watching a film will be disappointed, and that is the monologues and one-on-one dialogue exchanges throughout the film, primarily taking place in Packer's limo. The film has a great deal to say about society, technology, nature, and humanity, but none of it is set or said in a particularly realistic fashion. The hyper-stylized dialogue is like honey in your ears as it constantly flows, and the performances are compelling, dark and stripped-down in a way that only an independent film can do AND make work. Pattinson is quite good as Packer, a young man who seems like he's already lived most of his life and accomplished most of his goals. Part of what is so fascinating about Packer is how lifeless he seems, even when he's living on the edge of reason. He takes what he wants when he wants it without any thought or care about the consequences. Even his own psyche is as sterile and as ordered as the interior of his limo, until he leaves it, which is when he begins to crack. Most of the other actors who populate the film are passers-by, who are not whole characters but rather reflections or representations of parts of his mind, but that doesn't diminish their presence. Standing out here, though, is Giamatti as the crazed funhouse mirror of Packer, who has focused every element of his life into killing Packer. His performance here is almost self-parody of a sort. Giamatti takes his typical sad-sack self and amplifies it to manic levels.It's likely that many of the people renting this film without knowing what it's about and solely for the purpose of watching Robert Pattinson in something have been and are going to be sorely disappointed with, since they won't know what they're getting themselves into, but fans of David Cronenberg and his films and Cronenberg's mission statement that has permeated almost all of his films will not find themselves disappointed with COSMOPOLIS.

1604348,"This is a completely engaging film.  Two extremely capable actors (Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul) play the lead roles and catch you up in their story.  This film is (unfortunately) funny when Winstead and Paul are drunk.  They have such good times together because of their mutual interest in alcohol.  Winstead plays a first grade teacher who eventually realizes she needs to stop drinking after a number of incidents, one which includes throwing up in front of the whole class after a night of drinking.  Although she goes to AA for help, her husband played by Aaron Paul does not.  Their marriage can't handle such a drastic change in personal dynamics and they separate.  She has a relapse (but I understand that happens in almost every case) and gets sober again.  The movie ends on such a hopeful note without spoon-feeding you an answer.

1486410,"The 411 by Maria:In it's most basic form the movie is about Pi Patel, the only human survivor after his parents commission a ship to move their zoo from India to Canada. Along with Pi is an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra that broke it's leg when it feel into the life boat and an adult Bengal Tiger (who is named Richard Parker).After the other animals are killed by tiger, Pi and the Tiger learn to coexist on and off the life boat until Pi is rescued in Mexico 227 days after the ship went down.OK...now that I gave you that very brief summary, let's get into how and why I liked it so much. The movie is exquisitely done with amazing cinematography and CGI effects. I truly love how beautiful it was and wish I had seen it in 3D!Pi played by Suraj Sharma as the shipwrecked younger Pi and later Irrfan Khan as older Pi, is amazingly resourceful as he struggles to keep himself and Richard Parker alive.My husband says it reminded him of Tom Hanks Castaway, I can see why he would say that but visually, it is way above Castaway.Very cool effects!",N/A

1665127,"It's not often that a movie outright pisses me off.  I see a lot of bottom-of-the-barrel movies for some odd reason, but very few of them make me outright angry for watching them.Nothing Left To Fear made me angry.  I think the biggest reason why is the movie actually starts off well, has likable characters (at first), establishes a good Christian community (at first), looks good and has decent actors.  If the film actually made better use of the people in the main family and continued with being a Christian horror film, it probably could have been good.The problems start when Rebecca (one of the two not-so-teenage daughters) starts having weird dreams.  There turns out to be no reason for her to have these dreams except for perhaps plot convenience and cheap foreshadowing.Second, the story centers around a ritual the town has to perform every once in a while (annually?  bi-annually?  whenever Clancy Brown gets bad vibes?  who knows).  This wouldn't be a bad thing if it ever became clear what the details of the ritual were.  In a good horror story like the video game Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly, the details are very clear: One twin sister has to kill the other twin to appease the god of the village and to keep it from coming out and killing everyone.  Simple, scary and to the point, right?Here, there never seems to be any clear reasoning behind the ritual, except that it's ""God's will.""  Moreover, the ritual is centered around which family member eats a piece of cake with a demon tooth in it.  I wish I were making that up.  Anyway, so the person who eats the tooth-cake (Rebecca's sister Mary) is the chosen one for the ritual, and is subjected to being impregnated by a demon residing in a well.  After a bit of time, the possessed family member then has to go around killing all the non cake-eating members of the family, except for one remaining member, whose blood is then used in the same well to draw the demon back into it for another period of time.  I'm not sure if it matters which family member lives or not, but if it did, the movie never addresses it. Actually, what would have happened if one of the family members turned out to be adopted?  Would the ritual have failed miserably then?As soon as the hell starts breaking loose in the film, the two most likable characters in the family are immediately killed off in unspectacular fashion.  Soon after, the audience is treated to Rebecca abandoning her kid brother Christopher to her demon sister, basically leaving him to die.  In the next scene, she is not seen as distraught, or even concerned, about her brother being in danger.  This scene is particularly horrible because Christopher was the smart one begging Rebecca and her boyfriend to not stand and argue outside the car while a homicidal demon is approaching, and instead do the smart thing and drive far, far away from the demon.So yes, after this scene Rebecca becomes incredibly hateable, and that's bad news because of course she's the main character.  So when it gets to that, what's the point of even caring anymore?  The ending of the movie plays in predictable fashion and the final scene shows the cycle of the ritual will continue; in fact, it's basically a repeat of a similar scene shown earlier in the film.  So there's no good payoff, no lessons learned, and no point to watching Nothing Left to Fear.",N/A

12437,"A surprise highlight in my viewing pleasure last night.  Demi Moore's character is friends with a woman who's husband (Bruce Willis) plays a rather convincing abusive JERK!  He's every woman's worst nightmare- he flirts with other women, abuses his wife, bad mouths everyone in sight, never hesitates to make a scene, has a seriously bad attitude, swears uncontrollably, etc.We learn quickly how much of a scumbag he is right in the very beginning when we see the wedding taking place between Bruce's character and his wife, and Bruce demands that she walk over to her father and grab her pocketbook (for whatever reason).  She has to do what he says or suffer the consequences.  A really pathetic human being.  For the sake of a movie, I like him WAY more in this role than what he's been doing the last 10 years (a combination of comedy and action that flat out stinks if you ask me) but that's a subject for another time.This movie focuses on Demi Moore's version of what happens the night Bruce is murdered.  Demi's character is questioned by the cops by sitting at a desk and telling her story the entire time.  The questions are really smart and accurate with believable acting by everyone involved.  Is she telling the truth?  Without spoiling what happens, while Demi, her friend and Bruce are all out having fun at a carnival, something awful happens that results in Bruce being murdered so Demi and her friend have to find clever ways of covering their tracks and hiding the evidence.  This is actually a really well-told storyline and I'm surprised how good it is.  I wasn't expecting much.  The touch of blood on the clothing seems rather realistic to me.I really can't reveal anything more without spoiling the entire movie, but be prepared for a surprise ending.  Never been a fan of Demi Moore, but her performance here leaves me completely satisfied.  Some might not like the ending since it's not what I expected at least, but it's better than the typical conclusion that seemed inevitable much earlier.  Glad the writers took it in another, fresher direction.",N/A

The difference is these guys were more entertaining than the films. and the films? should never have been allowed to see the light of day. now in Rifftraz they're back and in this episode they take on the Grande Dame of apocalyptically bad movies.

Beyond the dumb plot the fact the aliens seem too stupid to know which end of a gun to hold, a policemen with a horrific tendency to use his gun as a casual pointer and dialogue like ""You stupid, stupid human"" this would have been all set for riffing from Wood's bad direction and cheap production values. He has set that are made of cardboard and continuity is non-existent- for example in a chase scene you see a woman running at night, then a car driving by day, then a monster by night etc. The biggest flop is the fact Bella Lugosi who died half way through the film was replaced by the chiropractor of Wood's wife.  a man who looks nothing Lugosi. I thought the famous actor would disappear part way through but no. he was in all the outside scenes but none of the inside scenes. so you see Lugosi sneak into a house- the chiropractor running around inside the house-and then Lugosi runs OUT of the house.All of this would be rife for any of us to go after but in the hands of the MST3K gang it is a true work of art.In the end if you loved MST3K or just  want to see a truly horrible movie get the treatment it deserves, grab this, you won't live to regret it!",RiffTrax: Plan 9 From Outer Space - from the stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000!

Don't look for accuracy, though, just a romanticized tale that ignores the James brothers' past as Civil War guerillas and blames their turn to crime on the railroad. Another thing the film is famous, or infamous, for is the killing of a horse during a scene where Frank and Jesse pursued by a possee have to force their horses off a 70-foot bluff into a river (played by the Lake of the Ozarks).

251423,"When I first saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, it was like an epiphany. While the combination of live action and animation was and still is remarkable (and astonishingly great considering that the effects were all optical and pre-digital), what resounded with me was the cartoon characters cameos and the grand assemblage of them all together (I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it).I and many fellow animation enthusiasts felt vindicated for all those years of what some termed ""baby stuff."" Animation was hip, cartoons were now cool and Steven Spielberg was buying cels. Roger Rabbit the film became a benchmark for animation for every age, especially adults who grew up with it and wanted to see it aimed at them.Thus came The Simpsons and copycats that imitated both Roger and Homer. There were cartoons for kids, cartoons for grownups and a new ""golden age"" at Disney, where now-classics like Beauty and the Beast delighted everyone. Many of the artists -- and there were TONS of them -- cut their teeth on the huge international effort that went into producing Who Framed Roger Rabbit and went on to greater successes on their own.So how does it look now? Gorgeous on Blu-ray, particularly the Toontown sequence, but also even the darker scenes take on a luster and sheen because every detail is defined. It holds up quite well, not as shockingly adult as it seemed to parents back in 1988, as compared to today, with far more racy scenes and strong language more prevalent in mainstream media, even ""family"" films and TV.It seems likely that many of the cartoon characters who pop up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit may become more and more obscure, sadly, except to animation and Disney buffs. Several generations have missed out on regular TV viewings of classic cartoons, so the character cameos do not all have the impact they had back in '88. It's like watching Around the World in 80 Days today with people who are only familiar with the here and now. They may not know David Niven, much less Cantinflas, and the star-studded parade they encountered in what was a sensation in its day.WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT BONUS COMPARISONSThe new Who Framed Roger Rabbit package includes bonus features from the 2003 Vista Series release, but mostly on the Blu Blu-ray disc.

But I was extremely impressed with Zac's character as the detached war survivor. This is the first role that I've seen him play someone sooo serious!!! He didn't smile that much in the movie and for some reason I don't think that reflects who Zac is as a person at all. He really did play the hell out of this part!The movie itself was made up of a lot of romance, some drama and a few pinches of life lessons all mixed in one. I really enjoyed the scenery, the characters and the roles they played and much of the music. It all tied together quite well. I especially loved the fact that Zac's character wound up at a place that takes care of and trains dogs. That was really special to me as they are my favorite pet ever!I know I haven't said all that much about the movie specifically (I really don't like those reviews that spoil the whole thing for you!) but like I've said before I'm like 5x better at writing reviews for music.Overall, this is probably the best movie I've seen all year! So definitely take into consideration that this review in no way, shape or form does this beautiful movie justice. After watching it I think this movie is rated PG-13; there is some swearing and very minor nudity (Zac's butt is shown in the nude for like 3 seconds) but other than that it's a pretty clean movie.

931490,"On a par with Aimee & Jaguar, Night Is Falling, and even Desert Hearts, this solid, well-made film features great performances, nice lighting, well-though-out sound, and overall it's very nicely directed.  The script is also quite appealing, and I admire the chutzpah of having characters slip effortlessly between English and (subtitled) Mandarin.  In the very spare commentary, though, writer/director Alice Wu keeps describing the film as a romantic COMEDY, but while it's very romantic, it's really not all that funny.  It's certainly light, and there are a few mild chuckles to be found, but if this was supposed to be an actual comedy, it's failed on that one point.  But the relationships feel credible, the cast is quite talented, and the cinematography is exceptional - especially for such a small budget and short schedule (27 days).  The only quibble with the overall look of the film is that like a lot of modestly-budgeted indies, it's a bit claustrophobic in that there are very few exteriors.  We're in a hospital but we never see the outside of it, we're in a restaurant (the same one several times - a joke that fails) but we never see the outside of it, we don't see the outside of the grandparents' house or Vivian's apartment and we only get a brief glimpse of the outside of Wil's place.  We're outdoors for a couple of scenes in a park but they're also very constricted, and even a couple of night exteriors feel like a back-lot, though they were actually shot on the street in NYC.  But these are minor issues; it's a warm, pleasant romance with a handsome cast, well-produced and directed and with a lot of heart, and it's a welcome addition to the painfully small canon of lesbian-themed films.",N/A

Capone who was supposedly afraid of needles need not die from syphilis. one must also wonder if Dillinger was actually killed in front of the theater. melvin purvis never lived that one down and died in disgrace. hoover wanted Dillinger alive because he believed Dillinger had information on much of the corruption in the various police forces.,Dillinger And Capone

260238,"Still photographer Bert Stern is perhaps best known for Smirnoff ads, Marilyn Monroe nude shots and the iconic poster from Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film, ""Lolita.""  This his one and only movie, co-directed by Aram Avakian, has landed a place in the National Film Registery.  In 1958, the Newport Jazz Festival was still in its infancy and coincided with the trials for The Americas Cup sailing race.Stern had thought about making a traditional film but gave up early on for lack of a story.  Instead he turned to a documentary featuring the musicians, but perhaps more importantly, the audience.  He presents full length songs performed by the best known musicians at the time all in Dolby Digital 5.1.  Mostly jazz but interestingly enough, two non-jazz greats make perhaps the biggest impact.  More on than in a minute.What makes this film more than a straight music concert or a traditional documentary with bits and pieces of music is how Stern and his editor weave back and forth between the performers and the audience.  The audience is always in synch with the right song, even flubbing the lyrics as we are all prone to do.  The audience is mostly wealthy white people but there is a large contingent of black folk sprinkled throughout the flock.  All seems good with the world.  While it's pre-Civil Rights 1958, its Rhode Island not Alabama.The music is excellent but it was a bit shocking to see a youngish Chuck Berry duckwalking across the stage singing ""Sweet Little 16"" in front of a traditional jazz band, all of whom were smiling with surprise.  Even though a couple audience members seemed befuddled, most were having a great time, especially the younger members in the crowd.  Rock `n roll was here to stay.The other surprise was the great gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who like Berry was a little out of place, but brought the house down with a trio of songs to end the show.  This little movie is a gem.Here is a list of performers:Jimmy Giuffre 3: Jimmy Giuffre, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim HallThelonious Monk Trio: Thelonious Monk, Henry Grimes, Roy HaynesSonny Stitt and Sal SalvadorAnita O'DayGeorge ShearingDinah WashingtonGerry Mulligan Quartet with Art FarmerBig MaybelleChuck BerryChico Hamilton QuintetLouis Armstrong and his All-Stars: Trummy Young, Danny Barcelona, and Jack TeagardenMahalia Jackson",Jazz on a Summer's Day VHS

1017304,"When this show first aired, I caught only a few episodes, having been otherwise occupied on the nights it played. I remembered it as being stirring and since I had become a recent devotee of the amazing NBC series Parenthood, another Jason Ritter vehicle, I thought I'd rewatch the entire series of Joan of Arcadia, which comprises just two seasons. (I've been a full-fledged long-time fan of many of the shows the other Parenthood actors were in, including Gilmore Girls, Coach, and Everybody Loves Raymond, so I thought I'd check out Ritter's other work, too.)To my relief, I found Joan of Arcadia to be one of the most--if not the most--thought-provoking, well-acted, well-thought-through series ever. It touched on so many profound topics, such as life and death, disability and ability, good and evil, and, of course, believing and nonbelieving, and it was done in such a way as to always be entertaining and oftentimes funny.It is basically about an ordinary teenage girl, Joan, played by Amber Tamblyn, who has recently moved to the fictional town of Arcadia with her family, dad Joe Mantegna, a police chief/detective; mom Mary Steenburgen, who starts out as a secretary at Joan's school and then becomes the art teacher (she also becomes more spiritual throughout the series, which leads to some interesting revelations); older brother Jason Ritter, a paraplegic who used to be a high school jock; and younger brother Michael Welch, who is a math and science prodigy and to whom Joan often comes for possible scientific explanations for her encounters with God. Throughout the series, Joan never fully reveals her connection to God--when she alludes to it, she quickly dismisses it in order to fit in. I think a full revelation was upcoming in season 3, as Joan was about to do battle with the character portraying evil and as her mother's newfound spiritual connection progressed.Amber Tamblyn is amazing--probably the best young actress of her time (why isn't she in more series or movies?), as are her back-ups, especially Mary Steenburgen. But all the actors portray their characters extremely well and are equally believable. Joan is an average teenager, not one with a special gift, until the God characters approach her to, first, do His work in small ways and then, at the end of season two, to challenge evil.I can't say enough good stuff about this show. It is a travesty that it didn't survive past two seasons. This is definitely one that was killed off before its time. It deserved a third season, which, with the final episode of season two, was ramping up to be incredible. What a godawful shame that that season never came to fruition. Shame on you, CBS, for cancelling what is one of the most compelling series dealing with one of the most mature subject matters on television.",Joan of Arcadia - The Second Season

1608110,"This was an interesting movie about an individual trying to balance his spirituality with his sexuality, while enduring a very debilitating and life-threatening physical condition. I thought all of the characters were placed in situations that for many people would be uncomfortable. Helen Hunt's character is still a puzzle to me and I have to wonder if she took the role just so she could show off a fabulous physique at age 49. Fundamentally I think the movie was well directed, shot, etc., but I just didn't care for the story in general. Somehow I felt like I was intruding in very private--well--sessions and breaching a therapeutic and spiritual confidentiality. I didn't think Helen Hunt's performance rose to the level of an Academy Award nomination, but then I'm a Midwesterner with different expectations of actors than my coastal friends.

I bought it only because of the sale, never having seen an episode of the show.  Great writing mixes humor with serious murder cases. All of the actors are good, in every role, with Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic carrying most of the acting and comic load. The Father-daughter relationship between Rick and Alexis Castle is very well played.  It is nice to see a sweet, nice young girl (Molly Quinn as Alexis Castle), instead of the usual bad girls the networks like to present. You can't help but like the episode when Alexis goes to the prom. I like the fact that, through this season at least, there is no overt love relationship between Rick Castle and Kate Beckett, but a slowly growing respect for the detective abilities of each, particularly when they work together. The supporting characters are uniformly excellent.  This is a really good show.",Castle: Season 1

1489623,"Very rightly, other folks have advised that WWZ is NOT a straight adaptation of Max Brooks' entertaining 'hisorty' of the zombie war. I prefer to describe the film as ""inspired by the book of the same name."" We are dropped into the home life of Brad Pitt & Merielle Enos adn their two young daughters with no explanation or context. Just what we can pick up from the TV and radio chatter heard in the background. Very, very quickly, everything goes--as a friend from the UK likes to say--pear-shaped. Again, without warning or explanation. This is the film's chief virtue. For as long as possible, director Marc Forster keeps his audience off-balance...and frightened. This are not the zombies of George Romero or Robert Kirkman. This is a worldwide pandemic that is moving far too fast. As Pitt's character, Gerry Lane, takes his worldwide investigation (as a UN consultant) to Israel, the story starts to falter. An attack is instigated for the seemingly sole reason of getting Gerry OUT of Israel and into an airplane and onto his final stop. This attack is completely aviodable. By this point in the film, what attracts the infected to the healthy (loud noise and activity) is well-known. Yet, a celebration (amplified with HUGE speakers!!) is allowed to occur NEAR the giant wall built to keep the undead out. GUESS what happens?!? Once on the plane, we are treated to one more thrilling fright before arriving in Wales for this film's resolution. It is well-known that the ending was reshot and delayed release of the film. It is the weakest section of the picture. Pitt's voice-over narration as the film concludes leaves the door open for a sequel. As WWZ turned out to be a financial success, the sequel is possible. I can't see it being more than a 'bug hunt' (sorry, Pvt. Hudson). Certainly a different kind of action film. I watched WWZ alone and then again with my wife and a third time with a friend. It was fun to watch the shock of others and I wasn't bored. The holes become obvious, though. The BD looked and sounded great on my 57"" DLP screen and 7.2 surround system.

""Miracles"" had thoughtful writing, solid acting (gotta love the Skeeter!) and the beginnings of an intricate story line involving a Miracle-busting Paul Callan (Skeet Ulrich) who works for the Catholic church investigating purported signs of Godly presence. Weave in a great role for Hector Elizondo and you have all the makings of an innovative, original drama--just the kind of offering ABC was itchin' to dump. So, when the head program guy at ABC caught his own reflection in the mirror, he apparently became too distracted to restore ""Miracles"" to a decent, consistent time slot after the network was done with its ratings darling of the week--its news coverage of ""shock and awe"" in Iraq.""Miracles"" is one of the reasons viewers should NEVER watch network TV shows until they've been on at least three years. DON'T make an emotional commitment to a show if the networks aren't willing to do the same. Once a show's been on for three years, you'll at least be able to view a decent number of episodes via DVD, downloading, NetFlix, etc. In the short term, yes, this will cause more good shows to get cancelled while the broadcast networks learn their lesson (and remember, they're VERY slow learners). Over time, however, ABC (and, to a lesser extent, CBS, NBC and FOX) will learn American viewers aren't going to get attached to good quality dramas knowing they may get axed in favor of the next ""America's Got X-Factors Dancing With the Survivors"" knockoff. And maybe that'll make them not jerk around with their schedules so much that they preclude great shows like ""Miracles"" from developing a regular weekly following (remember, ""Cheers"" had horrendous ratings its first year, but NBC stuck with it and it became one of the most beloved, and popular shows of all time--not to mention spawning an excellent spinoff with ""Frazier""). Or, maybe it'll just drive us to watch more shows on cable networks, which is where ""Miracles"" would have thrived if given half a chance...Remember, more frequently than not, ABC stands for ""Already Been Cancelled"". Make them stop! Or, for those few souls who actually had a chance to watch ""Miracles"", visualize a world where it's not ""ABC is Now Here""; it's ""ABC is Nowhere"".",Miracles - The Complete Series

There she meets Johnny(Patrick Swayze), the hotel dance instructor, who is as experienced as Baby is naive. Baby soon becomes Johnny's pupil in dance and love.As with GREASE (1978) and FOOTLOOSE (1984) before it, DIRTY DANCING was a cultural phenomenon that now plays more like camp. That very campiness, though, is part of its biggest charm & if the dancing in the movie doesn't seem particularly ""dirty"" by today's standards--or 1987's--it does take place in an era (the early '60s) when it would have.Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey, daughter of ageless hoofer Joel Grey) has been vacationing in the Catskills with her family for many years. Uneventfully. One summer, she falls under the sway (as it were) of dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Baby is a pampered pup, but Johnny is a man of the world. Baby's father, Jake Houseman(Law and Order's Jerry Orbach), can't see the basic decency in greaser Johnny that she can. It should come as no surprise to find that Baby, who can be as immature as her name, learns more about love and life--and dancing--from free-spirited Johnny than traditionalist Jake.DIRTY DANCING spawned two successful soundtracks, a short-lived TV series on CBS, and a stage musical.It may be predictable, but Grey and Swayze have chemistry, charisma, and all the right moves. It's a sometimes silly movie with occasionally mind-boggling dialogue--""No one puts Baby in a corner!""--that nonetheless carries an underlying message about tolerance and is filled with the kind of exuberant spirit that's hard for even the most cynical to resist.

Not only because we don't really know what is going on, but also because the way in which the action scene is presented is too frenetic and it's hard to even see who is who in many instances and determine what is actually happening.I like action movies, but it annoys me when in an effort to make the action super high pace, the directors go over the top and we end up with meaningless sequences of events. Luckily for this film, once those initial moments pass, things get better. There is actually an interesting plot in place, with Bond suffering from the loss of  loved one and walking the thin line between going rogue and doing his job. As usual, there is suspense and intrigue, mixed with action and romance.This film is definitely not boring, but it is lacking some of those distinctive traits I have come to love in Bond movies, such as the off the cuff humor. Overall I was entertained, but it it not a Bond movie that will come to mind if someone has never watch a film with this character and asks me for advice on which one to try.",N/A

Instead of seventeenth century trappings,this is entirely contemporary - with solemn bodyguards, papparazza-on-staff, and a booziness that brings the Gatsby era to mind.A few details work in surprising ways. A woman takes the role of Conrad, and completely reworks the character in the process. Fillion's Dogberry approaches the level set by Michael Keaton inBranagh'sstar-studded version. And, in touchstone moments, the conversations that Benedick and especially Beatrice ""overhear"" have all the comic quality of any rendering I've seen, and better than many.

195190,"I just watched this film and found it to be very good and, for sure, worth watching.The interviewer does a very good job interviewing professors and university students with polite but pointed questions to show that there really is no observable evidence to support the claims of evolution.  Even the professors are not able to provide observable evidence that one kind of organism can evolve into a different kind of organism, as an example, a dinosaur into a bird.  One has to conclude after watching the many interviews that the interviewees really do not have any scientific evidence but really only have a belief system.Also, the movie reveals the stark reality of evolution that it leads to a devaluing of life, particularly human life.  The viewer will be amazed and alarmed, I hope, at the answer to the question posed to many of the participants, ""If you were given a choice of saving your drowning dog or cat or a neighbour, which would you save first?""

The main event, &#34;The Rise of Miss Power&#34;, is a great mini-movie.  Many of the stories main villains show up, along with cameos for almost every less common villain (Yay Learnerer!).

Django is freed and then starts to work with a German bounty hunter, who is a wonderful character. When they go to Candie Land, a plantation where Django's wife is being kept, that's where the movie just fell apart for me. Leo DiCaprio is Candie, and he turns in a good performance, but there's a lot of repetitive dialogue and plodding revelations. Django allows a slave to be torn apart by dogs, which made him an unsympathetic character, whereas before that moment, he was pretty cool. Yes, there's a lot of blood - lots of juicy gun fights. Some of it is way over the top, but that's what you expect out of a Tarantino film, so I have no objection to that. The movie is very long and would have been much better about half an hour shorter, but if felt as if Tarantino lost his way and was trying hard to insert tension in the middle, and for me, it just didn't work.",Django Unchained

1614474,"Having read most of these reviews, I'd like to mention some aspects of the film no one else did. The mad Russian scientist was only vaguely Russian, but that's ok. Like any good mad scientist, he loved his creations. ""You are so beautiful"" he effuses right before the Mega Queen spears him through and through. He doesn't seem to mind this, since he is so happy his experiments came to a successful end. Pretty amusing. Also, I thought there were two daughters, one of whom gets eaten in the worst possible way. No one mentioned her after, not least her parents, or any of you reviewers.  I thought that was odd. Anyway, sometimes the spiders would grow too big as they did what they do. A three foot tall spider doesn't become 6 feet tall just because it jumps on some hapless guy. We also have the incredible shrinking and the later gets bigger again Queen spider. Not good. What about the fact that the spiders were crossed with alien DNA? This would have been good to explore, but no one ever mentions it again. Since the aliens were found on a crashed spacecraft, maybe they weren't that smart after all, so their intelligence had no effect on the spiders. I dunno. On the plus side, the affection of the Mad Scientist for the spiders is almost touching. Also, the acting was ok, except for the younger daughter, who was pretty good. Too bad though that at certain moments she seemed almost casual about trying to evades angry arachnids. As I said, the film is uneven. I loved the tap-tippet-tap of little and not so little spider feet, and I'm willing to overlook the fact that spiders don't have queens. It wasn't that gory, which I liked since I'm sick of all these 'Saw' wannabe flicks that are so nasty I have to stop the movie. (I guess I'm a bit of a wimp.) Good story, ,though, and good pacing. It's good that things started slowly and then sped up gradually. It made this flick different. CGI was good too. An uneven flick, but break out the popcorn and enjoy.

Fast Eddie struggles with his demons, while the battle for his soul between his profoundly intelligent, self loathing, and ultimately, self sacrificing girl, and his sleazy, exploitative manager rages.

1620171,"In ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" CIA agent Maya represents and channels the American subconscious desire to find and kill Osama bin Laden once and for all.  We know very little about Maya -- where she is from, what motivated her to join the CIA, and what her motivations are for doing anything really -- and what we do know does not form  a multi-dimensional character:  Maya is obsessed with finding and killing Osama bin Laden, and she's convinced she has to fight the world to get to him.  Early on in the manhunt she stumbles upon the name of bin Laden's courier, and without any proof or substantive evidence she thinks that this courier is the key to finding bin Laden.  She is ultimately vindicated, but in the process everyone around her thinks she's merely chasing a ghost and bending reality to suit her prejudice.Bigelow is a very subtle and courageous director.  She's not afraid of raising tough moral questions, and she's not afraid of testing the psychological and emotional limits of her audience.  The movie is intensely claustrophobic -- everything happens in small spaces -- so that when we are given wide angle shots we have to breathe with relief.  I suppose that close angle shots in tight narrow spaces is a hallmark of Bigelow's cinematography, but it also offers us an interior into Maya's mind -- as she must seclude herself away in Pakistan, away from friends and emotions.  There's not much violence in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" as the movie is mainly just talk and innuendo, but when it does happen it happens with great shock and effect:  the torturing of a detainee, terrorist bombings, the bullets that kill the three men in bin Laden's compound.  But the ultimate violence is inflicted by Maya on herself, as she drives herself and all those around her insane with her obsession.  The obsession becomes so integral to her identity that when she is able to stare the dead bin Laden in the face she doesn't know how to feel, and when she boards a plane by herself she doesn't know where to go, and breaks down in tears.  It's very clear from Bigelow's long close-up that these are not tears of joy -- these are real tears, tears that she had to bottle up all these years as her obsession consumed her.Like Maya herself, Bigelow is very meticulous and detail-oriented.  ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a very slow, nuanced film that most viewers will find boring and aloof.  But I think that ""Zero Dark Thirty's"" focus on telling the story as realistically as possible is its greatest strength.",N/A

670581,"""Rugrats"" is a favorite of mine from my childhood. Every now and then I watch re-runs on that popular block on TeenNick called ""The 90's Are All That."" First off, the way this DVD is put together is very dated. It's from 2001 and was released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of ""Rugrats."" The show is now 23 years old and the seasons have been released as Amazon exclusives. The season sets are too overpriced for me though but finding this DVD for a cheap price is all I need (and maybe a couple other compilations). I remember seeing all of these episodes on Nickelodeon back in the day. I especially liked that it had the Vacation special. You won't be seeing the original intro. Instead it's the intro from the later seasons and there are intervals in-between each episode talking about the next episode. I only wish they included more episodes, but you also get a bonus...the unaired pilot episode, which was a treat for me. You also get two dated but classic music videos that were shown on Nickelodeon back in the mid 90's along with short clips from other episodes that weren't included on this DVD. Definitely worth it if you just want a simple list of episodes of ""Rugrats"" just for nostalgic purposes.",N/A

These are rather faithful adaptations of the greatest Batman story of all time, &#34;The Dark Knight Returns, &#34; by the brilliant Frank Miller.When the chapters of this graphic novel were first released in 1986, readers everywhere in the country had their minds blown.  For the first time, the whole concept of Batman and the comic book universe he lives in was elevated to the level of actual literature.  Comic book elements important to the genre were still there, brutal fights, impossible gizmos, over-the-top dramatics - but all done in a fresh way that gave these elements new life in the context of the dark, futuristic world Miller created.As a big fan of the original work, I'm very pleased with these animations, especially since much of Miller's unique illustrative style is captured all throughout.Great story, very well done, and a worthy modern homage to Miller's masterpiece.

It is more focused on Batman as a man and other heroes like Robin, Super Women, Super Man, the Green Lantern and many others.This move has a mix of comedy which I've noticed is in every Lego movie. It has action, adventure, great actors and even a lifelong lesson - sometimes you can't do things all by yourself, you need help. There are some pretty cool structures and machines. All these structures are built out of Lego bricks so you can really build them yourself if you knew how!The adventure begins when Bruce Wayne wins the ""Man of the Year"" award. If you don't know who Bruce Wayne is, he is Batman undercover. Then, the Joker commits a crime and Batman and Robin have to capture him once again. As they are trying to achieve their goal, Superman helps him. Batman gets annoyed with Superman but, at the end they work together and call in all the superheroes to defeat the Joker! If you want to know what happens at the end you must watch the movie.What I love about this funny, action-packed film is how it shows the relationship between Robin and Batman as somewhat difficult. This isn't very good for a side-kick and a hero. At the end though, they become good friends. Also, it shows all the heros' powers like Superman's strength and Batman's throwing skills. The best part for me is how everything is made out of Legos. And, as in most Lego movies, there are cool animations, good actions and great voiceover actors.My favorite scene is when the bat cave gets destroyed. It's action packed and shows Joker's ""funny"" side with his strange humor and his pie bombs. Superman helps them. But, the Joker and his partner Lex, who is running for president and using Joker to win election, gets away. Would you like to know how he was able to defeat Superman's power? Get a copy of this wonderful film and find out!I recommend this film for ages 3 and up. There's really no violence or harsh language in this movie. ""Lego Batman the Movie"" is extremely kid-friendly. I give this movie 5 out 5 stars. You can find it on DVD everywhere now.Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

232950,"This version of the classic story of Mame hits many high notes and some clinkers,the biggest being Lucille Ball as Mamenot that she isn't ok in the part,but just not great.  You never get over it's Lucy on stage clearly too old for the part but she does ok..Her lack of singing skills shows through out even though she embody s the mood the skill is not there.Bea Arther as Vera is a gem to watch but so much get's lost in this movie musical version..If you have never seen or heard the show or seen Aunty Mame with Rosalind Russel you might find this Version great...The songs are great numbers and that's a plus and if your  a Lucy fan you may enjoy this.

This is largely the same cast that appeared on Broadway, in this hit drama. Humphery Bogart, making his first major movie role memorable as &#34;Duke Mantee&#34;, public enemy number #1, created the proper atmosphere of post WWI America, drifting towards another war, and the entire cast provides flawless performances.

This is a MUST-HAVE DVD for your holiday collection.One Magic Christmas regals the tale of Ginny Grainger, a mother of two children and wife of an out of work dreamer--all of whom are dealt a rough hand. On top of that, Ginny, the sole provider of the family, and her dismal outlook on Christmas truly trouble her family...all they want is for her to believe.Through a number of wonderful touching, real, moments and some interesting plot twists, this movie is a touching holiday tale that will pull at the heartstrings. The soft, tender moments...the realness in everything this family is dealt along with some Christmas magic pull you in and make you a believer in Santa Claus...and Christmas spirit.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a cinematic experience that will make you think, touch you, and make you feel the warmth and magic of the season.

When a former client leaves messages for help and Jack arrives too late to save him, he has to find out what&#8217;s going on and why.I had a difficult time following the first story as I couldn&#8217;t understand what was being said, both due to the accent as well as mumbling by the actors, especially at the end of sentences. Getting through the episode took energy as I tried to figure out what was going on and the thread that took them there. By the time I was able to better able to follow the dialog it was pretty far into the episode and I no longer cared to try. I couldn&#8217;t tell you if that episode was any good or not, only that it wasn&#8217;t a good experience for me and I couldn&#8217;t dredge up the energy to watch the second episode, which I understand from other reviews, is supposed to be better.What I can say is that while Jack drinks a lot, at least he&#8217;s not a bumbling, falling down drunk, which I was grateful for.So while I can&#8217;t give it higher marks because I didn&#8217;t enjoy watching it, neither can I give it lower marks just because I personally had trouble following the dialog and others wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have that same issue.",Jack Irish anglais

What makes this film work are the performers.  Both Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro are so likable and so talented that we sit patientlyt through the unwinding of the plot and rejoice with them at the end.  Fonda is charming and sparkling and still looks very good.  DeNiro has the rare ability of being very strong and very vulnerable.

1589001,"This is a  weaker film than the first -- a flashy but, especially through its long middle section, rather flaccid offering that would have benefited from a 30- or 40-minute edit.That said, it does right itself in the last 45 minutes -- in itself an unusual event for any off-course movie -- and winds up being bland, general-purpose fun in the same way I imagine water parks are fun on a hot day.I could quibble about the anonymous design of the action scenes (a template seen in far too many films lately), the writing -- moral considerations seem to have been doctored into a number of dialogs -- and overly glitzy production design. But my enduring caveat is that ""Into Darkness"" displays sadly little respect for the franchise's rich history.Granted, the first Abrams film didn't either, but it got away with it  more effectively owing to the alternate-timeline plot. Here, ""Star Trek"" seems little more than a framework and set of characters to be drawn upon at will, irrespective of events in the original series and the earlier films, and less ""reboot"" than reinvention.I can't expand upon this assertion without getting into spoilers, but, in the main, it comes down to the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the chief villain.He is less than effective. I don't blame the actor. Cumberbatch did his best with what he was given -- and he does have one especially resonant scene -- but he was badly miscast in this particular part and for the worst Hollywood sorts of reasons. He should have had weight, and he has none. I wasn't intimidated by his character. I wasn't even interested in him. Heck, I couldn't even identify him without the film telling me who he is.And I should have been able to do so. His first closeup should have been one of those moments where all Star Trek fans draw in their breath and hold it for a second or two.Then, at least, the film would have had one such moment.",Star Trek Into Darkness

1557769,"Evil Dead returns to its horror roots. The remake suffers from the lack of Raimi or Campbell's involvement. They are associated with this film but their personal stamp of approval doesn't seem to be on it. Raimi's influence doesn't show up and Campbell appears in the end credits. It's almost as if they were hired solely to promote the film. The good news is that it is very gory. The bad news is that they don't take it to the next level. This is not the cabin in the woods I was expecting. The Evil Dead was legendary as a horror film. I can still connect with the original or sequel (you don't see that camera work everyday). It's so much fun and scared the wits out of people in the 1980s (it was the #1 movie rented in more than one country for at least a year). It revolutionized the demonic POV shots that grab you. The remake is fairly loyal to the original storyline. It unfolds almost exactly the same way with different camera work and actors. Some of the best elements of the original are here (e.g. the perverted pencil and basement zombie) but they just seem inserted and not crucial to the plot.Ultimately the remake doesn't offer more story or character development and is much less memorable. It could have been amazing with Raimi's involvement. After all, he made some awesome movies on a low-budget and then became a big success in Hollywood so he has learned so much since the 1980s. Yet he handed the directorial reins over to Fede Alvarez. The teens show up in an isolated cabin before the dead come to life. My main complaints are the acting, props, story and CGI. The cast is mostly forgettable. The acting featured one atrocious scene that reminded me of The Ring. This actress in a blue screen was whispering while surrounded by zombies with the music blaring full-blast. The scene either didn't support her, she was in the wrong movie or she simply lacked direction. The prop for the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) was rather lame. I'm not sure many demonologists use red magic markers to write in an ancient, priceless manuscript when they want a spell on summoning the dead. The CGI hollows out this movie to the point where so much is happening that you can't connect with the characters or action. This Blu-ray has about 39 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary (Director Fede Alvarez, co-writer Rodo Sayagues, Jane Levy, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas). That is fairly light treatment for such an iconic horror franchise. I must admit the Blu-ray picture quality is good and the audio is very good.

332330,"All my life I heard about that great science fiction classic - 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I finally decided that it was time to give it a try. So, dragging my teenage son along with me I put the DVD in the player and gave it a watch.On the plus side, the movie is visually stunning with many great scenes of space and spaceships that still impress some forty years later! The soundtrack is quite interesting, with an interesting mix of classical pieces and vocal pieces that put you on the edge of your seat.On the minus side, the movie moves with a glacial slowness. By the time the intermission drifted around, my son was so bored that he got up and went to watch television. I stuck with it, and was rewarded with a second half that was worse that the first. In general the second half made me think of a bad acid trip, of the sort that interested 1960s viewers, but nobody afterward. And, to make matters worse, it was an acid trip in slow-motion.At the end of the movie, I felt terribly disappointed. I am a huge science fiction fan, and yet I found the movie to be ambiguous to the point of irrelevance, leaving me with no positive feelings whatsoever. So, let me just say that while the movie is visually stunning it is murderously slow and uninterestingly ambiguous. I feel like I wasted two good hours on this movie, and I will definitely not watch it again.",N/A

The main problem is the house has an occupant. A small grey mouse who does not care to give up his home. The mouse out smarts the two brothers and an exterminator at every turn.

535195,"In 40 years of being obsessed with movies I have NEVER been this obsessed with what I believe to bea premier masterpiece of modern cinema. Save your comparisons to Pulp Fiction, et.al. There is nocomparison. Period. Guy Ritchie has delivered a fun, intriguing, and very complex tale filled withsome of the most hilarious ""cartoon"" characters in recent memory. Mobsters, bookies, boxing promoters,gypsies, ex-KGB agents, diamond thieves, pawn brokers, a 400lb. ""getaway"" driver, corpse eating pigs,and ""the"" dog...did that about cover it?No morality play or modern day issues here, just jaw dropping hysteria. I've seen it 20 times and it justkeeps getting better. The critics can go to hell. And if you didn't like this movie you haven't seen itenough. If it didn't make sense, go back and watch it a second and third time. And rather than trying tocompare this work with Tarantino, etc. take some time to contrast the characters at work here. The mad logicof the ""unhinged"" Bricktop played by Alan Ford vs. the subtle cool of Turkish, played brilliantly by JasonStatham, a former real life street con(see opening scene in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""). Theruthless machinations of Boris the Blade vs. Bullet Tooth Tony's cold blooded efficiency. And of course BradPitt as the leader of a pack of roving gypsies is the highlight of the film.

578642,"Whether or not you end up liking this movie will partially depend on your threshold for campy humor. It seems like the people who rag on this movie have all betrayed the fact--somewhere in their review-- that Camp silliness annoys them to start with.  It will certainly help if you come into it with a love of all things Sixties and kitschy (Frankie and Annette movies, for starters).  If you like Rocky Horror and John Waters movies, then Chicklet and her shenanigans will doubtlessly tickle your funny bone.Lauren Ambrose (Six Feet Under) plays Chicklet--an obvious nod to the old Gidget movies with Sandra Dee. All she wants to do is learn how to surf and hang out with her mousy friend Berdine. The only problem is, seeing certain geometric shapes and patterns triggers Chicklet's latent ""split personality"" (including a dominatrix named Ann Bowman and a hilarious Safeway Checkout girl named--of all things--Tylene Carmichael Carmelle). As if that weren't enough, her friends keep dropping dead. Is Chicklet the murderer?It would have been easy enough to play this as broad comedy for easy laughs, but the directors wisely restrain the impulse to go overboard, keeping the actors on a (relatively) tight leash. The camerawork achieves genre authenticity--indeed, many scenes could be mistaken for an actual 1960's surf movie. Lauren Ambrose in the lead does a great job of ""playing it straight"", which only makes everything even funnier. In fact, the entire cast does a fine job of convincing you they think they're in a drama. Charles Bush as Captain Monica Stark does his best Eve Arden. And the ""Bettina Barnes"" character of a reclusive B-movie starlet is delightfully dippy and even manages some pathos in between the laughs.Highly enjoyable, absurd and sublime. I also give this film 5 stars for re-watchability. (Not only does it lend itself to repeat viewings, but it's a fun movie to show your friends or play at parties.",Psycho Beach Party

It is my favorite Dracula movie. Cushing does a great job in Horror of Dracula. I thought his performance was exceptional and a great Van Helsing. Lee's performance was iconic. My second favorite Dracula movie in this set is Dracula 1972 it is the final showdown between Lee and Cushing. I found the movie to be so cool because the seventies were very different from the late fifties when the first time Lee and Cushing did battle. There is something about the atmosphere in a new generation that makes you really enjoy this movie because you know a new generation is introduced to Lee and Cushing. It was a great movie and I thought Lee and Cushing were in top form. My next favorite was Dracula Has Risen From The Grave. It had a great opening and a fine effort by a supporting cast. Lee does great in it as always. Taste The Blood of Dracula was not in my top five favorite Lee Dracula movies but I don't think Lee ever gave a bad performance of Dracula. I think horror movie fans will love this set. If you are just starting to get into vampire movies. I recommend this set and get Dracula Prince of Darkness which also stars Christopher Lee as the Count.

It showed different kinds of 'weapons' that the alien had that surpassed our own weapons. It's storyline was about 'drugs' and that fact that these aliens knew how to expound on drugs by using 'humans'.

The classy story of the Grantham family and the parallel world of their servants will involve you, thrill you, make you cry, laugh, cringe, and repeatedly draw you back for more! If you are the kind of person who has time on their hands, any Downton Abbey disc should come with a disclaimer: Do NOT watch unless you want to get hopelessly addicted!Sure it's a wee bit soapy, and some scenes border on the melodramatic and the sentimental, but heck, who cares? That's the entire reason it succeeds; it's pure unadultered escapism entertainment. Well that and Downton Abbey's superb cast, led by the impeccableHugh Bonnevilleand the greatElizabeth McGovern, with the incomparableMaggie Smithgiving a fiery supporting lead, with Dan Stevens, Brendan Coyle, and Michelle Dockery rounding out the talented main cast, though the full cast is massive and all obscenely talented!Add to that excellent cinematography, rich costumes, beautiful sets and scenery, and authentic dialogue, and you have the makings of a fine show indeed. But when you add to THAT the brilliant human emotion, tangled relationships, colorful, sympathetic characters, wry humour, and a smart, fast-paced plot...you have the makings of near-perfection as only Masterpiece Theatre can make. This is Downton Abbey, and while it is not as epic as Game of Thrones, or as riveting as Breaking Bad or Person of Interest, Downton Abbey is like no other show on television. Your moods will rise and fall with the episodes and the fate of your favourite characters, be it Nurse O'Brien (who we all love to hate), or Edith Crawley (who we all hate to love) and every time you pop in the disc, you will be swept away for a wonderful evening of escapism to the lush mansion of Downton.Here's to much Downtonian delight in the future! 4.5 Stars!",N/A

304468,"This was the most unique PPV event that the WWF had put out at this point as the WWE has never had an event under circumstances like this again such as this being the only time that a PPV event (not UK only PPV) was held in the United Kingdom, the third largest crowd in WWF history with over 80,000 fans, the fact that the two main events were all babyfaces & no heels but more importantly this was the only time in which the Intercontinental title would be headlining the show on it's own.Legion Of Doom vs Money INC. It's ironic that these were the two top teams in the company at the time but yet this match was not for the tag team titles while we got quite the entrance from Hawk & Animal riding their motorcycles down the ramp. The Road Warriors had the power advantage from the start with various slams resorting Dibiase & IRS to use cheap tactics to get the momentum to switch. From there, they used the tag team strategy of isolating one of the Warriors in their corner before making one mistake that resulted in the hot tag being made for Animal to come in & clean house. This was a solid opening match that played to both teams strengths while this was also the last appearance of the Legion Of Doom in the WWF till early 1997.Nailz vs Virgil. Virgil came out throwing hands but Nailz was just imposing to the point where Virgil's offense wasn't mounting to much. Nothing worth seeing here as it was just a quick squash for Nailz with the bigger focus going towards his feud with the Big Bossman.Shawn Michaels vs Rick Martel. Speaking of unique settings, this was another unique feud as this was a rare heel vs heel match with the focal point of the match being Michaels' valet Sensational Sherri placing a stipulation that neither man could punch the other in the face. Both men traded wrestling holds in the early stances with Michaels getting some momentum on his side with offense like a dropkick with Martel returning the favor as well. Both men teased throwing a punch throughout the contest before tempers got the better of both men with Sherri being a factor as well. This is one of those matches that I am torn on as even though this was entertaining with both men being heels along with the aftermath comedy adding more to the match while the fact that the stipulation took away from what could've been an outstanding contest knowing what both men were made up especially when the match ended when it seemed to pick up.WWF Tag Team Champions The Natural Disasters vs Beverly Brothers. The Disasters had the power advantage & were able to stop the attacks on various occassions which resulted in the Beverlys to stall the outside & regroup. The Beverlys were able to get some momentum on their side by resorting to quick tags & speed to hold off either Typhoon or Earthquake along with double team moves. However the size & strength was able to become a factor in the outcome. This tag match really wasn't much but I'll give it some credit as it was a decent worked match that didn't overstay it's welcome which is more than what I was expecting going into it.Crush vs Repo Man. This was significant for the fact that those who know their wrestling history, these two were former tag team partners in Demolition with Repo Man actually being Smash of the group. Past that, this was similar to the Nailz/Virgil match in which it was a dominate performance by Crush to cool the crowd down for the next match.WWF Champion Randy Savage vs The Ultimate Warrior. The WrestleMania VII rematch here with a couple of twists adding to it as not only were both men babyfaces here but the added story was that Mr. Perfect (Ric Flair's personal executive) had claimed that one of these two men had bought his services. Both men started off with a hand shake that actually resulted into an intense exchange before the match got underway. Warrior had the power right off the bat with Savage changing his strategy of attack by resorting to using his combination of speed & power while coming off the top rope various times. Warrior was able to catch (literally at one point) Savage on a few occassions coming off the top including working over Savage's back with series of back breakers, suplexes & a bear hug while Savage worked on Warrior's neck. The turning point here was the appearances of Ric Flair & Mr. Perfect getting involved in the match with a steel chair being used as we saw what their REAL purpose was all along resulting in a finish that neither man wanted but lead to a show of respect between Savage & Warrior. Savage was the perfect opponent for Warrior as this didn't top their WrestleMania match but definitely was one of both men's best matches in their careers as they worked well together.The Undertaker vs Kamala. Speaking of entrances, Undertaker came out to the ring in a hearse with Paul Bearer leading the way. Taker was dominate from the get go bringing the fight to Kamala with a series of chops & clothesline while also pulling off what we know now as ""old school'. Kamala was able to get some offense in based off distractions from Kimchee & Harvey Wippleman before Taker was able to get a hold of them as well till the finish where the phrase ""you won the battle but not the war"" was the intention of Kamala only for Taker to win the psychological war. This was a short & sweet match but was more of a teaser to continue this feud leading to the first ever coffin match.Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart vs The British Bulldog. Bulldog came out to the ring with IBF Continental Boxing Champion Lennox Lewis carrying the Union Jack to the ring with the added drama being that Diana Hart (Bret's sister & Bulldog's wife) was at ringside. Both men started shoving early before Bulldog resorted his power by knocking Bret not only out of the ring but off the platform almost into the fans. From there, both men went hold for hold with a series of armbars & headlocks with a counter for a counter before Bret was able to stay on step ahead of Bulldog with one moment to point in Bret's crossbody not going as planned resulting in Bret almost blowing out his knee before grabbing a reverse bulldog headlock on the way down. Bret switched tactics by going from the head to the back to wear Bulldog out with sleeper holds, back breaker, side russian legsweep & even countering Bulldog's crucifix into a fallaway slam. Bulldog was able to gain momentum back with his power & delivering offense of his own such as a gorilla press, a suplex off the top rope & even his own running power slam. Both men started to feel the effects of the match as it were on as they kept kicking out from various moves such as a german suplex to Bret even pulling out a sharpshooter to no effect before it was one counter hold that gave the fans what they wanted in their hero's dream coming true. Even though this match had a few blown spots that Bret even acknowledged in his DVD set, this was a historic match as both men put on a wrestling clinic to the point where Vince McMahon pointed out ""we have seen every wrestling move"" with the aftermath of all three embracing with the crowd cheering non stop being quite the site to see. This was the match of the night for me as well as a highlight match for BOTH men.Overall, this wasn't the best SummerSlam from start to finish but there were various highlights such as the setting being very unique along with the two title matches being the highlights while some matches were solid to just short squash matches so for a good price, I'd recommend but if not I'd get the SummerSlam Volume One set as you get this event along with four other events.",N/A

1495734,"Can't say much about the details of the film since a good part of its impact lies in the twists and turns characteristic of the genre. Richard Gere is first rate in the part of the retired CIA agent brought back to find the killer of a United States Senator. The killing has the distinctive markings of the work of a Soviet hitman thought to have been dead for twenty years. Gere's character had killed the hitman. Teamed up with Gere is a young FBI agent who had never been in the field before but had made a study of the hitman's career. He  is the model idealistic university trained person who joined the service to serve the public interest. With the team formed, the remainder of the film is devoted to the search for the killer and the changing relationship between the older CIA agent and the younger FBI agent, emphasizing the attraction of the older man with no family to the family (wife and children) of the younger. Martin Sheen is solid as the old veteran head of the CIA with others giving solid supportingperformances. There is action but it is not a film dominated by it. The emphasis is on the personal and professional commitments and loyalties among the participants.

A wasted Character, a side note. It's really hard to take a Joel Schumacker movie serious, when you've got neon lights flashing all over the place. Plus Bane is in this movie, yeah he's reduced a mindless idiot. Running errands for poison Ivy, and Ahnold. as Mr. Freeze. Again it wouldn't be so bad, if alllllllll of his lines didn't have to with Ice puns. And that's all of his lines, ugggghhh. And we're treated to the dumbest moment in Batman's history when he show up to a social function. Yeah I guess all that talk about staying in the shadows, and being mysterious was just talk. Because much like the 60's t.v show, Batman and Robin go to social gatherings. WITH A BAT CREDIT CARD!!!!!!, are you kidding me. You don't give the most dangerous character in the JLA, and in the world A BAT CREDIT CARD. Oh and we're treated to Batgirl, yep Alicia Silverstone shows up as Alfred's niece . Yeah that's as much backstory as the movie gives too, meanwhile Alfred is dying. And surprise surprise surprise, he has THE EXACT SAME DISEASE THAT MR. FREEZE'S WIFE HAS, and only he has the cure. But he wants to freeze all of Gotham, to hold them hostage. In the immortal words of Chris O'donell, this movie's purpose was made to sell toys. That's it, even the actors new that there was no story here. There really is no plot here, as much as Batman Forever was a 60's episode on acid. This was that on steroids, The effects aren't too bad. But that's about it, I keep trying. And other than the keep Alfred alive storyline, The movie just wanders, first Barbra is a bad girl from England, just without the british accent. Then she finds her way into the Batcave, and ALFRED ANTICIPATED THIS AND HAD A COSTUME MADE JUST FOR HER. Yeah don't ask, her fight with Poison Ivy leaves alot to be desired, ending with Poison Ivy saying and I quote ""Curses"". Yeah, that sums up this movie. There is no, and I repeat No good or redeeming quality to this movie.",N/A

1590202,"Some movies invite  diatribe: "" a bitter, abusive, prolonged, discourse, festooned with eloquent, stinging criticsm""Just take a look at some of the other reviews, such as 'worst movie ever' . This is the second move with a great actor, Paul Giamatti, playing a pivotal role ( Barney's Version ) wherein we are ""entertained"" by not a single human soul in the story with a working moral compass. We ruthlessly exploit the world for staggering wealth and power?, with each character displaying in fine form their ""Self Totality, utterly without remorse of any kind"". We drink, we fornicate with whomever, and whatever female is in the scene,; we ruthlessly knock about, beat, kill, and destroy people & property on all sides, in an ever darkeningslide of humanity into nihilist ooze. ( nihilist: "" a viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and that existence is senseless and uselss; Oooze: ""to emit slowly, that which is often seen as faintly repellant"" In a word, the director left out a good long straining bowel movement ~ although he did favor us with a prolonged prostate examination.)The one saving grace of this film might be that this is a new kind of horror movie that you would take your fresh faced, naive young high school sweetheart to. But instead of the creature from the black lagoon causing her to shiver and lean towards you, offering you that golden opportunity to slip your arm over her shivering shoulders, as she asks her knight in shining armor,... "" Uh..have you got a clue yet what is going on here yet ?""

I just never thought he had real acting chops, it wasn't until I saw him in &#34;Up in the Air&#34; did I start to take notice. I truly feel Clooney should stick to dramatic roles and The Descendants is no exception. He is funny, naive, and completely charming as Matt King, a lawyer who's wife has been seriously hurt in a boating accident. Matt is not a hands-on kind of parent, his two young daugthers both have some emotional, behavorial problems and he must take the sole parent role when he gets news that his wife's condition is not improving. I also really liked Judy Greer in this film, she's so delightful and she has great chemistry with Clooney.

Give this film a try, Clooney received an Oscar nomination for this film and it's pretty obvious why. Enjoy!",The Descendants

1432963,"Every once in a while you hear about a movie for us horror fans that is so different and strangely put together that you can't believe that it would be any good. You can't imagine that the idea would make any sense. All the good ideas have been taken already right? Well, no... you'd be wrong. This movie lets us know that although Hollywood may be fresh out of ideas, independent cinema is just warming up with new and inventive ways to scare us and make us laugh, all at the same time.The Puppet Monster Massacre. Seventy minutes of great entertainment that has you begging for more, or at least a sequel by the time the end credits roll. But this is not the type of movie that is built to put out forty-five more parts to it. This is the old fashioned style flick that has everything you want wrapped up in its running time. A movie you'll watch more than once, wishing there were more, but glad there isn't at the same time. So what makes this an odd movie? Well... puppets. That's right. Ever wish that the Muppets would do a horror movie? If so, this is for you.The story is set in 1985. An evil scientist named Wagner and his pet penguin have created a monster in their old mansion. The more the monster eats, the more it grows. Wagner wants more food for his creation, So he sends letters out to four of the towns teenagers for their chance to win a million dollars by spending a night in the mansion. So far we already have references to House On Haunted Hill, Frankenstein, and strangely Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.Charlie Hawkins is one of the teens that gets a letter. He lives with his grandfather Jonathan, and tells him that he'll re-open the old dime store if he wins the money. He has a crush on a girl in town, Gwen, who also receives a letter, and tells charlie that they should go to the mansion together. Raimi Campbell (Who makes the movie in my opinion) is a human movie reel reference, also receives a letter along with tough guy Iggy, whose girlfriend Mona just happens to tag along.Everything is set up perfectly for a showdown between the teens, the evil doctor and his monster. To give away more plot would be ruining the film for you. Raimi will more than likely be your favorite character in the film, as his constant references to fright films is hilarious. And his tendency to be scared out of his wits by everything that moves (or not) keeps you laughing. One of the things I never thought I'd ever see (or ever think about seeing for that matter) is a topless Muppet (puppet?). Well, that's taken care of on several occasions by our sexy Mona, who has quite a steamy shower scene.And to top off the humor, we have some fart jokes. Damn, I love fart jokes! And they find good uses for them here on several accounts. The backgrounds of the film look like they came from a video game. While that may not bother anyone, there are times when it looks quite cheap (interiors of the mansion), and others where it looks fantastic (night time exteriors). I imagine some of the backgrounds are CGI as well. Most all of the blood are CGI effects, and as a whole the effects and backgrounds suit our puppet friends just fine.The extras included on this disc are two commentaries, one from the director, and one with both the director and assistant director. There are also two discarded monster designs for us to have a look at as well. If you're a horror movie buff, you need to get this film, just for the references alone. If you just want to have some fun watching a different type of horror film, this movie is your ticket out of the Hollywood doldrums, and into independent movie bliss. 8/10.",Puppet Monster Massacre

1668867,"Season six is as good as ever!  I'm looking forward to the next season.  I love this series.  It's hard, if not impossible, to find a series of excellent mysteries that involve the unsavory aspect of murder that doesn't degenerate into something rather sordid and even salacious or revel in that theme.  Murdock Mysteries, by today's standards is refreshingly devoid of sex scenes and foul language. I think in this respect, it reminds me very much of Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes.  There certainly is no lack of adult situations but they aren't prurient in nature.  It's very Victorian...as it should be considering it is set in the late 1800's.If you are new to the series, lucky you!  You have all six seasons to occupy yourself with while waiting for season seven!  I will be anxiously awaiting next season without that benefit...although I like to re-watch episodes from previous seasons.  There are only a handful of series that I enjoy enough to re-watch but this is definitely one of them.  (Seasons are available individually or in collection such asMurdoch Mysteries, Season One,Murdoch Mysteries Collection: Seasons 1-4; Blu-ray is also available.)In addition to the old-fashioned and polite etiquette, what makes this series special to me is the tongue-in-cheek references to inventors and their inventions, the famous, and even the notorious of the 20th century.  The genius Detective Murdock also invents and discovers many of the forensic tools available today to enable him to solve mysteries of great magnitude plaguing Toronto, Canada. He's a man ahead of his time (or maybe he has a time machine.)  Of the gizmos created by Murdock and others, we see the invention of a flying machine, (nope, Wilbur and Orville Wright do not make an appearance), the use of radium dust and its properties are explored and a hint of its destructive powers are given, a metal detector, and others.  In a nod to the famous, we meet Sherlock Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle (before his knighthood) returns to be introduced to the fictional character he created.  Winston Churchill makes an appearance in which, Inspector Brackenreid speculates he could be ""Prime Minister"" one day.  My favorite invention of this season is ""silly rubber.""  I will date myself and say that as a kid I played with the 20th century version of this.  Do they still make it?Thank goodness, all the great supporting characters return.  Inspector Brackenreid, Constable George Crabtree, Constable Henry Higgins, Dr. Emily Grace, Dr. Julia Ogden, Dr. Darcy Garland, and Chief Constable Giles.  Inspector Brackenreid continues to ""occasionally"" knock back a few glasses of his favorite beverage and his wife continues to frown upon it.  We meet his growing sons who are polite and respectful.  A concept totally foreign in today's portrayal of children/parent relationships.  Constable Crabtree and Dr. Grace step tentatively toward a budding romance and together they make some scientific discoveries of their own.  Constable Higgins is still efficient as the identifiable colleague in the collection of busy constables.  Dr. Julia Ogden is well, Julia.  She remains a lone crusader for equality for women in all issues with an emphasis on birth control and now divorce.  She and Murdock remain in love and wish to marry.  Julia's husband Darcy throws up some roadblocks there causing the two star-crossed lovers to consider their options.  (I confess to tiring of this thread in the series.)  And what would a season be without Mr. James Pendrick?All episodes are fun, fanciful, intriguing, and an all-around pleasure to watch.  I don't want to give anything away but I will say that I enjoyed episode five, Murdoch Au Naturel, wherein someone (or two?) goes undercover, or rather, uncovered to infiltrate a nudist colony.Enjoy!",Murdoch Mysteries: Season 6

1628314,"I admit it, I got sucked into 'Olympus Has Fallen' from the first, fairly nail-biting scene.  The film's come under a lot of criticism both for its ""anti-Asian sentiment"" (bull-crap, the bad guys here are North Korean, giving the Middle Easterners a break for once ... and let's face it, lately the North Koreans haven't been so friendly in real life either.  The other critique comes from the supposedly unbelievable plotting, starting with no less than Gerard Butler's character singlehandedly fighting an army of armed professional killers ... but to me, for films like this a suspension of belief is mandatory; you have to just set logic aside and enjoy from the gut.  This film is like 'Die Hard at the White House' and it grabs and holds you for its entire two-hour run.Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, bodyguard to no less than the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) ... until a tragedy not of Banning's making gets Mike relegated to a desk job at the Treasury a year later.  But when the White House itself comes under siege by a veritable army that strikes by air, land and even from within, as the body count grows way into double digits it comes down to Banning and his inside knowledge of both the White House and President to make his way into the captured 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, making his way down to the underground bunker where the President remains captive.Films speak best to me when the plot or characters are so real that I become engaged in what's going to happen next.  With 'Olympus Has Fallen' if you're seeking deep plot or characterization then BOY are you watching the wrong film.  But once in awhile, much as you like filet mignon, a fat hamburger piled high with toppings just yells comfort food - and that's what this film did for me.  PURE propaganda, mindless action/violence, and an adrenaline-charged homage to America are what you have hear, and damnit but it's just sort of a blast to watch.  Also very involving; at times, the more they destroyed and desecrated the White House, as an American it was such a violation, I found myself fairly itching to tear into the screen and rip the faces off the bad guys for destroying such an iconic symbol of the USA.  It was an unnerving feeling, but I ran with it, jazzing up my adrenaline even more for a film that's brainless and silly and as far-fetched as Kim Kardashian getting a Master's degree ... but damnit, still so freaking engaging from start to finish.",N/A

She either could excel academically and get a job, or she could find a husband who could take care of her. It is interesting how Jenny's parents are motivated by this mode of thinking and how it guides their actions. There is an aspect to the story which borders on statutory laws regarding sex with a girl who is barely of adult age. The storytellers finesse their way around this and focus on the relationship and do a tasteful job in minimizing the lurid possibilities. Subtle hints of racism are folded into the narrative, this being the 1960's.In the end, it is Carey Mulligan in a star making turn as the idealistic teen who matures ahead of her own time and learns about life the hard way.",N/A
1550364,"""Searching for Sugar Man"" was made by first-time Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul about the quest by two South African music fans to find out what happened to a hero of their youth, an American musician called ""Rodriguez"" who made two folk-rock albums in the 1970s, then was rumored to have died by suicide. Stephen ""Sugar"" Segerman wrote some liner notes for the 1996 re-release of Rodriguez' second album ""Coming from Reality"" (1971) on CD. Though Rodriguez had been immensely popular in 1970s South Africa and an inspiration to the anti-apartheid and Afrikaans music movements, no one there knew any more about him than was written on the album cover. With little to go on, Segerman asked for information in his liner notes. South African music journalist Craig Bartholomew-Strydom, also an avid fan of Rodriguez, took up the challenge and tried to track down information on Rodriguez through the supply chain for his albums.The two men would both have success, but the project would turn out very differently that they had imagined. That's what makes ""Searching for Sugar Man"" so compelling. It's a surprising, almost magical story that could not have happened in today's internet-connected world. Nevertheless, it did happen a short time ago, and it's a real crowd-pleaser. The film has a great soundtrack too, featuring fourteen of Rodriguez' original songs, including ""Sugar Man"", the song of the title. This is one of those rare films that will send people straight out to buy the soundtrack. Director Malik Bendjelloul worked on a shoestring budget and even shot some scenes with his iPhone, doing the illustrations and editing himself. After four years of work on the film, he ran out of money and was at risk of leaving an unfinished project. But now the film is a minor hit and nominated for an Academy Award. There's a bit of fairy tale in that story too.Though its director may have been inexpert, ""Searching for Sugar Man"" is well-constructed, engaging and inspiring. It does leave some questions lingering, however: Rodriguez was also a big hit in Australia and toured there in 1979 and 1981. He played to sixteen sold-out concert halls. The film doesn't mention that. And why did Sussex Records drop Rodriguez before his third album was completed if the albums were selling well in other parts of the world? The producers of his first two albums were disappointed by US sales, but did they not know that foreign sales were respectable? The explanation may be that sales did not exist in Australia or South Africa until the mid-1970s, by which time Sussex Records was out of business. Was part of the confusion over the success of these albums abroad and over royalties due to the fact that Sussex Records folded in 1975? ""Searching for Sugar Man"" focuses on the South African story.The DVD (Sony 2013): The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer.

232465,"Anyone familiar with director John Huston knows he likes stories about desperate people.  On the surface, the viewer may conclude this work is a break from that theme, but not so.  The six main characters are all unhappy souls desperately clinging to anything that resembles normalcy.  The plot?  Major Penderton works constantly in order to repress his homosexuality, while his wife Leonora starts an affair to fill her sexual appetites.  However, their ""marriage"" is put to the test when a young private becomes obsessed with Leonora.  Now then, Huston does his best to assemble a thought-provoking piece that explores dysfunctional relationships.  Unfortunately, the effort fails in its attempt due largely to the odd sub-plot involving the wife and houseboy of Lt. Col. Langdon.  Too much time is spent on this bizarre relationship since too little is gleaned from those scenes.  An audience doesn't need ten minutes or more to recognize crazy.  Indeed, this picture doesn't want to tell a conventional story, but no work should include extraneous elements that do not advance the plot.  ""Reflections In A Golden Eye"" is a loosely knit psychological drama that unwinds well before the third act.COMMENTS:  {SPOILER ALERT}  The ending is particularly disappointing because of the way Huston decides to shoot it.  Major Penderton has just slain Private Williams waking Leonora in the process.  With one continuous shot bouncing between the three characters over and over again, the film goes from a drama to a farce.  Before now, I can only recall observing this see-saw technique in comedies.  After watching this movie however, I think the joke is perhaps on the viewer.",Reflections in a Golden Eye VHS

I wish the movie had expounded a bit more on the race of Souls ~ I loved Wanderer's job in the new world being a teacher and her knowledge and experiences in all the other world's she had lived. Her time in the cave and relationships she developed with everyone were also just a glimpse of what the books had.A lot of things were glossed over and condensed, losing much of richness and character development as well as some of the emotion. I would most likely give it a 3.5 but at the same time, I enjoyed it. A short movie of course will be condensed from such a large book and I really liked what they did with the setting and environment. It definitely brought the book back to life for me and it gives me a chance to share it with others who would probably never read the book. I liked most of the actors, especially Jeb and her brother, Jamie. Melanie/Wanda was good though sometimes came across younger than I felt she should have. Some of the romance felt rushed or cheesy but I expected that. I also expected Melanie's inner dialogue. Wanda never actually spoke to Melanie out loud in the books but then, in a movie that would be confusing at who's thoughts were speaking so I can't complain too much about it.I think the movie captured the main feelings of the story. It has a slow pacing too it ~ this is not your action sci-fi movie but more a character drama and some romance in a very unusual survival futuristic setting. I would recommend watching it, but will never replace the book.",The Host

231446,"As other reviewers have commented, this is just a small part of the actual book - and that part is tweaked and utterly altered to its detriment.James Dean (Cal) absolutely carries the movie; but from the very opening we are well aware he's going to get it together with his brother's girl, Abra. In the book the idea doesn't really crop up till the end. And no viewer could have any feeling for goody-goody brother Aron nor the irritating Abra - Steinbeck gives a depth and understanding to his characters.The boys' mother Kate, who abandoned them to be a brothel mistress, is a hugely darker person than is shown here. I appreciate that 50s censorship meant mention couldn't be made of what went on in her house of ill repute; but neither do we hear anything of her past - she was 'just a drifter' whom Adam Trask fell for. What about her setting the parental home on fire; her poisoning the former madame ?Of course it's a long book and I understand it needed 'pruning'. Perhaps Lee, the faithful Chinese retainer, who features massively in the book, wouldn't translate to well to film. But when the actual events and personalities are so re-written, I can't really say it bears much relation to the book. On its own merits alone, I found it a rather stilted effort - with the exception of the excellent James Dean.",N/A

1670471,"This biopic on the life of Pope John Paul I is interesting to say the least. Excellent acting, very good cinematography and an excellent story line. It does try very sincerely to capture the life and the very short reign of the man sometimes called the 'September Pope'.This film begins in 1977 in Fatima, Portugal, where the then Cardinal Luciani is on pilgrimage speaking on the appartions of Our Lady of Fatima, when a message arrives that a nun in the convent in Coimbra, would like to meet him. This nun is none other that Sr. Lucia, the surviving visionary of the Fatima Apparitions. Perplexed, Cardinal Luciani goes and meets with her. Thus begins the story of the life of this humble man in a series of flash backs, taken from his teenage years in his little provincial town of Forno di Canale in Northern Italy; his call to the holy priesthood, his family life, his work as a parish priest, the impressions he made on his superiors and so on.Notably, this film shows that this Pope was very much interested in reforming the curia and the Vatican bank. We also meet quite a few interesting persons in this film, namely Saint John XXIII, Pope Paul VI and Saint John Paul II.One could question, what would have transpired had Pope John Paul I not passed away in such an untimely fashion? Untimely - merely a word that I choose, but everything lies in the ineffable will of God, which is Divine Mercy and Providence. Good seeds always bear fruit, and one will never really know what fruit has been borne by the seeds planted by this Pope.The title of this review if from the movie, when Sister Lucia predicts the impending outcome of the then forthcoming conclave. Apparently this meeting actually happened!Ultimately this is a film of faith, of devotion to family, friends, church and to the entire people of God, in the service of God, from a man who was a True Pastor, whom we can call  'The Reluctant Pope'.This DVD is 120 minutes long in Italian, with subtitles in English and Spanish. It does not have any special features, nor scene selections, and does not come with the usual Ignatius press booklet on the film with study guide.",Pope John Paul I: The Smile of God

Thus, any exposure of any bits of truth about Tibet since the 1950s is vitally important.  China's military over ran Tibet then, occupied it then and now, and has a record of brutality there equal any to Khan.  The magnitude of crimes against humanity there is so huge that, to ignore it all, is to condemn the world to charges of cooperation.However, Tibetan Buddhism, which is being crushed in the most horrible ways possible by the Red Chinese, and this sacred place of its residence was and is despoiled and desecrated near to extinction.  By Tibetan Buddhist beliefs, such horror will result in centuries of horrid karma coming to Red China.  Some see the choking air of their cities as an early sign.

I always enjoy Hitchcock thrillers and this is a good one.",N/A
1367196,"I picked up this movie from a Blockbuster store that was going under for a whole $2 on Blu Ray. Honestly, I didn't even know Adrien Brody was in it, but when I saw that he was, that's when I really gave the movie a try. I loved him in The Pianist and in The Jacket. As the movie got underway, I then saw that Forest Whitaker was in the movie as well. It was then that I felt the movie really had some legs to stand on so I was a little excited.I was let down.The performances by Brody and Whitaker are quite good. Brody plays the role of a peaceful, everyday Joe who answers an ad for a controlled experiment with the promised pay day of $14k. Once there, he meets Whitaker's character who is presented to us as a devout Christian. After some prescreening, both of them, along with several others, are selected to take part in the experiment. Once they arrive at the facility, it is explained to them that they will all be divided into 2 groups: one will be prisoners and the others will be guards. There are a few rules given to the guards as soon as they are getting dressed to start the experiment. Whitaker's character is selected to play a guard while Brody's is to play a prisoner.******SPOILERS AHEAD! STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW SPECIFIC DETAILS!******The concept is laid out cut and dry for us and you can almost immediately tell where this is headed. Still, you find yourself wanting to watch. As the movie progresses though, there is a major plot hole that, in itself, almost does the movie in. A character by the name of Benjy is selected as a prisoner. It is later revealed that Benjy is diabetic. He lies on his application for the project by saying that he controls it with diet when he actually has to take insulin injections. On day two of the experiment, he asks for something to help with his blood sugar levels which are getting low. In most cases, a diabetic with low blood sugar could simply have a decent meal and be just fine. However, instead of simply giving him food, the guards ignore his request and leave him in his weakened state. Being from a family of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, I can assure you if Benjy had not gotten something to eat, he would have been in very serious danger of going into a diabetic coma. From the signs he was displaying, it looked as if he was in dire need of something to eat. Yet, he supposedly goes another full day without eating. He is simply shown laying down in his cell the entire time while the rest of the prisoners go off and have their three meals. Not eating for an entire day can be tough on the average person, but for a diabetic it might as well be a death sentence. Any person with diabetes would have surely succumbed and, at the very least, gone into a coma. Some would have probably died. Later in the film, Benjy ends up getting the insulin he brought with him, but was not allowed to take into the experiment. Having not eaten for an extended period of time, no diabetic would then take insulin as it is used to keep blood sugar levels low. Only if Benjy had been eating should he have taken his insulin. Adrien Brody's character is seen later bringing Benjy a single piece of bread which is not nearly enough for a diabetic to survive on. It is this glaring oversight that, for me, discredits the film as far a believability.Another issue, although smaller, is the set itself. All the participants are supposedly housed in a brick building. During the climax of the film, several prisoners are seen running through a hallway and as they push their hands up against a brick wall, you can actually see the wall wobble. I know you have to suspend disbelief when you watch a film, but the mistakes were so obvious they were hard to ignore.Some of the violence feels very contrived. One of the first disagreements between the guards and the prisoners happens when a prisoner accidentally hits a guard in the face with a basketball. Apologies are given immediately. As a way to punish the prisoner for this, he is asked to do 10 pushups. While the prisoner is a little older, ten pushups seems reasonable and actually very light as far as punishment...yet, he still refuses to do it. From there and through the rest of the movie, the punishments escalate.Brody and Whitaker do turn in very good performances which is why I granted the film the rating that I did. Without their star power and talent, the film is pretty much a throwaway. Clifton Collins, Jr, while not as big a star as Brody and Whitaker, did play the role of a member of the Aryan Brotherhood very well and his performance should also be seen as a bright spot.The rest of the performances felt weak to me. I just couldn't buy some of the others guys in the movie at all. I don't know if it was their performance or if Brody and Whitaker simply outshined them to the point where they came across as first time actors.The transfer to Blu Ray was quite good. The sound quality was there and the picture was clear and crisp on my 48"" HD television. The coloring in certain scenes just shined. I wish more films were transferred as well as this one was.Overall, I can see why the film was a direct to video movie. It really is a shame though. Given the two leads, you'd think they would have had someone fact check more on the writing side. It's not often you get two men who both won Academy Awards into a film together. While some might find the film good, I have to say that it is average at best and the only reason to give it a look is because of the performances turned in by its two stars.2.5 / 5",N/A

I don't feel a need to compare it to the other two, this being the third in the series, but it does has a lighter tone and sticks to the point better. Still there is a sufficiency of screams (by the cast), ambiguities and warmth to satisfy the average viewer for the somewhat reduced level of real horror. The two lead female parts continue to be neatly handled by two actresses ( Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox), very different in type but attractive and talented. One of the female newcomers also puts in a good performance. It is a far cry from the best of Hitchcock but  I commend it to the audience which has seen the other two as well as those who have not.

Perhaps my expectations were too high going into another British movie, but unfortunately it didn't move me as much as I had hoped. In fact, I fast-forwarded the ending just to get through it.  I so hate giving a two-star review to great artists.  But just because they are, it doesn't make the work itself a great picture.It's a story about a retirement home where aging musicians go to live out the remainder of their lives.  Many of them know each other from the early days when they were at the highlight of their careers.  They have now congregated in one place to continue dabbling in the art of music while they wait for the undertaker to take them away in a body bag.Maggie Smith plays Jean Horton, a once famous and highly sought after opera singer who is now old, broke, and alone.  (Of course they say she's broke, but I'm not sure how she affords the swanky retirement home.)  Like most elderly, her baggage upon arrival is filled with bitterness over life. To make matters worse, she discovers that her ex-husband is living out his days at the retirement home as well.  He's not much better when it comes to forgiveness for Jean's early days of adultery, so most of the movie he has a chip on his shoulder along with the air of being a former star himself.The storyline is weak, superficial, and frankly uninteresting.  I will say this, that it would be a great place to retire! The movie is set in an converted English manor, with gorgeous countryside, comfortable and beautiful interior, kind staff, and an eclectic mix of eccentric elderly. You can sing your days away, rumba to music, croquet to your heart's content, and walk the grounds with a dirty old man, if you'd like. However, the story, at least for me, started with a great premise, but moved at a snail's pace.If the movie accomplishes anything, it does give a poignant view of aging and how one's youth and glory fades. We all know it's coming; perhaps we just don't wish to acknowledge it.Excuse me, while I search the Internet to find a retirement home in the UK that fits the description for retired authors.  I would love to pack my bags and take my own bitterness over life to a swanky retirement home in the English countryside to live out my days. I can pen murder mysteries until they haul me away in a body bag. Works for me.",N/A

1681138,"It's important to begin by saying that this is not the kind of film that everyone will love, it absolutely is the kind of film that will leave most people either surprised and blown away or annoyed that they spent almost 2 hours watching. The movie is more of an experience than a story, so you don't get to know Redford's unnamed character or anything about it, rather you get to experience with him the struggles he goes through to survive. Think of the 2nd act of Castaway, if you took away the first act of that film you wouldn't have connected with Tom Hank's character and would be left watching a man trying to survive. That's exactly what this film does, and it does a great job of not just giving the audience something to watch but really pulls you in. This is in no small part due to the director and Redford's strong performance.If you can handle watching a movie that is more about the experience, and not about a story, this might be a film you'll love. Others might find it boring, as the character doesn't say anything for the most part and at times seems to be doing mundane things. It's this side of the experience that might make people see All is Lost as a slow and pointless film. Personally, I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I know a number of my friends would not like it, and I'm not surprised by it at all.",N/A

In fact, other than the toddler who was instantly (and vocally) bored, the rug-rats seemed very involved; they were quiet and well-behaved.

1233435,"I previously owned all of the Ninja Turtle movies on DVD, but I decided I would go ahead and finally convert them to Blu-Ray because for one, the movies are all upgrade worthy...two, I have been converting much of my DVD collection to Blu-Ray anyway...three, I love cool sets, and four, I hated the DVD case my original Ninja Turtles movie was in (you know...those annoying taller cases with those latches on them that make it complicating to put other DVDs in next to) and I had dual discs (the TMNT DVD was a dual disc and I hate those).  LOL, yes...I am a tad knit picky when it comes to my movies.Anyway, this 25th anniversary edition set has become a collector's item and people are selling it for absurd amounts now...I think the lowest new price I'd seen for it was like $100.00.  I had been wanting the set for a while but had not been able to yet, but my wife told me to go ahead and get it as a Christmas gift, (and ironically it showed up on Christmas Eve).  I couldn't spent no $100+ on it though, but I happened to find a used one in decent shape for $50.  Upon receiving it, I looked over the packaging, discs, and collectibles and I was uber excited!  Those first 3 movies were childhood favorites of mine and I very much enjoyed TMNT too, and just having those all together in a cool set like this was just amazing.  Even if I started converting some things to a future format, I seriously doubt I'd ever sell this set unless I absolutely needed too financially, because I love everything about Blu-Ray anyway and this set is just awesome!Firstly, the packaging...super cool!  The case is designed to look like a pizza box, and it even has a makeshift grease spot on the back much like a pizza box would.  The discs are all made up to look like pizzas, which I thought was pretty clever.  The collectible cards and the collectible artwork are all really cool, and I like the collectible comic a lot too...all cool stuff.  The only thing about mine was that the plush beanie was not included in it, and the seller was up front about that, but in all honesty I wasn't as concerned with the beanie...I mainly wanted the discs and the other collectibles.  If you're a fan of the Ninja Turtles movies, if you can manage it, you really ought to try and acquire this set!  It's super awesome!As for the movies, well...as I mentioned above, the original 3 are childhood favorites.  Ninja Turtles is simply one of my favorite things, and I use to watch the original cartoon show as well.  It's almost a shame that a handful of the original episodes wasn't included in this set, but not a big deal...I own a few of the volumes anyway.  TMNT obviously came along later on down the line, but it was quite enjoyable itself...I'd honestly wished they'd made a trilogy from that one but I'll take it as is.  Here are my individual ratings for each film:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: 5/5Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II Secret of the Ooze: 5/5Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III Turtles In Time: 4/5TMNT: 4/5Again, if you are as big a fan of the Ninja Turtles movies as I am, definitely try and get your hands on this set.  I have not looked at any features yet in this set, but I've never been a real big feature kinda guy anyway...only occasionally do I watch any features.  I'm really more about the movies, and these make great marathon material.

Then, I chose the other option, which was the ""long haul"" version which had deleted scenes and interviews with the directors anytime an icon came onto the screen. The very first time the icon appeared, it automatically goes to the interview. However, I was unable to hear any of the dialogue at all! So, I tried to go back to the original version of the movie and now none of the dialogue could be heard either. Only the background music.

You keep talking and I'm gonna take your head off.""Despite finding success in Europe, Charles Bronson still hadn't made it really big in the US in 1974, so Mr. Majestyk was marketed less on his name than on the promise of Richard Fleischer's film being another Billy Jack or Walking Tall, but the film was part of a one-two whammy with Death Wish, released only a week later, that finally propelled him to superstar status Stateside. Bronson may have managed to antagonise his director and crew so much that, according to Fleischer, they would barely talk to him after the first day's shooting but it's the perfect star vehicle for him as the kind of guy who keeps himself to himself until he's pushed too far. Elmore Leonard's script casts him as a melon farmer who manages to get on the wrong side of both Paul Koslo's small-time local hood who tries to cut in on his business and Al Lettieri's hitman with a seriously bad temper, with the police all too happy to use him as live bait and regarding the possibility of him getting killed as a bit of a bonus. All Bronson wants to do is get in his melon crop before his farm goes under, but with Lettieri and co. scaring off or crippling his workers and shooting up his crop it's only a matter of time before a melon farmer's gotta do what a melon farmer's gotta do...Leonard cut his teeth on westerns, and this is very much a well-crafted modern western crossover to his now more recognised thriller work, but it knows its audience and their expectations perfectly and delivers the kind of decent-guy-fighting-back-after-being-pushed-too-far action movies that moviegoers in the 70s just lapped up, and it holds up remarkably well today. Fleischer had already delivered one minor classic thriller down on the farm with 1955's Violent Saturday and here his more than capable direction displays the kind of invisible professionalism that raises the film above its B-movie potential without drawing too much attention to itself while still making the most of the big setpieces like the botched attempt to rescue Lettieri in transit that drives much of the plot and the celebrated machine-gunning of the hero's melon crop sequence that sets the stage for the real violence to come. Bronson's on good form, with Lettieri a particularly threatening bull in a china shop and Paul Koslo giving good weasel as the lowlife with ideas above his abilities who sets the ball rolling. All in all perfectly satisfying Saturday night action fare.MGM/UA's 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen DVD is for the most part a decent transfer, though it has trouble with a few of the darker shots.

1565625,"These films, Red and #2 are ninety-five percent action, of course. But there is actually some acting which takes place, primarily on the part of Malkovitch! According to what I read it says that #2 stayed in the theaters for four months, which is a good run. By the time I saw it, it was already being set for video, so distribution must not have been extensive. #2 must have been relatively expensive to make, filming in the world's major capitals and blowing up so much stuff! We wish more producers could afford to do this with their films. That said, there's something not quite right about the writing in these films. The major premise of the Red's is that it's OK to murder viciously, as long as the victim deserves it! We have retired CIA people murdering other CIA people who are constantly trying to murder them. It's all OK because secret agents and operatives are evil and deserve to die, which for some odd reason is written to be humorous. And that's the major premise of these films. Watching the older female assassin dissolving a dying agent in nitric acid in the tub, as she jokes on the phone sends an odd message. It is well-understood that these types of operatives have no morality, no morals and no particular understanding of right and wrong; and this is apparent in real life as well. To maintain normality we would have to say that the writers are pushing the envelope in what is acceptable and what is not. People who have been close to this type of thing find no humor in it whatsoever!",N/A

That was the FIRST time I watched it.  By the second viewing, I had started putting things together and the movie made more sense. So be patient...if you are a bit confused by things after your initial viewing, give the movie another chance.  Things will click.  As for the dark dreary atmosphere?  Well, I guess that's the look they were going for!The message of the movie is disturbing.  You realize just how awful it would be to live in a country where your every move is determined by ""Big Brother"" (i.e., the government).  You also realize that the government has the ability to lie to you and brainwash you.  You can't even have your own thoughts, or you will be accused of ""thought crime!""

1627525,"I received an invite to this movie from Universal and rearranged my schedule to make sure I could get to the theater early enough. I arrived with about two hours to wait and there were about 40 people already ahead of me so I knew I was going to get into the movie. Let me just start by saying, it was well worth the wait if you're a fan of the original.Let me say right now there are spoilers in this review so don't read it if you don't want to know any of this.Obviously most of you are aware that Chris D'Amico / Red Mist is the Main villain in this film but, he's taken on a new identity known as The Mother F****r and his getup consists of his mom's old bondage outfit. Well his main goal is to make Kick-Ass pay for blowing his dad up. Of course, his mom is holding back his ambitions so, he had to kill her to get her out of the way; once that's done, he begins to form his evil posse known as the Toxic Mega C**ts.Kick-Ass approaches Hit Girl about training him and forming a team and she agrees as she has been skipping school and training everyday since her dad died. Unfortunately, Marcus (her legal guardian) finds out and reminds her that her father's letter wanted better for her so, she backs out of the deal and retires Hit Girl.Colonel Stars and Stripes has already begun forming the team Justice Forever; His team would become the new partners for the man that inspired them in the first place... Kick-Ass!Uncle Ralph took over the family when Chris' father was killed. In an attempt to dissuade Chris from forming his posse Uncle Ralph has Chris' only friend killed and this lesson is not lost on the MotherF****r as he learns to hurt Kick-Ass, he has to hurt those closest to him.So, the basic plot of the movie has always been revenge against Kick-Ass and this revenge starts with the death of Colonel Stars and Stripes, the Beating of Night B***h, and the Death of Kick-Ass' Father. Of course, the ultimate goal is to break the inspiration that is Kick-Ass by killing him, cutting him up, and feeding him to sharks (that's the plan anyway).Through most of the Movie, the MotherF***r and the Toxic Mega C**ts are wreaking havoc on the city and terrorizing the police. To say the least, the lack of Colonel Stars and Stripes has made Justice Forever a little bit weak and the lack of Hit Girl makes matters even worse.My only real gripe with the movie is that they made Todd an even bigger idiot than in the first movie. Everything else about the movie was great and I really enjoyed it.Believe me, if you were at all a fan of the first movie, you're going to love this one!

243764,"John Auer directed this film, and also directed ""Hell's half acre"" which is available on blu ray from Olive.  Of the two I think this is by far the best, and it has a rafter of people hitting up against a wall of noirish problems.  The basic story is a young patrolman wants to quit his job, and run off with his showgirl (taxi dancer) mistress and leave his loving wife behind: all because, darn it, she earns more money than he does.  His dad is a lifelong cop nearing retirement, and his kid brother is enraptured with thug life.  On top of the showgirl has another admirer, a fellow entertainer, who has daydreams that are both scary and pathetic, all of which center on the girl, who is due to take off with the cop.  Edward Arnold pulls many strings behind the scenes as a corrupt lawyer, William Talman is a desperate thug, and Marie Windsor (who else?) plays the bad girl to the hilt.

Going into it, the movie started as interesting by introducing the main characters and setting up the premise. However there are some problems right off the bat. Who filled the missing persons report between the movies? Isn't it a little convienient that Sarah suffered enough stress she doesn't remember what happened? Why bring her back so soon after you found her? Why are you entering the cave's from a totally different enterance? And why have only six people investagate?After that the movie becomes almost like the first one and it got better, good scares, good deaths, good continutity with the first movie and a nice twist. However, the characters aren't nearly as interesting this time and you are more likly to want to see them dead. Another gripe is that one character's behavior just seems unnatural, he appears calm at the start but quickly develops a sense of paranoia that really annoyed me.Then the ending, completly sucked. It felt stupid and was just there so another potential sequel could be possible.

56746,"The Day of the Jackal, starring British actor Edward Fox as The Jackal, a hired assassin, was directed masterfully by Fred Zinnemann, who also directed A Man For All Seasons.  In the 1950s and through the very early 1960s, France was experiencing terrorism as a result of Algeria's quest for independence.  President Charles De Gaulle favored its independence but there was a conservative military group within France, the OAS,  that did not want this. This fictional account describes in great detail the efforts of the group to kill De Gaulle.  They hired a very lethal individual, known as The Jackal, to plot and succeed in eliminating De Gaulle.  Most of the movie concerns the Jackal's careful, painstaking, plan to accomplish the task.  Unknown to him, a very smart, mild-mannered, unassuming French inspector, Lebel, is investigating the case on intelligence that an attempt would be made on De Gaulle.  The Jackal is an extraordinarily cunning individual who is capable of very convincing disguises.  He is almost impossible to detect.  Yet, humble Lebel is not a fool.  He's not inspector Clouseau and he pursues the case relentlessly and with understated courage until the Jackal is identified as he comes very close to accomplishing his objective.  In the end, the Jackal meets his date with an unmarked grave.  No one ever knew his actual identity.The cinematography in this film is almost stunning.  The European locations, especially Paris, are beautifully filmed and the color is gorgeous but also realistic.  This is an interesting and suspenseful movie with an excellent script.  Althought it was released in 1973 at a time in which crude language was becoming increasingly prevalent in filmdom, there is no use of it here, which is refreshing compared to today's idea of what acceptable script writing requires.",The Day of the Jackal

677494,"This black and white film war film was made in 1943 for propaganda purposes and it was one of better Hollywood WWII morale raisers, mostly, but not exclusively, because of stellar performance by Humphrey Bogart. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.1. Origins and descendance of &#34;Sahara&#34;This film traces its roots to a short novel called &#34;Patrol&#34;, written by Philip MacDonald, a British veteran of World War I. It told the story of a group of eleven British soldiers surrounded by hostile Arab tribesmen in a small oasis in the middle of Iraqi desert, during 1918 Mesopotamian campaign. The novel became popular and was adapted to the screen first time in United Kingdom as a silent movie in 1929, under the title &#34;Lost patrol&#34;. The film was quite good, Hollywood noticed it and in 1934 John Ford directed an American remake. His version, named &#34;The lost patrol&#34;, became a worldwide success, thanks in large part to the amazing performances of Victor McLaglen and Boris Karloff.Amongst people who loved this film the most was Stalin himself, who, unknowingly to most people, adored American cinema - when in the same time refusing his subjects the right to watch those &#34;decadent&#34; movies. Stalin enjoyed greatly those private s&eacute;ances in Kremlin's projection room during which he could relax between two campaigns of mass murder... &#34;The lost patrol&#34; pleased him so much that he ordered a Soviet remake, and it was indeed turned in 1936 and released in 1937, under the title &#34;The Thirteen&#34;.Soviet director Mikhail Romm changed of course the story, transferring the time of action to Russian Civil War (1917-1922) and the place of action to Central Asia deserts. The total number of defenders of the oasis was increased to thirteen (a number considered as unlucky in Russia too), including eleven Red Army soldiers and two civilians. The enemies were Central Asian Muslim tribesmen led by White Armies counter-revolutionary officers. Stalin liked this film too and as result Mikhail Romm wasn't executed or send to a concentration camp during the Great Terror (1934-39) as so many of his colleagues...Then came December 1941, United States entered war and soon became allies of Soviet Union. Hollywood started a mass production of patriotic flag waivers the day after Pearl Harbor and in the end of 1942, with all the excitement around the operation &#34;Torch&#34; and battles of El Alamein and Stalingrad, somebody had the idea of making a film which would celebrate the allied soldiers fighting in the desert when in the same time being a nice gesture towards the Soviets - a Hollywood adaptation of &#34;The Thirteen&#34;.The film, released ultimately in November 1943, became a great success and was later remade twice more: in 1953 as a western &#34;Last of the Comanches&#34; (a.k.a. &#34;The sabre and the arrow&#34;) and in 1995 again under the title &#34;Sahara&#34;, with James Belushi taking over the main role once played by Victor McLaglen in 1934 and Humphrey Bogart in 1943.2. The filmThe action of this film takes place in 1942 immediately after the battle of Gazala (26 May - 21 June), which was Rommel's greatest and most brilliant victory ever - therefore ipso facto it was also a particularly difficult time for the British forces in North Africa, as their great fortress of Tobruk was lost and they were forced to retire deep into Egypt... In this film it was decided to add some American troops to British 8th Army even if in reality not even a single US soldier fought in North Africa before the operation &#34;Torch&#34; in November 1942.Therefore, at the beginning of the film we can see five American trying desperately to repair their damaged tank &#34;Lulu Belle&#34; to avoid capture by Germans. Their leader is Sergeant Joe Gunn played by Humphrey Bogart in person. One the crewmembers, Fred Clarkson is played by Lloyd Bridges who, even if he is today more remembered for his &#34;Airplane&#34; and &#34;Hot Shots&#34; comedy roles in the 80s and 90s, was already in this time an experienced actor and since he began his career in 1936 &#34;Sahara&#34; was already his 43rd film!A little bit later in the film the five Americans will be joined by five &#34;Limeys&#34;, a Sudanese sergeant from British Army, his Italian prisoner and a Free French corporal. The presence in this time and in this place of Free French troops, which fought excellently at Bir Hakeim, a battle waged in the same time as the greater Gazala fight further north, is actually a historical fact. The last to join this group - very, VERY unwillingly - will be a Luftwaffe pilot, whose plane was shot down. Those fourteen ill-assorted companions and &#34;Lulu Belle&#34; will try to make it back to allied lines by going through the deep desert, when avoiding roaming German patrols, some of them pretty large and heavily armed. Then, of course, they will at one moment find a little abandoned oasis with a very small but incredibly precious water hole... And then the film really begins.3. My general impressions about the filmIt is a rather good war film and it is always a pleasure to watch Bogie in any film - as far as I am concerned I would watch him even in a commercial for broccoli...))) The desert and the abandoned oasis are very well filmed and the black and white actually adds to the charm of the film rather than diminishing it. Action scenes are not half bad, even if they are NOT so many and the ending is particularly STRONG!That being said, the propaganda character of this film is obvious from the beggining to the end and many dialogs are actually just the recitation of slogans - and with time it becomes a little bit annoying. I found also amusing and very naive the attempts to explain that ultimately Christianity and Islam (the Sudanese sergeant is Muslim), well, it is more or less the same thing...))) The German pilot character is so evil that he is obviously a total caricature - as is, in the different register, the hapless and pathetic Italian prisoner Giuseppe...4. Lulu BelleThe tank which carries the heroes deep into the desert and is their main weapon against the wandering Germans hordes is a M3 Lee, a medium tank introduced into service in US Army in August 1941, of which many hundreds were delivered to United Kingdom as part of lend and lease agreement. The M3 Lee was quite heavily armored and powerfuly armed, with one 75 mm and one 37 mm gun, as well as four machine guns. It took no less than six men to operate a M3 Lee. Many of those tanks took part in battle of Gazala and they performed well, as they were actually more powerful than Wehrmacht's Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks used in this time - still, Rommel's superior tactics allowed Germans to destroy and capture most of British tanks at Gazala. The M3 Lee and its improved version, M3 Grant, served in first line until the end of war in North Africa in April 1943 - after that, all the survivors were replaced by the much superior M4 Sherman.At least 1300 of those tanks were also delivered to Soviet Union beginning with the end of 1941 and initially they served well, but with the arrival in summer 1942 on the Eastern Front of German new Panzer IVF2 tanks and Pak 40 75mm anti-tank guns, they became much, much more vulnerable. In 1943, with casualties mounting, their Soviet crews started to call them &#34;Six brother's grave&#34; but so great were the needs of Red Army that they continued to be used in the first line until the apocalyptic Kursk battle in July 1943. After this monumental fight the few that were left were send to secondary sectors, like Arctic Front.This film is definitely the best occasion for all military history freaks to see a M3 Lee in action - a lot!CONCLUSION: for all reasons explained above, this is a quite interesting war film. Not exactly a masterpiece, somehow aged and certainly damaged a little by the heavily served propaganda, but still quite worth seeing. Enjoy!",N/A

Yes, the film takes a lot of Hollywood screen story telling in order to produce a viable, and I might add entertaining story line.  I think that this film is about the human side of this time period, whether historically correct or not.  In order to make this historical event entertaing, this liberty is granted.  I have studied the written history of the Northeast durin this period and I might add that it seems to be a very dry gathering and presentation of facts.

Almost immediately old feelings come up and tensions start to mount. When secrets are revealed the life-long friendships are threatened. Before I start I will admit I have never seen the original movie but the first five minutes seemed like a recap and at no time did I feel lost. I didn't really have any of the character back stories but I caught up pretty fast. As far as this movie goes I wasn't expecting anything all that amazing and was a little hesitant. The main reason for that is because I have never been a Tyler Perry fan (not to sound racist). Even though this isn't one of his movies that is what I was expecting. I'm not sure if it was my low expectations or not but I really enjoyed this much much more then I thought I was going to. The best way to describe this is a version of Why Did I Get Married but funnier and with more like-able characters. This movie is funny but has a real plot and real emotion in it that sucks you in and makes you care about each character. I can't say how it compares to the first one but I can tell you I really did enjoy this one. Overall, a better version of Why Did I Get Married that surprised me as to how much I enjoyed it.

1394095,"This is a wonderful film. I wouldn't limit it to 'gay' film and would recommend it to anyone interested in the nature of love and has even half an open mind. It touches much broader aspects of life, the transcendence of love, the female archetype, societal roles, the conflict that can arise when following one's heart and it does it in a beautiful way.  It is about two women who are very much in love. One, so very sure about love and its expressions, bearing the weight and cost of that (societal) naivete. It takes a few minutes for the other to catch up which seems natural when one is offered a possibility they didn't know existed. Sex is truly an expression of their love. It doesn't hurt they take off their clothes because it hits the societal role issues head on. It's also aesthetically beautiful and took my breath away.  The film a complex emotional story; well acted and well directed. The message: be who you are.At first, I was a little disappointed it was a period piece but that flew out the window by the fifth minute.

1571596,"American NightmareThe ""Katarina's Nightmare Theatre"" range of DVD's from Scorpion Releasing has brought new life to some long forgotten horror gems from the video era, and I for one am very happy about that.  I genuinely feel that - despite some snoozers and losers - their overall range is one of the most fan-friendly and interesting on the market today.  This film hasn't been available in my neck of the world since the days of videotape, so it's a welcome addition to my collection.""American Nightmare"" is an early-eighties Canadian tax-shelter production from Paul Lynch, the man behind ""Prom Night"" and ""Humongous"".  It's a grimier film than either of those, and deliberately so. It's not ""Maniac"" level grimy, and there are some occasional light moments, but overall an attempt has been made here to deglamourize the big city and emphasize its potential to degrade and dehumanize.  The story revolves around a murdered young woman from a good family who had fallen into a life of prostitution and general seediness.  The subsequent attempt by her brother to solve the mystery of her death sees him navigating through a sordid milieu of drugs, death and degenerates (and startling videotapes).  The denizens of this underworld are mostly unsympathetic (except the obligatory stripper with a heart of gold who assists him with his quest), and everybody is motivated by the desire to extract whatever they can from absolutely anybody else.  Perversion lurks everywhere in this urban nightmare and nobody can be trusted, not even dear old Dad. Yikes.This is a worthwhile viewing experience if you come to it knowing what to expect.  Things aren't bright and pretty here, and I'm not just talking about Michael Ironside (playing a detective, and very well too).  The city is grey and dangerous, the strippers are past their prime, the cops don't know things they should, the pimps aren't pleasant, nobody is helpful and street life has consequences. (It almost sounds like a documentary).  There are points in the film when the killer could conceivably be almost any member of the cast, some genuine suspense is generated (at times), and the conclusion isn't what you might have anticipated.  When it comes to watching this type of movie, you could do much worse than this.There is one major negative with this DVD - it is full-frame.  A title card prior to the commencement of the film indicates that only fullscreen elements were available from the distributor (probably a video master).  It's better than having nothing of course, but I would love to have this in widescreen.  Colours are muted, but that just adds to the atmosphere in my humble opinion.  Extras include a feature commentary with Paul Lynch and Katarina (as well as a very informative interview with him), an audio interview with writer John Sheppard, and some trailers for other films in the product line.Overall, this is an interesting diamond-in-the-rough DVD and I for one will be looking out for more resurrected gems from Katarina in the near future.",N/A

1580232,"I must preface by saying that I like Kung Fu movies -- and I've seen my share of them. The Man with the Iron Fists has the body of a new style Chinese Martial Arts film like House of the Flying Daggers, the brains of Enter the Dragon, and the soul of Machete -- although it's not nearly as much fun as Robert Rodriquez's similar riff on the Mexican Gangster film. Fists isn't really a Chinese film at all, although plenty of the talent is from the Middle Kingdom, but instead is a re-envisioned fantasy of the Kung Fu genre through the eyes of Wu-Tang mastermind and rapper RZA. He wrote, directed, and starred.There's a lot to like in this film (as a Kung Fu fan). The characters are pretty memorable in a comic book, kung fu, video game kind of way. They each have their own weapons, powers, and gimmicks. A few of them are even well acted (or over acted) like Russell Crowe's entertaining performance as Jack Knife or Lucy Liu as Black Widow. Many have bad hair.RZA and his titular character forms the weakest link. He's just flat. His voice over is hard to understand and the rapper voice narrating Kung Fu feels totally out of place. But his music's good. And despite some nearly incoherent editing and minimal storytelling, the overall style is pretty decent.The villains are pretty darn cheesy, particularly the heavy metal fright wig hair styles of the Lion Clan, but whatever, it's a campy almost spoof of the Kung Fu genre. It's gory as hell too, but despite numerous brothel scenes, strangely chaste (no nudity at all). Hmmm, there's that weird violence is better than sex thing. What gives? A big chunk of backstory on RZA's character shoved into the middle of the film is a total snooze-a-rama, but other than  that, the action scenes are exciting and the brothel scenes funny, so if you like the genre, go for it. Just remember, it's just no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and not even up to the standards of Kung Fu Hustle.Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimed",N/A

The Director, and Writer of this version really messed it up with this mindless violence/destruction that centered mostly on one city that made this movie not very enjoyable.  It was way too much destruction that took up much of the movie.  Also the break up of the scenes starting with the man of steel as an adult than to childhood, and than back again, almost caused me to just turn it off.  So, so at best, and I'm being generous.

1293493,"Paris is a complex web of interconnected stories that messily tie together, leaving a lot of loose ends but also simulating the messiness of real life.The film centers around Pierre (Duris), a young man who finds out he may be dying from a heart condition and will need a transplant in order to survive.  His sister, Elaine (Binoche), is the only one in his family he initially tells of his condition and she promptly moves her and her children to live with him though they have previously been distant.  Pierre, a former dancer, is no longer able to perform due to his heart condition, and now finds pleasure in observing the lives of those around him--nods to Hitchcock's &#34;Rear Window&#34;.  Among those is an attractive young woman living in an apartment across the street from his, and her story is perhaps just as interesting--she is torn between two suitors, one a fellow student and the other an older man.  While Elaine is assisting Pierre in the physical sense by helping with meals and cleaning, she benefits as much as him if not more from their repaired relationship--after Pierre convinces her to live her life fully, Elaine opens up to a friendly longtime acquaintance, with satisfying results.The acting in this film is brilliant, even though I speak English and watched most of this film on mute, just reading the subtitles, I didn't feel that I missed out. Binoche's Elaine is melancholy and wounded at times, and sexy and playful at others--depicting her character in a believable and yet striking way.  Pierre, the lead, is played by Duris and the expressiveness in his body language shows his introspection and struggle with his own feelings about mortality.The only thing that I didn't quite get was the plot...a few of the stories fit well and intertwined, but a lot of the extraneous side stories didn't really fit in with the main plot and instead confused me, making the film difficult to follow (i.e. the man immigrating to Paris from Africa, the whole backstory with the professor, etc.)  The film was overall good, because of its memorable acting, but the tangled web of story lines left a lot to be desired.",N/A

440348,"I've read the reviews that gave this film only 1 or 2 stars. People said it was dull, boring, too long, the actors were too scripted and unrealistic, there was no story to it like there was in the Jerry Bruckheimer film, and on and on. Obviously people are very different about things and everybody has a right to their opinion.But I think that these folks are missing the point. ""Tora!, Tora!, Tora!"" is to Bruckheimer's ""Pearl Harbor"" what ""A Night to Remember"" was to James Cameron's ""Titanic."" Most people who saw ""A Night To Remember"" when it came out, and also saw Cameron's ""Titanic,"" will tell you that as sensational as Cameron's version was of the event, ANTR was more like the real thing. And that's because that was the film producer's intention in the first place; entertainment was secondary. In fact, in ANTR, 4th Officer Boxhall, who was on the real Titanic and survived the sinking, was on the set of ANTR and was one of the consultants in the making of the movie, so it would be done accurately.""Tora!, Tora!, Tora! was done much the same way. The producers used both American and Japanese military historians to try to portray both sides' point of view as accurately as possible. And once again -- the primary objective was to recreate on film an accurate portrayal of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Entertainment was an important factor, but it was secondary to the primary objective. Furthermore, while the actors in this movie were not the most colorful or popular or charismatic in Hollywood, they were nonetheless very representative of the naval and army officers and top government officials of that time. They looked and sounded and acted the part very well. George Macready in particular was outstanding in his portrayal of Cordell Hull, Secretary of State.And I can't close my comments without including this: the Japanese flagship in the real event was the aircraft carrier, Akagi. In the movie, you see the Japanese planes taking off of the Akagi's flight deck and on to their mission. But the ship you are actually seeing is the USS Yorktown CVS-10 -- MY SHIP, AND I WAS ON IT WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THE MOVIE. When the sequence of the flight take-offs begins, at about the 6th plane taking off, if you look quickly down at the very end of the flight deck, you'll see the number ""10"" on it, my ship's number. Also, right around that same general time frame in the movie, there's a nice aerial shot for a few seconds looking down at the Yorktown (Akagi), showing the entire ship. Anyway, every time I watch ""Tora!, Tora!, Tora!, it's kind of weird to be sitting in my recliner watching my ship and knowing that I am on it there in the movie!",N/A

1486039,"The author, not yet 40 (amazingly) when he wrote the book, has been quoted as saying:""Suddenly, my mind was exploding with ideas. I could hardly keep up with them. In jubilant minutes whole portions of the novel emerged fully formed: the lifeboat, the animals, the intermingling of the religious and the zoological, the parallel stories.  Where did that moment of inspiration come from? Why did I think that religion and zoology would make a good mix? ...I could give approximate answers. That India, where there are so many animals and religions, lent itself to such a story. That tensions simmering just below my level of consciousness were probably feverishly pushing me to come up with a story. But in truth I don't know. It just happened.""""It just happened...."" the rendering of raw life into something far more profound, something universal, a tale known by heart by an unfortunate number of souls who have experienced a ""shipwreck""; and, a morality tale, one that can transcend the obvious carnal horror and touch upon that which is beyond our experience, that in which our experience has its being, and its purpose.What is a shipwreck? One is journeying toward something, with hope, and the vicissitudes of life foul the journey.  When the ""ship"" goes down, everything is lost.  One is left in a hostile world surrounded by the unknown and the horizon disappears twice a day, dawn and dusk, into itself.  There are no markers, there are no maps.A tragedy for which there are no words, a loss so deep that it rivals the power of nature, an ocean of loss.  I know this by heart. I, too, now live with a very large and very dangerous animal.  This is a fight for survival, it is no game, it is no fairy tale.  I feed the beast as best I can and try to avoid it.  Ultimately, I must learn about it and it must - in some way - co-exist with me.  Together, uncomfortable companions, we seek safe harbor.  Safe harbor is far from safe, it is self-consuming.  The only safety is in not looking for it; the only path is back into the journey, the beast and I, toward life.  Can we find it, can we survive? I will not be consumed by the beast, but neither can I consume it.  We are together now, whatever the future.Shall I tell my story in its brutal reality, tearing into the consciousness and sensitivities of those who hear it?  I learn that this is not a prudent choice.  And so I tell it in this way, as I have said, the beast and I.  Everyone fears the beast, do they not?  Yet, not everyone travels with one, and so the story can be safely told.There is magic and even beauty in even the worst horror.  Nothing is without purpose; this is part of the lesson.You cannot tame the beast.  There must be a partnership, a reluctant partnership.  You may find comfort in the oddest of places and when least expected but, ultimately, you must continue the journey.  Or die trying.""Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, He was watching.  Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering, He was watching.  And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest, and gave me a sign to continue my journey.""Evil and horror are real, but they are encapsulated, they are quarantined from the essential element of soul.  The beast can enter our lives; we can succumb to the horror and be eaten alive, by our own lack of hope and loss of faith.  Or we can arrive at a place where we, and our beast, co-exist.  I am not yet at the place where my beast leaves me.  Perhaps I never will be.  There is something in us that wants to hold onto the beast.  And we are left with two stories: the horror or the hope.""Can I ask you something?""""Of course.""""I've told you two stories  about what happened out on the ocean.  Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship and no one can prove which story is true and which is not.  In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I survive.""""True.""""So which story do you prefer?""""The one with the tiger, that's the better story.""""Thank you.

1347806,"Flandersui Gae (A Dog of Flanders/Barking Dogs Never Bite) (Joon-ho Bong, 2000)Joon-ho Bong has developed into one of Korea's most popular directors both at home and overseas, first with The Host, the highest-grossing Korean film of all time (viz. review 10Mar2008 ish), and then with Mother, one of the most critically-acclaimed Korean films of all time (viz. review 30Mar2011 ish). But he had a career, and a durned good one, long before coming up with either of those flicks; his second movie, Memories of Murder, is actually my favorite of his flicks (viz. review 1Apr2008 ish), and while it didn't really gain notoriety outside Korea until after he'd gotten big for his other movies, his debut feature, Flandersui Gae (known in English-speaking countries both as A Dog of Flanders and Barking Dogs Never Bite), was a pretty big hit back in the day. If you know Bong's later work, there's not going to be a good deal here that will surprise you--it's got that patented Bong mix of madcap mystery, uncomfortable humor, broad-spectrum ineptitude on the part of his endearing characters, and a sharp, witty script that brings it all together in a pleasurable way.Plot: Yun-ju (Attack the Gas Station!'s Sun-jae Lee) is a college lecturer who's trying to achieve a professorship in a corrupt culture--it seems to be standard operating procedure for lecturers at his school who want to become professors to ""gift"" the dean with ten thousand bucks. Problem is, lecturers make peanuts, so where's he going to get that kind of money? As if that's not enough, somewhere in his large, faceless apartment block there's a yappy little dog who refuses to shut up. Yun-ju finds himself driven to extremes--once he has identified the beast, he kidnaps it. When he finds he can't bring himself to kill it, he locks it in a cabinet in the basement. When the missing-dog posters start going up, posted by both the dog's young owner and Hyeon-nam (Spring Bears Love's Doona Bae), an interested bookkeeper from the local tax office who had to give the posters an official stamp to make sure the cops didn't take them down, Yun-ju realizes he's got himself a case of mistaken identity--but when he goes to set the pooch free, it's gone...And this kicks off a series of misadventures that has the movie careering wildly between missing-dog mystery (animal lovers beware, there are a few scenes you may find uncomfortable despite the large, prominently-displayed title card at the beginning stating that no animals were harmed during the making of the film), romantic comedy, and Richard Linklater-style slacker drama, with the odd action sequence here and there just to keep the viewer on his or her toes. Like Memories of Murder, the end result seems somewhat directionless, and that does seem a bit more of a problem here than it is in Memories of Murder. But not much more; this movie is still a great deal of fun, as well as being quite technically accomplished for it being the director's feature debut. If you're a Joon-ho Bong fan who's never gotten the chance to check this one out, it may not quite measure up to Bong's later efforts, but it's still a pretty good time. ***",Barking Dogs Never Bite

1543179,"This was the motto of Russian formalists. They claimed that any piece of art or literature must create as many ripples and oddities as possible. This way our perception of the mundane reality will be altered. We will see the world in a new light, which is the purpose of art.The film is made in this tradition - it is one big oddity. It is unusual and sometimes feels like a theater and sometimes like a Monty Python episode. It's unlikely to appeal to those with a taste for traditional drama. But for me - as a Russian - if feels authentic and true to the spirit of the Russian art. My minor qualm is that Anna Karenina in the film is less sympathetic and more eccentric than she should be. Her ""problem"" was her moral integrity and the fact that she was unwilling to keep her affair secret like everyone else in the book. But the authors of the film chose to depict her as an unbalanced neurotic female. That's been said, I highly recommend it.",N/A
1413246,"When the advertisements came up for the show, it intrigued me.  The dinosaur premise was one that was rarely attempted by major studios...and in that rarely successful.  What drew me in to watch that first episode was to see if it would soar above the clouds, or crash and burn like some of the other attempts.  Needless to say, it simply left me in awe.  Not only was the dinosaur premise executed in a very believable manner, they created a tension and struggle that was not dark, grim, and hopeless like many of the shows that season.  But within that struggle resonated hope for a better life, and for nobility & honor.  It may just be me, but the show did leave a mark on me.  I have enjoyed many shows but forgot them after awhile.  Terra Nova, however, was one that stayed with me.FOR PARENTS AND CONCERNED FOLKS:Ok, this show is very much a ""family"" show.  It feels like one (in the best sense of the word).  In fact, the main protagonist really is ""The Shannon Family"".  However, there are some caveats to this.  Language-wise, it's pretty clean (I did like the script, btw) but on occasion (and rarely), the ""D-word"" or ""S-word"" does come up.  There really isn't any innuendos and such...but the violence may be an issue for some.  It's not terribly grotesque...but it may bother some people...after all, not all the deaths and attacks are humans running around with guns.  Some of them are done by ravenous dinosaur predators who are most definitely hungry.  Think Jurassic Park, but slightly more.  All in all, it really is a show that the family can watch together (older children...no need to give young ones nightmares).MOVING ON (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):Let me just lay this out there.  It is unfortunate that FOX decided to cancel this show.  I really don't know why, but they did.  That said, I hope someone will realize the untapped potential that the show has and pick it up sometime and finish it.  So what does this do to the plot and story.  Fortunately, the way that the narrative was told actually closes the story arc nicely.  I did feel content and complete...even though I knew that it is incomplete.  They graciously don't leave you with a complete cliff hangar (just an allusion to an unexplored territory that they would have explored if there was a 2nd season).  But anyways, I really loved this show because it feels fresh.  I'm not talking about ""uniqueness"" or ""originality""...but that a hopeful aura exists strongly with this one.  It shows you a family who is not perfect, but struggle together to overcome odds.  It shows you a nobility and heroism that can be found in humanity.  It also shows you that not all choices are black and white...but even with all the gray, there is still a right and wrong.  The importance of community and working together is an often explored theme...as well as a sense of honor.  Frankly, this really was a breath of fresh air.  The show was well paced and definitely was well organized.  While constantly progressing the storyline, you were able to witness different aspects of the Terra Nova village.  Everything was executed in a believable manner, and I was quite impressed with the characters...both main, supporting, and ""extras"".  They really captured a vibrant and beautiful world with this one.SPECIAL FEATURES:Aside from having all the possible available episodes, this set comes with many interesting and intriguing extras.  Deleted Scenes, mini-documentaires about the Dinosaurs and ""making of"" the pilot episode just to name a few.  They are standard extras, but fun to watch nonetheless.All in All, this is a welcome change of pace for television dramas.  It has a decent blend of action and character interaction, and a full and cohesive storyline.  Though unfortunately the show broadcast was cancelled, it still ties up nicely and with a certain amount of satisfaction that it doesn't feel terribly incomplete.  I say do yourself a favor and buy a copy.  There is much to interest you and many wonderful life lessons as well.",Terra Nova

Warwick Wilson seems to have come out of a Patricia Highsmith book, although with a funny twist.If you are looking for a comedy, parts of this film are funny, but this isn't really comedy. The same applies if you're looking for a thriller. Whatever it is, I think that David Hyde Pierce's representation of a character who is a role model in the public eye, but a complete psycho behind closed doors (a funny one, though), is the highlight of this film.If you're looking for a movie where all of it has to match, work according to reality and be feasible, watch another film.

The answer is so clearly exemplified in the movie Cabaret, which takes place in the decadent Berlin of the 1930s. Maximilian von Heune, the rich and bisexual German baron, so well played by Helmut Grime, summarized it so succinctly: ""Max observes to Brian (played by Michael York) that `The Nazis are just a bunch of stupid hooligans. ... Let them get rid of the Communists; later we'll be able to control them.' Brian then asked, `who's we?' To which Max added, `Germany.'""The movie as a whole is a snap picture of a beautiful and prosperous Nation, which recovered from a time ready to change for the worse.

Well, I'm here to tell you this film is not boring. It's excellent for young and old alike delivering a belly-laugh out-loud funny story throughout it's entirety. It's the perfect prequel to 2001 ""Monster's Inc."" telling us the story of how young monster's Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal), and James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman), met for the first time, butted heads, then became fast friends. There is a wonderful new monster character voiced by actress Helen Mirren, I must mention that scared me in a good way. She plays Dean Hardscrabble at Monster's University where Mike and Sulley are going to learn how to scare little human children. And when you see her, she will scare and intimidate you too! Remember...in a good way!Director Dan Scanlon whose credits include Disney~Pixar ""Cars"" (2006) and short film ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" (2006), has done a wonderful job creating an entertaining fun family film that everyone will love. He's also the writer for this film along with Daniel Gerson and Robert L. Baird, who must have all had a blast writing this enchanting funny script. Lucky talented men!""Monster's University"" fits perfectly in front of it's wonderful predecessor ""Monster's Inc."", ending where it begins.

Imagine, people digging where they shouldn't, wake up one nasty dragon (a bit peckish after a long sleep).  After that, dragons rule.  For some this might be considered a nightmare, for me it's a fun movie filled with great characters (standouts being Christian Bale, Gerard Butler, and Alice Krige in a brief but important role).  My favorite scene involves Bale & Butler putting on a stage play for the children.  There are fun moments and frantic moments.

794773,"With extraordinary staging, outstanding singing from all the leads, and the incomparable sound of Les Arts Florissants led by William Christie, what's not to love? So I thought, until I took the DVD for a spin.The poor quality of the audio recording throughout the performance is inexcusable. First, the stage is covered with sand (which works fine as stage craft); however, the sound recording manages to pick up a greatly amplified scrunch, scrunch, scrunch almost anytime a performer walks while singing. This loud scrunching of sand cuts right through the singing. This happens a lot throughout the production. Second, almost anytime a performer is not facing full on to the audience, the volume and clarity of the audio degrades drastically. These two audio problems spoil this DVD as a presentation of what is clearly a magnificent production. I've never come across an opera DVD with anything like these audio problems.Further, the video recording is spoiled by nearly every single close up starting off out of focus and then being corrected. If you ever want to realize just how many close ups there are in a recording of an opera, viewing this DVD will allow you to do that; they each stand out as an eye sore.What a terrible shame.So based on the utterly brilliant staging and costuming married to acting and singing of the very highest caliber of this 2003 Duplat/Christie production of Il ritorno, I had high expectations for the 2010 Pizzi/Christie production delivering all of that while correcting the issues with the audio and video recording. And it did eliminate the audio and video recording flaws. However, the newer production (2010 Pizzi/Christie) did not at all match the level of acting and singing delivered in this Duplat/Christie 2003 production. The wonderful touches with staging and costuming in Pizzi/Christie do not at all compensate for the wooden acting and the dull singing.Since viewing the 2010 production, I have gone back and again viewed the 2003 production several times. And I have decided that on balance the stellar singing, acting, and staging of Duplat/Christie far outweighs the flaws in audio and video recording on that DVD and place it much higher than the DVD of the Pizzi/Christie production. So I have gone back and upgraded my rating for the 2003 Duplat/ChristieIf you are deciding between the DVD for the 2003 Duplat/Christie and 2010 Pizzi/Christie productions, go with Duplat/Christie. If you are getting both, understand that there are flaws with the audio and video recording with the Duplat/Christie, but to get past these flaws give Duplat/Christie a second try after viewing the Pizzi/Christie production and the superior acting and singing in Duplat/Christie will shine through.",N/A
1505773,"This was definitely not what I expected.  It was much better.  Juno Temple, Jeremy Dozier, Milla Jovovich, William H. Macy, and Mary Steenburgen were fabulous in this eye-opening candid look at dysfunctional families and the destructive behavior it creates in the lives of the youngsters.  I was expecting a tongue-in-cheek comedy about the aches and pains of growing up...a genre I thoroughly enjoy a laugh from.  The film is highlighted by spectacular acting.  Juno is a diamond in the rough.  What a talent.  And her gay school buddy Jeremy Dozier is equally as effective.  I don't give away plots.  I just hand out kudos when deserved.  Yes, you'll laugh at the comedy.  Yes, you'll cringe at their behavior from time to time.  And yes, you'll shed a few tears as this unfolds into a LOUD statement of life in broken households.  I was laughing at myself for crying.  Does that make sense?  Then rent or get a copy of this fiick. It needs to be seen by the young and the old.  And don't let the DVD box fool you. It says in the rating box that there is graphic nudity.  There is not one single nude scene.  It is not needed and it would have taken away from development of characters.  I gave it a solid 10.  Juno Temple will someday be on the big stage as an Oscar nominee.  Once I saw this film, I ordered three more of hers in a starring role.  I can't wait to watch them.  What drew me to this film was Mary Steenburgen.  I saw &#34;Last Vegas' two week's ago and I was thoroughly impressed so I looked her up on the IMDB and started perusing her filmography.  This one struck a chord. I made a good choice.  But I CAUTION you.  It does contain profanity and some sick dialogue at the beginning.  But it fits the role(s) of the cast.  This is not a film for people who look down upon same-sex relationships.  However, I'd recommend it to those who don't understand L-O-V-E.

1634437,"When producer Shaun Carrigan offered me the opportunity to review ""Tell it on the Mountain,"" I watched the five-minute preview and was immediately hooked into viewing the two-hour film. Not since David Breashears' 1998 film ""Everest"" have I seen a film that so perfectly combined spectacular landscapes with a compelling human interest story. The 2,600-mile Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) traverses some of the most remote and rugged terrain in the United States, and the cinematography captured this wilderness in all its glory, but the real story was about the so-called ""thru-hikers"" who gave up the comforts of home to face a grueling 5-month trek from the Mexican border to the Canadian border. The film focused on several of these-hikers as they braved the harsh terrain, weather - from sizzling 100+ degrees in the desert to near-zero temperatures in the high mountain passes, poisonous snakes and scorpions, oxygen deprivation at altitudes of 13,000 feet, deep snows that required crampons and ice axes, narrow trails on steep mountainsides, crossing swiftly-flowing rivers swollen from spring rains and snowmelt, and even forest fires.The thru-hikers in the film were a varied lot, but all had a common goal: to make it to the end of the trail. One incredibly dedicated fellow pushed himself to the absolute limit to hike to Canada, then turn around and hike back to the beginning of the trail at the Mexican border (called a ""yo-yo"" hike). Along the trail, one engaged couple planned to marry, then honeymoon by completing the hike. Another couple's plans to thru-hike the PCT was threatened by a serious medical problem. My favorite hiker was George ""Billygoat"" Woodard, a grizzled 66-year-old veteran of the PCT. At an age when many men his age are comfortably retired and taking life easy, he still lived for his time on the trail.The cinematography of the breathtaking landscapes was superb, and the use of handheld cameras for much of the footage gave an intimacy with the hikers that felt like being there with them on the trail, sharing the hardships and pain that they endured. For anyone contemplating hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, or just portions of it (""section-hikers""), this is a must-see film. For the rest of us, it's a mesmerizing two-hour documentary film that shouldn't be missed.",Tell It On The Mountain DVD - Tales From The Pacific Crest Trail
1399130,"I grew up wanting to be a lawyer as a kid. I grew up watching perhaps the best show of the 1990s, easily the best show in the drama category of that decade-The Practice, followed by its spin-off Boston Legal, as an adult. But I didn't think I'd be as interested in this movie, probably because watching a lawyer on film is different from watching one on television. But I gave it a shot. I won't exhaust you with the details of the storyline or criticize Matthew Mcconaughey (which seems to be a popular thing to do), given that there are over a thousand reviews of this movie, but I will briefly say, this is a film about a lawyer whose client turns out to be something he initially suspected and they take turns outdoing one another, which has fatal consequences.I agree with those who gave this film a 3-star rating.

Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is a muscle headed body builder who is inspired in ironic fashion by unorthodox motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong). With the aid of two other body builders, Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) they devise a plan to kidnap and extort money from Colombian businessman Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub).They fumble their way through the operation and become greedy. It is clear these guys were not bright. The writers created dialouge for these crooks in order to lighten the story and to keep them from looking like complete idiots. Fictional aspects such as making the nurse (Rebel Wilson) look heavy-set with portraying Doorbal as liking those type of women kept the story from becoming dry.The beginning of the film demonstrates some humor as Danny names fictional characters as his heroes...&#34;There are no shortcuts to the American dream&#34; he proclaims.

If you've seen all of them (now patiently waiting for the Season 6 premiere on 7/14/13), you know that this show is non-stop action, drama, and suspense.  Slight spoiler alert - Walt White (a.k.a. Heisenberg) has definitely taken a turn for the better in forms of being 'the king' of the crystal meth business, but in return, his family life is quickly going down the drain. While watching 'Breaking Bad,' I've seen this character evolve into something that I never would've thought possible (especially after the shocking revelation on the end of Season 4).  Just seeing how he looks by the time he reaches his 52nd birthday in the first five minutes of the first episode of Season 5 (a 'in the future' scene), you just know that 'Heisenberg' has been through some truly dark and bleak times.  I don't want to spoil it completely, but I will say that it is worth your time to see the eight episodes in this season; can't wait for these four months to pass - I'm more excited to see the first episode of S6 than 'Iron Man 3'.

1592905,"When I first saw it, I have to admit, I was put off by the high voice.  For some reason, I had it in my head that one of the most characteristic traits of Lincoln was his deep sonorous voice.How did I get that impression?  Grade school indoctrination, perhaps.  Perhaps envisioning those powerfully worded speeches being delivered simply cast them in an authoritatively deep voice in my mind.  Further research indicates that this tall, lanky man was indeed a tenor.So, I have to get past that, which is harder than it should be.But, I think even that superficial misperception underscores how difficult it is to really understand the uncertainties of that period of American history.  We can look back after it's all settled and nod our heads, but how it would all turn out was a much bigger question in the day it was happening.The portrayal focuses on the slavery issue, but the real issue to Lincoln was the preservation of the union, which he was willing to enforce at any cost - including suspending the constitution and ignoring the fact that the southern states had ratified the constitution only with the proviso that they could secede.  Slavery was secondary (he certainly was vehemently opposed to it), and was adopted enthusiastically late in the war - mainly as a propaganda to maintain public support for a conflict that had dragged out much longer and become much more vicious than anyone had anticipated.We like to think of the ultimate outcome of the war as the abolition of slavery, but perhaps a more pernicious outcome was centralization of power in the federal government - a centralization that has continued to expand to proportions that extend into almost every aspect of life, today, and has for all intents and purposes usurped the sovereignty of the states.  An expansion that is increasingly accepted and even desired by a population with much different expectations of the nature and role of government from that of the 1860's.The interaction between Lincoln and Mary is explored interestingly, but how accurately is anyone's guess.Bears more analysis, I think.",N/A
1661334,"Halloween is right around the corner, and what better thing to do then t review the latest horror film hitting the silver screen. Wait? There aren't any new horror in theaters. What kind of Halloween season is this? Well be that as it may, I suppose the next best thing to do is see what hitting the shelves; and there just so happens be a particular horror name hitting dvd/blu-ray front.This icon has not been seen since 2004, but the killer doll Chucky lives again in the direct-to-dvd film : Curse of Chucky. The studio behind the Child's Play franchise thought it would be best to reboot the series, but in the end, they decided to bring everyone's favorite killer doll to the small screen; but does this new film revitalized the 80's horror classic?For those who are wondering, Curse of Chucky is a sequel to Seed of Chucky (don't worry, the film doesn't talk about that movie). Anyways, one day a mysterious package arrives at the door of the handicapped Nica and her mother Sara. When Sara is killed in the night, Nica's sister and her family arrive to handle Sara's affair. During their stay, Sara's daughter Alice befriends what was in the box, and that was a doll named Chucky; and where Chucky is, chaos is sure to follow.Though this film is a direct-to-DVD, the story is a good continuation to Child's Play. My only gripe with the plot is how it is handled. The story itself is interesting, but the pacing is too quick. It felt like I was watching a short film found online. Yet, what the story lacks in pacing it makes up in intrigue. Curse of Chucky's story bring the series full circle; something I never expect to see in a movie like this.For a horror film, Curse of Chucky was surprising in its characters and performances. Fiona Dourif certainly stole the show as Nica. Fiona played a different kind of horror protagonist, and I hope we see more of these characters in the future. The other show stealer was none other then Fiona's father, Brad Dourif, who reprises his role as Chucky. He may not have had a lot of lines; but hearing Brad as Chucky is nothing but nostalgic as the character has not lost his muster. While the rest of the cast was not as strong as the Dourifs, Curse of Chucky still has an impressive ensemble; or at least these characters had a purpose for being in this movie. It is step from what we see in so many horror films these days.I've never been a fan of straight-to-dvd content (unless the film has DC Comics attached to it), but I have to say the quality of Curse of Chucky is worthy of the silver screen. While the cinematography is simple, it still effective capturing the horror that Child's Play was known for. Speaking of horror, while you can see most of the scares coming, there is an atmosphere to Curse of Chucky; which only helps the jump scares.In horror film, we often looks at the scenes that frighten us. Yet in the case of this film, I think the best scene was the dinner sequence. This scene did not rely on scares, but suspense as Chucky put rat poison in the chili and you wondered who the lucky person going home dead.While I'm not a major fan of direct-to-dvd films, I have to tip my hat to Curse of Chucky. Rather then feeling like the filmmakers were trying to get a quick buck, the movie felt like legitimate horror film worthy of the Chucky franchise. While there are some issues with the movie, Curse of Chucky is still a must see for any fan of the series.Also read the review here: [...]",N/A

Though I do agree, you should verify that you are getting the genuine, official Paramount release if you shelling out the cash for this set.I'm not going to bother reviewing individual episodes of this series as that would drag this review out far too long. There are a few excellent episodes, and a few really lousy ones, and a whole bunch of enjoyable ""good"" episodes. With that said, I think I would recommend ""Voyager"" to any newbie interested in dipping their toe into Trek waters.The basic premise of the series is that the small-ish starship Voyager is sent on a 3-week mission to stop a terrorist cell of Maquis rebels who have been raising hell around an area of space known as the badlands. While in pursuit of a Maquis ship, both the terrorists and Voyager are pulled from the badlands into a distant region of space known as the Delta Quadrant.By the end of the first episode the Maquis and the Starfleet personnel are thrown together on Voyager and have a seventy-five year journey home ahead of them. A long journey home, through unexplored space actually fulfilling the premise layed out in the original series, ""Going where no one has gone before"".I know that Voyager has a somewhat ""uneven"" reputation among Trek fans, and while I tend to agree that it's not the best Trek series, I think it is the best series to introduce someone new to the universe.The Original Series is great, but very dated. The sets, costumes & creatures will make it difficult for any new fan to take seriously. TNG is an excellent series, and probably my second choice as a good intro into this universe, but TNG doesn't really hit it's stride until season 3, and the first couple of seasons are a chore to get through. Deep Space Nine is probably my favorite Trek series, but if I'm introducing a newbie to Trek, they most likely want to see starships ""trekking"" through space. Enterprise, which I enjoy also, suffers from the same thing TNG offers up, a really rough first season, and while the second season is better, Archer and crew don't really hit their stride until season 3.""Voyager"" pretty much hits the ground running, the premise doesn't really waiver from the first episode onward. We get tons of new aliens, and because Voyager is so far removed from home, it's reliance on previous Trek events is minimal. ""Voyager"" introduces the mission of Starfleet in a very accessible manner. Viewers can see the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of a Starfleet run ship right along with the Maquis crew members, and it's a perfect introduction to the Trek universe.I'm working my way through the series for a third time now, and have to say that ""Voyager"" catches a lot of heat for what it didn't do, but not enough praise for what it does right. If you only remember ""Voyager"" for things like ""Threshold"", or Seven-of-Nine in her catsuit, give the show another chance. Sure it has it's flaws, but I think if you go back and re-watch ""Voyager"" again, you'll be pleasantly surprisd.",N/A

Which don't get me wrong the explosions and gunfire are great very intense and entertaining. Bottom line is the rock is a movie any action fan should enjoy.,The Rock VHS
1549971,"""Nobody lives Forever"" is a 1946 black and white romantic crime drama starring John Garfield, Walter Brennan, and Geraldine Fitzgerald with George Tobias, George Coulouris, and Faye Emerson. Based on an original screenplay by famed crime writer W.R.Burnett (""Little Caesar"", ""Beast of the City"", ""High Sierra"", ""This Gun for Hire"", ""Asphalt Jungle"", Scarface"") the story centers on a group of grifters, one of whom (Garfield) fall in love with his mark (Fitzgerald), much to the dismay of his fellow gangsters (Coulouris).Ruggedly handsome John Garfield (1913-52) was the original ""method"" actor. Garfield made his screen debut in 1938 in ""Four Daughters"" for which he received his first Best Supporting  Actor nomination. One year later ""They Made me a Criminal"" propelled him into the A list. He's best known for ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946). Blacklisted in the communist scare of the early 50s, his career was cut short, and he died in 1952 at age 39. This film comes at the height of his popularity and it was his chance to show a wider range of acting skill, which he does.Beautiful Geraldine Fitzgerald (1913-2005) plays the rich widow whom Garfield intends to fleece. She's best known for her Oscar nominated role in ""Wuthering Heights"" (1939)Walter Brennan (1894-1974) plays Garfield's old friend. Brennan won 3 Oscars for Best Supporting Actor  -""Come and Get it"" (1936), ""Kentucky"" (1938), and ""The Westerner"" (1941) - and was nominated for his work in ""Sergeant York"" (1941). We know him best for his Emmy nominated role in the TV series ""The Real McCoys"", and his film comedies (""The Over the Hill Gang"") or as the grumpy side kick Stumpy in ""Rio Bravo"", but he was equally capable of playing the villain, as he showed in ""The Westerner"" (1940), ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and again In ""How the West Was Won"" (1962).George Tobias (1901-1980) plays the comic relief sidekick. He appeared in more than 50 films including ""The Strawberry Blonde"" (1941), ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (1942), and ""Passage to Marseille"" (1944). Like many other film actors, he transitioned to TV in the 50s and is best remembered for his comedy as the witch Samantha's neighbor Abner on ""Bewitched"" (1964-71).Glamorous Faye Emerson (1917-1983) achieved her fame on TV in the 50s, but she had an active film career and worked with Garfield in films like ""Between Two Worlds"" (1944) and ""Out of the Fog"" (1941). She plays Garfield's ex-girlfriend.This was the fifth film for director Jean Negulesco (1900-93) who went on to earn an Oscar nomination for ""Johnny Belinda"" (1955) and win a BAFTA for ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" (1959). He specialized in films that take place in Europe (""Three Coins in a Fountain"", ""Boy on a Dolphin"", ""Britannia Mews"") and also was known for his atmospheric use of the camera - neither of which are present here.The film is often referred to as ""film noir"" which it clearly isn't. There is no femme fatale (although Emerson's role had the potential) and there is no downbeat ending. The big city backdrop is substituted for the beaches of Malibu, and the sunshine replaces the dark rainy street scenes.Bottom line - an OK film from the mid 40s, with a good performance from John Garfield.",N/A

1275318,"I bought seasons 1-3 recently because I LOVE this show. Never saw seasons 4 and 5, so I got them from the library. Glad I did (and this review is NO reflection on Amazon or its PERFECT service for me to date) Season 4 was fantastic. Season five started off okay, but sank quickly. Like the last seasons of Smallville and Charmed, it was like the writers were all killed in a tragic train crash...and the custodians were called in to quick-finish the series. What's with the purple-haired dike and the watered down dialogues of Rikki and the cleverly-inserted daughter? I started fast-forwarding through the purple-hair scenes and finally quit 4 shows before Season 5 ended. Too much damage for a recovery. Even the music was overall ineffectively interjected and not as effective as prior seasons (except Todd Rundgren's ""We Gotta Get You a Woman""). It was a sad finish...but that's just my take.

1358807,"""She-Ra"" was really just ""He-Man"" with the genders reversed.  Still, it spoke to me back in my junior high days.  My little sister especially loved the show.  This episode was told in flashback.  It's basically the introduction of Castaspella.The more I watch the Smurfs, She-Ra, and other cartoons, the more I realize how derivative they are.  The evil queen in this episode was like the one in Disney's Snow White.  Her hair was covered and she had a seductive look.  Like the Witch in the Wizard of Oz, water played a role in her downfall.  Castaspella is like a reversal of the evil queen in Snow White.  That queen went from a vamp to an old peddler woman of her own free will.  Castaspella starts off as an old woman cursed by the queen and then becomes pretty and young.For people interested in She-Ra toys, it turns out that the Castaspella on TV look different from the doll.  On TV, her colors are blue and yellow.  The doll has shades of yellow.  The toy has a sunlike aura on her torso's back.  Castaspella on TV never has a glow or glimmer behind her.Like many a cartoon, here good conquers evil.

1447548,"As a huge fan of Damages I have clung to every episode like an addict awaiting my fix. This show hit the ground running- it was intense and addicting from the very first shot in which the elevator doors open and out stumbles our protagonist Ellen, the poor weak little waif who wanders out the door and into our tv world plus into the world of antagonist sociopath Patty who, by the way, makes Alex Forrest from &#34;Fatal Attraction&#34; look like Mother Theresa.I think I totally marathon-watched every single ep for not just the first season but also the second and third within probably a week. I was that hooked. Then for some reason the FX channel dropped it (probably b/c it didn't have enough profanity and borderline porn that their other shows offer) and I had to retrieve seasons four and five from the internet. As with Mad Men's 5th season which also came after an unexpected delay I found the series had declined. The characters are still riveting but the writing just didn't generate much interest with its plots and storylines which used to be full of twists. The genius of the first three seasons just seems to have bailed out of the fourth and fifth seasons.(Since season five is not here to review I'm gonna comment on both of the last two seasons.) The plot in season four is just not as interesting. The same can be said of season five. Only season five is worse. Everything bad about season four is doubled in season five really. Both seasons show too much flashing back- in season four, it is within the season- they keep showing the same scenes repeated over and over. In season five, they keep showing either dreams recurring over and over or they show flashbacks from the first, second and third seasons. Season five also consists of a lot of shots of Ryan Phillipe's naked butt as he bangs various chicks. Then there are various scenes that drag on and on while the viewer waits for something ANYTHING to happen. For example, Patty and Ellen are stranded in a Maine airport during a snowstorm. I thought something good was gonna happen but the only &#34;excitement&#34; that occurred was when Patty broke in to the liquor cabinet. WHOA!!! The whole episode practically was devoted to the two women sitting in an airport munching on crackers from the vending machine. It's actually even less exciting than I'm making it out to be. They could have added some shots of the paint chipping off the walls and that might've helped!Both seasons were very slow and too convoluted. What really made the show exciting during the first three seasons was not only the great characters but also the fast-paced movement of the show- it didn't wait for you. During the first three years, from the minute each season started it was like an adrenaline rush to see each new episode and find out what was gonna happen. It was exciting. I got so many people hooked on Damages in the beginning. EVERYONE loved it. Sadly, though, all good things must come to an end. I'm sure it's dfficult to maintain that kind of stamina year after year. So if you are a fan of the show (at least for the first three seasons) but debated about whether or not to purchase seasons four and five, beware that the two final seasons may not live up to the standard set by the previous three. They are still better than like 95% of the crap on tv now but just don't get your hopes up.Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are still amazing in their roles and the guest stars add a lot as well- John Goodman in season four and Ryan Phillipe in season five. But performances are not enough to save a failing show. As I said, all these good shows eventually start to decline- I loved the first few seasons of Mad Men as well as Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy but all have just lost their luster in my opinion. I wish I had better news- I believe as with Mad Men that I am in the minority when I say the show isn't as good but that's fine. I'm glad some people still like the shows. However, I see from other reviews that it's not just me. Whatever... people are entitled to their opinions and I'm sure people who vehemently support a show no matter how bad it gets will certainly express that. But I'm just trying to be helpful to those people who, as I said above, may be debating about watching/purchasing seasons four and five. To them I say: get them off the internet or from Net- -flix but save your money if you were thinking of buying them.",Damages: Season 4
1355766,"A dull supernatural series that gives Boris Karloff the chance to show that regardless of the plot, and how weak the dialogue is, that he could still show up for work.Some of the stories reminded me of Twilight Zone (1959 TV series), or Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955) while others reminded me of the Outer Limits (1963 TV series). In other words, they didn't have any fresh initiative or original feel of mysteries, thrillers or dramas.The entire Thriller series was so poorly done: low production values, weak story lines, abundant logic flaws (and that's taking the specific genre into account).Overall, not a big fan of Karloff but that is because I think stranding him on a dull supernatural series for years stuck in one genre was a big mistake and it didn't allow him to be a proper actor.Recommended only for the selfish people who love Karloff blindly since they won't listen to any objection if they're in love with crappy old anthologies or simply looking for past, stuffy nostalgia.All others avoid and save yourself the hefty money, this set isn't worth it.I'll be selling my advanced Thriller promo copy that I sat to watch for 2 long, dull weeks.",N/A

1481292,"I say ""kind of"" because this movie more acknowledges the first movie than it does follow it.  It kept the main ending plot point of Zartan taking over the presidency from the first film, and expanded on the Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow story a bit, but aside from that almost everything was different.  Most of the main cast from the first movie were not brought back.  That is not such a bad thing in the case of Marlon Wayans, but it is when talking about Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Eccleston.  Although they did leave open the possibility of bringing Destro back in what will inevitably be another movie in the franchise.The highlight of the film (as it was in the first one) were the martial arts sequences involving Ray Park and Byung Hun Lee.  Sometimes they were fighting each other, sometimes together, and sometimes on their own.  Wire work and special effects aside, they steal the show every time.  The mountain top ninja fight about halfway through the movie is worth the price.  The additions of Adrianne Palicki and D.J. Cotrona as Lady Jaye and Flint were fine, The Rock was pretty much his standard action hero persona, and Ray Stevenson as the other main bad guy Firefly was also very good.  Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis had what amounted to expanded cameo roles but were not around for long.You pretty much know what you get going into a movie like this.  A lot of action, shoot-em-up explosions and martial arts.  The movie looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray.  The special features are pretty standard, but nothing to write home about.  Chances are if you like the first one you will like this one.  Unless of course you are one who absolutely hate the idea of the cast turn over and abandoning much of the story from the first movie.  If you hate that idea or are just not a fan of the genre in general, then skip this.  Otherwise, it is worth a couple hours of your time if you are in the mood to watch an action movie.",N/A

1484669,"I'm an enormous fan of Burton's earlier stuff, and Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my all-time favorite movies. But, other than Sweeney Todd, his later work has been leaving me kind of cold. I love monster movies, and I caught every reference in this film, and I wanted to like it. I really did want to. I just didn't. It was kind of boring.I had the same problem with this that I had with Corpse Bride, which is that his characters are designed so that they never really look all that interested in what's going on around them. They don't seem affected, which makes it hard for me to care about what's going on either. I get that this isn't using real actors, but this isn't something that affected Nightmare Before Christmas, where the characters showed actual emotion. But here it seems like we get a couple tears pooling and that's it. The rest of it is strangely monotone.Also, the monsters in the second half were kind of scary for a kid's movie. Assuming this was a kid's movie. It was marketed that way, and it isn't terribly complex, which makes me think it can't possibly be for adults. But it's seems too scary for kids under seven or eight. I think the cat metamorphosing into a half-bat winged creature with claws that then scuttled around the room lightening fast only to try to attack people is a little much for kids under that age. And it's going to be too slow for most kids over eleven or twelve. If it is meant for kids, that leaves Burton a very narrow audience. If he meant to aim for adults, well, he underestimated his viewers' level of sophistication.The movie simply seemed bland, even curiously boring. Burton probably got a lot of people through the door based on the trailer, which was far more interesting than the actual movie, but the audience likely to really enjoy this movie seems small. And for the first time since Corpse Bride, I just wasn't in it.",N/A

135453,"One of the great travesties in movie history is that Dustin Hoffman didn't win the Oscar for best actor for his incredible performance in this picture.  Voigt delivers a fine performance as well as the lead actor/title character, but Dustin's acting is so deep, nuanced and rich that I always just shake my head whenever I watch his Ratso Rizzo.  He uses a spot on New York accent, affects a very convincing cripple's walk, displays manual dexterity cooking and shining shoes.  He convincingly portrays someone who is very sick, a con man, someone w/ a big heart, a dreamer and someone who truly loves his counterpart, Joe Buck.  When you seem him sweating profusely w/ the fear in his eyes that he's dying, you absolutely believe it.There's a lot to recommend this film, but you'll never see a finer acting performance than what you get out of Dustin here.",N/A

The best thing about these two are the subtle things, the animation placed atop Eva's laugh thrilling for adventure with Bob's panic filled voice, playing the straight man, even as a mouse.

Andy Griffith + Christmas should = GREAT, but this turned out to be a low budget made for TV snooze fest. We love Andy Griffith and were hoping to add to our annual Christmas viewing list of must watches but we won't be watching this one again. Andy was the main reason we bought this plus the fact that Netflix does not carry it plus it had so many raving reviews and high ratings here on Amazon. Turns out this is boring lame story w/ lousy acting. While it did have a couple of okay moments, this movie could have been so much better. It is hard to pin point. Maybe it was the uninteresting story or the bad script or the reality that Naoimi Judd is not a very good actress or all the little things like the fact that trees in Kentucky don't have leaves in December nor do you drive a convertible in December in Kentucky, just to name a few. My wife kept looking at me while we watched this saying ""this is really cheesy"" and ""why did you buy this""???Andy Griffith fans may want to pass on this one and know that he isn't even the main character. The main actors are Naomi ""Dudd"" and some little angry troubled brat(whose singing voice is not so good). Do buy this if you are a Naomi fan. For everyone else, my advice, save your and money wait for this to come to Netflix(and the drink a lot of coffee; otherwise, you may fall asleep...). My 3 stars rating is being kind.

Who tried to stop the trip to the moon and why?  Who coughed up the court order forbidding the takeoff and why?).  I found it disappointing that they threw out all these potential plot developments only to dismiss them as quickly as they were brought up.  They could have added some much needed excitement to an otherwise dry presentation.  Thank goodness there was plenty of comic relief courtesy of Dick Wesson (as the conscripted member of the trip to the moon).I especially loved the use of an old scare tactic, brought up in a rant, that we needed to take possession of the moon in order to keep &#8216;someone else&#8217; from getting there first and lobbing missiles at us from a base &#8216;they&#8217; could set up there.

Remember that Domingo's cousin was surnamed KOYAMA.Note the thin SEMITIC character who shrugs ""it's a living"" referring to his salvage business.  Get it?  SALVAGE work in the  Konzentrationslager, or KZ.And in Giancarlo's unforgettable scene at Casa Tranqillo, you will be reminded of Arnold Schwarzenegger inThe Terminator.This show is instrumental in directing our attention or at least a glance at the Wikipedia page at Nazi-era nuke scientist Werner Heisenberg who PROBABLY had something to do with U-864 (Hitler's Last Deadly Secret). As impressive as Walter White's intellect is, Heisenberg was even smarter which means the British saved the world when they sank the U-Boat containing two Japanese scientists trained in Germany and the components for the A bomb headed for Japan.

Then the sequel in 2004The Chronicles of Riddickleft me hugely disappointed, bored and disenchanted with the Riddick character and film franchise. But 2013's Riddick film redeems the character, the franchise, and it has me right back where I was 13 years ago after watching Pitch Black for the dozenth time: hoping for a sequel!In this flick, Riddick is abandoned on a desolate planet and back fighting some sick looking monsters to survive....The most vicious being the scorpion-like Mud Demons. So when Riddick realizes that major approaching rain storms will turn the planet to mud...well let's just says that you don't want to be on a muddy planet that's infested with Mud Demons. So Riddick's only hope is to make his presence on the planet known to intergalactic bounty hunters by setting off an emergency beacon. When the bounty hunters arrive looking to kill versus capture Riddick, he's got his work cut out to figure out a way off the planet alive.The movie gets an R, but (once again) I think the MPAA got it wrong and should have given it a PG-13. I watched the Unrated version, and sure there's some gore, but no more than you might see in some TV-MA shows these days likeThe Walking Dead.

1509067,"As a child, I remember loving this show, along with the other classics of the late 1950s and 1960s. Although too young to remember some of them, I was old enough to remember Hazel. The show revolves around the adventures of this extraordinary Housekeeper/Maid and her uncanny ability to always make things turn out right. The family consists of ""Mr. B"" the attorney and head of the family, although if truth be known, I always felt Hazel was the one in charge. Missy, George's wife, has known Hazel since she was a child and is the perfect complement to her husband. An interior decorator with excellent taste, she and Hazel have a very loving relationship and Missy can be counted on to run interference when Hazel and Mr. B butt heads. Then there is the adorable Harold, better known as ""Sport,"" who is such a sweet little boy who worships Hazel and considers her a hero. The acting is superb and the storylines are anything but sappy. This series proves that wholesome programs have a place in society and with it, there is always a valuable lesson to be learned. Kudos to Shirley Booth, Don DeFore, Whitney Blake and Bobby Buntrock for delivering a beautiful and entertaining story to the viewers in every episode.

1656062,"I liked the themes presented in this movie. They are morally valid, deeply felt and deeply convincing. It's just, I'm an adult. Not a twelve year old. And I guess that's the audience eliott and rossio are going for, aside from toggling to adult audiences on occasion in the narrative. The feel of the movie was theme ride along with &#34;western movie trope recycling,&#34; everything from &#34;The great train robbery&#34; to &#34;Once upon a time in the west&#34; to &#34; a few dollars more&#34; to the silent movies where the heroine is tied to the railroad tracks by the Evil Villein and it is the hero's job to rescue her. this, of course is all new for those who've never seen. Lastly, the point by the other reviewer of partial native american descent is taken- the story of genocide is always disturbing, always a rent in the fabric of the continuing tale of humanity. To have it represented in the form of cartoon villeins is, well, good for a twelve year old. To have it depicted as the overwhelming truth about the west, well, I wasn't there, so I can't say. It does smack of a simplistic interpretation. Maybe it's true.

1176153,"I just finished watching both Winds of War and then War and Remembrance back to back. I have a completely different opinion of both projects with the first mini series getting better reviews than the last one.Overall, the writing was odd. The words were like something out of a 1930 movie. The way the males in the series talked to the females. Very mechanical and so respectful and proper. The affairs of the main characters, Pug and his wife, were so sterile. Even when his wife confronted Pug's mistress (if you call her that) it was just too polite.Also, I think the first mini series was shot just as Robert Mitchum was reaching his apex as a leading man. Then a few years later, he was older and much stiffer. All of the shots of him had him walking in standing and walking out. That isn't to take away from his presence, which he had plenty of, but to underscore that his character was supposed to be a Navy Captain in his prime. Clearly he was too old for the part and it showed.I also didn't like all the character recasting that the second mini series did. When you watch these back to back, the characters don't make sense when you are dealing with a new face. I think originally, when the two series were separated over many years, the viewing audience was not a familiar with the old cast and more forgiving. Back to back viewings probably not so much.I also really got sick of the thick British sayings. ""Indeed, By-Jove, Cherri o, etc. I did a little research and most of those sayings are rare, but not extinct in England. I think it is representative of the writer's impression of the English and not so much the reality of their slang.The best performance in both series was Ralph Bellamy as FDR. He made FDR come to life and played the part with conviction. The others got too old and they just waited too long to shoot the sequel.It is worth the viewing. I love WWII history and this provided some historical perspectives but there was far too many literally manipulations to take most of it serious. It was entertaining but could bog down if you tried to watch it back to back to back. Take a break between episodes and you will enjoy it much more.",War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-Series

1191408,"End of the world movies can generally be categorized into one of three categories.  The first is the zombie scenario, which is probably the most popular in terms of ticket sales and advertising.  Examples of this genre including everything from action thrillers like World War Z, to gory horror flicks like the Resident Evil franchise, to comedies like ZombieLand.  The second category are the alien invasion movies.  Here we have films like Skyline, Storage 24, Oblivion, and others of this kind.  Then there is everything else, few of which see much success.  A good example of the latter is ""The Road"" which came out in 2009.  Set in a near future where smoky fires cloud the skies yet rain and gloom cover the earth, the film seems set in a USA after a nuclear war has disabled the infrastructure of modern technology.  The plot follows a man and his son who travel westward to the Pacific Ocean hoping to find any community to live with.  Along the way they meet cannibals, criminals, and other refugees.  The father dreams about his past, life before the catastrophe, and shortly thereafter up to and including the birth of their son.  There is also a long running dialogue between father and son about good and evil, and whether they count as good people versus some of the evil people they have met.  The overall mood of the movie is somber, grim, and dark.  Compared to other end of the world movies, this would classify more as a drama with only the occasional scene of action or suspense.  I myself found it hard to stay focused, and would not bother watching it again.",N/A

872238,"When I watched We Need to Talk about Kevin I was interested in stories in a similar vein and a friend recommended ""The Child I Never Was"" to me.  Let that be a lesson to all of us when you find yourself being recommended a movie that is a little strange no some research first I really wish I had at least checked out the amazon views. At least ""We Need To Talk about Kevin"" is a fictional story.  Considering the title of the film I would imagine the object was to explain some of the motivations and make the audience sympathize with Bartsch or at least attempt to understand why he did what he did.  I'm sorry I just don't buy it I understand that serial killers are the exception to the rule in a civilized society but lots of people were unloved as children and others suffer from some manner of sexual kink that they learn to control.Two main things also confuse meSo much time is spent telling Bartsch's side of the story that his victims barely get a footnote on one level this is understandable but when you are listening to the gruesome details of what the killer did to his targets I felt that we owed the victims at least the cliff notes version of their life.I also don't know who is in charge of making the list for Amazon but to see this lumped with the Gay films is actually more shocking to me then the film itself.  This is not a Gay film if you are feeling charitable this is a true crime film now this probably is due to the fact that Gay cinema is small in comparison to most other branches of cinema but in most other examples I can think of no one commits a murder.",Child I Never Was

141722,"Thief is one of Michael Mann's great early crime drama efforts. When I say the film is 'gritty' I don't mean that the movie deals with tough subject matter, I mean the actual film is gritty and unrefined. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, while the movie is not Heat, it did provide a great stepping stone for Michael Mann to get to his opus that is Heat. The best thing about this movie is undoubtedly Jimmy Caan. His character is one tough SOB and a protagonist to be rivaled with few in the genre. He doesn't take any crap from anybody. This is one of the best heist movies you could ever see and with the stylized direction it really embodies the early 1980's. The final scene of the film is one of the greatest badass moments in cinema.",Thief

1610488,"Casino Royale was finally filmed and acted out the way it should have been.  It was exciting, well written and plotted and acted gorgeously.  Eva Green was wonderful and beautiful as the doomed love of Bond's life and you could feel Craig's sorrow and hurt when he realizes that he had been betrayed.  Of course Judi Dench was marvelous as usual.  Mads Mikelsohn was a marvel as the villain and he played it with a slick, sick verve.  Loved this film.Quantum of Solace is not everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoyed it far more than the longer films.  Quantum was gritty, dirty and down right real leaving out all of the gadgetry and eye candy with the exception of the all too real Olga Kurylenko, the only Bond heroine who was on equal footing with Bond and didn't sleep with him.  Her character had an agenda, just as  Bond had an agenda and together they formed an alliance that turned out to be unbeatable.  The film was only something like 1 hour and 45 minutes long, but it was never dull, boring, or stupid and hit all of its marks.Skyfall - this is a tough one.  I hated it on the first viewing because this one required you to be on your toes and to pay attention and think.  Also, I was very tired that day and, although I was excited to get to see it on it's first showing, I fell asleep for a good 45 minutes to an hour so I woke not knowing what had gone after it started and I fell asleep and woke again to find that Bond and M are on the run.  I finally streamed it on Vudu and, boy was I surprised at what a great film this was.  I have watched it several times and have great respect for the making of this installment.  My one big complaint was Berenice (whatever her last name) is being in the film so damned briefly.  She was so damned beautiful and exotic.  No Bond beauty has ever been this gorgeous and she was in and out of the film in a minute and I didn't know why or what she had done that angered the villain.  Of course Javier Bardem was wonderful as usual.  Also, when they tie all the characters into their Ian Fleming created character slots at the end that was brilliant.This is a very good collection for the money, however, Quantum of Solace is still my favorite or the three.  I love good film noir and this fit the bill.  The other two I will say are brilliant companions but without the story in Quantum of Solace, you couldn't tie the other two together.

1538029,"Forget the plot in this movie. I got this video mainly for its 3D effects. Most 3D videos are simply 2D to 3D convertibles and so are not much better than the 2D original. It's just another way for the studios to gouge the consumers by charging extra for them. This one is different and is comparable to Avatar. If you like 3D effects and action stuff, get this movie. Forget the plot. Extremely convoluted and confusing.On a different note, I have a bone to pick with Amazon.com.  Bought this Bluray from Amazon.com, not a 3rd party seller, mind you. Amazon.com has dropped its price since initial purchase, but they won't refund me the difference because they only have a 7-day price match policy. Makes absolutely no sense to me. I'm still within the 30-day return period, so actually I can send the disc back and re-order it at a lower price. Amazon.com really dropped the ball on this one. They're collecting taxes now and only have a 7-day price match when most brick and mortar stores in my area (and probably every where else) have a 30-day price guarantee. Extremely disappointed with them. Probably never buy from them again. They're collecting taxes and have a shorter price guarantee. There's no advantage to buying from Amazon.com any more.

For that reason, I think this is a workout more appropriate to a low intermediate exerciser than an advanced exerciser. I have a lot of shorter workouts that do a lot more in less time, so regretfully I had to knock off two stars for that reason only.  However, I did find the initial standing exercises to be very unique and quite a balance challenge. This is also an enjoyable, no-dread core workout and that says a lot since I don't usually enjoy core work.  Leah's movements have a lovely, dancer-like flow and elegance to them.  Truly a quality instructor!The production quality is simple but pretty. Leah is in a ballet studio with violet lighting. Leah also carefully chose special music, which is a relief next to the mass producers who usually use generic, elevator sounding music.

243539,"Handily one of my favorite Carpenter flicks. Somewhat goofy and overwrought with physics and technical mumbo jumbo, the film still packs a punch with its frightening visuals and unsettling story, which revolves around the discovery of an ancient liquid filled canister that contains Satan himself in the basement of a church. If you haven't seen this film, I can honestly tell you that it's one of Carpenter's best and contains one of the creepiest bits of video footage this side of ""The Ring"".That being said, this Blu Ray rerelease comes courtesy of Scream Factory and it's a good one. The audio and video transfers are both top notch and the film has never looked or sounded better in my experience. The extras are decent enough to keep one's interest throughout but one interview with John Carpenter makes me a bit sad because he sounds so tired of the filmmaking process and the politics that always seem to drag it down. The theatrical trailer is included and it practically gives away the entire movie so don't even bother with that until you've seen the film proper. There's also another cool little featurette that shows the film's various shooting locations as they stand today. The host of the piece is actually quite likable and I'd love to see more of these in other releases. You can also find other goodies like radio spots and promotional stills inside.John Carpenter's ""Prince of Darkness"" gets treated very well with this re-release on Blu-Ray. Fans will surely be pleased and newcomers would do well to pick this one up. Perfect late night fare that will surely give you the creeps.",N/A
427413,"After the notorious despot Vlad destroys her father along with the rest of the supreme council on their home planet Drakulon, Ella takes off across the stars to a small planet called Earth, where Vlad intends to enslave the inhabitants as a source of sustenance for his dark legions. With her powers amplified, Ella aims to put an end to Vlad before he can complete his sinister plan. Forrest J Ackerman's sexy heroine comes to life in the Roger Corman production of VAMPIRELLA, but a cheesy, low-budget one, at that. Years before the major studios were tossing millions of dollars at most comic book franchises, the independents managed to squeeze out a few schlocky entries of their own, including Full Moon's DOCTOR MORDRID (taken from a screen adaptation of the Doctor Strange comics), the shelved version of Corman's own FANTASTIC FOUR, and VAMPIRELLA. It is tough to say which is worse in this case, between the poorly choreographed action sequences, the ridiculous overacting, or the narrow-minded plot. If director Jim Wynorski's resume speaks towards anything, it is his tendency to gravitate towards cheap, hastily-made exploitation films, and this is certainly no exception. When she isn't speaking, fashion model Talisa Soto looks fine enough in costume, although the design is far less flattering than one might hope. A discussion into the differences between the comics and the film would be fruitless given the liberal use of the character, so suffice it to say that VAMPIRELLA is nothing more than B-movie fodder that can easily be avoided.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Vampirella VHS

1405057,"A simple and beautiful work of art, I felt as though this film lifted my heart right out of my body so that I could gently massage it with my uncontrollable tears.  How does Miguel (Christian Mercado), a man with all his Latino machismo, devotion to his pregnant wife Mariela (Tatiana Astengo), and a deep affinity for his humble fishing village with its centuries old traditions reconcile his love for another man, Santiago (Manolo Cardona)--- a known gay painter whom the entire village shuns?Miguel's denial is deep and strong and his guilt and shame are sometimes overbearing. When Santiago drowns in an undertow, he returns to Miguel as a ghost who cannot be seen or heard by anyone other than Miguel.  But Miguel is faced with a heart wrenching dilemma. Santiago will never be able to find peace in death unless his body is found and offered to the Lord with a traditional funeral service involving a public ceremony and burial at sea.  But this tiny Peruvian village with its fundamental Christian beliefs is an unlikely backdrop for any type of service honoring a deceased homosexual who was well known and considered a destructive force to everything the villagers stood for.In order to convince the people to honor his lover in death, Miguel will have to make public the relationship the two men shared. He will also have to convince Santiago's mother as well as the villagers and the local priest that this ""proper"" burial is not only what Santiago wanted but what is required for him to rest in peace. It will also mean that he will never see Santiago's ghost again or share any more time with the man he loved.Treat yourself to a viewing of this achingly beautiful masterpiece which showcases love, compassion, honor, dignity, and acceptance in their purest and sincerest form.",N/A

1588938,"I've been a fan of the Star Trek films and TV series for many years now. My favorite of the films remains Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home--but I've really enjoyed J.J. Abrams' take on the Trek universe. What I've loved most about this franchise overall, however, is not the sci-fi elements or the adventure or the special effects (which were amazing!), but the characters. The crew of the Enterprise is a wildly diverse group that has somehow produced just the right chemistry. They're not just a crew, they're a family. In the face of overwhelming danger, they come together in the way families do.I'm pretty sure this is no longer a secret, so no spoiler alert--in Star Trek: Into Darkness, Kirk and company have their first face-off with the notorious Khan, who appears on Earth with an offer to help a couple whose child is dying. He can save her, he promises. But his offer comes with a price...one that will lead to the deaths of many members of Starfleet, including Kirk's mentor, Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Kirk and the Enterprise crew set off in pursuit.The young Captain James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) is what anyone familiar with the character in his later years would expect: brash, stubborn, daring--but always with the best intentions. And with a middle name like Tiberius, one can assume he learned to fight at an early age. He is, as Admiral Pike puts it, Starfleet's ""only genius-level repeat offender.""Spock (Zachary Quinto), by contrast, is still trying to be all Vulcan, in spite of his half human side. Kirk brings out that human side, which frustrates Spock. Kirk has a nasty habit of giving a single-finger salute to logic. He might not break the rules, but he'll bend them beyond recognition, the way Uri Geller used to bend spoons.The negatives? I was disappointed that a pivotal scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was borrowed in this movie, reversed to have Kirk dying to save the Enterprise as Spock did in that film. If one is going to rewrite Trek history, don't include retread scenes! Also, I never bought into the relationship between Spock and Uhura--there was never anything in the original series to even hint at such a relationship, and it seemed to me it was contrived to give the character a stronger presence in the story. It wasn't necessary. Uhura is and always was a great character without the romance angle.All of the actors (Pine, Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Anton Yelchin are spot-on in their roles. (Okay, I do have one question: how is it that Scotty, in his later years, has so much more hair than young Scotty? He really is a miracle-worker--or those 23rd-century replicators are just that good!) Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan brings just the right degree of brilliance and menace to the role. I would have preferred he be a more complex villain, like Tom Hiddleston's Loki in Thor and The Avengers, but still I'm glad the character wasn't killed off--there's always the possibility he'll return in a future installment (and I do hope there will be future installments).",Star Trek Into Darkness

216552,"A curious blend of science fiction and Biblical sensibilities.  Earth is doomed, as it so often is in these types of films; people are hoping to escape the impending disaster in rockets that have yet to be designed or proven worthy of space travel.  However, desperation calls for instant solutions!  The hitch is that not everyone believes there is a problem heading straight for Earth.  Governments want to talk it over first.  Opposing scientists question the veracity of those who discovered the problem (a pesky star on collision course with Earth).  They don't believe the star will even come close.  It's left to a band of believers to come up with an answer.  They hit on the unoriginal idea of an ark.  As luck would have it, there just happens to be a planet orbiting the killer star and hopefully it might be habitable.  Regardless, with a pioneer spirit, they're heading for it!The problems with this film are minuscule.  There are a few loose plot threads, some questions in logic, and a truly abysmal matte painting at the end.  Other than that, the most intriguing aspect of this film has to do with the social implications, who decides the passenger list?  Why do animals/cargo rate higher than people do?  Why is everyone on board white?  Why only one child (they weigh less therefore more people could be saved)?  And why on earth are all the passengers dressed like monks!?",When Worlds Collide VHS

1661488,"A good documentary.Something wonderful ended on November 22nd 1963, not only Jack Kennedy's life, but our sweet optimism. My generation still has faded memories of that America, but we were so young that it seems to us now as a ghost-like dream, a mental daguerreotype. By the time we came of age a decade or so later, this place was damaged - cynical and jaded. Maybe one day the United States will recover from what happened on November 22nd 1963, but I suppose it won't be until the last survivor with a conscious memory of those four dark days passes from the scene.2013 has been a year filled with so many half-century milestones that it is difficult to keep track of them all. 1963 was indeed a year of historical landmarks - beautiful and not-so-beautiful. You know you're starting to get up there in years when you can clearly recall events from fifty years ago. I would only come to appreciate what a historical year 1963 was as I got older. From Civil Rights on earth, to the exploration of the heavens, President Kennedy's murder on the streets of Dallas, Texas fifty-years-ago today was merely the curtain closing on one of the most monumental years of the American Century. Wasn't that a time?He still matters fifty years later. Jack Kennedy refuses to go gently into that good night.Tom Degan",American Experience: JFK
1008452,"This is a sweet story of a friendship between two lonely people with a fifty year age span.  Mrs. Palfrey's first disappointment was the Claremont; it was a far cry from what was advertised in the brochure.  But, being the pleasant and stalwart individual that she is, she swallowed her disappointment and made the best of it.  The next disappointment was her grandson - a self-centered, immature lad who did not see beyond his own wants.  And then came the bright spot when she made the acquaintance of a young man  who is, in essence, what she wished for in her grandson.  We should all aspire to have the attitude of Mrs. Palfrey in our lives.

I swore I wouldn't see this dreck, but eventually caved just to see the train wreck Burton made ... only to NOT hate it as much as I thought, but also (thankfully) to find out that the film is NOT a comedy (and should not have been marketed as such by the studio). There are comedic touches and a black comedy overtone to the film, at times, to be sure - but in general, the story of a centuries-old vampire named Barnabas Collins (Depp), who is released from his coffin prison to walk among the living (and his ancestral home) again, is a tongue-in-cheek drama that is generally just not a good film ... but also not the piece of crap I thought it to be.

1533498,"MOONRISE KINGDOM is the latest, quirky movie by Wes Anderson.  Fans will love the story of childhood love set on a New England island called New Penzance in 1965. Sam and Suzy are 12-year olds who meet one summer. They write throughout the year and make a pact to sneak off together the next summer. Sam abandons his scout troop, and Suzy leaves her parents. The two kids meet up and share an innocent love while the entire island is looking for them.I've enjoyed all the Wes Anderson movies I've watched (only missed one), but I'm not an ardent fan or defender. His casts are always top notch, and this film includes Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, and Edward Norton. Fans of Anderson will find plenty to like in this quirky coming of age story.Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman steal the show as Sam and Suzy, two young kids who are in love. They share adventure, and a first kiss on a beach they call Moonrise Kingdom. I however, wanted to point out that I believe there is a little too much sexuality in the film concerning a 12 year old girl. I don't deny that it is realistic, or that it works in the movie. While on the beach, the two kids go swimming, stripping down to underwear. Suzy's bra shows tons of cleavage, and one shot basically shoots straight down her bra. Also, she asks the little boy to put his hand on her chest. I felt uncomfortable watching scenes on film that are usually depicted by actors at least 18 years of age.I went on Amazon affiliated IMDB to see other viewer's thoughts on this, and anyone who was critical of the sexuality in this movie was called every name in the book. I've never seen so much hate in my life. Fans of Anderson have every right to defend this movie. But as someone who considered watching this movie with my 11 and 9 year old kids, I'm sure glad I didn't. I'm writing this review to give a heads up to parents who may feel the same way I do. People may bash this review too, or think I'm a prude or out of touch. Trust me, I'm not. I enjoy sex and romance in a movie just as much as the next guy, I just don't want to see 12 year olds doing it.",N/A

1216419,There are 12 episodes in this series. At least seven of them are filled with either Kuu's whining self-pity or Kyoshiro's pompous teenage angst. The story only really gets going when Kyoshiro's long lost brother turns up and turns out to be a complete monster. The last third of the series moves along well enough and the ending could be a tear jerker if you cared about the main characters at all at that point.

What I dislike a lot of times when it comes to animating features like this one is that the writers have to &#34;downsize&#34; the story because of the adult contents which a lot of kids would find confusing or not understand unless they read the actual comic book which a lot of kids cannot.  Otherwise, my love of these animated features is what I look forward to when I go to Amazon.com and look up certain animated features that I hear about finally coming out on DVD.  Another reason, of course, is because of my love of Saturday morning cartoons when they were great. (this would be back in the mid-60s).  I have always had a love of Saturday Morning Cartoons and animated features ever since I watched my first animated TV show when I was a little kid.  Nowadays, I look forward to any animated superhero feature, depending on whether or not I remember the character from the &#34;old days&#34;.

1320382,"This budget-priced Looney Tunes Super Stars line had two sure-fire hits with their first go-round. One was a Bugs Bunny themed set called ""Hare Extraordinaire"" while the other had Daffy Duck cartoons in the name of ""Frustrated Fowl"". This review is for the aptly-named Daffy release.The first six cartoons, produced before the year 1953, are fantastic. They're all nicely restored prints shown in their full frame format.That's the way it should be. Too bad that makes up about 37 minutes of a nearly two hour disc.The other nine cartoons, produced after 1953, are mostly decent cartoons in their own right, but are cropped to fill widescreen formats. Some of these crops are jarring, like ""Design for Leaving"" has parts of gags missing! These crops are not the intents of any the artists who worked hard to make these shorts.While Warner Bros. would eventually return to making all cartoons full frame for future compilations, the damage to this product line has been done. I rate it 2 stars because majority of the product has been fooled around with.Now that being said, I do need to draw attention to one cartoon in particular. ""Wise Quackers"" (full frame) from 1949 is easily the most controversial cartoon on this disc, with MANY gags cut out on television showings in the past. That alone might be worth the price of admission to collectors. Otherwise, this collection can sadly be skipped.",Looney Tunes Super Stars: Daffy Duck Frustrated Fowl

Need, need is what drives the characters of this story - the needs of Jake, in particular, whom is the catalyst which leads the train to its shocking end. Jake's need for a mother, his friendship with Aaren and the love he feels for Ethan but is ashamed to admit. These people are not depraved, that would suggest they were somehow WRONG or crazy. That is not the case. These are normal people driven by compulsions into insane conditions and for Jake, those compulsions lead him to commit some of the most heinous acts out of revenge and self-loathing.I also noticed in the credits that the Ethan character is the same guy who wrote, produced, edited and directed this masterpiece. My hats off to him. He did an amazing job for someone wearing so many hats and with the budget he had. Sure there were some places the writing could have used some brushing up, such as the ending. I wasn't crazy about the way Ethan apparently just walked away in the end and goes back to Kyle's place. What about Hannah? Why not call the police or something? Aside from that, good job.

1417837,"I want to start this review by acknowleging the fact that I did enjoy Sam Raimi's take on Spider-Man. I, like many was one of the fellow fans that expected a Spider Man 4 as a continiuation to the series. I like many was caught completely off guard when the announcement was made that the sereies was going to be rebooted; as a matter of fact, I was angry. I decided that nonetheless, I was going to see if Sony could make a better Spider-Man. I said, ""this is a movie I am either going to like or completely hate."" And after multiple viewings, plus a blu-ray purchase later, the consensus is: I hate that I like this movie so much.Starring Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider- Man, The amazing Spider-Man tells the origin story of how Peter Parker came to become the famed web-slinger. While this movie does NOT (spoiler) include Uncle Ben's infamous advice he gives to Peter about responsibility, the story (unlike Sam Raimi's films) revolves primarily around Peter's parents, specifically his father. Actually, the film starts out when Peter is still quite young. The story is not quite suspensful or thrilling, but it has a balanced even tone of humor; more notably the humorous side of Spider-Man is present in the movie.Another likable aspect in the movie is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) in the movie. Peter is as we all know the guy that is easily bullied and unpopular, but has a particularly brilliant thinking mind when it comes to science, Gwen is easy on the eyes and the girl every guy admires and dreams about, and in The Amazing Spider Man its Peter's smarts (and his courage early on) that sets him apart from the rest. The chemistry between these two helps the movie in more ways than none.This movie is not without its cons, many of which I was able to overlook and forget about, but a few worth mentioning. Rhys Ifans stars as Dr. Connors. And for you familar Spider-Man fans, we all know what character Dr. Connors transforms into. Unfortunately his take on the villain he portrays is not as menacing or memorable as it should be and the CGI is well.....eh but oh well. Now as my headline said this Spider Man movie feels a lot darker compared to the prievious Spider Man movies. Among the common complaints from a few of my fellow colleagues that watched this movie, the most common one was that this movie copied the original Spider Man movie or that it felt too modernized. I do feel that some things were borrowed from the orginal, but I do not feel it is a big enough probblem to be worrried about. Flaws in The Amazing Spider-Man? Sure. Is it still a good movie? Yes it is.All that aside, The Amazing Spider-Man is creative; be it that it is also really exceptional (and I mean unconventionally Exceptional). It has its faults, but overall it holds its ground well as a start for the new series.3.5 starsSupporting Cast: Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Dennis Leary, Irrfan Khan",The Amazing Spider-Man

701537,"Dirt Boy was a mix bag of odd parameters infused into the story aimed at adding mystery, believability and to enhance the causation of the chain of events that led to the murders. DB is NOT a horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller that revolves around an ex-junky a one hit wonder author and the odd little town the author lives. The town and its residents are beholden to the author for the astronomical amount of money (this makes no sense) his books revenues brings to them. Mr. Matthews is a lost soul looking for understanding and forgiveness in regards to the loss of his mother in a car accident. He visits Atwater Commons to attend a two week seminar on understanding serial killers and their apprehension which is odd to say the least since his mom died in a car accident. I am not sure why this would help him heal from his loss or maybe it is some weird way for him to help understand death and its effects on people? I just don't see the link to serial killer seminar except for the book DB that he doesn't know about until he arrives in the town? Matthews character gets caught up in the Dirt Boy book and starts to investigate the books murders (I guess he was driven from the seminar) and guess what he finds ??? The story keeps getting more bizarre with his discovery from the reactions of the locals as well as the lack of a visible law enforcement presence and their actions. I was going to give some detailed info on all the bizarre quirks in this story, but that would reveal to much so I won't. This story loosely reminds me of a Stephen King story only a lot more disjointed and lacking a much needed polishing job for clarification and cohesion. I say that becauce of the small New England town feel, his older car (not a classic) and the strange story. So I've listed a few of the oddities that present themselves in this story to give you an idea of what you are up against as a guide to the bizarre nature of this story. The acting and direction are good, but as described before the story needs work and in the hands of a good writer I think that this would make for a great movie. I must say that even with all the quirks in the writing I still enjoyed this movie and its odd ball characters and its little town full of mysterious residents. I seldom will enjoy a movie that has so many quirks in the writing or a combination of issues that include acting, direction, editing and so on. I hope if you give this movie a try that you can overlook its flaws and still be able to enjoy the story as is unfolds to its conclusion. 3 starsRating 0 to 5Story = 3 The hard way.Acting = 3.5Direction = 3Fear Factor = 1Gore = .5Sex/Nudity = NO and NoFoul Language = Not muchEntertainment Value = 3",N/A

1541545,"Several months ago I shelled out $5 or so for this movie which was on Blu ray.  I didn't know anything about it other than its cast consists of 3 of the best actresses of their generation.  As it turns out the film was a bomb at the box office and with the critics.  On a boring afternoon, I was looking for something that I didn't have to think about too much and certainly didn't feel like reading subtitles, so I pulled out this film from the summer of 2012.Directed by Oscar nominee Bruce Beresford (""Tender Mercies""), the film is a by-the-numbers family drama, complete with generational conflict, romance, break-ups, and reconciliation.  Catherine Keener plays Diane, a successful, but uptight, New York attorney whose fed up husband (Kyle MacLachlan) walks out on her.  Neither is upset about it as they stopped loving each other long ago.  Diane decides to go visit her hippy mother, Grace (Jane Fonda) who still resides in Woodstock, N. Y. never having left after the first historic musical event in 1969.  And by the looks of the town, all the residents remain 60 something hippies protesting the war, any war, still dressed in psychedelic clothing.Diane brings her 2 kids with her.  Jake (Nat Wolff) is a mid-teen obsessed with a video camera.  Zoe (Elizabeth Olsen) is a college student who has degree of arrogance about her that almost matches Diane's.  Diane hadn't seen her mother for 20 years due to a falling out years earlier.  Grace is a free spirit, then and now.  She smokes weed, does the organic thing, allows chickens in her house, and sleeps around.  It's what drove Diane away and things haven't change.Eventually everyone loosens up, gets paired up, breaks up and gets back together.  Sound familiar?  Sure.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Marissa O'Donnell and Chace Crawford play the local love interests and yes they all look cute together.  That's exactly what this movie is, cute.  Nothing more, nothing less.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  It is perfectly fine.  There are no distracting issues in the digitally shot movie.  The audio, likewise, is excellent.  Complete with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, the sounds are where they should be.  The dialog is clear, centered and easily understood.  The extras are minimal.  You get the usual number of trailers about movies you don't care about and a short featurette.",N/A

1047734,"This a movie of a man obsessed with scent. He loves them all and makes no distinctions between bad and good scents.I am someone who adores perfumes and have quite a collection so the beginning of the movie really touched a chord with me about how he soaks in all the scents almost as though they were tangible objects. The movie does a good job of showing the smells as tangible objects, too.I found the move to be wonderfully haunting, beautiful cinematography and when the search for the ultimate scent leads to him murdering women (although why he couldn't have explained what he wanted to do beforehand, then got a woman who was willing) it felt like a child who wonders why he gets hit by a truck when he runs out on the road.All he wanted was the scent, this kind of magical, awesome scent that would change the world, and because he murders to do it, the movie is deeply dark and haunting.I have never seen a film quite like it, and I have never read the book though I tried but all the descriptions slowed the pace too much for me.The ending was a bit farfetched as if one drop couild transform a crowd of people, so I felt this was overdone, but the main character does a good job of being this darkly strange man who has trouble escaping his obsession, until he just gives into it and searches and searches for the scent he knows he can create.This did not feel like a horror film to me. No mistake, I was disgusted with his methods with the women, but this was no gory, slash and burn kind of film.",N/A

I believe many of the episodes are based in part on the stories that were written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, only they've been updated to reflect the current day.Although I might've read only one or two of the original &#34;Holmes&#34; stories, so I'm not an expert by any means, I'm a big fan of the old black and white movies that starred Basil Rathbone (Sherlock) and Nigel Bruce (Dr. Watson). This new SHERLOCK series is just as good and its stars, Benedict Cumberbatch as &#34;Sherlock&#34; and Martin Freeman &#34;Watson,&#34; make a great pair.There's only three episodes but they run about 90-minutes each and are absolutely fantastic! I like how they have graphic embellishments throughout, like when someone on screen receives a text on their phone the text will overlay on your TV screen so you can see what the text says or when Sherlock starts zeroing in on clues the camera will focus and highlight each, so you get his perspective, and these really help punctuate the story.The picture on the Blu-Ray is gorgeous but it should be considering that this is a new production. About the only complaint I have is that you can't bookmark an episode and resume play doesn't work, so if you're in the middle of the show and stop, you'll have to restart from the beginning and then pick scene selection.

X-men 3: The Last Stand is certainly the weakest of the 3, but it has some great action set pieces and some pretty shocking twists. Finally, the Fantastic Four films.

(Sure *looked* like Princeton...why no scene at the Princeton Record Exchange? no plug).I don't want to give away the plot...though the director seems to have THROWN IT AWAY at about midpoint, I say redundantly. But talk about taking a really interesting, relatable idea and making it as complicated as possible! As complicated as the characters are: Lily Tomlin plays Tina's Mother..still the hippie...but completely without the love and the peace. She tells Tina that she is child of lust...then jumps into the sack on her first half-date with a longtime, secret admirer (she was an activist in the '70s and he was a hippie sympathizer/male feminist - who happens to be involved in the admissions process of a gifted guy who lacks the creds but has made it on a ridiculously high IQ. And who too just might be the fruit of some labor of lust?).While Tina is trying to sort all of that out....she reluctantly restarts a relationship with a guy from the past - who is the self-appointed mentor/promoter of the afore-mentioned child-genius.How did this woman ever get hired at Princeton, 16 years before? Maybe then she had some respect for the institution and its' recruitment process?Enough! Go see it please for Tina and Lily and guess who?

Not crazy about the actual title of the series itself.If you have seen many previous Kennedy docs then this might be a disappointment. If you have little knowledge of the Kennedy administration then it is informative. If you are going to have only one or very few Kennedy docs in your possession, there are better ones out there to pick from.*The bonus disc is worth the price of purchase: it contains:- a vintage B&W; Secret Service sponsered newsreel about the ""facts"" of the assassination with amazing footage of Dealy Plaza and the school book depository shortly after the events.- B&W; Nixon/Kennedy debate- a (30 min approx) colour coverage of the entire funeral event in Washington.- lastly there is a John Ford 1971 ""Produced"" doc on Vietnam which is a very bias pro-intervention view of the events  with Chuck Heston narrating, but still is an interesting time capsule of the time period and the struggle to make sense of a sense-less conflict which at that point was still raging.Overall :  6 out of  10",N/A

From tag matches to the gimmick matches there was something for everyone here. Of course the match I was looking forward to the most was The Shield finally mixing it up in there. Also I knew the main event would be great because Ziggler was in there and Cena always delivers when he is in there with someone like Ziggler.1.[TABLES MATCH]REY MYSTERIO & SIN CARA VS RHODES SCHOLARS-great opening match right here as two good tag teams go at it for a shot at the tag titles. Scholars remind me of old school classic heel teams and Rey & Cara are just excellent. This was a fun match with Rey and Cara starting strong using the table as a weapon. But the Scholars would fight back taking control working over Cara most of the time. The high flyers would try to come back from that but it would be that style of offense that would cost them. Sin Cara would attempt a springboard only to be shoved in the air out onto a table thus giving Rhodes Scholars the win. Also I love that the crowd was chanting ""Cody's mustache"".2.[US TITLE]ANTONIO CESARO VS R TRUTH-this was a good match but in my opinion it was too short. This felt like a match we could have got on Smackdown or something. Still it was a competitive match with back and forth action. Truth of course was the quicker of the two delivering his signature moves but Cesaro still comes out on top with a more grounded attack.3.[I-C TITLE]KOFI KINGSTON VS WADE BARRETT-next up is the I-C title match and both guys deliver here. Once again it is a bit shorter than I thought it should have been but it was good. This was a great back and forth affair with Kofi hitting all the high spots and Wade using his power to his advantage. These two work really well together and gave us a great match with Kofi winning the title.Right here we get CM Punk and Paul Heyman up in their box cutting a great promo on the New York crowd and Ryback.4.[TLC MATCH]THE SHEILD VS TEAM HELL NO & RYBACK-talk about a war and you will be talking about this match. This was an extremely entertaining and dramatic match. This was the match I was most looking forward to and  I was right as this was an excellent match. I was surprised that this match was this soon into the event but still it was a great match. The Shield looked amazing in their first match sticking to the plan of many against one as they would isolate one opponent at a time. Ryback of course looked strong during his offensive moments as did Kane and Bryan was a ""pitbull"" as they called him. There were many high spots and crazy moments throughout the match. The double superplex off of the table, power bomb on the announcers table and Kane getting speared through the barricade and then getting buried never to be seen again. Of course Rollins took a huge fall that took him out of the match only for his teammates to get the win for the team moments later. I was happy that The Shield got the win here in what could easily be the best match f the night.5.[DIVAS TITLE]EVE TORRES VS NAOMI-Naomi won the preshow Divas battle Royal to get the title shot here and like many other Divas matches it was short and nothing to special. Eve keeps the belt in a quick bonus match.6.[WORLD TITLE CHAIR MATCH]BIG SHOW VS SHEAMUS-we get another good match up next which was the World title match in which chairs were legal. Sheamus looked good early on trying to take Show's legs out. Show would fight back and use his size advantage to overpower Sheamus at times. This was a high impact match that would see some good spots. I loved the KO shot Show landed and that huge chair was great. Show keeps the belt in another good match.7.THE MIZ, ALBERTO DEL RIO, & BROOKLYN BRAWLER VS 3MB-this match happened as a bonus because of a 3MB guest appearance Miz TV segment earlier in the night. This was  a good little match that didn't take much time. It was cool to see the Brooklyn Brawler back in action although a little slower. The action was good and Brawler was able to get the win with a Boston Crab.8.[MITB LADDER MATCH]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS JOHN CENA-Ziggler's Money in the Bank contract was on the line here against Cena. I remember wanting Ziggler to win so bad even though I like Cena. Anyway this was a really good match and actually one of the best of the night. Cena always seems do bring his ""A"" game when he is in there with someone like Ziggler. This was a very physical affair as this ladder match was basically a TLC match with all kinds of weapons being used. Ziggler of course was excellent as always but even Cena surprised everyone hitting things like a Frankensteiner. This back and forth contest was great but it was the ending that everyone will most likely remember. AJ comes out to stop Vickie from getting involved in the match only to turn on Cena as he is going up the ladder by pushing it over. This allows Ziggler to climb to the top and win. Great ending.This was a fun event that had a few great matches in it and good ones throughout the rest. In all honesty this is one of my favorites of 2012. The Shield match is one of the most fun matches I have ever watched with everyone. Then of course the drama and ending of the main event was excellent. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone, also we get an interview with Dolph as a special feature. I still don't get why the pre show Divas battle Royal was not added as a special feature.","WWE: TLC - Tables, Ladders & Chairs 2012"

1610741,"This is the long-awaited set of two-reel comedies starring Charley Chase, probably the most underrated funnyman of the 1920s and 1930s. Chase specialized in the comedy of embarrassment; his screen character would become embroiled in a misunderstanding, and spend the rest of the film innocently but amusingly proceeding on the wrong assumption. This formula had served him well since the silent-movie days, and by 1938 -- when this set begins -- he adapted it to the faster-paced, slapstick-oriented comedy unit at Columbia Pictures. He starred in 20 comedy shorts for Columbia; this collection includes eight, plus one that he directed.The director of most of these shorts is Mack Sennett/Three Stooges veteran Del Lord. Chase contributed some of the gags and even entire screenplays to the series, and both Lord and Chase reached back to their silent-era shorts for surefire comedy ideas. Through most of this set Charley is a victim of circumstance. His ""reconditioned"" car falls apart on him in RATTLING ROMEO; he doesn't recognize his wife when she goes blonde in THE CHUMP TAKES A BUMP; he hosts a disastrous dinner party in SOUTH OF THE BOUDOIR; he's an expert on marital problems who has troubles himself in MAN BITES LOVEBUG. In the one radical departure from his usual pleasant persona, he's an obnoxious sports fan who makes life miserable for players and spectators alike in THE HECKLER. Most of these funny situations were strong enough that Columbia could refilm them years later with other stars, but not with the signature Chase charm.You'll notice that by 1938 Chase was a little too old to play the boy next door opposite college-aged starlets, but he projects the same young-man-about-town personality. Chase's vis-a-vis here is usually Ann Doran, whose plain-Jane looks and demeanor (and enthusiastic performances) are a welcome change from the uninspired glamour girls drafted from the studio's stock company. The supporting casts are filled with familiar faces from the Three Stooges comedies: Vernon Dent, Bud Jamison, John Tyrrell, Richard Fiske, Bess Flowers, etc. Stooge director Jules White had no hand in these eight Chase shorts, so there is much less of the standard slapping-around, pants-on-fire, knocked-out-cuckoo slapstick typical of White's Columbia shorts.If there's one problem with these engaging shorts, it's that they sometimes end before we want them to. Director Lord sets up a comic situation, builds up the complications, and often just calls things to a halt when the two reels are up. Sometimes the films end on a cute note: RATTLING ROMEO concludes with a marriage proposal. Other films screech to a stop with no real payoff (THE HECKLER has Charley held at gunpoint, and suddenly the screen goes dark!).Charley Chase was himself a talented director, and this set includes as a bonus the 1938 Columbia short A NAG IN THE BAG, starring vaudeville's Joe Smith and Charlie Dale, and directed by Chase. This one has lots of laughs, as drive-in restaurant owners Joe and Charlie get gambling fever and try to win big at the race track. Director Chase balances their strength as dialect comedians with Columbia's broad visual gags, so the comedy is physical but not violent (Joe and Charlie tangled in a phone booth with burly Bud Jamison, for example). Listen for a cameo by Mr. Chase: his voice is heard on the telephone, on a car radio, and as the racetrack announcer!Print quality throughout is superior, restored by Sony's Grover Crisp from glowing 35mm materials. UPDATE: You'll find the other 12 Chase comedies in Volume Two, also sold by Amazon.Charley Chase and the Columbia shorts have quite a large following among vintage-comedy fans, and these comedies are great fun to watch. Highly recommended.",Charley Chase Shorts - Vol 01

This is a good documentary explaining how too easy credit to buy stocks (you could buy stocks in those days with only 10% down), market manipulations and way too much speculation, despite a faltering economy in 1929, led to the crash.

It picks up exactly where the 1st film left off and it does for the most part follow the manga almost 100% A few things were left out, like the gambling lessons and how to play the games, but to me that was a good thing. I found that to be very dull in the manga and also they added nudity in this anime as well, as they did in the First Combustion. The manga has no nudity at all, and Balot looks a little different but anyways, back to this work. The story seems to run rather short and kinda ends abruptly, like the first film.I know this series has maybe 1 maybe 2 more films to finish the story and I wish they wouldn't take so damn long to make it but I did think that both films are good, so its worth the wait. I'm just not very patient so I would like to see the next film soon and also wish the next volume of the manga would drop already. It is odd that they mention a lot of egg jokes in this series. (Dr. Easter, Boiled, Shell...etc.) I guess its an inside joke somewhere but i don't  understand it. Overall, if you enjoy the manga i recommend you watch this, and if you enjoy this anime, watch the First Compression if you haven't and I highly recommend the manga to you as well..

1538896,"This is a film that dwells in the real street level of people barely holding on. Never blaming or criticizing, it holds its' characters accountable for their own actions, even by the supporting cast of characters within the film. Within the film we see the bottom of human depths and dependancy and the frail social, public and governmental resources available to allay and defray those depths of suffering. And in almost every case they fail. What the fervent, religious and grotesquely optimistic can never fathom is the loss of all hope. The absolute and irreversible knowledge that we have done all that we can, and that even more poignant, we know it is not enough. Nick Flynn&#8217;s mother falls into this category. His father falls into the category of a force of nature that while irresistible is still horribly broken and unforgiving. And yet he is the one who survives and as the last scene of the film provides has made some small acquiescence to, maybe not the nature of his own flesh and blood, but to the very nature of humanity to expound, nurture and forgive. And finally to the mercurial Olivia Thirlby, who has once again put herself into another beautiful film of somewhat flawed but hopeful and redemptive human decency.",Being Flynn

37960,"I love the franchise but I have to vote this as the worst Nightmare on Elm Street film by far. Even the reboot was better. Freddy's Dead looked silly on release and it hasn't aged well at all. New Line had way too much fun with this one because it's not scary, well-acted, or funny and the special effects are atrocious (including the pointless 3D at the end). It brings a lame-brained plot twist of Freddy having a (previously unmentioned) daughter to carry on his legacy. The casting is the worst of the series and there are no romantic angles to engage viewers dramatically. The kids are very annoying (except Breckin Meyer) and they don't die. Lisa Zane almost saves it but there are way too many problems with makeup, special effects, editing and delivery. I like Yaphet Kotto but didn't appreciate him hitting Freddy with a baseball bat when he isn't the guy to play the ""Final Girl"" (WTF was he doing?). Adults don't normally fight Freddy aside from his getting burned in his own boiler. All the ideas in this film were quickly tossed in ANOES 7: New Nightmare and never returned. Parts 1-5 had a lot of continuity but this one asks the viewer for too much while delivering too little. It almost feels like it was made by a different studio because it's so strangely cobbled together. Admittedly, audience preferences were shifting but this entry was completely off the mark for what came before. Freddy's Dead introduced the ridiculous plot device of Freddy speaking straight into the camera (""It's travelling time!"") that was continued in Freddy vs. Jason (""No one is afraid of me anymore.). Since when do scary villains serve as the narrator? Freddy's makeup is ridiculous because you can see Englund is wearing a mask especially with the skin around his eyes poking out. Even great cameos from Johnny Depp, Alice Cooper, Roseanne, and Tom Arnold can't save it. The ending feels like a friendly reunion that lacks punch and almost destroyed the franchise completely. The ending of Part 3: Dream Warriors was much more fitting for a conclusion to the series. Amazon reviewers give this a lowly 3 star rating.ANOES fans should check out the much better films included in theA Nightmare on Elm Street Collection (All 7 Original Nightmare Films + Bonus Disc) [Blu-ray].",N/A

229174,"Way of the Dragon(1972) was the only film starring and directed by Bruce Lee. Lee played Tong Long, a Chinese guy who travels to Italy to help relatives who run a Chinese restaurant. The US English dub deleted scenes such as a nude scene with Italian starlet Malisa Longo or Tong Long trying to use a toilet! Some prints of the movie are called ""Return of the Dragon"". The film mixes kung fu with slapstick humor. In one scene, a bad guy hits himself with nunchakus! Nora Miao is quite lovely as a Chinese woman living in Italy. Chuck Norris played a martial artist who is hired to challenge Tong Long. The non-Chinese in the film are portrayed as stereotypes and there's some homophobic humor aimed at one of the bad guys! The music score is quite good. It mixes smooth jazz with bombastic Chinese music! The cinematography is really good. You can clearly see Tong Long fight the bad guys. There are many kung fu films that suffer from bad camera work. Way of the Dragon also looks and feels like 1972. Way of the Dragon is a classic left behind by the late Bruce Lee.",Return of the Dragon VHS
1592067,"KILLING THEM SOFTLY, the riveting crime drama from writer/director Andrew Dominik, evokes memories of Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS, in that it spends a lot of time, particularly before anything significant happens, exploring the personalities of pair of secondary characters; not-too-bright amateur criminals who are about to enter the ""big time"" with disastrous results.These two schmucks (Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn), with the plan of fellow ex-con Vincent Curatola, make the mistake of holding up a Mob card game, run by Ray Liotta.  Curatola figures that, since Liotta had engineered a heist of his game once before, he will be blamed for this robbery also.Mendelsohn, however,  is not only a drug addict, but he also has a big mouth, and it not long before the Mob (represented by Richard Jenkins) knows the identities of the guys who pulled off the job.  Enforcer Brad Pitt is called in to take care of the three culprits, as well as Liotta, whose ""hit"" is necessary in the interest of ""public relations"".What makes KILLING THEM SOFTLY a unique crime drama, as well as a dark comedy, is that the action is played against the 2008 financial meltdown and Presidential campaign.  Like with the national meltdown, the robbing of the Mob card game has hurt the local crime economy.  For example, when Pitt tells Jenkins that he needs to bring in another hit man (James Gandolfini) to help him with pull off the 3-4 contact killings, the Mob boss' agrees to the price, but then insists, ""Have him fly coach"".Gritty dialogue, multi-dimensional characters, and fine performances all around results in this release from Anchor Bay Entertainment being one of the finest, and most realistic crime dramas of the past decade.A word of caution: The scenes of violence are extremely violent; not for the squeamish.DVD extras include a ""Making of"" featurette and four deleted scenes.

1127260,"To reiterate, the verbal part of the soundtrack contains no subtitles and is difficult to manage for the hearing impaired.  One hears enough to enjoy it  but not enough to follow many parts in detail.One need fear little or no interference with gratification from the potential memory clash with the classic musical based on the same original. There is no singing to Arlen and Harburg tunes, and no attempt to duplicate the unique qualities of Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger and Jack Haley, much less, Margaret Hamilton (the wicked witch) or Billie Burke (The Good Witch).Standing on its own, this is an entertaining version of the Frank Baum original, with a less distinguished cast than assayed the parts in the late thirties, but with a different set of expectations (straight acting) than pertained in the earlier work. The cast does a good job in a situation where overacting is invited by the situations played. No doubt to subdue the almost inevitable (with the older audience) temptation to recall the earlier musical score, this one has a strong musical background, often emphasized in scenes.Unless divided into its component three parts by the listener, there is a tendency toward tedium. More than 90 minutes at a time is a bit overlong. Stick to the episode lengths and I think you will find it more enjoyable.There is an adequate display of  visual phenomena but not up to the level, BIG pictures today accomplish with the computer based imagery.

I cannot put into words exactly what makes this such a great film, other than to say that the cinematography and sets are excellent.  &#34;Quintet&#34; is one of those films where understanding comes from emotion, which is all the more important here because many of the characters, Newman's central character included, are emotionally deficient. Again, some have seized upon this as an indicator of the film's inferior quality. Like the men and women in the space station in &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey,&#34; who were more robotic than human, these characters' lack of emotional reaction to events we cringe at is purposeful, and gives us a window into their lives. These are hardened, tragic figures.

618884,"A V-E-R-Y interesting take on the story nobody really knows. Never have I expected less of a movie and gotten more than with this version. This Helen is, in her own pre-Cyclopean-age way, more engaging than all others. This Helen is provocative and devious - and a problem child. The face that launched those ships is brooding and darkly smug. Do not forget she and Menelaus lived happily ever after. The dynamics of what could bring so much distress are intriguing and, up to a point, even logical. Menelaus is played by a younger James Callis (yes, THAT one) probably months before he took on the Baltar role. Oddly, there are moments, too, where the music sounds (prophetically, I mused) like that composed for Galactica.The slaughter of Iphigenia (a likely occurence for those times) concludes part 1 and is the benchmark by which those men who destroyed Troy must be judged not as great warriors but mere butchers. History somewhat supports the fact that some Achaeans (yet to be called Greeks) united to steal and plunder their way through the Eastern Mediterranean around 1250 BC - only to be swept away themselves within a generation, probably by the same violence they incited; the presumed decade-long assault on Troy was a sustained military campaign on small coastal cities and it occupied several generations of warriors (the Trojans were neither Greek, nor Hittite, but likely related to the proto-Latin Thracians, of whom a nation survives North of the Danube today; myth says Aeneas escaped the sack of Troy to go West and establish a Latin, but not Italian, Rome). The characters are almost inverted to our perception of them so far: Agamemnon the determined killer; Paris is the ultimate outsider; Helen the ultimate trophy wife (with an eerie reminder, whilst dressed with head jewels, of Schliemann's own mail-order bride similarly decorated with treasures found at Troy in 1873, ostensibly Helen's own). And we finally get more than a name from Cassandra and visual proof that bringing the Greek Horse inside the walls was a messy procedure.There are a few outstanding lines in an otherwise lame script (""You're a smudge on history's ledger, but you're my brother""), equally balanced by audaciously idiotic references to Byzantium or monkeys in Thrace - geographic tips for the low-information viewer, I suppose. And when was the last time you've seen a real garden in a ""Greek-themed"" movie? British accents are there, Achilles and Hector barely, CGI ships sail too tightly, the walls and towers of Troy are accurately crenelated but the landscape perhaps too steep and the history (or myth) gets seriously off-track in the second half. The rape scene at the end is disturbing. Movie is rated for originality.Michael Wood's In Search of the Trojan War, both book and TV series, is an impressive excursion through the reality of the Iliad, for those so inclined (but Michael, there were no Hungarian celts in 1250 BC). Two scenes in the movie accurately depict javelins as a personal combat weapon and Aechean (bronze) swords breaking at the hilt - bronze was later replaced by quality steel forged by (and purchased from) Thracians living as far as modern Transylvania.",Helen of Troy

501656,"WARNING: This is not your traditional horror film as it's classified a ""horror-thriller"" that seems like a twisted psychological drama mixed with the supernatural. Those looking for splatter, slasher, or linear horror elements should look elsewhere. 1973's Don't Look Now stars Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie who are in Venice while they grieve the loss of their daughter. It seems simple enough but the very idea of losing your children is possibly the most horrifying event a person could experience. Don't Look Now plays that up as Sutherland and Christie are essentially walking into a trap. That's probably what bothers most of the audience about the film and that's all you need to know plot-wise as the couple seeks answers. The ambiance behind the movie suggests there is some ominous evil behind it all and the more curious we get we learn that we all have a price to pay. This flick isn't mentioned much in mainstream horror rankings but is climbing in hardcore horror fans Top 100 rankings because of how unusual it is. If you are comfortable watching 70s atmospheric and tension building films then this could be right up your alley. This 1973 release actually has good acting and production values. It has aged well when compared to its peers like Black Christmas. The film knows what it wants to do to you. It was released near the same time as films like Wicker Man, Black Christmas and Carrie. So if the pacing, music or makeup of those films bothers you then you may want to give this a pass. There is a generation gap over the issue of pacing as the wonderful lack of a formula in the 1970s is in full swing here. Anything goes so you can either move with it or turn to Saw for harder horror.This is admittedly lighter horror similar to its peers The Haunting or The Changeling. The slasher or zombie movie wasn't really yet in full force just yet in 1973 so many odd tricks are seemingly played on the viewer. One does not know what to make of this film. If it is a thriller as billed then it could be the Best Thriller since Freaks (without the shock value). The value of this film lies in its ability to build suspense and create tension. The plot doesn't matter much as little is really explained to you. We follow Sutherland around trying to make sense of it all. Bizarre things happen with no reason at all. It's perfect for its era. It reminds me of The Deer Hunter in some odd way (remember the wedding scene?). If you liked Sutherland in Invasion of the Body Snatchers he does a remarkable job here as well.What the Film is Really About: The director wants you to feel like you are there and not watching a movie. Sometimes we don't hear things very clearly and struggle to make sense of it all. Some see that as lazy directing when it works as sheer genius. We identify with the likeable Sutherland. We experience what he does, see what he does and feel how he does (more frustrated, confused, angry and seeking answers). Sutherland running around the Venice canals at night are amongst the most striking, intense and claustrophobic of early 70s horror as we are rushed towards a thrilling climax. While it moves slow early on just enough happens to keep our interest. If you manage to make it to the end of the movie in this ""Solaris of Horror"" and are enjoying it all there is a good payoff. I have seen the film only 3 times where I have managed to completely forget it, stumble upon it and was genuinely not expecting the ending. I'm not sure how anyone could expect it without knowing it in advance. There is absolutely no warning and it's delightful. The ending does leave many questions unanswered. Perhaps that's what makes it great. Not to tip off any plot spoilers but perhaps the film's message is curiosity may be dangerous. It seems more like a Mystery than a Thriller to me. Perhaps that reclassification would boost its small but growing fanbase.Sex Scene: Some of those who get the movie understand the psychology of the action between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. The director deliberately stops the sex early between them by switching to a boring post-coital chitchat before thrusting back into the sex harder than before. Many people believe they really had sex to film the scene. The result is a psychological jarring of your mental state. You were expecting one thing to happen but it didn't (good old-fashioned filmmaking). These kind of bait-and-switch moves are used frequently. It's unsettling in a subtle, edgy and raw way you don't see much anymore. Kudos to the filmmakers for having the stones to create a unique horror film. If you understand what is happening to you while you watch it you begin to appreciate the tone the director was deliberately trying to set. The movie itself tries to break the fourth wall by pissing you off, misleading you, boring you, and fooling you until you are gasping for breath before the big finale in lockstep with Sutherland. The movie takes its sweet time winding up before slapping the viewer around in the shocking conclusion. We both want a resolution. Sutherland gets his answer. And this all succeeds remarkably well in upsetting people who don't get it judging by the reviews here! So this horror gem has that going for it. :-)Final Notes: The film isn't linear and there is the same amount of action as in The Legend of Hell House. It's almost giallo-like in an American way in it's execution. As true horror should, this film does not leave one with a happy feeling that the world is saved. It's ambiguous, uncertain, and does not go the way you think it will. There are also plenty of production stories to fuel interest in this long-lost horror gem. If this sounds interesting, don't read any more reviews which could give away the surprise ending. For mature horror fans, check out Don't Look Now.",Don't Look Now VHS

378802,"In what amounts to a riveting detective story, this pearl of a film appears to have been dwarfed by other 20th Century Fox releases of the time.  Without a doubt, the template of a young aeronautical engineer - specializing in metallurgic forensics - stumbling upon what could be proof of catastrophic structural fatigue that could result in the deaths of airline passengers was a clear ticket for American actor, Jimmy Stewart. Playing the introverted and absent-minded Theodore Honey, Stewart's character is trying to convince the hierarchy of the Royal Aircraft Establishment that their most recent entry into the civil passenger livery may be seriously flawed.  The four-engine, turbo-prop Reindeer passenger plane is prone to cataclysmic vibration harmonics in the tail empennage after approximately 1440 hours of flying time.  At least, this is what it appears to be on paper to Mr. Honey who is waiting on actual testing of the tail structure to bear his hypothesis out. In the meantime, the Reindeer fly.  One of the passenger planes has already crashed in Labrador and there may be evidence that it experienced a catastrophic tail separation before plummeting to the ground. The Director of the Establishment's Metallurgic Department, Sir John - played by Ronald Squire - insists that Mr. Honey be on the investigation team that goes to the crash site.  In the meantime, Sir John's understudy, Dennis Scott - played by Jack Hawkins - gets some unique insight into the rather odd, yet talented, Mr. Honey.  Honey, a Rhodes Scholar, is a widower with a young daughter, Elspeth - played with invigorating charm and youthful innocence by Janette Scott. Having lost his wife, Mary, during the war, Honey - among his many interests and endeavors, has struggled to raise a young 12 year old woman into the world, whose intellectual capacity and interests rival those of her father - yet, has had little exposure to a normal childhood. In a moment of discovery at Mr. Honey's tenement, Dennis Scott looks over the many stacked books in Honey's library and littered about the house.  A singular small book deals with raising a child, which speaks oceans about Honey's understanding of the subject - he mentions to Scott that he doesn't entirely agree with the book!Honey leaves England aboard a passenger plane that turns out to be one of the planes which he is investigating - a Reindeer.  We are introduced to a number of significant characters - a flight attendant, Marjorie Corder, ably and passionately played by Glynis Johns, and a sultry actress (""sultry"" being all too clich&eacute;), Monica Teasdale, played with the reverent precision of Marlene Dietrich.  Liall MacGinnis plays the pilot, Captain Samuelson, in an un-credited role.  Kenneth More, also in an un-credited role, plays the co-pilot, Dobson. The flight is key to the story - as Mr. Honey, identified as a company employee and prominent engineer, is given a brief courtesy tour of the aircraft and speaks with the flight engineer, garnering information that this particular Reindeer has accrued a little more than 1420 hours of flight time - closely approaching the window of vulnerability that Honey has predicted with this calculations - 1440 hours... Nervous to say the least, Honey asks to speak to the Captain and asks that he turn back now - indicating his professional understanding of the Reindeer design flaw.  Samuelson is skeptical, not having heard of any such problem through normal airline channels.  But, it appears that he can't entirely ignore this warning.  Honey explains that he is headed to Gander as part of an investigation team looking into the crash of a Reindeer wherein the tail section was not discovered with the bulk of the wreckage...suggesting that it separated before its fateful plunge.  When Samuelson suggests that they go back and look at the structure of the internal tail assembly  - looking for fissures or other signs of stress, Honey mentions, that this event will be all of a sudden...one moment the structure will be perfectly fine, then suddenly, the character of the metal will change - resulting in catastrophic separation...the plane will descend into the sea and they will all be killed.  Samuelson considers this and states that he will make a call to get advice and will shut down the inboard engines in order to minimize vibration.  From this, we gather that he is somewhat receptive as one would hope any human being responsible for the lives of others would be.  Flight attendant Corder and Actress Teasdale are deeply touched when Mr. Honey reveals to them just where in the aircraft they are most likely to survive the initial impact into the sea, should they experience the inevitable tail separation.  It appears that their safety is of paramount importance.The Reindeer uneventfully lands in Gander and within an instant, all of those who were convinced in Honey's vision of disaster, are simply relieved to be on the ground, and doubt that his prediction had any merit to begin with - but, the flight will soon resume on its second leg to Montreal.  Honey is treated with indignation and placed in flight attendant Corder's custody while the Captain asks for a thorough inspection of the Reindeer.  Both Corder and Teasdale are determined to resume with the continuing flight.  Honey is a man of conviction and is determined to see that this Reindeer can't continue.  SPOILER ALERT! To emphasize his determination to obtain the appropriate audience, Mr. Honey is able to make his way into the Reindeer cockpit and hits the landing gear retraction lever.  The Reindeer crumples to the tarmac - damaged and no longer air-worthy.  ""Now, I've done it!"", Honey exclaims...Back in England, Miss Teasdale and Miss Corder visit the Honey residence, sympathetically, to look after Elspeth while her father - whose fate is uncertain - undergoes grilling and psychiatric evaluation.  In the meantime, his experiment with the static vibration testing of an exemplar Reindeer tail-plane continues.  In the apex of suspense, Honey must attend a meeting of the Board of Directors who will consider his fate.  Miss Corder decides that she will marry Mr. Honey who, obviously, needs just a little help and guidance. The speech Mr. Honey makes in defense is actions in Gander is priceless with its Jimmy Stewart twang - reminiscent of his many fine performances where he stands up for himself.  While the testing of the Reindeer tail has exceeded his calculations in terms of time anticipated to fail, Mr. Honey resigns from the Establishment. A report reaches the Establishment that the repaired Reindeer from Gander experienced a catastrophic tail failure upon landing in England - just as Honey receives this message at his testing facility - his test bears out his theory -  This is an absorbing film with great acting and very good special effects for the time period.",No Highway In The Sky VHS

1522448,"Don't let the heading fool you, it may be a Judi Dench movie, but this is one hell of an enjoyable movie to watch.So why do I call it the Judi Dench movie? Well, it's mainly about M and Bond just happens to be a part of it.The general theme of this movie is that M, M16, and Bond himself are being outclassed by a more modern and sophisticated enemy. Rather than have someone who can infiltrate and shoot the crap out of bad guys, they need operatives who can hack computers and stop digital terrorists from taking over.Okay, what's great and what's not so great about this movie? Let's go:GREAT:- Action scenes are absolutely fun to watch.- The one-liners are great.- We get to see a bit of Bond's origins.- There's a lot of character development for Bond and M.- The final battle scene ties up the movie nicely and is oh so fitting for the theme of the film.- Well acted, and Judi Dench is a pleasure to see in action.The -not- so great:- The villain was said to be a ""brilliant"" agent. But he does nothing to show why he's brilliant, except being able to hack and plan things. I was expecting him to at least show off some martial arts skills or incredible marksmanship. NOPE!- Why do director's insist on putting bad wigs on Javier Bardem?- I didn't really understand why something in the villains mouth could change his facial appearance. They make no reference as to what it is or even try to explain it.- The final confrontation with the villain is VERY anticlimactic.- The characterization of the villain felt inconsistent. One moment he's ready to kill M, in the next, well... you'll see for yourself at the end of the movie.- The way Javier Bardem portrayed the villain, made him seem rather weak. Just everything about him felt feeble, like he could easily be bested. This is inconsistent with everyone saying how this guy was the most bad ass agent that ever lived.- Bond Women, were under used. Probably could have done the whole movie without them, which is a shame.- Q didn't give any cool gadgets! Come on!I know there's a lot of negatives on this list, but really this was a great movie that had great action and humor sprinkled in all the right places.",Skyfall

And they deliver in spades with this set. It's the biggest, baddest collection of old, public domain cartoons you could buy.If you were a child (or a parent) in the 80s, you probably remember these cheap VHS tapes full of Mighty Mouse, Betty Boop, Superman, Popeyes, Three Stooges, etc cartoons. These were not Disney, Warner Bros or MGM, but they were cheap. Well, this set pretty much has every cartoon from those sets combined in this massive 12-disc set.Possibly worth it for The Three Stooges alone. Most of the 42 cartoons are here, and they do include the live action bits that sandwich the cartoon every episode. The stooges here are Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly-Joe DeRita as the third stooge. The stooges voice themselves in the cartoons as well as star in the live-action bits before and after the cartoon.Definitely worth it if you want a nostalgic cartoon collection for yourself, or a cheap collection for your kids.By the way, these are VHS transfers, and that's the best you'll ever find these cartoons.

The supporting cast in all of the films is outstanding with actors like Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, George Raft, Raymond Massey, Ida Lupino, Claude Raines, and Ann Sheridan, to mention just a few.  The story in each film is crisp and the storylines move quickly, aided by excellent directing.  Action scenes are done to underscore key elements of the plot, aided by music that dramatizes the events.

1653449,"There are some intriguing elements to this film, though most of them overrun one another. Presented by WWE Films and from the director of The Midnight Meat Train, NO ONE LIVES has a cast of talented character actors: the very lovely Laura Ramsey, the always memorable Lee Tergesen, Gary Grubbs and genre-staple America Olivo. However, none of the actors are given the chance to shine due to a sore lack of character development. This movie felt more like a sequel than an introductory tale. The back story of Evans' ""Driver"" and the women in his life would have made for a far more interesting story, especially given the chemistry that existed between Luke Evans, Laura Ramsey and Adelaide Clemens, whose work I was previously unfamiliar with.The gore is excessive and the cinematography unremarkable, serving only to dilute the stronger points of first-timer David Cohen's script and borrowing more than once from Ted Demme's Silence of the Lambs visuals. The script is chocked full of familiar catchphrases, which standout even more given the sparse amount of dialogue. The humor is occasional but works, thanks to the effortlessness Luke Evans conveys in the lead role and a well-choreographed, if not misplaced, ""chick fight"". I'd suggest this as a rental but viewers might wait a year or two in hopes that it becomes an Amazon Prime freebie.",No One Lives

1572424,"{3.5 stars}An interesting combination of qualities: Some will call it a winning one; some will call it otherwise.SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK doesn't quite work as a conventional comedy because it just *isn't all that funny. As a drama about mental illness, it falls short because it tries too hard to be funny, and the lead characters are such stereotypical bipolars. In either case, the scenes of violence are horribly fake. As a kind of funny-serious social satire on how everyone, along with the society they create and inhabit, is nuts, this film works VERY well, even if it does take some time to develop.The first half drags and is a bit unfocused; moreover, it seems overwrought with acting, script, and directions that try a bit too hard to portray crazy people. I found it very frustrating but soon discovered that it provided good set-up for the second half. There is also some nice and subtle foreshadowing here regarding the craziness of Pat (Cooper)'s family and all the other supposedly normal people in the film. While Jennifer Lawrence (as Tiffany) over-acts--just as Cooper does-- it helps to elucidate the less stereotypical side of her in the second half. Her script--see the line I've used as my title--and entire character contribute a great deal to this film. The second half is also sometimes repetitive and unfocused, but the whole theme really shines through, and it could not end any better. Tiffany and Pat's dance scene is riveting (and I'll admit, pretty funny).In the end, it's fitting that a film about craziness follows such a crazy structure.*Many obviously disagree with me on whether or not this film is truly funny.

898294,"I will state flat out that I truly disliked this film, the plot, the music, and the directorship.  As a fan of western films, I highly anticipated watching this one, but was sorely disappointed on so many levels.  The plot has so much potential, but in my view, it is wasted, and the film drifts like a vessel which has lost its rudder.  The film boasts an all-star cast in Heston, Hutton, Harris, Coburn, Ben Johnson, and many others, but even with this great talent, the film is so disjointed and confusing, even this all-star cast cannot save it.  The battle scenes are perhaps the worst element of the film.  The scenes are shot primarily at night so it is hard to clearly see the action, and then there are so many brief shots pieced together that one cannot possibly determine who is shooting who, who got hit, or even who is winning the battle.  I suppose battles are like this in reality, but these are perhaps the worst battle scenes I have ever seen in a movie.  The musical score is inappropriate at times, and at other times downright annoying. I'd rather hear nothing than this drab score.Director Sam Peckinpah had a lot to work with in terms of script and cast, but in my view he completely mismanaged both.  Major Dundee is a major disappointment.  While others rate this western in their top-25 list of all-time greats, it does not even budge the arrow on my Richter Scale.kone",N/A

I love cartoons from most every studio and era, from Looney Tunes up through the ""limited"" animation styles of the 60's.  But no one made 'em like the Fleischers in their pioneering early days.  Along with the studio's early Popeye shorts, the Betty Boop's are simply some of the most creative, zany, funny, and (let's face it) weird short films ever committed to celluloid.A few others have complained about Olive Film's plans to release the cartoons in four single-disc sets, with a dozen cartoons per set.  I assume the studio is doing this to test the waters, and be sure there is a market for the DVD's before they make them all.  But even if, on a more cynical note, it's just to make more money. . .who cares?  The target audience for these films WILL buy them all, and I for one am grateful to Olive and Paramount for investing in this long-neglected property.As for the A/V quality, both are almost uniformly excellent.  Anyone who's suffered through bootleg tapes, discs, or scratchy Youtube videos of these cartoons will be delighted at the clear and vibrant images.

Rivers' sister also had a little boy, Raymond Torres (Mason Lucero), and Rivers says she wants justice for him too. McCaleb agrees, much to the consternation of his cardiologist, Dr Bonnie Fox (Anjelica Huston). To help him get around McCaleb hires his neighbour boat-owner, Jasper `Buddy' Noone (Jeff Daniels). There are various red herrings in the investigation but the story is resolved convincingly in the end. There's also plenty of action - too much for someone with a new heart! But it's like a milder version of the Dirty Harry movies.",Blood Work

261810,"This movie brings back a lot of memories. When it was first shown in my hometown the Boy Scout troop I was in had been awarded the ""Spellbound"" trophy and the troop was awarded the trophy at a showing of the movie. I don't even remember what it was we had done to win the award but we had won it and the members of the troop got to see the movie free at the time the award was given.To the best of my recollection I have not seen it again until last night when I watched it after so many years. Needless to say most of the story had been forgotten but the theme music was still vivid in my memory; as a music lover the hauntingly beautiful music from this movie had never been too far from my memory.The story is a murder mystery set with a strong psychological twist; a reminder of the heady days of psychoanalysis from the 1930's and 40's. The story is set in Green Manors, a mental hospital in Vermont at the time a new director, Dr. Anthony Edwards, is reporting for duty. The new director, played by Gregory Peck quickly begins to exhibit some strange symptoms which alarm the staff at the hospital. One of the staff doctors, Dr. Constance Petersen, played by Ingrid Bergman, begins to develop an interest in the new director and his condition.As the mystery surrounding Dr. Edwards begins to deepen, Dr. Petersen's interest in his case begins to grow. Most of the movie is involved with her efforts to help Dr. Edwards and her conviction that she can help him with her training in psychoanalysis. When the mystery seems to involve murder her conviction of his innocence holds strong and she commits herself to proving he is not guilty of murder.Alfred Hitchcock brings plenty of suspense into the movie to the extent the viewer feels the life of Dr. Petersen may be in danger from Dr. Edwards. The movie held our attention throughout and kept us wondering how it was going to be resolved; I did not remember the end nor did I guess ""who did it.""

1343498,"This really is a first class murder mystery thriller. Its a bit confusing at times and a bit slow at first before you feel truly connected to it. Once it gets moving and you have some idea whats going on its a pretty intruiging fiim. Production values, acting, cinematography, script, direction etc. are all top notch. This really is oscar calliber stuff falling just a little short of being considered a classic. One thing that misled me a bit were the raving reviews across the board from fellow members who are often not apt to give away good reviews on films that are ones I realy loved. Here the reviews are so positive that this film is praised on this site nearly as greatly as The Godfather is. The rave reviews had me expecting a little more, none the less I was not the least bit dissapointed in this movie. It does have some minor weaknesses I should point out (if they can be called weaknesses). The over all story is a very familiar one. American films have beaten to death movies with a similar tag line, aka- Investigative reporter meets spunky goth girl, and together they solve a murder mystery that spans decades. Only this one is a little longer than the usual film of this type and a bit more complicated. Judging from member reviews I was expecting this film to be a lot more graphic than it was. Also I feel the title of the film and book just dont seem to fit well. Maybe it sounds better in Swedish, I dont know. All this aside I can pretty much promise that if you dont mind subtitles and give the film time to build you will be greatly rewarded by the end.",N/A

Why did I make this list? Because I want to mention the fact that I LOVE HORROR MOVIES. But This franchise known as Paranormal Activity is crap. Part one consists of some lame noises, and a fire. Its barely worth your time if youve actually read up on the paranormal such as The Demonologist by Ed and Lorraine Warren. By the way I am an atheist, but even you can still enjoy the such a book, or another book such as Dark Sacrement, or a tv series like A Haunting for the fear factor. This movie invokes none of the fear that the TV show A Haunting, or the books I have mentioned does. Even the old music television show FEAR was scarier then this crap. You could enjoy the legends. If you want to be scared, go read one of the books ive mentioened. They have more books like that in the links section. If you want to see a lame bump in the night movie then this is it for you.

When I finally had the opportunity to watch The Hobbit, I was very disappointed; I was confused by how disjointed the movie is. It starts out as sort of a Hobbit: The Musical and introduces us to the main cast of characters, none of whom really distinguish themselves enough for me to identify their personalities. The adventure has a slow start and never gained enough steam to keep me interested. Even the special effects, which were so seamless in the LOTR trilogy, didn't have the same quality. I have not read Tolkein's The Hobbit, so maybe I would have enjoyed this movie more if I had, but I hadn't read The Fellowship of the Ring when I first saw that adaptation, and was able to love it.

Well, I enjoyed this movie. It's just that I do not know where I stand in this issue anymore, but to go straight to the point, I thought the love between Zach and Shaun was very beautiful. Zach has this glow when he's with Shaun, which I love seeing (especially when they cuddle & kiss and they play Shane Mack's Lie To Me). The movie is romantic and funny and has some drama, which works for me. I just don't understand why Zach's sister is keeping a guy that clearly doesn't like her son and little boys shouldn't be starting cars (at the beginning Zach told Cody to go and start his car).

400090,"I was underwhelmed by every aspect of this animated feature.  The plot held very little intrigue (when it could be understood).  Cybernetic cops are after an unseen villain called The Puppet Master.  Several dubious agencies on the fringe are also involved.  But not much in the way of suspense is maintained.  Everything is handled on an apathetic level.  All the characters are uniformly flat (in more ways than one).  One character does more than just bare her soul (Major Motoko Kusanagi), at the most bizarre moments she suddenly strips naked and carries on with her duties that apparently just involve a lot of shooting, running, and dodging bullets, when she's not standing stock still and carrying on internal conversations.  Half of this film is stationary.  Just when you think you're dealing with a glitch in your DVD player, something moves.  For an animated film, very little of it is actually animated/active.  The backgrounds are fixed, there's little action to be had until a scene shifts to a shootout.  It's all rather blas&eacute;.  To make matters worse, there are two extended, as in very long, musical interludes (one's a song, the other's just noise passing for music; both are arbitrary to the plot).  I know this is supposed to be a hallmark Anime film but I've seen (and kept for future viewing) better examples.

And while the story feels authentic, and unfolds with some unexpected twists, it feels compromised and the ending feels rushed.  Background info on the production indicates that indeed some compromises and last moment changes were made to the story and it feels that way.  This could have been either much more twisted and eerie without any particular moral stance, or much more convincingly played as a clash of two belief systems, but in the end the opportunity was lost to some hamfisted and rather trite choices.Still, a very good looking movie and quite enjoyable to watch, enough so that I initially gave it four stars just because it looks so damned good.  I was hoping for another story equal to The Name of the Rose and ended up with a 1960s Hammer Films type of melodrama - lush, lovely, moody and a bit hokey and trite.","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

Kudos for the mostly black cast. The initial scene of the white guy coming over the sand dune is worked well. For a minute I felt like I was watching some high definition video. But getting into the story we have a plane crash. Our white hero makes it to shore.The white hero goes into the jungle. He eventually finds a broken down but fixable truck. Here the white guy meets up with the black guy. Together the two travel the country in an old truck. Zombies were everywhere. I thought the story being set in Africa was quite a good take on the undead genre.The acting is quite good even if the plot leaves one wondering.

They take a helicopter to a mountain, then walk to a beach (a nice wide one where a helicopter could land) then take a boat to an island. Plot continuity was not part of the plan.

1611492,"CAUTION: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWAlthough I am only 65 years old, most of the people I was close to as a child have died in the past four years, including my closest first cousin (only a month older than me), both of my parents, and my mother's two sisters, who were like auxiliary mothers. We were a very close extended family, all living within two miles of each other until I left home at 18. With the exception of my father, all of those people died in much the same way as Anne did in this movie, but in a much more nightmarish setting, in hospitals and hospices rather than at home, and with an extra kick of morphine at the end instead of a pillow.But dying for all of them was ugly, protracted and humiliating, no less awful than it was for Anne... and FAR more expensive. The worst was my mother, who had Alzheimer's for 21 years before she died and went through for all those years what Anne went through in the few weeks or months this movie covers (note that the season doesn't change). If my father and others had not spoon-fed her (exactly as Georges did with Anne) every meal every day for the last fifteen years of her life, she would have died much sooner and much more humanely.The effect of all that horror on me was to make me determined that I was NOT going to end my life that way. I'll spare you some of the tiresome details and just say that I did everything I could to prevent it, including a health care proxy, a living will, a very restrictive MOLST form (a wonderful, sort of expanded ""Do Not Resuscitate"" form available to New York State residents - a legal document which specifies what kinds of treatment medical professionals are legally allowed to give me) and making clear to my remaining relatives and friends that I did not want to be resuscitated or ever receive any kind of life-extending treatment, but be allowed to die as quickly and as naturally as possible.I got DNR bracelets, lanyard things so I can wear my MOLST around my neck 24 hours, in case I collapse in a supermarket or somewhere, and a bunch of other crap. I got pretty paranoid about being kept alive after my body wears out, which is the norm in today's world. I've had a wonderful life, but I have no desire at all to extend it. Sixty-five years is plenty.Despite all my efforts to ward off the kind of death I saw around me and later in this movie, I never could relax and quit fretting about it. I was just sure something would get screwed up and I'd end up just like all the rest, lying mindless and helpless in diapers in some motorized bed with tubes stuck in me everywhere and people all around trying to keep me alive until they got tired of it and upped the morphine. What this marvelous movie did is take away that anxiety. I don't know how, exactly, but it did it.After seeing what happened to Anne in this movie, and through that remembering in a different way what it was like for my relatives, I realized that I'm okay with it now. It's okay now if I DO end up like that - because, even if it lasts for decades as it did with Mama, eventually it'll be over, and that's all that really matters.If it takes me ten seconds to die or twenty years to die, I'll still die, and nothing can prevent it. That is profoundly comforting to me, and it allows me to scrap the MOLST and all the other voodoo fetishes I had gathered around me and relax. I have no idea how watching this movie gave me this totally unexpected freedom, but I have no doubt that it did.--------This review originated as a post on the IMDb message board for this movie, in a thread titled ""Do elderly people like this movie?""

For me, it was a lot of fun watching Anthony Hopkins and Helen Miren in their roles.  It also was great seeing Michael Wincott back as the killer, Ed Glein.  I knew a good bit about Psycho the novel, and a little on the making of the movie.  This film just filled in the pieces for me.My complaint isn't with the film, but rather with how the DVDs were packaged.  If you own a regular DVD player, the only way to see the film is to buy the Blue Ray Edition with the regular DVD included.  You therefore pay a higher cost for the movie.  Then, when you search for extras on the DVD, the only thing you find are trailers for other movies.  All the extras are on the Blue Ray Edition, and you can't watch a Blue Ray disc in a regular DVD player, so you're screwed.I won't fall for this type of marketing again.  I'll simply wait a year or two for the price to come down and then purchase it.  Of course, the movie will probably be out on television by then.",Hitchcock

1346124,"If you are a fan of the Howling series, you probably already own these movies. For those who have not seen the many lesser sequels to Dante's excellent 1981 original, all I can say is, watch with caution. None of the films offered here are masterpieces (I would argue that Part V is as close as you're going to get to perfection in the series and even this sequel is far from perfect) and all suffer greatly from the typical elements that plague these types of productions, stiff acting, low budget, inferior effects work and sadly for a werewolf movie, really cheesy transformation scenes. The team for ""Howling V - The Rebirth"" were smart and decided not to visualize what they obviously didn't have the budget to produce.Interestingly enough, this set excludes the fourth film in the series, ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"", and goes from number III to V and VI. In my opinion, these 3 are the better sequels so it's only for the better. For those that would like to watch the awful chapter IV, can purchase it individually. It is recommended since movies this bad are sometimes very entertaining but be warned, it stinks. Now, moving on to the movies included on this DVD.The Howling III: The Marsupials  **The second sequel in the series is a wild, sometimes amusing and totally obnoxious film that never takes itself seriously. The main character is the beautiful Jerboa, a marsupial werewolf (who appear to have evolved from the Thylacine) who flees her village and goes to the city where she is cast in a low-budget creature feature. Meanwhile an Australian anthropologist, who has archival film footage from the turn of the century depicting Australian Aborigines sacrificing and killing a werewolf, is convinced the world is being plagued by these hairy monsters. The plot is rather convoluted and although the sequel is amusing at times, it is not always successful as it suffers tremendously from its low budget and childish story. It tries to be creative during its many transformation scenes but they never quite turn out and the werewolves themselves looks rather silly and nowhere near as ferocious as those depicted in Dante's classic. Also, the film is too tongue and cheek so it is not scary in the least. There is no atmosphere, no sense of dread or fear. The original film used horror and humor splendidly while ""Howling III"" over-does it and is more of a parody than an actual horror movie. If you view this as campy entertainment, you may be entertained by it. Definitely do not view this expecting a horror film. If it's horror and shocks you want, you're better off watching a rerun of ""Roseanne"". It is definitely superior to the atrocious first sequel ""Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf"" and the sequel that followed ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"" but overall a very disappointing picture.The Howling V - The Rebirth  ***This fifth entry is hands down the best sequel in the series. If you have seen parts II, III and the poorly done IV, do not expect to find that level of awfulness here as the makers of this film actually delivered in making a good, solid who-dun-it with a werewolf twist.The film starts in medieval times as a mass murder/suicide is taking place. As the victims lay dying on the floor of their castle, a baby is heard crying in the background. Fast forward 500 years later and several individuals, ranging from a doctor, tennis player, a struggling actress, a successful actress, a photographer etc, are summoned to attend the re-opening of a glorious castle in Budapest. At first, it is all fun and interesting conversations but it soon turns threatening when some of the guests begin disappearing and those remaining begin to suspect that something sinister is at play. When some of the victims are found with their throats ripped out, the mysterious Count, who summoned them, reveals the true motive for their gathering. They are all descendants from a werewolf bloodline and they all bear the mark of the beast - a birthmark on their arm, and one of them is indeed a werewolf. They were attempting to single out the beast and to kill it before it kills all and to stop the werewolf bloodline.This nifty little shocker is devoid of intense gore and any werewolf transformation scenes but it is without a doubt, the best in the series besides the original. It is obviously a low budget production but the film team didn't have this hinder their imagination and went around their many obstacles and gave us much needed suspense, something terribly lacking in all of the sequels, a very chilling atmosphere, a good, creepy score, and they manage to squeeze some good performances from most of the cast. For the reviewers who criticize this entry for having bad performances must have not seen the previous (""Howling II"" and ""IV"") and later installments (""Howling 7"" is awful on every level). Most of the actors in this sequel are great in comparison and since there is much more character development here, we end up actually caring for some of these unfortunate souls. Many cite the lack of werewolves in the movie as its main problem. I personally do not think this is an issue at all. I would prefer seeing glimpses of the monster, it's claws, it's angry snarl, it's wicked eyes and in one scene, its hairy silhouette complete with elongated fingernails, than an atrocious B-movie monster in all of its low budget, laughable glory. What we do see of the creature, is good and at least ""The Rebirth"" cannot be criticized for displaying for prolonged periods of screen time an awful looking, rubber creature.""Howling V: The Rebirth"" is not as good or as frightening as the original but in comparison to the other sequels, this one shines above them all as a solid piece that is generally well made with some great location shots, atmosphere, suspense and a rather peculiar, surprise ending. It is not perfect since the pacing is a bit slow and when scrutinized, plot holes are evident but these minor issues are easy to overlook when the rest of the sequels are so darn awful. This fifth entry holds up well and it deserves, at least, a view.Howling VI: The Freaks  **After a good, solid entry with ""The Rebirth"", the franchise took another nose-dive with ""The Freaks"". Although it is not the worst of the sequels, again, I have to cite II, IV, and VII since they stand out in their awfulness, this entry is still disappointing. It lacks suspense and scares and although this one tries to resurrect the werewolf transformation scene, it does so unsuccessfully and the end result is a werewolf that simply looks like a very tall, ugly man with body hair issues.The story centre's around Ian, a charming drifter who takes a job at a local church. This mysterious loner harbors a dark secret. You see, when the moon is full, he transform in to a hairy sasquatch .. I mean werewolf. Meanwhile, a travelling carnival arrives in town and one of its showcases is its freak-show complete with an alligator boy, a he-she, a three armed man and a clown who likes to chew off the heads of chickens (didn't see that one coming). The owner of this freak-show is R.B. Harker, a tall, masculine blonde with a flowing mane that would look great in a Harlequin romance novel cover and who also has a dark secret of his own. It is revealed that he is a loathsome, evil vampire who unmercifully exploits the freaks he takes under his wing. Harker, who is aware of Ian's secret, and can initiate a transformation by simply chanting some words, uses Ian as part of his carnival freak-show display. The sasquatch, ...  I mean werewolf here is the good guy and the climax is a showdown between Good and Evil. The idea is an interesting one and ""Howling VI"" pre-dates the current batch of werewolf vs vampire themed films such as the ""Twilight"" and ""Underworld"" saga. I just wished this had a bigger budget so more could have been accomplished. ""The Freaks"" is ambitious but rather clumsy and there are far too many quirky characters that it becomes a bit tiresome. The transformation scene is better than previous and later sequels, (""Howling II"", ""III"", ""IV"" and ""VII"" had cheesy man-to-wolf transformations), but where this one drops the ball is in the actual snout-less sasquatch... I mean, werewolf. At least give the beast a snout. This is not 1941. In this day and age, even by early 90's standards, we expect more from a cinematic werewolf than some contact lenses and glued on hair.Although far from being the worst, ""Howling VI: The Freaks"" will only amuse those undiscriminating horror fans with low expectations. Which is disappointing considering this had all of the potential of being a great entry in the series.""Howling Trilogy - Triple Feature"" does not include any extras, not even the trailers. All you get are the movies themselves along with their chapter selection so do not expect much. The quality of the films are very disappointing. The three movies show their age and unfortunately nothing was done to clean them up. This is especially true of the ""The Rebirth"". The transfer is sub-standard, looks grainy in several parts and the picture quality looks no better than the 20 year old VHS tape I originally had. For the price, this set is good enough.

Like the 2000 Japanese movie &#8220;Battle Royale,&#8221; to which it bears some resemblance, &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; works because it hits that sweet spot where classical myth meets contemporary anxiety to become a pop mind-blower.",N/A

1662567,"Opener: If you ask me, I coudn't wait for this set to be released & have the 1st 4 series' in HD, well upconverted HD, but whatever. I love this series as much as I enjoy Star Trek & I'm a guy who enjoys his Star Trek. Pretty much I'm a Trekkie & a Whovian, have been for several years. I was stoked for this release, hope they'll release the series in separate releases like the Friends season sets on blu-ray & the DVD series sets of Power Rangers.Content review: Now, if you want entertainment at its best, you've come to the right place. Most of Matt Smith's, all of David Tennant's, & some of Chris Eccelston's episodes are truly great & will keep you entertained for hours.Remastering work: It's too bad they didn't shoot the episodes from series' 1-4 on film, or an equivalent for proper HD remastering, but like 'The Next Doctor' episode of the David Tennant specials that looked ok & that episode was upconverted, so you don't have to worry much. I'm hopeful that they'll release the upconverted HD versions of the episodes on iTunes &/or Netflix so people who can't afford this set, will be able watch them that way. I expected the SD produced episodes & such on the discs to look close to the episodes of Sherlock in HD. They look good, they've also remixed the audio for series 2, which I've heard that people have complained about, that the music overlapped the speech to the point where you can barely hear the speech, so much so that it was spoofed on the British comedy show 'Dead Ringers,' so they probably took that into account when remastering the show. The picture isn't 'Star Trek TNG' Blu-Ray level, but it's alright. The episodes of series 1-4 look decent, but not overly fantastic, but there is a level of remastering there, to a degree. Whether, or not it's exactly 1080p HD, is a question, but they were shot at 576i, so they're definitely above 480p, so it has that, but it also looks nice, so don't think it's crap. You'd definitely have to take a lot of things into account when thinking about buying this set, like me, who didn't have the DVDs & thought this was a good bargain for all included.Price: I consider the price fair. $299-$314 for around 3 Doctor's worth of tenure, spread over 7 series' on almost 40 discs, which has episodes, shorts, & other extras from the DVDs, which I'm questioning if the mini-sodes were upconverted too, for series' 1-4's mini-sodes, & an 11th Doctor sonic screwdriver universal remote, which I understand, goes for nearly $100 on its own. As I've read someone type into a review for this set & am repeating cause it's true, each individual series from 1-4 & 7 on DVD, is going for the insanely high prices of $40-$60 & that's just the DVD versions. I could easily understand a new release & on blu-ray, but on DVD!?! Really Amazon!?! Well, at least it's not as bad as BBC America's site. They're selling it for nearly $100, at least for series 2, but I digress.Final thoughts, for now: As far as I can tell, as it says on this page, it has all the shorts, the Doctor Who Confidential episodes from the DVD releases, & most importantly, the episodes from series 1-4, at least. I was kind of hoping they'd release the Dreamland CGI episode from 2009 and The Infinite Quest animated episode, on these too, since there's a bonus disc, or since Blu-Ray discs hold more info than DVDs, they could slot those episodes where they belong, continuity-wise, in between the episodes they take place in, but I guess I was just hoping for something impossible, or at least very unlikely to happen. As I was hoping that since Dreamland hasn't been released anywhere, not even iTunes of all places, or the David Tennant Specials blu-rays in HD, they could've released it for the 1st time anywhere in HD on blu-ray & give us fans &/or collectors extra incentive to buy this set, but I guess BBC was not smart enough to realize the opportunity they had here, but I guess not..Final Thoughts: It's a pretty good set release of this show. Solid for a collection release before The Day Of The Doctor on November 23. I have no complaints, as I mainly bought this set to get the episodes on disc format, since the DVD season sets are so expensive, so I recommend this set: 1, for people who didn't buy the series sets yet & 2, if you, like me, hate the series 5 & 6, maybe 7 set releases, if it's like those, & want the discs in regular, great blu-ray cases with multiple disc trays, so there's that. Otherwise, I don't think it's going to appeal to you very much.Not much else to say, so thanks for reading, if you did.Oh, & P.S. for anyone living in the U.K. thinking this is unfair that we get this before you, you people have gotten the Regeneration box set & we didn't, so this is ours & we'll enjoy having a leg up over you, so don't spoil it.

973337,"For whatever reason, I didn't watch KofTH when it aired on Fox for so many seasons.  Now its my favorite show, and Season 6 is my most favorite. The last two episodes about the trip to Japan are hilarious, but they also teach a lesson about tolerance.  The episode about the Renaissance Fair is pure satire.  The animation on all of the episodes, specifically Peggy Hill, is ingenious the way Peggy's facial expressions consistently reflect her feelings at the time. The humor, for the most part, is in good taste considering the topics that are highlighted; e.g., Bobby working as an apprentice animal feces remover.  I probably wouldn't recommend the show for young children, as it could teach them some bad habits (but then, so can Sponge Bob).  My only problem is that now that I'm a fan of the show, it is no longer included in Amazon Prime, with no cost unlimited streaming. Yet, the decision to start charging for the show is likely due to contractual/cost issues, since Net Flix has removed the show completely.",King of the Hill: Season 6

I stuck it out, expecting maybe to be surprised, only to find it rather boring, trite, and repetitive with filler thrown in to give it the minimal length needed to be considered a movie and not a short. Really, the entire concept could have been done in 30  minutes instead.  I'm surprised only to find it being rated so well by other viewers.

1496926,"I watched this because I was curious to see what other acting Chris Evans had done besides certain broader roles. I saw hints of some really great acting inCaptain America: The First Avenger [HD] but I only picked up on that on subsequent viewings (his acting is really good, but it got buried in the hype of a superhero movie).In Puncture he not only carries the film, but his acting is allowed to really shine. I was really able to believe him as this character--which considering I had just rewatched Captain America, says something.He plays an attorney who's life seems to be in a bit of chaotic shambles. His wife has left him, he parties with the fringes of society and is a very, very heavy drug user. All of that being said, he is a very interesting character. He uses his friends as mock trial participants to come up with brilliant legal ideas. He is very, very smart, but just seems unable to deal with the world around him in a way that isn't self destructive.He is partners in a small law firm that helps a larger firm with cases to make ends meet. While doing this a case is brought to them about a nurse who contracted AIDS from a needle jab in the ER. She doesn't want compensation, she wants to get a needle into hospitals that a friend of hers invented. This needle would prevent an accident like hers from happening again.Mike, Chris Evans' character, is immediately touched by her story and wants to help. His partner, the more pragmatic and practical of the two, points out that they are ill equipped to take on hospitals and the medical supply industry. Mike is unable to leave the crusade alone.Its an intense movie and had me absorbed from the beginning. I was honestly skeptical when I hit play, but I really don't regret it. I wish there more movies out there like it. It is based on a true story--and it is one that should get told. It shows how money has made its way into holding people's safety hostage.If Chris Evans continues to make movies like this as well as Captain America--well, he really is going to be an actor to contend with. Watching this made me wish Netflix had more of his work to stream. He makes interesting choices with his movies, now that he has the ability to pick things and I am curious to see what else he will do.The other actors in this are all very believable, and the direction has an appropriate level of grittiness and intimacy that is needed for this story.  I also, really liked the soundtrack.",Puncture

1175368,"I am devoted fan of Burn Notice. I think season 2 is either the best or one of the best seasons. Season one saw Michael, Fiona, Sam and Madeline's characters get settled into their strides. The long term arc of the show was established to frame the trajectory of the characters. The pattern of the show is compelling with each show having a arc storyline moving the main burn notice theme forward and containing another storyline that is self-contained. Those self-contained stories are what drew me in when I discovered Burn Notice during the second season of broadcast.I am pleased with the Season 2 Blu-Ray set I purchased at Amazon. The case was sturdy and all the disks still in their mountings. The picture and sound seem superb on my Panasonic blu-ray. I feel like the player makes more difference than I would normally expect with this digital format. The set is technically fine by my viewing of the first blu-ray disk.As tv series sets go I am a little sad there aren't more ""features"". Just missing scenes from several episodes, a few commentary tracks, and a featurette I have not watched yet.  I would like to have seen outtakes, gag-reels, making-of mini-documentaries, interviews with the actors, producers, and directors, and additional background information.  The Stargate DVD sets did this sort of thing pretty well. These would add to my perceived value of the blu-ray season set vs streaming of the plain shows.Still, I love Burn Notice I can't knock the blu-ray set. It still gets 5 stars.

485800,"For all but his most ardent fans, Italian director Lucio Fulci can be somewhat of an acquired taste.  Memorable more for their gore than for coherent plotlines, Fulci's oeuvre boasts outrageous imagery that often tests the gag reflex of the most hardened horror veterans: major eyeball damage is always a threat for the characters who populate Fulci's world, as is throat ripping, flesh melting, chain flogging, head crushing, gut munching and any other other disgusting fate that can be conjured up by the human mind.  All this, and more, is on vivid display in what many fans consider to be Fulci's masterpiece, ""The Beyond"".  Certainly, ""The Beyond"" is (I think) his most lavishly baroque excursion into the grotesque, although describing it as a ""masterpiece"" might be a stretch. Since the film's 1981 release, movie special effects have come a long way, but, to be sure, the blood and gore on display here are plenty revolting, even in scenes where the moviemaker's trickery is obvious.The plot, such as it is, involves a hotel in the Louisiana bayou that is situated over one of the seven doors to hell.  In the early part of the 20th Century, a horde of angry townsfolk (who make the angry townsfolk in Universal's ""Frankenstein"" movies look like the Seven Dwarfs) track a local artist to the aforementioned hotel, where, believing him to be a warlock, torture and murder him in the grisliest manner.  Fast forward 50 or so years, when a young New Yorker named Liza inherits the hotel and sets about renovating the crumbling structure. This does not set well with the demonic residents, who immediately embark upon a course of gruesome mayhem that, somehow, goes undetected for much of the film by our heroine and her new friend, John, the local doctor.  There's a blind girl named Emily, who seems to have dropped in from some sort of limbo, essentially to set up the other characters as sacrifices, but who ends up (to her detriment) being more of a help than a hindrance.  Other characters come and go, some showing up, seemingly, for the sole purpose of dying a hideous death, and things happen that move  the story nowhere, but the atmosphere Fulci creates is genuinely creepy, and there are some evocative shots of New Orleans.  In fact, the movie, lovingly restored and presented by Anchor Bay, looks great, beautiful, in fact, in spite of the horrific murders.The performances are really not as bad as I'd feared (and heard).  Fulci regular, Catriona MacColl, gives a spirited performance as the attractively spunky (if none too bright) Liza.  Although British, MacColl makes a convincing American yuppie-type, while David Warbeck, also a Brit, plays it strait-laced to the point of being wooden, as the local doctor/hero.  Also memorable is ""Inferno's"" Veronica Lazar, as the hotel maid; with her wild hair and slovenly manner, she lurks in the shadows knowingly,  a little like Agnes Moorehead in ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"".  Cinzia Monreale, as the blind Emily, with her ominous warnings and flighty departures, makes the most of a role both sympathetic and menacing.  The rest of the players are interesting, too, although few are allotted more than a few minutes of screen time.At its best, ""The Beyond"" is like a carefully crafted, beautifully filmed nightmare that is effective and disturbing, without having a particularly coherent narrative.  However,  that is almost overridden by Fulci's penchant for lingering lovingly on gross-out scenes of carnage--sometimes for minutes at a time--which seems gratuitous, bordering on obscene.  But that's Fulci, extreme and fearless as a filmmaker, so you either take him or leave him. Having heard so much about this film through the years, I really wanted to like it more than I do.  As it is,  ""The Beyond"" has a fantastic look and feel--the atmosphere, in this case, is almost everything--but you have to possess a certain amount of patience and have a certain sensibility (not to mention, the stomach) for this kind of thing, otherwise you're not likely to appreciate it.",N/A

But now, I've come to the realization it is a moral story about how somebody who seems to need the most help couldn't be helped because, like the title says, A River Runs Through It. It's an incredible film of superb performances by Craig Sheffer, Brad Pitt, Tom Skerritt, Emily Lloyd, and Brenda Blethyn. Of course, it's nice to see the three topics of religion, Montana, and fly fishing to interweave together as a tale to be told. Although I like Ordinary People, A River Runs Through It is easily Robert Redford's best directed picture. The cinematography is a lovely touch, and of course, who couldn't in Montana?

1356236,"""Boy"" is a 2009 Philippine film from director Auraeus Solito.  It stars Aeious Asin as 'the boy', a poet and deep thinking lad who falls for the rugged macho dancer Aries. It's a classic coming of age tale, with some really remarkable film styles  - most memorable for me is the fascination with the aquariums and the background of fireworks.Our lead 'boy' begins exploring the gay bars as he comes to terms with his own sexuality. As luck would have it, he meets Aries (as Tina Turner would say ""a dancer for money"").  The two embark on a journey together, experiencing the opposite worlds from which each lad hails.  Our innocent lead boy takes the seductive dancer home - where they meet his mother, have dinner together and celebrate the arrival of the New Year together!  It's the hopeful 'love at first sight' experience.  As fireworks explode in the distant skies, the two retreat to the boys bedroom where our gentle poet boy is more interested in educating his new pal about his collection of aquariums and fish (and how the fish interact).  Eventually, the two finally become entangled as the unique camera angles capture a tasteful scene between the two boys cast through the flowing water of the aquariums!  It was definitely a first for this viewer.As expected, the macho dancer having completed his assigned task for the night, prepares to depart and quietly exits the bed and home.  Not settled with a one-night stand, our boy heads outside to find Aries on the street having a cigarette. The two lads end up heading to the dancers make-shift home in a very poor section of the city.  The contrast of lives is fully engaged.  And the common theme of opposites attract is clear.It's tantalizing, sexual, wholesome, cute, touching, romantic, gritty, and one of the more unique coming of age tales I have enjoyed.  The contrast between the boys desires, the way they live, and how life must be for other youth in the world makes this a worthwhile and recommended viewing experience. I debated between 4 or 5 stars, and realized, there was no valid reason to give it anything less than 5.The film was banned in Singapore because it ""normalizes homosexuality and romanticizes sex between men."" Solito also directed another coming of age taleThe Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros, which I have also seen, however, Boy is significantly more enjoyable.",N/A
759653,"I can not believe Susannah York was not nominated for an Oscar for ""Images.""  She most deservedly should have won in 1973 beating out Liza Minnelli.  I know first-hand about shizophrenia, having a schizoid affect, and having a best friend who was a paranoid schizophrenic, and Robert Altman's original screenplay and masterful direction coupled with Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography, all extraordinarily brilliant present the most accurate depiction on film of what it is like to have this illness.  The Academy does not know it's stuff.  The score by John Williams was the only thing it did nominate.  I sincerely thought that Susannah was nominated, having won the Cannes Film Award Best Actress award, and today after viewing the film again after a long spell, had to confirm it and remind myself of her competition.  What an oversight.  And the comparison to Polanksi's ""Repulsion"" comes as if the schizophrenia presented in his thriller were a convenient plot device for his fiction.  The artists who made ""Images"" were chillingly precise, nearly clinical, in this, an admitted fiction, like the use of a children's book, ""In Search of Unicorns"" by Ms. York, to make a stunning portrait that was miles ahead of itself.  You should catch up with it.  Never was an actress so integral to a film, better than her Oscar nom in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?""  How could this, too, be over-looked?",Images

Deb worked that role to the max and is no match for this ingenue... Charles Boyer was most handsome but a bit tooo smarmy for my tastes esp for 1939, like OOPS I have too many girlfriends vs Cary really trying to love someone wholeheartedly in his interpretration....  absolutely love this story but the 2nd version is my all time favorite, guess the iteration of a classic improves over time, recommend for those who seek the origins of the other two versions.",N/A

1589700,"It's come to a point where you can predict the responses to releases of this type from bands like Coldplay,Radiohead, REM (no more now), etc.  The concert film will have an overzealous director who doesn't believe in an attention span of more than 1 second, the sound quality will be compressed and crappy, the documentary pieces will be self aggrandizing and overstated, etc.  But when you cut through all of that, these questions remain: What about the music? What about the band? What do you feel when all is said and done? And the answer is, with all its flaws, the CD/DVD brings to the forefront the emotional power of this unique band.  The way they connect with audiences is amazing; bands like Rush come to mind.  The people who come to Coldplay concerts feel almost a religious transformation.  I know that all the tech heads, including myself, wish that audio/video decisions would be smarter, less gratuitous,and perhaps better chosen, but let's face it; this is obviously what the band felt comfortable releasing to their fans.

50091,"Yes, it's Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic, based on Michael Crichton's exciting novel, tweaked into 3D and redistributed to scare the piddle out of a whole new generation! As for creating tension and thrills, Spielberg never misses a trick; I had to smile at all his gimmicks...even as I reacted to them. Remember, clich&eacute;s became clich&eacute;s because they WORKED!A scientist finds prehistoric DNA in mosquitoes trapped in amber; from this he has cloned dinosaurs and wants to open a theme park in a highly controlled environment so children can have first-hand lessons about the Jurassic Age. He invites a small cadre of scientists and investors to tour his Caribbean Island facility, but as they tour...Oops! they have a power outage. Excitement ensues...I'll use fairly current credits, but think back, you'll remember:* Sam Neill (""The Vow"") is Dr. Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is pro-science and anti-children. He is very interested in this pro- posed theme park, he is NOT interested in marriage or children. Born in Ireland and raised in New Zealand, Neill works all the time.* Laura Dern (""The Master"") is Dr. Ellie Sattler, a botanist who works with Dr. Grant. This scientist is interested in both children AND marriage. Daughter of Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, she is another professional who has acted all her life. She looks so young here!* Jeff Goldblum (""The Switch"" and ""Portlandia"") is Dr. Ian Malcom, who questions the wisdom of trying to override nature's method of extinction. I had forgotten what a hunk he was (and still is).* Richard Attenborough (""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"") is John Hammond, a scientist who dreams of using dinosaur DNA to create clones for a theme park. This multi-talented actor/producer/director is one of Britain's most honored professionals.* Samuel L. Jackson (""The Avengers"") is Ray, one of the tech- nicians at the theme park. Along with other achievements in his varied career, Jackson has gone on to become a mainstay of Marvel's Superhero series.* Ariana Richards (""Jurassic Park"" trilogy and lots of TV) is the terrified big sister, Lex. After decades of television work, Miss R. has a new movie, ""Battledogs,"" scheduled out this year.* Joseph Mazzello (""The Social Network"") is all grown up now, his adventurous little 1993 Tim, a distant memory. Mr. M. has managed to work a college degree into his busy schedule.* Wayne Knight (Lots of TV) is the scalawag who tries to steal prehistoric embryos from the labratory. It is his rear-view mirror that cautions ""Objects may be closer than they appear"" when he spots a T-Rex in pursuit of his jeep.Some of us today think ""Thesaurus"" is a dinosaur, so maybe we need to brush up. Remember those velociraptors hunting the children in that kitchen? For some reason, that indelible scene has stayed with me all these years. Spielberg made a memorable movie in 1993 and now, 20 years later, it's fun to visit it again. One big difference: Today's children have their bladders set for a commercial break every 10 minutes or so (Ah, television); there was an annoying stream of school children sneaking in and out during the film.It's PG-13, so expect humor, suspense, violence (dinosaurs eating each other), bits of corpses (human and otherwise, with very little blood), and everything else Spielberg can throw at you. Just remember, this was terrific in 1993 when it was in 2D, so there is really no need for the extra 3D expen$e. But it's great either way!

Tarantino, and Jerry Bruckheimer for the Spike TV, ADD, intellectually-challenged, and testosterone crowd craving some violence, guts, and uber macho-macho morbidity. The original was a moral masterpiece of drama (not a single profanity in it), but this piece of garbage rates the trash can lid - to keep it in the can where it belongs.

All it is, plain and simple, is a hero-action movie that's actually pretty fun to watch if you don't take it too seriously. Think of it as a comic book in motion. Once you get the idea, everything is pretty fun. If you can't get past this concept, you need to lighten up, lol.The main gripe I have about this movie is the horrible soundtrack and music. The composer should be shot because he/she doesn't know how to score the music with the scenes. About 90 percent of the music track is cheesy hip-hop/rap that doesn't fit. It's loud, dumb, and a 10-year old music student could have done a lot better. There's no connection with what's going on in the movie and the music. If anything, the composer, if you can call him/her that, just took advantage of the opportunity to try to get his/her tunes onto the big screen.So let me rap you my opinion of the music.

1462961,"A classic plot line in American Westerns is the ""defend your land"" scenario where a small group (usually a family) needs to fight against some outsiders (be they bloodthirsty Apaches or rival ranchers or a vengeful gang of criminals) who want to muscle in. The plot has been used again and again in many genres. One recent entry is Joe Cornish's Attack the Block, a science fiction alien invasion version of the story.Set in south London, the story begins with a gang of young hoodies who mug a woman on Guy Fawkes Night (which explains the fireworks in the sky). They get interrupted by something crashing down from the sky that's not a firework. The object wrecks a car. The head hoodie, a boy named Moses, investigates the car and discovers some kind of wolf/dog monster who scratches him up. Moses and his posse hunt down the creature. After they kill it, they realize it must be some alien and they think they can cash in if they find some interested scientist or TV program. So they head to the safest spot they know, the local drug dealer's ""weed room,"" where he grows marijuana. They run into Hi-Hatz, the sadistic drug lord for the neighborhood. Hi-Hatz recruits Moses to sell for him, giving Moses a small amount of drugs. The boys have bigger problems when more alien creatures come crashing down and threaten the 'hood.The movie is standard B-movie fare--the creatures are scary but not too scary; the comedy is okay but not great; bigger issues (in this case racism) are touched on but not dealt with in depth. The story keeps viewers engaged because the characters are more like real people than like stereotypes or archetypes (though the aliens are pretty one-dimensional). Even though the gang is very unsympathetic at the beginning, they show a lot more of their humanity and vulnerability as the story goes on.The woman they mugged is an ongoing character. When she is reunited with the gang through circumstance, their interactions are real and they come to understand each other better. This plot line provides a center to the movie that keeps it from being too cliched or too formulaic or too uninteresting. The realness of the relationships raises this to the high end of the B-movie category.",Attack the Block

The writing in this 1992 series may not be quite as well done as the earlier episodes but I may just be nitpicking, because they are still funnier than most other comedies ever produced! When I say funny I mean that they allow the humor to seep into your soul gently and naturally. They are not thrown in your face or laced with vulgarity. The Yorkshire scenery is just a beautiful as ever, and the supporting characters add humor and charm to an already hilarious trio of the most ""irresponsible barmpots"" in all of England! I do have a complaint (and the reason for 4 stars not 5) about the DVD's for this whole series, and that is - there are no extras to allow the fan an inside look or to look behind the camera. A show of this quality deserves the very best marketing and the fans deserve the very best packaging! Come on BBC....don't short-change this classic treasure!Edit: I want to add something I have noticed. Some, not all, of the episodes have been edited and scenes cut short!

51907,"When I was eleven back in 1997, I got Mousehunt on VHS. It's a movie I remember watching a lot over the years. So I decided why not and bought Mousehunt on DVD.Mousehunt involves two brothers, Ernie and Lars Smultz (Nathan Lane and Lee Evans respectively) inheriting their father's string factory and an old decrepit house. After Lars is thrown out of his house by his wife and Ernie loses his reputation and restaurant after a fatal incident involving a roach, the two move in together at the old house where they ultimately discover the house they believed to be worthless is actually worth millions. Unfortunately, the house also comes with another tenant--a single mouse that seems to be much smarter than the average mouse.Much of the humor of the movie comes from the two brothers' efforts in getting rid of the mouse who just seems to survive everything and turn it back on the humans.It's really more of a slapstick kind of comedy movie. Perhaps as much as The Three Stooges might have been, but it's there.There's a few more special features on the DVD than this Amazon page lets on. Listed on the back of my DVD are ""From The Cutting Room Floor"", production notes, cast and filmmakers' bios, and the theatrical trailers (none of which I have actually watched yet since getting the DVD recently).But I should point out though the DVD I received is NOT the one used in the main image. I got the one that looks like the third image, with Nathan Lane in a chef's hat and the mouse on front so that might be the reason.It's certainly just a fun movie, if anything.

298081,"It's such a shame that films have pretty much forgotten how to tell stories as thrilling, witty, racy & wonderful as this, with tongue slightly in cheek, but never so much as to spoil the tension & excitement. Drenched in old-fashioned movie color that bursts from the screen, with larger-than-life characters just as vivid, crossing bon mots & swords at every turn, the classic Rafael Sabatini tale begins on a high note & sustains it right to the end.Stewart Granger is superb as our hero, showing just enough self-awareness to let us know he's cognizant of his situation at all times, but never going too far & winking at the audience outright. In the gorgeous flame-haired Eleanor Parker & the so-innocent-she's-sexy Janet Leigh, he has two equally matched leading ladies, strong-willed & able to get what they want -- the fiery Parker obviously so, the demure Leigh deceptively so.But an adventure story is really only as good as its villain -- and Mel Ferrer delivers a fabulous performance -- sneering sardonically, utterly bereft of morality, yet so charming & intense that you can't help admiring him a little bit despite his self-serving persona. The justly acclaimed 7-minute swordfight at the climax of the film retains its power to amaze & delight even in this age of CGI-aided stuntwork; and it's all the more impressive for simply being 2 good actors giving their all every instant.And even in the happy (if in some cases unexpected) endings for our characters, there's a bit of slapstick that leads to a great visual joke, one that ends the film on just the right note.

But two different actors played the role in the third and fourth movie.I honestly just bought it for the original movie as I loved it as a child, as I liked all the 'old' westerns (including Clint's 'Man with No Name' Trilogy and pretty much all of the 'Duke's' movies), so I wasn't expecting a lot of the follow-up movies and I was happy I wasn't expecting a lot!  Same story pretty much with a few little changes, so don't expect anything great.  The blu-ray transfer for the movies was very good, though and that made me happy and seeing the original movie again was a must for my collection.I paid right at $19 for this blu-ray and as far as I'm concerned, it was money well spent.

But if you (like I) admire the film, you may want to spare yourself the annoyance of listening to Richard Schickel trash the film throughout the DVD's commentary track. I find it bewildering that the distributors should choose a critic with such a negative attitude toward the film and its star. I realize that DVD Commentary Tracks have become an art-form in their own right: from gossipy, hyperventilating fan-tracks...to dry-as-dust recitals of obscure factoids. But whatever the approach, in order to merit the term ""Special Feature,"" they should at least provide some concrete information about the film (and how it was created) that one may not have known before. In any event, they should offer more than the opinionated maunderings of a patronizing bore.",N/A
1397315,"If you are wondering why anyone would buy a season of a reality TV show that you watched live -- and thus know the outcome -- well, I wondered that myself, too. But I remembered really enjoying ""Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains"" when it aired, and the instant video price ($19.99) was pretty inviting. The final kicker was that I was looking for something to load on my Kindle Fire so that I could watch TV while running on a treadmill.And ""Heroes vs. Villains"" has been everything I remembered -- great characters, great scenery, great twists and turns. Interestingly, while I remember the general arc (there are major arcs in the Heroes and Villains tribes before the merge, and then a third arc post-merge), it turns out that I don't actually remember that much about the order of booting. In some instances, I did recall that a player had progressed far, so when an early episode suggested that that player was at risk, I knew something would happen. Still, it has been vastly entertaining.It's also a great show for watching while running. It doesn't demand a tremendous amount of concentration, and a good deal of it is some kind of competitive athletics, so it tends to inspire my running.The picture quality on my Kindle Fire is generally good, but there's a surprising amount of unintentional pixelation (that is, not driven by CBS censors).

It is painfully clear that the writers are riding the wave of publicity this show gets and letting it sail off into syndication.What originally attracted me to this show is gone. The cutting edge company, the turmoil of the ad business, the competition, the intense character development, the business that made these ordinary people truly ""mad"", all left with season 3. The show would now be more aptly called ""The Adventures Of Don and Rodger - and who cares"". Far to little time is spent on the other cast members (with the exception of Peggy) to make the audience care about any of them. I am surprised the show is able to retain these actors season after season. Although this season seems to have brought significant turnover (Don's ad team).The audience has patiently collected bits and pieces of Don's mysterious past along the way but what he is hiding seems to be moot now and at this point I am not sure I care any more. He is still rich, hard cold, in charge and surrounded by women that have lost the ""new car"" appeal. Nothing about his character has changed.And then there is good old recession-proof Rodger.

1629614,"The decision to go funny-dark instead of serious-dark when telling this true horror story is done for one obvious reason:  These crooks are ate-UP with stupid.  Even if the pool was empty, they'd still be drowning in stupid.  And you gotta give Florida credit; NO one does crazy like Florida.Mark Wahlberg as Chief Crazy in Charge just nailed it.  If you loved Wahlberg in The Other Guys, he brings the funny here too, while still playing the positive-thinking psycho-killer.  Even rewound a couple times just to watch his face as he ripped some major snappy dialogue.  Part of what makes Wahlberg funny is his flow and patience to wait for *just* the right beat to make his move.  He doesn't tell jokes or do schtick, thank god.  He just convinces us he's completely unaware that what he's saying is hilarious.Anthony Mackie brings his own special crazy, especially at the strip-club bar when he's tripping on just how big he's gonna get in that gym:  Ima get SWOLE!  Ima have to turn SIDEways and shiat just to walk through tha door!!.  Because Dwayne Johnson played the guy who was Christian with still a tiny bit of conscience while snorting dumpsters full of coke, he had to tone down his funny from what we saw in The Other Guys, and only once do we get to see him do that blazing adorable full-faced smile of his.Of special note is Emily Rutherfurd who all-too-briefly played Ed Harris' wife.  That kind of wicked-smart and wicked-cool makes her wicked-funny.  We desperately need more nuanced female roles like this and the actresses who can handle it.  Ken Jeong as the slimy, cliched motivational speaker was the perfect choice.

441823,"Vittorio De Sica&#8217; s 1948 film Ladri di Biciclette (The Bicycle Thieves) has generated enough acclaim in its life that it&#8217;s hard to justify writing another review of it. Nonetheless, as an aspiring screenwriter, after I came across a 1950 NY Times article by Arthur Miller that praised the film for its simplicity, I though Ladri di Biciclette would be worth examining for the purposes of learning about simple filmmaking. How to make a great film based on a simple story with very few characters. Arthur Miller calls this one-track conflict of a film &#8220;to be very close to a lyrical masterpiece.&#8221;The plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one. This job requires a bicycle which the Man also fortuitously procures. During the the Man&#8217;s first day on the job his bicycle is stolen. The rest of the film focuses on his crusade to find the stolen bicycle and thereby remain employed.There is a real aesthetic beauty as the Man and his Son tramp the streets, the camera follows, and the city dominates. Rome is so influential that characters lives, their interactions, and their relationships are molded and shaped by her. As the man follows clues to track down his bicycle he transverses what seems like the whole city. Moving from one Roman neighborhood to another, new scenes mean new characters, and new characters mean new conflicts.There are many touching scenes between the Man and his Son, but one especially where we think the Son has been hurt. This scene reaffirms that the Man&#8217;s true priorities are first and foremost with his family, but within seconds the Man is pulled right back into the chaos of the hunt for the bicycle. Throughout the entire film injustice reigns, paired with the utter simplicity of the film&#8217;s production, Ladri di Biciclette is a truly remarkable achievement. An example of unadorned, simple cinema.The plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one.

1565278,"""The deeper you bond, the better you fight,"" Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) tells two co-warriors. Syncing emotion with action with more action, Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is a warmer Transformers -or Real Steel writ extra-large, complete with dad issues and hardware that's a bit lumbering but gets the job done. Something that could be said of the movie itself.It shares a key niggle with Michael Bay's metal-on-metal orgies: some of the scraps, you just don't have the foggiest what you're looking at. Otherwise, though, we're dealing with a different model of FX-engorged blockbusting. One that's steeped in affection and sincerity and doesn't go in for jarringly crass stereotypes, slapstick or sex gags.The pre-title sequence nails a balance between exposition, character development and mass destruction, as Charlie Hunnam's Raleigh Becket voiceovers the state of the play (invading aliens from an under-sea portal are combated by robots steered by two pilots sharing a mind-link called `The Drift'), before tragedy hits and he's out of the game... Until, of course, soldier-boss Pentecost pulls him back in.After the opening rumble, it's a good hour before the Kaiju (them) and the Jaegars (us) have a rematch. No problem: GdT uses the downtime to get our heads around Drift-ing, which boils down to a not-too-mawkish metaphor for human connection.Strutting and soulful, Hunnam is the hero, but the film's heart belongs to Babel Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi, who overcomes plucky-rookie-battling-inner-demons clich&eacute;s with unstudied sweetness. Plus a few cool moves in the training dojo.Elba is suitably commanding (and gets a corny-but-rousing Independence Day moment), Ron Perlman shark-grins through an extended cameo and there are two highly-strung scientists (Charlie Day, Burn Gorman) you think are going to annoy but grow to tolerate.And this being GdT, the creatures are beautifully ugly creations: machete-faced, blue-acid-barfing, multi-tail-lashing... infused with less of Pan's Labyrinth's poetry perhaps, though there's a Harryhausen-like pulp majesty to their stately wrestles with the Jaegars.You just wish, goggling as they thrash across cities, seas, space and beyond, that your view wasn't so clogged with embers, sparks, mist, neon and rain, rain, rain.Still, such is the goodwill GdT marshals elsewhere -the little sight gags, the generosity towards all characters, good or douche-y, the sheer childlike delight in building a massive made-up world - you don't really mind not knowing which robot the severed arm that just flew across the screen belongs to.",N/A

My general impression, though, is that some (perhaps significant) sequences are missing (or were cut for whatever reason in the editing room), and as a result there is a general feeling of dangling scenario avenues, of incoherence - it never becomes really frightening. This is particularly true for the ending: abrupt, lacking continuity and somewhat unsatisfying.

It's about friendship, loyalty, respect, the abolition of greed and judgment, and about the importance of family, life, and love.

My son and I finally saw the movie this weekend in the theatre.""World War Z"" (2013 release; 116 min.) starts off with Gerry Lane (played by Brad Pitt) and his family (wife and 2 young daughters) having breakfast while keeping an eye on the TV, broadcasting disturbing news about rabies-reminding symptoms breaking out everywhere. Next thing we know, the Lane family is stuck in a traffic jam in downtown Phillie, and all mayhem breaks loose. Those 10-15 min. in downtown Phillie are some of the most intense minutes I can recall seeing in a movie in a long, long time, and after that we are off to the races. To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience and hence pointless.Several comments: the initial 80 min. of the movie (ending with the crash in Wales) are nothing short of flawless, indeed the most thrilling and intense movie viewing that I have experienced in a long time. The uncertainty, anxiety and utter chaos all feel very real. Forget that this is a ""zombie"" movie, as it is more about a movie where the human race is fighting for its very survival. The last 40 min. are not quite as stellar (and hence I can't rate this movie 5 stars), where the producers seemingly were struggling in how to bring it all home and wrap it up in a sensible and believable manner. At that, they succeed, but the visuals simply cannot compete with those of earlier action scenes in the movie. All that aside, I would strongly urge you to forget about all of the negative stuff you've been hearing or reading about this movie, as ""World War Z"" is shockingly good and makes for a very intense movie experience. Both my son and I simply loved it. We saw the movie in 3D and I didn't think it added much to the experience, so save those extra $3 or 4 bucks and see it in 2D. Meanwhile, ""World War Z"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",World War Z

26755,"'Joan of Arc' is stylistically a key work in the history of cinema, through its combination of close-ups, camera angles, framing and movements of the characters and of the camera on this characters.Dreyer created a masterful visual sequencing with the movements of the heads inside the screen and of camera panning and tilting on these same heads (of the judges of Joan of Arc). This sequencing suggests an inescapable iron encircling of Joan of Arc (whose close-ups were filmed with a fixed camera) by her vicious judges. All these shots created the same effect as that of the painting 'Christ Carrying the Cross' by Jheronimus Bosch, where the serene face of Christ contrasts sharply with the ferocity of the visages in the crowd around him.The camera angles and the decentered and canted framing further accentuate the contrast between Jeanne's face full of grace and the grim facial expressions of her corrupt judges, a bunch of perfidious theologians and dishonest lawyers.The film exposes blatantly the corruption of the Catholic Church, which slavishly defends the English crown and its interests. Instead of trying to stay above the political fray, it prefers to play an active role in a war of succession thereby choosing the interests of the foreign forces instead of those of the native population.The character of Joan of Arc is interpreted sublimely by Maria (Ren&eacute;e Jeanne) Falconetti.Ongoing rumors of Carl Th. Dreyer's misogyny and sadism towards his actresses are contradicted by the testimony of the daughter of M. Falconetti in Torben Skjdt Jensen's documentary 'Carl Th. Dreyer: Min metier'. However, Carl Th. Dreyer put without a shadow of a doubt the quality of his shots and of the final product (his movie) above the fate of his actors and actresses (see the testimony of Preben Lerdorff Rye in the same documentary).With 'Joan of Arc' Carl Th. Dreyer shot an eternal masterpiece. A must see.",N/A

856309,"Voyager, the third spin-off of the highly successful original Star Trek series from the late 1960&#8217;s, holds its own with the previous spin-offs, Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.  Due to its plotline, being lost in the Delta quadrant, it was able to venture into material the other series couldn&#8217;t.  While they still used a lost Klingon or Ferengi, not to mention &#8220;Q&#8221;, they moved on to new cultures, creatures, and scientific advances.That said, I found the writing to be superb insofar as plotlines, and character development.  One sore point was Capt. Janeway.  There&#8217;s no way in all of creation a ship&#8217;s captain makes so many bad decisions and comes out without a scratch.  The command decisions she made during the last year of the series were at best head scratching.  While I find the writing to be inventive and resourceful insofar as the new ideas presented, the ultra liberal bent of character Janeway, clearly shows why a liberal government or in this case a ship&#8217;s captain, is destructive to society as a whole.  I say this not to reflect on the actress Kate Mulgrew, she only played the part written for her.  Then again, it is a syfi/fantasy show so anything goes.The acting becomes automatic, as in any TV show where the actor plays the part for any length of time.  There were standout parts, as in Robert Picardo as the holographic doctor, who was also a standout actor in the Stargate spin-off SG1.  I can&#8217;t say enough good things about his acting.  Thanks to the writers for giving him a lot of air time.  Roxanne Dawson was superb as B'Elanna Torres, and Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine) how did she keep such a stiff attitude for so many shows.  I think she was one of everyone&#8217;s favorites.All in all a series worth watching, certainly as good as Next Generation, but maybe a bit shy of matching Deep Space Nine, but an excellent choice once you except the ultra liberal slant of the Janeway character.  You do grow to accept her as the captain; only one you wouldn&#8217;t want to serve under.  In real life she would have killed her entire crew the first year.  She did manage to get them lost in the Delta quadrant.",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Season

1656632,"Obviously this is a film that rubs a LOT of people the wrong way, but for reasons I'm still trying to figure out it's absolute catnip to me. The first time I saw a still of Johnny Depp in his Tonto makeup with the stuffed crow on his head I said to myself, I've gotta see this. Then, after seeing it in the theater, I thought it was so extremely fantastic in every way that I had to go back a couple of days later to make sure it really was as good as I'd remembered.I like the way this film takes time-honored cliches of the Western film and uses them as a solid framework for a very unique, creative and eclectic take on the Western. You've got so much going on here, with the parable of the corporate raider versus the unlikely alliance of the left-wing lawyer turned outlaw and the rogue Native American libertarian (I'm thinking Mitt Romney versus Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul.) But most enchanting to me is Johnny Depp's tragicomic Tonto, who I think is his finest character to date. Clearly he's an homage to Buster Keaton with his stone face and supernatural ability to survive very dangerous bouts of physical comedy, but also as another reviewer has mentioned a take on the Native American sacred clown, whose eccentric viewpoint helps him and those around him to survive.",The Lone Ranger

742067,"A woman moves into a isolated countryside convent that is made of stone and has nuns dressed like mummies. At the convent upstairs, she meets Alucarda. Soon they wander the surrounding rural landscape and meet a satanic gypsie who appears to be harmless. Exploring the countryside further, they enter a stone burial site and open a casket. This unleashes an evil spirit that is apparently the cause for some or all of the satanic and demonic instances that follow.This pictures film style may or may not be appealing. I thought a lot of the dialogue and acting resemble something like a stage play from the middle ages rather than a film; when I watch it, I feel like I'm sometimes watching an old fashioned play instead of watching a movie. The music and many sequences in the film may seem old fashioned and dated to some people, but these parts make the film unique to an extent. The exploitation content in the film is high with plentiful full nudity which includes some full male nude scenes, and the violence and gore is quite impactful at times. It doesn't have gore from beginning to end, but some scenes are worth mentioning. There's one scene during the climax when a girl emerges from a blood filled coffin to attack a nun like an animal by clawing and biting her on the neck. This scene stands out, as well as another scene where a possessed nun has her head hacked off by a cruel fanatical priest who had managed an exorcism where a fully nude women is pierced with needles. The movie is very explicit with a brisk pace, and there isn't really anything that I would consider to be filler in between the nudity and violence. The scenery and atmosphere is good as well, but the problem is that the movie may seem dated to some people because it doesn't have a modern film style.The full screen DVD looks very good. I've had this DVD for awhile and I still watch it. The replay value is very good, as long as you're a big fan of 70s exploitation flicks.",Alucarda

24268,"Firstly let me say, that anything that helped rally the British people to fight and win a war against the Satanic Nazi Germany is on the side of the angels. Filmed and released in 1937 when Britain was divided into two camps, one led by the redoubtable Winston Churchill saw that Nazi Germany was threat to civilization itself and would have none of the poisonous overtures of 'friendship' Hitler was making towards Britain.The other led by Chamberlain aimed to appease and ingratiate itself with the Nazi evil.The writers of this quite splendid movie must have known that was would happen. The very title of this film 'Fire over England' seems prophetic as three years later Nazi planes would literally spread fire , death and suffering across Britain.Words to the effect of fire and torment over England are spoken in the movie.The movie urged the English people to choose the light of goodness and freedom and fight against tyranny and diabolical moral darkness. As England had chosen in 1688 and the splendid victory she had won over the Spanish Armada.Russia was ralled in a similar way before the War by a brilliant epic period piece calledAlexander NevskyThe film features England in 1588 in the run-up to the Spanish Armada's attack on the England. Elizabeth and her advisers Lord Burleigh (played by Morton Selten who adds some gravitas and dignity), and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Leslie Banks). The dashing and swash-buckling young hero Michael Ingolby (Laurence Olivier) is injured when his father's ship is captured by the Spanish and he washes ashore and is nursed back to health by his Spanish captors who he denounces (after a brief romance with his captives daughter, the Spanish signorita Elena (Tamara Desni) before taking a fishing boast back to England where he is reunited with his lady love Cynthia (Vivien Leigh) urges Queen Elizabeth to raise an army and navy to fight Spain. What was a little dampening for me was the sometimes childish behaviour of Olivia and Leighs characters.The ultimate star of the show is Flora Robson who played Elizabeth I with great majesty, flair and splendid wit.She really gave the succeeding generations of actresses who would play Queen Elizabeth in film, a hard task to follow.Michael Ingolby is then sent back into Spain as an agent where he successfully susses out Spain's plans and engages in some sabotageOf course the finest hour of the film is the battle where the Armada is itself destroyed.

I was concerned that he was going mainstream and lost his edge like the Pang Bros. and M. Night Shyamalan have. Being a graduate of Psychology and Social Sciences, I was enthralled by this film. The film is loaded with psychological aspects and is one big case study of a tortured protagonist. You would think that someone walking around in a rabbit suit would be a ridiculous and rubbish but this is not the case with this film. The film is very haunting and disturbing at times.

616403,"&#8220;Seabiscuit&#8221; was my absolute favorite film of that year&#8230;the progression that you see from the prosperous 1920s into the Depression-era was beautifully done from the production design to the costumes to just the feel of the film. And the story was so inspirational and moving with Maguire, Bridges, and Cooper at the top of their game! Kudos also for the camerawork, editing, and direction of Gary Ross. My favorite quote came at the end and left me teary-eyed: &#8220;Y&#8217; know, everyone thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him&#8230;but he fixed us, and in a way we fixed each other.&#8221; I don&#8217;t say this about many films, but this was an absolutely lovely film! and so much better than the interminable LOTR3 that won.

1364141,"I'll admit that when I first heard of a remake in the Nikita series I was a little worried.  But once I watched the first episode I was hooked from beginning to end.  This has everything that we want in a spy tv series.  It is action-packed, sexy, awesome, and just filled with tons of excitement.First off, the characters are amazing!  Maggie Q does a great job as non other than &#34;Nikita&#34; herself.  I just love this character.  She is beautiful and sexy (in her own way) and also deadly.  I wouldn't want to get on her bad side.  We also have Michael, who I swear has a great voice.  This guy just has authority when he speaks, no one can ignore him.  And he also has extreme ways of being a spy.  But he does have a soft side, if you have the means of getting to it.  Next we have Alex.  Trust me when I say it, this girl is not who she seems to be.  There are a lot of twists and turns with her.  She is very convincing and very smart.  This one is definitely not to be trifled with.  And then we have the villains of this story.  Percy is, by far, a great villain.  He is threatening in all sorts of ways.  When he gives a threat, he &#34;really&#34; means it.  Heck, we even see him snap a guy's neck (spoilers).  You can tell that this guy is angry, even when he is smiling or not.  Last, we have Amanda.  Okay, I do have some problems with this villain, but in the end she is still a great villain, I just think Percy is better.  She is very deadly in her torturing methods (again spoilers) and can even put a chill down your spine.  You can tell that a dark history lies deep in her past, which makes her even more interesting.  What can I say, these characters are amazingly done.The storyline of this season is completely done with fast-pacing, right acting, great action, awesome twists and turns, great excitement, and also lots of amazing moments that really leave you wanting more.  I've always loved the idea of a secret organization that moves in the shadows and uses the government to their advantage.  It's like the ultimate storyline that can be used.  Jason Bourne came close, but it was missing the whole secret organization type of thing.  Division is that type of storyline that we are looking for and it fits the bill.  And I just love the idea of a highly trained assassin trying to take it down.  That is where Nikita comes in.  I love how the secrecy just plays such an amazing role in this season, allowing us to feel the excitement and the heart-pounding question of &#34;what will happen next?&#34;.  The action is done very well and the pacing is just right.I understand that some people don't like how this new series is done, compared to the old one.  But if you really think about it, there is nothing this series can do what the original series has already done.  It can't beat the old series or ruin it, because it has already a great series and nothing can change that, not even this series.  Besides, this is a new take on the legend of &#34;Nikita&#34; and it fits really well.  We need to come up with new ideas to do a new version, not redo it.  If you love the old series, that's great.  If you love this series, awesome.  There is nothing bad about it.I say that this series is worth a good look at.  Buy it!",Nikita: Season 1

1583550,"The CSI saga continues...................not missing a beat without the major past cast members.  Says a lot about the writing of this show and the quality of the acting talent they continue to get.  ""Bad Girl"" Jules is a great diversion from the prim and proper Katherine now departed, and Ted Danson continues to impress as DB Russell.  Now....what would be great is some return visits from Katherine (as an FBI agent) and Grissom, maybe for a two-parter?  Katherine clashing with Jules would let the sparks fly big time.  It would also give the writers a chance to profile Grissom and Sara's explosive relationship a little further.  And, have another great actor (say, ""Fringe"" Alumi Anna Torv?) do a guest shot as another female serial killer? That would be great stuff! The best episodes in CSI's now 14 year run have always been where the principal characters come up against villans who are every bit the equal of the principals in intelligance, and are more than capable of defeating them! (the minature killer, the suicide killer ""Paul Milander"" from Seasons 1 & 2, etc.  the list goes on. Maybe even another fine ""Fringe"" alumnus like John Noble to do a guest appearance as another ""mad scientist"" who could clash with DB?

462636,"This movie is pretty amazing, considering it was made for TV.  The effects are first rate and its scenery and details are quite true to the artwork of the original stories, which you can plainly see if you access the bonus features.  Some reviewers on Amazon have complained that the stories are taken from both the Alice books, but I don't think I've ever seen a movie for Alice that HASN'T had stories mixed together.  The little vignettes in this movie are no different from a dozen other Alice movies.  They're familiar and have become the most loved parts and pieces of those wonderful books.  In particular, I find the Duchess and the Tweedledum/Tweedledee segments very funny and odd.

WAY over the top!When anything is possible, (as it is with CGI) there is no wow factor left -- That leaves only acting and writing to depend on, which leaves this film needing work -- perhaps a complete re-write and re-filming by a better team?If nothing else, 'Man of Steel' is a huge improvement over the &#34;boy of fluff&#34;  that 'Superman Returns' gave us in 2006 -- But, this one  lacks the warmth, heart, soul and  humor of earlier portrayals.

634892,"Who better to play a competent Texas Ranger...why, Tommy Lee Jones.  And the role fits Mr. Jones like an old, beloved, reliable shirt.  And that lends a sense of credibility to this film's rather far-fetched plot of the Texas Rangers needing to protect five university cheerleaders who witnessed a murder...I think that only works out in certain fantasies.  Anyway, this film balances Mr. Jones' gruff demeaner (does he trademark that or something) with it's light-hearted humor and out-there antics.  While this work isn't deep or thought-provoking in any way, it is certainly hilarious and entertaining.  Also, the film's score is quite catchy and I've been unable to find a soundtrack recording out there (I'm not sure there is one, but I can dream...)  I will say that having the real-life Governor of Texas appearing in the film as himself does not make this plot any more credible.  In fact, the Governor relaying the protection assignment actually lowers the credibility for me no matter how connected the cheerleaders' fathers seem to be.  I will reccomend this to anyone looking for some light-hearted, funny entertainment with some action and a good score and a great leading man.  Enjoy.P.S.:  A special shoutout to the University of Texas at Austin, who for the first time allowed any sort of filming to be done on their campus and allowed their name and related associations and traditions to be used.  That did lend the film some serious credibility.  Thank you, Longhorns!",Man of the House

At times, it was hard to see what Kathy and Cindy were doing. Nonetheless, by the time I got to Part C, I was drenched in sweat. Overall, I rate this workout highly, because if you do all 3 parts back-to-back, you get an extremely tough, but doable, workout.Notes: - Other than a quick water break, we took no breaks. I believe this is why I got so much out of the workout.- I used 3 pound weights whenever weights were used, and 4 pound weights when Kathy asked for 2 weights in one hand.

In all, the duo danced, sang and romanced in 10 movies together, but Top Hat and Swing Time are by far the best. The plot here is an Astaire-Rogers staple: mistaken identity. It keeps them bouncing back and forth for pretty much the whole movie, and it's amusing enough to fill the spaces between the song-and-dance numbers well. But the numbers are magical! Their ""Isn't It a Lovely Day..."" gets them off to a flying start. The title song, featuring Astaire versus a cadre of tuxedo-clad dancers, is spectacularly timed. And ""Cheek to Cheek,"" with Rogers in a dress made from ostrich features, is divine. Even ""The Picolino,"" a vast set piece at the end, is delightful.

19161,"The 1950s present a very unique crossroads in the American perception of youth. The whole conception of teen-agers and adolescents as their own distinctive demographic was still fairly fresh (a product of the post-World War II era), a tension highlighted by the shifting culture of film and art during that time. The classical era of Hollywood was starting to fade away and grittier, arguably more realistic film was moving in.It is hard to imagine films like Picnic and Rebel Without a Cause being about the same species, let alone the same demographic and being released in the very same year. Rebel kicked off the new wave of adolescence in film as a tortured, disturbed perspective on American life, while Picnic was with the older school of thought, of classical beauty and imagery.While more romantic (and hopelessly idealistic), Picnic is just that: an absolutely beautiful movie. Much like East of Eden (another small-town, youth epic from 1955), Picnic is the story of a young hero trying to win over the girl and the approval of his fellow countrymen. Like most classical teen films, there is plenty of melodrama, but the film is shot in an almost transcendental manner. We are given sweeping shots of the young couple, silhouetted against the Kansas City twilight sky. They could be anybody, anywhere, at any time.Picnic seems less concerned with the action of its primary characters than it is to raise fundamental questions. (Honestly, not that much happens in this movie.) Instead, it provokes questions of fate, how much control we have in our own lives, and lost opportunities. In one of the more tragic storylines, one couple puts off pursuing marriage for years and years, only to eventually follow through but for the wrong reasons. At what point do our dreams become facades? How much can (or should) we change for the people we love?For any classical Hollywood film (let alone a youth-oriented one), these are very heavy questions to ask. Particularly in the post-war era, this film reflects the growing cynicism and sense of regret that became later associated with counterculture and other reactive youth culture (like Rebel).In addition to a solid story, the film also gives us a wonderful ensemble cast, led by the miscast (but still fantastic, as always) William Holden and the stunning Kim Novak in a spellbinding love story. This is a very important, and often forgotten, epic youth film ripe with nostalgia and passion.",N/A

The picture quality and sound really enhanced the experience of the story and the experience of life on the streets of New York. For those of you who are not familiar with the story, Serpico is a young and idealistic New York police officer in the bad old days of rampant corruption. Trained and assigned to work undercover (plain clothes) he discovers as much crime within his ranks as on the streets. He attempts to bring the corruption to the attention of his superiors and is met with hostility and denial. In the end, he is put in harms way by his own fellow officers and is shot for his trouble. I'll not give away the entire ending ... but leave it to say that he recovers, else we would not have this riviting story. The story is in the grand tradition of French Connection but much better (at least I think so). The performance delivered by Al Pacino is, of course, superb.",Serpico VHS

1500770,"It is important for the viewers of this movie to realize that the story is historical fiction. Many events in the movie were fabricated to dramatize the story. It is okay to do so in a movie if they work, but they don't in this one. For dramatic effects, the scriptwriter follows an old and tired Hollywood formula: imminent danger of exposure, last minute cancellation of the plan, car chase of the plane on the tarmac, etc. I have seen too many movies with that storyline. As a result, the movie is terribly boring. The true story is much more interesting. If all the fabricated dramas were cut out leaving only the true story behind, the movie would have been a lot more authentic and believable. The leading man and director Ben Affleck wears the same expressionless face throughout the movie. He could have done better.Argo won the Oscar for best picture and the scriptwriter Chris Terrio best writing. The decision reeks of Oscar politics.  Critics assert that this happened because the story glorifies Hollywood; the true heroes were the Canadian, and to a lesser extend the New Zealand and the British diplomats, who risked their personal safety to come to the aid of the Americans.

522948,"Released in 2000, ""Me, Myself & Irene"" is a Jim Carrey comedy about a Rhode Island motorcycle cop (Carrey) who has a mental breakdown after allowing people to walk all over him for three decades. He develops a split personality consisting of Charlie, the nice guy, and Hank, the take-no-crap dude. After going on meds, he's given the assignment of escorting Irene (Renee Zellwegger) from Rhode Island to upstate New York. The two become fugitives as Charlie/Hank falls for Irene. Meanwhile Charlie's three black sons get involved in finding him.The film works because Carrey gives the schizophrenic role all his heart and the Farrelly brothers (the directors/writers) go to extremes with the gags, as usual. There's quite a bit of crudeness and cussing, but I was able to overlook it and laugh. Most of the cussing comes from Charlie's three black sons who are veritable geniuses, but maintain their homey lingo. It's not meant to be offensive, but funny; you either get it or you don't.The film also works because we can all relate to the struggle within between wanting to get along with people and not wanting to be taken advantage of. It's somehow enjoyable to see Charlie morph into Hank with his take-no-sheet attitude. I also like the way the film ties up the schizophrenia issue. The answer is to maintain a balance between being overly nicey-wicey and overly forthright & intolerable. The ""middle road"" is the key.This was the first film I saw Renee in and she really shines here -- petite, sassy, smart and beautiful. I also like the funny three black sons and the addition of the dubious albino dude.FINAL WORD: ""Me, Myself and Irene"" loses points for being unnecessarily crude, but -- if you can overlook that or laugh with it -- it is entertaining and funny. It places well with Carrey's funniest movies, although the first Ace Ventura film, ""The Mask"" and ""Liar, Liar"" are better.The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in Rhode Island and Vermont.GRADE: B+",N/A

1481168,"I really enjoyed GI Joe Rise of Cobra. It was not perfect but it was a good movie. In an age where cinema gives the audience reboots, sequels, prequels, and adaptations, here are my thoughts on GI Joe Retaliation.Returning to the movie: Channing Tatum as Duke, Ray Park as Snake Eyes, Byung-hun Lee as Storm Shadow(good performance), Jonathan Pryce as the President, and taking the role as primary villain this time around; Arnold Vosloo as Zartan. New additions include: Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, RZA as Blind Master, D J Cotrona as Flint, Bruce Willis as Joseph Colton, and the beautiful Adrienne Palicki as Lady Jaye(yes she IS hot). The acting was not the best all the way through, but I do not always expect ""the greatest acting ever"" with a movie like this.The story line is actually quite fun, and there will be some surprises thrown your way while watching this movie. Occasionally, there are times when the script goes all over the place and it does have a few cheesy one liners, but it does have its undeniably funny moments including (spoiler) watching Channing Tatum play video games. The story may not be the best, but Retaliation does deliver the goods in terms of action, sound, and its core plan as a movie.As stated in my headline, I feel Retaliation is not entirely better than its predecessor, but it is a good feeling when despite the flaws, and major/minor differences, you still find yourself enjoying a movie for what it is. GI Joe Retaliation is likable as a sequel, and while i do feel improvements can/should be made, I see no problem with a 3rd movie being made. As a matter of fact, I welcome it.7.4/10",N/A

Downton Abbey has taken their TV productions to new heights in a way that Julian Fellows probably never thought possible, but at the same time a sense of detachment and disappointment has settled in after this season.  l hate to be spiteful but it's slowly evolving into an extremely well produced soap opera.  With the various characters coming and going you get the sense they're trying to keep the storyline alive but too many improbable events add up to hard-to-believe episodes.  This entire series has been the best of the best and I consider it to be the crowning achievement of Brit TV. Some of us, a lot of us, here in America have a serious appetite for this formal English society with all its maneuvering and back biting - regardless of our social emphasis on the everyman here.

The very 1st movie I watch was ""Crank"". I REALLY liked that movie. Laughed my fanny off. Since then... As I stated before, same character, different name. But if you LOVE action movies with unbelievable fights & scrapes, by all means go for it. It seems to me that once an actor gets pegged as one type, They never stand a chance to act as something else. That's sad because I do believe he has more to offer than another ""Hulk"" only doesn't turn green.

529319,"It's really  not necessary to follow the confused and confusing plot. Action is the key to the entertainment value and there is plenty of that, mostly well done. All you need know is that Snipes is a good guy no matter how things look and so is Maury Chaykin,  playing a subordinate role with real style. The young woman interpreter with glasses is a good guy too, but everyone else is suspect: some of these others are good guys, some are bad guys and some turn out to be simply background for the action. While occasionally both those playing good and those playing bad guys are a bit too over-stereotyped in their performances, on the whole, the cast handle themselves with a fair degree of constraint, when not shooting, bombing and committing mayhem in the interest of their various causes. Key to the success of the film, of course, omitting the director, whose work is not easily segregated from what the cast is doing in character, Snipes is the key to the success of the movie. He makes the action far from boring and does well in other  aspects of the role as required.In all, a no-brainer with a sufficiently interesting plot and set of characters, to create an adequate backdrop to vigorous action.

Disc one starts with A Trip Through The Walt Disney Studios which is an interesting piece that was never meant to be seen by the public is a look at the production of Snow White and studio workings. It's pretty straightforward, but a nice piece to have in this collection. The next feature How Disney Cartoons Are Made is a recycling of the same footage, but much more extended. While you will feel this is a little redundant, it is interesting to see the reused footage when planned for an audience. The main feature on disc one of The Reluctant Dragon a film that also uses some of the footage in both features, but it an enjoyable film with some excellent animated sequences. The bonus material on the disc one is made up of a Studio Tour hosted by Leonard Maltin showing the studio complex, behind the boards of Baby Weems, and two stills galleries one for The Reluctant Dragon and the other about the studio.Disc two's main content is made up of three Disneyland TV shows. Story Of Animated Drawing, The Plausible Impossible and The Tricks On The Trade. All three programs are interesting to Disney fans and animation fans for sure, but having seen some of the footage on the first disc a couple of times, some of this stuff feels like a rehash.

I do not have a 3D set or a surround sound system, so I cannot comment on those.The picture quality on the Blu-ray is superb. No artifacts, color banding, off color skin tones or other problems that come from compression or a bad transfer. It looks like you're looking through a crystal clear glass window straight into the world of the movie. The clarity is amazing. If you're a gamer with a large TV, you'll get a lot of joy out of pausing the playback to pick out cameos and references in the backgrounds that you missed in the theater.The sound is likewise excellent. The dialog is clear as a bell, with no muddiness in the sound effects or musical score. This is a real bonus, since many of the video game references are auditory. For example, the sound effect when Sargent Calhoun charges her gun is taken from Mega Man X.Love the movie itself, but extras is where this release falls flat. There's five deleted scenes (with an optional commentary track), four promotional commercials made for Litwak's Arcade, a &#34;making of&#34; documentary that runs about 20 minutes, and the Paperman short shown before the film. There is a trivia feature that pops up on screen when you pause the movie, but it loops after around 10 minutes. Watching everything would take you about an hour, and that's if you watched the deleted scenes twice for the commentary track. I was expecting a lot more.Where are the cast interviews? The character galleries? I want to know what kind of legal wrangling they had to go through to get all those cameos. There isn't even a commentary track. Disney couldn't even get some of the staff or cast members to sit down and talk about the movie for an hour and a half?The lack of concept art is particularly annoying, because they show brief flashes of some it during the featurette and it looks really interesting! Then there's the music, which they don't talk about AT ALL. Come on Disney, you got Buckner and Garcia to record a new song for the credits, and it's not even mentioned.Maybe they'll be pushing an &#34;Ultimate Edition&#34; with all of the stuff that should have been on this release a few years from now.5 stars for the movie.2 stars for the extras.",Wreck It Ralph
1616397,"(Spoilers)  The filmmakers on this had a great story that they somehow screwed up.  The book ""Making Of Psycho"" is the backbone of this film.  Somehow the producers decided however in order to secure a name actress to play Mrs Hitchcock they expanded her role in this film to include a 2nd story about her and a relationship with a screen writer.  They also changed many other things around and changed some facts. This did not need to be done in order to tell a compelling story.I know this is not a documentary but ""Hitchcock"" could of stayed the course of the book (on which this film is based on).  What should  of been done (Spoilers) was how Alfred Hitchcock himself stood in the shadow of this film for the rest of his career. Also Studio politics could of been told. This film could of focused on how movie going habits were changing at the time ""Psycho"" was released.

1116067,"Joshua is a fantastic movie... for the final 30 minutes.  The first half is total nonstop disappointment involving such a ridiculously slow-moving pace that the film is almost a chore to watch.However the movie does a fantastic job making viewers wonder who really *is* the bad person- the mother who doesn't care about/flat out ignores her older son Joshua after the birth of her baby daughter, dislikes and disapproves when the grandmother comes over and tries to change the family's religious beliefs therefore making Joshua change his outlook on life, and just doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on that all important thing called motherhood.  An unfit/uncaring mother basically.Or is Joshua (the son) the bad person?  He's the one who seems really cold-hearted and unaware of his actions.  He seems willing to learn just as frequently as he does disagreeing and going against his parents wishes whenever he can despite how much the mother and father try to stop it from happening.The movie does a pretty good job during the second half making us wonder if Joshua really is responsible for the horrible things that seem to happen whenever he's around therefore leading us to conclude that the boy has mental issues, however the first hour and 10 minutes is so flat out *boring* with hardly any suspense or excitement whatsoever that the movie honestly can't be saved.  What happens during the first half you're probably wondering?  The boy learns piano, tries to adapt to a world with a new sibling, and goes out to museums with his grandmother learning about religion (actually, more like teaching his grandmother about religion).  Nothing really enticing occurs during this lengthy period of time so it feels like useless storytelling.I think what bothers me the most is the mother.  She does absolutely nothing to convince me she's mature or responsible enough to handle taking care of a child, let alone a children and a baby.  The father... well, it's best not to spoil his involvement with Joshua.  It's surprising to say the least.  I'm referring to the final 10 minutes.  Did NOT see that one coming.Overall, a slow first half doesn't really warrant a viewing in this case I'm afraid.  30 minutes of excitement and 70 minutes of boredom isn't a good ratio at all.",Joshua

1643583,"One thing about Zombie's films that comes across clearly is his love of the genre. Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in Lords. If you are a long time horror fan, especially going back to the Eurocult films of the 70s (especially the Italians) then you will appreciate it for what it was meant to be. It seems it confused the hell out of some people, which is to be expected if you have no clue about films like ""The Other Hell"" by Bruno Mattei, ""All the Colors of the Dark"" by Sergio Martino, ""Black Magic Rites"" by Renato Polselli, Moctezuma's ""The Mansion of Madness"", De Martino's ""The Antichrist"", various by the better known Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento, or Mario Bava's surreal ""Shock"" or ""Lisa and the Devil"", as well as the other entries in the ""Beyond the Door"" series, just to name a few. It helps to have seen Jean Rollin's work, as well as Jess Franco, and Paul Naschy, to be able to fully appreciate the genius of the Lords. And of course, I cannot forget Ken Russell (especially The Devils, Lair of the White Worm, and Gothic), who Rob Zombie explicitly named as an influence for this film. In other words, if you're exposure to horror is only what's come out- or remade- in the last 20 years or so, then I can see why you might be confused. This is a horror film lover's film, a demon child born of the spirit of its ancestors. Its definitely retro. Vintage Satan.There's so much going on in this film that I can't wait for it to be released on Blu Ray. My senses were overwhelmed, with so much to process on the visual and sonic levels. I loved every bit of it, by the way. Its not every day you get treated to so much bizarre, demonically inspired imagery and sound,  grotesque surrealism and hallucinatory sequences. And hardly ever in the last 20 years! In terms of acting, ""Margaret Morgan"" stole the show for me. Most of the time, Heidi was onscreen, which was fine, but man, when the original witches, especially Morgan came on, I was riveted, enthralled. The later day witches were also great, once they were revealed for who they were. Overall, the acting was just fine across the board.Thanks Rob Zombie. Lords is one of my favorite contemporary films. I will view it many times over. I can't wait to crack open the book.UPDATE: Having received the Blu Ray, I was very disappointed to find that the film is not complete. The DVD/Blu Ray release condenses the story to exclusively follow Heidi's experience. Gone are the scenes dealing with the relationship dynamics between the H Team. Gone are the scenes of how the local women respond to the subsequent playing of the title track, gone are some scenes between the author and his wife, as well as some extra footage of the death metal band. The scenes of Heidi in the room when the Jesus Saves sign was cut down, subsequent time in room 5 also cut, and her time in the baroque hall was also cut. I don't know why. Ken Foree appears in like 2 scenes in this release. I swear he actually had a role and not a cameo. I'm not sure how people who did not see the movie in theatres will experience this but I was disappointed. I am sure most who did see it in theatres will feel cheated. Why did this happen, especially to a movie that had a limited theatrical run? That means most people will not have seen the movie as it was intended to be seen.",N/A

1544547,"From top to bottom, The Master is one of the finest films of the past decade.  What Paul Thomas Anderson pulls off here is nothing short of miraculous, and with a stunning performance from Joaquin Phoenix, there are no moments throughout its 143 minute running time that won't leave you fascinated.  With a fantastic score from Johnny Greenwood, Anderson has proven without a doubt that he is our modern day Kubrick.Comparing Anderson to Kubrick is irresponsible in many ways considering the differences in their styles.  The one most significant thread joining the two, though, is their uncanny knack for telling a story.  When an Anderson or Kubrick movie comes on the screen, there is no way you're turning it off.  Kubrick pulled off this magic by his eye for detail and visual sense, while Anderson truly has a gift of casting the perfect cast to unfold his tales.  Phoenix runs the show here, and wow, does he ever.  Phoenix's talent is no secret to anyone, but even I was surprised at the level of emotion and depth he was able to conjure in The Master.  He deserved an Oscar for this performance, pure and simple.  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are fine, but when Phoenix is on the screen, it's captivating to say the absolute least.Like with all Anderson films, there is no resolution, no happy and pat ending, and no major questions have been answered.  The director is proving to be the master of character study, and his sensitive eye and gift for story telling will leave moments of humor, shock, and melancholy with the viewer that won't leave for days.Greenwood's scores complement Anderson's vision perfectly, and give the films a sense of obtuse beauty that can't be explained.  The two create landscapes and soundscapes that defy definition in the realm of film.The closing shot of The Master is one of the most beautiful and disturbing conjurations I've ever seen in a movie, and I thought about it for days after I first saw it.

1489493,"The entire movie is mostly Brad Pitt running around trying to find a solution to the Zombie virus outbreak. The problem is that it's not executed very well. Each person he meets babbles about something random and then goes on to tell him that ""the princess is in another castle"". So finally he sets out to the next location to find the origin of the virus so he can stop it. Along the way in his search he realizes something about the attacking zombie herds that leads him to have a stroke of genius that will help him find a way to save humanity.This movie is mostly CGI zombies and the other usual Hollywood special effects. I don't know what it was exactly about this movie but nothing worked for me. Brad Pitt isn't exactly someone I think off when I think Zombie, and to make matters worse he looks completely out of place here. His cookie cutter family doesn't match him, his pretty boy persona in a world gone to the dogs doesn't match him, and his serious/stale acting style just doesn't fit the movie. This guys delivery could never make me think he's in any danger. No matter what situation you get, you always end up with the poker face Brad Pitt. Is he happy? Is he Scared? Is he angry? I don't know he uses the same expression and delivery for all those emotions. It's not Brad Pitt's fault this movie doesn't fit him though, this film is pretty predictable and bland to begin with. Aside from seeing Zombies pile up to form ladders that's about all that's new. The theory of stopping the zombies has been done before in other horror movies. This is the first time I think I've seen it done with Zombies though.The thing that doesn't make this film work though is that aside from the cheesy CGI zombies (which are so unbelievably obvious I thought I this was a PS3 game), the movie lacks the Zombie feel to it. It just feels like your typical action movie. It's more Action/Science Fiction than it is Horror. This is adapted from a book that I haven't read so I'm not sure the direction these zombies are supposed to go in. With Zombies it can be anything. They used to be Supernatural and the dead coming back to life, then people started to try to make it believable and added in the toxic chemical theories and then the virus theories which takes it from being supernatural horror to science fiction. This is kind of like ""I am Legend"" with the scientific approach to understanding and solving the issue.For me the movie fell apart when Brad Pit meets a certain group of folks that are nestled away working on a solution. They are all so clean cut,mentally together, and nonchalant about what's going on that it only reminds you how poorly executed this movie is in trying to make you feel like the Zombie outbreak has ended the world as we know it.The bottom line is that this movie is just a way to kill time. I actually paused it to run errands for a few hours then came back to it. It was that engaging! I'm not surprised though I rarely find myself enjoying Brad Pit movies. It's not that I dislike him or his acting, the roles he takes are never in movies that interests me. This seemed more like a Tom Cruise role I could see him playing the lead and actually making it interesting even if the dialogue is bland.",World War Z
1419248,"Absolutely excellent movie.I may actually have to buy the blu-ray of this movie. I've basically quit buying movies and just rent/stream them. However, I'd love to see the blu-ray copy and hear it crystal clear through my surround sound.Very well made, well acted, and well paced. A good long movie that doesn't disappoint.",The Dark Knight Rises
1312263,"Bottom line first: the Last Station consists of many good pieces. There's some wonderful acting some beautiful scenery a couple of ideas to kick around but there's not enough here to make a great movie or a particularly good entertainment. Opinion on this movie is sufficiently divided such that I'm going to recommend you rent it once before committing to buying your own copy.The driving conflict central to this movie is the historical reenactment of the disagreement between a dying Count Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer) and his wife the Countess Sophia (Helen Mirren). The great author in fact had become something of a mystic and a socialist in his old age. He had been born to a certain amount of wealth and had added to it with his brilliant writing. But his philosophies were not the kind that insured wealth for his legitimate children. He would die before the Russian revolution and so never had to compare his ideals to the hermaphrodite communism that would subject more than two generations of Russians to what was called dictatorship of the proletariat but operated more like a dictatorship of the apparatchiks. Countess Sophia is of the aristocratic tradition deeply concerned with the practical problems of funding their aristocratic children. The immediate case of this philosophic this agreement was the Count's determination to sign over copyrights to all of his books to the people of Russia. The Countess was equally determined to ensure that the Tolstoy wealth would be preserved for the Tolstoy children.Around at the central argument there are fleeting references to the Tolstoian's a more or less idealistic communalist group of youths who are attempting to build a village around their inspiration's philosophies. Within this group our attention is focused on Valentin (James McAvoy) and Masha(Kerry Condun). These two are supposed to represent, I suppose youthful ideology and the beauty of the human animal or something or another. Perhaps they are supposed to be in youth something of what Tolstoy and his various lovers were in his youth. Besides the fact that they are lovely young couple and engage in very healthy sex is not much reason for them to be in this movie at some point they do become observers of the larger plot and I suppose how they react to each other is supposed to be a lesson but if you haven't figured it out yet this is all very vague.Helen Mirren and Christopher Plummer perform their roles brilliantly a task slightly easier for them because their roles and purposes are more clearly defined. In fact the two female leads Helen Mirren and Kerry Condon portray strong-willed spirited women every bit the equal of the men in their lives. Given the vacillations of Valentin, Mesha is in control of their relationship.The movie was shot in Germany but succeeds in capturing something of the beauty of a remote Russian estate.It is possible to list a number of aspects of this movie that are worthy of your time. These parts do not come together because at base the central conflict is talked out without by itself making up a full movie script. From the supporting cast there is good acting, from the writers some good writing. There are  good costumes.  All are kind of thrown in in an effort to turn this into a full length movie. I cannot say that I hate this movie. There's more to like than dislike but I'm not sure this is more than a ""one viewer"". The young lovers certainly give you something to at which to look. The dialogue gives you much to think about; but I'm not sure The Last Station ever comes together.",N/A

Now I am delighted to see the film in HD on blu-ray.Ron Howard directed A Beautiful Mind and Russell Crowe, a native of New Zealand, gave an excellent portrayal of a West Virginia mathematician. Jennifer Connally and Ed Harris are fine supporting actors.This role for Russell Crowe, which came early in his movie career, was atypical for Crowe, who is best known as the Gladiator.

The attention to detail and the fun references to the first Boondock Saints movie, make it a must for Boondock fans, IMHO.  It isn't as brutally violent as the first movie, although violence permeates this one as well.  The addition of Julie Benz as the female FBI agent is brilliant! Her entrance in the killer red and black heels is a classic.  I bought this as a gift, but the person I bought it for was unenthusiastic based on the negative reviews, so I opened and watched it before sending it off.

1578881,"The first half of this movie is very good, refreshingly low-key and original, with a believable, slowly-developing romance between Morgan and Dean in Inwood, the far northern tip of Manhattan almost never seen in movies. The relaxed, small-town, almost rural character of the place is a welcome change from the frantic pace, hard-edged greed and shallow posturing that dominate in the more fashionable areas downtown where most movies are made. The city used to have many such low-key neighborhoods that we never see in movies, so it's good to see this one while it still exists.Unfortunately, the movie sort of disintegrates in its second half. Producers Akers and Berg must have thought a simple love story would be too boring, so they shoehorned a boatload of dramatic tension into the gentle, lovely story and ruined it. There are no gay-beating thugs, which is the stock drama-injector in gay movies, and its absence here is a great relief; but the absurd and highly annoying behavior of the main character is even more infuriating in a different, if much less hackneyed, way.A consistent delight throughout the movie, though, is Jack Kesy's gentle but powerful performance as Dean. He is unfailingly marvelous... so good that he makes the movie worth watching despite its significant flaws and Leo Minaya's much more heavy-handed and less believable performance as Morgan.",Morgan

1685806,"Given the familiarity that many people have with the plot of Gravity (2013 release; 90 min.), I will dispense with a short introduction of the movie, and instead will delve straight into my thoughts and comments.First and foremost, the photography in this movie is nothing short of stunning, in every sense of the word. The movie starts with an uninterrupted shot lasting a number of minutes as we get to know the characters played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I found myself staring at the big screen in total shock and awe (and I mean that as a compliment). Just when you think that's it's all form over substance, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, previously best known for Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n (2001) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), in fact fleshes out the Sandra Bullock enough that we care for her and that we are emotionally invested, a key ingredient for any movie to be truly successful. And just when you think that you've seen it all, there is yet more to come. I was very impressed with Sandra Bullock's performance, and the buzz about her being nominated for Best Actress Oscar is certainly deserved. Last but certainly not least, I very much enjoyed the musical score by Steven Price (the soundtrack is available on Amazon).Bottom line: this movie truly is a one-of-a-kind movie, and a unique experience that you will best enjoy on the big screen and in 3D. (This movie is the best use of 3D since ""Avatar"".) If you haven't seen ""Gravity"" yet, believe the hype and do yourself a favor and go see this in the theatre. ""Gravity"" is HIGHLY&lt; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",N/A

1589603,"To make the points that the filmmaker wishes to make, 56 UP uses a great deal of past previously seen footage.  Also the order of appearances is not organized probably because the storytelling is more important.It will dawn on everyone how only successfully pursuing a top notch, yuppie career education is the only safe route to take.  Low-income inheritance in Chinese is d&#299;sh&#333;ur&ugrave; y&iacute;chu&aacute;n which isThe social phenomenon that children from low-income families will likely also have low-income jobs when they grow up because they lack access to better education and other resources.BUT all the worries and drawbacks in the lives of the less successful participants especially Neil and Tony highlight the difference between the English and the Germans and unfortunately for the Eastenders and Neil, that is more important than a few more barristers in England.  The English may dislike what has happened to their country but they haven't turned to murderous hate.The Eastenders are declaring the same problem in England as is happening in America - there are people on Welfare, being heavily subsidized who should not be.

1440600,"My real reason for writing this review, the theme song. I could not get that song out of my head and the clips were always too short to Soundhound it. Well I finally found the song. It is Second Chance by Peter Bjorn and John. There aren't many television show theme songs that stand alone (Taxi was a notable exception). Second Chance is actually a really good song. The song is a huge surprise because the vocals of the song are never played on the show.Gimme SomeThis is one of my guilty pleasures. Two Broke Girls is an edgy dirty show. I hate to admit that I'm addicted to this show. Whitney Cummings humor is so edgy and funny. Kat Dennings as Max is perfectly cast, just the right mix of everything. During season one Caroline played by Beth Behrs frankly annoyed me. But as seasons two and three have aired, her character has softened and become more likeable.Stifler's Mom? Amazing casting choice (Jennifer Coolidge) for Sophie. Garret Morris (Saturday Night Live 1975-1980 - the outstanding early years) as Earl is underplayed to perfection. With only a few lines he carries a strong presence. Oleg, Jonathan Kite, is so disgusting. Anybody that has worked in a kitchen knows an Oleg. Making him Sophie's sex slave is genius. The show went just a little too far with Han as the butt of certain jokes. I'm glad they settled that down to more jokes about him and how he acts as opposed to any stereotypes - that took some doing to get those jokes just right. Matthew Moy as Han is an excellent actor. During season one he was more like Jon Cryer on Two and a Half Men - can't ever do anything right.There is a lot of just on the edge sex humor. Kat is quick to fill in the double entendre or flat out dirty remark. I like Denning and Behrs' chemistry. Whitney Cummings as writer on this show is much better than her self titled show, Whitney.I didn't give this show much of a chance to survive the first season.

And it starts and ends with the music which I haven't really heard properly played. I very much suspect it's the Conductor who is the guilty party. With his stodgy tempi and total lack of command over the score he literally grinds the work into the ground. (He is not alone, I've seen  this happen e.g. when Placido Domingo tried his hand in conducting at the Met and simply ruined Romeo & Juliet, Anna Netrebko notwithstanding).When I hear you gentlemen raving about this show, but I do detect a note of uncertainty here and there, I really have my doubts on your musical appreciation.Add to all this a ludicrously stupid story that makes no sense + a staging that makes a joke of the opera. This may be a good idea except we never know if the Composer himself intended it to be a joke or the Director consistent enough to carry it through. The English critics weren't too kind to this show (and they generally know what they are talking about), and the audience apparently left in droves during the first intermission.This being said I welcome any suggestions for a GOOD recording of this opera.

157588,"Sorry Johnny Depp, you incurred the wrath of Warren Oates when you dabbled in a role he mastered. With 10 times the charisma, Oates puts Depp to shame even on a bad day. Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson) goes after the Dillinger gang with extreme prejudice- machine gunning them in bed or even on the toilet if he can get away with it! The fearless outlaw cleans out banks, finds love, brilliantly bluffs his way out of jail, and dodges thousands of bullets. As Dillinger, Oates tears up the screen and intimidates everyone even when behind bars. After the bank bailouts a few years ago, this ""enemy of the people"" can be seen in a more favorable light. Harry Dean Stanton, Ben Johnson, the under-rated John Ryan, and the always reliable Geophrey Lewis give great support in this action packed historical pic. Michelle Phillips is a pretty face as Dillinger's woman. Cloris Leachman is a nice little hottie who makes an impression with little screen time.

I suppose a TV series wouldn't go very far with a misanthropic main character that diluted medicines, which caused the death of many hospitalized children  injured during WWII.Despite this quandary, Michael Rennie is exquisitely handsome as Harry and imminently entertaining as he James Bonds it all over the globe.Another curiosity is Nancy boy Jonathan Harris as Bradford Webster, Harry's treasurer and traveling companion. In the episodes I've seen, a stonily silent Harris mostly sits ramrod straight, hands in lap like a proper lady, or he stands frozen like a statue, staring into space while a thug creeps up from behind and conks his dome with a pistol butt.

Webster is also the slightly annoyed tsk-tsking observer of Lime's many clinches with attractive young gals.So, THE THIRD MAN is a peculiar TV series, yet I've enjoyed the episodes presented on this small Timeless Media compilation.Note that dubs have the grayness of second or third (man) generation copies, but are quite watchable, with no noticeable edit breaks or scratch lines. The TMG watermark that appears at lower right screen isn't overly distracting, and audio is quite acceptable for half-century-old 16mm broadcast films.More episodes would be nice, perhaps this time sans mfr. logo.",N/A

There's enough loosely tagged history to keep it interesting, with enough fiction to spark the imagination.I personally love the fact that women are portrayed as capable, courageous, daring - way to go!

230608,"Back in 2010, a number of film websites announced that Synapse Films acquired the negatives of the elusive three Hammer Film titles which were much sought after by collectors.  'HANDS OF THE RIPPER', 'TWINS OF EVIL' and 'VAMPIRE CIRCUS' all released in 1970 were the only titles not available on Digital transfers .  Available in the 90's on imported Laser Discs or VHS copies, these were the severely edited versions released to US theaters and were not seen since their original theatrical runs in Europe.  Well, Synapse kept to their word and released one film each summer restoring the films to their most complete running times culminating in this last title Director Peter Sasdy's 'HANDS OF THE RIPPER', a different type of Ripper film and which emerges as Hammer's most tragic and poignant film in its repertoire.  Heavily hyped as one of the company's most gruesome titles, it shows how Hammer was particularly scrutinized by the critics for its use of gory set pieces yet US grind house and Drive-in theaters were flooded with European Giallo and exploitation films showing far worse than Hammer ever conjured. It is wonderful that Synapse has allowed audiences that have never experienced the film before to see it for what it truly is, an exercise in psychological terror utilizing a Pygmalion motif and serial killer theme predating the Slasher film cycle by almost a decade.  It does boast an excellent cast headed by Eric Porter playing the medical doctor, Jane Merrow as a handicapped heroine and in an outstanding performance, Angharad Rees as Anna, the daughter of Jack The Ripper. The film is one of Hammer's best and show the direction the studio could have taken if not for the fan hunger for another Dracula/Frankenstein release and more gore along with it. Bonus features includes a 28 minute featurette 'THE DEVIL'S BLOODY PLAYTHING-POSSESSED BY HANDS OF THE RIPPER showing the evolution of the film and a brief history of its Producer Aida Young with interviews by many writers and actress Jane Merrow and Director Peter Sasdy.  Unfortunately, Angharad Rees passed away in 2012 but their is an audio interview with her which is interspersed throughout the featurette.  There is a startling motion still gallery of rare images called 'SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENCE-THE EVOLUTION OF HAMMER GORE' which highlights the studios gorier moments from their library of titles, the US 1976 Television introduction which was filmed to fill up the running time due to the excessive cuts to the print, a stills gallery for the film, original trailers and TV spots , and an isolated music and effects track only found on the Blu-Ray disc and which gets you to appreciate composer Christopher Gunning's hauntingly underrated score.  The Blu-Ray is in a gorgeous 1.85 1080P transfer with not a blemish or speckle to be found with a DTS-HD MA English 2.0 mono track.  This film along with the other Hammer titles belongs in every Horror fans library and hats off to Synapse for fulfilling their promise and  allowing audiences to appreciate this underrated title from Hammers heyday.",Hands of the Ripper VHS

1346904,"There are quite a few quicky direct-to-video films out there done in the style of the old sci-fi & monster movies from the 50's & 60's as homages. Sadly, most of the spoof flicks I've sat thru simply aren't all that amusing. But Larry Blamire gets it. His Lost Skeleton films are not only amusing and affectionate spoofs that honor their source material, but they also manage to be genuinely funny. And not just a few smirks or an occasional chuckle, but outright belly laughs are to be found in his work. I have shown the first Skeleton to a few friends and while not fans of the old movies it pokes fun of, they got the concept and were laughing right along. That's the sign of good comedy. Everyone gets the humor not just a select few.I need to get his Old Dark house spoof (Dark & Stormy Night) and his goofy-looking Trail of the Screaming Forehead. I understand he's working not only on a third Lost Skeleton film, entitled The Lost Skeleton Walks Among Us, but he and another fellow (Cleve Hall) are joining forces on a giant monster/Godzilla spoof called GADZOOKA! As a big fan of Japanese giant monsters, THAT bit of news really has my interest peaked!Film looks good and has a solid picture and good audio. No scratches, print damage or compression issues (pixelation or artifacting), but it's a new film so that's to be expected. No audio issues either:(buzzing, hissing dropouts). Not much in the way of extras, but for a little independent film, I don't find that to be a problem. The film is funny and worth repeat viewings. Thanks for the laughs, Larry!

1571629,"It is fitting that Director Pietro Francisci who gave us the original 'HERCULES' aka 'LE FATICHE DI ERCOLE' -1958 and its superb sequel 'HERCULES UNCHAINED' aka 'ERCOLE E LA REGINA DI LIDIA'- 1959 both starring Steve Reeves would return to the genre six years later to deliver one of the last and best of its type 'HERCULES, SAMSON, & ULYSSES' aka 'ERCOLE SFIDA SANSONE'- 1964.  By this time the European sword and sandal pepla were in decline tag teaming every conceivable muscleman against hokey villains and card board monsters.  Here we have a good script by Francisci making the film a prequel to the biblical Samson and Delilah story and intertwining it with characters of Greek mythology.  The production values are excellent and the acting above average for a film of this type even making the English dubbing palatable. Kirk Morris who was no stranger to the genre having played in Director Ricardo Freda's underrated 'MACISTE IN HELL' aka 'MACISTE AL'INFERNO' -1963 (beware the wretched television print titled 'THE WITCH'S CURSE' which totally distorts the storyline) and many others.  Liana Orfei makes a fetching Delilah and Samson and Ulysses are aptly portrayed by Richard Lloyd and Enzo Cerusico never burying the film in hokey shenanigans and comic relief which was so prolific in these final forays.  Hercules's wife Iole and young son appear in cameo making this a sequel to the first 1950's films.  With a rousing score by Angelo Francisco Lavagnino known for his melancholic music for Director Eugene Lourie's monster epic 'GORGO'- 1961 and crisp cinematography by Silvano Ippoliti , this film comes highly recommended for fans of these actioners.

The best part about this movie is that you will never see one battle scene or any type of killing in this entire movie. Those details are left to your own imagination to fill in. Stephen Boyd the other top actor in this film, portrays an Irish espionage agent working for the nazis. I especially enjoyed all the checking details that he went through to prove that &#34;Major Willie Martin&#34; of the British Royal Marines was just a British ploy.

Each movie is crisp and bright with good sound unlike many of low quality collections we have seen of them in the past. These are the classic Bowery Boys films we watched for years on Saturday Afternoon.Volume two picks up where one left off. 12 more more classic films on 4 DVDs. Just simple packaging a standard DVD case that houses the 4 movies. But hey who cares we are buying these for the movies not the packaging. I will highly recommend you grab this high quality set while they are available.,The Bowery Boys: Volume Two

1556651,"This is a heartwarming tale of a Somali pirate who finally realizes his dream of coming to America.Throughout the movie he says to himself, if he is strong and believes in himself (paraphrase), everything will turn out right. And it does. Kind of.OK. Seriously, though. First, be aware that this film may be a whitewash of the real Captain Phillips; his crew says they in fact warned him repeatedly about entering pirated waters, but he ignored them. And so on. I don't know whom to believe, but just FYI.Second, the good Captain does things which don't make sense. He ignores the warning of his crew that the first encounter will be followed-up, and they should haul, er, butt. He says if they do, they'll run into other pirates anyway. This decision allows the pirates to catch up. Then, after telling the crew to hide and under no circumstances be captured to be held hostage, he stays on the bridge and ... is held hostage.Third, he is constantly saying things to his captors which would probably irritate them rather than calm them down. Look for these nuggets. I cringed each time.Otherwise, this film is suspenseful, not exactly action-packed, but thrilling nevertheless. This is due in no small part to the actors who play the wild-eyed pirates, looking scary as all get-out. You see how they're recruited into a ruthless, greedy pirate ring, constantly demanding and yelling and threatening. You feel a bit sorry for them.They say they're forced into this life because of big fishing boats which get all their fish. I don't know if this is true or not. But they apparently use this as their excuse for violence and theft.You get to see how comedically useless the ""non-lethal"" defenses of a big ship are against pirates - they blithely weave in between water jets and shoot open pirate cages.And we sympathize with the crew, who complain that they are unarmed against dangerous thugs. We can pontificate all day about how un-nice it is to have armed security on ships, but I guarantee the day you spot a skiff of armed criminals on course with your ship, you'll be wishing you had a bazooka - certainly after watching this team of khat-addled goons.You'll see the full force of the US Navy swing into action to rescue this one man. And you'll make no mistake - these are the good guys. And consummate professionals, carrying out what seems a convoluted plan (what's that with making big wakes, stopping the tow, etc.?).There is more waiting than I had expected. There is Jason Bourne Jerky-Cam in the lifeboat, which might make you seasick. Nothing actually happens a lot of the time there, just some threatening and panicking. The Captain's interactions with the pirates there seem somewhat random and without any real plan, except to apparently antagonize them more.There is a semi-happy ending, as the pirate team lead, Muse, makes his way to the United States.I enjoyed it, but it's not a five-star movie to me. This is partly due to all the hype around it as an action-packed thriller. Maybe 3.5?",N/A

1140357,"Eric Bana as Romulus gives a remarkable performance as a Central European immigrant to Australia trying to raise his son, Raimond, on a farm outside Frogmore, Victoria, Australia, while his wife, Raimond's mother, appears and disappears from their lives.At nine years old, the precocious Raimond insists on remaining a boy despite the demands from the adults around him that he take up the roles they are unwilling or unable to fill.Romulus' best friend Hora (Marton Csokas) is inspirational in his support of his best friend and his best friend's son.  In some ways Hora is an even more solid role model for Raimond than Romulus though both Romulus and Hora are hard-working, honorable men.Raimond's almost perpetual playfulness, determination, and ability to live in his own happy moment despite what is going on around him carries the story and the film through otherwise soul-breaking tragedies.Unfortunately this DVD did not include English subtitles.

Therefore I had a special appreciation for a theme of this kind.  I thought Clifton Webb did a splendid job of portraying the British officer in charge of Operation Mincemeat.

1129848,"One of the first adult novels I ever read was ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", and it helped introduce me to a whole world of historical fiction, despite the mixed opinions about it. I, like so many others, was far less than impressed with the Hollywood adaptation with Natalie Portman and Eric Bana, so when I found this I thought I had finally found a decent version. Surely, of all people, the BBC would get this right, wouldn't they? Unfortunately, no.While it is a bit more faithful to the novel, and I do like the casting better (this was Tudor times; Mary and Anne were not ""Hollywood"" stunning*) there are too many low points to make this a decent movie.- Firstly, and the most terrible of all, is that for some unfathomable reason this film is shot like a documentary. Anne and Mary actually talk to the camera as if they're on Real World: England; there is even an instance where one of the sisters goes running across the castle grounds in her nightshift, and the camera not only goes to night vision, it is pointed at the ground!- The costumes are absolutely terrible. Mary's teal gable hood is a complete disaster, with a strange, stiff white bit that honestly looks like a piece of plastic. They truly look like sometime from a cheap costume shop.- Mary is depicted as being the conspirator behind George and Anne's incest, which is also depicted as having happened. While one might argue that this is fiction after all, if we are following the book series continuity, it is proved in ""The Boleyn Inheritance"" that Jane Parker lied out of spite.- Henry literally gives not one care upon hearing the news that Mary has given birth to a son, due to his newfound infatuation with Anne. Let me just say that again. A King, a man who had the whole country in celebration for the birth of his first born (bastard) son and is constantly praying for another, barely blinks an eye at the news that his mistress has just given birth to a healthy baby boy. We all know Henry, that simply would not have happened.- I don't know what kind of camera they filmed this with, but the entire film is terribly grainy.- THE ENDING. Remember how I mentioned that it's shot like a documentary? The film ends with modern day footage of tourists around the memorial where the executions took place while Mary does a voice over stating that her brother and sister went to the scaffold after being declared guilty. That's it. No heart wrenching speech before Anne loses her head, nothing.- The romance between Mary and William Stafford is so sudden, it seems like some sort of Romeo and Juliet situation, having barely known each other before getting married.I could probably go on and on about all the things wrong about this film, but then my review would be as tedious to read as this movie was to watch. The only part I actually enjoyed was Anne's temper showing through when she sat at Henry's side and asked Henry which of the women in the room was his ""syphilitic whore."" It shows you how Anne (the Gregory Anne) went from a girl who only ever wanted to be happy to a power hungry woman desperate to keep her bum firmly planted on the throne.*You may argue that the casting of the Showtime show ""The Tudors"" has some pretty beautiful women playing the parts of Henry's queens, but we at least get to see them at vulnerable times, sometimes with their eyes red and puffy, faces covered in sweat and dirt, and at hideous low points in their lives. If I recall correctly, not a hair was out of place on Scarlet Johansson's head after giving birth to Catherine.",The Other Boleyn Girl

As Will and Ann piece together the disturbing puzzle, they discover that the story of the last man to leave Will's dream house will be just as horrifying to the one who came next.The cast led by Daniel Craig (as Will), Naomi Watts (as Ann) & Rachel Weisz (as Libby) is great.

1356392,"It really doesn't matter how many times you watch these shows, each Christmas they help get you into the Christmas spirit. And even though I remember them from when I was a kid, I now find I still enjoy watching them with my daughter.With this Blu-ray set, you get four of these classic films. On disc one, there is the 51 minute film &#8220;Santa Claus is Comin' to Town.&#8221; This has been digitally remastered and the picture is the best I've ever watched this film, but you do have to remember they were working off the old masters and it is not the same picture as new HD filmed movies. This is still a great version of this film. Audio in English or Spanish. Unfortunately, there are no other extras on the disc.Disc two contains three shorter classics with a run time of approximately 100 minutes for all three. You get &#8220;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (52 minutes),&#8221; &#8220;Frosty the Snowman (25 minutes),&#8221; and &#8220;Frosty Returns (23 minutes).&#8221; Simple menu screen comes up right away (as it did in first DVD) and you can choose between the three films. You get a choice of playing the movie or selecting chapters. Like the first disc, this is the best I've ever seen these films as far as picture goes, but again, it is not the same as something made today.&#8220;Santa Claus is Comin' to Town&#8221; and &#8220;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&#8221; are our favorites of this collection, but having the &#8220;Frosty&#8221; films included are okay too. But they don't compare to the first two, and it is those first two that we wanted this set for. It is nice to watch them with the sharpest picture available and no commercials. However, these movies in standard DVD are just as fun to watch, so the budget minded buyer would be well served at buying the standard edition set.I think they could have added more films to the Blu-ray set, such as &#8220;The Little Drummer Boy&#8221; or put them on one disc. The set as it is is still nice, but I think it could have been better.Bottom line, if you are a fan of these Christmas Classics, it is nice to have them on this digitally remastered Blu-ray set for the holidays.

1423562,"I liked this movie, being a fan of the zombie genre.  My rating of four stars presumes that you are a fan of the horror / zombie genre and not looking for Oscar-worthy cinema.  Be warned, the movie is in German.  The movie is sub-titled and I was able to ""read"" and follow the movie with no problem but I know many folks dislike (or hate) having to ""read"" a movie.This is not a long movie -- just over 60 minutes -- but does not feel like a ""short film"".  The movie follows Michael, who has come to Berlin in an effort to see (and re-connect) with his ex-girlfriend.  As he enters her block of apartments, he (and we) hear yelling and gunshots in the distance.  Michael finds the apartment, but his love is not there.  He is then confronted with the outbreak and ends up trapped in the apartment with a young plumber's assistant.  There is an interesting ""rear window"" dynamic between various characters trapped in their apartments but able to see and communicate with their neighbors (this block of apartments faces a central courtyard).  The characters are believable in their actions and quirks, which is not always the case for zombie movies and helps make this a superior zombie film.From a ""technical"" perspective, this is a viral outbreak movie where the infected become white eyed, mouth frothing homicidal maniacs (a la 28 Days Later or the American version of Rec).  The zombies are ""fast shamblers"" and our heroes discover they are sensitive to light (which becomes part of the obligatory PLAN the survivors come up with to escape).So put on your reading glasses, grab a German beer (but not so many as to slow your reading) and enjoy.","Siege Of The Dead (a.k.a.

Now, your ears are still ringing and you can not understand a word being said.  Like, I say, this movie is sound perfect from a guy with two hearing aids.

1327653,"This is a movie genre called ""bad on purpose"". Of course it is low budget. It's almost designed to be comedy, but without the explicit intentiom to make you laugh or be in the AIRPLANE or TOP SECRET vein.The producers gives clues all the time to make you wonder ""how bad is that"", or ""how ludcricouse this extra or special effect is"" or ""how is possible such absurd continuity error""? But it is all on purpose, even the amazing corny lines.Example 1: our Seal hero and main character is toutrageously wooden face, obviously on purpose (Firch, I think was his name) is in a hot car chase with the bad guys. At the front seat with him is the girl scientist (Tiffany) and at the back seat is another scientist. But, in a lot os shots during the car chase, and I mean clearly visible an explicit shots at broad daylight), Firch is alone in the car. Absolutelyt nobody with him.Example 2: Firch is batlling the piranhas at the ende of the mvoei, while Tiffany and other top guys from the US governemnt are monitoring it. Ouf of the blue, Tiffany says the wonderful line by the radio: ""Come on baby, you're doung fine!.Example 3: I could not skip the marvellous becaj scene when a woman is hit by a PIranha at the beach line. Firch runs to her and says: ""Take it wasy, everything will be alright"", and the womans dies the next second. Soon after, Firch is attacked by a bunch of piranhas. He lays back at the sand and fends all of them by kicking them away...It's all on purpose. It has its fun moments. But, is it worth the minutes you lose of your life watching it? I don't know. I lost mine.",Mega Piranha

1602684,"Outstanding performances from the young ensemble cast, especially Tyler Ross (star ofNate & Margaret) highlight this dramatic film which actually follows 2 very deep storylines.  The primary focus is on teenager Tim (played by Ross) as he maneuvers his Baptist upbringing with the realization he is gay.  His closest friends take 2 sides as they come to terms with something that challenges their faith.Meanwhile, Austin (played by Stephen Cone) is the involved church member.  He and his wife are leading the church production.  As Tim begins to accept and embrace his sexuality (alongside a supportive father), the event triggers Austin to question his own sexuality.  Dramatic and complex, everything changes, more so for Austin than Tim.  A visible stark contrast is present between the two experiences.  After all, for Tim, college life and his entire future await.  For Austin, the challenge is far more engrossing - a prominent church position, a wife - what are his next steps?If only films like this would make it mainstream - it would do the world well to see the comprehensive battles individuals face during coming out, especially for those late in life.The production is a mix of Lifetime Movie meets Afterschool Special meets Christian programming.  At times, the acting / flow can be quite annoying but overall, the production - and the message - carries the film.  No doubt a low-budget production, the music soundtrack is actually quite impressive.  For me, one of the most endearing scenes was the birthday dance, which featured the song ""Crosswalk Stereo"" by The Pass.  Parts of the film, along with the character Tim reminded me of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", minus the big Hollywood financing.Watch carefully, and you'll catch the message in some of the final conversations in the closing scene.

48637,"I have problems with this film. I really like it, and many consider this Hitch's best, but not only do I like other Hitchcock films better, I believe that they really are better films. That would be 39 STEPS, THE LADY VANISHES, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, REBECCA, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REAR WINDOW and NORTH BY NORTHWEST for starters.As for VERTIGO, I was enthralled by the whole Carlotta Valdez mystery and sucked into the unraveling of exactly who was who and what was really going on. Great movie up until Madeleine takes the plunge.Now all of the implausibilities crop up.Wouldn't Scottie have at least seen that the corpse wasn't his Madeleine? Well, considering his mental state, maybe not... But newspaper photos? In court he would have to identify photos of the body.And why would Gavin Elster dream up such an far-fetched scheme to do in his wife? Film Noir would have certainly come up with a simpler solution. Have some hired thug bump her off then skip town. This murder is way too complicated.What's in this for Judy? A few bucks? She goes through a lot of deception for a paycheck, and when she realises what is really going on, why doesn't she go to the police? Elster certainly doesn't pay her enough to quit her maundane office job. Is he now looking to bump her off too, to tie up loose ends? Is she hiding from him? Doesn't she care enough about Scottie to help him through this?And what's the chance that Scottie would run into Judy on the busy San Francisco streets by accident? I rarely run into my neighbors in the grocery store and I live in a small town. I guess I have to get out more often.And why would they hold the trial at the Mission, a tourist attraction? To attract more tourists?I don't know...I think that the movie would have worked much better if Gavin Elster wasn't trying to murder his wife, if it all wasn't just a ruse. If Scottie and Madeleine became envolved, with Scottie becoming obsessed and finally driving a frighten Madeleine to her death from atop the tower. A death deemed an accident.And then, a year or so later, Scottie spots a girl on the street, becomes obsessed by her, and as he begins to change her into Madeleine, we, the audiance, now become aware of the true depth his madness as her forces this girl to literally become someone else, and eventually frightening her into that same eventual nightmare fall from the Mission tower as before.But that's just the way I would have liked to have seen it done.I love this film, there's so much good going for it. It's one of my most watched Hitchcock films, I keep coming back to it, like salmon swimming upstream. But I still have my misgivings, simply because it just doesn't really make much sense (when it could), and I guess, in an artistic sense it really doesn't need to. But I also truly believe that if it did make sense, it would ultimately be a better film, perhaps the best American film (made by a British director) ever!The Universal dvd, the one with Jimmy Stewart in close-up, is just great.

It's almost like the screenwriters have amalgamated the characteristics of Jean Luc Besson's two heroines and infused her with some bada** Uma Thurman Kill Bill moves...I admit that I had some trepidation when I watched the trailer - which looked a little far fetched - a kid in an action role?  But the film is utterly convincing as Hanna kicks some serious i-can't-say-the-word-on-Amazon.With strong casting and support from Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett (it's getting a bit ""old"" that Cate gets casted in the baddie roles again and again but she's still compelling)...director Joe Wright has made a very nice action film that trumps a lot of Hollywood fodder any day.  The film has a heart too, which is nice.  Adding a few quirky David Lynch touches here and there, Hanna is a very well made, stylish thriller.Lead actress Saoirse (whose name is difficult to spell and pronounce) has a future in the movies, for sure.

So the good group has the evil ones to worry about, and there's the zombies that only come out at night.This is basically a slow-paced film that is overlong, lacking overall with lots of zombies, has poor scenery, no nudity, is talky in parts, and it needs more effective atmosphere. Most of the film takes place in these 2 locations with the good guys being sometimes attacked and harassed by the evil group, and there's the zombies that the walk the earth at night. The directing is decent, and it has some nice and gory practical effects; there's some good FX work here. However, I wanted a more action-packed film. The film uses practical gore effects instead of CGI, and I liked some of the gore scenes. There's a little bit of suspense in some parts when they must remain indoors at night because the zombies emerge, but they could've done a lot more with these sequences and made them more claustrophobic and suspenseful; it fails to gain any of the suspense and claustrophobia that is present in some of Romero's films.

1013497,"Like it or not, Star Trek: The Animated Series is an undeniable part of the Star Trek Universe of products.  I, for one, loved these episodes, as they gave me an opportunity to hear more stories from the wonderful ST:TOS franchise.  Just like all of the Star Trek series, there are some excellent episodes, and some which are less successful.  But considering the entire package, it's really essential to own this if you are a true Star Trek fan.Some really interesting things about this series:1. New characters which were easier to demonstrate in an animated setting, like Lieutenant M'Ress and Lieutenant Arex2. New villains which might have made for some interesting story fodder had they appeared in the other shows, like the Kzinti3. A versatility in voice acting by some of our major characters, including the late great James Doohan4. One of my favorite concepts in all of Star Trek, taken to a new level in the episode ""Yesteryear""Some negatives about this series (although not strong enough to tamper my enthusiasm in this review) include less than optimal animation techniques; reuse of voice-overs; and ineffective utilization of the animated approach to tackle ideas that were otherwise prohibitive in the live environment.Bottom line...if you are a true Star Trek fan, you have to have this as part of your collection.

1123109,"This is an excellent film, the cinematography is beautiful, the story-telling compelling, and it is based on an equally excellent book. Emile Hirsch is pitch perfect as young Christopher McCandless, a suburban kid who thinks he can go ""into the wild"" and make it his own.  Hirsch's acting is reserved but nuanced. His gestures are spare but speak volumes.  And then there's the scenery.  From the Sea of Cortez to the Grand Canyon to the Denali wilderness, it's breathtaking.  This is a movie that engrosses you from start to finish.But lordy, that Mccandless kid was a sorry piece of work. The film does not portray the boy as a hero, but neither does it delve into the selfishness of this naive young man. Many reviewers find much to admire about him him as a free spirit and 'idealist.'  Idealist my big toe.What is idealistic about willful ignorance and a sense of entitlement? The kid goes into one of the most challenging and threatening environments on the planet without having clue one about what he's getting into, without adequate supplies and without a map.  Idealism is best saved for politics and philosophy. In the wild, you need a willingness to learn. McCandless was so used to his family providing a safety net, it never occured to him that Nature would not bow to his needs as well. The movie, by the way, does hint that his parents are bad people because they offer the boy a new car when he graduates from high school and had the foresight to start a college fund for him.  We should all suffer such abuse.Chris McCandless certainly wanted people to think he was a selfless idealist, with his grandious handing over of his parent's money...not a cent of which he earned himself...to Oxfam. Plenty more where that came from, eh.  He also doesn't waste time and effort learning how to survive. ""Living off the land"" has such a nice ring to it...why lumber yourself with any useful information on how it is to be accomplished.  Naturally he becomes hopelessly lost. Naturally, after slaughtering a moose out of season, he eats a few bites and leaves the rest to rot. He doesn't even try to preserve it. What's so hard about slicing the meat thin and hanging it where the breeze hits it? It might not have worked, but he could have tried. His obliviousness is almost laughable: when he stumbles across an abandoned bus, which becomes his living quarters, he fails to connect the dots. Hello, it's a bus. Somebody drove it there, so there must be a road, probably right under the tires.  Probably the same road the bus driver used to to get out of the wilderness.Chris is no respecter of the wild, he's just lazy. Killing animals out of season impacts the species. So what. He was hungry. Even before getting to Alaska, he shows a woeful disrespect for nature; his trespassing in the Grand Canyon makes it clear he places far more importance on having fun than on preserving a wilderness.No, I don't think McCandless was an idealist. He was certainy tragic: a tragic example of a middle class, pampered child.Thoreau was an idealist and he didn't just wander blindly into the woods. He had some survival skills and certainly was wiling to learn more. Had he and the McCandless lad met, I would like to think that Henry David might have made an exception to his usual peace-loving ways.  I can picture him placing one sensible and well-worn boot on the kid's backside and propelling him back toward his natural habitat...the nearest McDonalds.",N/A

1662285,"CONTAINS SPOILERS SO PLEASE WATCH OUTWe wrote our first Dexter review at the end of S7 and threw up some possible story points for S8 (pretty unsuccessfully!).  There seems to be alot of early negative reviews here, relating to the season in general, but particularly with the ending and although we were disappointed too the 1 & 2 star ratings are way to harsh.After writing the S7 review we had hoped that the final season would eschew the standard Dexter formula and NOT introduce new characters and provide yet another serial/master killer.  The reason being that all S8 had to do was start at precisely where S7 ended and should have simply focused on Angel, sharply changing his mind about retiring, and with the full resources of Miami Metro behind him, aggressively investigate the murder of Maria (I mean, is there a fan out there who really did not want to see more of the immediate aftermath of Maria's murder..........particularly when Dexter & Deb went back to the party....and then the hours, days and weeks after!?).  Ultimately, the entire season would have revolved around the unit slowly piecing together evidence that points to Dexter being the killer (hell, you even had Angel find the warrants Maria had obtained for Dexters/Debs phone records!!).  The story turns/developments that could have been done would have been more than enough to fully flesh out the season without the unecessary tangents that this final season took.  In addition, it could have included and given more screen time to the main supporting characters (eg. Vince would have been pivotal in forensically identifying his 'hero' as the 'villain' & Quinn would have been divided by his affection for Deb).  There was alot to work with here!With the murder of Maria the final season was always going to be downbeat but even though we thought it would happen the death of Deb was still heartbreaking (particularly when the impression was that she might be allowed to survive.......but it appears the makers did want her, and Dexter, to pay the ultimate price for their actions).With a show that lasted 8 seasons, with fans investing so much time and caring for such appealing characters, the show should not have ended with so much ambiguity and so many loose ends and unanswered questions (to the point that the last few scenes seemed like an 11th hour tack on).  Not that we want to be spoon-fed but a certain amount of definitive closure should have been allowed for.Despite its failings S8 is still very good but contrary to the filmakers apparent endgame this is a show that demanded, and we hope most fans would agree and have accepted (and really wanted), a 'happy' ending.......with Dexter, Deb & Harrison making an escape when it was clear Miami Metro was on to them (how great would it have been to see the reactions of Angel, et al, once the evidence slowly revealed the truth about their great friend Dexter!?).Thanks once more to everyone involved with this marvellous programme that we will almost certainly never see its like again......but we will also kind of hate you because, at the moment, the first thing we think of when we now think of Dexter is that Deb dies.....hopefully that will fade in time.PS: a few more days have passed since we saw the final episode and the ending has gotten less and less acceptable.....to the point that our rating has reduced to 3.5 stars.  Apparently, we need better lives if we're still thinking about a TV show, huh!?",Dexter: The Complete Final Season

371353,"This 90-minute TNT miniseries is a dramatization of the Biblical story of Jacob in the Book of Genesis, but it only covers his life from the theft of his brother Esau's birthright to their reconciliation years later, with a heavy emphasis on his intervening struggles to marry Rachel despite her crafty father Laban's machinations. Acclaimed theatrical director Sir Peter Hall, founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, gives the film a style that is more stagey than cinematic, with lots of static shots lacking in dramatic flair. The casting is quite excellent with Matthew Modine, Sean Bean, Lara Flynn Boyle, Irene Papas, Joss Ackland, and Giancarlo Gianni offering richly subtle performances under the sure hand of Hall's direction. Some highlights include Jacob's theft of the birthright, the ""Jacob's Ladder"" dream sequence envisioned with good special effects, Jacob's overnight wrestling match with the angel who renames him Israel, Jacob's battle of wits with Laban, and the final reconciliation between the brothers. The battle of wits with Laban is probably the most entertaining stretch of the film. The editing in several of these sequences is surprisingly sharp, helping to compensate for the inherent dullness of this story, which is among the least memorable of many beautiful passages in the Book of Genesis. This is probably the best possible film of this material, but the material itself is weak, as the drama of Jacob's story is so internally focused that it is not easy to visualize in an involving way. Compared to the other very rich films produced by the same artists in the TNT Bible Collection and Trimark Bible Series, most of which are three hours long, this miniseries is also the weakest. It offers a relatively inconsequential story in only 90 minutes of film, an unusually weak Marco Frisina musical score, and acting that fails to move the viewer despite being technically sound. Compared to Matthew Modine, Martin Landau fares much better as an older Jacob in ""Joseph,"" the Emmy-winning miniseries that picks up this story at Shechem and relates the family conflicts of Jacob's wives and sons. Indeed, ""Joseph"" remains the best cinematic version of the shepherd stories that fill most of Genesis, but even the first TNT film ""Abraham"" (1994) with Richard Harris beats this one. Although it features the same historical authenticity and excellent costumes/locations as these other films, ""Jacob"" is just not in the same class as ""Moses"" with Ben Kingsley and ""David"" with Nathaniel Parker,"" which are rousing little epics even if they fall short of ""Joseph."" Nevertheless, ""Jacob"" is still lightyears better than the more recent Biblical epics released by these Italian production companies on the American DVD market -- such as ""Paul the Apostle with Johannes Brandrup -- which are entirely filled with badly dubbed European actors and cheaper production values. At least ""Jacob"" is a true collaboration between English and non-English speaking filmmakers, with good actors portraying the roles and a sure dramatic hand behind the camera. In summary, enjoy ""Jacob"" if you want to see a well-staged Biblical tale that is rarely filmed, but remember that there are better Biblical films in this series to enjoy afterwards.",N/A

These were specially trained assassins for the Emporer's protection, as well as doing away with anyone who threated him.

Also there are familiar faces that show up. Some that haven't been on for a while like Detective Cassidy and Dr. Olivet.

1673501,"I had first posted this review forThe Sound of Music Live!movie while watching it when it aired on NBCBut just because I HATE this version and expressed my opinion about it -- which, BTW is the WHOLE point of a writing a review (NOT to be insincere and falsely fawn over and flatter the subject with a review written through ""rose colored glasses""!) I was constantly bullied with insulting replies, and a low ""helpful review"" score, like nearly every other 1-star reviewer for this item.I was so MERCILESSLY attacked that I finally just took down my review altogether.However, after thinking about it for awhile, I decided that I am NOT going to give in to a bunch of intolerant bullies obsessed with stamping out any dissent. This is a HORRIBLE production of ""The Sound of Music"" and I am FAR from the only one who feels that way! Not only did Kym Karath, who played the youngest Von Trapp child, Gretel in the Julie Andrews version, post on Twitter about her disappointment and disgust with this production, but even the surviving Von Trapp family members did NOT approve of this production either.  Which is why I decided to write another review -- and I don't care if I'm flooded with insults, and given a ZERO ""helpful review"" score, I'm not going to let the bullies intimidate me anymore, because even if there are others who disagree, I have a right to my own opinion.Now, before going any further, I just have to say that I am a HUGE, HUGE fan of ""The Sound of Music"". Not only have I read theStory of the Trapp Family Singersthe biography/autobiography written by Maria von Trapp, but I also haveThe Sound of Music Family Scrapbookand TWO sets of ""The Sound of Music"" on DVD (theFive Star Collection EditionAND theTwo-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition) and incredibly, I'm still considering getting the movie on Blu-Ray at some point in the future (assuming that interest in online streaming does not completely take over/replace the Blu-Ray market!). I have also seen the Julie Andrews version literally probably at least a THOUSAND times (if not more!) since childhood, so many times that I pretty much know it by heart. So no one can say that I am not knowledgeable and a devoted & loyal fan of ""The Sound of Music"" -- and in my opinion, this live version with Carrie Underwood was a HUGE disappointment, and a TOTAL DISGRACE to the original with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews!!Even with all its hype, this production falls flat and the casting, the characters and the acting was all just AWFUL -- and even that is putting it kindly. I couldn't even get through a FEW MINUTES of this before I needed to change the channel and take a break -- and even though I switched back & forth from time to time (mainly to see if it'd get any better -- which it unfortunately did not) I couldn't get through more than a couple minutes of the movie each time, before I was itching to change the channel again!What is it with everyone producing such AWFUL remakes of ALREADY-GREAT musicals & movies likeThe Sound of MusicandAnnie??Carrie Underwood is awful as Maria!She has a good voice but it isn't the right one for this production and she doesn't have the acting ability to pull off the character in this remake. Sadly,  everything about Carrie in this role, from her hairstyle, to her clothes, to her acting ability (or sheer LACK thereof!) was just horrible -- and the word ""insulting"" doesn't even come close to being an adequate description. Even the surviving members of the von Trapp family didn't want Carrie in this role. She may be a great singer, but she definitely is NOT an actress! With years of practice that could change, but doing a live performance, particularly at this time was a huge mistake. Although Carrie's pretty & can sing pretty well, she sounds so whiny and annoying when she's pleading with the Mother Abbess not to send her away (to the Von Trapps) which brings to another point -- the HORRENDOUS casting of Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess!Now I am all for equality, justice and non-discrimination, and I absolutely abhor any kind of bigotry, racism & prejudice, but by the same token, there is also a lot to be said for being accurate and realistically true to history, especially when the setting of the work depicted is in past decades/centuries/millenniums. In all seriousness, what Catholic convent in 1930s Austria would have permitted an African-American woman to be the MOTHER ABBESS?!?During the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American woman even just being an ordinary nun would itself have been extremely unusual (if not even nonexistent!) ANYWHERE in the world, let alone in pre-Nazi era Austria -- but her being in a position of power (like being a Mother Abbess in charge of a convent) would unfortunately have NEVER have happened in that era. It's sad & unfortunate but during those ""Jim Crow"" days. prior to the incredible work done by heroes like Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X., Medgar Evers and others, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and its slowly increasing acceptance, neither black men and especially not black women were allowed to be in any positions of power. As the saying went back then, black women were relegated to being ""maids, mammies and mamas""! And what is it with casting Audra McDonald in every single remake?? She was also cast as Miss Grace Farrell in the remake ofAnnieand she was awful, not to mention historically inaccurate, there as well!This is NOT about either racism, multi-culturalism, or ""political correctness"" -- its about sheer historical inaccuracy, that stretches the limits of believability. Its like remakingGone with the Wind, and recasting Scarlett O'Hara with a Chinese woman, Rhett Butler with an African-American, Ashley Wilkes with a Latino, Melanie Hamilton with a Native American, India Wilkes with a woman from India (and I say that being of Indian descent myself!) and Mammy & Prissy with fair-skinned, blue-eyed blondes! Because that's what the ridiculous casting in these remakes basically amounts to -- changing the cast's characteristics, simply for the sake of political correctness and multi-culturalism, and the truth of history be damned!Unfortunately. the rest of the casting and acting in this movie is just as bad, if not worse!Nearly every character is unbearably annoying and petulant, and the way they deliver their lines so forcefully, it almost sounds like they were under duress to say it. Rather than being lovable and adorable like the von Trapp children (especially Gretel) in the original movie were, the kids come off as total brats. Even most kids taken off the street could act better than the von Trapp children or even Carrie Underwood or Steven Moyer in this movie. Instead of being the stern but basically loving Captain like in the movie, this Captain Von Trapp just comes off as an irritating, heartless and insensitive tyrant! From what I saw (I couldn't get through more than even half of this movie) there was not been one single character in this production that I liked. Maybe if the cast had been honing their acting skills by doing these performances in front of a live audience for a year or two before televising it, it would have worked for a live TV airing. But that wasn't the case, and all the characters were really fake and rehearsed. NONE of their dialogues sounded effortless, like they were saying those lines naturally as part of their normal conversation, but rather like it's like something they'd practiced beforehand and/or are being forced to say!If that's not bad enough, the producers changed around the order/placement of the song sequences in this movie, in the most ludicrous ways. For example, they moved the ""My Favorite Things"" song (which in the original movie, that Maria sings/teaches the von Trapp children during the thunderstorm scene) and putting it in the scene where Maria is in the Mother Abbess's office! The last straw for me, was when Maria and the Mother Abbess were singing the song together and the Mother Abbess is sitting on her desk, dangling her legs back & forth like she is a kid riding a swing! RIDICULOUS! What is she like 5 years old?? *smh*The Sound of Music Live!is a disgrace to the classic original with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews! I just wish I had never seen this movie in the first place, and I hope this crap doesn't end up sullying my memories of the original movie! I regret that I have wasted time on this garbage, when there were so many other nicer things I could have seen instead :(All in all, IMHO this movie has been horrible IN EVERY WAY, and I will never buy it on DVD!!!!",The Sound of Music Live!

Not that scary, IMO, although I did enjoy the action and macabre of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL back when I was 16 (haven't re-watched it recently, I don't remember it well enough to know what I'd think of it if I saw it again).  They try to incorporate drama-esque elements in the storytelling, bits of character development and the actors do give it their all, which gives the film a more down to earth and believable feel, but the story was too thin and what little story there was didn't get the attention it deserves.  The focus of the film was the supernatural build-up that made it obvious to the household that the place was haunted.  The paranormal investigating itself takes less than half the film, and prior to then it just seems like 1979's THE AMITYVILLE HORROR in HD.IT's not a bad film, I just was very underwhelmed after the anticipation surrounding the film's release date.

Ditto for Sigourney Weaver, although she does hang around until the end of the show, she pops in and out as needed, trying to look and act convincing as a stone-cold spy mistress.  She gives a ridiculous performance.Otherwise, no-talent actors, uninteresting plot, and a couple obligatory car chases, probably filmed only for the purpose of making the trailer.  Made on the cheap in Spain.________________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.",N/A

1611426,"Awhile ago, I watched ""The Last Exorcism.""  Today, I watched ""The Last, Last Exorcism,"" or was that ""The Last Exorcism Part 2""?  But I really think they're lying; without giving anything away, the ending in this follow up strongly suggests ""The Last, Last, Last Exorcism, and I Really, Really Mean it This Time!""  Don't know how they're going to fit that title on the Marguee, though.This film is actually fairly original, if you wave your hands a bit on the films that it stole, err, ""borrowed"" from:  ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Exorcist 2:  The Heretic"" (and you'd have to be a heretic to like that dog), ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" (this one's a little hazy to me since I saw it so long ago though), ""The Believers"" (once again, hazy), and, believe it or not, and yes last but not least -- and I really mean it this time -- ""Carrie.""  Well, maybe it's not exactly completely original I guess.This film is set in New Orleans, which I thought was a good idea.  After all, there's lots of witchcraft there, and there's lots of Voodoo there as well.  We all know that Voodoo is bad now, mmkay?  'Cause Voodoo means that you really dislike somebody and want to do bad things to him or her.  And that's just not right.  But Ashley Bell, who returns as Nell -- she was quite terrific in the first movie and is quite good here as well -- doesn't want to do bad things to other people; she really doesn't.  But she just can't quite help herself.  Why?  Well, I think that that question leads us to a possible theme. . . .""A tiger never changes her stripes.""  Oh, and perhaps, ""The past will come back to haunt you whether you like it or not.""  That latter idea seems to be the major theme, while the former could be a minor theme.  But they seem to stick with these themes for the entirety of the film, and I think that that was a smart move; a film with a strong theme is always a good idea.But unfortunately, I can't quite say that this is exactly a strong film.  I did like it a bit, and I did jump out of my seat quite a few times.  It's probably really a 3.5, but I decided to round down today -- not because I want to do bad things to this film, cause that just wouldn't be right -- but rather because I think that it ""borrowed"" from a few too many other films and therefore lost some originality.",N/A

416464,"PLEASE NOTE:  This review contains EXTREME spoilers.  If you have not seen this movie and do not want to know what it is about, don't read this!!!  You have been warned.In the slew of high school movies made in the 80s, three rise above the pack as classics:  ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"";  ""Better Off Dead"" with John Cusack;  and ""Heathers.""  I am roughly the same age as most of the stars of these flicks (Matthew Broderick, John Cusack and Christian Slater are all, like me, children of the 1960s; while the female lead of ""Heathers"" was slightly older, from 1971).  By the end of the 80s I was fed up to the back teeth with teen movies and missed all three of these superlatives on their first run.  In fact, I came to ""Ferris"" twenty-five years after it hit the theaters, ""Better Off Dead"" more than a quarter-century after it was made, and ""Heathers"" (last but not necessarily least) at only slightly less than that (it came out in 1989 and I saw it first in 2013).My unfamiliarity with these movies was a terrible strain to lots of my friends in the 1990s.  I was running with a younger crowd and they were always talking about ""Ferris"" and, even more, about ""Heathers.""  In fact, one friend had what amounted to an obsession with it.  And I, their best friend, never picked up on any of their references.All three movies hold up well, but all are problematic.  ""Better Off"" -- about a young man (Cusack) who tries unsuccessfully to kill himself after his girlfriend breaks up with him -- is arguably the funniest movie of the bunch, though its wackiness fades in the big ski contest at the end.  ""Ferris"" is, for the most part, exactly what it purports to be:  viz, a feel-good movie about a boy who plays hookey.  It loses its compass in the beginning of the final act, but finds its way back on track in the final chase sequence.Like the other two, ""Heathers"" is a comedy, but it belongs in a different class.  It's about three girls in a high school clique, all of whom are named Heather;  and a fourth girl, Veronica, who has only recently been catapulted to their stratospheric levels.  The Heathers (and Veronica, Winona Ryder) are the cool girls, but they have a penchant for wicked practical jokes.  Veronica is having a few qualms of conscience, but she doesn't know how to deal with the problem other than by making vicious (and hilarious) entries in her diary.Enter J.D. (Christian Slater), a new boy in school, who knows how to pay wicked little girls back.  In the dark comedy that follows Veronica and J.D. start murdering Heathers.  And Jocks.  And just about anyone else they don't like.Where Heathers fails is that is doesn't go far enough.  EXTREME SPOILER.  In ""Heathers"" best scene, Veronica, feeling pangs of guilt, pushes a hot car cigarette lighter into her hand, and J.D. lights a smoke from her red-hot palm.  It's too bad the movie did not retain that attitude for the rest of the picture.It starts to go wrong -- remember, here there be spoilers -- when, at the funeral of one of  their victims (well, two) Veronica and J.D. start laughing.  A little girl with a sad face looks back at Veronica, and the horror of what they are doing begins to impress itself on Veronica's psyche.  In a dark comedy, death should be unapologetic.  But after this Veronica begins to pit herself against J.D.  And then J.D.'s character goes wrong and he launches into the old canard about how no one ever loved him.  Boo-hoo.After Veronica tries to stop any more murders the movie lurches off in the direction of a slasher film and it never finds its sea legs again.  It has one last superb moment EXTREME SPOILER (where Veronica, who missed an entire jock with a handgun before, is now such a good shot she's able to shoot off a single finger), but by that time the flick is moribund.Though it calls itself ""Heathers"" and poses as a murderous romp where the Heathers are all set up as excellent targets for homicide, Veronica and J.D. leave some of the Heathers alive at the end.So, ""Ferris Bueller"" is a success because it wants to be a feel-good movie and ends up that way despite a bit of bewilderment near the end;  but while ""Heathers"" starts out as wickedly funny dark comedy it almost become a message movie.  Too bad.And I hope that while I have remained tidily childless, all the friends I used to run around with, who were obsessed with how great ""Heathers"" was, now have kids nearing high school age.  That's the great thing about irony.  It's so ironic.",Heathers VHS

227571,"Where ALIEN was sci/fi horror, James Cameron takes us into new territory by going the action/thriller route yet still remains respectful and faithful to all that was established in the previous film.  ALIENS in a perfect example of how a sequel should be made.  This movie has it all, top notch special effects, a thrilling story that never lets up once it kicks into high gear, and beautifully fleshed out cast of characters.Fifty seven years after her horrible ordeal in ALIEN, Ellen Ripley is rescued from deep cryo-sleep by a salvage crew and sent back to a station near Earths orbit.  She is grilled by company brass for the loss of her crew and ship from the previous film and demoted from her flight officer status.  Ripley soon learns that a colony has been established on the planet where the alien creature that killed her crew came from.  Soon contact is lost with the colony and the company wants Ripley to go in with a military team to check on the operation.  When Ripley and the marines arrive they discover that the colony is missing and that there are not one, but a whole nest full of alien creatures.  The might and firepower of the marines is outmatched by the resourceful aliens.  Ripley and a handful of survivors must struggle to survive and wipe out the alien onslaught before they can return to Earth.If you are a fan of ALIEN then you will love ALIENS.  It is every bit as good as the original which is rare for a sequel.  Sadly this is the last decent film in the franchise.  ALIEN 3 and 4 just don't measure up and should never have been made.  I wish James Cameron would revisit this franchise and set things right with a proper follow up to ALIENS.",N/A
1198608,"This movie is all about France and Frenchmen - painstakingly reconstituted. Titles are in impeccable French . Why on Earth did they stop short of  providing a french language track ?Well, maybe they did not want the French to see that movie - and die apoplectic.This is History rewritten in Japanese-horror style, replete with ghostly possession, talking skulls,zombies, deadly ""psalms"" and magical spells. The French knights give Louis XV the samurai salute . Treasons are intricate, and most everybody ends up murdered at least once (or more after being resurrected).

1588621,"A fun movie and a consistent extension as a sequel.  I am particularly impressed with the movie's treatment of technology in the timeline of the Star Trek genre given that this is definitely a prequel; The Enterprise looks more like a Rube Goldberg plumbing project than an interstellar starship.  But I applaud the boldness of the movie writers to properly 'date' the technology with all its potential foibles and flaws.The acting was good and I was particularly pleased to see Uhura take a more commanding lead.  Captain Kirk was given wide birth to deliver his role but the other 'legacy' roles of Spock, Scotty, and Bones seemed slightly limited to a thin scope of persona determined by predecessor roles and stories.Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that action-scene begat action-scene begat action-scene in this movie, it was a good time and I enjoyed the development of the Star Trek genre in its own timeline.",Star Trek Into Darkness

1496199,"Imagine my surprise when out of the blue this past weekend this movie appeared at the local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, even though this movie is two years old and I think already available on DVD. I had heard about this movie, and the premise of the movie was such that I gave in and went to see it.""Starbuck"" (2011 release from Quebec; 110 min.) brings the story of David (played by Patrick Huard), who in the late 80s made frequent donations to the local sperm bank (why? because he needed the money! Starbuck? his alias at the sperm bank!) and now 20+ years later learns from the sperm bank's lawyer that his sperm was used on many occasions, resulting in no less than 533 biological kids (!), and that 142 of them now have filed a class action law suit to find out the identity of their biological father. As it is, Davis is a good-for-nothing who slacks on the job (at his father's butcher shop) and not very nice to his girlfriend (whom we learn has just become pregnant). David gets a package with the profiles of the 142 kids in the class action, and he secretly starts out to observe them (without revealing his identity). They are in all walks of life: a pool lifeguard, a bartender, a foot manucurist, a guitarist playing in the subway for money and even a handicapped young man. Then one day one of the 142 has pieced things together and confronts David, threatening to ""out"" him. At this point we are about half-way into the movie. Will David's identity be revealed to these kids? Will he tell his girlfriend about his situation? To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: the first half of the movie is outright funny, as David is put in impossible situations and we see him trying to adjust as best he can. When he is first confronted by the lawyer with the facts, he keeps repeating ""yo no soy David Wosniak, yo no soy David Wosniak"", as if that will make the situation go away! When one of David's friends feels empathy for his situation, his friend claims ""you're experiencing post-partum depression, times 533"", haha! And on and on. But as the movie rolls into the second half, David starts, and hence we start, to comprehend the graveness of his situation. This man has 533 kids! with one more on the way! There are some serious undertones in the movie that make us reflect on what it means to be a parent, whether to one kids or to 533 kids. Kuods to writer-director Ken Scott who brings the script with a certain zaniness and craziness without ever going crossing the line into rudeness. And what can you say about the Quebecois-French accents, I just love it.The mere subject matter of the movie was bound to create a buzz. That, coupled with the fact that this is actually a good quirky little movie, was bound to garner attention in Hollywood, and so it is that this movie will get the Holywood remake, with Vince Vaughn cast in the title role. I'm not holding my breath, to be honest. Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a funny movie with some serious undertones, I can readily recommend ""Starbuck"".",N/A

Nicolas Cage, Francis Ford Coppola's nephew, is a great actor; and I like the fact that I didn't even know he was a Coppola until years after I'd seen him for the first time in &#34;Raising Arizona&#34;. I've been a Cage fan ever since. He is a typical &#34;white bread&#34; actor with fantastic skills who goes from the highest to the lowest in his roles with that kind of flexibility, and I've only seen him in a couple of roles I didn't like. Besides that, Don Cheadle and Tea Leoni were perfect assistants to his lead role and Cage carried the story well. I got it, but I cringe with the racial stereotypes in it -- from Cheadle to the night security guard who was so subservient and molly-coddling instead of getting his &#34;$4000 and a $400 bottle of Irish Scotch,&#34; or whatever.

1622371,"My family has enjoyed the previous Lego movie releases for Star Wars, but considering the superhero obsession in our household I had to pick this film up.  The movie itself runs 71 minutes, almost a feature length which is quite a bit more than we've gotten with the previous Star Wars specials.  The movie begins with Batman and Superman taking on Lex Luthor and flashes back to the ""Man of the Year"" award ceremony which quickly gets out of control when the Joker leads a group of villains (including the Penquin, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Two-Face and Catwoman) to crash the party.  And what better way to stop a villain team up then by getting together a few ""super"" friends like Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Cyborg and The Flash.  There are plenty of other characters that show up along the way as well.While this film utilizes the spirit of the cut-scenes fromLEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, it is not a straight repackage of them.  Many scenes have been added and the others reanimated and re-cut and improved upon for the release, all for the better.  If you've played the game, you get the gist, but this is a much higher quality of animation and gives you the story in a much more cinematic way.The film itself is fun for all ages, with enough Lego humor for the kids and plenty of jokes that will probably be over their heads including references to the Batman films going all the way back to the 1960s.  Kudos to the design team for their parody of the original 1989 Batman film opening, as well as the use of that iconic Danny Elfman music and the John Williams Superman score. The voice work is solid and though I prefer the voice cast of Arkham Asylum, this group of actors does a wonderful job portraying these characters in a more kid friendly way.The bonus features are great as well and include a short feature called ""Building Batman"" behinds the scenes in the Lego animation studio with a few kids getting to work with the resident animator, 2 episodes of The Brave and the Bold and one from Teen Titans, a Lego Batman stop-motion short, and 5 winning shorts from the Lego DC Universe Super Heroes Video Contest.  There are various languages options but unfortunately no commentary which I would have loved to hear from the director or lead animator about the production.

Obviously, the days of Platoon, NBK, and JFK are a distant, quickly fading, memory.  It is as if he felt obligated to finish a once promising project he lost interest in.  Brolin makes a good Bush and Wright does well as Powell but the rest are just poorly cast public image caricatures best suited for SNL.  The movie is surprisingly lighthearted, even mildly sympathetic in portraying a bunch of people who used a national tragedy and nonexistent evidence of wmds as an excuse to invade the wrong country.  War crimes.  Treason.  Bush and his camp, besides Powell, were arrogant, insular C+ students steeped in simplistic Manichean world views.  The world is suffering for their crimes of incompetence.  Bush isn't stupid, just weak, directionless, desperate to be liked, approved of by his father and, thus, prone to being bullied and condescended to.  Brolin portrays this excellently.  I think Bush really did believe there were wmds and was shocked and angered to realize he'd been the unwitting participant in a massive dupe.  How sad.  How sad for the world.",W

569169,"I saw this on network TV, was utterly charmed and moved by it, and immediately ordered the DVD.  I have no doubt it will stand up to the ""repeated viewing"" test.  The range of looks on Fluke's face is simply incredible, what a beautiful dog, a seeming old soul.  In all of Fluke's scenes you'd swear he's a sentient being, there's no hint of a trainer anywhere in the vicinity (also the case with other animals, e.g., dogs, a chimp, a squirrel, all behave and interact totally naturally, as though no cameras or people are present, just phenomenal).This movie is all about love of family, righting wrongs, and redemption.  It's profoundly moving and yet subtly so, not sentimental, saccharine or maudlin, dealing with death in an honorable way, neither trivializing it nor exploiting it.  I'm a big fan of films (so few and far between) that handle death gracefully, with dignity, and in a way that enriches us, delivers closure.  The movie works its magic on you below the surface, you won't see the tears coming.  And, there are a couple of surprising twists and a happy, perhaps slightly hokey but eminently satisfying ending.Personally, I think this film suitable for any child old enough to know that people die.  Other reviewers think not, though, so you might want to view it first to gauge its appropriateness for your own children.  Animal control officers are depicted as the bad guys (from the animals' point of view), which will warrant a talk with your kids about such matters.If you're an animal lover, I say buy this movie, you will LOVE it!And BTW, if you do, you may also like:The Story of the Weeping Camel...a joyful semi-documentary filmed by a native woman about her people, who love their animals, their environment, and each other, one of my favorite films ever.",N/A

1276560,"When it comes right down to it, Bewitched is truly a tale of two Dicks. Dick Sargent and Dick York. Ultimately the viewer must choose which Dick he or she prefers, as Darren. Its obvious from watching this series that Elizabeth Montgomery (Samantha) enjoyed working with both Dicks, and was very good at stroking thier huge egos. In this I agree with the expert, Franky Murillo. Its obvious she really worked hard at getting both Dicks to feel comfortable on the set so they wouldn't give any flaccid performances. She was able to handle both Dicks very skillfully, which helped the Series grow to its full potential. Its not an easy job to do, and its obvious she had her hands full at times. I think she preferred the first Dick over the second Dick, simply because he was bigger, in terms of stature. It would have been funny to have an episode in which both Dicks appeared at the same time, to see what kind of ramifications that would have brought. A double Dick episode you would have thought was a no brainer for this series, especially in Season 8. I think the viewer got shafted in not being able to see such an episode, but that's show biz I guess. Ultimately I found the second Dick a bit too stiff and lifeless in his role. Just didn't think he was penetrating enough to really make his mark. I thought the first Dick was much more animated and flexible in many ways, and when he got angry he turned real bright red. I have to hand it to both Dicks though, York and Sargent, they really exploded onto the sitcom scene back then, in roles that could have been embarrassing. Both Dicks really grew into their roles well, and inflated the value of the series, swelling the audience. While some of their antics were a little premature in terms of timing, both of them ultimately rose to the occasion in their own ways, and for that we fans of both wonderful Dicks are grateful.I have searched long and hard on the internet for this stuff, and its so gratifying to find these TV shows featuring both these Dicks in these Bewitched Box Sets!",N/A

202539,"This was a great movie,when I first saw it so many years ago, in the summer of 1983. I saw it in Vintage Faire Cinema, Modesto, CA.Admittedly, it is likely to be assumed that the sequel to such an iconic film would  be &#34;horrible.&#34; I've often wondered over the years, if such an attitude helped lead this movie to  better reviews. The old: expect  less, surprised by more...Also, it was this movie that introduced me to Jerry Goldsmith, famous composer, who wrote the Original Sound Track.  It was reported that after Anthony Perkins listened to this music, he actually wept, he enjoyed it that much. I would go on to listen to many more soundtracks by this composer.The Blu Ray transfer is better than I expected, but I honestly thought it was a little dark, and washed out.  The special features were good, but I was very confused by  the &#34;Audio Commentary&#34; by famous celebrities  attached to the  project, including several actors, and the producer (but alas, nothing from Alfred Hitchcock,  the director of the Original Psych.)  The movie starts, and on  a certain  audio track,you hear  a  volume come  up,and an introduction from an announcer...then you hear an audio interview  from each person,  several, throughout.There's no &#34;commentary&#34; on the scene you are watching; each celebrity is reintroduced, and  the words you hear him announce, are repetitive. It's very poorly done, in my opinion.

594398,"Yes, this movie has technical and script flaws but the action, fear factor and (Alice) Milla Jovovich make that all go away.  This is pure action/science fiction/horror with a capital ""E"" = escapism, excess, evil, and eye-popping.  It is beneath it all an amped-up zombie movie with an evil 'big brother' (The Umbrella Corporation)twist thrown in for good measure.  This film is more horror than the sequels.  This first film in a series sets one up for where this is heading, a futuristic world being manipulated by an evil conglomerate.  The plot is this, someone has released the T-virus in the underground labs of the Umbrella Corporation.  The only none survivors are Alice (Milla Jovovich)and Spence parks (James Purefoy), the 'married' security officers. A special rescue/security team (led by Colin Salmon and Michelle Rodriguez) takes them and a 'police officer'Matt Addison played by Eric Mabius with them into the underground Racoon City complex.  There, they must deal with the super computer, the 'Red Queen; (voiced by Sophie Vavsseur)- the daughter of the computer's inventor and designer, the former complex staff turned zombies by the T-virus , zombie doberman dogs and mutants.  Along the way, they discover betrayal, an eco-advocacy/terrorism plot and corporate greed. In the lead role of Alice, Ms. Jovovich shines as the initially confused and drugged security officer who slowly realizes her role in this tragedy and is able to deal with the evil that exists all around her.  She comes out the hero but is soon at the mercy of the Umbrella Corporation which designates her as ''Project' Alice and the other survivor, Matt Addison as Project 'Nemesis.'",N/A

859197,"This is the second of great silent SF movies made by Fritz Lang and although not as immensely great and universaly known as ""Metropolis"", it is certainly a very major film! Below, you will find some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.""Frau im Mond"" begins with the great dream of a manned expedition to the Moon shared by two unlikely friends. One of them, professor Georg Mannfeldt (Klaus Pohl), is an old scientist, considered by his pairs as a madman or a fraud and living in most abject poverty. The second, Wolf Helius (Willy Fritsch), is a gifted engineer and very succesful businessman, owner of a major industrial company. Together they decide to build a giant rocket and go to the Moon, looking for gold which they hope will cover the immense cost of this enterprise. This is described in the very beginning of the film. The performance of Klaus Pohl as an old half-mad scientist is absolutely unique - those first minutes of the film, you really WANT to see them!What happens next? Well, quite a lot indeed, because this is a long film. Some sinister forces will intervene, acting through The Man, a nameless archi-villain played magistrally by actor Fritz Rasp, who with his unique physionomy and great talent steals absolutely every scene he appears in (he also played a quite sinister character in ""Metropolis""). As the title clearly suggests, a young woman will also play a considerable role - this is in fact one of the first films in which a woman who is also a serious scientist appears... There will be a love triangle, lots of trouble during the space trip, more trouble on the Moon and a very good, VERY surprising ending. All of this under the curious but stoic regard of a very zen mouse, played by Die Maus Josephine (as stated in the credits)...)))This is a long film, but I didn't feel the time passing. The performance of actors is absolutely brilliant! The unique character of talent needed to act in silent movies gives to this film a charm impossible to find in modern cinema. Passion, hope, love, despair, anger, cruelty, lust, terror, disgust, ecstasy - you name it, they are all here, silently screaming at us from the screen. The plot is not bad at all, especially considering that this film is a pioneering work. Description of space travel is of course deliciously silly, but that also gives this film a very unique savour.This film is also the first one to show the countdown to the launch of a rocket - pretty impressive, considering that this film was made in 1929. The very solemn moment of launching of the rocket is a great and very emotional cinema scene - and it certainly greatly impressed and inspired many young students, who were later to become rocket scientists in German V-1 and V-2 program in Peenemunde, beginning with a certain Werner von Braun, who saw this film, eyes wide-open, at the tender age of 17. In fact, the first V-2 rocket ever launched had the image of ""Frau im Mond"" painted on it...I loved this film greatly and I am absolutely keeping preciously this DVD. I recommend it with all my heart. Enjoy!",Woman in the Moon

361798,"I own a lot of exercise videos, in VHS and DVD formats, and I perhaps utilize them in a way that not everyone does -- I initially watch them to simply see whether there is anything -- and even if it's one exercise, idea, technique, sequencing, or piece of advice -- that is different or otherwise useful in a way that appeals to me, and subsequently expands my 'repertoire', or results in my modifying (or replacing) an existing method, etc. -- if even one such thing is associated with my 'introduction' to a given video, then I consider it to have been of benefit.Not surprisingly, many videos involve exercises that are common to many other videos, and thus for some fitness videos, I might see nothing that truly stands out or is in any way different from what I've seen elsewhere.Additionally, I do not subscribe to the thinking that seems prevalent in many realms, and involves 'newer' somehow being equated with 'better' -- I'm aware that there are many 'oldies but goodies', and can look past the associated (and usually not-so-appealing) music, outfits, and era-specific hairstyles -- it doesn't affect my motivation, and the importance of the 'what' and 'how' contained within trump any seemingly 'cosmetic' aspects.I'd heard of the 'Buns of Steel' video many years ago, and found myself curious as to why it had become famous -- and especially wondered whether its popularity was due to anything 'special' about the production.  Well, not long into viewing a VHS version of the original 'Buns of Steel', I definitely 'took notice' -- this was not anything like the various forms of 'fluff' I'd seen in miscellaneous 1980s fitness videos -- no, the original 'Buns of Steel' production can and does still 'hold its own', exercise quality-wise, when compared to so many other fitness videos.In viewing this the first time, I was also surprised by how it wasn't just one, or even 'just a few' things that I took note of, and could tell would be effective in 'working' the relevant region (and in a way that was 'friendly' to my knees) -- the whole darn production stands out -- it was one 'yes' after another, when it came to my 'flagging' the different exercises for my use... I was and am impressed -- the exercises utilized in this video are still embraced by many of us today because they work, and I haven't found (and don't expect to find) a true 'replacement' video for this 'routine' (that being said, aspects of some of the exercises would now be considered more representative of certain 'specialties' within the fitness genre (with some Lotte Berk, Bar Method, and Ballet Beautiful -esque aspects found in the video -- which, to an extent, could potentially be interpreted as this video having been somewhat 'ahead of its time', though all in all, it is simply a terrific combination of well-chosen and effective exercises, and ones which were selected for targetting development of a specific region of the body).If I had to choose from among my (many) exercise videos, and create a kind of Top Ten list, this video would be among them -- I don't care about the 'when' of its creation, as it's the quality of exercise selection (and associated effectiveness), and the overall usefulness value, that matter most to me.",The Original Buns of Steel VHS
242952,"I first had the pleasure of seeing this movie when I was in the fourth grade. At the time I didn't really know what &#34;black comedy&#34; was-my 9 year old mind couldn't comprehend how one could make a comedy out of murdering someone. But I immediately identified with Billy Crystal as the frustrated writer, Larry. Even at 9 I knew that I was going to write for a living one day, and his struggles to get something, ANYTHING, down on paper were quite palpable to me. Combined with his ex-wife's phenomenal success in the same field, and his having to take a survival job of teaching creative writing at a local community college, you already have the makings of an Everyman a la Hitchcock (the only Hitchcock film I had seen at this point was &#34;Psycho&#34; so I didn't get the &#34;Strangers On A Train&#34; connection). It is in this writing course that he meets Owen, played to meek perfection by Danny DeVito. Owen is oppressed by his domineering, ogre of a mother, Anne Ramsey. Owen entices Larry to a screening of Hitchcock's underrated masterpiece &#34;Strangers On A Train.&#34; After the film both men discuss the miserable state of their lives and come to the conclusion that the source of their problems are two women:Larry's ex, Owen's mother. Owen suggests that Larry murder his mom, in exchange for him murdering Larry's ex, &#34;Criss cross.&#34; Larry dismisses the idea, but when his ex turns up missing, he is convinced that Owen has committed the crime and he is now obligated to kill Owen's mother. This is accomplished in a series of Rube Goldberg-inspired events, each one hilariously topping the last, none of which actually kill Mother. Again I hadn't been exposed to this type of humor before so I found it highly comical and clever. Later when I grew into adulthood I viewed this film again and found it even MORE witty-this is an adult comedy after all. Danny DeVito as the director is able to find all kinds of comedic nuances, from Mr. Crystal sitting at his typewriter trying to find the perfect adjective to describe the night, to the ending where they literally try to throw  momma from the train. Even the cartoon-like ways that they try to kill mother come off as witty rather than silly. He is also able to suppress his usually manic obnoxiousness and let Mr. Crystal's neurosis lead the story. Although this is not my favorite Danny DeVito directed film, it is one of his most fun and amusing.",N/A

For a programmer (B or second level, budget conscious, film) it comes off as one worth watching (if your are not expecting 70 million  dollar pyrotechnics). The acting is acceptable, the Magic spells pretty much what we were accustomed to in the ""olden"" days, and the story a bit naive but bearable. (While I am not a Harvard graduate, I tend to the notion that their Anthropology doctorates are required to have just a bit more common sense and savvy about the realities of politics than is possessed by  the Pullman character.) Naturally, any viewer of a voodoo picture has, by assumption, bought in to the notion that there are walking dead and that a steel spike driven through the scrotum in a torture chamber is something you will get over in a day or so, and the repetition of which doesn't make you think twice about your future.I can't speak as a devotee of such films as these, but to others who are taking an occasional look-in as I do, this is a pretty good choice for the bottom part of a double feature.",Serpent & the Rainbow VHS

950749,"I'm a big George Michael fan and he mentioned liking this series when interviewed after getting out of hospital post-pnemonia (sp?), so I checked it out from the library to have a look.  All the actresses/actors were good; I give it one star because the lead character ran so roughshod over everyone around her and no one checked her, which I found unbelievable.  Yes she owned her own salon so I can understand her employees having to put up with her, and yes I can accept that she chose a husband she could walk all over, but every single other character she interacted with took her guff, in as many episodes as I could stand to watch (couldn't get through all of them), with very little to no complaint.  Even her customers were abused.  What successful small business owner would be such a dolt that she would run roughshod over her own customers; how could she stay in business.  Obviously she couldn't.  And she lived in a small village, not London, so word of mouth about her would quickly get around town, and she'd have no customers and therefore no business.  I understand that in real life, often out of politeness, people will not contradict an overbearing stranger, but the lead treated every single other character abominably and she got away with it every time (again wasn't interested enough in her to watch all the episodes). As the lead character isn't rich, famous or especially beautiful (not a knock at the lead, who is attractive, just obvious she isn't playing a high-end star) in the story, no reason for anyone but her employees, and possibly her husband, to put up with her.  One star due to unbelievable character interactions.  Lead actress was good, I thought she had a good time with the part.  If characters behave unbelievably in a story, how is the audience supposed to care about them.  The lead character was believable as a self-obsessed bully, but the surrounding characters were not believable in the way they reacted to her (except, as previously noted, her employees/husband).  Poorly written secondary characters.  Plus lead character was one note, didn't flush her out.  She started out obnoxious and stayed that way throughout (witnessed same behavior in final episode).  Most people in the audience don't know how a beauty salon is run, but every single person is an expert on human behavior/interaction (because we've been interacting with others since birth) and when an especially unbelievable character interaction is featured in a story, it makes it harder for audience to suspend disbelief, I think is the literary phrase.  Ugh, is my phrase.  As a woman, I want more roles featuring women, but if characters don't interact in a recognizable (i.e., human) way, then a story/series featuring a woman is unengaging.  I want more women's roles, but in quality, well-written projects.  I understand the lead actress wrote this, and it's been off awhile now, so she's probably gotten better.  I look forward to seeing more of her work and seeing her progression/improvement.  She's obviously talented; she can write a lead who gets the audience's attention, just needs to create a fictitious world in which her lead ""lives.""",Nighty Night - The Complete Series 1

1631619,"[I bought the combo and here is my review]I really hesitate to call this totally original film a franchise. James Wan creates a film that is a superb experience in the cinema, and is brilliant on the Blu-ray delivery in all respects. Thankfully, it is not a sequel in the traditional sense, and delivers the scares with both barrels. I would expect that you probably know the story by now, if not, you should see INSIDIOUS first and then come back to INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2. This film starts with scares right from the beginning, and takes you on a tremendous roller coaster ride with the original cast.The extras on Blu-ray are brilliant again. The work in progress: onset Q&A; deals with story issues and last 23 minutes. Peripheral vision: behind-the-scenes is a great bonus and last 15 minutes. Insidious: spectral sightings are supposed to be web-i-sodes, which I hope is self-explanatory, but if you have not seen it this is next level freaky, even from the point of view of INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2, mainly because it is so intense and in a few short minutes Lynn Shaye delivers more of a power packed punch than she does in the main film. I think that if you enjoy insidious chapter 2, then insidious spectral sightings is going to be something you love. The extra HAUNTED HOSPITAL: ON LOCATION is kind of so-so but one item in it may give you a spine tingling fright. GHOSTLY TRANSFORMATIONS is about the makeup and is intriguing but would've been better in a wider documentary. Leigh Whannell's Journal is actually quite enjoyable but at eight minutes it is way too short. Overall, whilst I would've liked a commentary in the bonus, I think that what we have at the moment is pretty fun. I hope you enjoy this roller coaster ride as much as I did, or even more; I know I'll be watching it a few more times the volume up and the lights turned down... Pleasant dreams.********************************************************I rarely write a review of the films before the DVD or Blu-ray is out. I had no expectations of what the sequel would bring to the party. After seeing the promo I was won over. Anyone who has seen the promo/s will have an idea of what I mean. The one thing I do agree on is that any comment on this story would give away too much, but not to mention by word-of-mouth that this is a great supernatural horror film would be a disservice. As many horror films as I have seen,I sometimes think I am a little jaded, or even more accepting of the spook type of films. Lucky for me I had about 15 young people sitting in the row behind me, and every time I got spooked, they screemed or more, and this was a good barometer. For a truly scary film this one touches all bases, and if James Wan is leaving horror, then that is a big loss to supernatural horror. If you have ever walked through an old house late at night which you thought was haunted and felt the chills, then this film is for you. Even if you have ever seen what you thought was a ghost, or just a shadow casting a weird caul across your eyes, then this film is for you. Forget what people with negative comments have said, this film checks all the boxes... Pleasant dreams.",N/A

And this is exactly what Dick Proenneke accomplished.As is so often the case, this sequel is not quite as good as the first chapter which is an extremely tough act to follow. But it is still immensley enjoyable and I would also highly recommend the two accompanying books that really fill out this incredible journey.

1147219,"Yusef regains his sight (lost at age 8 after an accident with fireworks) at age 45 and discovers the world in which he was comfortable and cared for is no longer enough for him. The other reviews allude to the political metaphors with which one is faced whenever dealing with Iran. Majidi's beautiful vistas from The Color of Paradise and the Children of Heaven are not presented here, but are replaced by images that convey the fears and longings of a middle aged man suddenly awakened to a wide world. Yusef becomes aware of a pretty young student as well as the plainness of his motherly wife had been his caretaker all those years. There is some obvious filmic sympolism here, particularly when the wife ensures Yusef can find his wedding ring after he drops it on the floor while still bind. The problem is that she cannot do the same when he no longer needs her to function. Political loyalty works the same way, but any references to this are very subtle.Throughout the film, Yusef moves with the walk of a blind man, placing his feet down instead of sweeping ahead as he plods forward. Like contemporary Iran, he was formed as a blind man and cannot cope with a world with all the distractions of sight. As the tragedy of his situation dawns on the viewer, there is a sudden twist that either amplifies the tragedy or resolves it, left for the viewer to decide. This is a very thoughtful film and probably a great political parable (see Saramago's novel Blindness for more of that), but I missed the beauty of Majidi's earlier masterpieces.","Willow Tree, The"

1588918,"The Short: Featuring a strong and incredibly dynamic cast that is both well acted and written, a grandeur of delicious special effects and an incredible sense of pacing to match the first, JJ Abrams returns with ""Into Darkness"" only to (nearly) out-do himself.9.25/10Ah, the summer movie season. The time when we are blown away by grand demonstrations of digital artists, loud and booming explosions, and silly excuses for characters and story thrown into the mix. It's a summer movie clich&eacute;; one that is fun, yet unfulfilling. You could be easily skeptical of the sequel to one of 2009's best films, Star Trek, but have no fear...JJ Abrams is back in action.Into Darkness has come early in the summer movie season, but I'm sure it is going to be a favorite pick for most movie goers and also Trek fans. For me, it's definitely going to be one of the 2013 summer blockbusters to judge all others, simply because it does nearly everything right.Returning with a phenomenal cast, Into Darkness goes for a more character driven piece this time, which succeeds in almost every way. The whole cast, from Kirk to Spock (Pine and Quinto), Scotty to Chekov (Pegg and Yelchin), I could go on and on...the whole cast rocks. Dashes of great humor and stupendous writing are the strong points here, with each and every character having their shining ""moment."" Cumberbatch, our villain this time around, is also fantastic, featuring an intense and believable performance that doesn't feel clich&eacute; or silly. Above all else one of my favorites, Scotty, gets plenty of screen time and steals the show in nearly every scene. It's only some of the newer faces on the Enterprise are simply ""there"", but it's cool to see so many different characters get a chance in the limelight. The character driven story could've fallen apart, but gladly the characters are written even better this time around and are heroes you'll want to root for.The story of Into Darkness is nothing ""new"", but it's far from boring and dull. Featuring some interesting twists and incredible action set pieces, the story told is one that could've easily been rudimentary but is instead smart and exciting. While the plot of the original is a little ""thrown in there"", the plot here is more essential to the experience, it's just a little less original. There are a couple of plot holes, mainly when getting closer to the ending, but it doesn't distract...it simply (and sadly) mars an incredible experience.The visual effects wizards that Abrams commands are also back, with some incredibly delicious results. Ships look gorgeous, phasers and guns look vibrant and cool, and the action sequences are FANTASTIC. Abrams trademark style shines here too, with some sequences that are pretty simple but are shot in such fantastically cool ways that it's impossible not to be glued to your seat. There are also some simply gorgeous shots, from great use of rack focusing and quick zooms to create a sense of realism in even the most CGI enhanced scenes.The soundtrack (composed by the wonderful Michael Giacchino) is perfect. The theme is incredible, Khan's theme is excellent, and the booming percussion will get your blood pumping. The sound effects are loud and in your face, but you also never lose the intimacy of an important dialogue moment. It's edited to perfection (in theaters).It's only a couple of plot holes and the lack of ""freshness"" that made the original so incredible that keeps Into Darkness just shy of greatness. It's the characters and thrilling story that keeps you glued to your chair, which arguably is more important and thus makes Into Darkness the superior entry in the series.As for now, Into Darkness is a truly spectacular 2nd act for the Enterprise and crew, one that takes their relationships to the breaking point and truly tests both the cast and Abrams once again to return and try top themselves once again. Into Darkness doesn't boldly go where no film has gone before, but it is surely one of the most solid sequels that Hollywood has dished out in recent memory.But I'll stand by this: What a fantastic way to begin the summer movie season.9.25/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

There isn't much that is changed in a big way, except the unnecessary expansion of Arwen's character.  Tolkien's characters are designed to feel a love that goes beyond the body and hits right into the soul and that love is able to be felt between any two beings, no matter the gender or race (we, in our closed minded attitudes can't really handle a male dwarf and a male elf loving each other like that, so it had to be replaced with a sexy man and a beautiful female elf).  I have no real complaints with the movie, aside from that deviation from the book.  Everything in the movie is impeccably done and I truly feel something for every single character.

The earlier shows are black and white. The aspect ratio is 4:3, which was the format of the TV sets made in that era. The episodes have an average runtime of 22-23 minutes each.The DVD includes a nice sampling of the Lone Ranger series, from #14 (the first season) to #221 (the last season). Episode #221 is actually the last Lone Ranger episode made, and to my recollection, it's the only episode where the Lone Ranger removed his mask.I was practically mesmerized watching these old shows that I first watched on TV more than a half-century ago. No, the acting isn't that great, and the production values weren't nearly what they are for today's TV shows, but it's a marvelous look into the past at one of the earliest successful TV series. The Lone Ranger was the ABC Network's first hit series and helped to establish the network as one of the big three in TV.The DVD is a treasure trove for Lone Ranger fans, and well worth a look for anyone interested in the development of television shows, especially westerns.A review copy of the DVD was provided by the seller.",Lone Ranger - Who Was That Man

I really, really wanted to watch this movie because it marked the beginning streak of some number one hit movies starring Salman Khan in India and so I bought it! I was concerned that maybe I wouldn't like the story but I did. It was actually stunning to me in several places; it could rival a hard hitting Hollywood movie but without the foul language. It also had humor, romance, mystery, intrigue, and awesome song and dance numbers. I definitely recommend buying yourself a copy and watching over and over again.

1560707,"although the movie was pretty good it falls short of my expectations, as did Oblivion, however I though Oblivion was slightly better.It's a new type of movie where they are keeping budgets smaller with fewer actors involved and more pure CGI animation.  With Smith in the movie and a total cost of $130 million to make it most of the budget with to the programers no doubt.The movie was for the most part very predictable and the CGI imagery was very good.  Appeared that much of it was shot in the redwoods on the coast of california in the smith river area, very beautiful area.At the end it said story by Will Smith, it was a good movie as i said but just not what I was expecting.  This is smart money I would say for huge movies but screen plays are limited and harder to evolve with the lack of actors.As with the movie ""Buried"" with Ryan Reynolds, it's does a great job with what he had to work with but left many viewers expecting more, you will find the same with this movie.I somehow feel that big budget movies are evolving to this type of movie, not many actors and TONS of CGI.

1642576,"""Oz The Great And Powerful"" involves a con-man named  Oscar Diggs, who later becomes the Wizard of Oz (shrewdly played by James Franco). Oscar Diggs ends up in a scenic world after promising to do great things in his life, if allowed to live.  He ends up meeting three women who are all witches: The Wicked Witch of The West, The Wicked Witch Of The East, and Glinda The Good Witch. However two of them (brilliantly played by Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz) are powerful  but evil. The third witch, Glinda The Good (depicted in a fascinating way by Michele Williams), also projects magical energy but wields her talents for good.  I liked the heartfelt love story that developed between Glinda The Good Witch and Oscar Diggs (who becomes the Wizard Of Oz).  Zach Braff also makes a cameo in the film as Finley, a hardworking assistant to Oscar Diggs.

The image is crisp, colors are deep and beautiful, and the soundtrack is full and rich. If you're a fan of this musical, you owe it to yourself to get this version.For anyone who doesn't know, ""The Music Man"" was a Broadway show adapted to film. Robert Preston, who stared in the title role on stage, was included in the film at the insistence of the show's creator, Meredith Wilson. If I remember correctly, he wouldn't let the film go forward without the assurance that Robert Preston appear. There was a good reason for that, as the role of Harold Hill was Preston's signature role on stage or film. His charming and likable flimflam artist is one of the truly unforgettable performances in film history.Shirley Jones was a veteran performer in musicals by the time this film was made, having started out her career with Oklahoma and Carousel. Her pure voice is simply one of the best in the business, and her acting is always top notch as well.Ron Howard, at eight years old an experienced veteran of film and TV, had already appeared in the role of Opie on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" for two years by the time he made ""The Music Man"" and displays real emotion in his role of the troubled young boy sensitive about his lisp.The movie is charming, the music is fantastic, and the comedy will keep you laughing from start to finish.Highly recommended, especially in this blu ray presentation.",N/A

This controversial film is about no matter how well we know each other, there is still racial tension living right under the surface. All it takes is some pointless argument about a picture on the wall or a radio being played too loudly, for racism to rear it's ugly head on both sides. Then what happens? People are dead, businesses are ruined, and communities are rioting. Over what? The argument is but a mere spark, racism is the issue. Had the argument been between two black men, instead of a white man and a black man, things would have turned out much differently.

1414404,"Robert Redford's ""The Conspirator"" (2010) is about the only woman to be charged as a co-conspirator in Lincoln's assassination. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) ran the boarding house where her son, John (Johnny Simmons), regularly met with John Wilkes Booth and others plotting their seditious deeds. Mary Claims she simply ran a boarding house and didn't know what her tenants and their friends were hatching. The young lawyer assigned to defend her, Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), knows that she probably knew more, but also that there's not enough evidence to convict her and, by extension, execute her.The film starts with Lincoln's assassination and the search for Booth, but then settles into a courtroom drama. I found the first half engrossing enough for a historical drama, but it was the second half that really hooked me in when I discovered that ""The Conspirator"" wasn't just about the Surratt family. It's just as much about Aiken's determination to do what's right, whatever the cost, and the consequences of this decision.At only 27 years of age, I'm sure those who assigned Aiken the job of defending Mary Surratt weren't expecting much, especially since he fought for the North and despised the rebellion. He was a puppet expected to just go-through-the-motions of defending Surratt. But, as Aiken discovers that there's really not enough evidence to convict Mary and observes the outright corruption of the prosecution, Aiken understands that there's more than just Mary Surratt's life at stake. If she could be railroaded and executed so easily in the land of the free, anyone could.But there's a hefty price for doing what's right if it goes against the grain of popular opinion.Alexis Bledel also stars as Aiken's woman and Evan Rachel Wood as Mary's daughter, both excellent.The film was shot in Georgia and runs 122 minutes.FINAL SAY: ""The Conspirator"" does exactly what a good historical drama should do -- it takes the viewer back into the historical world of the characters and does it effectively and realistically. It also prompts you to look into the facts of the real-life events afterward. Even more, the potent subtexts are driven home.GRADE: B+",N/A

1500958,"Of the Oscar nominees I have seen, this one is the most entertaining although its also the least ambitious on account of the fact that its pretty much a suspense-thriller. The film is a highly fictionalized version of a real-life hostage rescue operation that allows Affleck to direct himself playing a hero. Its like a really good television drama like Raid on Entebbe (1976) but with slighly higher production values and an excellent soundtrack (Stones, Van Halen, Led Zep). I think it wants to be Dog Day Afternoon or All the Presidents Men but neither the characters nor any of their individual stories are particularly interesting, the gimmicky operation (a cheesy space epic with an Orientalist twist) is the star of the film. Affleck doesn't act so much as play straight man to zany John Goodman and zanier Alan Arkin (who really provide much of the entertainment value). The film succeeds at capturing the time period (by seamlessly joining historical and pseudo-historical footage of the actual revolution and storming of the embassy), and it succeeds in manufacturing just the right amount of suspense to keep viewers on the edge of their seats without wearing them out with too much political complication. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Lincoln. Its a perfectly competent film about a very outlandish CIA operation but it doesn't try to make any kind of comment on terrorism. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Zero Dark Thirty. Its the perfect film for people tired of politics and of thinking (if the film wins Best Pic on Sunday, its probably because thats the mood of the country right now). But if you want an even better film about terrorism in the Seventies, I'd recommend the award-winning HBO miniseries Carlos (Olivier Assayas, 2010).",Argo

1486974,"There is something about Quentin Tarantino that rubs me the wrong way. I keep watching his movies and I keep secretly hoping that I am not going to like them. So far, I have been consistently disappointed in that hope and, whatever my no doubt petty reasons are for harboring a mysterious grudge against the man, I have to admit, he makes pretty good movies. This movie was pretty good. Not as good asInglourious Basterds (Two-Disc Special Edition), in my opinion, but still pretty good. Quentin Tarantino is a good writer and, at the very least, his movies are always interesting, and there is never any cliche dialogue.The characters in the movie are, of course, very interesting. I believe Quentin Tarantino said in his Oscar acceptance speech that if his films are still remembered in a hundred years it will be for the characters he created. I think that is probably true. There are four characters that stand out in the movie. Calvin Candie as a detestable white plantation owner, and Stephen, his conniving African American servant, make excellent antagonists, and Dr. King Schultz and Django Freeman make excellent protagonists. Unfortunately, I felt like, of the four, Django was the least fleshed out. I would have liked to have seen more of his history (how did he get to be so good with a gun? how did he meet Broomhilda?). Broomhilda could have been fleshed out a bit more as well, but the acting was excellent all around.I also would have liked to have seen more humor in the movie. There is a scene fairly early on in the movie that was really hilarious, where a bunch of klansmen are out to get revenge on Dr. Schultz and Django, but they are all having trouble seeing out of the eye holes of their white sheets, and they have a long argument about what to do about it. I thought it was not only really funny, but a brilliant way to undercut the klan and make them look as ridiculous as they really are. The klan is usually portrayed as very menacing. I thought it was great to see them portrayed as a bunch of bumbling fools. Humor, I think, is often a much more powerful corrosive than anger. I wish there had been more scenes like that in the second half of the movie.SPOILER ALERT. I was not entirely satisfied with the revenge aspect of the film. I am not sure how long it actually was, but it felt like at least the last hour of the film or so (perhaps a bit less) was a long bloodbath of revenge. I find Quentin Tarantino's rewriting of history in an effort to provide a kind of catharsis very interesting, but I thought it was more effective in Inglorious Basterds. The crescendo scene in Inglorious Basterds is more condensed and it just felt more satisfying to me. I was waiting for that cathartic moment at the end of this film and I did not feel like I really got it.I think that the people who are complaining that this was not an accurate depiction of slavery are missing the point to some degree. There is still a lot of anger about slavery in this country, as there should be, and it is not just in the African American community. I am not African American, but I am still angry about our history of slavery. This movie works the way most movies work: it condenses all of the evil of slavery into a few characters, gets the audience angry, and then releases that anger in a crescendo of violence. I understand the intention, I just do not think it was as effective as it was in Inglorious Basterds.One other disappointment I had was with the Broomhilda legend. It does not seem to me to be a real legend but that is not what disappointed me. The legend is set up as if it is meant to be a prefiguration of what is going to happen. Broomhilda has been set up on a mountain top, guarded by a dragon, and surrounded by the fires of hell. Siegfried goes to get her and must slay the dragon and pass through the fires of hell. I do not feel like Tarantino did enough to cash out that prefiguration. Presumably, the dragon would be Candie, but his death was too quick and easy, and perhaps the fires of hell were meant to foreshadow the dynamite, but Django does not pass through those fires. I wish Tarantino had more clearly worked out the parallels in the two stories. It would not have had to be literal. I was not expecting Django to walk through actual fire. I just felt like it was a set up that was never totally paid off.All that having been said, it was still a very entertaining movie. Quentin Tarantino seems to me to make movies mostly for the fun of it. The issues this film deals with are serious issues (racism, slavery, etc.) but those issues seem like more of a set up for a fun revenge flick than a serious examination of serious themes. Which is fine. I admit that I always have fun watching a Quentin Tarantino movie. Maybe that is why I resent him so much.",Django Unchained

1586855,"Kettlebells became hot on the scene because you can burn twice as many calories, and work way more muscles than simply doing regular strength training or aerobic training alone. The reason is that the swings and movements create aerobic benefits and you use more muscles doing the moves than you would with ordinary strength training.But the best part of kettlebell workouts is that they are actually really fun, which is hard to say about most workouts. Swinging the bell around doesn't feel like the usual boring workout, it's actually a fun thing to do that just happens to work you out like crazy.Keep in mind that when doing a kettlebell, you are basically holding 2 dumbells. In fact, if you do lots of handweight training, you'll notice many moves are the same you'd do holding 2 handweights, but using the kettlebell makes them easier to hold. Because of this, using the weight of what your two dumbells would normally weigh, or a couple pounds less, usually finds the right weight for you. For example, if you are really out of shape and have never worked out, you might begin dumbell training with 2 two-pound weights, so you could use a 4 pound kettlebell. If you have some muscle tone you might use a 12 pound kettlebell etc.Better yet, many kettlebells now are adjustable so that you can start with a lower number and add more weight as you develop muscle definition.Now, on to the workout. Nicely done, and a very informed instructor. My main gripe is that it is assumed this will be the only workout you'll be using so you would start with the tutorial workout (a good workout in itself) and move up to the next levels. However, I workout by rotating several workouts (I have a library of over 100 workouts) and I've realized that the really well thought-out workouts incorporate the tutorials into the workout. For example, if you do a Jillian Michaels workout, she'll start a rep so that you know what you are doing, and while you are doing those reps she'll point out the tutorial part. This is better even if you do use the same workout again and again daily because, if you aren't doing the tutorial, you are reminded of proper form every time you do the workout, regardless of level. So I far prefer, regardless of who is working out, a workout that does not have a tutorial at the start and then other workouts, but one that has several workouts, all incorporating guidance as you DO the reps.But kettlebells are an interesting workout in that you can more easily do the moves incorrectly and a good trainer can make all the difference. This is a good trainer who really knows how to do the moves right. You'll avoid injury but more importantly, you'll get a fantastic workout that targets ALL of your body. This one DVD can get you in shape all over, in an enjoyable way of doing it. So I actually like the DVD and instruction and found it a great way to get in shape.",ULTIMATE KETTLEBELL WORKOUTS FOR BEGINNERS

Not to mention abevy of superb, brave performances.This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways ofPaul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"".  Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn),but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters ashuman beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts.  These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality,without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worldsaround them.  You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them,(spoiler ahead!)Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic.  Yes Renton is walkingaway from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive aboutmoney, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs.  To me, that's what the whole, chillingly`choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about.  Truly `choosing life' is about a lot more than justsaying `no' to drugs.Not to mention the title `Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnectedhobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by.  Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turningaway from living life just the same.",Trainspotting VHS

Besides the director's genius for creating tension, moody music, meaningful dialogue, and so forth, not just one but two people steal the show here and when sharing scenes together...nothing else matters period. I'm talking about the cool death row antihero and the lethal secretary. One of the best stories ever for an action film, a gang goes kamikaze against the near empty precinct for previously gunning down some members. Carpenter doesn't let up and there is always something happening especially when you see how characters handle being thrust into a life and death situation. My favorite scene is during the first attack when all the men are busy shooting bad guys the secretary is sent in to release 2 convicts from holding cells and even though shot, she takes out a gang member hand to hand. In my book this is the coolest woman ever in movies. The rest of the film she is nearly silent because she is too busy walking the walk, while remaining feminine. You want to know about her but she is a total mystery and this is why the movie is so brilliant and works. Lots of bloody action, high drama, and two people making one significant presence that won't be forgotten in the history of movies. 16x9 picture is great.",N/A

Another thing I find amusing is that it is nice to recognize a director who once was a great actor who few remember becoming and even better director than he was an actor, and thats a major compliment because his effort here is astonishing, considering all the factors. In this case its Richard Benjamin who serves up a beautiful story here about a wayward mother(Cher) raising two daughters on her own(Ricci and Ryder). Chers character is always wanting to take her two daughters away from their reasonable lives by moving to some other part of the country, seemingly trying to escape bad memories she cant ever truly escape. Winona Ryder, wonderful as ever, battles within her self between her lusts for a handsome young man and her own complicated and delusional commitment to God. And it torments her. Yet Benjamin tenderly showcases this torment in strangely hysterical ways. Its indeed also Ryders commentary that gives much of the film its comedic flow, and its truly brilliant to say the least. Christina Ricci in an early role puts the icing on the cake as a cute young girl whos passion is for swimming. Bob Hoskins is the perfect available man who is simply irresistable despite his rather squatty appearance. Its his cheerful and carefree personality that makes him likable. Though by the end of the film he might not exactly get his wish, the movie plays the story in the end pretty much they way real life can be.

I probably can't add all that much to the many one star reviews of this steaming pile of a movie, but it was, as usual , trotted out again over Memorial Day , to my disgust.The countless faults and flaws of this abysmal pile of crap have been noted many times already; it actually insults the intelligence of anyone who has some passing knowledge of The Ardennes Offensive, let alone those well read in WWII history.As other reviewers have said, the 1949 production of ""Battleground"" is a much more accurate and atmospheric movie than this Spanish filmed, historically dubious clunker.The laughingly bad final ""tank battle"", which looked like it was filmed in mid-summer Andalusia, is a real side-splitter; I half-expected El Cid to come riding into the frame, or maybe Lawrence of Arabia!",Battle of the Bulge VHS

Just some quick thoughts on this Superman movie...Superman - The Movie (1978) starring Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman is a very solid superhero movie, a very solid Superman movie.  The acting is good, the action is plentiful, and the special effects are great for the time period it was made.  I've seen Superman Returns (2006) and Man Of Steel (2013).  These movies were good, but I prefer the original older ones, including Superman II (1980).  They are just all around better, in my opinion.I'm not really into Superman all that much (I much prefer Batman), but once in a blue moon I'll watch a Superman movie for its entertainment value, and this movie delivers.

Some of the actors were changed out from their roles in the first part but this does not detract from the story.If you want a different point of view on what is happening with the economy and why nobody manufactures things in the USA anymore then I Highly suggest you watch part 1 first then this sequel.The author of Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand, was a child during the Russian revolution and her family fled to the USA. Through her family's experiences in early Soviet Russia, she writes a fictional story predicting the same economic collapse Russia experienced due to an overbearing yet well intentioned government.

348329,"By the time this film was released in England in August, 1944, its citizens had endured 5 long, bitter years of WW II. Maybe the producers intended it to give a fresh dose of optimism to a war weary public who had endured too many bombs, V-1, and V-2 rockets raining down on them from above.Using Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales as inspiration, the film makers set their characters in Kent and Canterbury during 1943. A common theme of American soldier, Englishwoman, and British soldier trying to come to terms with the war and each other forms the plot. A little bit of mystery is thrown in for good measure. While most such movies of that day could border on hackneyed plots and stereotypes, this one goes deeper, revealing hidden motivations and character development that draw the viewer in. One is left with the feeling of some kind of summation or conclusion to at least part of life's problems just around the next corner, which the Allies desperately needed as the recent Normandy invasion wound its way toward Germany and the Pacific forces ever closer to Japan.This movie captures some of the ""blood, toils, tears, and sweat"" that Churchill said was his countrymen's destiny.",A Canterbury Tale VHS

My only complaint is that compared to the current (very excellent) selection of UK suspense and mystery (most notably Sherlock and Foyle's War imo), this series falls a little short. Though Iain Glen is very good (as he was in Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones), the writing is decent and the show seems a bit contrived.Still, if you are a fan of a decent, modern day suspense/mystery then this might be a series you could enjoy. The American series are more easily digestible and more obviously entertaining, the British series seem to be a bit more understated and slower. The Australian series tend to fall somewhere in between. Hope that helps!","JACK TAYLOR, SET 1"

She is not having a good time at all and lets him know. When Ben gets an e-mail from his work telling him to stop in and pick something up he is surprised when the building he works at is empty and no one knows anything about it. When he finds out that all the people he worked with are dead and he is the next target he must find a way to save him and his daughter as well as find out the truth. This is a good movie and is worth watching but isn't really as exciting as the plot sounds. The movie is very tense at times and really keeps you watching. The easiest way to describe the movie is a mix of Mission Impossible, Eraser, and The Net. The only thing that really bugged me in this was the daughter. She seemed to be bi-polar, really wanting her dad to help, then next second being mad that he did. Watch and you will see what I mean. Overall, this is very much worth seeing.

1000548,"If you've never seen Les Miserables in any form, then please, watch this movie.  This is an epic human story that you have to see at least once in your life.  This movie conveys the story well, and you should enjoy watching some of your favorite actors in a high-budget film.Now, for those of you who are Les Miserables gourmets, there are certainly things in this version that fall far short of perfection -- especially musically.  If you are a singer or a musician, please don't watch this!  You might experience physical pain as you listen to the marginal singers.  Russell Crowe, as Javert, was a particular disappointment; Cosette and Marius duets often bordered on laughable; and the innkeepers' scenes were abrasive.If, however, you aren't so musically picky, you might want to give this incarnation of Victor Hugo's novel a chance.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway portrayed ValJean and Fontine with their whole heart and soul.  While I'm not 100% endorsing this film, I am 100% in approval of Anne Hathaway's Best Actress award.  One cannot view her performance with apathy.  I felt that I was watching movie history when I viewed her scenes.  It wasn't over-the-top; it wasn't over-acting; it didn't feel like she was trying to win an Oscar.  It just felt absolutely right.While the singing is weak in spots, the acting, the story, and the overall scope of the film are all wonderful.  These are the reasons for the four-star-rating.",N/A

After an absence of three plus years, Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley) returns, making this season extra sweet. The DVD cover art certainly should have pictured him, along with a better photo of Eric Fleming. Mr. Fleming's characterization of trail boss Gil Favor is the real reason to watch Rawhide, and has been what has brought me back to CBS for each successive volume I have purchased. Year after year he put in the most versatile acting, riveting the viewer into the plot, as he punched the stories through. Mr. Favor had the best life of any of his drovers, with side stories involving his daughters, and he improved any scene he was in. Season eight, by comparison, is a stampede; all the regulars except Rowdy, Wishbone, and Quince, were jettisoned; the camaraderie, gone.

One of my favorite characters is the young Irish chauffeur who falls in love with the English daughter of the manor and  watching as he juggles his conflicting beliefs and emotions.
