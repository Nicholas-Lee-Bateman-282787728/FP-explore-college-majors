1103707,"**1/2After the disastrous ""Ocean's Twelve"" was released in 2004, I ended my review by asking, ""We've already had [this saga] sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?""  Well, at long last that question has been answered, and it has come in the form of a good news/bad news proposition.  The good news is that ""Ocean's Thirteen"" marks at least a slight improvement over the previous installment (but then again that`s not a particularly high bar to jump over).  The bad news is that it is ONLY a slight improvement.For this latest entry in the series (which began, it is easy to forget, with the genuinely entertaining ""Ocean's Eleven"" in 2001), writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien, and director Steven Soderbergh have at least had the wisdom to return the boys back to Las Vegas, not having them traipsing all over Europe, as they did in the second installment, on what seemed like a high-cost junket for a bunch of already overpaid actors.  In ""Thirteen,"" Danny Ocean and his ""crew"" of con artist buddies rally behind the ailing Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), who has just been cheated out of his portion of a brand new casino by his unscrupulous partner, the allegorically named Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who wants the business all to himself.  The plan is to sabotage Bank's place so it will go belly-up even before it officially opens.At the beginning, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" seems like it might turn out to be a fairly decent caper movie, but after about the first half hour or so, a noticeable fatigue and lethargy begin to creep into both the writing and the performances.  Very quickly, the plot runs out of steam and we come to sense that the all-star players - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner et. al.- are merely going through the motions, hanging around just long enough to cash their hefty paychecks before heading off to worthier, more artistically rewarding endeavors.  Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Cheadle, in particular, have been striking out on such interesting career paths of late, that, perhaps, their hearts just aren't in this saga much anymore.  And without their acting like it matters, it makes it hard for us in the audience to feel that any of it matters either.""Ocean's Thirteen"" may be better than ""Ocean's Twelve,"" but it's still a largely half-hearted effort that does little to burnish the reputation of the original movie.  I think it's long past time to float this series out to sea so that its fine actors can continue pursuing more worthwhile projects.  We would all benefit from a win-win proposition like that.",N/A

187258,"I support local filmmaking.  I support the independent artist that wants to express himself/herself in the cinematic way.  What I enjoy with the independent artist is their way of expressing the already known.  For example, one of my favorite films is the independent sci-fi time travel piece called ""Primer"", you may or may not have heard of it.  The reason that I enjoy it so much is because it takes an old idea (that of time travel) and redefines it.  It recreates the wheel that Hollywood seems to cannot seem to do without CGI and actors with too much money.  It was exciting then to get Larry Fessenden's original student film ""Habit"" except with a bigger budget and after being immersed in the game a bit longer.  Fessenden's newer version of ""Habit"" gives us more gore, more scenery, and more ... well ... nudity than originally envisioned.  He takes the typical ""vampire"" wheel (a story that we have seen in countless films) and recreates - giving us a modern day horror that is built upon both mythological lore as well as personal demons.  During the course of 112 minutes, a great story is unfolded before our eyes - alas, it isn't the most powerful of stories, nor is it the most well-acted of stories, but it has something most Hollywood big-budget films seem to lack today , that is heart and substance.Fessenden, who not only does work behind the camera, but also as the main character named Sam, gives us a glimpse of New York city circa 1990.  Times seem to be tough, Sam works nights as a bartender and has found (after the death of his dad), that drinking dulls most of the pains.  One of our first introductions with Sam is at a party, where he arrives drunk and continues to drink throughout the course of the evening.  It is during this party that we meet the somewhat sensual Anna, who immediately locks target with Sam.  She entrances him similar to what Dracula did to Miss Mina, but in an eerie role reversal.  They continue their gathering outside, but in Sam's drunken stupor, he misses the opportunity to connect with Anna.  Not to worry vampire lovers, they reconnect after Anna supposedly snacks on one of Sam's friends - and the two begin a very physical courtship.  Oddly, Anna only appears at night, away from friends, and will not tell Sam anything about her.  She bits his lip, he thins its foreplay.  It dramatically changes when Sam seems to get sick over time, forgetting the simplest of tasks, and eventually driving himself mad with scenarios of what Anna may be doing to him.  Of coarse, nobody believes him, so not only does he battle with Anna's vying but also with his friends who seem to believe he is slowly going mad, which becomes the eventual focus to this film.  We are left with this surprising question in our minds as Fessenden ends with anything but your moment of zen.I would like to begin by saying that I thought this was an extremely strong outing for a low-budget director.  I wasn't hoping for Troma level, and I didn't get it.  I wasn't hoping for another repeat of ""Def By Temptation"", and thankfully it never showed.  What I witnessed with this film was an innovated director reinventing an old genre.  Hollywood continues every year to do this type of story, but their moments seem stale and recycled more than innovative and classic.  Fessenden uses his mind and truly makes a terrifying film that questions the basics of the vampire genre and relates them to modern cinema.  It is almost like a horror version of ""Fight Club"" except not as strong.  He uses violence, nudity, and realism to bring this fictional story into the light of New York City taking us to places that are familiar and at most, extremely spooky.  This is not a bad film, but I cannot boast that it is perfect.  It is continually flawed, forcing your to focus on the story because at times the acting is laughable at best and his ""A to B to C"" logic seems too overloaded and detailed.  The acting, outside of the verbal slandering of Aaron Beall's Nick, was just poor.  This could have been tightened up a bit to create stronger scenes between the characters.  I thought Sam was ""acting"" like he was drunk more than he was, the moments of intimacy seemed to be wanted instead of needed, and as we get closer to the end, the moments between Nick and Rae seem distant and lost.  Strength in the words would have tightened up this loose end.Secondly, I had trouble with parts of the story.  I don't want to disregard what Fessenden has done here because I think it is a strong moment in cinematic glory, but just small ends that needed to be less loose.  He started so strong with ""Habit"" that he couldn't keep the momentum flowing until the end.  One of my favorite scenes in the film is when he walks by a artist doing nude photos at night - a moment that seems similar to the movie that we are watching, but I loose it when he goes to Rae's grandmother's house and the Thanksgiving dinner there.  Fessenden also seems a bit loose on the entire ""loosing his father"" moments that seem to peak in and out of existence throughout the film.  I think that it helps us understand Sam's moments of insanity - especially near the end - but we needed more spent towards his father than at the ocean with friends.  There just seemed to be an unbalance in the force.  There are my only two complaints about the film (outside the fact I wished there was a director commentary), because I think Fessenden can do a decent job - just don't go off focus.Overall, I would suggest this film to only a select number of friends - those that appreciate the cinematic art.  I say this because to the unwilling eye, this will look like a cheap ""B"" horror film that teeters on nothing, but I saw so much more than that.  I saw a skilled director revisiting his old work to bring back into the public eye.  This is a great film about vampires, or at least the idea of vampires - but it is not for everyone.  It leaves the story open-ended, giving us a chance to make decisions for ourselves and that, in itself, is what creates the true horror.Oh, what about that goofy video that didn't seem to fit with the film - I guess I could do without that again, but I digress...Grade: *** out of *****",N/A

216356,"Had Billy Wilder directed no other film but SUNSET BLVD, he would still rank in the forefront of Hollywood directors. In the history of Hollywood film production, perhaps no film about film has captured so much about the industry in such fine fashion.Although made in that now long ago landmark year of 1950 (ALL ABOUT EVE also premiered that year), SUNSET still speaks to today. While the movie is about what happens to a great star of yesteryear who refuses to wake up and admit the parade has passed her by, the movie is not just about fading film stars. It is about anyone who has had a successful career in ANY field and who refuses to stop living in the past.The cast is letter-perfect. As archetypal has-been movie queen Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson plays the part to a fare-thee-well. By turns creepy, pathetic and brilliant, she makes us care about her, in spite of her autocratic behavior. William Holden is dead-on as failed screenwriter Joe Gillis. We understand his desperation while also cringing at how easily he becomes entangled in the spider web of Norma's neediness. The story is timeless and makes one wonder just how many former stars, still living in Hollywood, are playing out real-life variations of this brilliant screenplay. The ""look"" of the movie, especially the interior of Norma's Sunset Boulevard mansion, is practically a character itself. Its ambience as an aging, crumbling shrine to Norma's glory days ensnares and fascinates us the same way Norma does Joe. Cecil B. DeMille and Hedda Hopper playing themselves; and has-been (and Hollywood great) Buster Keaton essentially playing himself as one of Norma's bridge-playing cronies are bonuses in a film that is truly not to be missed. Forget most of the dreck now appearing at your local cineplex and rent this DVD---or better, buy it. It holds up to many, many repeat viewings.",N/A

Imagine a family film like ""Benji"" or ""Lassie"" and replace the dog with a zombie!First and foremost, this is not your typical zombie movie. While the zombies in this movie are typical of zombies movies, this movie is not.1) ACTING: The acting was great! There were no problems here. Everyone seemed to be very comfortable in their roles. No one seemed to be miscast.2) PRODUCTION: This is a quality movie done right. I have no complaints. This movie was set in the decade of the 1950's and great steps were taken to faithfully recreate that era. From the cars to the homes to even the soundtrack, the viewer feels like they are in the 1950's. While there was not an incredible amount of blood & gore for a zombie film, it was there, along with an occasional arm or leg being chewed on, and was handled well. The zombie make up varied with different color faces and minimal face appliances.3) ZOMBIES: The zombies in this one are your typical flesh eating Romero shamblers that do show signs that they remember when they were alive and also are capable of showing emotion. (Like Bub from DOTD)4) THE CAUSE: Mysterious particles from outer space raise the dead.This a wonderful (almost family friendly) zombie film. I enjoyed it completely, and was not disappointed at all. I would higly recommend this movie to everyone. However, if you are looking for a blood & gore, zombies on the rampage, death and destruction, action movie, then you may want to pass on this one. This is a wonderful satire, but not a full fledged ""zombie movie.""RATING: 5 out of 5",Fido

Originally running at 196 minutes with Overture and Intermission plus 26 minutes of footage.

I have not read the short story that this movie was based upon, but I want to.  More importantly, my daughter wants me to read it to her.  The movie does have a very E.T. like formula.  Child finds alien/future toy, Gov't gets involved, alien/future toy is dying and must be sent home,  Children fly, Children escape the gov't and get the alien/future toy back in the nick of time.

1071996,"This is not a completely straightforward monster movie and will probably disappoint a lot of people expecting the wrong thing.  The director of this film did Memories of Murder, a very dark and excellent Seven-ish movie about one of the first serial killers in South Korea (see it; much better than this); people were quite surprised by this choice of a follow-up project, I gather.  I could see that some of the black humor here might be lost on viewers unfamiliar with his other work or just not paying attention.  For example, the mourning scene is quite genuinely sad but also quite comical at the very same time, and this sort of mix in the same scene isn't your typical Hollywood approach.  The reveal of the monster is another case in point where expectations are purposefully confounded (small spoiler alert).  I thought it was one of the funniest sequences I had seen in a genre picture in ages, and it is precisely the beauty of it that the monster does not have a slow steady unveiling throughout the movie, as some people have criticized the movie for.  The very brief shot of this wacky fish monster rampaging (lumbering) across the field in broad daylight from the woman's p.o.v. in the bus traveling overhead is absolutely priceless.Unfortunately, though I wanted to like this, I have to be honest about several things.  The script is a bit workmanlike and, after the first third or so, starts to feel more and more routine.  It almost feels like a first draft: things could have been much more interesting or compelling or different, but as it is the plot turns just kind of meander to the conclusion.  The movie's main characters don't quite have enough room to develop independently in my opinion, so, despite the heavy emphasis on their interaction and emotions, the movie doesn't really succeed for me as a family drama.  Also, while I am all for pointed critiques of American adventurism abroad (okay, hegemony, sorry to use the word), the film's politics, for which it has gotten some praise in some lefty-leaning media outlets, are simplistic and caricatured in the exact same way as the average Hollywood genre picture, it's just that the villains here are Americans and the obedient South Korean state.  Frankly, caricaturing your villains no matter what the politics of your movie is has rather limited rewards.  Also, people who enjoy nitpicking or attacking plausibility would have a field day with this, as many plot developments or actions are rather random, puzzling, or farfetched but really, it's a movie about a big walking man-eating amphibious creature, so that's probably a waste of your time.  On the whole, I was entertained and I am glad to have seen it but, after a great opening stretch, the movie for me lost some momentum and became less and less successful.  Better to go in with lowered expectations, but still, this is much better than the average.Don't watch the dubbed version; the dub is terrible, as bad as they usually are, and listening to mediocre poorly paid voice actors is pretty much a surefire way to ruin any possible appreciation for the positive features of this film (or others).  Watch the subtitled version, trust me.",N/A

429102,"Wait, one more stupid line from the movie.  ""Ken were cops, we don't do this"".First off if you do not like martial arts movies then this will not be worth your time.  If you love Jean Claude Van Damme and all the great b-action movies like 'No Retreat, No Surrender' then you will absolutely love this flick and it will become an instant classic for you.  It is actually from the same film company that discovered Jean Claude and did all the 'No Retreat, No Surrender' movies.  The owner of the Seasonal Film Company(Ng See-Yuen)actually discovered old school stars like Jackie Chan and Hwang Jang Lee and produced their first successful movies.  So when I saw Tony Leung Siu Hung and Ng's name on the back of the box, I had to have it.  VERY rarely are American martial arts movies good.  Sometimes they end up being a great movie but the fight scenes will be limited and only average.  'Bloodmoon' is the exact reverse.  It has spectacular fight scenes, it's badly directed, and it's filled with enough cheese to at least laugh at the stupidness of it sometimes.  There is even that part where they go to a strip bar and we get to see surgically enhanced women.The movie stars out by ripping off 'Beverly Hills Cop' with an Eddie Murphy clone playing the cop.  The only thing that makes this character different from Eddie Murphy is that he loves kung fu.  This is a down point of the movie since he is certainly not the worst actor but the script could not get any worse.  The really good thing though is that he can seriously fight.  I thought it was a stunt double at first glance since his first fight is in the dark, but even in the light this guy was doing some amazingly tough choreographed fight scenes.  One is a 3 on 1 fight with the killer.  If they did double for him at all they fooled me.  Then there is a woman fighter who is very good and you will for sure notice the stunt doubling for her.  You have to watch for when Rob Van Damme(a wrestler) gets thrown through a window, they show a close up of his double for about 5 seconds.  Personally, it was my favorite part of the movie.  So Gary Daniels joins this unfunny Eddie Murphy type of cop to find a killer.  This guy goes around killing a bunch of tough people.  Luckily he doesn't just kill quickly but challenges them and we get these amazing fights scenes.  The first fight was awesome but when he stuck his fingers into the guys chest to kill him, I thought for sure this movie would end up being a waste of time.  Then you have that one part where the killer posts his murders on the internet and they try to track him down.  Of course now the computer geek is saying ""OK, he's in Bejing, wait, he's in Berlin, no, he's in Moscow"".  This may sound like a bad movie and it is but the amount of fights and the quality of them is what makes it good.  All great fights and most of them are extended going 5 minutes or so.  For a die-hard martial arts movie fan like me it just does not get better than this.  The fights are brutal and I have to say that they are some of the best I have seen in a while.  There is unfortunately a bit of wirework with the wires clearly seen but that is to be expected from a movie of this type of budget.Now like all great martial arts movies every actor needs to be somebody who actually looks good fighting on screen and the villian needs to standout as the baddest mother on the block.  Darren Shahlavi gets the job done nicely and his steel tipped boots are a nice touch.  There is actually metal on the whole bottom of his boots and up the whole heel.  He really gets to show off his sklls and how many great kicks he has.Now I will say it once more so people don't get confused by my 4 star rating.  This movie is a cheesy cop drama with a few good comic moments and it has some truly great fight scenes.  So it is not for everyone and I warn you all that this movie has one of the stupidest endings of all time.  ""Ha ha ha ha, this is the endgame Ken"".  No not the ending sequence fights and Gary Daniel's race to save his family, that was bad, but the very last moment of the movie.  It is the finest of cheese that you will ever find in a film.I have to once again mention how great the fighting was and how great of a job that director/action director Tony Leung Siu Hung did.  His choreography and editing of the fights is about as good as it gets.  Now I just have to see the other American martial arts movie he directed which is called 'Superfights' and my life will be complete.  Seriously, the movie is called Superfights.I will warn you right now that this DVD from the Weinstein Company is sub-standard.  Big surprise huh?  Well of course it is not a surprise.  These are the same people that edited down every Jet Li and Jackie Chan movie and not only cut it up but never offered their DVD's in the original Asian language.  So luckily this is actually an American movie and we don't have to bother with the bad dubbing, just the bad acting.  The DVD is presented in full screen and the picture quality is average.  The first 2 fights were a bit blurry but it seems to clear up from there.  Good sound quality.There are no special features except filmographies.One more bad line-""Don't worry honey, daddy's gonna save us"".Just one more line I promise.  It does not have anything to do with the movie but you'd think that it would-""Did you notice there's blood on the moon tonight?"" the masked killer asks in a dark voice as he has his leg extended in the air showing off his devastating martial arts skills.",N/A

Yes, the book is much more detailed and interesting at certain points but it would be impossible to adapt it all into the movie.  Standing on its own, this film still delivers.Will McClean is in his senior year at the Carolina Military Institute in 1964 in the Deep South.  For the first time in the institute's history, they're going to admit a black cadet and this at a time when racial issues are still readily evident.  Will is directed by his chain of command to protect this individual and track his progress.  What is not known right away is information about a secret society within the institute known as `The 10'.  This group recruits the best cadets from within the ranks but prey on the weak and unfortunate who they decide are not worthy of remaining in the institute.  And they use whatever methods they deem necessary to force out the undesirables.As the year progresses, disturbing events begin to happen and Will learns new information about `The 10' regarding just how powerful and influential they are.  So much so that it may seriously jeopardize his relationship with his roommates and his career.  Forced to question his beliefs in an honorable military system and compelled to make the right decisions no matter the cost, he risks everything in a dramatic and exciting showdown with `The 10'.  This leads to a nice conclusion to the movie.If you have or haven't read the book that this movie is based on, it's really not that bad in and of itself.  There are a few weak points now and again but the cast is good, the story holds together, and the acting is pretty solid.  Just don't go into watching this while comparing everything to the book because that'll be a let down.  I know because I watched it again after reading the book.  With that in mind, I recommend this movie to everyone.",Lords of Discipline VHS

Reb Brown(the hero) flexes his muscles and shouts a lot, the heroine is at least 10 years older than the hero(she looks like his mother), and the bad guy comes across like silent movie bad guy(only he does have the evil laugh down pat, really, he uses it every 10 mins.).The story is some mess about the title event and it has some of the worst chase scenes (on floor sweepers and tricked out golf carts) ever put on screen.

905646,"Lucino Visconti's ""White Nights"" (1957) - is an engaging, uplifting, and compelling screen adaptation of Dostoyevsky's short story. I applaud to Visconti's masterful and elegant direction - everything is exquisite in his masterpiece. The settings came from a fairy tale - he moved his heroes to the dream like city that looked very much like Venice - with its canals and bridges. Original story took place in 19th century St. Petersburg - which always has been nicknamed ""The Northern Venice"". The film is set in the modern time. I was curious to see how Visconti would play the title. ""White Nights"" is the period of time in the beginning of June when the nights in St. Petersburg are very short. Alexander Pushkin described this time in one of his poems -""The morning rushes to catch the evening only giving darkness two short hours"". Visconti's film takes place in the beginning of winter and during the last meeting between the heroes, the snow began to fall, giving the title and to the two final scenes new, deep, and very moving meaning. Is the ending happy or the sad one? I still don't know but what is certain that it is unforgettable. I also want to mention three lead actors who made this story so real, tender, sad, and poetic: Maria Shell as a desperate woman awaiting the return of her fairy tale prince - Jean Cocteau's leading man Jean Marais and lonely, shy clerk Marcello Mastroianni who was happy once if only for a few short minutes.P.S. The ""Dancing Scene"" stands alone as one of the best scenes in the history of Cinema.",Le Notti Bianche
1012809,"Season 5 of Andromeda is better than season 4. A lot better. But unfortunately that isn't really saying very much. The final season of this show saw a return to a slightly more goal-oriented, arc-based storytelling, and that is definitely in its favor.The trouble is that the goal is too vague and too pointless. The show started out back in season 1 with the goal of restoring the Commonwealth. The goal in season 5? Repair the ship and get out of a claustrophobic star system. Whenever you go from something so grandiose to something so basic, there's practically no way to keep it from being a disappointment.While there were a few decent moments in the season, such as the return of Hohne and the corridor scene with Harper in the last episode, they are few and far between. And, more importantly, they can't compete with such ridiculous horrors as making Drago Museveni - the father of all Nietzcheans - into an annoying punk, rather than the warrior that the images of his remains would have you believe he was (remains which they actually show in that episode, by the way). The season tries to have more good moments than it actually does, but many of them fall flat, such as the whole thing with Beka's ""father"". The rest of the time, one of the main cast punches somebody for looking at them the wrong way, because that is clearly the best way to solve all problems, including diplomatic ones. Add on top of all this the conspicuous absence of Lexa Doig (Andromeda herself) for much of the season.Dylan Hunt was never the most interesting character on the show (that honor would go to either Tyr Anasazi or Rev Bem), but when the show first started out he was not the larger-than-life character that he eventually became. In season 1, and somewhat in season 2, Dylan was wrong sometimes. He sometimes made morally questionable decisions in pursuit of his goals. What made him likable was that he was always trying to do the right thing, even when he went about it in questionable ways.Over the years, his character transformed into an over-the-top hero. Always right. Always good. There was no questioning his decisions, because he was the Super Awesome Captain. It really did become Hercules In Space, except less fun. Despite some attempts in season 5 to add more interesting facets to his character (making him into an evolved Vedran, for example), he retained the one trait that made the character completely uninteresting: infallibility.Season 5 could have been worse. It could have been another season 4. But the fact of the matter is that it simply wasn't enough to redeem what started out as an imperfect but promising show. More than anything, season 5 left me with a feeling of ""who cares?""The final episode brought the show back to its Commonwealth/anti-Abyss focus, but it had been absent for so long, and things had been left in such a state of disarray without resolution, that it just didn't cut it. There were too many abandoned threads in the Commonwealth storyline, which adds up to nothing but too little reason to be interested.Consider: despite a season 2 episode indicating that the Vedrans were still around and very much aware of Hunt's mission to restore the Commonwealth, when the Vedran homeworld is finally reunited with the rest of the known worlds, you don't see any Vedrans. Aside from the fact that the people in that system can now travel to other places, there's nothing to indicate that the reunion even matters in the grand scheme of things.",N/A
653749,"When I heard that a ""Transformers"" film was in the works, I became excited.  ""Yes, yes, yes! This is gonna rule!""When I heard who was directing it. ""Oh.""I have yet to see a Michael Bay movie that wasn't exciting (except maybe Pearl Harbor). This guy knows how to blow the socks off of his audience in terms of action sequences, and Transformers certainly did that, without a doubt. It's fair to say that Michael Bay is one of the best action film directors there is. It's also fair to say that he one of the worst storytellers in Hollywood.He butchered the Transformers, at least as I remember them growing up, but that wasn't a letdown. I heard the director's name and I saw it coming. Therefore I am able to give this movie three stars. The story was ridiculous, but the kid in the main role did okay, and the chick was hot and the action was SICK!! And THAT'S why I pay to see Michael Bay's films. The plot just moves the ""story"" from A to B and finally to Z and is nothing special-- never is when Bay is involved. But I knew I'd love the action. He never fails me there. So, the movie only sucked a little.One purist complaint I have (and I can complain for hours about how this wasn't like the Transformers of my youth) isn't that Bumblebee was a Chevy Camaro instead of a VW Bug (we have VW to thank for that). That upset plenty of old-school fans of the toys and animated series. My biggest problem is that while the Autobots as characters were fleshed out about as well as Michael Bay knows how to flesh out characters in his films, the Decepticons had zero personality and not enough screen time in my opinion. They were just evil, cold, machines that had little to say to each other, and just went on a destructive rampage.C'mon man! Where's the rivalry between Megatron and Starscream? Where is all the wisecracking and taunting between them and the Autobots? Why don't we see as much of the Decepticons? They were equal parts in the series. That, to me, was the biggest disappointment, never mind the flimsy storytelling which I was prepared for going in.I won't say its better, but I highly recommend the 1986 Animated Transformers movie. As action goes it can't compete with Michael Bay, but it's classic Tranformers.I can go on, but there are other, better, longer reviews that do it for me, so I'll wrap this up and say that, yeah, it's a good movie, a bad story, but still a damn fine piece of action, and I will buy this on dvd. I'm still up in the air over whether I'll get it in HD or not. I wish they'd put this on a HD DVD Combo Disc like ""300"" did. I'm just not sure that this movie is worth the extra expense of buying it on HD, but for action fans this movie truly delivers action. It falls short in the story department, but that's Michael Bay for you.",Transformers
264809,"I first viewed this movie almost a decade ago, and it only gets better with repeated viewing, that's how good it is! The movie begins with a little kid who is trapped in a witch's house, with the witch herself preparing to serve him up as the main course for her coven's dinner. The kid proceeds to buy himself time by telling stories to the witch, and the three stories make up the movie. The first revolves around a college student who uses arcane means to resurrect an ancient mummy for his own purposes [Christian Slater & Julianne Moore are in this], the second is about an old man who hires a hit man to kill a malevolent cat, but the cat has a few tricks in the bag, and the last story [also my favorite] is kind of a romance/horror about a struggling artist who encounters a horrific murder, only to escape death and find true love in the form of the lovely Rae Dawn Chong who harbors some dark secrets of her own.

I watched the first few episodes last night.  The picture and sound quality are both excellent.  The packaging is cute (wooden box with Land of Giants comic book, key chain, and patch), but not at all necessary.  I strongly suspect that if they hadn't gone a little overboard on the packaging, the cost would have been less.

14206,"""Sunset"" is one of the best 'odd couple' films I've ever seen.  Bruce Willis (Tom Mix) and James Garner (Wyatt Earp) work together beautifully.  And the story could be the truth 'give or take a lie or two.'  Mix was one of Earp's pallbearers and wept openly at his funeral.""Sunset's"" a funny and heartrending take on Hollywood.  You see deadly gunfights acted out with the old gunfighter watching from the wings.  You also see cruelty, corruption and sadism in real life that couldn't have taken place in films of that vintage.My main reason for giving this film less than a 5 is because the video and audio were very poorly dubbed.  I'm not entirely sure whether I got a bad press or the whole batch is like this, but it was apparent and distracting from the film itself.Still, ""Sunset"" is very worth watching and keeping for your viewing pleasure again.",N/A

Do you trust that gut feeling, that occasional twinge of intuition that urges you to take a chance and rent something unknown?That's exactly how I came upon the obscure little gem from '02, `Bollywood Queen.' I absolutely fell in love with this movie just minutes into my first viewing. While this is by no means a big budget production, it's as good as one. The plot is solid, the acting excellent and the female star of the movie Preeya Kalidas is absolutely beautiful, which is a major pre-requisite for any guy to enjoy a romantic film.

Lo Lieh plays the master of disguise and we don't find out until the end exactly what is going on between Lieh and Gordon.The main problem is that this movie is boring and doesn't have many fights.  I don't mind a kung fu movie that only has a few fights as long as it is a good story.  The story is not very good in this movie and it just mainly involves bad comedy.  The only part I laughed at is when Lau Wing and Lee Hoi San have to fight a bunch of lepers.  It was one of those moments that is funny only because it is so incrediby stupid.  While the action is sparse, it is very good when it comes.  There are only 3 real fights and they are all VERY good.  The 2nd one is a silent fight where the 2 can't make any noise so that they don't alert the guards outside.  The final fight is very good with a 3 section metal staff against a sword but they lose the weapons pretty quick and go hand to hand.  The first fight is actually the best, the silent one is second, and the finale is third.  All in all, a very average movie that could have been much better with a few more fights.

299553,"How sad that a person can forego the deepest and best that life has to offer because they feel that their ""ugliness"" cannot outshine their inner beauty?Such is the well known CYRANO de BERGERAC,a man with such a large nose that this self-perceived impediment causes him to over develop his rapier wit and tenderness of soul,  never being able to feel the sense that he could be loved for who and what he is.Having seen this Rostand play done on stage, Gerard Depardieu and Anne Brochet simply light up the screen in this Jean-Paul Rappeneau directed version of the French Classic as the ""deformed"" Cyrano and his object of love,his cousin,Roxane.Vincent Perez,always the handsome leading man, does a marvelous comedic turn as Christien, the love-struck cadet who is a bumbler at words  to whom Cyrano lends his poetic tongue to win Roxane for him.What I find exceptional about this CYRANO is Rappeneau's tremendous attention to the smallest of detail regarding the customs and historical facts concerning the times.The story is already a winner, but Rappeneau makes this also a film that is interesting to people who love accuracy concerning history and custom.There is also a proper treatment of the comedic side of this tragedy that I find lacking in other versions.Rappeneau knows how to make us both laugh and cry in his CYRANO thus keeping a proper balance of the tender and the comedic.Anne Brochet as Roxane is allowed to be the beauty that she is (unlike her plainess in ALL THE MORNINGS OF THE WORLD) and she is the ideal actress to bring Roxane to the big screen.She has a fragile beauty and depth rarely found!Depardieu is, well what can one say,THE BEST.Others may disagree,but Depardieu is the first actor ever to make me love  Cyrano de Bergerac.Others were okay,but Depardieu IS Cyrano.As to format,I personally find the digital video transfer version still superior to the dvd in both picture quality and sound.The dvd is"" scrunched"" looking while the vhs version is not.In any format, though,this is the definitive CYRANO in my book.The english tranlation is perfectly accessible and the subtitles are very clear and not rushed.If you ""parlez francais"" then all the better this CYRANO.An excellent companion film that covers the exact same time frame would be MARQUISE (French) starring Sophie Marceau.",N/A

The second entry has a gorgeous MGM gloss, and assured direction by Victor Fleming. It also has Spencer Tracy, a fabulous actor whose Hyde is a subtler rendition, a man with a heavier brow and leering expression, whose change seems more behavioral than physical. The second version also boasts the luminous Ingrid Bergman, playing against type as a streetwalker. See both entries, and make up your own mind. You won't go far wrong either way.",N/A
833645,"I undoubtedly a fan of the whole Degrassi series.  I started out watching Degrassi Junior High when I was in high school.  I could so relate to the series.  When Michelle's father burned the food & started crying after his wife walked out that was my life!!  I felt a certain affinity for Michelle for packing up & moving out because she couldn't stand her fathers racism towards her new boyfriend BLT.My main problem with the new generation is that the children act like adults.  Sure in the first season the kids pretty much acted like kids but they quickly grew up and became super glammed up tiny adults.  I could hardly listen to Paige go on & on about how wonderful she's going to do at Banting College.  She gets into Banting only to freak out, burn down her dorm room & drop out.  Paige has a crush on Alex who turns to stripping instead of college.  I can't relate to either of those characters.  When I was in high school I did not have it all figured out.  I hardly have it more figured out now.  It doesn't sit well with me to watch 15 year olds wax on about how their lives are going to be wonderful once they get discovered like Manny wants to be.  I could care less about Craig.  When his character was introduced there was an air of mystery about him.  He's quickly turned into the typical guy with a tiny bit of talent who uses his charm to seduce any girl he can.  I don't find his character attractive.  I didn't know nor do I know any 16 year olds who are touring the world or going around to pubs playing music and snorting coke.  Sorry, doesn't happen that often in the real world.  Craig talks Ashley into sleeping with him at the same time he's sleeping with Manny who winds up pregnant. I still don't understand how Manny knew the baby was Craig's & not Sully's since she was sleeping with them both at the same time. In a perfect world, Ashley would see through Craig for what he was.  She goes on this tangent about how she wanted to DIEEEEEE last semester.  I remember crushes in high school and feeling that bad also but at some point you need to get a grip & move on.I feel Caitlin needs to do the same thing.  I can't believe that she is STILL stuck on Joey.  In Degrassi High, Joey basically did a Craig on Caitlin.  Joey slept with Tessa Campeneli while he slept with Caitlin for the first time.  If I were Caitlin I'd declare Joey dead to me.  I wouldn't get caught back into the madness 15 years later!!!I find Peter super annoying.  I can totally see how his character could suck some gullible gals in.  Looks wise he's attractive but I don't find anything else about him attractive.  Sure he posted the video of Manny pulling down her top at a party in the bathroom all over the school that was half his problem and half Manny's. Just because Manny was drunk doesn't mean that she's innocent of her actions.  I also have a problem with Emma.  She started out as this odd looking blonde string bean and she blossomed into a very pretty girl but I think she takes it too far.  I have a problem with her over made up look in every frame.  She's in high school!!  I don't understand the whole cheer squad thing as well.  Aren't there any ""Adults"" who are leading the squad?  How in the world can the school of Degrassi let high school students choose who gets to be on the squad and who doesn't?I know this post is rambling but it lays out some of the problems I have with the show.  One thing I liked about the original Degrassi was that the kids were kids and they'd say ""I'm just a kid I don't know everything.""  In this new Degrassi the kids have it all figured out, why do I even need to watch?",N/A

464692,"Some reviewers have come away from this film with the impression that it is an instructional film, letting English speaking audiences become aware of the basic story of the enlightenment of Prince Siddharta. Other reviewers have focused on the Seattle family which is transported out of their previous existance and culture into the possibility that their young son is a reincarnation of a holy LLama. Whereas I think this film does both of these story lines justice, I think there is a third story line in the film which is just as strong. This story is the quest by Llama Norbu for the reincarnation(s) of his teacher, then the death of Llama Norbu after his mission is accomplished, and finally the very moving spritual ceremonies at the end of the film where the monks mourn for Llama Norbu and the three children spread the ashes of Llama Norbu in Bhutan, India, and Seattle Washington.Bartolucci gives us first a story line that Western audiences can accept; a white upper class American family is moved from their everyday existance to another culture and belief system by a group of gentle Tibetian monks. Within this story line is a child's version of the story of Prince Siddharta, played by Keanu Reeves, relating the origins of the Buddha.

1095206,"This collecton honors Barbara Stanwyck's 100th birthday with six titles not previously on DVD and under the control of Warner Home Video. Her screen persona was generally that of a tough-as-nails woman of the world, sometimes with nefarious motives, and this collection tends to give you a broader view of her talents showing fine performances in some well-known as well as lesser known films. All of these films are in the post-code era, and this is probably because Warner Home Video has plans for her pre-codes in their Forbidden Hollywood series. For example, WB has already announced that they have plans for Stanwyck's classic pre-code ""Night Nurse"" to be put on DVD. At any rate, here are the films and extras in this set:Annie Oakley (1935)The oldest film in the collection, great dramatic license is taken with Oakley's real life story. Stanwyck does a good job of portraying Oakley in this film, still making use of the tough reputation she had in parts in the pre-code era and translating it into a time when less could get past the censors. There's quite a bit of comedy in this western, and George Stevens does a good job of directing all involved.Special Features:Main Street Follies, vintage 1935 short starring Hal Le RoyInto Your Dance, vintage 1935 cartoonSubtitles in English and FrenchMy Reputation (1946)Next we jump ahead ten years with Stanwyck playing a woman who is grieving over the death of her husband.  She not only has the timeless problem of being a single mother raising two teenage sons, she must also deal with the issue of her reputation - as dictated by society at that time and by her mother and friends specifically. She gets involved with an Army officer (George Brent) who is the love them and leave them type, and as a result has trouble from everyone she knows. Stanwyck is great as a woman who has to learn to go it alone and stand up for herself for the first time. Brent is less convincing as a bit of a cad - he usually plays such stand-up guys and even played opposite Rin-Tin-Tin early in his career! At any rate, it's a good display of Stanwyck's talents in a different and vulnerable kind of role for her.

One of his past flames, Ava Gardner, is back in town to try to take Mason away from Stanwyck permanently. This film also reunites Stanwyck with Van Heflin who both have great chemistry together. Great performances, a good plot, and an overall enjoyable film.Special Features:Counterfeit Cat, vintage MGM Tex Avery cartoonStuff for Stuff, vintage MGM short subjectOriginal theatrical trailerSubtitles: English and FrenchTo Please a Lady (1950)This film pairs Clark Gable with Stanwyck. Gable plays a renegade racing driver whose driving tactics during a race cause the death of another driver. Stanwyck plays a no-nonsense newspaper reporter out to expose Gable's professional tactics and end his career. This might actually be more interesting to car racing fans than to Stanwyck fans because of the great footage of racing and behind the scenes footage of the sport as it existed in 1950. Stanwyck does the best she can with a somewhat thin script, and it is above average entertainment, but it is probably the weakest entry in the set.Jeopardy (1953)This film is a thriller that is rather hard to categorize - it is almost avante-garde in nature. It starts out calmly enough - the Stilwin family is vacationing on an isolated stretch of beach. However, while rescuing their son, Doug Stilwin (Barry Sullivan) gets his leg caught and is stuck in the water. He is fine now - at low tide. High tide will be another matter. His wife (Barbara Stanwyck) goes for help and instead picks up an escaped killer. He proposes an interesting trade to her in exchange for his help. This is a great suspenseful movie and I'm surprised it is not better known and not shown more on TV. Meeker is very good as the criminal. His onscreen persona is an interesting cross between Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando and he has good chemistry with Stanwyck in this one.

The funny thing is, Stanwyck isn't really the star in this movie - William Holden is. That's not to say Stanwyck fans won't get their money's worth though, particularly in her showdown scene with Holden and in the last scene where she outperforms everyone just by sitting in a chair and observing. This film is about the details of a power struggle when the founder of a large corporation suddenly dies. It basically boils down to two factions - the innovators and the bean counters. It's how these two groups dance around each other in their maneuvers for power that will hold your interest. The film is still relevant because big business is still about these two groups today. It is a common story of business - someone starts a company out of their love for building a superior product and somewhere along the way - often after the founder's death or retirement - the bean counters take over and regard only profits without remembering that the superior product is where those profits come from. Outstanding entertainment.Special Features:Feature commentary by Oscar-winning director Oliver StoneOut for Fun, vintage MGM Pete Smith ShortBilly Boy, vintage MGM Tex Avery CartoonOriginal theatrical trailerSubtitles: English & Spanish (feature film only)My biggest disappointment in this set is a lack of biographical material on Stanwyck's career, which was a long and illustrious one.

1097905,"One should not be surprised by some of the negative reviews for this new Futurama full-length movie, because that's how hardcore fans behave. I'm one myself. The negative reviews are over-reacting to minor weaknesses that are certainly worthy of concern but aren't the end of the world. Some of the concerns are definitely legitimate, to be sure. The comedic timing is a bit off as compared to the original series, the dramatic scenes are overwrought at times, and the musical numbers are awkward (except for Coolio's rapping as Kwanzaa Bot). But hardcore fans who decide that they hate this new release due to those factors are sorely missing the forest for the trees. Everything else about this movie is still loveable, especially in comparison to all the other creations that have somehow survived on TV for much longer than the stupendously creative and intricately hysterical Futurama. Here we have the usual awesome space age animation, put to even greater effect in widescreen format, and the story is very cleverly written and hilariously fascinating (if a bit convoluted at times). While I would have liked to see more of Dr. Zoidberg, all the best primary and secondary characters of the Futurama universe make appearances here, there are great developments in the saga of Fry and Leela, and as usual Bender runs the show no matter which personality he's operating under.Despite a few writing and production flaws (possibly just the result of being out of the game for a few years), I'm ecstatic that the Futurama team has gotten the chance to bring their unique universe and lovable characters back to life. Serious fans should not ignore the great opportunities offered by this film and its three upcoming counterparts. As for this DVD package, the extras are generally okay, but watch out in particular for the preposterously ridiculous full episode of ""Everybody Loves Hypnotoad."" Even that show is better than most of what Fox offers these days. Remember the future!!! [~doomsdayer520~]",Futurama: Bender's Big Score

862000,"Having done all four workouts included on the dvd I can say that overall I'm happy that I added these to my collection.The first two workouts combine kickboxing and step moves. I'd never done this type of combination before and I found this combination to be really interesting and challenging.Even though I was ""all over the place"" trying to do some of the step moves I must admit it was actually fun (and would have probably been pretty entertaining to watch if someone saw me flailing away in my den:)).I wanted to mention that you don't actually need a step to do these workouts (and I don't currently own one) because there's one exerciser showing the moves without a step. I actually used my Yoga mat as a visual reference and stepped on that in place of a step. This worked well because it being my first time doing these workouts I'd probably have fallen off of a step :)The workouts themselves were very well designed overall but unfortunately they are marred by moments of REALLY stupid camera work! From time to time the camera people focus on a close up of an exerciser or scenery when a new move was being introduced. ""Stupid"" is the best way I can describe that and I can't even begin to imagine what they were thinking while they were filming! :)Still, it accounts for only a small percentage of the overall workouts. Certainly they were extremely frustrating moments but I just kept moving until I could ""catch up"" and this was more of an issue in the first two (kick box/step) rather than the last two (kickboxing only) workouts.In spite of the occasional camera foolishness, the workouts themselves are really great and creative!The kickboxing-only workouts, which are the 3rd and 4th programs on the dvd are well worth the low cost of the dvd even if you don't ever use the kick box/step programs. They are non-stop, fun, challenging and high energy.The design of the program was great in the way Shelley led you from the warm ups to the Kickbox type moves to cardio segments (and occasional squats on the Kickbox 1 segment as well). Of course being from a TV show there transitions between commercials aren't always seamless but it's not a big deal either.So I guess I'd say that if you are a fan of the Caribbean workout programs (which I have been for a while, I really love the three Pilates discs I have) then you'll probably enjoy this one as well! Just don't expect perfection in terms of the  camera work or transitions between commercials and you'll probably find they are really worthwhile in terms of the time spent doing them (only about 22 minutes) and certainly worth the cost.!",Kickboxing

644829,"Turns out I really enjoyed this. I know there are a lot of reasons why it might be fashionable to dislike this movie: because it is made by Disney, because it is a summer blockbuster, because it is based of a theme park attraction, because it is a sequel, because of the heartthrob actors in this movie...But when you get right down to it, it's actually just a really fun adventure movie: part Indiana Jones, part Treasure Island, part 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Sure some of the jokes are a bit corny, some of the plot doesn't really make senses, (and for that matter, neither does a lot of the physics), but there's enough pirates, sword battles, sea monsters, and explosions to satisfy the 12 year old boy in all of us.Although the movie was bloodless, there was a fairly high body count by the time it was all over, and I'm a little surprised it got released under the Disney banner instead of under Touchstone or one of their other labels. Maybe this is a sign of how the standards have changed over the last 20 years. (I also have it one good authority from a New Zealand friend that the word ""Bugger"" is offensive enough over there that only in the last few years has it been allowed on television, but Johnny Depp makes good use of it in this Disney movie.)It was nice that this movie brought back all of the major characters, and even most of the minor ones, from the previous movie. I always enjoy a franchise that takes care of its casting continuity. In fact the only person I thought was noticeable missing from the first movie was that women on Johnny Depp's crew (what was her name again?).As a fan of ""The Office"", I especially enjoyed the fact that McKenzie Crook, who played a minor character in the first movie, was brought back and given a slightly expanded role. What do you reckon, did the cult following ""The Office"" has in the US play any bearing on this casting decision, or did they just like his character from the first movie?",N/A

635839,"I must start this review off by saying that I'm not a comic book fan so I cannot say whether the characters were portrayed accurately (i.e. the way they were depicted in the Marvel comics of the same name).  However, I found this to be an enjoyable, entertaining little film - quite a surprise actually.  Most comic-book heroes brought to cinema tend to have an extremely dark side - requiring a secret identity and so forth.  Not so here - no secret identities, no traumatic events as children or any of that stuff.  (I suppose you *could* call the event that made them into the Fantastic Four 'traumatic' but I didn't see it as such.)A well-cast film - I especially enjoyed Chris Evans as the irrepressible Johnny Storm/Human Torch (girls call him ""Torch"") who is totally in his element at almost 4,000 degrees (not to mention the fact that even without the flames, the man is HOT)!  Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/the Thing brings both pathos and humor to the role - I especially enjoyed his rapport with the teasing Johnny Storm.  Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd - rounded out the Four perfectly.  And Von Doom was played with the right amount of ruthlessness, cunning, and greed by Julian McMahon - although I was surprised that they didn't melt him into little horseshoes at the end of the film.  Of course, that would mean no sequel, wouldn't it?Highly recommended - also I believe it is suitable for kids as there is no huge amount of violence nor nudity (unless you count the Invisible Girl...of course she was invisible!)",Fantastic Four
567396,"This DVD rental was such a surprise delight.  Frederic Fonteyne has directed ""Gillie's Wife,"" but I've never focused on him as a director.  The premise is fairly simple: a man and woman answer each other's personal ad.  They meet strictly for sex.  While I have only seen the U.S. DVD, it certainly is not ""pornographic,"" as the French title might suggest.  There is nearly no nudity in the film.  The cinematic tension comes as Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez, who both won Best Actor awards at the Venice Film Festival for their work, steam the screen with their emotional tension and desire.  Free from the encumbrances of the outside world, the couple focuses solely on each other: their needs, desires and pleasure.  In this aspect, the film seems uniquely French.  Both actors are celebrated in Europe.  Baye won four Cesar Awards in France including ""Le Petit Lieutenant"" in 2006.  Lopez won the Cesar for ""Harry un ami qui vous veut du bien,"" or as it was titled in one English release ""Harry, He's Here to Help.""  There is a beauiful cameo by Sylvie Van den Elsen as Madame Lignaux.  The couple meet her as her husband runs into them at the hotel and dies of an apparent heart attack.  In his dying scene, he tells them that he can't stand his wife and has left her.  Van den Elsen seems self-controlled as they converse in a cafe.  Later, they read of her suicide.  The film speaks volumes to me about the relationship between men and women.  ""You can't live with them, can't live without them.""  Ultimately, the success or failure of relationships is facilitated or doomed by the quality and honesty of their communication on physical, intellectual and value levels.  Had this been a Hollywood picture, corporate would have insisted the couple get together in the final frame.  This is a picture that is well done with two stunning performances by Lopez and Baye.

He gets in trouble with authority but doesn't heed the warnings until he is finally 'dealt with' by the powers that be. At the end of the film, we see a frightened but not cowed teenager who must face punishment for his crimes. I remember seeing this film when it aired on Channel 4 in the UK in the 1980s. At the time, it had a big impact on me as I was a teenager myself. Down through the years it is still being hailed as a very important piece of work regarding its social commentary and is mentioned in the same breath as Alan Clarke's other play 'Scum'. It also bears striking similarities to Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' and Shane Meadows' new film 'This Is England'.The best part of this film is the performance of Tim Roth who showed his talent at a young age in this his first major film.

1034901,"Nine seasons of South Park and the brainchild of Matt Stone and Trey Parker is still going strong.  The animated show of bawdy lunacy continues to push forward in it's ninth season, however, we kind of get off to a rocky start.  In the season premiere, ""Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina"", Mr. Garrison gets a sex-change operation, and Kyle attempts to undergo a procedure to turn into an African American to make the basketball team.  While this episode has it's moments, for the most part it's not as funny as one would hope or think.  The next few episodes, including ""Wing"", ""Erection Day"", and ""Ginger Kids"" follow this same path, but thankfully the good outweighs the bad here.  ""Best Friends Forever"" finds Kenny obsessed with his new PSP; so much so that it ends up getting him killed and helping Heaven beat Hell in an apocalyptic battle.  ""The Losing Edge"", ""Marjorine"", ""Follow That Egg"", and ""Free Willyx"" are when the season hits it's stride thanks to the same formula that helped the show become such a smash: it's at it's best when it's kids being kids.  This season also had a heaping of controversey, most notably from Tom Cruise thanks to ""Trapped in the Closet"" which saw a look at Scientology, and the aforementioned celebrity's refusal to leave a certain part of Stan's room.  ""Bloody Mary"" also saw an outcry from the Catholics involving a bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary, and that's as far as I'll go from there.  Despite it's rocky beginning, the ninth season of South Park is what you'd come to expect from the long running series in terms of laughs and gags, but one has to wonder if the creators are losing their touch a bit now that the show has reached the ten year mark (and quite a few episodes from the first run of the tenth season are sadly among the worst of the series), which would be a crying shame to say the least.

But the end result was too much of a joke to even dismiss as ""It's so bad it's good"".The plot is a convoluted mess failing to properly mix elements of Greek mythology, Hunnic history, and Christianity in an abortion of a myth involving a Celtic-looking Attila digging up a rusty sword and making an offering to Satan to make him a god and make his sword make him invincible.  For some reason, Satan has Cerberus guard the sword and Attila's corpse in hell.Then it extends into modern times, with a plot so poorly thought out using modern ideas like ""nukes"" and ransoming nations and drinking beer, you can't help but think someone here was fired from making spaghetti action films in the early 90s.  A rich Asian man hires some empty-headed Americans to steal Attila's breastplate (which amounts to a thin sheet of metal so flimsy it could shatter at any moment) from a museum in some foreign country (as noted by their 'foreign accents').  Because of one of the idiotic American's trigger-happiness, an important potential hostage is killed, and so they have to kidnap another woman and her brother and use them to get to Attila's sword.What little believable plot is left at this point simply fades away as it turns out this Asian guy mysteriously has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and yet plans on using the sword to threaten nations.  The American mercenary who gets the sword starts acting like a drunken idiot, spouting the worst cliche' lines in history and randomly attacking people in some Transylvanian village tavern.The actors are some of the worst pack you're likely to find outside of pornography, and the dialogue would make some porno movies look like Oscar-worthy performances.

Creator Constance Burge started the series on a very high note, making the first 4 seasons brilliant television while after her exit Brad Kern turned the series into a shadow of its former self and the show lost it's edge. Between main characters leaving (Shannen Doherty's Prue) to ridiculous story developments (Nymphs, Spider demons, etc), the show's last 4 seasons were mostly poor and lacked the true depth the series once had. But whatever the case, All 8 seasons can be summed up like this:Season 1 (1998-1999)-It begins when Phoebe Halliwell moves back in with her sisters, Prue and Piper Halliwell. They are 3 normal, everyday sisters who each share a defining personality. Once Phoebe reads the words from the Book of Shadows, they become the Charmed Ones, the most powerful witches in the world. But being Charmed comes with a price when the sisters battle against a variety of warlocks and demons for the first time.

648201,"I first heard about ""The Fountain"" a few years back at San Diego Comic Con. Aronofsky seemed really hyped about it and showed us a few clips. After seeing them I was amazed but confused, and thats how I felt when I viewed the entire film years later, but after thinking about the film and discussing it with some friends I figured it out and I was blown away by its beautiful complexity. ""The Fountain"" follows three story lines. The first is about a scientist whose wife is dieing of brain steam cancer. He spends all of his time devoted to finding a cure but to no avail. The second follows his wife when she takes up a hobbie and writes a book about a conquistador who is sent on a quest to find the fountian of youth for his queen. Her book is played out in live action as she's writing it and provides a really cool tie in to the film. The third story is the strangest. It basiclly watches the scientist as he floats up through space in a big bubble(Stay with me here)while he meditates by a big tree. These three parts intertwine to make one of the most inovative and visually stunning films I've ever seen. It's hard to explain how beautiful the film is and it's honestly one of those ""You have to see it to believe it"" cases. Alot of people who say they didn't like ""The Fountian"" say it's because they didn't understand it. Just because YOU didn't understand dosen't make it bad. ""The Fountain"" needs consentration and dedication but it's a film that will definitely reward you for them. enjoy.",N/A
916693,"This movie is trying way too hard to be clever and stylish.On the clever side, it fails badly with all the logic mistakes. There is no way that any of the FBI trainees could have set up these elaborate traps on the fly. Then, while these are highly trained profilers, once under pressure, they stop doing their highly sophisticated profiler talk and instead fall back into the stereotype Hollywood movie trapped prey behavior of shutting off their brain and just accusing the next person of being the killer without thought or reason.On the stylish side, I thought the soundtrack was getting in the way of making this a serious suspense movie, instead turning it into an MTV extreme sport feature. Val Kilmer and Christian Slater have actually very short appearances in this film, maybe they thought it better to leave the sinking ship. The remaining actors are mostly two-dimensional, and instead of acting scared (which they should have been) or at least disturbed, they mostly go their ways like it is still an exercise and they will come out unscathed.If the traps hadn't been so elaborate (and thus unbelievable), this could have been decent entertainment.  If the music had been more supporting of the moods, the stylish factor would have been adequate. If the actors had been reacting like humans, this could have risen beyond B material.",Mindhunters

1092740,"Well, I'm completely sold now on Judd Apatow. The guy has to be one of most important filmmakers of our day. Among his works, or at least the ones he was directly involved in some way, I'd rank Knocked Up just ahead of 40 Year Old Virgin and just behind Superbad--which is one I'm still laughing about after seeing the other night. This film is very entertaining but it also reveals a great deal about our contemporary love relationships. The interaction between the married couple--Alison Scott's sister and her husband--is ingloriously reflective of many of the relationships that I've observed. Their strained and unique bond will hit home with viewers. It's a situation that many of us find ourselves in nowadays. On the upside for future renters or purchasers, Knocked Up will definitely appeal to both men and women, but its real value lies in its refusal to bow down to political correctness when evaluating the state of romance. Bravo! Keep up the great work, Judd.",Knocked Up
299532,"Note: French with English subtitles.This French language film adaptation of the classic 'Cyrano de Bergerac' released in '90 is without question the most enjoyable 138 minutes in front of the television screen I've experienced in quite some time. Everything about this production is absolute perfection; cinematography, settings, music, screenplay and of course acting.Gerard Depardieu is an unstoppable force of nature as the eloquent but hot-headed Cyrano. He thunders and rages about one moment only to suddenly turn ethereal and wax poetic the next. The lovely Anne Brochet is a wonderful compliment to the blustering Cyrano as his unattainable Roxane and Vincent Perez delivers a strong performance as the handsome but slow tongued Christian.The dialogue is crisp, textured and witty, however if you're French impaired as I am you'll probably have trouble keeping up with the subtitles. But that's OK, you'll just catch the missing parts the next time you watch and you will definitely watch again and again.",N/A

If you've read the Hagakure, then you'll have a deeper appreciation for the moral struggles that the main character, Ghost Dog, faces.  One must remember, throughout, that the Samurai must face death gladly and without fear and that one must, above all, honor one's retainer.  Forest Whitaker does a commendable job throughout and the rest of the cast does a decent job as well.  Most of the characters have some depth and the story is unique.

I'm not even American and I'm a more active democrat than all y'all! The evidence has been placed before the American people yet they have failed to overturn this evil administration that misled the world into a war with Iraq to satisfy their greed and their insatiable craving for oil. When I was a kid I always dreamt of going to America and being part of the American dream but I think I speak for many people when I say that the international community has never had a lower opinion of the United States. To blindly support a dyslexic moron in a presidency that is more focused on robbing poor nations of their resources is not the honorable image of America that I carried in my heart as a child. Now that I am an adult, I am witnessing the rich Republicans sending the poor of their own country to be killed by poor people in other countries, misleading the American public with falsified evidence to support their war machine, blowing up children and civilians in foreign countries in order to gain access to their resources in effect stealing from the people who have nothing while all the time declaring to the world in a self-righteous attitude that the worst is yet to come. America may have accomplished great things in the past when truly great men were elected as their presidents but the fact that the Bush administration is in control of the world's fate even after this documentary has exposed them for the lying bunch of baby-killers that they are should be enough to prove to the world that indeed dark forces are in control of American politics today.",Fahrenheit 9/11

While the story started out well, it ended giving me the same feeling that I had with watching Nic Cage in City of Angels.....I just kinda felt like the characters sucked in ether and stopped participating in the film itself. I get the point of the movie but I don't equate pennance and guilt with walking around beautiful countryside wide eyed and saying very little. And I would never make a confession to someone who held obsessive love for me. Oh well....Overall the film is beautifully shot and the story does start off strongly. for the lay film watcher, i can't recommend this (my mom was very disappointed) but if your a fan of either director I suppose you should add it to yout ouvre of movies by great writers or directors.",Heaven
1099435,"Reed Richards (Gruffud) and Sue Storm (Alba) are getting married, or at least trying to.  Extraterrestrial intervention, in the form of the Silver Surfer (Jones, voice of Fishburne), stops the wedding and threatens the very existence of the Earth.  The Surfer's arrival also awakens Dr. Doom (McMahon), and soon he is helping the Fantastic Four to stop the Surfer, although he has plans of his own.  When the Surfer's master, Galactus, arrives, the Fantastic Four must fight Doom, convince the Surfer that they deserve to live, and stop Galactus from eating the planet.The Fantastic Four are a more light hearted superheroes than the X-Men or Batman, but that is not a bad thing.  Like the first movie, this one is child friendly and entertaining in a lighter way.  The gang from the first movie are all back for a second go at things, and they seem more comfortable in their roles.  The Surfer is a cool looking character that is more than he seems, and the action is a little more impressive this time around.  ""Rise"" does enough things right that the mistakes are easier to take.  The exception might be the anti-climactic ending, but I don't know how that could have been handled differently.

This movie allowed John to be a romantic hero while remaining **John Belushi**.  For those of us who have perceived his sensitivity and sweetness in his other work (see, for example, the SNL ""Laundromat"" sketch with Gilda Radner), the result is convincing and moving.  Unfortunately, in 1981 the majority of Belushi fans appear to have been the kind of people who would rather go to a party with John Blutarsky than have dinner with Ernie Souchak.",Continental Divide
448250,"I was a huge baseball fan when I worked in radio in the Kansas City area during the 70s and 80s when the Royals were a great team to watch.  Part of the joy of watching them play was team leaders like George Brett and Frank White who were so passionate and honest about their love for the game, you couldn't help but enjoy watching them play.  What does this have to do with a romantic comedy about minor leaguers and the absurdities of their team's misadventures in the Carolina league?  Because ultimately, that's what Bull Durham is about - pure passion for baseball.  You see it when Skip and Larry watch Crash Davis rant about being demoted to Class A and threaten to quit, only to turn and ask when batting practice starts.  They're all hooked and no amount of misfortune or indignity will ever separate them from this game and they all know it.  You see it in Annie Savoy whose passion for men and spirituality, as great as they are, are clearly second to her passion for baseball.  You see it in Max Patkin, the 'Clown Prince' who joyously proclaims, ""I love this game"" when talking about his work in a bar.  And you see them all trying to teach it to bonus baby, Nuke LaLoosh.  Yes, the movie has foul language, sex, absurd pranks, and lots of other non-baseball stuff throughout.  But what the movie is actually ABOUT is a pure passion for the game of baseball.  And therein lies its charm.  Bull Durham's essential message is this: whether you're in the bigs or in pee-wee ball, whether you get laid or not, whether you succeed or not, whether you have a crowd watching or not, the game is always there for you.Twice if it's a Sunday double-header.",N/A

The film featured two films ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" both full length films tied together with a slew of hilarious fabricated trailers for other kitschy type films.  The whole production was reminiscent of the 1970's type B film double feature.""Planet Terror"", directed by Rodriguez featured among others Bruce Willis, Michael Biehn, one legged stripper Rosie McGowan and martial arts and weapons expert Freddy Rodriguez.  The film chronicled the outbreak of a plague in a small Texas town courtesy of stolen bioweapons that turned those exposed into flesh eating zombies.""Death Proof"" featured Kurt Russell as the psychopathic Stuntman Mike who had a penchant for killing beautiful women through vehicular homicide.  Tarantino fond of suggestive sexuality studded this feature which he directed with attractive babes featuring Rosario Dawson, McGowan again and others.While the three hour plus double feature was lengthy and the second feature ""Death Proof"" tended to be a tad redundant with a very long and dangerous car chase scene, the overall experience was a refreshing and different cinema experience.",N/A

741697,"It's the latter half of the twentieth century, and hi-tech humanoid robots called ""Boomers"" have freed the citizens of MegaTokyo from all types of drudgery.  Unfortunately, cheap Boomers often go haywire, and when they do, the city calls on the Special Felony Crimes Elite Team known as the AD Police.  And when things get too hot for even the AD Police force to handle, they call on the hardsuited ladies of the Knight Sabers: Sylia, Priss, Linna and Nene.  Their story is told in this exciting three-chapter saga...which is entitled `Bubblegum Crash' despite the fact that it has nothing whatsoever to do with bubblegum.  As you probably already know, `Crash' is the sequel to `Crisis' (seeBubblegum Crisis: Remastered Edition)...and that didn't involve bubblegum either.In the first episode, red-eyed Colonel Lando and his `Illegal Army' of power-suited mercenaries rob the Groly Bank of thirty billion dollars' worth of gold bullion after mercilessly cutting down Bogarde the Boomer in a hail of blue machinegun fire.  The AD Police are powerless against the gang's military mobile suits because their stubborn new Chief refuses to approve the use of heavy equipment due to the risk of civilian casualties.  So, officers Leon and Daley hang out at the local diner, where the cute Boomer waitress serves up a mean cup of coffee--literally!  ""Even though they look like human beings,"" Leon complains, ""they've got no more brains that an orangutan!""  Meanwhile, Priss is in the recording studio working on her debut album while very effectively fending off unwanted advances from her amorous, goateed producer.  Linna has given up aerobics for a lucrative position at a securities firm.  And ""little miss cyberpunk,"" Nene, is busy at her computer digging up data on Lando and his power-suit army, and tearfully dreading the possible break-up of the Knight Sabers in the wake of team-leader Sylia's unexplained absence.Part 2, `Geo Climbers,' centers around the irascible Priss and her unrelenting anti-Boomer sentiments.  ""I hate Boomers and all the jerks that make `em,"" she proclaims.  The motorcycling singer's prejudice is challenged when she looses a game of rock-scissor-paper to Linna and Nene, and is sent into the sewers to rescue Adama, a noble second-generation Boomer falsely accused of a brutal murder at the laboratory where he was assembled.  Although he has no moving mouth parts, Adama possesses a special AI that gives him a conversational ability indistinguishable from that of a human (aside from the metallic echo).  Together, Priss and Adama must battle the fiendish Dr. Yuri's collection of ruthless, heavily-armed combat Boomers on their way to Geo City, while ignoring the MC Hammer video playing on the huge outdoor TV screen.The trilogy comes to a thrilling conclusion in `Meltdown,' as DJ Tommy, the Max Headroom-inspired newsman, reports on the city's latest Boomer riot.  Construction Boomers are going berserk after having their batteries recharged, yelling, ""All power to the Boomer revolution!"" before smashing everything around them to crumpled bits and tossing massive I beams through car windshields.  Garbage collecting Boomers are throwing dumpsters at terrified citizens, and that cute Boomer waitress is making her coffee meaner than ever!  The AD Police force is swamped with Boomer complaints, and before they can even think about taking action, a trio of angry military combat Boomers has plowed through their headquarters in an enormous truck.  The maniacal malfunctioning machines are headed straight for the armory, intent on blowing the Advanced Police building to smithereens!  ""Knight Sabers, it's showtime!""`Bubblegum Crash' may not be as great as its predecessor, but it's still great...with appealing animation, a stylish opening montage, slick mecha designs, and lots of ""totally faboo"" music, sung in both Japanese and English.

1070951,"Just finished the second season of Rome from HBO, which is historical fiction version of the time period following Julius Caesar's death, as opposed to Season One of this same series, which chronicles the ascension and eventual death of Julius.Like the first season, it is lavishly put together TV show, more sophisticated sets. costumes, etc. then most movies.  Historical purists will probably quibble with some of the elements of the show, although I would like to point out that A - at least they tried very hard to base the plot on historical text, B - the historical texts of the period are sometimes vague and conflicting and C - the show's producers nailed Roman culture and thinking of the late republic dead on.  (As one of the commentaries mentions, historians might not like this show, but classicists do).  There is also a subtle but strong morality discussion running through the entire series (this review title comes from a short dialogue between Cleopatra and Pullo, which comes close to summing up the series in a sentence)This is a hard show to stop watching once you start.  There are not a ton of DVD extras, the commentaries are OK, the ""All Roads Lead to Rome"" feature is nice, and there are a few featurettes of varying quality.  Mostly, you should get this DVD so you can plow through the whole thing in a week!This is probably a no-brainer for most Amazon readers, but please please please watch season one first - the Atia/Octavian/Octavia relationship and the Pullo/Vorenus duo is much more interesting to watch.",Rome:S2 (DVD)

Any questions? 4/10(United States Championship)Chris Benoit vs MVP: MVP? M-V-P? MMMMMMMVVVVVVPPPPPP?.......Nope, no matter how you say it, that word just doesn't belong at Wrestlemania. Regardless of how bad the idea was, a good performance by MVP. He really stepped up at Wrestlemania. Perhaps he has a future as a main eventer (ha!). Seriously, see this instead of going to the bathroom. It's pretty good. After the last match, anything looks good. 7.5/10(World Heavyweight Championship)Batista vs Undertaker: Many were unhappy about this not being the main event. But c'mon, Raw always gets the main event. ALWAYS. But I'm actually rather happy this was mid card. It added balance to the placement of the matches and kept the crowd on their toes. Slower and shorter than it could've been, but hey how can you complain in a match with Undertaker? You can't. End of story. 8.5/10ECW Originals vs The New Breed: I was really looking forward to this match but then. I asked myself....No Hardcore? No eliminations? No stipulations whatsoever? No excitement from the crowd? No high flying moves? No suspense? No longer than 5 minutes?......... NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! 5.5/10(Hair vs Hair Match)Mr McMahon vs Donald Trump: 2 billionaires go at it. The loser gets his head shaved. Hm.Too much publicity for this match gave you an extremely empty feeling at the end, but this match still hides the fact that most of the other matches stink. They sure got us. Hooray for shifty marketing schemes!!!! 8/10(Women's Championship Lumberjill Match)Melina vs Ashley: This match has nothing, or does it? At least Ashley would make a better champi......Well, at least they added the lumberjills to t... Well, at least it was only 3 minu.....This match has nothing. 2/10(WWE Championship)John Cena vs Shawn Michaels: This was great. A great bout between 2 great competitors. They both put their heart and soul into it, something rarely seen in most matches today. Honestly, the right man won. Best main event of the past 3 Wrestlemanias. 9.5/10Overall: Too much hype went into this Wrestlemania. The fact that it was being held in Detriot (same spot as Wrestlemania 3) automatically meant it had to be the most spectacular Wrestlemania of all time. Yeah right. This was plain and simply, a good PPV. Nothing more, nothing less. Sure they could've made a tag team match(Brian and Paul)as well as other matches with different combinations of superstars. But they put on a great show and worked with what they had. It was a great, but not spectacular. What can I say? It's WRESTLEMANIA!!!!!!! 8.5/10",N/A

This picture's still the snoozer it's always been, with the usually reliable Michael Caine dull as dishwater here.  Leading lady Giovanna Ralli is lovely, and nearly unintelligible; sounds like she's made a valiant stab at learning English phonetically.  At that, she beats the dire Nanette Newman, the exceptionally untalented Mrs. Forbes, who's unfortunately thrust front and center in his films of this period.  Here, she's easily the world's least enticing starlet, cavorting around behind her usual filters playing her usual ingenue that she's a good fifteen years past (no, no, Nanette!)

1027494,"Gruberova waited long before tackling Norma on stage, and this DVD confirms that the wait has been worth it. Having released a concert performance on CD which was recorded in 2005, her first staged performances were recorded by UNITEL in January/February 2006 at the Bayerische Staatsoper. I must admit that looking at Gruberova, one sees an older woman, which is obvious, given that she was almost 60 at the time of this recording. However, age has not seemed to have taken its toll too heavily on her vocal resources. It was probably the need to rise to the occasion that made this recording all the more special. Munich assembled an outstanding supporting cast and Haider, ever the loving and sympathetic conductor, allowed his wife to shine. His interpretation of Bellini's score is, in my opinion flawless and even better than the CD recording. The audience love Gruberova and the performance is one to listen to over and over again. This will probably be the ideal performance for many, however, Jurgen Rose's sets, costumes and direction will disappoint those who prefer a more traditionlist approach to the opera, with a minimal set and the chorus flasing guns at certain moments. Musically, there are no cuts and Gruberova sings Casta Diva in G, as well as both verses of of her ensuing cabaletta. Mira o Norma, with a wonderul Ganassi as Adalgisa, is sung in the high key, with both voices blending beautifully. Todorovich bawls his way a bit through the ungrateful role of Pollione and Scandiuzzi is sonorous as Oroveso. There is even an 11 minute feature on the making of the production, as well as short interviews with the stars. With superb DTS sound and picture in high definition colour, this is one DVD I have and will return to many times over!",Bellini - Norma

The film pulled me in from the start, however, I'm going to have to review the time sequence better (I did find that the only issue that prevented me from giving 5 stars after first watch.) As an adoptee myself, I always find it interesting to see how other men handle the issue. (I have not been interested in finding the birth mother.) The story wreaks of what I think is wrong with the south and this nation at the moment - the religious element is of little use to human kind when used against others.Performances were excellent across the board and I think with the exception of Chris Sarandon's character the others seemed like people I'd like to meet.

There are not many films that explore the quiet desperation of a family's crisis (or should I say any relationship's crisis) with such honesty, poignancy, and subtlety.

The MTM show is considered one of the top TV comedies of all time and has the number one ranked episode of all time in a TV Guide poll (""Chuckles Bites the Dust"") in Season 6.The MTM show is so enmeshed in culture that the theme song is in use in two commercials right now and the cast got a standing ovation at last year's Emmy Awards.

552554,"This is an unbelievable collection of performance footage from some of the greatest singers of all time.  I am very grateful to NVC Arts/Warner Music Vision for producing and distributing this DVD. Whether you are an opera singer or an opera lover (or both!), you will love this DVD.  This DVD has rare footage that you are not likely to see anywhere else.  I particularly recommend this DVD to opera students, as there is so much to be learned from watching and listening to these elite singers, not to mention the insightful commentary from Magda Olivero, Thomas Hampson, and others.There are 28 artists featured here, and the DVD runs for almost 2 hours.  Virtually everything in this DVD was enjoyable, so comments on each and every section would make this review very lengthy indeed.  Thus, I'll stick to my favorite sections.I loved the footage of Enrico Caruso from the early 20th century.  It is entirely fitting to begin this DVD with opera's first true superstar.  I really enjoyed the commentary of Magda Olivero in the features of Beniamino Gigli and Tito Schipa.  She is incredibly charming and insightful.  Of course, the peformance footage of these two phenomenal tenors is fantastic, with Gigli singing ""Ombra mai fu"" from Xerxes, and Schipa singing ""M'appari"" from Martha.  There is the ONLY footage of legendary Luisa Tetrazzini.  She is at a retirement party (age 61), and singing along to a recording of Caruso singing ""M'appari"".  It is poignant.There is rare footage of Rosa Ponselle.  You get to see her MGM screen tests, singing ""Chanson Boheme"" and the ""Habanera"" from Carmen.  She pulls off very committed performances, even though she was all alone in front of the camera.  She was 21 at the time, beautiful, and in great voice.  You get Kirsten Flagstad singing ""Hojotoho!"" from ""Die Walkure"" in a live performance from 1938 introduced by Bob Hope, and accompanied by the Met orchestra.Being a big ""La Boheme"" fan, I was flabbergasted to see a live peformance of the final scene from Act I, sung by the dream team of Renata Tebaldi and Jussi Bjorling.  It was a live broadcast in 1956, and they were both fabulous.The DVD ends with some legendary Maria Callas performances.  You get a clip of the duet ""Parigi, o cara"" from the famous 1958 Lisbon ""La Traviata"", sung with Alfredo Kraus.  Then, you get the duet and ""Vissi d'arte"" from the equally famous 1964 Covent Garden performance of ""Tosca"" with Tito Gobbi.  There is intermittent commentary from Nicola Rescigno.  Callas was an amazing performer.In addition to the above, there is some wonderful footage of Martinelli, de Luca, Tauber, Tibbett, Stevens, de Los Angeles, Sutherland, Price, Olivero, Corelli, Vickers, and more. This is a true cornucopia of operatic legends.Highly recommended.",N/A

255021,"Like most folks, I had very high hopes for this film, definitely after the loosely connected 3-movie story arc preceeding it.  This movie didn't have the punch nor leave the audience with the typical satisfactory feeling afterwards.  I despised the use of an otherwise talented and beloved supporting cast for comical relief.  Instead of allowing the secondary characters a real chance to run, it resorted to sight gags and pretty much made them look like buffoons, and Shatner clearly didn't rectify the more-embarrassing moments.  However, that being said, the film show several wonderful moments..:1) LOVED the campfire scenes both at the beginning and end, effectively bracketing the film's story in a poignant way.  Why couldn't you have had moments like these for the secondary characters??? ~ They are seasoned ACTORS for heaven's sake..!  After how many movies and episodes, not only are they relegated to remain as secondaries, but treated with even less respectful screentime. Again, warm moments you WISHED they did more on the big screen ~ Taking time out to EXPLORE these characters and what makes them tick together, after all these voyages.  Without families, who have they really become..?2) Loved the horseback and wilderness scene's overall.  Gave the normally 'sterile' starship crew a more beneficial and agreeable backdrop to work against.3) Despite the lack of good effects, the Kirk/Spock interplay at the end was excellent ('Spock, not in front of the Klingons...').  It helps to make up for the heavy-handed 'I-need-my-pain' message you had to slog through.The Sybok character was entirely miscast and misdirected..  Who would believe he would be a Vulcan, even Spock's half-brother, raised by Surak...?  Terribly chemistry between him and the stars.  Granted he was no Khan, but a more cerebral and reserved, less jovial approach would have made for better and conflict with depth.

With nothing else to do, he moves in with his grandmother and becomes involved with the family across the street, which includes an unhappily-married mother (Meg Ryan) and an angst-filled teenage daughter (Kristen Stewart).The pop soundtrack and the gorgeous neighborhood where the movie was filmed are highlights of this movie; the woodsy setting is a perfect place for love to bloom.  Well, something blooms between Carter and the mother and the daughter, but it's not quite love and not quite anything else.  Adam Brody (playing a calmer version of his quirky Seth from ""The OC"") is too low-key to be a leading man (at least with this script).  He fades into the background while Meg Ryan's needy wife takes center stage - but she doesn't grab our hearts, either.  She looks too young for the part.  Her character goes through a lot, but unfortunately, the story never quite hits a home run in the emotions department.  It comes close, but falls short of real poignancy, which is not only a shame, it's  surprising, considering it's a story about heartbreak, cancer, and death.All in all, it's on a par with a big-budget TV-movie; OK, but not memorable.",N/A
893099,"A great problem with Shakespeare comedies is that they are difficult to translate to the big screen. Whilst MOV is not, strictly speaking, a comedy perhaps (not sure if Ben Johnson classified it as such), it nevertheless is imbued with much comedy. The casket scenes with the unsuitable suitors, for example, offers an obvious occasion for humour as does the denouement - portia and nerissa's discovery of the traded rings.This film adapation of MoV provides an example of the difficulties of transferring Shakespearean stage humour to the big screen - just the 'being there' element in theatre is a property essential to comedic tension which film adaptations lack.For what this film version of MoV lacks in terms of the delivery of comedy, dramatically and visually speaking this film version is a treat - particularly in the courtroom scene while Pacino and Irons as the play's perhaps two most important characters are in fine form.Al Pacino's shylock interpretation is played as a particularly miserable usurer Jew: an embittered wretch moulded by Venetian cruelty and oppression. His bargaining for the pound of flesh at the beginning of the play is suitably ambiguous regarding whether or not it is intended to be taken seriously and whether or not his offer to Antonio is in fact an act of generosity given that the loan, if repaid in time, would be interest free.In this particular characterization of Shylock it is easy to sympathize with the character's need for revenge given that which befalls him thereafter, but his seeming complete inability to forgive during the courtroom scene makes us rather side with the ostensibly more merciful venetians again...until they decide to completely humiliate him and take half what he owns and forcibly convert him to Christianity. This sanctinomous treatment is suitably manifest in this film production with Portia shown to be the main instigator of a fairly aggressive form of Venetian justice.The juxtaposition of Antonio and Shylock as extreme examples of venetian society is also clearly in evidence here. The former symbolizes unbounded generosity, even beyond his means; the latter symbolizes extreme tightness with all things monetary; both, however, are clearly afflicted with weltschmerz perhaps owing to their inability to find some measure of acceptance for that which represents the opposite to which they value most.In this sense the friction between the two values, necessary for any democratic society to be functional and viable, is clearly expressed. The miserly and uncompromising usurer depends on the merchant, the unconditionally generous libertine merchant depends on the usurer, and the entire superficial liberal ethos of the rest of society depends on both - the scapegoat and the martyr.The denouement is done well enough although, consistent with the general lack throughout the film, is short on comedy. We understand well enough the need for the new generation of venetians to grow to embrace the responsibility that is required of a democratic, open society in order for it to remain viable - a theme clearly resonant for modern western societies.",William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice

232551,"The casting, acting, and visual surroundings are superb. One scene in particular stays with me: Aschenbach has seated himself so that he can compose music while looking at the boy (and we hear the Mahler he is composing, and the human singing comes in).What I don't understand is Aschenbach's interior silence. The story (Thomas Mann's) is told by a narrator, but Thomas Mann hardly ever created a principle character who wasn't full of recordable thoughts and feelings, and Aschenbach is not that exception. Aschenbach quotes (and misquotes!) authors in his head, has recorded thoughts, scraps of thoughts, feelings, scraps of feelings, which grow ever more intense, continually. I can only assume that Visconti, working in a visual medium, wanted to substitute Bogarde's face for what we read on the page. Although this is sometimes successful, it also accounts for the few negative reviews this film got--mostly due to not enough going on. Bogarde's face is wonderful, but Thomas Mann is a little more wonderful.But STILL...5 stars.***""Mr. Bogarde, you have your rings mixed up.""(wriggling his fingers) ""No, I don't.""""A wedding band goes on the fourth finger of your left hand, not right.""""Not if you're a German in 1911, it doesn't.""""

This director does not object.""***The three (or four--depending if you want to separate the prositute's name from her appearance and behavior, in a real or imagined flashback [probably real])references, or borrowings, from Doctor Faustus make me a little dizzy.

( The whistling in an audience in Germany means---I hate it.) Strauss's ""Salome,"" much more daring, was a smashing success in 1905 (and 6). Nor can I make much of Aschenbach's friend's castigation after the hall has cleared and they are back in Aschenbach's room.

Though V himself is taking personal revenge in the way of killing the leaders in control, his appeal to people is not one of violence. He appeals to people to wake up from their slumber and stand up against the endless lies and brutality of the regime. That this is the message is clearly seen in his speeches as well as the way in which the people respond to it.The scene at the end of the film where thousands of people, young and old march unarmed, hand in hand against the oppressors and the troops, is an extremely powerful message and reminiscent of the power of Gandhi's message of non-violence and civil disobedience.As this non-violent uprising culminates in the film on the 5th of November, it is a timely reminder to go out and buy this video and let the message sink in.As a follow up reading ""1984"" by George Orwell, is eerily close in describing the fascist society that is shown in the film and sadly also close to the way things are going. The book ""Political Ponerology"" is another recommendable book that details the process by which a society gets to become a totalitarian state.",N/A
484422,"Ah, The Fly!  We all know it and love it, don't we?  It's the story of a scientist, Andre Delambre, who creates a teleportation device(here called a disintegrator/reintegrator).  It seems to work like a charm, but there are a few...bugs to work out(sorry I couldn't help it).  When he tries teleporting himself, he's unaware of a houselfy that snuck into the machine with him.  They get scrambled and Delambre is left with a fly head and arm.  The housefly is left with Delambre's human head and arm.  I'm no expert in science, but I highly doubt that switching heads with a fly would mean that the fly head would become human size and the human head would shrink.  But who cares, it's all in good fun.  The murderous fly instincts slowly start to overcome Delambre and he must find his smaller counterpart to reverse the process.  When all else fails, he decides to destroy himself and his work with the help of his wife.  The movie is told from the wife's point of view as she tells her story to her brother in law, Francois(Vincent Price!) and a police detective.  A great classic sci-fi film that manages not to be as corny as you might think.  Good acting all around and a pretty decent looking fly getup.  Includes the famous ""Help me!"" scene.Next up....it's The Return of the Fly....with Vincent Price...You guinea pig...yeah, Return of the Flyyyyyy.  Sorry, I couldn't resist adding a little Misfits to the mix.  The Fly isn't a film that needed a sequel considering the whole premise was based on a random occurrence and a case of really bad luck.  It's still good though.  Andre's son, Phillippe is working on a teleportation device of his own(how convenient!)against the wishes of his uncle, Francois(Price again).  A doublecrossing partner lands Phillipe in the machine with....you guessed it....a fly(what are the odds of that, eh?).  Phillipe emerges as a homicidal fly headed monster, and once again the race is on to find the smaller counterpart before one of them dies.  Though fun, this one's a bit sillier.  It's more of a creature feature and has a been there/done that feeling.  The fly head is also quite laughable because it's jumbo sized this time.  Price is excellent as always.  Even when Price is cast in a silly movie, he never acts like he is.Finally we got the Curse of the Fly.  This movie is much cooler than it's reputation would have you think.  The third generation of Delambres(two grandsons and their father.  Yes, the genealogy doesn't make too much sense) have nearly perfected the teleportation machine.  They have a setup in Quebec that can teleport them to London.  These Delambres should know by now not to mess with this teleportation crap anymore, but you know how movie scientists are.  Just ask Victor Frankenstein's two sons.  One of the grandsons gets smitten with an escapee mental patient he runs into and soon brings her home.  This doesn't sit well with dad who doesn't want the secret of their work leaked out to anybody.  Dad and son keep the failures of their experiments locked in a building near the house.  These are mutated and scarred humans.  Everything goes to hell when the son decides to tell his wife everything.  Plus the police are closing in.  The grandson in London is also fed up with whole thing.  And the mutants are restless!  It all ends with a neat twist.  Needless to say this one was different than the first two.  It wasn't great, but I admire the effort to take it in a different direction.  They could've easily(and stupidly) rehashed everything with a story about a Delambre somehow getting trapped in the machine with a fly again.As stated before, the picture quality on these discs is great.  The commentary is informative, the documentary on Price is informative, and the packaging is awesome.  There's no reason whatsoever not to pick this up if you love these movies.  Hell, it's worth getting if you've only seen the first one.",The Fly / Return of the Fly
1082331,"When watching what the Masters of Horror collection has to offer, I really don't set the bar high. The thing they are trying to accompish it quite amazing, and the fact that I can buy the series for a good price is really beautiful. I honestly just need a few jumps to keep me guessing, maybe some laughs if they are going for comedy in the gore, and a little cohesiveness when it comes to the storyline. When I started watching Valerie on the Stairs I thought I was going to get that, too, but as I journeyed further into the abyss I began to realize that this wasn't one of the good or even the middle-ground episodes.No, it was really bad.Basically, we have the story of a writer who moves into this creepy place subbing as a haven for wannabe writers, and the writer begins hearing things that are, well, haunting. Soon after getting settled (if putting some of your stuff down and pecking at a typewriter getting settled) he sees something rather terrible/erotic; he hears some noise and goes to check on it and sees that there's a naked woman settled on the staircase outside just before she is dragged into the shadows by the hands of something bestial. If you haven't guessed, her name is Valerie, and the premise sounds enticing.For a few moments the movie is, too, and makes you think you've stuck gold.Sadly, like a child with a handful of pyrite, you soon realize that the cinema gods have duped you.The problem with the Valerie, aside from the fact that much of it is determined to be a softcore skin flick, is the fact that it doesn't maintain its edge. At first it starts out sharp, creepy even, but it looses that rather quickly and makes you wonder why. It honestly felt like it had been written well at first, almost like there was effort at the start, but then someone had gotten bored and had constructed the end on a bender. Strangely, it wasn't the acting or the effects or even the location that hurt the movie. It was simply the storyline and the direction that made this one a sure miss.The only people I would say that need to see this are perhaps horror wachers with lots of B-movie needs, hardcore fans of the Masters of Horror series, and perhaps people making a movie who need something to study on what ""not to do."" I would try to talk them out of it, too, but people have to do what people have to do. I guess I can understand that - I had to see it for myself and had the same type of warning.This is a not recommended and then some - sadly, I might add.

55498,"This film is perhaps the only one where Kubrick did not have his oh-so-important ""absolute control"" and it is the better for it. Don't get me wrong, Kubrick was an outstanding director and his films from the 1960s and 1970s are all excellent, but in case of ""Spartacus"", the vivacity of the film is largely due to the fact that behind the scenes there was a similar clash of egos, talents, and opinions. While this might sound like a recipe for disaster, the wonderful script somehow gives this movie coherence.It cannot be said that this film is particularly historically accurate, but then again the purpose of art is to create something beautiful out of the fragments of a flawed reality, and this is certainly achieved here. Artistic truth can trump historical truth sometimes, if the artistic truth has something important to say about the human condition.What the artistic truth seems to say here is that Spartacus, as valid as his struggle was, simply came at a very unfortunate time for his quest and that his Hamlet-esque inner turmoil doomed him in the end. He simply should have taken Rome when his military power was at its peak and in many ways history might have been quite different (or not). But he did not, and at least in this film, those political power struggles in Rome are what did him in.Besides, the end of the movie -- if there is anything modern directors can learn from these old epics is how important it is to wrap the plot up in a way that does justice to the scale of the film. If you watch a three-hour movie, you expect a momentous denouement. And in Spartacus, the denouement fills the last 30 minutes or more (everything after the ""I'm Spartacus"" scene is basically part of it). It is the mother of all endings, an unrelenting tear jerker that manipulates you as hard as possible, and that is a very good thing in this case, for if this ending were not there, the whole movie that had gone before would have been cheapened.And yes, that spitting-and-punching scene (you will know what I mean) works, because it shows how powerless both Spartacus and Crassus are in a way. They can fight the other side, yet it will never go away, because their conflict mirrors an eternal conflict between the powerful few and the powerless many that has been going on throughout history, or at least since Roman times. And that enrages them enough that they fly off the handle in (almost) private.I also find the self-important opening narration about how slavery was ""abolished"" two thousand years later fairly funny. Oh really? I think there  are plenty of people in third-world countries working without any safety precautions, exposed to harmful chemicals, with low pay, under horrible conditions on plantations etc. who would mightily object to that assertion. Not even to mention ""wage slaves"", those who may be free in theory to do what they want but have only the exciting career path of burger-flipping open to them in practice. Slavery by any other name indeed.But as far as Roman epics go, this is still my favorite. ""Gladiator"" was the slightly demented version of this (where ""oooh, look at the suggested incest"" replaced the ""ooh, look at the suggested homosexuality"" in this version), but generally the dumbing-down of the intellectual level of movie scripts since then has made it impossible for a similar effort to surface. Besides, today it would be very difficult to find actors like Laughton and Olivier who can carry this kind of movie. And maybe that's a good thing, because some things cannot be improved upon.

1103912,"Time to rejoice, the original counter-culture Classic TV Police Series phenomenon that remains an iconic favorite, replete with one of the best and most memorable TV musical themes ever composed, will at along last be released on DVD in season boxed sets. Can you dig it?Season 1 Set 1 will include the first 13 episodes and is expected to include interviews with the cast.Premiering Sept. 24, 1968, during the height of the Viet Nam War and Civil Rights Movement, Mod Squad lasted for five action packed seasons with episodes that dealt as much with social issues as it did crime in the streets.Set in Los Angeles, the premiss was simple enough: Three young people in trouble with the law are given the opportunity of avoiding jail sentences by infiltrating the counter-culture as undercover cops and exposing criminal who prey on youth. The idea is for them to bridge the generation gap between the youth and the ""fuzz.""The three ""delinquents"" were Pete Cochran, portrayed by Michael Cole, who was arrested for car theft; Julie Barnes, portrayed by Peggy Lipton, who ran away from her prostitute mother in San Francisco; and Lincoln Hayes, portrayed by Clarence Williams III, who was arrested during the Watts riots. Tough talking Capt. Adam Greer, portrayed by Tige Andrews, was in charge of the special squad and eventually became a father-figure to them. (Lipton, who later played Norma the waitress in another cult classic -  Twin Peaks -  was nominated for an Emmy for her role as Julie, and won a Golden Globe in 1970 for her portrayal of the character.)In the series, Cochran drove an old green ""woody"" side-paneled stationwagon that became a lasting symbol of the show, along with cooooool bell-bottomed pants! Sadly, the wheels were destroyed in the second season when the car was set ablaze by an arsonist.The stellar series spawned a block-buster movie in the 1990's that was horrible by comparison, failing in all respects to capture the chemistry and remarkably innocent sincerity of the original.Included in this set are the first 13 of the 26 episodes that comprised the first season: Teeth of the Barracuda: Bad Man on Campus; What a Pretty Bus; When Smitty Comes Marching Home; You Can't Tell the Players Without a Programmer; A Time to Love, A Time to Cry; Find Tara Chapman; The Price of Terror; A Quiet Weekend in the Country; Love; Twinkle, Twinkle Little Starlet;  and The Guru.Episodes expected in the Season 1 Volume 2 DVD set are: The Sunday Drivers; Hello Mother, My Name is Julie; Flight Five Doesn't Answer; Shell Game; Fear is the Bucking Horse; A Hint of Darkness, A Hint of Light; The Uptight Town; A Reign of Guns; A Run for the Money; Child of Sorrow, Child of Light; Keep the Faith, Baby; Captain Greer, Call Surgery; Peace Now - Arly Blau; and A Seat by the Window.Created by the legendary TV mogul Aaron Spelling, he produced it along with Danny Thomas and Sheldon Leonard.

378873,"The Mangler's not one of the more popular King adaptations.  The inspiration for King's story most likely was how nasty it would be if someone actually got caught in one of those steam irons.  It certainly would be a horrific scene, but as nasty as that is, it's not a concept you can really make a feature film around.  That's probably why King wrote it as a short story.  Stretching the short story into a feature length film requires much more plot to be added(the short story may have had a half hour worth of film material, tops).  Alot of folks who bash this film usually have something along the lines of....""With the talent involved, how could it be this bad?""...to say.  Well, most horror fans have a hard time admitting to themselves that since Texas Chainsaw, Tobe Hooper has become increasingly schlocky as the years go by.  We all know it, we just don't say it.  Englund hasn't always made the best stuff, and not every King story is a winner.  In The Mangler, Hooper is trying to actually make the film scary.  The tone is much more serious than subject matter like this should be.  Sure, the first scene where the machine claims it's first victim is effective, but by the time you reach two grown men performing an exorcism on a laundry folder, and then having the machine turn into a Lovecraftian monster, it's just too damn silly.  So why the four stars?  Well, I actually do enjoy this movie quite a bit.  If you want to view this with the intention of getting your pants scared off, it'll fail.  If you view The Mangler as drive-in fare, it's fun.  It's got some nasty gore, an over the top villain played by Robert Englund, funny lines(both intentional and unintentional), and the film is actually shot very well.  As others have stated, the acting is hammy, particularly in Englund's case.  However, certain mention should go to Ted ""wasn't she a great big fat person"" Levine.  The film is practically a showcase for Levine's odd performance.  Is he being campy and over the top?  Is he serious and coming off as goofy?  It's hard to tell for sure, but he's always amusing and never boring to watch.  I think the guy's actually a good actor and it was cool to see him in a leading role.  If this were made today, it'd be Orlando Friggin' Bloom or some other schmuck that's mistaken for a good actor.  My disappointment with this dvd is that it's the theatrical R-rated version.  One of the special features shows a split-screen comparisson of the R and unrated versions.  Why the hell not just put those snippets back in the movie?  Especially in these days where studios are so ""unrated"" hogwild.  I'm surprised we didn't see an unrated version of Happy Feet when it csme out on dvd.  I used to have a vhs copy of this movie, and it was the unrated version with the extra nastiness.  So, I know it can be done.  The deleted bits are quick gore shots that actually do enhance the scenes and make them much nastier.  But anyhow, I do actually think this is a pretty fun movie...depending on how you look at it,that is.",Mangler VHS

198488,"This atmospheric horror film based on the play adaptation of Braum Stoker's literary horror classic, still has enough going for it to make it one of the great films from the early days of talking pictures. Lugosi's portrayel of Dracula may seem a bit ripe at times when viewed today, but it is part of the charm of this horror masterpiece.Producer Carl Laemmle brought director Tod Browning in to film Garrett Fort's script of the play and it proved the perfect choice. Browning gave ""Dracula"" the fog-shrouded look and feel of something evil and not of this world intruding upon the living. Something only wolfbane and a cross can keep at bay.It begins in Transylvania as Renfield (Dwight Frye) is on his way to Count Dracula's castle to have him sign lease papers. He is bewildered by the reaction of peasants when they discover his destination. But it is not long before Dracula (Bela Lugosi) has become his master and he discovers there are far worse things awaiting men than mere death.A chartered ship to England will become a crew of corpses with Renfield doing the bidding of his new master, and in the process slipping into insanity. It is in London that Dracula will meet the lovely Mina (Helen Chandler) and her friend Lucy (Frances Dade), whose fascination with the Count will lead her into a life of the undead.It is Mina Dracula has big plans for, however, only her love John Harker (David Manners) and the intrepid Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) standing between he and the evil which could take Mina into darkness forever. Van Helsing knows that desperate measures must be taken or the two marks on Mina's neck will bring her forever under the spell of Count Dracula.Only a somewhat abrupt ending mars this film classic. Helen Chandler makes a lovely heroine and the atmosphere created by Tod Browning and cinematographer Karl Freund is made for late night viewing with a big bowl of popcorn.

1014926,"""Bewitched"", was one of those special programs that I had the extreme privilege to literally grow up with as a boy. Blessed with one of, if not THE best cast of players in comedy history, terrific writing, imaginative special effects, and most importantly of all heaps of charm, this show was a total winner from episode one. Binding all of this magically together through an amazing 8 seasons was the ever lovely Elizabeth Montgomery as the beautiful suburban housewife witch Samantha. Quite rightly dubbed ""The Grace Kelly of 1960's television"", Montgomery was one of those rare television actresses that only the 1960's decade seemed to be able to produce who totally won everyone's heart. How she never won an Emmy Award for playing Samantha is one of the great mysteries of American Television History . Season Four of ""Bewitched"", is by far my favourite of the whole series and saw the series really peak with the entire cast at their creative best. It was also sadly the last season before Dick York's on-going health problems really began to interfer with the production of ""Bewitched"", prior to his unfortunately having to leave the series near the end of Season Five. Season Four contains a huge host of classic episodes that spotlighted the shows leading players in Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York, and the legendary Agnes Moorehead (another performer who also strangely missed out on winning an Emmy Award for her hilarious playing of the Mother-In-Law from Hell, Endora ), while still giving the wonderful supporting players like Marion Lorne, David White, Mabel Albertson and Bernard Fox real opportunities to shine in various episodes.Every ""Bewitched"", buff has their favourite episodes from this season and I find that season 4 has an abundance of really classic episodes to choose from when compiling lists of favourites. Some of the outstanding ones in my belief are;""Long live the Queen"", a very lavish episode that finds Samantha enthroned as the new Queen of the Witches in a out of this world ceremony. Her new honour however causes numerous problems on the homefront with Darrin.""Double, Double....Toil and Trouble"", where in her latest scheme to get rid of Darrin, Endora gets Serena to masquerade as Samantha for a day causing all kinds of hilarious misunderstandings and the usual bewilderment for Darrin as sweet Samantha suddenly transforms into the raunchy ""Terror of Morning Glory Circle"".""Cheap, Cheap"", where Endora turns Darrin into a terrible penny pinching miser which causes all sorts of complications at a dinner party for an equally ""careful"", client.""A Safe And Sane Halloween"", the best of the Halloween episodes in my belief and a very funny telling of how Tabitha brings to life a number of Halloween characters from one of her books causing mayhem for Darrin and Samantha. This episode taught me as a boy in Australia just how this holiday was celebrated in America, proving that television of all kinds can ""educate"".""Allergic to Ancient Macedonian Dodo Birds"", one of the great classic episodes of the series and a tour de force for Agnes Moorehead when Endora loses her powers much to Darrin's delight, however the delight turns to horror when a ""mortal"" Endora proves even more impossible to cope with in the Stephens' household.""Humbug Not To Be Spoken Here"", a wonderful Christmas episode based loosely on Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", has Samantha showing the real meaning of Christmas and togetherness one magical Christmas Eve to a scrooge-like client of McMann and Tate. Elizabeth Montgomery has in my belief`never been lovelier than in this episode.""Once in a Vial"", another hilarious Agnes Moorehead performance when Endora by mistake drinks a love potion intended by her for Samantha and then runs off with one of Darrin's clients in a ""love potion induced romantic frenzy"", to get married!""Snob in the Grass"", Samantha has another encounter with Darrin's ex-fiance the bitchy Sheila Summers, (Nancy Kovak in a scene stealing performance), at a dinner party for a prospective McMann and Tate client. The evening comes to a climax in an all out cat fight between the two women with Sheila once again coming off the worse thanks to some of Samantha's well timed witchcraft.""If They Never Met"", a wonderfully romantic and at times sombre story where Endora takes Samantha back in time to see what Darrin's life would have been like had he and Samantha never met.""Samantha's Secret Saucer"", another of Aunt Clara's classic goof ups when she accidently (of course!) zaps a spaceship with two aliens onboard right down into the Stephen's backyard while spending the night babysitting Tabitha. This causes all kinds of trouble for Samantha and Darrin with both the military and an ever suspicious Mrs Kravitz before Aunt Clara remembers how to send them back into space. This sadly proved to be Marion Lorne's last appearance on ""Bewitched"", as the daffy but loveable Aunt Clara just prior to the actresses death in early 1968.",Bewitched: Season 4

Nothing could be farther from the truth.The show is quirky, but not so much that it seems they are trying too hard.  The ethical situations and dilemmas that frequently pop up are well handled, not trite, and have many sides to them. Real life is rarely so black and white that you know, without a doubt, what the right thing to do is.

360199,"""The Wicker Man"" is a stylistic look at paganism and hedonism.  In all fairness, this movie should not be even characterized as a horror movie as there is very little that is horrifying about this movie except for the ending, and the ending is rather predictable.  This movie may appeal to some viewers for its artistic and informative look at the trappings of a paganistic society, but if you are a true horror movie fan like myself, you are not interested in that.  I bought this movie because, ahem, it was supposed to be the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror movies, and that is just horse manure.  In fact, I found this movie to be painfully boring, and too reliant on the ending as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.  Then again, if you like naked girls dancing in the grass, this could be your thing, but as the English would so eloquently say, this is just not my cup of tea.As a side note, the police man's character is played by Edward Woodward who is the same actor who was the main character in that old show called ""The Equalizer"".  Hmmmm, maybe his character in ""The Wicker Man"" should have turned into The Equalizer Man at some point during the movie and mowed everyone down with his uzi; wouldn't have hurt this film any.In all fairness, everyone should see the original ""The Wicker Man"" at least once.

107661,"Kevin Costner always comes off best onscreen when he plays the bad boy who refuses to grow up, an archetype he played to acclaim in his star-making performance in Lawrence Kasdan's ""Silverado"" (1985), as well as his supporting turn in Mike Binder's ""The Upside of Anger"" in 2005. That's why his high-spirited charisma provides the chief pleasure in this forgotten 1985 coming-of-age road comedy. Granted, he is discernibly too old for the role of a rowdy University of Texas graduate who leads his four buddies, known together as the Groovers, on a no-holds-barred road trip across the expanses of West Texas before each goes their separate ways. However, the unwieldy combination of juvenile hi-jinks and dramatic undertones somehow manages to work, although I doubt if the testosterone-fueled antics will please everyone.Director/screenwriter Kevin Reynolds expanded a USC student film into an infectious study of beer-guzzling boys on the cusp of manhood in 1971 as the Vietnam War rages on half a world away. Costner is the smooth-talking slacker Gardner, while Judd Nelson is the uptight Phil more than ready to serve overseas and Sam Robards is the confused Kenneth who has regretfully decided to dump his fianc&eacute;e Debbie when he is about to be drafted. Of course, complicating matters is the fact that Gardner has not gotten over his previous relationship with Debbie. All three young actors are quite good within the predictable confines of their roles. The story really amounts to their various misadventures, often amusing, especially the chaotic parachuting sequence, but all underlined by the irrefutable fact that this is their last hurrah as carefree carousers. There's a good use of period music in the background, though the best are the instrumental tracks from Pat Matheny which underline the emotional finality of the climax. The 2005 DVD only contains the original theatrical trailer as an extra.",N/A

25818,"The Wages of Fear (Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1953)Widely considered Henri-Georges Clouzot's finest film, The Wages of Fear is the story of four poverty-stricken men hired by a rapacious oil company to transport two trucks full of nitroglycerin over three hundred miles of very bad road to an oil well fire. And for what it's worth, the film is very good at what it does; the problem, from the point of view of someone watching it over half a century after its original release, is that it would be very hard to see this film without having heard much of the hype about it beforehand. (One would have to avoid most reviews of the movie, as well as the copy on the DVD case. This is, of course, well nigh impossible.) While it is, in fact, a thriller, it takes more than a few minutes to get rolling (in fact, in the 148-minute restored edition, the guys aren't hired by the oil company for over an hour). Because of this, it seems there are actually two movies here-- one about life in poverty in a nameless South American town (and we've seen that one before, except it was called The Treasure of the Sierra Madre), and one about transporting nitroglycerin. The second is the better work by far, an interesting and engaging portrait of four friends and how the stress of the job tests their friendship as much as their nerves. I'm not terribly sure I'd call it a thriller as much as a simple drama; still, it's well worth your time if you're looking for a good, long movie to get yourself absorbed in. *** ",The Wages of Fear

105952,"Over half a century since its first release, ""The Searchers"" remains a landmark of American cinema, perhaps the greatest Western ever made, and the one against which all others must be measured.  John Ford, who more or less defined the conventions of this genre with films like ""Stagecoach,"" ""My Darling Clementine,"" and ""Fort Apache,"" never made a better, more complex Western than this one, and he may never have made a better film -- an extraordinary claim, when you consider that Ford gave us such classics as ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and ""How Green Was My Valley.""""The Searchers"" operates on so many levels at once, it takes nearly a dozen separate viewings to begin to appreciate them all.  Even then, you can always find something new in this film every time you view it.  It's extraordinary.This film demands to be viewed in the widescreen format, so just ignore the ""full-screen"" edition.  It's a waste of time.  Ford never shot his Monument Valley locations as lovingly, as achingly, or as heartbreakingly as he does here, and that's part of the point.  If you consider the landscape not as backdrop or scenery, but as a separate character in its own right, whole new levels of meaning and thematic development begin to reveal themselves.  The neighboring Jorgenson family then emerges not as minor characters whose function is to help the plot along, but as a sort of Greek chorus.  Their comments about ""This land..."" expressed not in sentences, but in sighs and shrugs become symbolic of the personal sacrifices necessary to the settling and ""civilizing"" of the Western wilderness.  Seen in that light, the female characters, who are less than fully developed, suddenly become the whole point of the movie.  Remember, the quest which generates the whole story is to restore the abducted Debbie to her ""rightful home,"" even though that home no longer exists.As Ethan Edwards, the main character, John Wayne gives the performance of his career.  Never before or since would Wayne portray a character as complex or conflicted as Ethan Edwards, and you can't imagine anyone else who could pull it off.  While Edwards exudes all of the ""manly virtues"" Wayne's characters are famous for: strength, toughness, the skills necessary to the task at hand, an uncompromising sense of honor, etc. with Ethan Edwards, there's a hole in that honor.  Edwards is also an uncompromising racist at heart, something which he makes clear early on and throughout the picture.  He is a character driven as much by his hatred of Indians as he is for the love of his departed family, and he must resolve this conflict by the end of the story, when his quest is finally completed.Through the internal conflicts of his characters, director Ford is able to say some very subtle things about ""the winning of the West"" and the price American civilization paid for it.  It's not all glorious.  Some of it is down-right ugly, but Ford is too subtle an artist to editorialize or let you know what he thinks about it.  Instead, through the vehicle of this single story, Ford is able to say: ""Look.  This is what happened, and this is why it happened this way,"" and let the viewer draw his own conclusions about the goodness or rightness of that.This is one extraordinary movie.  If you're serious about American cinema, Westerns, John Ford or John Wayne, it's essential.  It's essential even if you're not serious about any of that.  It's one of the best, if not the best Western ever made.",N/A

Wonder why they put Wahlberg's name so big above the title, and his photo goes on the poster, when director Antoine Fuqua systematically throws the whole movie to Michael Pena, who plays a rookie FBI agent, Nick Memphis, who cracks the whole case open and gets to be responsible for clearing Wahlberg's name.Maybe Wahlberg was busyt making another movie so his screen time wss limited for this one?  But every time you think, OK, now Bobby Lee is really in trouble, wonder how he's going to get out of this one, Fuqua switches the action to miles away, to wherever Nick Memphis just happens to be.  If I didn't know better I'd think that the movie was planned to be just the first in a whole line of ""Nick Memphis"" action thrillers, in which Michael Pena would become a superstar on the line of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Hispanic.  The script had a lot of implausibilities, but surely the name ""Nick Memphis"" itself is the worst offender?  OK, maybe he was from Memphis, but that's like me calling myself Kevin San Francisco.

Dance Marathons were a way for the ""masses"" to relieve themselves of the VERY real pressures that The Depression brought to everyday existence.The action on-screen is at times, so frenetic that I found myself exhausted at the end of the film! The process these people go through is laid bare for examination, and the change in social attitudes is evident in the cynicism shown by it's characters....most notably Jane Fonda's character.There is desperation, as well. This is the underlying sod that gives rise to the actions taken by some of the contestants. Since this takes place in California (presumably in the Venice/Santa Monica area), the presence of starry-eyed dreamers wishing to become Movie Stars is almost required.The Dance Contest is exposed for what it is, too late for some, but as I said, the desperation shown by the contestants forces them to do what they may have never even given thought to....if there were no depression.This film is a little ""snowglobe"" of what it was like to live in a time when literally, you had to live by your wits......or starve.""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" is largely forgotten these days.

970360,"This is an extraordinary movie.  It deals with realistic situations and realistic people without being oppressive.  When people stop associating with other people who are wrong for them and manage to fall in with the sort of people who are right for them, their lives improve dramatically, as happens in this movie.Other reviewers have picked up on how the judge helped this teenage girl, but they didn't see how the girl helped the grown woman also.  By being brazen enough, and smart enough to ask some searching questions, she helped.  Also, the parallel in situations between the girl and the grown woman with regard to their respective fathers made for a rich story.This movie should also be commended for having been brave enough to deal with a bright kid, and for understanding how bright kids are different and how even their emotional problems are different.Quibbles: the transition for the girl was a bit too fast.  It was not unrealistic, but it needed more development.  This of course would have slowed down the pace of the movie, however, and most viewers would have liked it less.  The movie is only 80 minutes long.  It would have been better at the usual TV-movie length of 100 minutes.Also, the father's reaction at the end was not credible to me.  Maybe he did feel guilty, but he was also feeling a lot of other things.  His avoidance reaction was just not credible.In defense of the movie, however, against another commenter: there are ends left open at the movie's end.  One cannot assume the exact nature of those resolutions and condemn the movie for making these resolutions which it in fact leaves open.  Also, it is not at all unrealistic that the judge found the father: after all, she was looking through the records to do just that.Bottom line: Don't miss this movie.

962484,"My interest in Louisiana Purchase dates back to my touring in New Orleans in 2003, which is the bicentennial. Then I know the St. Louis Arch and the Lewis and Clark Expedition are also related to this. It also leads me to eagerly know more about Thomas Jefferson. I am very glad that at least one, and the only one so far, DVD is available for the topic of the Louisiana Purchase.The strength of this DVD is the comprehensive explanation of the background. The America's west expansion and Spain's closing the port of New Orleans motivate the necessity to gain control of New Orleans. Haiti's overthrowing France and Napoleon's attempt to wage war against the Britain, thus needing money, play key factors to the success of acquiring New Orleans and even the whole Louisiana Territory. During the going, good luck also stands by Jefferson's side. Last, Britain's loan to the US government seals the whole deal, which is quite ironic.Overall, the international situation, including the aspects of US, France, Spain and Britain, at that time is well explained. I enjoy this very much and learn a lot deeper than before. The dispute and the impact of the Louisiana Purchase, however, are not addressed much in this film.

565320,"Well, so here's another attempt at ""Dune;"" a book that's probably consider to be one of the best Sci-fi ever written - even without its sequels. So, why is it that with such great material in hand, the adaptions have fallen so short?David Lynch, who in my opinion, is a great director and visionaire, did his version of ""Dune"" in the 1980's; unfortunately it wasn't one of his best work (although I have heard that the real culprit might have been Dino De Laurentiis; the producer of the film, aka director of Flash Gordon). Lynch's ""Dune"" was a bit on the weird side (not surprising), and the entire film was difficult to comprehend for viewers who are not already familar with the story and its characters. Thankfully, Sci-Fi channel's ""Dune"" somewhat fixed this problem.Sci-Fi channel's version of ""Dune"" added dialogues and scenes to make the story more coherent to any newcomer. So, I think most people should be able to follow the progression. In fact, if you never read the book, you might even think these minseries are pretty good. The special effects are on par with what you would expect from a made-for-tv movie. The actors do a decent enough job, so nothing seems too cheesy. And since this version follows the original book fairly close, if you're a sci-fi fan, it should definitely be interesting.However, one problem does arise from these sands of ""Dune."" The casting. The casting sucked. I'm sorry, but William Hurt does not even remotely resemble Leto Atreides. Alec Newman doesn't look like Paul, and Thuir Hawat seems wrong (where are the wrinkles), so does Duncan Idaho, Dr. Yueh, etc. Some people might says this is not a big deal, but you know what? I had to sit through 6 hours, watching a blonde Paul Atreides.

A long story short, they all agree to go, and four of them set out for the Pacific U.S. in an adventure that has no plans, and no cellphones.The format was pretty predictable: the four would do something, and something would go wrong. The trick was guessing what went wrong with each new event. The humour is fairly slapstick in nature, though there is a deeper side to it. I have to admit, the deeper side comes in pretty shallow, in all honesty.This is no deep movie, though the critique of mid-life surburban boredom could be a target of the movie's comment. However, the movie is one that will appeal to the most basic of humours, (that is, like myself), and will keep one entertained for the duration. I am not sure it is worth a second or third viewing, but it was sure funny during the first one.",N/A

The documentary traces Presley's life from his humble origins in Tupleo, Mississippi, thru his early recording days.  It delves into the controversy surrounding his early TV and radio appearances, explores his time in uniform and return to show business, offers a glimpse of his film career and observes over his death and the legacy he left behind.The documentary feature is worth owning the DVD for, but the special features truly make this a must have.  Over an hour of special features are present on the DVD, and some of the footage has never been released before.

The pace is perfect for beginners or intermediate practitioners, however there is an advanced pose called ""Fish"" that may present quite a challenge. What I liked most about this workout is the time given for each posture. When doing the Seated Forward Fold, they give enough time to relax fully into the pose. You may also recognize Camel, Boat, Triangle and Dophin pose. The mood is very relaxing with a desert setting and a backdrop of clouds. This workout leaves you feeling refreshed and relaxed as there is an extended session at the end where you can meditate and relax fully.~The Rebecca Review",N/A
629261,"A lot of love circulates around Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning performance here, and yes he did do a wonderful imitation of the real thing, but to me `Ray' has a lot more deserving areas to give consideration and appreciation.  For one, the set designs are brilliant, the lighting and mood of just about every scene is fantastic and the musical numbers, while all actual recordings, are choreographed in such a way that you could swear Foxx did all his own singing.  Case in point, there is a scene where Ray is singing in a club and in the recording some of the first words out of his mouth are mumbled and so to make it authentic Jamie knocks the microphone off balance for a moment.  It's the little touches like that one that make this movie authentic, accurate and worth while.I did enjoy Foxx, so don't get me wrong, but I did feel that his work in `Collateral' was more deserving of the praise.  The main problem I have with Foxx's performance is that he invests so much time and energy into getting Ray down that he forgets to infuse enough of himself into the performance to make Jamie the actor stand out aside from Ray the character.  But, with that little jab of criticism I will admit that he's a force on screen and demands you pay attention.That said, to me the real star of this film is the man behind the camera, Taylor Hackford.  His acute eye for detail is fantastic here, and is a huge step up from his previous work.  Technically `Ray' is far from my favorite biopic, even in the year of the biopic it falls short of perfection and or utter brilliance, but when `Ray' hits its mark it hits it with such beautiful depth and clarity that it makes up for its minor shortcomings.  Did it deserve a `Best Picture' Oscar nomination?  Not really, but I'm not going to whine about that too much.Another aspect of the film that shines like a diamond among pearls is the impressive female supporting cast, all of which deserved any and all recognition and praise for they all were essential in not only developing the man that was Ray into a full blown character study but they were also pertinent in making `Ray' the film a film entertaining and relatable from beginning to end.  Kerry Washington, an actress I've just fallen in love with over the years, gives such a brutally honest performance as Charles wife, the woman who stands by her man and supports him despite his addictions to drugs and loose women.  Regina King gives probably the most explosive performance of the bunch as Margie, one of Ray's backup singers and his obsessive secret lover.  Her brilliance on screen is matched only by her spunk and heart and it's a true pleasure to watch her chew each and every scene she encounters.  Sharon Warren also does a splendid job as Ray's mother and is sure to stand out as a remembered favorite.The life of Ray Charles was a hard one, full of deceit, drugs, women and pressure.  He was abused, taken advantage of and used and on the other side he abused, took advantage of and used others in the process, but the true story of Ray Charles is a story about overcoming our weaknesses and growing into the person we knew we had in us all along, the person who has been dying to come out but just needed to opportunity.  My one big disappointment with this film is that it never truly shows us the recovery Ray made.  We see his struggles, his problems and his faults.  We see him finally realize he needs help but we never see him truly change, we just read about it in a montage of newspaper clippings that litter the final frames of the film.  It's a small quaral I know, but it's one I'm not ready to let go of.  If the ending had only added as much depth as the beginning and middle had then maybe this would have been a more deserving film to me, but in the end, even with my issue included, `Ray' is still a wonderful biopic, one that I'm happy to have seen and will most definitely see again.",Ray

436348,"This is by far the best image quality yet that I have seen of this wonderful film. However, considering that this is the exact same print that has been in circulation for many years, and the print is full of scratches, artifacts, and shakes, jumps and jitters along the way, the beginning statement is not a endorsement. Now, to be fair there is some slight improvement in quality. There is much more sharpness and detail than the previous version. It doesnt look as washed out as the other version did. It has also been speed corrected  to have a more natural and smoother flow to it. Also a new stereo surround music accompaniment has been added. It is a much more enjoyable experience to view than before. Lon Chaney gives a superb performance as the hunchback Quasimodo. His makeup is nothing short of astounding. With this set you also get a short collection of 3D stills that may be viewed (3D glasses are included), a collection of flat 2D stills and publicity items, a few minutes of silent footage of Chaney on the set of the picture (out of costume and makeup), and also a few minutes of a very early film appearance of Chaney called Alas And Alak made in 1913. He also appeared as a hunchback in this film. This is for the present time the best version available. Unless a better print is discovered in the vaults somewhere this is it! Recommended.",N/A

But not always apparently.... as I went out last week and spent a cool twenty bucks on this waste of time.I didn't read any reviews as I usually would. I heard so much raving on this one, that I figured it must be somewhat good.First off, the movie doesn't focus very much on getting any sort of laughs... in fact for the most part the story just gets more and more deppressing at it goes on...The big happy ending isn't even that great, and I can tell you straight up, I hated the way that penguin danced. The taps didn't even match his f*in feet!The penguins all were creepy looking.The story was weak.The music was terrible.

45884,"I came across this production at the library the other day.I began worrying a few minutes into the tape, when the narrator talked about ""a massacre that to this day remains one of our nation's greatest tragedies"". The fact that neither year nor location of this massacre were mentioned - I can only assume he was referring to Wounded Knee - bode ill for the portrayal of Native Americans in this film.Next, I was treated to an unctuous description of how the area we call Colorado today was formed. A few random animals were shown: eagle, beaver, rattlesnake, bison, and horses. No comment was made that there were no horses on the American continent until the Spaniards ""imported"" them.Twenty minutes into the first tape I had to stop watching because I found the way Native Americans are portrayed unbearable: The Arapaho wondering if a white man might be a god? In 1785? After Whites had been in the country for nearly 200 years? (Not to mention that, to the best of my knowledge, Plains Indians' religions did not include the concept of gods.) And a whole warrior party of Pawnee unable to overpower a single white trader, even fleeing from him - because he fires a gun?

1036716,"I'm as impressed as everyone who's reviewed this video before me. Being unable to resist belly dance videos (and having only those for instruction) I've ended up collecting a shocking number of them. Of these, at least 90 percent must be belly dance isolations. So you wouldn't think I needed any more. Well think again.I immediately loved Ariellah's two fantastic drills -adding up to 75 minutes of hard work. I haven't managed 75 at a go yet but am notching up to about 40 minutes so far. That's separate from all the yoga. Ariellah has selected yoga poses and very thoughtfully, there's a short session for those who are not yoga-familiar and a longer one for those who are.There are no distractions during these drills. Nothing comes in the way. Not the music, not too much talking - nothing. It's an intuitively put together set of drills in which she gives tips I haven't found anywhere else in all my videos and reminders on posture and breathing. Her timing with these is impeccable. Just when I find I'm getting tired, she says ""Go on for a bit longer"" . That comes from being very well tuned into what her dance students must feel.Ariellah is all about control right down to the micromovement. If you've seen her elsewhere, you'll know that the seems to take the music, reroute it right through her body, and by the time it reaches you, you're seeing the music as well as hearing it. Her drills begin to give you the foundation for that control In just a few sessions I've found a visible difference with the sharpness of my hip and rib cage movements. The arms? A long way to go for me but I'm relentlessly sticking to the especially solid arms section. All I can say is that I can finely shimmy one shoulder at a time now. Well, the right one, anyway.The combinations are versatile and for me, make a fantastic collection when combined with similar ones from other tribal fusion videos like East Coast Tribal and Tribal Fusion NYC. Also Bellydance for Beautiful Freaks.I also like a lot of the music on this video, though the lyrics of one or two are nothing to dance about. Something about a plane about to come down. I'm not so sure about that. But the most-used song, Stiga, by the group Lumin, is very sensual and addictive.","Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, with Ariellah: Tribal fusion bellydance classes, Belly dance fitness, workout, and yoga instruction, Beginner-intermediate"
1045101,"This PPV was the first PPV under the Vince Russo era & it surpassed the Bound For Glory event on so many levels.  Storylines progressed, there were plenty of suprizes, and a main event worthy of the hype it recieved.Preshow: Eric Young vs. Robert Roode - This was just a short match between the two in which Roode cheated in the end to win but the referee restarted the match after the fans told him he cheated  in which Young pulled off a quick win & the crowd denied that Young cheated...when he did.  This began the Ms. Brooks/Eric Young storyline which would go on for the next couple of months.Voodoo Kin Mafia vs. Serotonin - This was just an opener for VKM to mock DX & being their ""mission"" against DX & Vince McMahon.  Afterwards, it was revealed that Raven was the leader of the Serotonin group.Jay Lethal & Sonjay Dutt vs. The Naturals - The Naturals were in full heel mode here and delievered a solid matchup with Lethal & Dutt.  Good match overall.X Division Champion Christopher Danials vs. Chris Sabin - Sabin was always one of the most underrated X division stars but now he's got a cocky personality to make him standout above others.  This was one of the best matches of the night with solid inring work & not the ""car crash"" high spots that have sterotyped the X divison. The finish also helped further the Lynn/Sabin storyline as well & play a role later in the night as well with AJ Styles saving Daniels in this match.Lance Hoyt & Ron Killings vs. Austin Starr & Alex Shelly - This was just a filler match to further the storyline of Shelley being jealous of Kevin Nash's favoritism towards Austin Starr which was apparent in the end when Shelley ended up losing the match trying to showoff for Nash.  It's just said that Ron Killings & Lance Hoyt (who's very athletic for his size) were nothing more than a filler tag team to further a storyline between two other wrestlers.AJ Styles vs. Christian Cage - It's disappointing that these two wouldn't go on for a longer fued after this because this match went really well.  Second best match of the night as their different styles meshed well together.  The ending of this match came when Daniels tried to save AJ like he did earlier in the night but it backfired which helped set up the AJ Styles/Rhino fued for the next upcoming months.NWA World Tag Team Champions  LAX vs. America's Most Wanted - Solid tag team match between the two teams but it was a little short to turn into something memorable & the bigger picture at the end of the match was Jim Cornette saying that LAX were stripped of the tag team titles to which the fans were very vocal about...in a negative way.NWA World Heavyweight Champion Sting vs. Abyss - I was expecting to see Sting to do his usual stops throughout this match but Sting stepped it up in this match the way he should have at Bound For Glory.  There was a mix of brawling & in the ring action before it went hardcore with Sting even landing shirtless on tacks harder & stiffer than than Ric Flair got it in ECW months earlier.  However, when Sting absolutely loses his mind is when the match goes downhill.  He beats Abyss down, hangs him & beats him with his bat before putting him through barbed-wire boards...all of which took a while to set up each spot.  Sting ended up getting disqualified & Abyss wins the NWA Title due to a rule that has been around since TNA started up but people forgot about it because alot of the TNA title matches in recent years don't end with the champions getting disqualified or counted out.  It's something that ""traditional"" wrestling fans don't like & don't agree with.Kurt Angle vs Samoa Joe - The match was a disappointment in most people's eyes because they were expecting the type of dream match Angle had with Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 21 in which they put on a 30 min. rollercoaster of a wrestling clinic.  However, this heavily resembles Angle's WrestleMania 22 match in which it didn't go long (less than 15 mins.) but in that entire time, they went high impact & there wasn't a slow moment which left you wanting more as Joe's undefeated streak came to an end.  The crowd was heavily into it & the aftermath guarenteed that you would get a rematch.In the end, this PPV delievered quality matches & had a main event that that wasn't a wrestling clinic but an enjoyable intense rollercoaster of a match.

119262,"""They Drive by Night"" dawns as a hard core trucker yarn. Bogey and George Raft are brothers trying to hack it in a tough racket and dreaming of making it big.  TDN soars when on the ground. Viewers get a gritty close up view of the rigors faced by independent drivers scrambling for loads and avoiding rip offs and unsavory characters.  Then Bogey loses his arm in an accident, leaving GR to support his brother and wife.  GR lands a straight job and this reviewer believes the film loses focus. Blue collars are exchanged for white shirts and dinner parties. A definite ""complication"" arises when Ida Lupino, the wife of Raft's boss, makes a play for him. A clumsy murder plot develops, straining credibility. This reviewer believes that by the time TDN reaches its' resolution, the film has lost its' way. The final call here is that the ""over the road"",  early part of the movie easily rates 5 stars, but the latter, more ""sophisticated"" second half rates only 3. That averages out to 4 stars- which is not bad if one concedes that TDN is essentially 2 movies in one. Viewer interest may be elevated by the knowledge that the 1940 TDN was one of Bogey's last films before the release of ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""High Sierra"" and ""Casablanca"" and his climb to major stardom.",N/A

199554,"An irrelevant, dopey, unbelievable subplot involving dad/son/Japanese girlfriend and other personal stuff, along with overacting by Heston and an inexplicably silly performance by Hal Holbrook, is very nearly cause for avoiding this half-baked war movie. I received this edition from Amazon as a gift from a relative.  One previous reviewer noted that if the original movie's 30-minute intro section on the Tokyo Raid and Coral Sea had been retained for the DVD, this would have been a ""much better"" release.  No way.  Besides material stolen from Thiry Seconds Over Tokyo, Tora Tora Tora, and even John Ford's 1942 Pearl Harbor documentary (!), you have a shot of a swastika-clad German Bf109 being shot down by the Japanese (Messerschmitts at Midway?  Mmm, no, I don't buy it); on a carrier deck, a pilot climbs into a 1942 SBD Dauntless and takes off in a 1945 Hellcat; in a sequence of quick shots of AA batteries aboard a Japanese carrier shooting at American planes, you briefly see a shot from an American carrier firing at kamikazes off Okinawa in 1945; a shot of a Jap carrier is labeled ""The Kaga"", but is another unnamed Japanese carrier, looks like the Soryu; there are plenty of shots of larger American Essex class carriers beyond CV-9, none of which had been built in June 1942; and there's lots of color carrier action news footage that's easily recognizable as film shot during the Marianas campaign in 1944.  It's a shame, because by 1976 there existed more than enough authentic footage from early WWII to make three versions of this film. This movie does, probably by accident, have several seconds of slightly colorized b&w footage that was actually shot during the real battle of Midway.  In case no one noticed, almost every American naval officer in this movie, and some of the Army personnel, are out of uniform. The 2 stars of charity I give here are for the last half of the film, which sticks at least fairly accurately to real events, though it short-changes some important ones and ends before the real battle did. The producers might at least have used WWII footage of PBY Catalina patrol planes, but the PBY's shown here have post-Korea paint jobs. Near the end, the film does accurately depict some of the serious horror and blood of carrier warfare. But overall, ""Midway"" doesn't come close to giving us the full import of this battle, which historians class as one of the most influential battles in naval history - - a list that includes Marc Antony's defeat at Actium, the sinking of the Spanish Armada, the Battle of Trafalgar, and even the Battle of the Coral Sea (which preceded Midway by less than a month, but which is cut from this DVD release).  On the other hand, Amazon's price is almost reasonable if you count the battle sequence and added features. But don't expect too much from the  battle scenes -- expect even less from the movie's first hour.  Low budget or no low budget, this is not a fitting tribute to the meager but brave force that stood up to a huge enemy navy  in the early, desperate days of the Pacific war.",N/A

1060513,"I guess that was my question when I first read the press release on this entertaining little film about life in the World War II Japanese ""relocation camps"" in Utah. Well, I can't really say they do but the film is still worth recommending, if only because it does a good job of telling the little covered story of life in these ""camps"", which herded everybody of Japanese decent (even a Blck Hawaiian!) into what were virtually upscale concentration camps. These people, many of who were born as American citizens were treated like foreigners because of the color of their skin and their heritage.But back to the film. It revolves around one young man who was destined for college on a scholarship on ""the day that will live in infamy"" - December 7, 1941. We learn that he loved jazz and he shares is love by playing records for his friends and playing saxophone for himself. He also loves baseball, as - until the war - there were many Japanese baseball players.In the camp he meets a local (non-Japanese) girl (the daughter of one of the town's bigots - an all too contrived plot device) and she plays piano. They meet through playing together. But just about then jazz - and music in general disappears completely from the screenplay! Now it's about baseball and the ""big game"" between the Japanese players and the bigoted ""townies"". I won't give more of the plot away except to say that I was disappointed to see the jazz thread not continue.Because there are so few films about this period in time -  ""Come See The Paradise"" is the only other one I know of - this is an important film to see. The ""Making of"" bonus feature (about 25 minutes long) repeats lots of the scenes but also - a bit too briefly - interviews survivors of these camps.).Definitely worth at least a rental.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",American Pastime
790654,"Almen Wong plays a woman who runs a camp that kidnaps 12 and 13 year old girls and trains them to be assassins.  They start out with about 30 girls and only one of them will survive.  After the girls are trained for 6 years they are forced to kill eachother in different competitions.  In the second of these competitions it is decided to let 3 of the girls live instead of 1.  2 of the the girls (Maggie Q and Anya) are very close to eachother and the other one (Jewel Lee) is a cold blooded killing machine.  When the girls take up their positions as assassins, the movie all of a sudden becomes extremely boring and mindless.  The cop that is following the assassins is one of the most incompetent lead actors I have ever seen.  Nothing he does is believable and while he looks to be about 23 years old, he acts 14.  Then you would think it would be exciting when the girls go on their missions, but there is no thought put into it.  Some bad guy is inserted at the end of the movie and him and one of the girl assassins fight to the death.  It is completely ridiculous!  The movie is produced by Wong Jing so I did expect it to be stupid, but the budget and style are much higher caliber than most Wong Jing movies.  And it lives up to its title by having plenty of good looking women in tank tops and short shorts and some brief nudity.  Anya and Maggie Q alone make this worth watching.The fights are what you would expect from Ching Siu Tung.  There is tons of wirework involved and the editing is very unique.  It's too flashy for my tastes, but still fun to watch.  The final fight is like a comic book and if you enjoy other Ching Siu Tung movies, then you are gonna love this.  I hated the final fight inThe Blacksheep Affair(another Ching Siu Tung movie), but the final fight in this is a little more fluent.  If you started watching kung fu movies because ofThe Matrix, then you are probably going to like the action in Naken Weapon.  If you are more of a fan of the old school movies and don't like wirework, then this is not for you.  Like I said it is too flashy for me, but I do appreciate the hard work and creativity put into it.If you are looking for a really good new age girls with guns movie then I highly recommend Corey Yuen'sSo Close.2.5/5This movie was shot in English and the voice acting is a little above average.

1129924,"Retro television shows have never done particularly well unless they were set in the Old West. Shows set in the 20's, 30's, 40's, etc, any era outside of the one in which they aired have never lasted long except in three major exceptions - Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and The Untouchables.The Untouchables succeeded for a number of reasons. First, the veil that had been on the Mafia for a number of years was slowly but surely being peeled off due to gangland killings and the fame of gangsters such as Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, and others. Even before the Godfather and its outstanding first sequel, the public had a fascination and curiosity with the mob. So take some true events, ture characters, heavily fictionalize them with Hollywood gloss and pathos, and you get a very successful show that made a star out of Robert Stack and brought new fame to a Treasury agent named Eliot Ness.The Untouchables' First Season collection should not have been split up into multiple sections. That's greed, pure and simple. But the lure of this show - its great characters, performances, grit and intelligence will draw buyers even though they know they're being ripped off. Stack's Ness is one of the best alltime detectives - fearless, relentless, and absolutely ruthless with the bad guys. The supporting casts were always excellent, and Bruce Gordon brough the right amount of humor and menace to Frank Nitti, Capone's chief lieutenant.The Untouchables - Season Two, Volume 1 is not untouchable, but it is irresistable.",N/A

They managed to turn what could have been a shadow of the first movie into a run little chase movie in its own right.  It was also interesting that they divided the movie into a 28 days/28 weeks later timeline (however briefly) to make the audience understand that the infection was happening in other parts of the country.All of those involved managed to do this by violating zombie movie rule #1 if a family member becomes contaminated destroy and dismember them immediately.

Samuel Jackson is great in a dramatic role as an ATF officer trying to track down the gunrunners that killed his partner and are selling the large shipment of guns they stole. Eugene Levy is pretty comical as the wrong man in the right place at the wrong time. He adds the comedic element to the movie as a dentist going to a convention in Detroit. When he gets mistaken for a gun buyer he ends up assisting Jackson, if you could call it that, in dealing with the gunnrunners. Nice mix of drama and humor and a decent story make it worth renting or even buying if you like comedy/drama cop movies.",The Man

579454,"I got this DVD because of the great reviewers comments on the cover.  My problem was that I could not understand what many of the actors were saying.  There were no English subtitles available so I tried French, which I do read a little.  This kept me so busy, translating, though, that I gave up after about 40 minutes.I think that if it had looked more interesting I might have kept at it, but it didn't.  The director was going for ""bleak"" it seems and he got it.  Sarah Polley who seemed to be a lead actor in the beginning was so pale and her voice was so blah that I had a hard time watching her.  The young male lead was equally uninteresting.  The older man (Peter Mullan?) and Mila Jovavich were much livelier, but it still wasn't enough for me.  The scenery was beautiful, but as another reviewer wrote, you could get that in The National Geographic. When a particularly spectacular snowy scene was shown, the music amped up as if to tell you that this was really a spectacular scene!  The scenes in the bar and brothel were repetitions of many other Old West films.  All of this was done sooo much better in McCabe and Mrs. Miler!The plot sounds interesting which makes sense since it's based on a novel by Thomas Hardy.

1098598,"There's nothing I love more than a zombie (zombi) film. Whether it is the needed social-commentary of a work like Halperin'sWhite Zombie(1932), the thought-provoking existentialism of Soavi'sCemetery Man(1994), or the playful relateability of Pegg/Wright'sShaun of the Dead(2004), I enjoy it all. In fact, I (like Danny Boyle, mind you) insist that28 Days Later)(2002) IS a zombie film, JUST so I can show it in my horror-film classes! Equally as revealing, I (INDEED!) went to every ""Resident Evil"" film on OPENING-NIGHT just to show my support for the undead. Bottomline: I'm not a zombie-snob. So, take my words to heart ... this film is shockingly sub-par.This work had everything in its favor! Foremost, it has top-notch actors like Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix,Memento, andChocolat), Dylan Baker (Requiem for a Dream,Spider-Man 2, andKinsey), and Billy Connolly (""Boondock Saints,"" ""White Oleander,"" and countless television shows). Most horror-film directors are not that luckily. And, understand, these actors ""brought their 'A' game."" Their devotion to their roles is painfully clear ... and that only contributes to the uncomfortablenesses of the work (one begins to feel embarrassed for these committed actors). Secondly, Currie had a sizable budget: eight-million! (and has thus far only grossed about $300,000 since June). Pegg and Wright had EXACTLY half that budget for their zed-word ""comedy"" and quadrupled it as of November 2004. In essence, Currie had the gift of gorgeous sets, fantastic film-stock, luxurious props (like the cars!) ... amenities only this type of budget could permit. And for all its ""beauty"" ... for all its effort ... it fails ... epically.Undoubtedly, its fatal-flaw resides in its soundtrack. The ""light-instrumentals"" (practically lifted from 1950's sitcoms) undermines the film at every turn. It is not ironic ... it is not ""kitchy"" ... it is not creating an ""atmosphere"" ... it nearly, single-handedly destroys the film. Its literalness is exhausting. Moreover, watching the film is like trudging through molasses: it is excruciatingly slow and unrewarding (or, at least, I imagine this is what ""trudging through molasses"" might be like). Envision a rewrite of ""Lassie"" ... now replace Lassie with a ""pet-zombie."" The end. The first nod toward Beaudine Jr.'s work was amusing ... but the joke wears thin FAST! ""Is it Timmy? Is he in trouble? Show me boy!"" Et al. Uggggg.One point of frustration is Tim Blake Nelson's character of Mr. Theopolis. His contribution was the ONLY redeemable aspect of this entire film. It is a genuine shame that the director failed to focus on Nelson's demented-yet-likable character. To relegate such a respected actor (one beloved by the Coen Brothers) to a ""bit-part"" is a pity. The real film was with him and his zombie girlfriend (think of what could have been!) ... how did no one realize that?!Many viewers will be dazzled by the ""pretty colors,"" the wonderful sets, and the familiar actors ... most will find it completely transparent. Many will think they are ""supposed to like it"" ... most will realize it is reasonable NOT to like it. There is nothing innovative here ... nothing that hasn't been addressed elsewhere. I assure you, this is not the next zombie-classic ... in fact, I will be shocked if the film is in-print a year from now.Peter Travers of ""Rolling Stone"" magazine says it best: ""Director Andrew Currie is better at laughs than scares, but he can't sustain either as Fido runs out of steam in the final stretch."" And the other critics (who are remarkably amenable to horror in general) agree (like Richard Roeper).Need a final word? Here it is: this film commits the two cardinal sins of the horror/comedy genre: it is not scary (ever) and it just isn't funny.",Fido

1030384,"All I have to say is that this movie has a charming story about the true martial artist, Huo Yuanjia, who stood up against all those against China in dire times of diplomatic and social depravity of his people and rose above all odds and in the end, became a legend in his own right. What's sad is that the reality about Huo was so enthralled and mixed with legend that the so called 'truth' about him is a mystery. Was he able to jump over 20 feet in the air? Maybe. Was he truly the most legendary martial artist of all time? He could be. The fact that fiction revolves around his existence, or the short time there was of his (he died when he was in his 40's...) it's hard to tell who he really was... or how he really even died!Check him out, do some research about him and if you've seen the movie already, watch it again after gaining some insight and knowledge about this legendary man and you might gain an astounding amount of respect for this man and his exploits whether this film does the trick or not... the MESSAGE of the film overrules all else, just as Jet Li intends in this film. He wanted the lesson to be learned, of restraint, of martial arts being purely a defensive mechanics for self-improvement, discipline and insight.The story tends to jump around, a bit TOO much from one time frame into Huo's adulthood... but the final fight in the end, which is interluded in the beginning, then finished at the end of the movie... is soul moving. I've watched a lot of movies that have brought tears to my eyes, brought joy to my soul and laughter to my heart but the final fight in this movie was one of the most powerful scenes I'd ever seen in filmographic measure-- almost bringing up to the caliber of oldskool cinematography, like Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Not comparing, just stating and analysis of the scene-- it's simply something worth noting for on an immensely powerful level.This movie is a MUST if you love Jet Li.A MUST if you love martial arts.A MUST if you love wonderful cinematography.The movie is flat out great, some flaws in concept but the execution of its focus on wisdom outperforms everything else.",N/A

1074842,"Seeing the preview for this movie, I knew two things: 1) Terrence Howard would likely give a great performance, 2) it would have a great soundtrack.I was right on both counts.  Terrence Howard is one of my favorite actors these days (seeHustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition), even if rap music isn't your thing).  His work here as an amateur swim coach is solid.  And the music featured throughout the movie is classic '70s soul and r&b;, so if you like that stuff - crank up the volume.What I didn't know for sure after seeing the preview - but strongly suspected - was that the movie would be formulaic and predictable.  This suspicion was confirmed after viewing the movie.  But what surprised me was just how poorly the forumla is executed.  I love this kind of movie when it's well done.  Even when I know pretty much what will happen, I can easily get caught up in the insprirational rush.  This one doesn't work, for a number of reasons.  The kids who decide to form a swim team - they aren't even allowed one personality trait each.  Sure, there is the poor student who's guardian doesn't want him to be even more distracted from his schoolwork by extracirricular activities.  But for the most part, the ensemble of young actors - and one actress - who make up the underdog swim team aren't given anything specific to do.  Well, they like swimming, but that's about it.  In fact, when the all-boys team gets a first female member, nothing even slightly interesting is done with that plot development.Bernie Mac plays the manager of the youth center - scheduled to be closed down - at which Terrence Howard and his charges train for swim meets.  Howard is a government worker who is told to close up the rec center.  Mac's character is very disgruntled by the prospect of losing the center (which is so unfrequented that he can sit around watching soap operas all day).  Later, he becomes friends with Howard and helps the swim team in what are quite frankly unspecified ways.  I liked Mac's performance quite a bit - he's funny at times, but it's mostly a dramatic performance.  But the reasons he warms up to Howard and his attempts to organize a competitive swim team are unclear.Anyway, the movie chugs along and hits all the expected plot points as Howard helps the kids learn to take pride in themselves.  The all-black team is met with harsh and disturbing racism (including racist white audience members at a swim meet who laugh derisively when one of the black swimmers injures himself).  These elements are all handled fairly perfunctorily - the strength being found primarily in the excellent acting.When it comes right down to it - swimming just doesn't translate particularly well to cinema.  Unlike many other sports, there are great limitations in maintaining visual interest in multiple people swimming in a pool.",N/A

1006193,"This is pretty much a homage to1997 Escape from New York.  The plot, such as it is, is quite similar and the title's similarity to ""Assault on Precinct 13"" shows that it is intentional (also, 1997 + 13 = 2010, the year this is supposed to take place in).The sport of ""parkour"", or obstacle running in urban terrain, is something I first saw on a flight back from Europe (""Jump London"", I think).  Wonders of wonders, I watched an in-flight video!  Very acrobatic, very neat and impressive.  But then I like watching skateboarder tricks as well and I climb in gyms.  In this case, parkour really meshes in very well with the fight scenes.  David Belle, who plays the main protagonist, is apparently its inventor so it is very well choreographed here.There is a sly bit of social commentary on the policies of the government regarding the banlieues.  One-sided, for sure (the inhabitants are by no means blameless), but well-deserved nevertheless.And, guess what, there is a neat twist at the end as well (just like Snake's).  Overall, this is a good action film.  But it is _brilliant_ if you would like an Euro spin on over-the-top action movies likeOng-Bak, early Jackie Changs, Bruce Lees, etc.BTW, the ""B13"" zone is unfortunately not all that fictional. ""Seine Saint-Denis"" is the roughest of the 5 or 6 'departements' (province/state) surrounding Paris and making up its banlieue (suburbs).  France numbers departements and this one is #93.  In French, 93 is ""quatre-vingt treize"".  Literally, ""80 13"" or 'four score and thirteen'.  People will say things like ""he grew up in the '93', that explains it"".  No, they don't have walls around it, and most of it is working-class, not a ghetto. But there are quite a few spots where the police does not customarily go after dark.

They are victims of the intolerance, misunderstanding, and mistrust that seem to be ever-present in human society...

Their hated Puerto Rican rivals, the Sharks appear, charged with aggressive energy... Both gangs compete for the control of the poor and filth neighborhood...Jerome Robbins's powerful choreography captures the explosive tension boiling in the big city slums...

Their love blossoms out on a poignant scene in ""Tonight,"" and at a bridal shop (""One hand, One Heart"") when both affirm their love for each other by celebrating a mock marriage ceremony...'West Side Story' is a beautiful work of art with spectacular music and energetic dancing... It is surely the finest dance musical since 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.' The principal dance numbers are all terrific... The propulsive movement of Riff and the Jets as contrasted with the free movement of Bernardo and the Sharks...Rita Moreno is spitfire as Anita... Her skillful dancing and Latin temperament are perfect for the character of Anita, a fiery lady who leads her girls in an exciting mambo dance... ""Life is alright in America"" is possibly the most triumphant sequence of the film... A welcome tone of mockery is introduced, and the 'mambo' atmosphere makes you want to jump out of your seat and dance...'West Side Story' is a calculated milestone in screen musicals... It breaks new ground in its depiction of contemporary social issues in a musical... The motion picture explores with deep emotional resonance, a world of hate, violence and prejudice... It challenges all of us to struggle for understanding and justice...History will remember Leonard Bernstein as the most important American musical force in the 20th Century... He is one of the greatest conductors that has ever lived... In 'West Side Story' his superb music communicates directly with the heart...",N/A

We do not censor the violence, nudity, language and sex of these programs.  I could be wrong, and this episode may indeed be too graphic or disturbing to see the light of day, but our kids watch far worse in their cartoon selections on a daily basis and in their video game choices.  This show was not meant for kids.  It is adult programming, and we should be given the opportunity to decide for ourselves what shows we should watch.  All this set needed was a disclaimer or warning about this episode.  It makes me wonder how many other episodes of Hawaii Five-0 will be cut, and what are the reasons for these.

The battle scenes take on artistic beauty and you look for the details around the edges of the frame.  The gore of battle is a strange thing here.  The beheading is not horrible, but for some strange and weird reason you watch it noting the slow spraying of the blood and collapse of the head. And it is not upsetting nor grizzly but a work of art.  The dance by the woman is beautiful and it takes you time to notice that she is nude. Is it sexy or porn? No it is flowing and artful.There is one strange thing that happens after you have seen the movie. I am high school teacher and I found my male students not talking about about the battles nor the women, but spouting the dialoge from the movie.  They heard the words and the message, ""We are Sparta!"" rang down the halls of my school.",N/A

200755,"I may not have expected the midas touch of the original in ""Jaws 2,"" but I did expect some quality. I didn't think the ""Jaws"" brand name would be sold out so cheaply. But it was when it allowed itself to be applied to this stinker. Not only is the writing lousy, the characters are shallow at best, including municipal leaders who conveniently have very short memories as they relive the past and fall perfectly in line with the unimaginative story line. The Brody's themselves seem to have short memories, but they merely symbolize the rest of the town who, despite some awfully familiar clues, jump in and out of the water with wreckless abandon w/o giving the possibility of a shark even a remote consideration. And the shark itself takes on something of a slasher personna in its predatory behavior in the way it chooses its prey. Not to mention how unlike in the original, this shark plays to the camera and takes on un-shark like characteristics, expanding a little more on the original sharks acrobatics. All this sequel needs (as well as the 3rd and 4th installments) is a hockey mask for the shark and the creativity for the plot line would be complete. This may be the best of the ""Jaws"" sequels, but that's like saying the Gremlin was GMC's best car.",N/A
1014693,"OVERVIEW:What is contained in this Thinpak set is the entire series of Boogiepop Phantom (BP) - 12 episodes on 4 DVDs - and the live-action film ""Boogiepop and Others / Boogiepop Doesn't Smile"" (BaO). In Japan, Boogiepop was spawned as a series of young adult novels. BaO was the first novel released in the Boogiepop series, and the film is an adaptation of it. Therefor it is a prequel to BP. I originally watched the series first, but the 2nd time I watched the film then series. Watching BaO first is likely preferable, as it details the events that the BP is centered around. To watch BP with no knowledge of BaO can be even more confusing than it already is.BOOGIEPOP AND OTHERS / BOOGIEPOP DOESN'T SMILE7 / 10The film, like the series, tells multiple stories that intertwine concerning a central theme. Specifically, there's 4 stories that revolve around the appearance of a monster known as the manticore, a strange man known as Echoes, and Boogiepop herself. Boogiepop is a Shinigami, or the Japanese equivalent of Death. Boogiepop manifests as an alternate personality to an individual when dangers appear that threaten our world.This film is relatively low budget. You could call it the equivalent of a B-Movie. The special effects and action scenes are more laughable than anything, and the sound and music has a very un-professional feel. That said, it's surprisingly enjoyable. The cheesiness is kept to a minimum as the focus remains on the characters. Don't go into this expecting Hitchcock-like film mastery and it shouldn't be too hard to enjoy. The young cast is the highlight. I especially liked Boogiepop herself and Nagi Kirima. The vision it paints of Japan is actually a nice one, especially the shots of Boogiepop on top of the buildings at sunset. I also find the pacing here well done. Each story has its own flow, but at the same time It feels like a steady progression towards the conclusion. Many animes could actually learn a lesson about pace, rhythm, and timing from this flash-less film.The extras are nice and really extensive. They are perhaps better than the film itself (which can be taken as a good or bad thing). I especially enjoyed the ""making of"" featurette, as it appears the entire cast had a blast making the film. They include:*History of Boogiepop*Director's Commentary*Storyboards*Boogiepop in Yubari*Premier Featurette*Making of Boogiepop Featurette*Cast and Staff Bios*TrailersOverall, this is a quality adaptation of the novel if one doesn't judge it on too harsh of standards. I'm happy it's included as it's really helpful in understanding the Boogiepop universe before venturing into the difficult BP.BOOGIEPOP PHANTOM8 / 10This series centers around the events at the end of B&O;, and its lingering effects. The ""pillar of light"" that was seen in that night's sky gives multiple people strange abilities. With it came a rainbow-like haze that lingers over the city. An evil creature is lurking among the population and teenagers are disappearing. Boogiepop appears out of the form of Toka Miyashita to hunt down the unleashed evil along with Nagi Kirima. Even more mysterious is the appearance of Phantoms - echoes of beings that already exist. One such is a Phantom of Boogiepop. Rumors swirl of an organization behind the creation of beings known as composite humans. Memories of haunted pasts plague the people of the city, including a serial killer that stalked the city 5 years ago. What does all of this mean for the students of two local schools including Shinyo Academy?This is as bizarre an anime as there is. It has a Lain-like feel with its dark, mysterious tone. While Lain is more abstract and psychedelic, BP more direct and tangible - but don't confuse this with simplicity. BP's narrative is one of the most complex you'll see in anime. Like the film, it tells multiple stories in a fractured narrative - that never relies on linearity - that revolves around a central idea. These stories intertwine with others so you'll see glimpses of one within another from different points of views. Due to the wealth of stories, the cast is extremely large. It can be very confusing to keep up with characters, which makes remembering those who appear more than once difficult. However, BP is able to keep the focus on (a) central character(s) at a time, which prevents it from becoming an incomprehensible mess. The most difficult aspect is determining where in the chronological context each story and scene fits, but that's also part of the fun.To say the animation in BP is ""unique"" is an understatement. The entire series (save one episode) is told with a vignette effect - a black circle around its edges. Along with it, is a drab and incredibly limited color palette. You'll mostly see shades of brown, black, and white. This presentation is done on purpose, partly to create a hazy dream world and a stark contrast with the finale. Where Lain relied on dark/light themes with bright colors to create a psychedelic, disconnected tone, BP uses its own brand of minimalism to create a similar one. A blurry haze is common throughout and some scenes are so dark as to make it nearly impossible to tell what's happening. Viewers will either love or hate this style. While I really don't care for it, it is completely unique and quite effective. Such minimal animation and color means that there isn't much beauty to be found in the visuals. But the trade-off is the superb atmosphere it creates.The music is perhaps a weak point as there's very little of it. However, I really enjoy both the opening (especially) and ending themes. The sound, however, is the focus. Multiple effects are used to create eerie sounds which work extremely well within the context of the visuals. The acting is well done (in the sub), if perhaps unspectacular. The dialogue can get a bit windy at times, and some of the themes are trite and shallow - ""Why am I alive? We all just die anyway."" for example. But it's the stories, tone, and narrative that sucks you in. There's something extremely hypnotic about BP that I can't quite put my finger on. It's not so much that I enjoy the series itself as I enjoy being involved in the dream it creates. It's been called a ""horror"", but it's not scary or frightening in the traditional sense. I really think BP defies genre tags as I'm not sure what to label it at all.This is a series like Lain that viewers will likely either love or hate. Much like Lain I found it as equally frustrating as it was intriguing. The complex narrative and atmosphere the series creates is undoubtedly the highlights. I feel that BP resolves itself a bit better than Lain did, with superior pacing and narrative design. However, I preferred Lain's animation and depth of themes that it weaved into the story. I think I'd put the two on about equal ground, and which you prefer would be entirely personal. I think I slightly prefer Boogiepop Phantom as I found myself understanding it better on the 2nd viewing, where much of Lain seems opaque for the sake of being obfuscatory.The extras are minimal. There is director's commentary and some music videos. But the best is the Production and Character notes on Disc 4. This details the many characters in BP and even provides a bit of an aid for those who don't know about the Boogiepop universe.Overall, this is one of the truly unique works in the world of Anime. Its originality alone is a quality making it worth your time. In a world where most of anime has become stagnant, I thoroughly appreciate works like this that break the mold and stand out from all the banal imitations.",Boogiepop Phantom Thinpak Collection

1109942,"I attended the Beyonce concert when she came to Denver this past August and was blown away! This woman entertains! I was worried that the DVD wouldn't be able to fully capture the excitement of the show, but it does that and more. There are few women who can command a stage for two hours.The disc opens with Beyonce asking the audience if they are ""...ready to be entertained?!"" She doesn't disappoint as she launches into ""Crazy in Love"" and the sexy ""Freakum Dress"". She holds court as she gives you the full range of her catalogue: first some of her more popular solo material, then her work with former group-mates Destiny's Child, and finally more material from her newest release. Performed live, all of these songs sound fresh, when on record some of the material can seem kind of dated (i.e. 'Bug-a boo', No No No).My only problems with the disc / concert were few. The addition of 'Flaws and All' detracts from the excitement of the show as Beyonce's vocal histrionics and simulated tears add nothing to the performance. We all know that Beyonce has a good voice, but she tends to over sing on 'Flaws and All' and 'Dangerously in Love'. As a performer, she is decidedly more Tina Turner than Whitney Houston and she should embrace that. The great thing about that is that she is well on her way to being a great performer in the same way as Tina Turner because she totally gives you all of herself in these two hours. The only other part of the DVD that was upsetting is that there are no extras on it at all.In all, this is an excellent purchase for the Beyonce novice or even a longtime fan. Though here in Denver we weren't treated to the guest appearance by Jay Z (of course), I am otherwise completely satisfied with this show. I look forward to more performances by this very talented young woman in the future!",The Beyoncé Experience - Live!
266510,"To quote the amazon.com editorial review, ""Ranking No. 21 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, this 1940 classic is a bit dated in its noble sentimentality"".Now in 2007 it drops to 23rd place on AFIs list and a point i find that people don't bring up is the welfare system and how in that respect it is more important today than ever in showing why and for who a welfare system is in place for and how terribly flawed and manipulated it is today.I know this movie is a classic and won oscars and was directed by one of the great directors John Ford.  Most know the story, or had to read it in high school, and it makes most best lists.  It is a history lesson and teaches unionization, and it is all these things.The thing that stuck with me the most was the end and what a safe haven the agricultural farm put in place by the government was for the Joads.  It safed there lives.  There were dances and they could eat and help pay there way by helping in the camp.  However the Joads did not want a hand out and even though if work came after all they had been through, starvation, losing family members, treated like pigs, they deserved the right to stay in that safe camp, nobody would criticize them for not jumping at the first job that came along that might turn out to be another nothing.As soon as 20 days of work came up they packed everything they owned into that car that might not even make their destination and they left the government camp, and happily.  All they wanted to do was work and they basically were taken advantage of and walked on and not allowed to do the one thing they wanted.In 2007 we have totally healthy and able bodied people in there early twenties collecting social security, or waiting for the end of the month for the welfare check to come in.  Perhaps have more and more children because that check at the end of the month will be fatter.  I knew a kid when i was in the national guard that unknowingly to the government stayed with his girlfriend on welfare rent free while he worked, he actually said he loved the ghetto and he d stay there forever.  I actually liked him barring the last ignorant statement but he was young and i'm guessing didn't have the best influences to think like that.  The Joads didn't have money to eat but you can bet most now a day that are able bodied and can work and choose not to will get there cigarettes.  Say you get involved with drugs mess yourself up and you can't work well then you can get disability.So with everything this movie is, in this day and age that is the message that rang loudest to me.  I also realize there are many like the Joads today that fall upon hard times and a government assisted program is a safe haven to them also, and i am not judging all, but talking about the one's that are manipulating and taking advantage.Perhaps before you are allowed to go on housing or welfare maybe it should be mandatory to watch The Grapes of Wrath and the Joads struggle.",N/A
122454,"Some people may be led astray by the multitude of glowing reviews of this movie on amazon and nearly every other review medium ever. It enjoys classic status for some reason that I cannot fathom, because I am of the opinion that this movie might be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The movie begins with a woman and her husband moving into a new apartment in the swanky (but purportedly cursed) part of town. They are immediately welcomed by their neighbors who happen to be the sweetest little geriatric satanists you ever did see, and begin having dinner with them every night. During one of their dinners, Rosemary is drugged by her husband and the satanists and raped by her husband while she dreams of having sex with JFK and the devil (who looks kind of like a sasquatch) intermittently. But don't get your hopes up, because the movie doesn't get any scarier or intellectually involving from there. It drags along for something around two hours while Rosemary debates over drinking daily concoctions provided for her by the satanists (hmmm... tough call), wearing the charm they've given her (which at this point, she's discovered to be evil, but it somehow remains a tough decision about what to do with it other than wear it and be afflicted by its curse), and just plain moping around while she carries the devil's sasquatch baby.The movie picks up for a brief 30 seconds when Rosemary finds out that her closet opens a secret passage into the Satanists' lair, where the whole crew of octogenarian devil-worshipers halfheartedly mumble ""hail satan"" and Rosemary gets to see her baby... a quick 2 second shot of the eyes of what is obviously an adult wearing red contacts and fur.Does this sound like the kind of movie for you? If so, you might want to get your head checked.",N/A

The 1992 production heightens the story's powerful libretto with its dramatic visual design and first class musical performances.Puccini: La Fanciulla del WestLorin Maazel conducts this cast in Jonathan Miller's 1991 production of the compelling and evocative opera, which Puccini himself considered his best work.Pergolesi: Lo frate nnamoratoRediscovered by conductor Riccardo Muti, this forgotten opera was filmed in the 1989 period production. A rare recording of Pergolesi's second opera.Mozart: Cosi fan tutteDaniela Dess&igrave; and Delores Ziegler lead the cast in Mozart's brilliant and witty opera as the two women whose faithfulness in the face of romantic love is ruthlessly tested in Da Ponte's comic tale.

June Anderson is an outstanding Elena (the Lady of the Lake) in the 1992 production of the melodrama based on Sir Walter Scott's poem.Verdi: AttilaRiccardo Muti conducts a fine cast in the powerful and atmospheric 1991 production of Verdi's ninth opera, whose story of the heroic tussle between Ezio, a Roman general, and Attila, the Nordic invader, was written for the 1846 Teatro la Fenice season and premiered there to huge acclaim.Cilea: Adrianna LecouvreurCilea's four act opera of jealousy and tangled love, first performed in Milan in 1902, is based on the true story of Adriana Lecouvreur, an 18th Century actress at the Comedie Franaise, whose rival for the love of Maurizio, Count of Saxony, is the married Principessa die Bouillon.This was a wonderful set that I got from Amazon. When you break it down you are only paying around $6.50 per opera dvd. I love to go to the opera just like any other opera fan, but you can pay anywhere from $40 to $80 for one viewing.

63267,"All Quiet on the Western Front is an excellent adaptation of the Erich Maria Remarque novel about the horrors of war. It follows several German students from the classroom into the trenches as they die one by one. The story features many random stories depicting one boy, Paul Malvern's (Lew Ayres) experiences similarly to the way the book was organized. There are many powerful scenes, like boys going mad in the trenches, the sickening experience of the boys' first battle, and Paul killing a man up close.Because this film was made at the beginning of the ""golden age of Hollywood,"" viewers might expect it to be highly sentimental and preachy. Although its anti-war message is blatant, it is surprisingly underplayed and straight-forward.The first few times I tried to watch this film I was put off almost immediately. The sound quality suffers because the film was made so early in the talkie era. The opening scene where the teacher preaches to the students about the glories of war is a bit long.

These four films are excellent little mysteries, short and sweet with plenty of gusto. They are a bit childish because of the age of the characters; teenagers today would never act the way these teens do. However, if one can ignore that, the movies are highly enjoyable and great for all ages.First, we have Nancy Drew: Detective, a film about an elderly benefactor who plans to donate much of her fortune to the girls' school that Nancy attends. Before she can donate the money, though, she disappears. Nancy is positive she has been kidnapped, despite the little evidence to support the claim. Along with the help of Ted Nickerson (Frankie Thomas) and her lawyer father (John Litel), she finds that there is a plot afoot, and it might be more dangerous than she originally suspected.In Nancy Drew: Reporter, Nancy switches her throw-away assignment for the local newspaper in favor of a murder trial. She knows that the woman is innocent, even though the evidence is stacked against her. If only Nancy could get her father to represent the case! But as always, Nancy takes things into her own hands, and ropes Ted into the deal.Nancy Drew can't stand the sight of her father falling for a woman in Nancy Drew: Troubleshooter. They venture to the country so her father can work on a case against his friend, Nancy's ""Uncle Matt,"" who has been accused of murder. They're safe, until they find the body of the missing man, and unfortunately the evidence is against good-old Matt. Nancy is suspicious as always, and looks into things a little deeper. With the help of a stereotypical servant named Apollo, she sees that the case is much more complicated than her father realizes.The film with the most exciting title is Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase. Two elderly ladies are started when a murder occurs in their home despite no access for an intruder to commit the crime. They fear paranormal activity because they have been hearing strange noises coming from the basement. They cannot leave unless they want to lose possession of their home because of some technicalities in a will that gave them the house.

1077342,"For a long time I thought Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was an arty, removed kind of director. Thanks to DVDs like the ones in this edition it slowly dawns on me that he was extremely prolific and was also adept at tackling different genres. Gran Casino is a kind of a melodrama with humor and songs - it reminded me of Hollywood movies of the 1930s. A lot of the action takes place in the night club cum casino. There is a very long take of a singer who descends the stage, making her way through the audience along the periphery of the room and back to the stage, all the time singing, while the camera performs a 360 degree turn - it's very neat. The main character is a singer from Argentina, she performs a few of the best known tangos accompanied by a moody but competent pianist. There even is a tiny surrealist element: one dance number is performed with the dancers clutching tiny electrical torches which are absolutely out of place and do not seem to belong to the period the movie is set in. With those torches they pick out members of the audience.The Young Ones is a very beautifully filmed drama in English concerning the coming of age of a girl in a very removed place. The girl reminded me a little of the movie Nell. An African American who has to run from an enraged mob seems to be the first real contact with the outside world.

In any case, it even seems that the future may be brighter than ever.

They hit gold by casting the face of Apple, Justin Long, who has the keys to our generations humor. He is the embodiment of sarcasm that typifies the younger generation. And seeing him with old timer Bruce Willis, really makes some relieving humor to go along with the trademark, impossible action sequences.When watching a Die Hard movie, you overlook, otherwise serious movie action goofs, such as taking out a helicopter with a car, because that's the ticket you bought.

1086848,"The Condemned is essentially a remake of The Most Dangerous Game, an epic book by Richard Connell, about a hunter trapped on an island and begins hunting humans.This has a twist, however, and the story is a bizarre but effective twist between Ray Liotta's ""No Escape"" and Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""The Running Man"".  Where Ice T and Rutger Hauer failed with ""Surviving the Game"", this movie takes off and excels.An eccentric tv producer who has been shunned by the rest of the industry puts together this deathmatch, and he plans on making a lucrative profit by broadcasting it over the web, charging everyone for entry.  It's a 24-hour a day hunting channel, reality show, and sporting match.Stone Cold Steve Austin plays an American Special Forces soldier who has to use all his skill, training, and wits to survive against some of the most insane murderers and pathological killers on the planet. Unfortunately, during a mission in a foreign country, he was imprisoned.  How unfortunate...""The Condemned"" taps into raw emotion, as 10 condemned prisoners from various, vile prisons around the worldd, are purchased with the intention of their unwilling entry into a life or death struggle.  The game is simple: be the last prisoner alive, and get set free.  All others die.  In an interesting twist, another Rutger Hauer movie is tapped into (Deadlock), as each prisoner on the island has explosives strapped to their ankles.  In a short period of time, the explosive device will detonate, and the only way to get it off is to win the competition.The drama and action build as prisoners die one by one, leaving only the strongest to do battle.  Who will survive?  Watch and find out.",The Condemned

Thank god for the quick turn-around of Netflix or I would've been mad about paying to see this instead of just highly disappointed. I can't speak for the rest of the cast, but I know Amber Benson is capable of much better than this. The so-called plot gave the cast nothing to work with, the direction stank, the sets were so obviously cheap, and the ""special effects"" were the lamest of the lame.I once heard Amber Benson spoke of one of her other films, Taboo, and told people not to pay to see it because it was so bad.

I have heard that the original opening actually began with Dillon on Boot Hill, either before OR after the opening credits and I have not been able to find out what the actual opening credits looked like.I have heard also that they used a six gun aimed at the camera and fired a shot which exuded large amounts of gunsmoke.Does anyone out there have any info??",Gunsmoke: Season 1
191504,"I happened to catch this masterpiece again and was struck by how well it holds up. Although it has majestic sweep, and it is everything that an epic should be, it is in the small details that it proves faultless. One example stands out. Duvall is looking out over the plains at a herd of buffalo. He goes to chasing the herd and then comes racing back followed by a band of Indians. Just in this sequence, we go from the big dreams of the frontier to the tragic injuries that will take his life. The movie is filled with moments like this; actually, there are dozens of them given the length of the piece. So tied to this role is Duvall in my mind that I have trouble now enjoying him in anything else. He has those mannerisms - his way of sucking in air to control his emotions - that I associate with his part in this series and not with him as an actor. I can't think of a dramatic epic as well made. It was in fact both the best and the last of these mini-series. After ""Lonesome Dove"" the only great television has been the Ken Burns docudramas such as his recent ""War.""",N/A
1099471,"The latest installment of comic book super heroes to jump from ink to the big screen is another big budget action fest. This time out, we find the Fantastic 4 fighting an alien invader, the Silver Surfer. The special effects are no less then great. The story is better then I would have expected from this popcorn film. While it is no citizen Kane, it did do its job; it held my interest and entertained me for 90 plus minutes. I'm not a super big fan of the comic book; I did read it from time to time as a teenager. I can't say if they are being true to the original or not. But if Stan Lee is willing to put his stamp of approval on it, that is good enough for me. Plus I'm not one of those super nerds that has never seen a woman naked so it was ok.Well, here it is; the bad news. The main down fall is the acting. While not all the performances came up short, Michael Chiklis is great as the thing as is most of the cast. The weak link in the acting chain is Ms. Jessica Alba. Like the rest of the red blooded American male population, I think she is super hot. That said; I have to say she can't act her way out of a bad soap opera. I think in whatever movie she is in next; she should play a mute in a bikini. She is great to look at, but once she opens her mouth to say any thing it obliterates the illusion.All said; I have to give this film two thumbs up.

1015377,"Road to Guantanamo is a movie about the inhumane conditions inflicted on three Muslim men who spent almost three years at the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba. This movie is part drama and part documentary. The majority of the film uses dramatizations of the actual events with actors playing three Muslim Englishmen and the military personnel who capture them. The remaining parts of the movie include actual interviews with the three guys and some archive footage of Donald Rumsfeld, George W. Bush, and others.Directors Michal Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross attempt to tackle a very large, controversial subject with Road to Guantanamo and rather than stick to the usual documentary formula of expert testimony, archive footage, and interviews, they decided to try something a little different. Using actors, this docu- drama attempts to let the outside world see what conditions are like inside Guantanamo Bay. The prisoners who suffer at the hands of the military personnel number far more than Asif, Ruhal, and Shafiq. Like the dramatizations show, most everyone at this military base was subject to daily doses of humiliation, physical pain, and mental torture as different captors tried to extract confessions of guilt from the three men and those around them.Among the scenes in this movie, the ones that are most memorable are those taken at prison (a dramatization- it wasn't really filmed there). Watch in disgust as the military people rough up uncooperative prisoners; force the men to sit in physically uncomfortable positions; force the men to listen to loud, blaring music; deny them of their right to pray each day; etc. And, of course, there was plenty of dishonesty on the part of the military personnel when it came time to interrogate. Why was all of this done? To try to get one or all of the men to confess to having some involvement in the Al Qaeda led attacks on September 11, 2001, or to at least obtain some information about Osama Bin Laden and where he might be hiding. Most viewers will find this part of the film moving, regardless of whether or not they agree with this type of interrogation. Personally, I don't like the way things are handled when it comes to POW's and interrogation but, on the other hand, this is war and during war you cannot always be nice and friendly to your captives, especially when you are trying to get information from them that could lead to the arrest of a known killer.This docu- drama is intended to illustrate the horrors of war and the human rights abuses that often take place when prisoners of war are interrogated. It fulfills its task effectively in some ways but not in others. The scenes taken from the prison are among the best in the film, even if they are performed by actors, because they let the world see what it was like to spend time in these prisons as an innocent person. I know that many have denied the human rights abuses at Guantanamo Bay but I think what this docu- drama portrays is pretty accurate. The reason I say this is because the conditions depicted, while nasty and certainly undesirable, are not nearly as bad as they could be and they don't come close to the torture inflicted on POW's in other countries. In other words, I don't think anyone can say that the alleged conditions displayed in this movie are exaggerated. They seem to be right on the mark and while they are nothing to be proud of, they are not as horrifying as the stories told by POW's from other wars, like Vietnam.As far as the viewpoints offered, Road to Guantanamo doesn't offer a balanced picture by any stretch and this should come as no surprise to anyone since the goal of this docu- drama is to gain sympathy for these three innocent men (and others like them) who lost nearly three years of their lives in a military prison. But this lack of any balance is one of the movie's downfalls. Not only is there no counter argument from military personnel, there is no commentary from any one else except the three men themselves. It is nice that these three men are willing to come forward and offer their take on the brutality of war but the movie would have been much more effective if it included at least some commentary by others; like, say, human rights experts, political analysts, military experts, etc. The viewing public fully expects the three men who were held captive to have nothing but negative things to say about the experience. We expect that. But it takes more than one side to make a documentary of this type believable and the filmmakers should have expanded the movie to include commentary from others as further proof of the film's conclusions.Another thing I'm not too happy with about Road to Guantanamo is the DVD; specifically, the lack of extras. The only things you get on the DVD are a scene selection option, previews, and other usual things you get on all DVD's. Here, once again, the directors blew a golden opportunity. The movie makes you want to know more about this controversy and the directors could have fulfilled that curiosity and added to the film's credibility with some educational DVD extras. But they don't offer anything to satisfy the viewer's cravings for more information.The three men portrayed in this documentary did win release from prison in 2004 and the charges were dismissed. They each maintained their innocence which was later proven true. They kept their spirits throughout this time of injustice and they have now emerged stronger than ever. Each of the men talks at length on this documentary about the experience and they claim that their personal character and Muslim faith are now impenetrable thanks to the negative experience at Guantanamo Bay.Overall, Road to Guantanamo is a pretty good film with an important message about POW and the proper way to treat them. It is very one- sided and inconsistent and it falls short of the great documentary it could have been because of its lack of expert testimony and other persuasive/educational material. But it is still a good documentary/drama about the horrors of life as a POW and it is worth a watch.",N/A

1045076,"The Nativity Story covers the biblical events of the nativity in a way that is accurate, personable and encouraging.  The only real major fault with the film is in portrarying the wise men as coming to visit Jesus the night of Jesus' birth.  Most scholars believe the wise men probably came quite a bit later.  The Gospel of Matthew does not dwell on the birth of Jesus. Matthew simply records ""After Jesus was born..."" Magi from the east came..."" asking about the birth.  Then King Herod began to search the scriptures to pinpoint the birth.  He then relied on the Magi to go to Bethlehem to search out the child who had been born.  The Magi found Joseph, Mary and Jesus in a ""house,"" and not the stable where Jesus had been born.  The Magi were then warned in a dream not to go back to Herod.  When they didn't return Herod gave orders to kill all boys in Bethlehem who were ""two years old and under"" in an apparent attempt to kill Jesus.  Since there is a big difference between a newborn and a 2 year old, it is reasonable to conclude that Jesus was no longer an infant.",N/A

1043374,"The experience of seeing ""Off the Black"" did what very few films have done for me lately; it left me with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face.Within seconds, literally, we are introduced to young Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan). He's standing on the pitcher's mound, sweat beaded on his brow, studying the catcher's signals. His face completely fills the screen, as if the director is saying, ""here you go. If you don't like what you see, this will be tough for you. If you do, sit back and watch the story develop."" The story is that of a relationship between Dave and someone else, of course. But that someone is no blonde bombshell or voluptuous vixen. The other half of that relationship is Ray Cook (Nick Nolte), the ump standing behind home plate. But this is not ""Brokeback Baseball,"" no, although surely that may enter your mind. It's something else. It's something rarely explored in American cinema, and it's bold and daring. It's a love story -- a good old-fashioned romance between two individuals who just happen to be male, and it's totally platonic. ""Is this possible?"" you may ask. It sure is, and ""Off the Black"" will prove it to you.This film is made with passion and care. The soft, natural lighting of the interiors allows the full mystery of the characters to flourish. Single point lighting allows interplay of light and shadow which echoes the bright and dark sides of Dave and Ray, as well as the family members who surround them. Dave's father Tom (Timothy Hutton), withdrawn and distant. Sister Ashley (Sonia Feigelson), on the cusp of adulthood, gawky and afraid. All have secrets to tell, but don't, or won't, or can't. Cinematographer Tim Orr manages to find beauty in every little thing -- contrails, dripping gutters, siding and eaves and gently sloping roofs. And the countryside -- oh my. The lush scenery of the Catskills is indescribable. The setting is supposed to be Ponsoldt's Georgia home. But it could be anywhere where sea and sky and small towns predominate. Some of the shots are literally breathtaking. I found myself gasping several times. But what tugged at my heart even more was the sparse, almost homespun soundtrack. Punctuated by the occasional train whistle in the distance, the music never distracted, never shouted, ""this is important."" The contrast between the beauty of the setting and the ugliness of the fractured individuals who populate it is stark. It is on this canvas that writer-director James Ponsoldt, in his first feature, crafts a work of art that is simply one of the most poignant love stories imaginable. The protagonists meet, get tangled in tension and deception, and finally fall in love. Occasionally that's followed by breakup and tragedy. Ponsoldt has said that he actually wrote the film as a romantic love story. It just happened to be played by two male actors and is platonic.To be honest, the film can be hard to watch at times. Nolte's portrayal of the seldom sober Ray is unsettling and painful, like a bad toothache that you can't wait to be pulled. Morgan's sensitive, vulnerable, sad-eyed Dave is like a puppy cowering beneath Ray's rolled up newspaper. But the bravado falls away on Ray's part, the sarcastic self-confidence and humor emerges from Dave, and the boy who needs a father draws closer to the man who needs a son. Finally, what makes this film so joyful to watch is the interplay between the two. It is all so natural that it seemed unscripted. As it turned out, much of it was. Ponsoldt has admitted that he gave free reign to Nolte and Morgan quite often, and some of the best lines in the film were theirs and theirs alone. And only the best directors are willing to step back and let that happen. And only the best actors can pull it off. Most will not be surprised at Nolte's performance -- he is, after all, a veteran if there ever was one. But ""Off the Black"" could be the vehicle which puts Trevor Morgan on filmgoers' radar, if it's not already. I'd seen his work before (he was Ponsoldt's first choice, largely based on his performance in the indie classic ""Mean Creek""), but he carries this film so confidently and easily that it left me shaking my head in wonderment. And with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face. ""Off the Black"" will do that to you.",Off the Black

Alvin learns that doing something good often leads to difficult situations when Dave books him a concert where he is supposed to play said harmonica.  Simon and Theodore attempt to help Alvin raise the money for a new harmonica and even this gesture works up Dave's ire (as he believes Alvin only wants the money for himself, which is only partly correct).The special is brief, twenty-five minutes or so without commercials, but is packed with humor, heart, and several songs that are a delight to hear.Young audiences will enjoy it just as much as the ones who grew up watching the special when it originally aired.The DVD also comes with two Christmas-themed episodes of the second animated series.

Clearly the filmmakers realized that most people, like me, didn't actually read ""Skipping Christmas"", but glanced at the last line in a bookstore at some point...Yes, this is a mediocre movie.  However, I think the level of vitriol in some of the reviews it has received, both on Amazon and elsewhere, is absurd.  I love Roger Ebert and his books collecting negative reviews, but he reviewed ""Christmas with the Kranks"" as though it were a cultural document of the utmost significance.  It's just a silly holiday movie!One thing I certainly did not like about ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was the sequence of Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis visiting a tanning salon.  People who use tanning salons greatly increase their risk of skin cancer, and I did not appreciate the depiction of this risky behavior on the part of responsible adult characters in a family comedy.

Outdoing the intensity (and certainly the gore) of its predecessor, the sequel retains much of the jumpy scares and all of the terrifying zombies, but focuses more on visceral action and horrifying violence, and brings a welcome unpredictability to its frenzied survival story. 28 Days Later you may fear those corrupted by chaos. 28 Weeks Later you will fear those infected by Rage.Twenty-eight weeks after the initial Rage Virus outbreak finds London occupied by the American military and a heavy quarantine in place. Those that survived begin to rebuild their world in seclusion, and after several months of no sign of the virus and all those originally infected dead to starvation, hopeful tranquility appears to return. But such serenity was not meant to last, and when a father with a dark past is reunited with his children, tragic events unfold that rapidly lead to another outbreak of the Rage. Once again an epidemic of voracious zombies threatens London, and those trapped between the ruthless military and their drastic precautions will find little solace amongst the carnivorous abominations that roam the streets.When 28 Days Later premiered, horror fans the world over praised it for its new breed of zombie with a familiar penchant for human flesh, but also a new, extremely aggressive and violent temperament. Combined with an enhanced agility and speed, Danny Boyle's unique twist on the undead fiend became far more terrifying than Romero's original design. While Days used his vicious creatures almost as a backdrop for the more diabolical workings of his corrupted military, Weeks takes full advantage of these cannibalistic crazies to produce some truly shocking horror scenes. The opening sequence perfectly outlines just how deadly the infected are as they overwhelm the small group of survivors and dispatch them in a quick and brutal fashion. From there each encounter becomes even more panic-inducing as Fresnadillo utilizes several ingenious tension-building devices, from the shaky handheld cameras to the foreboding music. One standout scene finds the protagonists in a pitch-black subway station with the only light source being a sniper rifle night-vision scope. In a wonderfully chaotic moment all hell breaks loose and we are witness to a riveting fight for survival where we feel as helpless as our heroes thanks to Enrique Chediak's camerawork and the frantic editing.With the increased zombie screen time comes a far higher level of blood and gore and both are handled well to enhance the gravity of the survivors' plight. Throats are torn, eyes are gouged, and heads explode to reveal a sadistic amount of bloodletting that will have gorehounds cheering and the squeamish fleeing. Partway through the film a helicopter decapitation reminiscent of Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror can be found, but here it's no longer an over-the-top splatter of body parts, but rather an exercise in some truly horrific bloodshed.Though different in focus from its predecessor, 28 Weeks Later builds upon Boyle's original concept to create a terrifyingly appropriate sequel that carries on a series of horror films that redefines the zombie. No more are the shambling, brainless denizens of the night - here the undead possess an unparalleled speed and ferocity that only the most heavily armed (and fortunate) can hope to escape. Arguably superior to the original, 28 Weeks Later is a triumphant return to a remarkably frightening world lost to both those in power and those immune to it, where death can descend upon you in the blink of a bloody eye - if you're one of the lucky ones.- Joel Massie",28 Weeks Later

1046892,"Sometimes, this season is considered the weakest season but in my opinion it features many of what would be my favorite episodes. The first few episodes are rather run of the mill - though ""Amen .. send money"" is a great episode but is different to other MV - and certainly ""The big thaw"" is terrible, but ""Child's play"" and ""God's work"" are very strong and inventive episodes. ""Missing hours"" is often cited as the worst episode of all but while this is clearly not MV in style, it is the kind of stuff people would be watching later on ""Twin peaks"" or ""X-Files"". I like the Caitlin Davies episodes (Crockett's revenge on Frank Hackman - that episode is one of the best ever MV episodes imo) and ""Mirror image"", where Sonny loses his mind after his Caitlin's death. ""Bad of dishonor"", ""Indian wars"" and ""Hell hath no fury"" are great action-packed episodes. The anti-Pinochet episode ""Baseballs of death"" is not only fiction but shows the kind of people the West supported against communism (this is the best political episode since ""Stones war"" in season 3).The only problem with season four is there are about 4 very pointless episodes (the boring ""Vote of confidence"", the ridiculous ""Cows of October"" and ""The big thaw"" and - if you want to - ""Missing hours"" (the strongest of these 4 actually!)) that sometimes were back to back.

It is the younger actors who are not that wonderful in their respective roles.More relevant than ever, the movie does a good job as an eye-opener to the darkest regime out there.

I think the film is a bit confusing the first time around because one needs to keep track of the names of the characters and the plot.

995036,"I always liked this show, but then I had read up on it beforehand and knew that it was not going to be another Law & Order type show. I knew was written for a younger audience than the traditional viewers of the L&O; franchise, and that it would be featuring more of the personal lives of the young attorneys. I felt it was a little confused at first, but that it had found its moorings by the close of the season and I was disappointed that it was not renewed for a second season. It had potential. Its two downfalls were, first off, that people who tuned in were probably expecting a Law & Order type show, and when they didn't get it, didn't continue to tune in. Secondly, it also had a deadly timeslot - Saturday night - when many of its target demographic are not watching TV.  If you liked the organization of ""The Practice"", you'd probably enjoy this series. Nobody else listed the episodes, so I do that next:Pilot - Nick Potter leaves his law firm to join the New York District Attorney's office which is currently investigating a known drug dealer. Meanwhile, Finn loses key evidence for her case. Soon an assistant D.A. is gunned down and it turns out that another A.D.A. might be involved.Denial - Steele has to prosecute a 14 year old boy as an adult after he killed his brother with a baseball bat. Peluso must investigate why a high school athlete commited a hate crime. Rossi tries to get a prostitute to testify at a sexual assault trial and Finn gets ready for her blind date.Breakup - Finn has to investigate why a mother said her daughter was dying of cancer because the autopsy done after she supposedly commited suicide proves otherwise. Potter's friend is arrested for cocaine possession, but when his friend comes to him for help, Potter sends him to Desmond. Meanwhile, Cabot begins an anti-drug campaign.Indebted - Desmond has to prosecute a well-known rap producer who has been charged with murder. Nick Potter goes on a ride along with two ghetto cops, landing Potter in a meeting with Internal Affairs; Jessica Rossi prosecutes a wife beater, while wrestling with the same problem at home, when her mother tells her she's leaving her father for being abusive, and Christina Finn gets caught up in a case with a spoiled diplomat's son and a strip club.Savasanna -  Finn has to deal with a shaken baby case. Even though his boss wants him to settle a case, Potter says no, but wins anyway. Desmond has a one night stand with a woman from the courthouse. Steele ends up canceling a date with Rossi, but then gets intimate with Cabot moments before she makes a big announcement.Madness - Desmond spends time working in a psychiatric ward. Peluso is pressured by his newly reunited girlfriend. Finn is loaned out to a cruel prosecutor. Potter fills in for Desmond on a bail reduction case with terrible results. Rossi deals with a family battle concerning a deaf girl's boyfriend stabbing her father.True Love - Potter ends up being beaten at gunpoint after trying to get a witness to testify.

320452,"Although working conditions and terms don't create genius, it sure can inhibit and even destroy its expression. Buster Keaton and his experience at MGM are Exhibit A of that scenario. Chaplin, however, was in complete creative control of almost his entire career. After his early Keystone shorts, Chaplin never again starred in someone else's film production. In short, nobody could ever say ""no"" to his creative ideas and make it stick. Thus we can look at the films in this collection and lay any blame or applause entirely at the feet of Charles Chaplin, and that circumstance is as unique as Chaplin the artist himself.It's very hard to describe this excellent set in the context of Chaplin's genius and his evolution as a film maker, because the films are separated from one another by quite large time intervals and interim films that are in volume two, with the exception of Modern Times and The Great Dictator which were sequential projects. ""The Gold Rush"" shows Chaplin's talent at comedy and pathos set in the heart of the silent era (1925) after he had already had some success making silent feature films. ""Modern Times"" is perhaps the best film he ever made, again a silent picture, long after silent films had gone out of vogue in Hollywood (1936). If anything, as time passes, Modern Times just becomes more and more relevant. ""The Great Dictator"" (1940) is Chaplin's first talking picture, and today, given the benefit of the knowledge of what was really going on in Germany during this time, the film almost seems in bad taste. However, even Chaplin admitted that if he had really known the extent of what was happening in Europe at the time he probably would not have made the film. Still, Chaplin turns in a fine performance in a great film where the best parts still involve Chaplin's gift of pantomime. Finally, there is Limelight (1952), which is a very sentimental film that has Chaplin perhaps looking back on his own career and showing what he was truly afraid of having happen - that he would someday be seen as a relic of the past and that only when people were told ""who he used to be"" would he be appreciated or for that matter even welcome. Thus it is really necessary to watch the films in volume 2 to fill in the blanks between the four movies in this collection and get a true picture of Chaplin the artist. Highly recommended.",N/A

263491,"I loved Jerry Lewis movies as a kid, but naturally lost interest as I grew older and it seemed the movies simultaneously declined in quality while Jerry became increasingly annoying as a pontificating pseudo-intellectual.  However his early work was interesting as he tried different things (silence in The Bellboy for example) and he made a couple of fine comedies early on.  I have always found parts of It's Only Money and The Ladies Man hilarious. Many feel The Nutty Professor to be his best, and it has some good stuff, but I have always been partial to the all-out, anything-goes assault of gags in The Ladies Man, one of his best efforts.  Also the shmaltz and sentimentality that marred so much of his later films is, for the most part, thankfully absent here.Comedy, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and you cannot fake a laugh.  You either find a non-sequiter throw-away joke like the bit with the door cited above funny, or you don't.  Likewise many of the non-stop gag setups and deliveries here will crack you up or they won't.  Of course it's silly.  It was meant to be silly.  Silly done well, is just fine.There are some great bits here: the opening ""heartbreak"" scene (hilariously exaggerated); the butterflies; the other ""pain"" jokes (the toaster); ""baby""; the dance with George Raft; the surreal encounter with Miss Cartilage; the ""sound test"" with Doodles Weaver;  the intrusions into Mrs. Wellonmellon's TV show and so on.  And if none of the above make you laugh, there is the one certified classic routine of the ""hat bit"" with Buddy Lester doing his patented ""slow-burn"".Jerry made good use of the elaborate set and his direction here is as concise and appropriate as possible.  As to the DVD, unfortunately, on the Commentary Jerry offers a few useful insights, but Steve Lawrence seems to be there just to say ""Great Jer"" after every bit.  Egregious, but I suppose they don't watch many DVD's, and fail to understand what a Commentary is about.  Take the 5 stars in context.",Ladies Man VHS

931745,"OK, I'm pretty easy going when it comes to this type of film. I never expect too much--I don't expect redeeming value, I don't expect character development, I don't expect great acting. Heck, most of the time--I don't even expect much of a story. Having caught Alexandre Aja's effective remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" I was more than willing to give this French (but poorly dubbed) entry in the slasher genre a chance. Well, now, I'm not really sure if it was worth it.The film has a pretty standard setup. Some have already noticed its similarity to Dean Koontz's ""Intensity,"" which is apt--but that, too, already followed pretty conventional guidelines. As two girls are staying in a desolate family home of one of them, a rural madman comes a knocking. Jumping right into a brutality and unpleasantness, various members of the family are dispatched and/or attacked. One girl manages to elude the madman while the other is taken captive. The film has plenty of effectively tense moments during the ""house"" sequence. It sets itself up as a nasty bit of brutality, but nothing particularly original.Intent on helping her friend, the free girl rides with and/or chases the kidnapper's van for the remainder of the picture. Things get a bit sillier, but it is what it is. You know you're just biding time until the final confrontation. Again, I know there is an audience for this--but as our heroine never displayed much ingenuity, she wasn't really someone I cared about. Mainly the film is ""Hide and Seek"" followed by ""Hide and Seek"" with more ""Hide and Seek"" after that--Not a lot of diversity, I guess I'm saying.Now, then, in the last 15 minutes--the surprise twist is unveiled. I have seen this device used in countless other movies, and it can be a tremendous revelation. But not here. Had it been done with any sort of logic, it might have enhanced the film. I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say that a perfectly detailed film is needed to pull it off. A film where this device is used must be a thing of precision. ""High Tension"" just isn't that movie. The twist here makes sense in the context of the picture, however it is not logically supported by what has transpired. For anyone who thinks it is ingenious, I'd like to sit down, have a cup of coffee, and list the dozens and dozens of inconsistencies that just don't work. That said, it irritated me more than anything. What was going to be a 3 star review for derivative unpleasantness with some chills turned into about 1 1/2 stars for being nonsensical.

657496,"Will Smith is the last man on the Earth. Or is he? You will know the answer in the third (English-speaking feature-length) adaptation of Richard Matheson's famous and influential novella, where Smith's protagonist Robert Neville lives alone in New York City with his faithful dog Sam.When I say alone, he is really alone in Manhattan. The film's first 40 minutes is the greatest part of it where Robert Neville can be seen driving a car wildly in the desert streets of New York City, hunting a herd of wild deer by day, and hiding in a bathroom with his dog by night, hearing weird noises from outside. Obviously he is trying to keep his sanity among the remnants of the civilization that is going to end. Director Francis Lawrence has a clear vision as to how the world would end, not with a bang but with a whimper.Unfortunately, ""I Am Legend,"" some might say, really ends with a whimper. I am saying that it does not have actions - it has - but it is exactly the actions that might be a bit disappointing. They involve shootings, explosions and CGIs, but the film could have taken another approach. (And the new film changed the meaning of the title's ""Legend."") Not that I didn't enjoy watching them, though.The film's location is, as I said, New York City while Matheson's original was set in LA. The change is a good idea as NYC has more recognizable landmarks which the film uses quite effectively during the flashback scenes. Also effective is Will Smith's acting as military scientist Robert Neville (formerly played by Vincent Price and Charlton Heston). His excellent acting makes up for the loss of the apocalyptic story's social undertone represented by ""Dark Seekers.""Uncredited Emma Thompson appears briefly in the film's opening sequence, so don't be late for the show.",I Am Legend

Now we have Children of Men. Skies are stained with smoke, streets are littered since no one cares, and the government ration boxes include suicide kits - the ones advertised on subsidized TV. It's just too believable.I can't say there's a real plot to this movie. It's a small kind of quest, maybe just a trek through concentration camps, buildings burning in urban combat, and scorched earth. Michael Caine puts in a superb performance, since he doesn't know how to do anything else. This time, he's an aging hippie, but also a very brave and pacifist combatant in that war that seems to have no reason, and something even braver for his wife.

I would recommend this film to anyone, especially those who were ""Little House On The Prairie"" fans. I kept thinking throughout the film how much it reminded me of ""Little House"".

There are moments of greatness overflowing with profound and memorable conversation scattered throughout the film. There are also however some spotty moments here and there serving as nothing more than filler material pushing the storyline forward until the next great moment comes along. My favorite sequences in the film involve the appearance of an unnamed character referred to in the credits as ""The Destiny Man"" played by Gilbert Robin. When he's on screen the dialogue is fascinating but these moments are too short and not quite often enough.My Rating: -2  Stars-.",Happenstance
1052776,"In this day and age of ""equal rights"" for all orientations, it is highly refreshing to see such an old-fashioned macho man like Rocky Balboa.  I am quite a fan of Mr. Stallone and his Rocky series, and found Adrian (his wife) to be a strong feminist-type presence.  It is no secret that she is no longer with us, and I worried my well-fed rear off that her absence would hurt the movie.  Not so, as Mr. Stallone handles her passing with great sensitivity - never letting the audience forget how much that tigress meant to him.As a confirmed neo-feminist, I find it perfectly acceptable to desire a strong ol' guy while also maintaining my own identity. The reason, I think, that so many people ended up wanting to see this movie is because in these overly sensitive ""politically correct"" times, there is a strong appeal in seeing such a straight-ahead tough guy who knows what he wants and how he plans to get it without ever compromising who he is nor conceding to the societal pressures that force so many to sell out their own personal integrity.I was a little iffy regarding the character of Marie.  While I applaud Stallone for resisting temptations to fire up a romance between he and Marie, I also felt he was a little too fatherly in his attempts to control her life.  Bravo to her for telling him that he was offering too much, but boo to her for ending up accepting such help.  Not really a part of the neo-femme credo.  Her son Steps was also a little ineffective and wasn't seen learning many lessons in masculinity from Rocky.Back to the subject of grieving a lost spouse, while I have never experienced that harsh reality - I have relatively recently split with a male companion (shouldn't the term 'boyfriend' end with the onset of middle age?). I was heartbroken and remain very depressed as I feel lonely (not to mention that my biological clock is about to stop ticking, and no amount of winding is likely to restart it).  Watching this movie, I was reminded of the type of love I have been close to many times yet somehow have managed to miss. Why are some of us so unlucky? Don't I deserve my own Rocky Balboa??Thank you for indulging me in such a personal take on this movie. I dare not spoil anything about the big fight, but for me it was not all that important.  Stallone crafted an excellent character study and by the time the training sequence begins it is almost beside the point. Not a criticism mind you, it is in fact a huge compliment to the first 70 or so minutes of the movie.  Did I cry?  Yes.  Did I wet myself?  Only a little because of the gargantuan soda I drank throughout the movie.  Kudos to Mr. Stallone, God bless him.",N/A
641990,"Stephen Colbert has included Clive Owen in his list of ""Things That Are Trying To Turn Me Gay,"" and indicates that Mr. Owen is only a little less successful than baby carrots.  I sympathize with Mr. Colbert.  I'd buy and watch anything Clive Owen has done, even that series of high-octane BMW commercials he did back in 2001 and 2002.  There's something about his snarly amiability, his capacity to take the conventionally wry Leading Man attitude and give it a dose of sheltered vulnerability that plays like snarky ambivalence.  But mostly I just want him to hold me.Ha ha ha.  Eh.  Okay, well, all of that having been said, this movie?  Not very good.""Derailed"" is, indeed, a clever little thriller, but it's too big for its britches.  The story sprawls so much that its contrivances seem awkward, and its twists seem more like flow-stopping kinks.  Penned by Stuart Beattie after the man had already given us ""Collateral"" and the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Derailed"" lacks the tight plotting and character-driven nuances of either of those movies.Our story follows a fellow named Charles Schine (Clive Owen) who chances to meet a lovely stranger named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) on his train ride to work.  The two flirt with that sort of soft-toned abrasiveness that comes so easily to the executives of the World of Moviedom (both Schine and Harris' jobs are your typically ill-defined filmic pablum; what they do never matters as much as the fact that its lucrative).  Before they know it, they're slumming it in a moth-eaten motel room and gettin' it on, as they say.Unfortunately, the only one who gets it off, as they say, is the guy who breaks into their room, robs them, and then does unspeakable things in the interim.  The encounter is, indeed, hard to watch, stomach-churning, even if the robber (Vincent Cassel packing his chops with as much cheese as he can) keeps uttering the sort of unimaginative drivel that most movie villains utter in the midst of their bad behavior.  Ah, but can I blame a low life like this for being uncreative?Yes, I can, actually.  Our low life, LaRoche, is actually pretty smart, because the hotel room is just the beginning.  LaRoche, realizing he's attacked a couple of very soft, very wealthy targets, cranks things up a notch, turns the screws, puts the pressure on, ups the ante, hits close to home, ADD METAPHOR HERE.What really ruins ""Derailed"" is its schizophrenic pacing.  Owen is at his greatest when his character has reached an interlude, when a decision must be made.  You can see the dark calculus of his thoughts on his well-angled face, and when he reaches his conclusion, the actions he takes are just an extension of those ruminations.  However, in ""Derailed,"" those moments seem to last forever.  Furthermore, Owen's character is so stupid, so weak, and so spineless, it's hard, by the end, to care what happens to him and his wife and his Dying Daughter (who could be cured by a miraculous new drug that costs as much as Tanzania, apparantly, and for which the Schine's have been saving for seven years; this is known as an Emotional Plug-in).It's great that Owen plays against type in this movie; I'm not faulting him for that.  I am, however, faulting the film for the character it has chosen to place at its center.  Schine's transgressions are understandable, I suppose, and so is his habit of burying all of his problems under a pile of money.  But his actions at the end, the logical leaps he makes in the interim, it's all choreographed inconvenience.  From the cops who inexplicably berate him for not buying a hooker, to LaRoche's perpetually-scowling partner-in-crime (Xzibit, who uses the same facial expression in every frame of the film), to Schine's mail boy, Winston Boyko, an ex-con who still steals from time to time and even has, as a keepsake, the first shiv he ever used to stab someone with (played with companionable charm by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan): it's all hokey and eye-rolling.Of course, the entire movie would fail to exist if Schine would do the one sensible thing and go to the cops, but the script takes great pains to explain why he shouldn't, wouldn't, and doesn't do this.  I never really bought it.  In fact, the further along the film went, the less I bought.  Too much of the movie tries to be clever, tries to circle around into itself.  Its a pile of plot-threads, a tangled mess of consequences and coincidences, and even the great Clive Owen can't save it.But he can still hold me whenever he wants.",N/A
644037,"Stick It is one of those sports films that you come away from seeing feeling that it was better than you thought it would be but could have been so much better.Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a wild child. She was once a gymnast who showed great promise before unexpectedly walked away from the sport. After some troubles at home she is sent to the Vickerman Gymnastics Academy run by the surly Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges). It is here that she must once again prove herself and find a new start.This is not Oscar material but it is a good way to spend a few hours in a darkened theatre. The acting is spotty but acceptable. Peregrym shines as Haley but she comes across as a little to cute to be the punky troublemaker that she is made out to be. Bridges is his usual self and his acting is good but this does not appear to be one of his more challenging roles. There is good support from the actual gymnasts who filled in as doubles for the main characters. The secondary characters are somewhat less well developed but are played decently by Vanessa Lengies (Joanne Charis), Nikki SooHoo (Wei Wei Yong) and Maddy Curley (Mina Hoyt).The film has an MTV feel with lots of cuts and booming soundtrack. It's target audience tween and teenage girls and it will be quite effective with this age group. It even teaches a lesson in that things can be changed by working together to make a difference. First time director Jessica Bendinger has done a fine job with her debut film.The true highlight of this disc resides in its bonus features. The film has two comentaries: one by Bendinger and her primary actresses Lengies and Peregrym, the second by Bendinger and DP, Daryn Okada and editor, Troy Takaki. Also featured are 8 deleted scenes with multiple commentaries, a intoductory featurette of the actual gymnasts who acted as stunt doubles, slowed down uneven bar routines (also with optional comentary); routines performed by the elite gymnasts( with commentary) and two music videos.As mentioned this is not a bad film to see with your family and is definately worth a rental.",N/A

801482,"Heidi Bub, a 29yr old wife and mother living in Tennessee, launches on an overseas journey to find her roots in Vietnam.At age 6, young Hiep is surrendered by her mother to Americans, who, through Operation Babylift, take the Vietnamese children of American military men back to the U.S. to be adopted by American families.Hiep's mother made a noble and heartbreaking sacrifice, surrendering her child because of rumors that all Amerasian children remaining in Vietnam would be burned alive after the war.Hiep was flown to the U.S., adopted by a single woman who moved them to Tennessee, and - at age six - transformed from Hiep into Heidi.At age six, she remembered her previous home, her biological mother and siblings, the trauma of the war. She carried with her no understanding of the sacrifice made by her family -- only the sense of loss and abandonment, and the childlike belief that she must be a bad person to have been left by her mother.When she ultimately split from her adoptive mother, Heidi began to long for her first home, to finally find ""a mother's love"" -- someone who would love and accept her ""just as I am.""When she found her biological mother, she discovered the pretty dreams of reunion and unconditional love could not match reality. Her family was grindingly poor -- something she was clearly not prepared for. They lived with the hopes that she -- an American and someone better off than they -- would rise to her familial obligations and care for the family by providing for them. Cherished Asian values of community and filial duty clash with American values of individualism and privacy. Heidi is insulted by all the talk of money. Conversations center around the family's wish for her monetary help. She cannot meet their expectations, she tells them. She guards her money and her heart and her privacy, wiping off her cheek where her doting mother plants frequent kisses. Resenting the ""touchy-touchy"" of her family, who don't value the distance and aloofness she does as an American. The cultural gap between Heidi and the family that once was hers is wide and unbridgeable.The cultural misunderstandings between them lead to an irreparable split. Heidi's mother loses Hiep again, and her suffering and grief is unbearable to witness.In their desperation to please Heidi, to explain themselves and their cultural norms, they attempt to communicate through a translator. Despite their poverty, they give Heidi gifts for her family. But Heidi can't see past her sense of insult, her regret at having made the trip to Vietnam, only to ruin her previously golden memories and dreams ""with all this bad stuff.""She is a difficult person to sympathize with. It would have taken so little for her to make a difference in their lives. A monthly stipend of a few dollars would have made the difference of where that family lived, whether her nieces and nephews could go to school. However, she clings to her dreams of the perfect adoption reunion which results in a happily-ever-after family, a ""sweet, gentle, soft-spoken Asian mom"" who loves her without asking anything in return. She can't wait to leave Vietnam -- the culture-shock overwhelms her. She arrives back in Tennessee, tells her adoptive grandmother ""you're who I know."" Her grandmother tells her ""I'm glad you went. I'm glad you got good pictures."" Meanwhile, we see Heidi's mother in Vietnam weeping, suffering because she's lost Hiep all over again.For me, it doesn't challenge the notion of adoption -- no, rather it challenges this American preoccupation with the dream of adoption reunions. When American adoptees seek to reunite with biological families overseas, this film is a stark reminder that those families will have cultural norms that oftentimes clash strongly with Americans' values. This film reminds us that biological families will have needs and expectations. When adoptees travel, not knowing, not understanding those needs, this film reminds us that the cultural gaps can lead to devastating results -- especially for the biological families. It left me wishing that Heidi had thought this through first. A little empathy and generosity would have gone a long, long way.",N/A

1071033,"Rome. Once the center of power for most of Europe, the coast of North Africa and portions of the Middle East for several centuries until its collapse in 476 C.E., continues to leave its mark on the modern world; but what of the people that lived there when Rome ceased being a Republic beginning in 48 B.C.E. to become, instead, the empire that ruled for over 5 centuries? Yes, we have studied their surviving writings, their surviving buildings & infrastructure, as well as their impact upon societies; but as individuals who lived their lives there from day to day, few have grasped what their lives may have been like.  Yes, there have been various films, such as ""Spartacus"" (1960) and various films that focused more on Christian themes within the Roman Empire; but these films typically portray Romans negatively rather than focusing on the Romans themselves and their lives in the capital.In 2005, a new television series aired on HBO with the simple name ""Rome"".  It's second season continued in 2007.  Unlike past negative portrayals of ancient Rome, this fictional series (based on factual events) focuses on the lives of various individuals, including Julius Caesar's former mistress Servilia (Lindsay Duncan); the power-hungry Atia (Polly Walker), who was related to Caesar; Atia's son Gaius Octavian (Max Pirkis as a teenager, Simon Woods as a young man); Octavian's friend & general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (Allen Leech), who falls in love with Octavian's sister Octavia (Kerry Condon); Mark Antony (James Purefoy), who is forced to marry Octavia to keep peace with Octavian; Servilia's son Marcus Junius Brutus (Tobias Menzies); Cleopatra (Lyndsey Marshal); Senator Marcus Tullius Cicero (David Bamber); and two Roman soldiers: Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson).  Lucius Veronus, still the tragic character wanted only to provide for his wife Niobe (Indira Varma), who died in the first season, and their children, who were enslaved.  Having served in the military under Mark Antony and briefly as a senator, he is given control over Rome's commercial district, but eventually rejoins the army after being rejected by his children (after rescuing them from slavery) and follows Mark Antony to Egypt.  Lucius Veronus often helps his less educated friend Titus Pullo, who has a huge temper and often uses physical aggression as a means to solve disputes.  Servilia, after being spurned by Julius Caesar in the first season and encouraged her son Brutus to murder him, must instead mourn Brutus' eventual death.  For, it was after Caesar's death, that Octavian is declared his son and heir, which he takes rather seriously to the chagrin of Mark Antony and Atia, his lover.  Atia (highly fictionalized in the series), still the egocentric and wanton manipulator, becomes very attached to Mark Antony; but that relationship is not to last, which may fulfill a curse from her bitter enemy Servilia.With frequent sexual intrigue and nudity, ""Rome"" is a series that will never be seen on network television; but it did find a very good home on HBO.  With its very interesting portrayal of life in ancient Rome from many perspectives, wonderful dialog, brilliant acting, beautiful cinematography and engaging characters, I rate ""Rome-The Complete Second Season"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",Rome:S2 (DVD)

656532,"You probably can't get a much better endorsement for a horror film than this--I found 1408 fairly scary.  Now that might not sound very remarkable, but I'm someone who almost _never_ finds films scary.  For me to get into that state over a film, it has to resonate with me in a way that few films can.Of course, I'm a sucker for horror in general, especially haunted house flicks--probably my favorite horror subgenre.  I'm a big fan of Stephen King (down to liking the majority of King-related films), a big Samuel L. Jackson fan, and I like John Cusack.  It was an excellent idea to have Cusack's character, Mike Enslin, be a jaded skeptic.  I could empathize with him, because I'm also a writer and a skeptic with an interest in horror-related topics and the supernatural.  I thought the unusual move of setting this in a major, working New York hotel was well thought-out.  I also love the atmosphere of the hotel--the interior decoration, the design of the sets, etc.All of the above primed me for the film, combined with some fine scriptwriting and performances--for example, the extended scene featuring Jackson's character, Gerald Olin, pleading with and trying every way to bribe Enslin into rethinking his decision to stay in Room 1408 was one of the better I've seen in some time.The scariest moments arrive fairly early--shortly after Enslin begins his stay in 1408, but the whole film is incredibly engrossing, even if it begins to turn into more of a ""rubber reality"" trip by the end--ala Jacob's Ladder (1990), Memento (2000), The I Inside (2003), and maybe not just coincidentally, the too-little-known Nightmare on the 13th Floor (1990) (different than the Thirteenth Floor from 1999, even though that's another rubber reality film) . . . and that's another favorite genre for me.  The ambiguities in 1408 are a lot of fun to speculate about afterwards, but they're also not aggravating, as some rubber reality films can be.",1408

In Saw III we get what is expected.  More games, more sick twisted scenes, and we also get a surprise at the end of the movie that for me was worth giving the film four stars.

1062885,"David E. Kelley created ""The Practice"" to be the flip side of ""L.A. Law,"" the show for which he wrote 67 episodes and won his first Emmys.  Bobby Donell and his partners are not a prestigious law firm in Hollywood, they are scrambling to stay solvent in Bean Town and do it defending clients who are so obviously guilty it is painful.  The series lasted eight episodes before it morphed into ""Boston Legal,"" and the keystone for the series was how both sides were always passionate about their positions, and somtimes too passionate.  Cold logic is rarely the key to courtroom success in this series, which is just as well because you have clients that run the spectrum from ""Free Willy,"" who likes to expose himself in public, to Gerald Braun, who murders his daughter's killer with the approval of his rabbi.  Not surprisingly, these cases take multiple episodes to resolve.Pay attention to the fact that this is ""The Practice: Volume One"" and not ""The Practice: Season One.""  The show was a replacement series that first aired on March 4, 1997, and the first season was just six episodes.  The second season was a whopping 28 episodes, so the first seven are included in this set of 4-discs.  That still leaves 21 episodes from the second season to make up ""Volume Two"" down the road.  This line of demarcation strikes me as strange because 20 episodes on five discs would seem to make more sense, but once we see the next volume the rationale should become clear.Watching these early episodes again it was interesting to see how Kelley takes advantage of what is a large cast for a ""small"" law firm.  Having a favorite is problematic because they might not have a case go to trial for a while (Eleanor always seems to be second chair early on).  But everybody pretty gets their chance to shine: Bobby defending Rachel Reynolds in the ""Pilot,"" Lindsey takes on the tobacco company defended by her law professor (""Part IV""), Eugene making a bet with a prosecutor on the case of Steven Frenault arrested for armed robbery (""Part V""), Jimmy with a little girl bit by a dog (""Dog Bite""), and Eleanor sued by George Vogleman (""Sex, Lies, and Monkeys"").This is a show where the judges matter, with Linda Hunt as Judge Zoey Hiller clearly standing out along with Ed Asner as Judge Matlin Pratt in ""The Blessing.""  One of the fun things is seeing familiar faces as judges, from Ron Glass to Armin Shimerman, but what the judges have to say about the lawyers (on both sides) is part of the equation.  Sometimes the clients take over the show, of which there is no better example than John Larroquette as Joey Heric in ""Betrayal,"" although I also remember John Carroll Lynch as Dr. Robert Larson in ""Search and Seizure,"" the final episode in this collection.  Obviously, those who caught all eight seasons watch these early ones knowing what is going to happen with Vogleman, Heric, and other memorable clients as well as with the lawyers who defend them.  Kelley made sure his shows were always watchable, but I have a slight preference for these early episodes when the cases were smaller and not always at the nexus of a whole bunch of issues.",The Practice - Volume One

74618,"I am happy to say that Jacob's Ladder was well received by fans of the horror movie genre.  It is a visually and emotionally painful film to watch and the overall impression it made on me in the theater is difficult to describe.  During the roller coaster ride of a very original plot my feelings ranged from terror to joy, hopefulness to hopelessness, a sense of rebellion then resignation, and ultimately surprise colored by bitter-sweet sadness.In my opinion it is one of the best horror movies ever made and when watching it you will experience many emotions.  This wide range of feelings is unusual for a horror movie to evoke and what places this movie in a class by itself.On a personal note, one evening while walking my son and daughter-in-law home on the West Side of Manhattan, they pointed out the lonely but lovely entrance to Jacob's apartment.  I thought my son was just making a joke and merely identified a similar looking apartment. No, there before me on the quiet and dark West Side of Manhattan was the on-site filming location selected by the makers of the film for Jacob to achieve rest from his long terrible torment and at last be reunited with his young son.This film pre-dates the current high standards for movie special effects and film magic visual imagery.  Notwithstanding, it provides many very original images and special effects which kept me riveted to my seat.It is interesting that CINEFANTASTIQUE indicated in an article on this film that the script could not find a backing studio for years and it was voted one of the best movie scripts to come along in years prior to being made into a movie. It was an absolutely amazing film.",N/A

1031584,"Back before David E. Kelley's skewed TV viewpoint became predictable, he did a wicked little number called ""Picket Fences.""Kelley first gained TV fame in the early 1990's by injecting his wry humor into Stephen Bochco's then-ailing lawyer show ""L.A. Law."" (Kelley penned the episode where wicked lawyer Rosalind Shays met her demise down a vacated elevator shaft.)After that, Kelley settled at CBS, where he created -- and wrote or co-wrote -- the first season of ""Picket Fences."" It took place in the fictional town of Rome, Wisconsin, meant to represent Everytown, U.S.A.At first glance, you had to give the show credit just for daring to be out of the ordinary. The pilot episode alone featured the town's musical production of ""Wizard of Oz,"" only to have the actor playing the Tin Man drop dead on-stage. (The town's newspaper can't resist running the headline, ""If I Only Had a Heart Attack."")As if that isn't enough, sheriff Jimmy Brock (the beautifully understated Tom Skerritt) has to contend with the town's first murder case. Mind you, no ordinary murder would do for this occasion; it consists of a housewife who was crammed into a running electric dishwasher.""Picket Fences"" never failed to exercise its flair for the bizarre. But upon second glance, the offbeat stories were merely attention-getters for some of TV's best fleshed-out characters. Among them were Jimmy's family (including Holly Marie Combs, later to star in The WB's ""Charmed""), headed by his doctor/wife Jill (Kathy Baker). And in Kelley's seeming take-off on ""Law and Order,"" the town's many legal cases were overseen by Judge Henry Bone (Ray Walston) and ambulance-chasing lawyer Douglas Wambaugh (deservedly Emmy-winning Fyvush Finkel).Rarely has a TV ensemble exploded on the scene with such gutsiness and flair. Among many first-season highlights, my favorite is the Thanksgiving episode, in which Jill must contend with the new fianc&eacute;e of her father (an Emmy-winning guest turn by Richard Kiley). The episode hinges on a scene where Jill's bitter argument with her father is counterpointed by Wambaugh's equally heated discussion with his wife. It's one of the most perfectly acted and edited pieces of television I've ever seen.Be aware that the show doesn't shy away from hot topics (though it never goes for cheap thrills or laughs, as so many ""relevant"" dramas and sitcoms do). But if you know that going in, then you'll be rewarded with some very riveting TV viewing.",N/A

1103828,"""Hm, nice package!"", I said while opening the box from Amazon with several DVDs inside. ""I am going to start with this one"".... But what I found inside was really nice package and really painful representation of what I was waiting for to have in a decent form.Right from the start on all the discs come the impressive menus/submenus with embedded bonus materials. ""Good start! Move on!"". Audio commentaries, ability to select the chronological order of tracks - excellent! (5-star review was already being composed in my mind)....But what came next strongly disappointed me. All of the videos in the main body of all three discs are cropped on top and bottom! Well, such butchering is a result of the contemporary marketing rules. The same things happened to the movies when they were cropped on the sides to be released on VHS videos to fit concumer's TV screens. Now we have the opposite situation: what WAS filmed in full-frame and was intended to be screened on 4:3 screens is cropped ""to fit our 16:9 TV sets"". Who cares about the product itself??!! Even letterboxed images are being cropped at a tighter matte, we all know about that, but the result looks very poor. The same thing happened to this promising (at first glance) set.FORTUNATELY, bonus materials are not cropped! So we have London Town, Band on the Run and some other stuff in excellent quality.After I ran through this set I got back to my old amateur dvd-s with the same videos but the picture untouched (well, call them bootlegs, if you like, but they aren't in fact: I got them from people who do not buy or sell stuff, only swap copies). Here when I calmed down. ""No"", - I said,  - ""I won't get rid of you. Here is the real stuff"".One more surprise: I haven't found the Southbank Show bonus on Disc 1, instead there is a piece where Paul is talking about creation of Eleanor Rigby/Eleanor's Dream sequence for Broad Street sessions. If this is a mistake - this is not a bad mistake and I don't complain about that. Or maybe this is my mistake and this IS the Southbank Show? Correct me if I'm wrong.Finally, this is definitely not a complete set of Paul McCartney videos.Resume: an unjustified waste of money? Well, if one doesn't have another source to get that stuff from - it's not a waste of money, but the consumer remains deprived anyway. Hence minus three stars for ripping people off.",N/A

It does keep you interested. When you find out certain things your reaciton is ""Oh you've got to be kidding"".  There are some very funny scenes, particularly towards the end.

948574,"This is the second movie from director Gael Morel I have watched recently. The first one being ""Full Speed."" I rated ""Full Speed"" poorly. By watching this second movie, I understand why. I feel this director is very unorthodox in his expression of gay issues, and by being not familiar with his style of directing, am missing the point of what is being presented.His stories are about a bunch of people, mostly men, in a particular point of their lives. There is no main gay theme. These people could be gay or straight. There is violence in one or two of the characters. He is very much appreciative of the human male form, as all of his actors are very athletic, good looking, perfect bodies (no nerds.) He also makes an emphasis on Arab men, particularly from Algeria, North Africa.This movie revolves around three brothers, Marc, Christophe, and Olivier (the youngest.) Their mother had died painfully and all the boys missed her terribly. Christophe is in jail. He comes out of jail toward the middle of the movie and joins the family (he is straight.) There is one more boy, Hicham, an Arab young boy who is gay and friend of Marc. This boy becomes romantically involved with Olivier. Olivier being the only gay som in the family (he loose his virginity to Hicham without any of the other brothers knowing.) I am not sure what Marc is.Marc gets into trouble with the local thugs (drug dealers) because he owes them money. He gets beaten by them and he is forced to throw his prize dog over a cliff to the town river. I almost turn the movie off as I am an animal lover (I don't think there was any cruelty to the animal, it is just part of the story.) Marc wants revenge and to kill the thug who hurt him and kill his dog. He wants his brother Christophe to help him but he refuses. He then becomes bitter towards his brother. Toward the end of the movie, Marc gets hurt seriously by attempting to run over his nemesis, he misses his target totally, hitting a tree in the process. His anger got the best of him.Christophe gets a job in town after his release from jail and he gets promoted right way, and he finds a girl who is going to marry him, and his life seems to be progressing nicely. Hicham dumps Olivier (I do not know why) after using him. Hicham is a dancer and teaches Oliver the art. Olivier becomes real good (competitive). Marc becomes paralyzed but makes a struggling recovery. The final scene shows Olivier going into a building with a hand gliding instructor. Hicham has taught him to hand glide.Even though I found this movie to be better than ""Full Speed"", the plot was again somewhat confusing. These are not your ordinary ""gay"" movies. The scene of the three brothers, in an interlocking position, sleeping naked, is very provocative and erotic, talking about brotherly love (the father was totally mesmerized watching.)The movie near the French Alps making the scenery rather beautiful.",Three Dancing Slaves
1061165,"This is the best movie ever about Hannibal Lecter, and people that like being scared to the very core of their being ought to not waste any more time but get right out to their local video seller/renter and grab a few copies of this up!Spoiler Alert:  Hannibal Rising is about this very angry man named Hannibal Lecter who has a passion for murder and an equal passion for eating.  But whereas most of us can relate so far...be forwarned that this gentleman likes eating PEOPLE!  Yikes.  I better watch my step reviewing this one or he may come after me!Note to Hannibal Lecter:  Please don't come after me.  I'm probably way too sour for your palate.Disclaimer:  I haven't seen all of the movies in the Hannibal Lecter series, but I can be sure that this one is the best!  It will totally creep you out in ways that the first one (Hannibal) did not.  I would still like to see the one with Jodie Foster in it too.I don't believe this movie is good for children under 7, but it does have an excellent message for all others which is that if you do the crime, you're gonna do the time.  Since the real-life Hannibal Lecter, according to news reports, is still out there on the loose, parents should probably take a few moments to sit with their younger kids and tell them to take a chill pill and relax--that Hannibal isn't into eating kids.  Of course maybe Hannibal Rising II will change all that.  I hope not!  Spooky.In summation, Hannibal Lecter should have his own show on the Food Network.

924389,"I could write one line to decribe this show. Hilarious. However I love this show so much that I'm gonna write more. I highly recommend watching season 1 before this, as many of the jokes carry over to this season (one of the many reasons I love this show).As I said you should watch season 1 before this, so I'm not gonna go into explanation about the shows storyline, instead outline some of the incredibly funny moments. There was an awful lot to choose from, but the funniest for me was Buster using Gob's puppet exclaiming to his mother ""I don't want to go to no country club you freak BITCH!"", or Maebe's job and catchphrase ""Marry me"" and then switching it up in a priceless moment ""BABYSIT ME!"". The season long gag of nobody remembering Ann, George Michaels girlfriend, was great as well.The cast is wonderful. Each character has so much depth its amazing. The show as a whole is near perfect because of everyone. I think if one was missing the show would lose impact because all the jokes bounce off of each character. I found myself loving Maebe's storyline, as well as her as an actor. Incredibly funny along with George Michael. Buster is my favorite though. He plays a potentially annoying character very well and hilariously.I cant give this as high a rating as season 1, because I felt that was better, but this one is no disappointment. The only critique I have is some storylines seemed to not wrap up. That may be due to the season being cut down a few episodes. Either way you'll laugh, a lot, in this wonderful season to a wonderful show.",Arrested Development: Season 2

650251,"There's plenty of plot summaries about, so I won't repeat those.  If you haven't seen the movie, and are expecting another bubbly POTC1, or romping POTC2 (which I also love) - well, all I can say is that a group of us saw this opening day, and I left the theater (as a huge POTC fan) in shock - the kind you get from a roller coaster, and go back for more (which I did for AWE).  I didn't expect the director to pull out all the stops the way he did, OR to pull out the rug from any number of amusingly outraged viewers who have sputtered in fury at the way things didn't turn out the way you thought they should.  It's refreshing.This film IS epic, bittersweet, funny, fine performances by a perfectly chosen cast, superb set and costume details, wonderful camera work, and one of the best-scored films I have ever seen (first movie soundtrack I ever bought).  Critics have complained re the length and the plot twists - for my part I admire the way the writers drew threads from the first Pirates and wove a rich, multi-faceted story, completing storylines opened in Pirates 2. (And oh, yeah, there isn't enough Jack, but there's never enough Jack, and Davy Jones' and Elizabeth/Will's story also needs to be told).  This is a movie to sink into, and re-watch many times - I hope for more POTC but I don't know how some of the scenes in this movie can be topped.  The director moves from sad/tense scenes to funny with a sure touch, much like the camera moves effectively from foreground shots to back, and from grand sweeping shots to close-ups - so the film never drags, with perfectly ""matching"" music.As far as the DVD set, I don't know technical details but I have no complaints about the sound/picture of the DVDs, except this is a movie that demands a big screen.  The bonus features are interesting and enjoyable and give some taste of the stupendous amount of work involved in creating AWE (as does watching the end credits).  Disney does a fine job with its DVD menus and menu graphics - only annoying thing is a Disney DVD commercial I can't find a way to menu out of, fortunately it's short.  The bloopers still make me laugh - biggest complaint is only 2 deleted scenes (and POTC fans KNOW there was more footage, it even shows up in the trailers) but I am hoping for an extended edition of AWE eventually).  Finally - this movie really is a completion of Dead Man's Chest - you really need to see Pirates 2 (and preferably Pirates 1 as well) to truly enjoy At World's End.",N/A
1092207,"I absolutely freakin' love this movie.  My best zombie-loving bud only gave it two stars, but it's five stars all the way from this reviewer.  It has pretty much everything I want in a zombie film: zombies running absolutely amuck (no wasting time staggering around waiting for a victim to come their way), plenty of blood and gore, great special effects, some well-timed hilarity, and an assortment of hot chicks.  Put a check by each line in the zombie flight summary of Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane (also known as Plane Dead).  And don't go chanting Snakes on a Plane rip-off at me because the concept of this film reportedly predated that of Snakes on a Plane and, more importantly, this is a much more entertaining movie.  Let's face it; if there's anything harder to deal with than snakes on a plane, it would have to be a quickly multiplying number of vicious zombies on a plane.  Even first-class ticket holders can forget all the niceties when carnivorous cadavers come to play.Those wacky scientists have been at it again, putting together some kind of malaria virus (which is particularly impressive given the fact that malaria is not caused by a virus at all) that, well, basically kills you in a couple of heartbeats and then brings you back to life.  It's just the thing for the military, guaranteeing that you can't keep a Marine down, not even a dead one - and it's also useful for infecting and killing the enemy, as well.  It seems that the government isn't too high on the idea, though, and that's why the project's two scientists and project manager leaving the country on board a 747 en route to Paris - along with the freeze dried wife of one scientist and an armed guard to watch over the precious cargo down in the hold.  Unfortunately, the flight plan takes the plane through a gargantuan thunder storm.  Things shift around, containment is breached, and the special cargo wakes up and goes all zombified.Obviously, Boeing hasn't built the cargo hold that can keep a flesh-craving zombie from breaking out, and it doesn't help that the scientists and the co-pilot go down there to look around.  Thanks to their fresh bodies, the virus spreads quickly, pretty much ruining the flight for all of the stereotypical characters.  Mile High Club activities are curtailed, to say the least, when zombies start bursting through the walls and floors.  Not even a praying nun is safe as the zombie rampage spreads like wildfire - I'm telling you, these zombies don't mess around, and everyone they kill quickly joins the murderous zombie minions.  For the viewer, bloody zombie hilarity quickly ensues, most of it courtesy of the film's least likely of heroes.There's blood aplenty, but the hardcore zombie fan might be disappointed by the lack of viscera amidst all of the feeding scenes - this isn't Dawn of the Dead, by any means.  Still, I have to say that the special effects were, for the most part, exceedingly well done - certainly far more impressive than you'll find in the lion's share of straight-to-DVD releases.  That being said, this movie won't provide many scares to anyone over the age of 12, despite the fact that the zombies scream a lot when they aren't gorging their bloody faces and bodies with fresh human meat, and the only suspense I felt involved my concern that the hottest babes would be killed off too soon for my liking -- but that doesn't stop Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plan from zooming up the charts of my favorite zombie films.  I for one was immensely entertained throughout, and there's one hilarious moment toward the end that I will remember fondly for the rest of my days.  It's a shame this movie was denied a theatrical release, as I think it would have certainly broken even at the box office.  If you ask me, this is easily the most entertaining zombie film since Shaun of the Dead.",Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane

I think it is the best and most deeply moving piece of the Trilogy.It is about the end game of the quintessential idealist, Michael Corleone.Whereas his father (Marlin Brando) was the honor bound pragmatist, his brother Sonny was the violent loose cannon, his brother Freco was the gutless whiner, Michael was moved by his ideals and what he considered was right.In Godfather 1, we see him throwing away his ideals for Family protection, and in Godfather 2, we see him turned to stone by his own actions.  This is stressed in the Birthday party scene at the end of Godfather 2.In Godfather 3, we see a sick and dying Godfather haunted by the once idealistic Michael Corleone he was.  The idealism is returning to him, and of neccesity there had to be recompence for the earlier sins he did.  Yet the Sins of the Father affected all of his attempted repentance.  He paid the ultimate price at the end by the death of his daughter being part of the neccesary attonement.

This film has some very graphic and intense scenes in it,certainly too much for most children and possibly a plot a little too sophistocated for most kids as well. Pan's Labyrinth follows our main character Ofilia who endulges in books of fairy tales and fantsy set against a historical background of civil war in Spain of 1944.Her expecting mother and her step father ""El Capitan"" as she refers to him and one of the servants Mercedes.Ofilia's mother is having a difficult pregnency and is driven out to the coutry to have her child in the presence and insistnce of her new husband.Ofilia discovers a Labyrinth on the property,and is later visited by a fairy that night who leads her through the Labyrinth where she meets Pan,or more commonly known as ""the faun"".There she learns(as told by Pan) that she is the living soul of a princess from a far away land that thrived long ago in an alternate universe.They have been waiting for her return since her leaving for earth and passing so long ago.There,Pan gives Ofilia three tasks to proove her returning and that she has not been corrupted, each task more dangerous and risky than the next. Her first is to retreive a special key, the next...an artifact guarded by a slumbering demon which she just barely escapes with her life from and the last is the sacrifice of an innocent,all to be done before the approaching full moon.Through all the twisits and turns of Pan's world intermingling with the struggles of reality,is Ofilia really the decendent of royality from a far away land,is Pan real or imaginary?If so...is what he is asking her to do for good or evil intentions?Ofilia's world clashes with the very real world of war and a very cruel and sadistic step father.Pan's Labryinth is a fairy tale as told in stories long ago from authors like ""The Brother's Grimm"". Three tasks, causes and consequences for being defiant, it all comes full circle. This is a fantastic film, excellent art and design,beautifully photograhed,told and directed to perfection by director Guliermo Del Torro.True this film is subtitled in Spanish, but it is done well. I struggle with subtitiles myself, but I could understand a good portion of this film even when I wasn't focussing on reading subtitiles so much.A dubbed version of this film would be horrifically insulting and really ""take away"" the magic of this film.So ""suck it up"" and deal with the Spanish subtitles.Good fantasy films are hard to come by, and there are really only an elite few out there that pass as good ones.Pan's Labyrinth however will go down as a classic in my opinion.Multiple nominations were given and awarded to this film,and for good reason and adding it to a DVD collection will only enrich it.",Pan's Labyrinth
136466,"In 1855, England was near the height of its power. Industrialization had transformed the country, its empire stretched across most of the world, and high-speed rail was an established fact of life. In the midst of this Victorian order, Edward Pierce conceived and executed perhaps the most daring robbery up to that point in time.  Specifically, he and his confederates set out to steal 25,000 pounds in gold bullion from a moving train protected by every form of security available in that age.This is something of a pet project for Michael Crichton.  First he wrote the novel,The Great Train Robbery, and then he wrote and directed this adaptation.  As one might expect, the movie largely stays true to the book except for some trimming to help keep the film from running too long.  The tone is fairly tongue-in-cheek and the plot moves along at a good pace.The cast is largely populated with unknowns, though there are two obvious exceptions.  Sean Connery takes center stage as Pierce and does an adequate, though highly understated, job of filling the role.  Donald Sutherland plays his primary aide, Agar, and gives the part with a suitable touch of goofiness without going overboard.  The no-names all do creditably jobs of filling their roles but none stand out.Those who love a good heist should enjoy The Great Train Robbery.  Some of the intricacy is lost in the translation to film, but it's still very solid.  One complaint is that there is a fair amount of 19th century slang and criminal jargon that can be tough to follow and is never explained or translated for 21st century viewers.  It also seemed to me that Crichton might not have been the best director for this movie.  It's very ""by the numbers"" and lacks any real verve.  When you look at the plot, I see no reason why this couldn't be every bit as enjoyable asThe Sting, but it's not even in the same league.  There isn't enough sense of fun, and more emphasis on the intricacy of the planning would have made the crime seem more impressive.This is not a bad movie, and worth giving a try if you enjoy heists.  Sean Connery doesn't give his most memorable performance, but his many fans should enjoy seeing him play the rogue.  As long as you watch this with measured expectations, it's a pleasant way to spend two hours.",N/A

The fascinating encounters between the townsfolk and the denizens of the Circus......-The distrubing fortune-telling session with Mrs. Cassin and Apollonius..-The hot 'n heavy seduction of town librarian Barbara Eden by Pan--or is it John Ericson, the idealistic newspaper guy?-Arthur O'Connell and his mirror image/conscience embodied in that creepy talking serpent...-Big old battle-ax Minerva Urecal turned to stone by Medusa, but ultimately saved and transformed....-The fish in a bowl which, when exposed to air, grows into the giantLoch-Ness Monster (brilliant work by Jim Danforth) during a gale-force wind storm at night, accompanied by the sound of berserk Bagpipes (!), until Dr Lao, in his nightgown, can produce a rainstorm (to shrink the monster back down to fish-form)in a most amusing and imaginative way.-The ""Shane-like"" ending, with its message of kindness and wisdom...as exhibited by the relationship between the little kid (who once stood by the old failed magician Merlin) and the wacky but inscrutable Dr Lao.And how about that opening title music----witty and charming combo ofWestern tune (strings and accordion) with classic Hollywood ""Chinese"" mode (recorders, xylophone, bells, gongs, etc); a brilliant coup, composed by Leigh Harline, whose songs for Disney's 1940 ""Pinocchio"" certainly qualified him as a creator of child-like fantasy stuff.My only reservation about the film (and it's a fairly serious one), is the ONE-DIMENSIONAL and caricature-like nature of the acting and directing, particularly where the bad guys (O'Connell and friends) are involved.  It's really too bad---George Pal was a great guy and marvelous craftsman without whom the fantasy/sci-fi film genre of the 50's and 60's would have been MUCH poorer....but he simply was NOT a director of actors. And thus, in my opinion, ""Dr Lao"" JUST misses its mark as a major classic, despite all of its assets.  The potential was all there---just waiting to EXPLODE into an unqualified cinematic masterpiece.Still, you should own this movie for the brilliant and unique qualities which it DOES contain. An unsung milestone of movie magic and imagination.LArry RApchak",N/A

As reviewing the film alone, I doubt that nobody will quibble with the fact that this  is a beautifully filmed piece of work that had an equally compelling soundtrack.I found the colour and the editing to be exquisite, in fact.I personally felt that the pacing of the film was the biggest problem. In fact, it dragged severely in my opinion. No matter how compelling a story or how good the actors, if the pace is slow then the filmsimply has no energy and suffers from jet lag. I personally admire the work of Edward Norton, but this film simply left me flat. That it received  nominations did not surprise me at all.That it won none did not surprise me either.","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"
786946,"Diane Lane is a wonderful actress. She has the ability to go through a range of emotions within a few seconds in the most natural way, conveying conflicted, confused feelings better than 10 pages of dialog. The movie itself was a very pleasant surprise. While it is a light romantic comedy, it avoids becoming just another paint-by-numbers film. Just when you think it's about to fall into the standard formula, it makes a quick left turn. It actually has a lot of truth in it. Anyone, male or female, who has been through a divorce and all that goes along with it emotionally can relate to it. Only a few, though, will find the courage (and proper encouragement) to not allow it to define the rest of their lives. The film tells us this basic truth: To have any chance of ever finding happiness in life, you must always be willing to risk it all, in spite of any doubts or pain you may yet have. If you are so stuck that you cannot take giant leaps of faith, even though you yet have fears, you might as well go shopping for your burial plot right now.",N/A

738583,"SOURCE: Live 1983 performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London.SOUND: Reasonably good stereo.  The singing of the soloists is generally well caught, the orchestra and chorus slightly less so.  Some dialogue fades occasionally, but that may be due to the performers as much as the sound pick-up.CAST: Gabriel von Eisenstein, a prosperous Viennese gentlemen with a roving eye - Hermann Prey (baritone); Rosalinde, his wife - Tiri Te Kanawa (soprano); Alfred, Rosalinde's would be lover - Dennis O'Neill (tenor); Adele, Rosalinde's maid - Hildegarde Heichele (soprano); Dr. Falke, Eisenstein's good friend but also the victim of one of his practical jokes - Benjamin Luxon (baritone); Frank, Governor of the City Prison - Michael Langdon (baritone); Prince Orlowsky, a jaded and bored visiting aristocrat - Doris Soffel (mezzo-soprano); Dr. Blind, Eisenstein's lawyer - Paul Crook (tenor); Ida, Adele's sister - Ingrid Baier (speaker); Frosch, a jailer - Josef Meinrad (speaker).CONDUCTOR: Placido Domingo with the Royal Opera House Orchestra and Chorus, Covent Garden.TEXT: The lyrics are sung in a German not heavily burdened with Viennese lilt.  Spoken dialogue veers wildly from one language to another.SETS AND COSTUMES: The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, is a very large theater with a big stage.  The settings are of necessity of large scale.  This makes Eisenstein's residence, which ought to be the well-appointed townhouse of a prosperous but nevertheless middle-class Viennese banker who keeps only a single servant, seem out of scale.  The ballroom set for the second act and the jail in the third are serviceable.  The costumes are generic, late 19th Century, but attractive and appropriate.STAGE DIRECTION: Overall, the stage blocking is quite traditional, even sensible, leading one to make wild speculations about the director having actually read the libretto before staging the piece, improbable as that seems.  The decision to sing in German and speak the dialogue in polyglot form is a questionable one, probably earning, I imagine, about equal quantities of praise and disdain.COMMENTARY: The roots of Johann Strauss II's ""Die Fledermaus"" stretch back to an 1851 German farce by Robert Benedix, ""Die Gef&auml;ngnis"" (""The Prison"").  In 1872, that admirable pair of hacks, Meilhac and Hal&eacute;vy, cobblers of libretti for both Offenbach and Bizet, converted the old German play into a French vaudeville called ""Le r&eacute;veillon"" (""The Revel"" or perhaps ""The Christmas Eve Party"").  In 1873-4, the French text was re-translated back into German for Strauss to set to music, but with all references to Christmas carefully expunged as a sop to respectable Viennese sensibilities.  Oddly enough, the one-time Christmas Eve tale that premiered not far away from Easter in 1874 has taken firm root in Austria and elsewhere as a New Year's Eve entertainment.If there exists a poor sound recording of ""Die Fledermaus,"" I have never encountered it.  Each major recording has its unique merits and its champions.  Choosing the best among them is simply an exercise in expressing personal taste.  ""Chacun,"" as we are wisely advised, ""&agrave; son got."" Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for all the DVD outings of ""Die Fledermaus"" (and especially not for two recent outright horrors from Salzburg and Glyndebourne, respectively.)  Let me now hasten to allay fears by assuring you that this DVD ""Fledermaus"" is a good one.  Many, including the Good Grey Gramophone Magazine, regard it as a very, very good one.The cast is a generally sound one, and everyone (but Heichele) seems to be having an infectiously good time, especially Domingo, conducting in the pit.  They are all right, but neither Te Kanawa nor Heichele would be my first choice for Rosalinde and Adele, respectively (nor, indeed, my twenty-first choice, if it came to that.)  Hermann Prey is a sprightly Eisenstein, although perhaps a bit too old and stolid-looking to make Eisenstein's shenanigans entirely convincing.  Eisenstein is a low-lying tenor part or a high-flying baritone role.  I prefer a character tenor as Eisenstein, especially in Act II where he will be the only tenor voice.  Dennis O'Neill sings pretty well as Alfred, here translated into as Alfredo.  Benjamin Luxon, oddly enough for an operatic baritone, is adequate singing but notably better in speaking the dialogue.  Doris Soffel, is a tall, splendidly epicene figure as Prince Orlowsky.  Soffel, a very fine and well-known mezzo-soprano, here sounds very soprano-ish.  Had I been given the choice, I'd have cast her as Adele and Heichele, if I had to use her at all, as Orlowsky.While the performance is enjoyable enough the first time through, there are problems that emerge on subsequent viewings.  The choice of having characters speak in different languages to one another--Te Kanawa in English to Dr. Falke but in German to Eisenstein and Adele, for instance--gets real tired real fast.  The part of Alfred was intended for a Viennese tenor--imagine the young Richard Tauber.  Strauss wrote appropriately Viennese music for him.  Performance tradition, however, has turned Alfred into a caricature of an Italian tenor, Alfredo, and interpolated all kinds of tags and snatches from Puccini and Verdi.  Here, they have gone one step further and made him speak in Italian--hardly the native tongue of a Dennis O'Neill, I fancy.  It's a wearisome conceit. (When they extend the idea to make Eisenstein emulate Wotan when he bids ""farewell"" to Rosalinde, it's really just too much!)  Even more wearisome is the ""gala"" in which outside performers offer a mixed bag of turns during Orlowsky's ball ... amusing once, tedious thereafter.Finally, there is the matter of Domingo's conducting.  The Good Grey Gramophone calls it ""stiff.""  Since the Royal Opera House Orchestra is manifestly not a Viennese band, I'll give Domingo a pass on that point.  On the other hand, he seems to me to be a little over-indulgent on making comedic points at cost to the essential snap and crackle of Strauss' champagne-soaked score.Compared to the overall enjoyability of the show, my negative comments count as relatively minor.  You can certainly do worse--much worse--than acquire this particular version of ""Die Fledermaus.""Four stars.",N/A

I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary on the making of MASH and how they had to go to great lengths to keep their vision of the movie intact and they succeeded handsomely IMO.One of my favorite scenes is when they raise the walls of the showers while Major Hot Lips Hoolihan was inside and she falls and her outburst afterwords is just priceless, also the scene before that where she makes out to Major Burns and it gets broadcast all over the camp, also a priceless scene.True, the film is based on the book of the same name, but about the Korean War and MASH the movie, is as much about Vietnam as it was about Korea as far as the war is concerned.

668036,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best Italian horror directors. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your gore cravings. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Lucio from my play list, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a competent director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography. Come on down, ""Aenigma""!And yes, I've used this introduction for nearly every Fulci review I've done.""Aenigma"" arrived near the end of Fulci's storied film career. Anyone who knows anything about Uncle Lucio knows what this means. Yep, that's right. He's clearly running out of steam. What we have with ""Aenigma"" is a ""Carrie"" knock off with little in the way of gory carnage or real scares. Unlike ""City of the Living Dead,"" ""The Beyond,"" or ""Zombie,"" this movie simply won't do much for the diehard gore fan. Here's the story. Kathy (Milijana Zirojevic) ranks near the bottom of the social scale at St. Mary's College in Boston. A constant litany of cruel jokes, smarmy wisecracks, and sneers from her classmates virtually assures us that she'll seek bloody revenge against her tormentors. Sure enough, that's exactly what happens after a particularly vicious prank leads to an accident that leaves Kathy in a coma at the hospital. How can Kathy seek vengeance when she's supine in a hospital bed with lots of wires running from her head to cheesy, beeping machines? That's a good question. An excellent question, in fact, even though it isn't one I'm especially interested in answering. Why should I? Fulci sure as heck didn't care about explaining this clunker to the audience.Anyway, it turns out that Kathy has somehow gained the ability to take over the mind of another girl, Eva Gordon (Lara Naszinsky), and send her into St. Mary's as a sort of Charles Bronson with [...]. Eva befriends all of the girls involved in Kathy's accident, as well as the beefy gym instructor Fred Vernon (Riccardo Acerbi), a man whose own guilt in the accident Fulci clearly establishes earlier. Eva acts sort of tarty, claiming that her goal at St. Mary's involves sucking face with as many boys as possible. She's also a troublemaker in other areas, drawing the wrath of the administration. What happens next? Blah, blah, blah. The girls start noticing weird things about Eva, little facts that don't match up with things she said earlier. Blah, blah, blah. Fred Vernon perishes in an extremely humorous manner. Blah, blah, blah. Who's that weird maid? I'll bet she's important to the plot! Blah, blah, blah. Look! Death by slugs! Blah, blah, blah. Look! Jared Martin paying the rent as Dr. Robert Anderson! Blah, blah, blah. Tom Cruise? What in the heck? Blah, blah, blah. If you haven't picked up on the sarcasm, I found ""Aenigma"" to be...well...pretty darn blah.It isn't difficult to see where Fulci went wrong with this movie. Pretty much everything fails on nearly every level. A lack of serious gore effects we've come to know and love from Uncle Lucio effectively kills the film. Sure, the slug scene works well, and a couple of lame decapitations certainly spices things up here and there, but it's all rather restrained and surprisingly banal. A dream sequence promises carnage but doesn't really deliver the goods. It's sad, really, that Fulci would go to all this trouble to make a horror movie and then fail to ratchet up the grue. You're known for buckets of blood, man, so c'mon and DELIVER! Other elements of the film fail as well, especially the eardrum bursting, bad 1980s pseudo pop songs popping up all over the place. Watching the movie is like being stuck in an elevator for ninety minutes. And what's up with the Slavic actors and actresses in this thing? I'm looking at the names of people involved in this mess and I'm not sure whether I'm reading a cast list or reading roll call for a class at Kosovo Community College. All right, enough with the wisecracking. In short, ""Aenigma"" is a waste of time and space.Image Entertainment released ""Aenigma"" on DVD over here in the states, and I have to say it's a very sad affair. Not as sad as the movie, mind you, but sad nonetheless considering ""Aenigma"" is a Fulci flick. The picture and audio quality aren't that good at all, I thought. Then there's the lack of extras on the disc. I'm the first person to say that I would NOT want to listen to a commentary track or sit through some long featurette explaining every aspect of this film's production, but Fulci fans do deserve something more than a bare bones presentation. Fulci completists will certainly want to pick up a copy of the disc. For casual viewers and uncommitted Lucio lovers, I would recommend going the rental route. ""Aenigma"" really isn't worth spending more than a couple of bucks at the local brick and mortar video store.",N/A
1051879,"Guess I'd better send Carly Simon's publisher a few bucks now.Obviously the 5-star rating is for my memory of the series, and my pleasure at seeing it finally come to DVD.It is difficult to imagine some moments from the series using any music except what was originally, and brilliantly, chosen. Someone mentioned ""Tiny Dancer"" from the defecting Russian episode -- perfect example, since the dialogue even referred to the song. And I'm having some trouble imagining a scene from another episode (in which Bailey realizes that Johnny has forgotten their date) with anything other than ""After the Love Has Gone"" in the background. Well, that wasn't a Season One episode anyway, but I do hope the other seasons reach DVD and hate to think such moments will be altered.The music, as some have noted, was almost as much a character in WKRP as any of the actors.

551123,"MORE LIKE ****1/2 STARSNOTES: This review is for the original ""thick-pak"" set.  There are some SEASON ONE spoilers in this review.As season 1 ended, the X-Files section had been shut down, and Mulder and Scully went their separate ways.  Mulder's confidante, Deep Throat, had been killed as Scully watched helplessly; and Mulder still had no concrete evidence pertaining to his sister's abduction.David Duchovny (Fox Mulder) and Gillian Anderson (Dana Scully) immediately begin acting with confidence and seriousness towards their characters.  This is very evident in episode 1 - ""Little Green Men"".Not much can be said in this review of season 2, as it is just as good as season 1, if not better.Season 1 was a springboard for season 2 which fleshes out the main characters, and delves deeper into their pasts to find out what makes them tick.  The main difference between 1 and 2 are the numerous episodes devoted to character development and not actual X-Files.New character Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is Mulder's new partner as Scully returns to performing medicine.  Taking Deep Throat's position is Mr. X (played by Steven Williams), and Assistant Director Skinner gets much more exposure in season 2 (a function of Gillian Anderson who was pregnant at the time).There are 2 two-part episodes:  ""Duane Berry"" and ""Ascension"", & ""Colony"" and ""End Game"".  These 4 episodes definitely have a short movie feel to them.Again, like in season 1, the guest stars in season two are bountiful and surprising:  Tony Todd ('Candyman'), Steve Railsback ('Lifeforce'), Leland Orser ('Se7en'), John Savage ('The Deer Hunter'), Tony Shalhoub (TV's 'Monk') and more.  All these big names give the series credibility which would attract many more top-notch hotshots in future seasons.Season 2 is a very good follow-up to season 1, and proves the series was not content to sit on its laurels, but delve deeper into the main characters and way-out X-Files subject matter.My favorite episodes from season one are:The Host - Maybe the most disturbing monster yet,Red Museum - Why are kids disappearing, and then reappearing with ""He/She Is One"" written on their backs?,Irresistible - Serial killer Donald Addie Pfaster (Nick Chinlund) is downright horrifying,Dd Kalm - You've NEVER seen Mulder and Scully like this,Soft Light - What a weird concept,Our Town - Chicken anyone?, andAnasazi - The last episode.Least favorites are:One Breath - Too slow,Fresh Bones - A rip-off of 'The Serpent and the Rainbow"", andThe Calusari - This one rips-off 'The Omen' and 'The Exorcist'.The audio is in dolby surround; and extras include a 15-minute documentary, show overviews by Carter, behind-the scenes clip, deleted scenes, special effects shots, 9 FX spots, 49 promotional TV spots, and an all-new DVD-ROM game ""Unholy Alliances"" which places you in the footsteps of a FBI agent.If you have season 1, don't stop there...and if you don't?

In the first half, the movie builds slowly, the siblings relatonship is portrayed realistically as they are shown bickering about just about everything but through it all show genuine care for each other. The tension starts to build when thy come upon the lair of the creature. Of course at this point they have no way of knowing this terrifying spectacle is not man-made. Inside they find bodies lining the walls, looking eerily laminated. Then they are discovered and a car chase begins as they are being followed by a faceless man driving a black pickup truckin in a sequence that plays out alot like the classic movie Duel. All this works terrifically with mounting tension and shock after shock. I genuinly felt and was afraid for the characters. At this point I was so excited to see how this thing worked itself out I couldnt stand it. i also couldnt stand what the movie descended into after that.Any horror movie that plays on the type of fears the first half of this movie does should know that not only is less more, but that oftentimes the unknown is more terrifying than anything a movie can produce. Especially if after all that buildup, the reveal turns out to be Bat-boy. After that great beginning, the movie disintegrates into schlock jump scare horror with no sense of fun and having answered the question of what the stranger is, the only thing that gave me a case of the willies was realizing it wasnt going to get any better. I did appreciate the ending, at least they had the cajones to end the movie in a way i wasn't expecting, if thy had just had the cajones to give a second half that could live up to the first.",Jeepers Creepers
1045311,"Currently seen on TV and in a series of DVD releases, Strawberry and her friends actually got their start in a series of specials in the 80s. Now, with this DVD, two of these are available for everyone to view --- ""The World of Strawberry Shortcake"" and ""Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City."" In the first, Strawberry and her friends face the Peculiar Purple Pie Man, who is out to steal the berries from Strawberry Land with the help of his berry birds. In the second, Pie Man is at it again. He and Strawberry are finalists in a baking contest, and he's determined to win, no matter what sorts of dirty tactics he has to resort to.This show feels very 80s, definitely, but suits its time. The characters are reasonably cute, the plot holds up well enough and there are some fairly decent songs included.This DVD contains decent story content, but is generally a straight, no-frills port. There are no close-captions, subtitles and no special features other than previews for other releases from the company that put this out (Allumination) and a bonus cartoon that may or may not interest you or your kids --- ""Snow White and the Magic Mirror.""If you have fond memories of this old 80s cartoon, then this is definitely worth a look. It's also probably worth a lot for those that are fans of the current version of the program and want to see the origins of the series. Just don't expect anything great when it comes to production values.",Strawberry Shortcake: The World of Strawberry Shortcake & Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City

175141,"Nowhere have I read that Robert Mitchum-The Signature Collection purports to contain his best films, although perhaps the title subtly insinuates that to be the case. Perhaps it should have been called A Robert Mitchum Portrait or The Many Faces of Robert Mitchum instead. I would actually prefer the latter because that's precisely what the films included in this box set show. There is film noir, there is some drama, there is light comedy and there is a hokey pseudo-western.I had never seen any of these films before I bought the box set. My purchase was based on my enjoyment of other Mitchum films, mostly of the film noir genre. After viewing these, I came away with a much better appreciation for Mitchum's talents. Though these are not all great films by any means, each offers at least something to enjoy. Here is my ranking from best to worst:1) Angel Face: I like noir and this is a great noir film. Robert Mitchum is easily lured in by a strange and spoiled rich girl (Jean Simmons) he meets when he is on an emergency call to her home. He already has an attractive and stable girlfriend but since he fancies himself a ladies man he's always looking for greener pastures. He should have gotten out while he was ahead. He suspects she is trouble but he let the wrong head do his thinking and pays for it. The end is gripping though I quite expected that was where the film was leading. Five stars!2)Home From The Hill: There is a lot going on in this film besides the obvious. This is small-town East Texas where a man has to be a man or he doesn't make it. Mitchum is the biggest land-owner and employer in the area, but has made lots of enemies because he can't stay away from other men's wives. At the beginning of the film, he is shot by a cuckolded husband, at the end he is shot by an outraged father who mistakenly believes that Mitchum has pupped his daughter. In the middle is the story of Mitchum's two sons, one illegitimate but self-reliant, the other a feckless mama's boy that Mitchum eventually turns into a man. The question is, will the boy be just like his father, or will he seek his own path? Its a very well-written and well-told story. When you are not spellbound by the storyline, look around and see how everyone, including the minor characters, interacts. It will give you a fairly authentic look at rural East Texas society at the time. Five stars!3)Yakuza: I found this to be an illuminating peek into the inscrutable customs of Japanese society. East meets West? Oh, yeah! Its a good story about a business deal gone bad and how the Japanese mafia, i.e.Yakuza, would likely deal with it. Great action and great acting. Mitchum is an old Japan hand from his post-WWII occupation days and has old contacts there who are obligated to him. So he is sent back by a friend in trouble with the Yakuza to try to rectify the problem. Can his old contacts help? The answer is spellbinding! Sidney Pollack has made a very interesting film. Five stars!4)Macao: A quasi-noir that supposedly takes place in the former Portuguese colony of Macao. I never did figure out why Mitchum was there, or why love interest Jane Russell was there either, but he gets into a lot of life-threatening situations because he is thought by the local crime boss to be a cop when actually its someone else. You get exotica, a little romance, some knife-throwing local toughs, and a fat, greasy, and corrupt colonial cop to liven up the action. Not a masterpiece but not at all unwatchable. Three stars.5)The Sundowners: This could be a Disney film, really. Mitchum stars as a restless Aussie who wanders the country with his family in a wagon and takes odd jobs when he must. His philosophy is easy come, easy go. His loving wife Deborah Kerr tries hard to get him to settle down to no avail. They hook up with another wanderer Peter Ustinov who provides a lot of comic relief. To me, some of the best parts of the film are the views of the Australian outback and life at a sheep station. The best action sequence is the harrowing escape from a raging bush fire. You see so many examples of Australia's unique fauna throughout you could be forgiven for thinking that somehow you are really watching a DVD of a Discovery Channel feature. And then there is the hokey Dimitri Tiomkin score that often makes the action seem silly as his scores usually do. Overall, the movie is light-hearted and enjoyable, but eminently forgettable. Three stars.6)The Good Guys and the Bad Guys: You have to be kidding! One of the stupidest movies I've seen, it would never even make it into release nowadays. Come to think of it, I don't remember it from when it was released. Mitchum probably felt embarassed by the outlandish storyline. Actually, he does have sort of a sheepish look about him. The best thing about the movie is the setting in the beautiful environs of Chama New Mexico. You have to see it in order to appreciate how lame it is. Probably went straight to the kiddie movies on Saturday morning TV. One star.Despite my comments about the last couple of films, overall I would recommend Robert Mitchum-The Signature Collection to any fan who wants to own a representative sampling of his work. I'll certainly be enjoying it more than once.",N/A

1048027,"Talk about beating the odds.  Twenty-one films and some forty-four years into cinema's longest-running franchise, the Bond filmmakers have managed to redefine the character with resounding success.  In fact, as of this writing, Casino Royale is the highest-grossing 007 adventure ever.I've seen them all, and I've always held onto the belief that Connery IS and ALWAYS WILL BE James Bond.  But Daniel Craig almost made me forget Connery completely!  Oh sure, the early Connery films are still great fun, and the sheer nostalgia of his era can't really be ignored.  But THIS is Ian Fleming's James Bond the way he was meant to be: Cold as ice, infused with lethal cunning and nerves of steel.The real fun (and the real payoff for longtime fans) is watching how the writers, and Craig, slowly ""create"" Bond for the audience.  [SPOILERS AHEAD] There's no Q branch, no Miss Moneypenny, almost no gadgets and precious few glib one-liners.  But all the things that fans would come to love about the character are subtely laid out in the course of nearly 2 1/2 hours.  And if that sounds like a long time, you obviously haven't seen the movie yet.  Second-time director Martin Campbell (of Goldeneye, in which Bond was recreated in the person of Pierce Brosnan) piles on the action from the outset.  The construction-scene chase alone packs in more mind-blowing action in 10 minutes most movies manage in two hours.  And the scene that could have, in lesser hands, brought the action to a grinding halt (the poker game) actually provides some of the film's greatest thrills.Two minor quibbles that probably won't matter to casual fans: Considering this is a 2-disc set with many extras, why is there no trailer for the film?  We get trailers for Spider-man 3, Rocky Balboa, The Pursuit of Happyness and others, but not Casino Royale?  And I wish MGM/Columbia would have maintained the same package design as the previous Bond films, just so this one won't look kinda odd on the shelf next to my 20 other 007 adventures.  But again, minor complaints.Even if you're not a James Bond fan, give this one a try.  It's easily the best action film of 2006.  And [looks around to make sure no one is listening]. . .Daniel Craig IS Bond!",N/A
1030427,"I'm not going to write a long review about this because other people on here have already explained why this is an instant classic. Anyone who thinks this was cliche or is upset because of dialogue translations really miss the point with this one.Not only are the fight scenes the best I've seen especially with minimal CGI additions but the story is certainly one not told in American theaters these days. The whole philosophy of ""work together as a team - one weak person acting on their own can hurt the community"" type of thing is certainly not the American way. With that being said, this story was portrayed beautifully and could really wake up some of us fat Americans that possibly our way of thinking does not make it right to impose on all other countries. I applaud this film for portraying the last two fighters with respect and honor. It could of been so easy to make the USA fighter as cheater, sore loser, etc. And BTW - this film isn't political at all it just shows how one mans vision can really change the way that people view life and how you keep learning new things up intil the end.Watch the unrated version vs the theatrical version - the plot almost depends on it! New & old fans should view this. A life lesson packed with spectacular fighting. What more could you ask for?",N/A
845491,"I have seen ""Anatomy of Hell"" and posted a review over a year ago but Amazon refuse to post it.........what did I say? Anyway brash, aggressive, meaningful, and yet ultimately absurd, ""Fat Girl"" is so intensely polarizing that it leaves no room for neutrality. Overweight Anas (Anas Reboux) is a heartbreakingly self-conscious 12-year-old girl who lives in the shadow of her blossoming older sister, Elena, who has fallen in love with Fernando (Libero De Rienzo), a smooth-talking lothario. When he sneaks into the girls' bedroom at night, Anas listens in painful detail to her sister's sexual initiation. In this scene and others, the film is so upfront and candid that it creates an uncomfortable viewing experience.""Fat Girl"" isn't a perfect movie.  Many people will find it too slow, too static, not enough ""happening"" to keep their attention.  But there is a lot going on--it's just under the skin, where most movies don't typically look.  One example of the movie's insight comes when that no-good Fernando gives Elena a ring as a token of his ""love"", except that how he obtained it and under what pretenses only comes out later to paint the whole thing with a double layer of irony.  Another moment comes when we see the sisters together, using words that are both hurtful and reassuring.  They are unquestionably in competition, but they are also still sisters, and perhaps they cannot help but care about each other.The end of ""Fat Girl"" contains a development so sudden and unexpected that it derails the film for many people.  They actually get angry about it.  They feel betrayed by the movie--betrayed that it spends so much time involving us emotionally in these characters, only to do something that seems entirely arbitrary.  I felt betrayed as well, until I realized something--the betrayal we feel, as viewers, is very much the same betrayal that the girls themselves feel for having been treated so badly by their parents, by a prospective lover, and by each other.  No, the ending will not work for every audience, but it has an audacity and a guiding sensibility, and it is nowhere nearly as arbitrary as you might want to think. Criterion! That one word alone should make this a must-have if you're interested in the film.",Fat Girl

183256,"Movies with an anti-war message are nothing new to Studio Ghibli, churning out such animated films as ""Nausicaa"" and ""Princess Mononoke.""  This widely acclaimed entry is no different, except that it's added to the long list of WWII-related media.  It focuses on Japan but not on the ""aggressors"" of the war.  On the contrary, it's all about the civilians.Losing their mother in an air raid, young Seita and his little sister Setsuko move in with an aunt who doesn't hide her resentment for the two.  Realizing they're not wanted, Seita and Setsuko leave to fend for themselves.  When the kids find refuge in a cave, all is well at first.  But as time passes and their food supply disappears, Seita and Setsuko find themselves in a struggle to stay a step ahead of starvation.  The viewer is then forced to watch the kids, alone and beyond help, as their ordeal goes on to the bitter end.While it seems that the kids get themselves in trouble by choosing pride over reason, that's far from the point of this film.  It not only lets the viewer see the war from the other side, but takes a look into the hardships endured by the Japanese in those days.  With food either being scarce, overpriced, or rationed everywhere (and with some areas being constantly attacked by enemy forces), getting by wasn't as easy as getting a job.  And a helping hand would only jeopardize another person's survival.  However, one must have a good eye to grasp the historical and moral significance of the film.  Though it becomes painful to watch, its reputation as a teargusher seems to be slightly exaggerated.In this two-disc set, the first disc features the subbed and dubbed versions of the movie, along with trailers of other works licensed by Central Park Media.

He goes to look for him and realizes the assassin is on the run from his former crime family.  The assassin has a girlfriend who is pregnant and he has to protect her and kill the people that are after him.  This is where Nicholas Tse is a big help to him.Wu Bei is amazing as the assassin, but Nicholas Tse really surprised me.  This is definitely the best performance I have seen from him.  I am not much of a fan of Tse, but he comes off as such a real person in this movie.  I was very impressed.A lot of people complain about the editing, but there is just a lot going on.  I found it easy to follow, and it gets better every time I watch it.  The ending is incredible.The action is very good.  Mainly guns, but there is also quite a bit of fighting.  The fighting is interesting because Xin Xin Xiong tries to make it as real as possible by making his wire tricks look real, and he outdoes himself.  I liked all the fights.

1064174,"This season is, sadly to say, the worst yet.  In a downhill pattern from season to season, Monk has gotten worse and worse.Reasons for believing this:  The character Monk is no longer funny or even that amusing.  Instead, the character gets more and more depressing.  I realize OCD is not ""funny"", but this show was meant to be somewhat comical.Another character who has been getting worse is lieutenant Disher(?).  He's become too moronic to be believable as a cop, let alone a lieutenant.  I realize cops aren't the brightest, but this is pushing the envelope.Thirdly, the fact that Monk (or anybody else on the show) has never found his wife's killer is getting old.  There's no reason to keep this going.  Make a two-episode show out of it.  Do whatever, but just end this.  Monk will still be Monk and maybe this would be a turn in the right direction (i.e. from depressing back to comical, with every now and then, a sad moment in the show).The show Psych seems to be taking Monk's place and the show Monk will soon be weeded out unless something changes in the writing.",Monk: Season Five
1064822,"Such is the strength of this production that even a non-Puccini lover like myself found it riveting from beginning to end. The credit goes mostly to Catherine Malfitano as Tosca and to Byrn Terfel as Scarpia, although the directing, the sets, and even the costumes contribute mightily to the success of the production.I love to hear Puccini arias performed in concert, but in his operas, I find the music in between to be rambling and unfocused; I also miss the ensemble pieces found in Mozart, the bel canto composers, and Verdi. I'm prepared to assume the fault is mine, but, nevertheless, it's how I react to Puccini. However, this production is so tightly crafted from beginning to end that I was caught up in both the drama and the music from the moment the curtain went up until the credits rolled.Yes, the Cavaradossi of Richard Margison is just average. His voice is strong, but he doesn't bring much characterization to the role. However, because Tosca and Scarpia are the heart of the opera, I don't think this shortcoming warrants subtracting a star from the five I've given it.Catherine Malfitano sings Tosca with that perfect combination of passion and control. She's also an exceptional actress - at turns vulnerable, jealous, fearless. You will be spellbound by her interpretation and execution of ""Vissi d'arte."" In performing it, she lays bare Tosca's life for us.Bryn Terfel has such a firm handle on the character, that it's hard to believe this is his first time playing Scarpia. It's not easy to sing so beautifully while projecting such terror as a character, but Terfel does. He is truly frightening, while at the same time mesmerizing us with his full-bodied bass baritone voice.The director, Nikolaus Lehnhoff has a vision of a decadent, fallen world and he carries it through in sets and costumes that are stark and rich at the same time.Whether ""Tosca"" is one of your favorite operas or if you're still learning to appreciate it, I recommend this production most highly.",Puccini - Tosca
360142,"I watched both versions of this film, first the relatively new one, with Nicholas Cage, and then, after seeing other reviews of that one, I decided I had to see this one before I could even think of writing a review. It's true, this one is better, richer in detail, far more authentic.Neither movie, however, is what I expected or hoped for; a statement about what is happening to missing children today, so I might cite the promoters for false advertising. Other than that, it is a serious look at the history of paganism and an eye-opening, thought-provoking journey through alternative belief systems in their historic context.What seems strange to us may be perfectly normal for someone else; and what makes perfect sense to us may be worth taking a second look at from someone else's perspective.Keep the River on Your Right - A Modern Cannibal Tale",Wicker Man VHS

The changes he makes affect not only his life but the lives of his close friends. The problem is - he never knows how exactly the changes made in the past would affect the present. The idea of the movie is anything but new - we all read Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder,"" an unforgettable short story about a time-traveler who steps on a prehistoric butterfly and causes the horrible changes in the fate of the whole humanity. We've seen the films Frequency, Groundhog Day, and Memento - Butterfly Effect borrows a lot from them. BE is not as good as they are but it is a compelling and intriguing movie about making choices and taking responsibilities. I recommend watching director's cut with the ending completely different from the theatrical release. The ending that I saw really made this movie for me.Very respectable even if not completely successful effort for Kutcher to do something different than Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), My Boss's Daughter (2003), and Just Married (2003).3.5/5 or 7/10",N/A
1064793,"In spite of the lack of hugh voices that have dominated Tristan in the past, the cast of the Barenboim Tristan reflects the lack of what we would think of as truly Wagnerian.  This is also true of Barenboim Ring, John Tomlinson excepted.  In fact, the reviewer in the Metropolitan Guide, Jon Alan Conrad, refers to this performance as ""Tristan Lite"".  Even so it is a document to the art of Johanna Meier an undervalued, under used and underrated artist.  Ideally the heaviest Wagnerial role she should sung would have been Elsa, Elizabeth Sieglinde and Eva. Having said that she sings a very beautiful lyrica Isolde.  The production is magical and the Brangane and Tristan  are evenly matched in terms of vocal decibals with the leading lady.  Kollo makes a handsome Tristan and is clearly taxed, but not to the detriment of the performance.Critics at the time felt that the production would have served Hansel and Gretel, so yes, there is a magical element that is quite beautiful. The camera, however, is unkind to Meier, making her look older than she was.  The voice, however, is youthful, beautiful and appropriate given the parameters of this production.  Ponnelle's conceit about the third act--Isolde isn't really a presence but appears only in Tristan's imagination so that after the Liebestod Isolde disappears. This is Bayreuth so I suppose a director is expected to bring something different to the table.  Ultimately this is a minor point and one that is easily disregarded.  Given the competition (the Vickers/Nilsson Orange performance excepted) this is easily the best Tristan in the catalogue.  This may change when Opus Arte releases the Glyndebourne production with Stemme but for the nonce this is a performance that is essentially conservative, well sung and acted given the current state of Wagner singing today.",Wagner: Tristan und Isolde

539664,"It is first of all an action film in which the whole action goes wrong because the agent did not do what he was supposed to do, he did not kill his target and he got shot at and he lost his memory. The story is unluckily not entirely clear. He forgot his identity. Fine. He did not forget his physical training. Fine because that kind of training has been ingrained so deeply that it has become an instinct of sorts. But how did he remember he had a bank account in Zurich and the number of the bank account, and what's more why did not the CIA close the account since the operation  had failed and the agent was supposed to be dead? This leads to more questions, but that is not really important for the action, though we like it absolutely clean. The message however is not altered at all. The CIA is able to train agents that have become plain robots and that can only succeed blindly in their mission or die or kill themselves if the first two options do not go through. These killing robots are in the hands of bureaucrats who are mostly incompetent and these bureaucrats are in the hands of  politicians who are first and foremost rotten liars. The objective is simple: control the world with puppets who can be anything, democratic tyrants or tyrannical democrats, no matter which or their reverses, provided they serve well, otherwise they die and the human killing robots get into the picture. When this film came out the US were starting to get engaged in the war on terrorism. The picture of this CIA is pretty terroristic to me. We know now, several years later that it was not that competent in gathering information, though it did gather some, but we also know that the politicians who used the information they got were pretty liars and making the incomplete information they got say whatever they wanted it to say. Is that very democratic? At the end of the film, when the politician is engaged in some new lie to the Senate, we are just relieved because the killing robot agent, Jason Bourne, has finally gotten out of it and has been able to trace the girl he dragged into the adventure unaware of what he was really dragging her into. But the story cannot be finished because the CIA cannot let him live just like that out of the goodness of their heart, for one simple reason: they do not have a heart. In other words, the cold war is maybe finished, but the terroristic spying agencies, politically correctly named intelligence agencies, are still thriving and well. We have not yet reached the country of perfect transparency and total democracy. And we pretend to give lessons to the barbarians who are not part of our club!Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",N/A
988744,"Absolute Zero is a disappointing ripoff of The Day After Tomorrow. The characters are insufferable. The hero scientist spent the first 1/3 of the movie discovering the oncoming ice storm, the middle third trying to convince people it was coming, and the last 1/3 outrunning it.While trying to warn Miami of the pending big freeze, the scientist meets his long-lost love, who's married to someone else. Her husband conveniently gets knocked off. How better to provide the proverbial  ""happily ever-after"" ending? Neither the daughter nor the wife shed a tear for his death, but they do stop running long enough to say, ""Gee, I miss Dad"", to which the wife replies, ""Me too, honey."" This is followed up by some serious, heartfelt sniffles and a painful narrowing of the eyebrows.And the tension keeps on mounting...Every movie needs controversy...so, the writer tossed in a nasty tempered corporate executive who values money over human life.  No clich&eacute; there, right? For extra romance we're given two college students who exchange boring and obnoxiously unfunny quips with the other.Ho-Hum. Who needs sleeping pills?Maybe I missed something. Within moments after the killer storm put Miami into the deep freeze, a rescue helicopter appears in the building's skylight. It's come to save the scientist and his group. Two questions. Why didn't the skylight and the helicopter freeze like everything else outside? How did the helicopter know where to find them?

1053986,"Here is how season 6 should've been: Clark/Lana relationship/tension/drama is over...for good. Clark is in college and an intern/temp at Daily Planet along with Chloe. There he meets Lois Laine (instead of season 4) who is also in college and on the way to becoming a reporter, instead of a goal free ex army brat who lives off of the Kents. Lana is still on the show but she is a sub character, maybe her relationship with Lex wasn't a bad idea  if the goal was to put an end to her relationship with Clark but the writers screwed it up by bringing Clana back. The friendly rivalry between Clark and Lois wasn't a bad idea either, they need time to fall in love and Clark needs to start working towards his main goal instead of jumping all over the place.Here is a brief description of how the 6 seasons really were: Clark pining for Lana, Lana pining for Clark, and in between Clark discovers new powers, where he is from, finishes highschool and more pining for Lana and some more of that. I don't know why the writters insist on keeping the Clark/Lana relationship alive after 6 years which should have ended in season 3. That is when it was almost agonizing to watch them together. In every episode they find ways to not to be together, and when they finally get together they screw it up. Enough is enough! It might be too early for Clark to fall in love with Lois Laine at this point, but it doesn't mean that the Clana relationship has to continue being shoved down our throats with complete disregard for the real story of Superman.I don't have anything against the actress but i completely despise Lana Lang. She is boring, 1 dimentional, docile, incapable of protecting and standing up for herself, even after Lex taught her how to fight seasons ago. She continues playing a victim and begs Clark to trust her over and over again. In season 6 she finally showed potential to have a back bone by going from a victimized charity case to a calculating, self serving, black mailing bad girl, then she went back to playing a victim again. I can't think of a reason why Clark is still in love with her, they have absolutely no chemistry, it is obvious they do it because the script says so. It's understandable that she was his childhood/highschool love, but he is way out of highschool and he is already 20. Time to move on with the real story.It is understandable that Lana was his childhood/highschool love but he's been out of highschool for a while now and he is already 20. Time to move on with the real story.I agree with another viewer that Smallville is all played out and the show needs to take on a new form in Metropolis. Perhaps they need to start a whole new show from scratch without dragging a pointless neverending romance for years and creating filler freak of the week episodes. Hopefully season 7 makes up for what was lost in the last few seasons.",Smallville: Season 6

208445,"I saw this flick on HBO when I was in high school many, many years ago.  Jack Nicholson directs as well as stars in this vehicle. I purchased this film because I vaguely recalled a humorous scene where Nicholson voraciously downs half a chicken and then leeringly implores Mary Steenbergen for some dessert. Unfortunately, I didn't recall the rest of the movie in which  Nicholson overacts a great deal and seems to be presenting himself as Charles Manson with a sense of humor.  My mistake for buying this hamfest.  Don't get me wrong; I love Jack Nicholson; I've been a fan of his for years; but, like many actors, he needs a strong director to rein him in to prevent him from doing what he does in this movie, which is overplaying and hamming it up and mugging for the camera.  The movie is actually boring and even tedious at times.  There are glimpses of the Nicholson sly sense of humor, but overall I should have spent my money on something more gratifying, like a tuna fish sandwich.Needless to say, I was disappointed with this movie.  Oh, well; you can't win 'em all.  And, I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most avid Nicholson fan who wants to own all of Jack's films that are out on DVD.  Aside from historical worth and a chance to see a younger, preening, leering, full of himself, salacious, hooting and hollering Jack, I would keep my money if I were you.  Sorry, Jack.  You're great; but you over did it in this one.For the record, Mary Steenbergen is quite good in her usual underplaying, subtle, and quietly sensuous way.  I love her face and never tire of seeing it on screen.  There's something about her that you can't help but adore.  John Belushi is also good in a small part as one of the employed thugs of the law.  Christopher Lloyd is good too as a lawman in a part that precedes his ""Doc Brown"" days from ""Back To The Future.""  The sets are realistic and the terrain is wild and rustic.  The movie is also put together fairly well.  But, like I stated previously, there is just too much Jack; Jack all over the place.  The movie might have turned out better had his character been hanged in the beginning of the film instead of being rescued by an opportunistic Miss Steenbergen.",N/A

1078922,"""Fracture"" (2007) is directed by Gregory Hoblit who has also made ""Frequency"" (2000), ""Fallen"" (1998) both of which I like and ""Primal Fear"" (1996) - his feature debut that I love.Crime /Thriller/Mystery /Court Drama are among my favorite genres and as long as the combination of these genres is clever, gripping, atmospheric, well acted, keeps me guessing and entertains me, I am happy. I know that many viewers were very insightful and figured out the twists and the ending within first half of hour or so but I did not and I was impressed by the way the disappearance of the crucial evidence had been handled - very clever. Besides being an entertaining crime movie, the most interesting element of ""Fracture"" is a struggle of wills and intellects between two main characters, self-made inventor - millionaire Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who shot his unfaithful wife in the face and put her in a coma and young, successful and smart assistant D.A. Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who has a 97% conviction rate and is assigned to prosecute Crawford just when he is ready to accept a lucrative offer from the prestigious LA law firm. The game of cat and mouse that highly intelligent and malevolent Crawford plays with Beachum makes the film interesting and the scenes between Hopkins (in his ""playful Dr. Lector"" mode) and Gosling (whose character does change as he realizes what he is dealing with from the unsympathetic self-centered hot shot to the man who becomes obsessed by the case, vows to put the murderer behind the bars and makes it his priority) - riveting and joy to watch. I also would like to mention David Strathairn as Willy's boss, DA Joe Lobuto in yet another understated effective performance. Strathairn's Lobuto is so interesting that he could be a main character in another move. ""Fracture"" is not perfect. For example, Willy's affair with Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), a beautiful lawyer and his perspective boss was lifeless - they did not have any chemistry together. I think that Nikki's purpose in the movie was to introduce Willy to her father, a judge, whose help he would desperately need in one of the later scenes. I'd rather prefer more scenes between Willy and Crawford but even the way it was, the movie kept my attention all the way through and despite the rather weak ending, I found ""Fracture"" quite good.3.5/5",N/A

But from the first vignette (of five) about two stringy-haired, lonely women, I was gripped.In that first part, a young woman's body has been found. The first four parts tell of its effect on various people. The last and weakest vignette tells of how the young woman got dead. The journey in each of the first four follows an unpredicable course. Each maintains a funereal tone. And they are chock-full of incredible actors who can match Rose Byrne in quality if not in loveliness.Too bad the writer didn't manage to maintain that tone or unpredictability thru the last chapter.

677200,"Most of you know Bob Clark's famous movie ""A Christmas Story,"" which was released Christmas 1984, but ten years earlier, Mr. Clark tried his hand at a different type of ""Christmas"" storytelling, and it doesn't require a prococious narrator to get the message across. Forget the silly remake that was released on Christmas Day a couple of years ago, this 1974 shocker is the one to watch. First of all, it doesn't rely on gore and blood to fill in for the lack of script. Partly the reason why remakes usually are inferior (Planet of the Apes, Psycho, Willy Wonka, Halloween), is there determination to make an already great film better, which is nearly impossible. None of the above mentioned films needed to be improved upon, and Black Christmas can be added to that list.Black Christmas predates John Carpenter's Halloween by four years, but it provides every thrill of that film, plus its characters are witty and more intelligent. Clark makes good use of POV (point of view) shooting to allow viewers to survey the mayhen through the stalker's eyes. The fact that there are so many things unclear about the character makes us watch and listen more intently. The phone calls are truly creepy, and although Kidder handles the perverted caller flippantly, we are genuinely afraid for her and the other soriety girls. As a bonus, the film also includes Olivia Hussey (Romeo and Juliet, It). I always found her to be an underrated beauty. Watch the movie alone with the lights turned down--you will be frigthened, and perhaps a bit tentative to answer the next phone call at your house.",N/A

I am sorry to hear about Mercury being let go, because matches like these prove why tag team wrestling is the best form of wrestling ever!

The crowd was actually solidly behind Kennedy in this one, and Batista just pretty much got owned by Kennedy and his submission skills. Near the end Batista does a Hulk Hogan version of ""Hulking Up"" and gets the win for the cheap ending. 7/10WWE ChampionshipLast Man Standing MatchJohn Cena [Champion] vs. Umaga:Sigh, once again Cena remains champ. This match was actually pretty intense, a lot of weapon use such as chairs, steel steps, even the ring ropes as they were broken in the middle of the match! One sick spot saw Cena throw the steel steps out of the ring right into Umaga's face! Umaga then had Cena on the announce table and tried to do a running splash but Cena moved and Umaga put himself through the table. In the end Cena uses the ring ropes to literally strangle Umaga and got the win. 8.5/10Royal Rumble Match:Very good royal rumble for the 20th annual royal rumble. A lot of top names such as Undertaker, HBK, Chris Benoit, Rob Van Dam, and others were used. Some highlights include Kane chokeslamming Sabu out of the ring right through a table in a great spot!

297041,"This film marks the debut of what was to become one of filmmaking's greatest directors, Andrei Tarkovsky.  While he had already directed ""The Steamroller & the Violin"" as part of his graduation from film studies, this was his first foray into a full-length film.What other reviewers do not note about this film is the interesting angle it presents on the theme of war. The movie's namesake, Ivan (a name selected to generically mean any Russian boy), is not simply an innocent who suffers the horrors of war, but is an aggressive, generally confident and committed scout, dedicated to eradicting the German presence in his beloved Russia.  After some idyllic opening shots, we see the 12-year-old Ivan ordering around the military man he is put in the care of. The scene is distinctively striking, as is the subsequent narrative arc that traces Ivan's involvement as a scout along the front.  If you are familiar with another excellent Russian war film centered around a young man, ""Come and See"" (by Elem Klimov), then you will certainly recognize some of the roots of that movie in this one.In general, this is one of the most narrative-driven of Tarkovsky's movies. Later in his career, he seems to have raised the technique of making content match style to the highest pitch; here, the story is clearly dominating how he films his scenes, sometimes experimentally rotating the camera, utilizing defamiliarizing angles, and running alongside actors during tracking shots.  One very notable difference from his later films is the speed of many shots. Here, Tarkovsky tends to opt either for a still camera in static scenes, or to quickly moving shots. There is very little of the excruciatingly slow ballet or creep-pans that mark his later work. This is not a merit or defect of ""Ivan's Chilldhood,"" necessarily, but one can certainly sense a younger director exploring the possibilities of technique in this film in a way that his other films do not reflect.It is interesting to note what one reviewer points out below, that Tarkovsky was not the original director for this film.  It would be interesting to know if any footage from the original director is retained in the finished version. Visually, one might make a case for this considering how starkly different the filming is between Ivan's pre-War and during-War childhood are. The colors, the lighting, even to the point of looking colorized and somewhat artificial, make a very vivid contrast with the plain, stark black and white of the military encampment's interiors, or the gorgeous austerity of the birch trees. All the same, the contrast could still simply be Tarkovsky pointing out the differences of pre-War, and post-War childhood.Throughout, there are numerous striking shots (the falling bucket, reverse shots filmed in water, the filming in the birch trees, a severe up angle on Ivan as he walks, and especially the particularly compelling final crane shot, where Ivan overtakes his sister and runs along the edge of the ocean), the acting is excellent, and the story is striking enough that it still deserves to be heard.This is not Tarkovsky's ""Mirror"" or ""Stalker"" (both of which I cannot recommend enough), but neither should it be.  Serious film viewers should certainly be familiar with all of Tarkovsky's work, and it would no doubt be interesting to start here, with his first film.  Definitely worth viewing.",N/A

504354,"I found this to be a fairly involving, fairly well done adaptation of Agatha Christie's often-filmed novel, but like 1965's ""Ten Little Indians"", this version also suffers from needless humor and a softening of the original story's bleak conclusion.  At least the humor here works a little better than the '65 version.I'm told that this version, as well as the '65 version, heavily rely on the stage adaptation of the Christie novel, the origin of the more upbeat conclusion.  Apparently, the thinking was that- unlike the book- one or two characters had to remain alive at the end to explain things to the audience.  I don't know... I think I could figure out several ways to dramatize the original novel without softening the proceedings.  But maybe I'm just a morbid person and grumble at happy endings.Storywise, this '45 film and the '65 film not only rely on the same ending, but- for the most part- they feature the same exact story beats, making one wonder why the '65 version was even made. It certainly didn't attempt anything new (besides casting hip actors and employing an out-of-place ""mod"" jazz score).  Though, admittedly, Shirley Eaton was more fetching than any of the actresses on display here.Anyway, enough with my meandering thoughts about this or that adaptation.  With its nice sets, solid direction, and bevy of old English acting pros, this particular movie is certainly worth a look, and so is the '65 version (though marginally less so).  But by all means don't let these films take the place of the original work, which remains a great old tale, masterful in the way it successfully combines the usually opposing forces of bleakness and strong entertainment value.",N/A

I have to admit that I have not seen any Batman's movies; so it made sense to explore the beginning of the legend, to find out how the billionaire Bruce Wayne ended up as a masked crusader who fought restlessly against the sinister forces that prey on the innocent and threaten to destroy Gotham City.Never been able to forget the murder of his parents before his eyes for which he felt guilty and responsible, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)  traveled the world fighting injustice with small-time criminals until one day mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) finds him and offers him the training with a mysterious and powerful League of Shadows, the organization presided over by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).

653467,"I have to say that Micheal Bay was very fortunate that this is a new generation. And the fact that a lot of younger people are not familiar with the original franchise people were willing to compromise. It is always people that don't have the knowledge of a franchise are the ones that have the ability to make it happen. Because I truly believe anyone that was a true fan of the franchise would have kept the designs as true to character as possible. The only person remotely that looked like themselves was Optimus Prime. Starscream was really poorly designed and Megatron. In the extra footage ""they stated that they changed the design of megatron because they didn't want people carrying him around ? Megatron should have been a cannon on a tripod and it should have resembled the character more than that. That was the beauty of the series the cool distinct designs of the robots. Sure you have to update but at least try to update to make them look similar. I mean we do not have robots walking around the planet now. So anything would have been futuristic in this day in age. Sound wave was an amazing character he was reduced to a parasite (Frenzy). I really couldn't tell what Megatron was when he transformed to either form he just looked like a big mass of metal. There were no color definition in any of the Decepticon's  or anything. Bumblebee and Prime I can say were the only justice that was done. Shea was ok in the film but it should have been more about the robots than him. Over all the CGI was done right it looked very real. And the movie had energy but I just hated the poor designs and poor character development. Soundwave, Megatron and Starcream were amazingly designed characters even in the 80's. And are main driving forces in the cartoon and deserved better justice ! I hope that if Micheal Bay isn't in charge of Part 2 these things are addressed. In the original cartoon they all mutated as the generations changed so they still can make it happen the right way, hopefully they will. The only reason I am willing to except this because at least an effort was made. And I have waited on this 20 years. I am really hoping the Voltron movie stays true to form. Because sometimes updating doesn't necessarily mean better ! Modify is a more viable this day in age especially when your talking about a cult classic !",Transformers

1065332,"Palm Pictures has put some pretty interesting foreign movies such as Akarui Mirai (Bright Future) with Asano Tadanobu, but Hanai Sachiko No Karei na Shogai is one of the most brash, funny, and downright sexiest films I've ever seen, hence the X-rating, so be warned.Call girl Sachiko Hanai is shot in the forehead by a North Korean agent.  She survives, but the lodged bullet penetrates the center of her brain (via some mind-blowing but crude animation) and turns her into an intellectual genius.  We can tell because she starts scribbling physics equations on the wall with a piece of chalk, and she becomes fascinated with French philosophy, and the genius of humankind--""all  that is man's passion released towards the Universe.""  However, one amusing side effect is the havoc it plays on her taste buds.  And the bullet hole makes for a grisly parody of the red bindi Indian women have on their forehead, although in Sachiko's case, it signifies the major nerve point in the human body--see what the bullet did to her?Sachiko runs into the bookish Professor Toshio Saeki, and so touched is he with her intelligence he doesn't think twice of having an affair with her.  He is one of the funniest characters.  I mean, someone who gets turned on by anyone saying ""Noam Chomsky?""  Sachiko then tutors his shy and antisocial son Mamoru.  Did I say shy and antisocial?  With Sachiko, not for long, and what better reward to get right answers than by her removing a piece of clothing.  What was it Van Halen sang, ""Got it bad, so bad, I'm hot for teacher""?Mamoru is keen on military defense maneuvers and missiles.  ""We'll always have wars.  It's a good occupation,"" he says. This leads to Sachiko learning how  ""the TDF missile system is manipulated by the Bush administration, neoconservatism and the military industry that supports it.""  And speaking of Dubya, he gets a great drubbing here for the war in Iraq.  He appears via some crude animation but by someone wearing a mask of freeze frame pictures of him.  Turns out that Sachiko accidentally took Dubya's cloned finger that the North Korean agent's after.  However, the scene of the finger violating her on the rooftop is queasy, not because it involves a writhing Sachiko being aroused, but because it's horrible to have Dubya to that to anyone, especially a sweet cute intellectual call girl like Sachiko.The mission accomplished"" speech is horribly but funnily dubbed, with references to his superweapon that pinpoints America's enemies one by one.  ""My intention is to have ""naturally friendly wars"" he says.  Naturally friendly wars....RIGGHHHHTTT!As for the North Korean agent, he's not exactly a nice guy, shooting people and even violating the professor's wife--a kind of nasty scene right there.  But he ends up having a conscience later on.  Hey, if it happened to Darth Vader in Jedi....The film is clearly a throwback to the late 60's/early 70's softcore underground flicks such as Doris Wishman's Double Agent 73 or Pete Walker's The Tale of Tiffany Jones, but since when did Chesty Morgan or Tiffany go full-frontal or have something white squirted on them?--and I don't mean mayonnaise!  Check out the dayglo pink cover of the DVD, not to mention Sachiko's outfit.  Typical go-go girl/exploitation.  And Sachiko being exploited by whoever she meets is straight from Candy by Terry Southern, although she does tend to give of herself to begin with.  Then you have apocalyptic elements of Dr. Strangelove and elements of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911.Emi Kuroda as Sachiko is clearly the star and a likeable one too, with or without clothes.  Her teacher outfit at the beginning is a knockout.  And her rendition of the Star Spangled Banner is definitely more appealing than Borat's.  Sheer, unabashed, sexy delight for liberals, aficionados of 70's softcore cinema, and anyone who loves contemporary Japanese cinema.

What I did like was the storyline, and how an innocent individual gets caught up with something she didn't know about herself, her family and most of all a very bad dude who is trying to be on her side.  At one point she doesn't know who to trust!  It's not the best installment of this series, but, on the other hand, the storyline is different and there is a new battle raging between good and evil.

It actually had a decent story but there was just something that it lacked in terms of trying to be the final Rocky.Certain parts in the film actually are pretty good but they just don't go together very well. While none of the sequels equal the original Rocky (with the exception of Rocky Balboa), all of them seem to have a flow to them that this one kind of lacked. In fact, when I view this film, I rarely look at the whole thing. Most of the time, I forward it to the end with the streetfight which is probably the best part in the whole film! If you notice, the new Rocky barely mentions Rocky V except for the phrase ""Home Team"" when he was talking to his son! That's how lowly regarded this film is.I can only recommend this film to die-hard Rocky fans or to those that want the whole story.

He doesn't know where it came from, only that it is new and not yet illegal.  But the drug was originally destroyed by the Church for a reason as the idiot's roommate finds out by accident.  The drug causes some users to thirst for blood and become animalistic.  It was the origin of the vampire myths.  Now a Berkeley student rediscovered it and lost control of it.Once the danger is known, the roommate tries to tell the idiot but he refuses to listen.  Eventually the party occurs and the drug is passed out.  It then becomes a battle of survival for those who did not take the drug.  On the one hand, the people trying to kill them will stop once the drug wears off.  On the other hand, killing them first seems the best defense.  Can they be trapped or tied up?  Is there any escape?  Watch and find out.This one was better than I expected.  I read a lot of bad reviews after I saw an intriguing trailer.  Now I am glad I decided to check it out.

The acting is what you would expect for the quality.

I'm not going to go down each track individually here, as that's been done better elsewhere in other reviews.  This is a DVD review, so I'm trying to stick to that stuff here.  A few indidivual song remarks, though:  Ronnie's wail at the start of the track ""The Mob Rules"" is quite impressive, given his age.  I have to admit to being surprised at hearing that.  Also, the track ""I"" was not one of my favorites, but live it's a heck of a lot better and more powerful than the studio recording.  The concert portion of the DVD runs one hour and fifty five minutes.Now, the Rhino press releases are making a big deal that this was filmed in ""high definition"". This is **NOT** a high def release; it is a standard def DVD release.  There is no high def release (in either format) forthcoming (so I'm told from Rhino).  Because it was filmed in high def, this does appear to look better than most standard concert DVD's, I think.There are four main menu selections on the DVD.  ""Play"", ""Track Selection"", ""Extras"", and ""Setup"".  The first two should be obvious what they are.The setup section gives you a choice between 2.0 stereo and 5.1 surround sound.The extras section on the DVD comprises four parts, each of which are briefly detailed below.""Radio City"" - Shows off the venue itself.  We're taken on a tour of the place by a Nicolette (Nicola?) Taylor, Production Stage Manager for RCMH.  She does praise the union there, which I'll take a moment to point out is the same union that kept ""Ear on the Wall"" from appearing on the CD/DVD due to union rules.  Runs 4 minutes, 6 seconds.""Meet the Mob"" - Interviews with fans outside the venue.  To be kind, it's what you would expect from a thing like this when you talk to random fans.  :)  Might be cool if you were there, though.  Runs 3 minutes, 14 seconds.""Hail the Gods of Metal"" - Background piece of the band, their legacy, the people in the band.  Interviews with the guys in the band, as well as some of the stage people, and a couple of the people from the ""Meet the Mob"" sequence.  Has some backstage footage of the band during warmups.  Runs 5 minutes, 24 seconds.""Heaven and Hell Road Movie"" - The tour documentary film.  The largest and the best of the ""extras"".  How the whole project came together, how the album came together (Dio Years), and how the tour came together, etc, etc, etc.  This also has a nice interview with the guy who designed the stage  set for the tour.  As this was recorded March 31st, there's some stuff here about the Canadian dates.  This is a very nice documentary of the events of this came together, and how the tour runs.  Has some candid footage of the band doing other interviews, and telling a few stories, including a moment that Tony calls a ""Sabbath Tap"" one.  Good stuff.  Runs 19 minutes, 14 seconds.The ""Road Movie"" also explains the origin of the ""angel"" that's been used on the band's artwork for awhile.  I won't tell you here, you'll have to go watch it. ;)Given the quality of the music on this disc, and cheap price, it's an almost ""must have purchase"" to me.  I personally could have done without the ""666"" motif in the logo and artwork though - seems a bit silly to me, but that's a minor quibble.  I saw them in Dallas on this tour, and it was quite powerful.  I'd seen them on the Dehumanizer tour 15 years ago, and it was impressive then.  It's still impressive now.

If you were expecting a true horror movie, you will certainly be disappointed.  I had a hard time seeing Judd's descent into the paranoid woman -- her involvement with Shannon is deep but to fall so hard into the maelstrom of Shannon's dementia isn't grounded.

Director Scott Derrickson does a great job of trying to keep our interest by giving both side of the arguement without trying to insult our inteligence with a ridiculous and predictable storyline.

I watched this film twice giving it my full attention.  I truly enjoyed the scenery and the overall artistic style was very nice.  I did watch it on a VHS tape so it was a bit grainy but that may have added to the charm.  The problem I have with this film is that it goes against my understanding/concept of Buddhism and Zen teachings.  The entire film was a depressing ordeal from beginning to end. I understand the intent and lessons of the film but I would rather see a Zen Master who treated his family with kindness and affection.  A boy lost in the woods and no one cares.  A group of people sitting around the fire in silence who do not recognize the existance of another human being. This is not a Master who I would respect or even enjoy being in his company.  A dying Master who smiled on his death bed and showed compassion is what I want to see.  Life and Death is a combination of emotions.  There should be SOME joy in both Living and Dying. Perhaps this Master needed more training... Then again maybe it will be better for him the next time around. If the intent of this movie is to show how unhappy people can be then it is a Winner.

Since Ricky doesn't take nothin from nobody, he is not liked by the tough guys and they decide to kill him.  Ricky's special move is punching through people's body.  Most of the movie is spent showing Ricky using this special move.  In one scene Ricky punches a guy in his throat and his hand goes through the mouth while he rips the jaw off.  That isn't even the highlight.  Ricky also has to chew razor blades and gets strangled by intestines.  There are no female characters except for 1.  We get brief glimpses of Ricky's girlfriend to show why he went to jail.  Yukari Oshima plays a man for some reason, but she is good in her role.The story is not memorable, but the gore has a lot of detail put into it.  There are not any martial arts fights, but the bloody fun makes for one heck of a viewing experience.  I could have used 1 really good fight.  Fan Siu Wong is truly on another level.  He is like a mix between Bruce Lee and Yuen Biao.  Awesoem fist forms, great kicks, and he is ripped out of of his mind.

655455,"Let's get one thing straight from the get go.  The Simpsons is one of the most beloved TV shows in the world.  Let's also get another thing straight, the show has been around for nearly twenty years and has actually caused a divide among fans.  Those who believe the show is still good (or sometimes better than ever) and still has legs; and those who believe the show has been declining in quality for years.  I warn you of two things before you read on.  The first: I am one of the Simpsons fans who believes the show has been declining for years.  I still sit down and watch the show, but in all honesty, the last good season was probably season 10.  The second: Because of my stance, this review is heavily biased.  I love the Simpsons.  I've sat down and watched it since the first episode aired.  But sometimes even fans have to realize when their favorite show churns out something that doesn't live up to the standards of fans.  Perhaps its because I've been with the show since the beginning that it's easier to find fault with the newer episodes.Despite that, this movie will please people from both sides of the specturm.  Whether you think the show is is better than ever or you think it has declined in quality as I have, there's something here for you and it's partly because every writer who has ever been a part of The Simpsons chipped on.The movie begins in Springfield where Green Day is giving a concert at Lake Springfield.  Unfortunately the lake is so polluted that the stage Green Day is singing on (it's floating on the lake) that it eats away at the stage and it sinks taking Green Day with them.  This forces Lisa Simpson to hold a town meeting where she presents her lecture entitled ""An Irritating  Truth,"" (obviously a parody of Al Gore's documentary).  In addition, Homer and Bart have some fun (a moment so hilarious you'll miss out on some of the dialog because you'll be laughing too hard) which eventually lands them in Krusty Burger where Krusty is doing a shoot for a commercial.  When its over he orders the Pig be killed... and Homer can't let that happen.  So instead he saves the pig's life and takes him home.The citizens of Springfield agree to stop dumping trash in the lake.  Of course, there is one man who will dump something in there, of course... Homer Simpson.  When Marge asks him just Homer has been doing with the pig's ""leavings"" he shows her a silo aptly marked: Pig Crap.  Of course, Marge is disgusted and says that Homer still has to do something about it.  So what does Homer do?  Dumps it in Lake Springfield which causes a series of events that soon reach Washington D.C. and a corrupt politician. In the end, Springfield gets encased in a giant glass dome.  When they wonder why, they eventually find out that Homer is to blame.  Through strange circumstances the family manages to escape Springfield and go to Alaska where they no longer have to worry about Sprigfield's state.  What they find out later, of course, is that the corrupt politician (voiced brilliantly by Albert Brooks) plans to destroy Springfield.  Its up to The Simpsons to save the day.The movie is complete with all the humor you'd expect from the show itself.  Parodies, clever and witty dialog (there are some keepers here), physical abuse of Homer, Bart's shenanigans, Lisa's unpopularity... even the over the top zaniness that some from my side of the spectrum have come to loathe.  And of course, the movie pokes fun on a political and religious scale.  The whole plot of the movie is based around environmentalism and corrupt politicians while they also do their share to make fun of religion.  The Simpsons has never been shy about tackling controversial issues and this movie is no different.  Take some things too seriously and you'll surely be offended.Still, it's actually a very funny movie.  Especially the first twenty minutes.  There wasn't a single person in the theater not laughing at what was happening.  This movie is fun of memorable moments.  The infamous Spider-Pig is but one ingenious example.And then there are some bits of the movie that just fall flat.  This would be the humor that has been coming out within the past couple of seasons.  There are some parts that so over the top in stupidity that you'll either love them or hate them.  Homer's character is also unbalanced.  Homer has always been an oaf but at some moments he is unreasonably stupid.  At others he's not nearly as dumb.  In other words, the mesh of Classic Simpsons vs. Newer Simpsons is all too obvious in many areas.There are some other nit-picky things.  Some stories just aren't complete.  Lisa, for example meets a boy who she falls head over heels with, but the movie never completes this story arc.  Another nit-picky fan gripe is that a lot of the film just isn't in Springfield to begin with.  This means that while you see many of the residents, you don't spend much time.  Most of the Springfield denizens we've come to love (Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, Chief Wiggum etc.) are on camera for mere seconds and hardly say or do anything.  It's almost like playing ""Where's Waldo"" only with The Simpsons cast.  It's not too big of a gripe, however.  With so many residents in Springfield you couldn't expect to see them all.  Just the same we don't really explore Springfield to begin with.  We don't go inside the school or the police station or anything.  Most of it is spent either at The Simpson's home or various places you've never seen in the show.But the biggest gripe?  That this is a Simpsons movie where Mr. Burns is not the main villain.  While watching this, I couldn't get over the fact that you only see Mr. Burns twice.  He's one of the most malicious characters in the show.  He's been involved in some of The Simpsons best lived moments, but here he doesn't even use his famous, ""Excellent"" phrase.  Not that the corrupt politician voiced by Brooks is bad, but it would've been far better had Mr. Burns been the main adversary.The final thing is that the movie is rather short and feels more like an extended episode rather than a full blown movie.  At 87 minutes it goes by in a flash.  And yet, despite which side you fall on: Classic vs. New, you yearn for the movie to be longer because regardless of anything, it's funny.  But it's also because you wish you could see more.It can't be easy to make a movie to a series that's been around for nearly two decades.  Especially with expectations so high.  The Simpsons Movie succeeded by having a successful run at the box office.  However, if you're from my side of the woods: Meaning you love the classic Simpsons episodes a lot... there's something to be desired that isn't there.For what it's worth it IS a good movie.  It's just a movie that had so much potential to be so much better.",N/A

It has its good episodes but in only half of all 4 seasons!! This is more like me pleading than me scorning. Come on, quit the 'I luv Lana,' 'I need Lana in my life' crap and get to some action, drama, thriller type Pre-Superman brawling. Even at the end of the sixth season he doesn't learn to fly. Why is it that the only time Clarke flies is when he is taken over by Jor-El, when he wears that retarded red ring or when he is cloned by that stupid phantom (season six)??? Enough with Lana. I wanted her to stay dead instead of Clark's dad. She's annoying and holding Clarke back from really moving on. Cloey's my choice.

650636,"Blood Diamond tells the story of the turmoil that erupted during the late 1990s in Africa surrounding the trafficking of illegal diamonds. The story is told from three different points of view. Djimon Honsou, as an African man whose family is torn apart because of the turmoil. He is forced to work in a diamond mine while his wife and children are spread across Africa by the corrupt rebels. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the jewel smuggler who figures why not make a quick buck even at the expense of the continent he grew up in, since everyone else seeems inclined to do so. And Jennifer Connelly, as an American journalist who is eager to spread the word of the conflict so that it gets more widespread attention and the flow of these ""blood diamonds"" will stop. As Connelly's character says, ""People back home wouldn't buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone else their hand."" Or maybe they would. Blood Diamond is a story about good and evil, right and wrong, black and white. It's a story of opposites and how different people react to crisis situations. It was entertaining, to say the least, and action-packed and exciting the whole way through. It also had a strong message, solid direction, and a great cast. As other reviewers have noted, the African continent endured war long before the trade of conflict diamonds became worldwide news, but the fact remains that there are many people in the world who probably didn't, and still don't, know much about it. Blood Diamond attempts to shed light on an important issue, and it did so with elegance and precision. I would definitely recommend it, but would add that warning that it is in no way a light film that you will watch and forget. It's message resonates, and will stay with you for days later.

933073,"A few months ago I decided to get some stretch videos after enjoying the rare stretch workout shown on FitTV.  I sit at a computer most of the day and needed something to help with my flexibility and muscle stiffness.  Of the four DVDs I bought, this was by far the best.LeMay has a very soothing voice and encouraging demeanor.  Her instructions are easy to follow and most of the stretches are simple, although I do recommend watching the video once before trying it, just so you know what to expect.  The music is a nice background instrumental and the graphics are basically LeMay on a mat that appears to be gently floating on the clouds with words occasionally floating past.The workout starts with a centering stretch for a few minutes.  Then it goes to the full stretch workout, which is followed by a seated (on the floor) stretch and then a final centering.  If you do the entire thing it's about 28 minutes long, but you can also choose chapters and just do centering, full, or seated.  There's a bonus stretch tacked onto the end of the DVD which is only about 3 minutes long.One of my concerns was how this workout would be for someone like me who is considerably overweight.  I discovered I could do almost all of the stretches within the first 3 times of viewing, although one stretch does involve kneeling on your knees, and that's the only stretch I had problems with.A couple of random things: You will need a lot of floor space for some of the floor stretches.  Also, you'll want to do this at least a couple times a week to get the most benefit from it.I can't recommend this DVD highly enough.  I also recommend catching LeMay's episode of ""All Star Workouts"" on FitTV.  It's a different kind of workout but it's also very good, and we could always use more good stretch workouts.",N/A

501575,"I don't own it yet, however, I am going to; soon as I can get it from Amazon.  I gave it 5 stars back when I first saw it and I still do. I first saw it way back in 1956 or 1957. Those were the last 2 years I spent any time in my home town. After we started our family, I kept our ""home fires burning"" in whichever port his ship was stationed.  I remember one of those was the year I saw the movie, because I was visiting my home town while my husband was ""Away"" on his boat(ship).  At the time, it gave me lots of fear and concern about my husband, because it was so realistic. I saw it with my best girlfriend I grew up with.  I loved it except for it causing me to worry.  I sat and cried all the way through the movie, but I loved it because I loved Jeff Chandler, and of course I related him with my husband. My girlfriend kept telling me ""It's just a movie it's not going to happen to Sam.""  I have seen it on TV several times when one could still catch a good old movie on AMC and TCM. I was thinking the ship was a minesweeper, however, I'm probably wrong since it has been so long since I've seen it. My husband was on a minesweeper when I saw it and those ships are nicknamed ""big splinters"" because if they were to take a bomb or hit one of the mines, there'd be nothing left but splinters due to the fact they were made mostly of wood in order to sweep mines out of the way to make a safe path for bigger fighting ships.  They couldn't be made of any material that would set off a mine or bomb on themselves. So there is something in that movie that I'm not remembering for it to have put that fear into me.  I'll find out when I get the movie and watch again.I thought it was a great movie.  And yes, Jeff Chandler was great in everything.  If he just hadn't passed away at such an early age (34 if my memory serves me)how many more great movies he could have made.And oh yes, my husband served on 3 different minesweepers in addition to 5 other typesSo now, in addition to purchasing nearly all of Amazon's CDs, here I am starting on movies.

437563,"I, personally, was not alive in 1973 -- it was a decade too early for me and my closest friendsBut Ang Lee gave us some glimpses into the landscape of 1970s suburbia, in the wake of the sexual revolution. ""The Ice Storm"" is a chilly, bitterly lonely little drama, with moments of biting humour and poignant alienation between these people. They pass each other, but never touch.The Carvers and Hood live in the same affluent suburban neighborhood, and on the surface all seems well. But self-absorbed Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is having an affair with the icy Janie Carver (Sigourney Weaver), and his daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) is experimenting with Janey's son Mikey (Elijah Wood. And Elena Hood (Joan Allen) is experiencing an identity crisis as a woman.Things start crumbling over Thanksgiving weekend, when Ben finds Wendy and Mikey in a compromising position (which involves a Nixon mask), and Elena figures out the truth about her husband's affair. As an ice storm sweeps over New Canaan, the parents set out to a ""key party,"" all their relationships will reach boiling point -- and a tragedy will strike.The neighborhood of ""The Ice Storm"" is not one you'd want to live in -- people talk but rarely speak, have sex but no intimacy, and can't communicate with their own children and spouses. So it's a credit to Ang Lee's directorial skill that he can actually draw you into this story.And Lee does a really brilliant job of not only illustrating these intertwined, painfully distant relationships, but tying them into the 1970s world. It's like a bunch of beautifully filmed moments strung together -- the kiss in the swimming pool, wintry trysts, biking through the woods, and the awkward Thanksgiving dinner where Wendy goes into a political rant ""prayer"" at grace.Lee seems a bit overfond of ice metaphors and dead leaves, to the point of close-ups of ice-cube trays. Really, enough. But his direction is pitch-perfect -- he paints a delicate, lonely, chilly beauty into every corner of the movie. This is especially true in the second half, when we see the spacey Mikey sliding and running in an icy wonderland.Though it's rather bleak, there are plenty of darkly humorous moments (""Mikey have you heard the explosions coming from the back yard?"" ""I dunno""). But as the story winds on, dialogue becomes much less important -- there are long silences that tell us much more than words. Sorrow, resentment, pain, anger and indifference are all hinted at without a word.And the acting is practically perfect all around. Tobey Maguire serves an important function -- he is the ""normal"" one, an ordinary boy who is hoping to score with a girl. Christina Ricci is excellent as a political nymphet. And Elijah Wood is glorious as Mikey, an endearingly ethereal boy who is obsessed with molecules and squares.As for the adults, Kevin Kline is amazing as the detached Ben, who discovers the hard way what his selfishness has caused. Weaver and Allen are similarly great as two icy women with warm feelings swimming deep inside, but very different ways of dealing with their unhappy marriages.The Criterion Edition is partly making up for the bare-bones treatment ""Ice Storm"" got before. This time, it has new video interviews with author Rich Moody as well as many of the actors -- Allen, Wood, Kline and Ricci. Production designs, deleted scenes and more are also included.The world of ""Ice Storm"" is a cold, barren one, and I'm not just talking about the late-autumn weather. But Ang Lee gives it a cold, poignant brilliance.",Ice Storm VHS
71675,"I saw Psycho back in middle school about ten years ago.  I got my mom to rent it for me b/c she told me how good of a film it was. I remember watching 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' on Nick@Nite which I LOVED, so I decided to check out his movies. I watched PSYCHO all by myself in our finished, yet still creepy den, and was COMPLETELY unprepared for what happened to Marion!  It was obvious that Norm was a little ""off,"" however, like someone else said, he seemed so shy and so awkward that you would have never suspected him.  You would have thought that the extent of his weirdness was being a Peeper.  I was officially creeped out during the shower scene (my mom did not even mention this to me) and just the image of Janet Leigh's pupil and that shower drain was enough to make me turn on the lights.  I'm sitting in the dark in my apartment now watching GOLDEN GIRLS, and just typing about this movie gives me chills. Count me in the number that had to give themselves pep talks to take showers. Anyway, the movie was set up in such a way that you really thought Norman's mother was a menace!  From the creepy window scenes, to the voice, to him carrying ""her"" down the stairs and then the climax at the end, it was one big shocking ride.Fast forward to this triumphant tragedy.  When I used to faithfully read Entertainment Weekly, I remember reading about this remake.  I remember reading and seeing the shot-by-shot images and seeing Anne Heche laying in the tub. I thought ""what a crock!""  I definitely refused to spend my hard earned high school PT job money on this.  So I caught it on some cable channel in college, and I was absolutely offended. First off, if you're going to remake it, at least UPDATE it.  The dialogue was silly b/c obviously society is a lot less worried about being subtle.  You simply cannot be taken seriously when you acknowledge that the time frame is different yet do nothing to move the movie forward 30-plus years. Everything was gratuitous.  Psycho needed no nakedness, no self-pleasuring, etc. Again, where's the subtlety?  It is not a stretch to believe that Norman's stuffed birds got an eyeful after he watched Marion undress. Why is nothing left to the imagination anymore?I agree that only WHMacy and JMoore gave good performances. They are good actors period, but their roles in the original (although John and Vera were great) were not as key as Norman and Marion. Anne and Vince had HUGE shoes to fill. Vince works better in comedy and I can always take or leave Anne. There was no connection w/these characters. Of course Marion was wrong for taking the money, but who can say they didn't hold their breath waiting for the officer to back off? Who didn't hold their breath when Arbogast was interrogating Norman and clearly rattling him (same for Sam)?  None of that exists in this version.About my heading discussing the cover art.  Even though Janet Leigh is screaming on the cover, I still had no idea she DIED and even moreso so EARLY in the film. Contrast that with the obvious bloodbath on this version's cover. Less is more.I really feel for those who only have this version to go by or see this before Hitchcock's brilliant film, and cannot see what a shame this movie is.",N/A
1013061,"I purchased this video so I could inject some spanish flavor into my dance practice. The video will teach you two dances; Gypsy Tango and Farruca. The Gypsy Tango is a fun, folky kind of dance, with feminine hand movements. The Farruca is quite opposite, being a bold toreador style masculine dance that will definitely appeal to those who like drama. (The latter is definitely the more challenging dance!) Puela gives thorough, clear instructions on how to perform the sequence of steps and the camera stays focused in one place (I hate jumping/zooming cameras on exercise or dance vids!!) so you can see her whole body and therefore how she is moving her limbs, so this is perfect for beginners. She has a pleasant personality and a beautiful spanish accent as well as being an accomplished dancer. I especially enjoyed watching her perform the Farruca which she executed wonderfully.Bottom line: Its a fun video for those of us new to flamenco at a price you can't beat.

After all it is suppose to be a comedy, right? 10 minutes into the movie I hadn't even as much as snickered. 20 min was the same and it remained the same through out the movie. I just sat there wondering if I was missing something, but the others in the room assured me I wasn't. It was that bad. I never just stop a movie or walk out on it, but this one I was really tempted to do just that. Very poor narration by Samuel L. Jackson seemed painfully out of place, it would have far funnier if they used a one of those nature show narrator to add to the juxtaposition of the concept. The script was boring and reminded me of the dumb little video bits they did on America's Funniest Animals also with Bob Saget. It was just one of those dumb little video bit drug out for a entire movie, spiced up with bathroom and blue humor to I guess to entertain adults. Nearly every joke was lame and nothing near the quality of humor a number of this comic were capable of delivering.

What can I tell you?. Well, I can tell you that this is a fine, fine film done with such artistry and talent from Marty, as everyone calls him. I am not always an easy sell on crime/mobster type films, but you can't help but be intrigued by the magnitude of talent going into this, and the big acclaim that came upon it's release. The Departed may not be the best film ever made, but it's a great film, and the best film of the year. Surprising, twisty, and unrelentingly violent, It holds you rapt from start to finish. Jack Nicholson is mobster Frank Costello, who plants a mole in the Boston police force. This is up and comer Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon). The ppolice themselves have a mole to plant in Costello's group, Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio). The result is a tense and taut cat and mouse thriller as the two moles try to discover the other's identity. DiCaprio really starts to become an adult movie star here. This is the first time where he seems to not just be a kid. He is grown up, dark, and wonderful in the role. Damon keeps his cool throughout, but he is less showy and impressive. Jack. Where to start?. There is a bit of ""Jack"" here, but that's okay. He is always electrifying with whatever he does, and he takes hold of every scene he's in and doesn't let it, or you the viewer, go. He means business. Wahlberg is great in the role. At first, he is extremely unlikeable, but you like him as time goes on. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone all give stellar supporting performances. It runs on a bit long, and I wasn't totally satisfied with how certain things came to and end, but they are minor quibbles. The film is set in Boston, but I heard it was actually filmed in and around New York. Interesting. People talk about sloppy work here, but I can't find it. The film is done with delicate care and talent. It felt raw. It felt real. It was exciting, and it seems that no one is safe. It keeps you on your toes. The ongoing character development with Leo's character makes him the most interesting out of the bunch. The relationship between Jack and his mole and his new buddy(Leo), makes for some interesting storytelling and twists and turns. The characters are deep and fully fleshed out, the story keeps you interested, and the music used in the film and the score are perfect. All in all, it's a great film. While people continue to voice their thoughts on how this ranks in Scorsesse's roster of films, and how this was(or was not)his best film since whatever, all I can say is that this is a Scorsesse picture.

538849,"In BLOW, Johnny Depp gives us one of his earlier but no less brilliant performances as George Jung, the premier American cocaine importer of the 1980s.A film heavily influenced by Scorsese's GOODFELLAS and CASINO, BLOW is as frenetic as its namesake drug. We watch Jung grow up in a stressful household with a shrewish mother (Rachel Griffiths) and an easygoing father (Ray Liotta); Ms. Griffiths' characterization as Ermine Jung is so reminiscent of Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill in GOODFELLAS that I initially confused the two actresses. Liotta of course, played Henry Hill.George flees his childhood home for the endless sunshine of Southern California circa 1967, where, dedicated to the proposition that he will never be poor, he begins to deal drugs. A minor pot bust leads to an association with Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, and George soon builds his small-scale operation into the major North American llello pipeline.His vast wealth (literally hundreds of millions of dollars over the years) leads to the predictable vast excesses (think Tony Montana in SCARFACE) and George's hedonistic lifestyle comes crashing down in a white cloud of confusion, betrayal and self-destruction. Depp captures it all perfectly, without caricaturing any of it, an impressive accomplishment when one considers how easily the Cocaine Universe lent itself to cartoonishness in the mid-Eighties. George Jung ultimately was convicted of smuggling and was sentenced to a horrifying sixty years.Despite George's Colombian connections, he remained a small-town American boy at heart, and Depp deftly and subtlely demonstrates to us George's increasing sense of isolation and disorientation in the midst of the drug culture. In the end, George Jung is left nothing but his sense of aching emptiness as he pines for his daughter Kristina, who, the film tells us as it ends, has never visited her father.George Jung is seen in the Special Features as a broken, sad and lonely man, condemned to spending most of the rest of his life behind bars. The hardest blow fell on George Jung. Was it worth it?",N/A
1022497,The good is that these movies were finally released on DVD. The bad is that it was only at Best Buy and I didn't know about it until last week and did not get a set. The the ugly is that scalpers are selling the set for over 150.00 dollars. Does anybody know if the set is going to be released again at the original price that I understand was 20.00 dollars? I sure hope it is as I would really like to get these movies but will not pay 150.00 dollars. If you know any information please post. Thanks,The Classic Sci-fi Ultimate Collection
1068405,"NOTE.  The yoga sequences on this DVD contain footage which  has previously appeared on Jennifer Kries' Hot Body Cool Mind series DVDs.In this DVD, instructor Jennifer Kries presents Yin Yoga, a style of yoga in which the postures are held at length, usually up to 10-15 minutes.  However, Jennifer and her two background exercises do NOT hold the postures for the recommended length; instead, they hold each pose for approximately 10 breaths, with Jennifer encouraging you to hold the poses longer on your own.  In her Introduction to this DVD, Jennifer calls Yin Yoga the ""un-workout,"" noting that it is cooling, calming, and restoring; she also refers to the practice as ""needle-less acupuncture.""  All postures are performed entirely on the floor.The Main Menu offers the following selections:  Introduction, Workouts (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), Yin Yoga and Meridian Theory Interview, Credits, and About Jennifer.  The three workouts contain very similar postures and footage, but additional poses are added as the difficultly level increases.  However, the workouts would more appropriately be called ""Short, Medium, Long,"" as it is mainly the length rather than the difficultly level which increases; furthermore, Jennifer has her background exercisers display various levels of difficulty in all three workouts.  Throughout each practice, Jennifer talks about the meridian pairs addressed by each posture, noting some of the benefits/effects that you might experience.The Beginner workout is about 20 minutes long and includes butterfly, full seated forward bend, child's pose (Jennifer recommends performing this pose between all of the postures but only shows it only the one time), dragonfly (wide-leg seated forward bend), thread the needle, reclined twist (aka revolved stomach pose), savasana (relaxation), and final meditation. The Intermediate practice comes in around 23 minutes and includes full forward bend, child's pose, saddle (similar to 1-leg reclined hero), choice of shoelace (bull seat or the legs from cow-face pose) or ankle to knee (double pigeon), pigeon, quarter dog, reclined twist, and relaxation/final meditation.  Finally, the Advanced workout is 33 minutes long; the postures include include butterfly, a choice of seal (similar to cobra) or saddle, seated forward bend, dragon, a choice of shoelace or eye of the needle or ankle to knee, pigeon, wide-legged child's pose, dragonfly, quarter dog, reclined twist, dead bug, cross-legged seated forward bend with crossed arms, and relaxation/final meditation.In the Yin Yoga and Meridian Theory Interview, Jennifer interviews a friend of hers who is a shiatsu practitioner.  The interview begins with an explanation of ""yin"" and continues with talking about Chinese element theory and how this impacts emotions.  The conversation then moves into a discussion of exactly how the ""Makko-Ho's"" (exercises to address meridian pairs) target various meridians in the body.  At this point, Jennifer calls upon a male and female dancer to demonstrate some of the Yin yoga postures while she and her friend point out the affected areas of the body.  This segment is 9 minutes long.Overall, I really liked the Yin sequences on this DVD; I find the soothing effects of Yin Yoga to be a nice alternative to my usual hatha yoga practice.  However, the one thing I didn't like is that Jennifer does not allow enough time in each pose.  In order to do the Yin practices the way she recommends (ie, holding each posture 10-15 minutes), you would need to pause the DVD and keep track of the elapsed time on your own, which I find to be awkward.  Still, this is a very good introduction to Yin Yoga which provides a nice variety of options for all levels of yoga practitioners.",N/A

1056826,"Dr. Garrigan(James McAvoy) graduates from medical school and heads to Uganda to escape his overbearing father and fullfill his idealistic dreams of helping the poor. Through his eyes we see a nation in the grip of a military takeover under the powerful and mad despot Idi Amin. Forest Whitaker gives a stunning, mesmerizing performance. When Dr. Garrigan witnesses then helps Idi Amin after a car accident, Idi Amin is taken by the young doctor and offers him a job as his personal physician. Against his better judgement and against the advice of some more world weary Brits, Dr. Garrigan is taken in by the affable and personable dictator. Much like the nation is until the dark side of the man is revealed. In an incredible scene when he is first presented Forest Whitaker shows the persona, the danger and the monster of Idi Amin. You know this is road to danger but you can't help but follow the powerful story. Dr. Garrigan's naivety is sometimes unbelievable but this movie is wonderfully shot, told and written.",N/A
155322,"This is perhaps the best of Woody Allens early films. Its pure slapstick from beginning to end with some side-splitting moments. Woody plays Miles Monroe a shop-keeper who is woken from a frozen state 200 years in the future. The initial scenes after Miles is woken clearly inspired Mike Myers for the first Austin Powers film as this later film contains a scene that is very similar. Diane Keaton as usual is very good as Luna who helps Miles in his attempts to overthrow an authoritarian government.The rest of the film maintains an inspired level of humour with the usual quota of great one-liners such as:Luna: ""It's hard to believe that you haven't had sex for 200 years.""Miles: ""204, if you count my marriage.""The soundtrack features Woody Allen playing Clarinet with a traditional Jazz band which adds a character all of its own to the film. In fact at times the film is reminisent of an early silent comedy because of this, rather than a 1970's movie. There is no doubt in my mind that if Allen had been born 30 or 40 years earlier he would have been a great star in the silent film era.Great stuff and even if you're not a fan of Woody Allen you'll still probably enjoy this.",N/A
606737,"I know of friends who only saw the first Matrix movie and that is a shame, as all three parts of the trilogy belong together as the journey of Neo and the change that happens to him along the way. It is a fantastic job that has been done in keeping the quality at the top without descending into making B-grade follow up movies as is often the case with sequels.It is a movie that can be seen on many levels. Some will see it just as a great action movie which it is, but there is so much more to this film. It is a fantastic depiction of the journey of the spiritual seeker and the difficulties that he encounters within himself as he starts pushing against the prisons of his own mind and the multitude of programs that operates and which keep us small.It also neatly depicts the way humans are kept as 'food for the moon' in Gurdjieff's words or simply food for ultra terrestrials. In the film this is depicted as humans, being little less than cultivated biological batteries for the machines.The story is part of a trilogy and all three parts are worth watching more than once, as you will undoubtedly see new things each time. Things that start making sense only after some time of reflection and reading. In this regard I can recommend reading the book by Ouspensky called ""In Search of the Miraculous"", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called ""The Secret History of the World"".",N/A

Very few movies actuall LOOK old in HD.The bad part is, this ""director's cut"" sucks!  They claim it was how he originally wanted it to be, but if that were true, he could have done it!  There were no technology restrictions back then!  All he did was butcher this film in an attempt to try an modernize it and make it look 'cool' for the young people of today while completely forgetting about those who grew up with the film!This comic book transistions BS is a distraction while watching.  It makes it look silly.  I know the film on a whole (the gangs) look silly now, but you can deal with that on it's own without them trying to make it look as if they made it look silly on purpose.  Also, many songs in the film run a lot longer and overlap dialog that was previously there!  This is also distracting and takes away some of the suspense.  They even totally edited out the end 'walk on the beach scene' and replaced it with a static comic strip!  That alone ruined this 'cut.'  That scene said alot.  It represented the end, the end as in the Warriors are presumably going home and the end of the movie.  It is also the memorable scene I recall of cabel all those years ago.  These cuts were almost as bad as the Star Wars DVD's!What they should do is to in clude the original intro which truly sets up the story.  Forget that it took place in the daylight!  They should alos include all deleted scens to give in some length and GET RID OF THE COMIC BOOK BS!The sound is horrible!  That is, the Dolby Digital.

The quality is simply amazing, even a better remaster than some other HD-DVDs like Serenity. The colors are way more vibrant and the detail is incredible. During the famous lobby action scene I swear you can see every single scrap of tile, speck of dust and individual bullet. You will see details in the background you never knew were there. This is the Matrix at its finest.As a test to the quality, I had the original widescreen DVD and this new HD-DVD playing back-to-back on my Samsung 32"" LCD. Quickly switching back and forth between formats I could not believe the difference. In comparison, it made the original DVD look like a bootleg VHS copy. I kid you not. Some scenes on HD-DVD look so real its like you are staring out the window. If you don't yet have an HD-DVD player, this is a great first set to pick up with the player and a great movie to show off to friends how good HD-DVD really is.As a note, I bought this version over the ""Ultimate"" collection for a few reasons. One being that the Animatrix on the Ultimate edition (along with all the other bonus content) is only in 480p. Since I already own the original Animatrix DVD, theres not much point. The Complete Trilogy still includes a decent amount of bonus features and you can get a free download of the Animatrix if you have an Xbox360. Also, the Complete version has nice looking disc art, while the Ultimate version has blank looking 2-sided discs.

949787,"Professional transporter Frank Martin (Jason Statham) has surfaced once more for movie fans everywhere. A specialist in transporting goods from one spot to another without getting involved, Frank is the best there is. His current gig? Chauffer for a well to do family, the father of which is a member high in Washington's bureaucracy.Making sure that the official's son gets from one place to another, Frank ends up not only driving but getting involved with the young boy as well. So much for not getting involved. The two have a strong rapport and Frank teaches the boy things as well. On an ordinary trip to the pediatrician, the boy is kidnapped and Frank is thought of as the most likely suspect.Face it, fans of the TRANSPORTER films know right up front that there is no way that Frank Martin will let this kidnapping go on without a hitch or un-avenged. While the FBI and local police search for clues, Frank begins his one man battle not only to find the boy but to make sure that he is returned unharmed. The same can't be said for the bad guys that cross Frank's path.Both TRANSPORTER films relied heavily on action and taking a not so serious look at the genre that they attempt to command. And they both do just that, making us believe that Frank is capable of the feats he performs when fighting hand to hand or when using whatever objects are at his disposal to render those who cross his path inoperable.Jason Statham is not the usual gorgeous face that most leading men offer when a role like this comes along. Instead he seems more real, more deadly. And this sense of reality in appearance coupled with the unreality of the story lines and action seems to be a match made in heaven.Corrie Yuen returns as stunt choreographer for the fight sequences of this film and his work is probably the best that there is today in film. Nowhere else can you find the kicks, leaps and pummeling fists provided in such a ballet like form as in those that feature his work. Its enough that it makes you want to seek out more that he has been involved with.Director Louis Letterier, who helmed the first film along with Yuen as well as the recent UNLEASHED, will be a force to reckon with in the world of action films. Imaging his eye for detail and views of action sequences put to use in a Bond film would make the most die hard fan salivate.Sequels never seem to live up the expectations of fans of the first film. There is no way to replicate the first viewing of something different. It becomes old the second it is seen. The same can be said of this one, though it runs circles around most new films being released. And though a sequel, it does what so many films these days seem unable to do. It entertains.",N/A
652334,"I watched ""The Bridge to Terabithia"" on a whim with my wife and daughter with little foreknowledge of the plot. I'd never read the Newbery Award-winning book by Katherine Paterson, and I'd seen only one trailer for the film, which left me with the impression it would be a Narnia knock-off. It's not.I'm not dissing ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" which in its way was a remarkable film. But ""Terabithia"" didn't deserve the CGI-laden marketing campaign it received; far from a fantasy blockbuster, this is a deep and thoughtful movie that places substance over sparkle -- a rare treat in the sprawling field of youth-oriented theater. It ranks up there with one of my favorites, ""The Secret of Roan Inish,"" which accomplished more with no special effects than most family-friendly movies could with a billion-dollar budget.But I just can't shake ""Terabithia"" from my head, a fact owed mostly to the performance of AnnaSophia Robb. As Leslie, a spirited young girl with a fiery imagination and endless good cheer, AnnaSophia captured my heart. She's the kind of person you want to know when you're a child and, as my wife remarked midway through the film, she's the sort of young woman you'd be happy to see your daughter grow up to be.An outsider despite her youthful good looks and family wealth, she finds her perfect match in Jesse (Joss Hutcherson), another outsider who has withdrawn into his art to escape a chilly home life and his own problems at school. Together, they discover a secret getaway that might seem like a fairly ordinary patch of woods to most people; to them, it's a magical world replete with fantastic creatures, hidden dangers and amazing triumphs. It's here the special effects intrude more than accentuate the film; the story would have benefited from a vaguer sense of Jesse and Leslie's own wonder. We don't need to see CGI creatures to believe that these two children do.The strength here, besides outstanding performances from the two lead actors, is the impact of a story that knows no amount of fantasy can prevent real-life tragedies from occurring. And the tragedy here -- it's hard to write about it without giving it away -- slams into unsuspecting viewers like a sudden kick to the gut.Parents of younger viewers should be prepared to have a long and serious talk with their children after this movie, but that's not a recommendation to avoid it. ""Terabithia"" deserves to be seen, discussed and seen again. (Although use some discretion; very young children should wait before seeing this.) My thanks to director Gabor Csupo, as well as writer Paterson, for giving kids something honest and real rather than another serving of high-energy fluff.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor",Bridge to Terabithia
807535,"Without judging the vast amount of special features, I'm going to say that Wrestlemania XX was not all it was hyped up to be.  Many of the matches were truly great, and the return of the real Undertaker was momentous, but it fell short in that typical WWE way and somehow managed to botch one of their potentially stellar main events into a laughably simplistic match that could have easily taken place on a TV show without notice.United States ChampionshipThe Big Show (C) vs John CenaAny match that features John Cena is bound to be a dissapointment.  I think the ECW fans at One Night Stand 2006 flawlessly summed him up and there's no need to do much else here other than say he can't wrestle, and his gimmick is by far the worst thing WWE has ever done in recent years.  I would much rather have the Katie Vick storyline brought back than see Cena in the WWE, much less as a main eventer.  He is a bumbling failure in this match, and the Big Show is not much of a wrestler himself, but at least he has the stage presence to make himself truly felt.  John Cena's victory here made the whole match like trying to swallow a bitter pill and throwing it back up.  (0/10 and that's being generous)World Tag Team ChampionshipRob Van Dam and Booker T (C) vs Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak vs The Dudley Boyz vs La ResistanceWhoever devised this whole fatal four way tag, where only two men are in the ring, and any random person can randomly tag any other random person whether they're on their team or not, is an idiot.  Aside from the poor stipulations, the combatants were at their best and put on a great match.  (7/10)Chris Jericho vs ChristianThe storyline behind this match was, uncharacteristic for the WWE, a good one and believable.  Christian's already proven to me at Insurrextion 2003 that he's an astounding singles wrestler, and Jericho is great on his own.  They put on a superb match that really stands out in the night.  (8/10)Rock 'n Sock Connection vs EvolutionThis one was hyped up to a point of awkwardness.  The promo Randy Orton did with Batista and Ric Flair at his side was a complete fumbling that made me smack my forehead at how awkward it was.  The friendship in the ring between The Rock and Mick Foley is awkward as well.  Foley pretty much summed up the match in the extras post-match interview: ""It wasn't my best"".  We all quite saw it out there too.  (3/10)Evening Gown MatchSable and Torrie Wilson vs Jackie Gayda and Stacey KieblerWas there even a point in them getting dressed in gowns?  They just stripped down to their bra and panties before the match started and spent a good 3 or 4 minutes bouncing around Diva-style (ie, not wrestling) and showing the crowd their butts and crotches.  I can't even justify this with a rating.  It was not good.WWE Cruiserweight Championship Cruiserweight OpenChavo Guerrero (C) vs Rey Mysterio vs Jamie Noble vs Billy Kidman vs Ultimo Dragon vs Little Guido (I mean, Nunzio) vs Tajiri vs Funaki vs Shannon MooreI think this was perhaps one of the best matches of the night.  It wasn't long enough, but virtually everyone was high impact and at their best.  One by one, superstars would battle one-on-one battles, defeat their opponent, and another would come in.  The only disappointment was Chavo's ""cowardly heel"" ending.  (10/10)Goldberg vs Brock LesnarBoth men were about to leave the WWE, and I guess the fans knew it.  I had read that the fans abused both men, hated them both for leaving, and really tore into them.  I'm guessing whoever wrote that never saw an ECW match.  The fans really seemed confused here.  They cheered Goldberg as he entered, they didn't seem to know when to boo as Lesnar and Goldberg stood off in the ring.  Only once did they start singing that goodbye song to Lesnar, and they seemed really confused whether to cheer Goldberg or not.  The match was very low-impact, and it took a good five or six minutes for the two to start the fight.  A huge disappointment.  The fans were confused and dumb as ever, only cheering when Stone Cold Steve Austin gave the stunner to both men.  (0/10)WWE Tag Team ChampionshipRikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty (C) vs APA vs Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas vs The Basham BrothersAgain, the same stipulation as I mentioned in the previous tag team fatal four way.  Someone must have been drunk on the after-party wine already in this match, because Faarooq wasn't involved officially in the match at all, Bradshaw did very little, and all in all the match was very unimpressive from Shelton or Charlie or the APA.  It boiled down mostly to Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi vs The Basham Brothers vs Bradshaw.  The Bashams seemed to receive most of the attention from the bookers, and did the most in the ring.  (4/10)WWE Women's ChampionshipMolly Holly vs Victoria (C)The stipulation of this match stated that if Molly lost, she'd get her head shaved.  Guess what happened.  Yeah well like I have said many times before, if WWE refuses to let it's Women's division rise above mediocrity, they shouldn't populate their expensive PPVs with lousy women's matches! (0/10)WWE ChampionshipEddie Guerrero (C) vs Kurt AngleThis match was heavily built up with all sorts of emotion in the storyline and both men were given over 20 minutes to battle.  Compared to Guerrero's main event match the month before against Brock Lesnar, this one was mediocre.  This one could barely qualify as ""average"" on a regular Smackdown show.  As this was a Smackdown main event, and Smackdown is always the second-rate show, this one was done before the RAW event and even before the Undertaker and Kane match.  The only good part was Eddie Guerrero's unique way of screwing Kurt Angle by pretending his ankle was hurt, unlacing his boot, and when Angle comes at him with an ankle lock, Eddie slides out by yanking his foot out of his boot.  (4/10)The Undertaker vs KaneThis had been built up for months after the Undertaker was buried alive at Survivor Series 2003.  It's a good thing they buried that American Bad Ass biker gimmick, and brought back the REAL Undertaker---the Deadman.  Unfortunately, he still wears that stupid biker tanktop, and his Sara tattoo is very noticeable.  Kane is not the same Kane, but rather a fat bald idiot who is truly ugly and a poor wrestler.  At least Undertaker returns truly  (6/10)World Heavyweight ChampionshipChris Benoit vs Triple H (C) vs Shawn MichaelsI was expecting wonders from this match based on all the other reviews.  I was expecting some tour de force that WWE has been severely lacking.  I was severely disappointed by the hype.  Triple H barely does much, while Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels have some entertaining back-and-forth action, but mostly it boils down to brawling, with 70-80% of the match being made up of pillowstrikes and basic generic brawler moves like DDTs and Suplexes.  The only really amazing point in the match is where Michaels and Triple H doubleteam against Benoit and suplex him from atop the Spanish Announcer's Table onto the Smackdown Table.  Everything else hardly qualified as average.  Like the Smackdown main event, it qualifies as a ""good"" main event for the average RAW show.  (5.5/10)All in all, it was a decent Wrestlemania, but the failure of the main events and the lackluster events numbering more than two makes this three out of five stars, unfortunately.  Bad bad bad WWE.  For shame.",N/A

However if the quality is as high as this then that is no problem. This film is more sympathetic a portrait of Truman Capote with a cast and script of a higher standard. Daniel Craig is electifying as one of the murderers and worth the cost alone. The film has not had a lot of publicity but do not let this put you off - its one of the best.",N/A

For those who enjoyed ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" ""The Wire"" improves on the gritty drama of life on Baltimore's mean streets. To all those that complain that TV is whitebreadland, check this series out. A host of African American actors turn in top-notch performances from the Cheif of Police right down to drug dealers. Idris Elba's portrayal of Stringer Bell is outstanding along with the rest of the cast. TV drama just doesn't get any better than this.",The Wire: Season 3
278635,"Frankly, all that saves this film from mediocrity is the stellar cast. Reginald Owen is faced with a part that has little character development, but manages to express a range of emotions and make the peripheral view of Scrooge which the script allows believeable. Gene Lockhart, as a sacked Bob Cratchitt who maintains a pleasant demeanour not to ruin Christmas for his family, does a superb job in a rather cartoonish version of the character - seeming to be the ultimate fun-loving, devoted father.The film certainly is suitable family fare. The magic of Victorian toys, circles of Blind Man's Buff at Fred's party, the laughing Cratchitt's at the table, and cinematography which capture a fictional but ""museum village"" view of ""Dickens London"" would be especially suited to children, since the dark side of the story is nearly entirely eliminated. There is nothing to trouble the very young, who indeed might find the Cratchitt home to be a place where they might care to visit.Yet the adaptation is a poor rendition for any lover of Dickens. Scrooge seems to be in self imposed loneliness, and insensitive towards his clerk, but (aside from the 'surplus population' line, which seems more a rebuff to charity collectors than an indication of Scrooge's miserly nature) there is no hint of, for example, Ignorance and Want and the tragedies arising from these. Most of the scenes from Dickens, when Scrooge is visited by any of the three spirits, have been eliminated. For example, in Christmas Present, none of the tragic, sordid plight of the poor is shown, nor is Scrooge's hardness of heart. We merely see him watch a party at Fred's (and beg the spirit to stay for the rest of the games), and want to hear Bob Cratchitt tell the rest of the story of Aladdin to his unusually happy family. Scrooge suddenly calls out that he 'loves Christmas,' and the effect is of one who did not know how to enjoy company rather than one whose heart is hardened with greed. Nor do the Christmas Past sequences, which are limited to his going home for Christmas with his sister and remembering Fezziwig's including him in Christmas dinner, include any of Scrooge's adult life.The plot has no depth, and characterisation is shallow. My impression was that it was intended to capture a mythical Christmas where all have fun and frolic. The only note of pathos is in the future, seeing the Cratchitts weep for Tiny Tim.It is a pleasant holiday diversion, good for nostalgia or for keeping the children occupied whilst one stuffs the turkey, but it bears little resemblance to Dickens.",Christmas Carol VHS

Long story short, I bought it after seeing it.I knew the story about what had happened in 1999 ahead of time and decided to see it put on the big screen. I loved this movie! I really felt for the kid at the end of the movie. The director really made you like him and you find yourself hoping that they let the kid go but knowing the true story it makes you queasy knowing what lies ahead for the poor kid. If you had no idea about the true story you would think Timberlake would of let the kid go at the end and then the good ole happy ending comes true.............nope!Speakings of Justin Timberlake, I can't stand his music (makes me puke) but his acting skills are incredible!

I also thought the acting was suberb.I lower the rating by one because of the unneccesary placement of the F word from Beyonce's character (I can't stand movies that put it in there to make sure they get a PG13 rating) and another point because it was probably about 30 minutes too long and some of the characters weren't developed as much as they should, like Eddie Murphy's and the Dreamgirl that he was sleeping with.Overally good but not great.",N/A
1041351,"As a novelist, I couldn't help but sit down for two hours with this movie. I've seen other ""writer"" flicks, ranging from ""Finding Forrester"" to ""Author, Author."" Enjoyable, yes. Entertaining, sure. But not always thought-provoking, and certainly not accurate depictions of my own creative process. So, with low expectations, I popped in the DVD. The buzz surrounding the film had died, leaving me and Will Farrell and Emma Thompson to share a story together.The story is simple. A man named Harold Crick begins to hear a woman's voice in his head. She is narrating his life, with surprising accuracy. The woman is a novelist facing time pressure from her publisher. She has writer's block, unable to choose the appropriate demise for her main character, also named Harold Crick. The fictional and real-life characters are one and the same, sharing the fate decided by the writer.From the creative opening sequences, to the slow unveiling of Farrell's character, to the difficult final decision of Thompson's novelist, ""Stranger than Fiction"" never gets off track. Each time the pacing seems it may flag, another element or payoff reengages the viewer. Thompson plays one of her best roles in years. Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah, and Hoffman add their stellar acting to the mix. In contrast to the higher-grossing ""Talledega Nights,"" Farrell proves he can be a riveting screen presence even when subdued.Funny, warm, and life-affirming, ""Stranger than Fiction"" explores the world in an unconventional way. By the end, we feel so comfortable here that it seems almost, well, conventional. Almost the way it should be. On the part of the writer, director, and cast, that's the mark of a job well done.",N/A
1083117,"Three months before Shia LaBeouf's leading role in the Summer of 2007's blockbuster Transformers, he appeared in Disturbia. And he seems to have gotten into the same character for his roles in both films: a kind of missing link from Scooby Doo's gangScooby Doo, Where Are You! - The Complete First and Second Seasons.""Every killer lives next door to someone"" is the tagline on the movie poster, and the movie's trailer expands on the spoiler-tagline by coming right out with the detail of how a high school senior (LaBeouf) living under house-arrest discovers his neighbor is a serial killer. So all that's left untold for viewers in Disturbia is what LaBeeouf's character and friends do about it.Disturbia makes frequent attempts at humor, but most of the intended funny moments border on corny. The target audience of this movie clearly comes off as 13 - 24 year olds...the Scream crowdScream Trilogy - Boxed Set. But Disturbia is far from how well done the Scream films were done. Kids and young adults will find some of the humor in Disturbia amusing, but serious thriller fans will tire quickly of some of the campyness.There are some good, thrilling moments in Disturbia, but the suspense is lost in how predictable the movie is...especially after how much of the plot is deliberately given in advance to viewers that saw the trailer.Overall the movie was good, and the I-just-have-to-see-what-happens-next factor kept me interested enough to be entertained.

The disk is too small to make a good frisbee and the story (which is supposed to be a psychological thriller) is neither psychological nor is it a thriller.Here is the story so you don't have to waste your time watching it.  Keaton plays a salesman who is set up to mentor a new man from the midwest.  The new man is engaged, so naturally Keaton's character, who is a really nasty fellow, starts having sex with his fiancee.  What he does not know is, the fiancee is a prostitute hired by a man who wants to take over the company.  Somehow Keaton's affair brings down the entire sales office and helps bring down the value of the company (since other prostitutes have been hired to sabotage other sales offices across the country.)  This creates an opportunity for the fellow who engineered the whole thing to buy the company for a cut rate price.  Keaton's character loses his job, finds out he's been played for a sap by a hooker, and then goes back to his old job at Northwestern University as a college prof.  The story ends with the people who set all this up laughing at him.  That is supposed to be a thrilling surprise ending, except that it makes no sense.  Furthermore, the characters are all so unlikeable there is no reason any of us should care one way or the other - and we don't.I gave this one star because the system would not let me give it zero stars or twenty raspberries.Amazon's got lots of great movies for sale.

I could nearly hear Ray Harryhausen roll in his grave.I would recommend this movie to use as a coaster. I've seen better infomercials. I've seen silent films (e.g. ""Metropolis"") and know they were trying* for that silent film feel, but sorry, you all did not get it.If you want real Lovecraftian horror, I recommend instead watchingIn the Mouth of Madness...which is almost 'more Lovecraft than Lovecraft'.",The Call of Cthulhu
1126255,"A demon named Grendel rampages through the feasting hall of King Hrothgar and smashes grown men as if they were china dolls.  Hrothgar sends out a call for heroes to come and fight the demon and Beowulf shows up to accept the challenge.  He and his men spend the night in the hall and Beowulf ends up taking on the monster virtually single-handed.  Grendel's mother, also a demon, retaliates and Beowulf goes to confront her.  This is where the story begins to diverge significantly from the original epic as Beowulf is seduced by her beauty and promises of fame and fortune and then must deal with the consequences later in life.The strength of this movie lies in the voice acting.  Anthony Hopkins, Brendan Gleeson, and John Malkovich are particularly strong and well suited to their parts.  The greatest weakness to the film was the decision to use all CGI, even motion capturing all of the actors.  Many scenes looks cheap and fake, even though they would have been easy to do using sets and live action.  The characters have waxy faces and often move stiffly and jerkily, and often seem unnatural.  The story changes were apparently an attempt to make the tale more tragic and more personal but the wisdom was questionable.  This Beowulf is no longer a hero, just a fraud.This is not a great movie, but it isn't bad for someone looking for simple action fare.  As long as you can set aside the odd look of the CGI characters, the action scenes look pretty good.  This movie may be popular on DVD where fans can skip to the chapters that are more dynamic and skip the nonsensical attempts at drama between battles.",N/A

562745,"""Maximum Overdrive"" (1986) is what you would get if you crossed ""Duel"" with ""Night of the Living Dead"" and significantly amped up the parody component of each film (there is a little ""Temors"" here as well). Not exactly highbrow, it is considerably more entertaining than its rating score would indicate; especially if you can connect with the parody element.Written and directed by Stephen King on a very modest special effects budget, the story shifts between idyllic small-town and redneck truck stop somewhere in North Carolina. A UFO has somehow gained control over most machines (insert ""Metropolis"" here) which proceed to slaughter a considerable number of people.Neither the film nor King's original story seem to have anything profound to say about aliens, humans, or machines. That is probably for the best as deep philosophy would only get in the way of the entertainment value of this thing.Like the farm house in ""Night of the Living Dead"", those who remain alive take refuge in a nearby truck stop. Pat Hingle gives an over-the-top performance as the greedy owner who just happens to have a small arsenal of weapons concealed on the premises. Yeardley Smith as a stressed-out newlywed provides additional comic relief. Emilio Estavez and Laura Harrington provide the story's romantic element. Music is by King's favorite band AC/DC. Although everything from lawnmowers to blow dryers get into the act, most of the focus is on the eighteen-wheelers which besiege the truck stop around the clock.Then again, what do I know?

In the earlier film it was easier to distinguish the evil from the good...here characters are edgier and perhaps darker.The story begins when a young, pretty Jewish woman tries to flee to Belgium from Nazi occupied Holland but her family is betrayed, massacred and robbed along with other Jewish families.  After a nail-biting escape,Rachel (Carice Van Houten), joins the Resistance and agrees to infiltrate the Gestapo headquarters.  Surprisingly, she becomes attached to one of the officers, and the tale begins a spin into betrayal and counterbetrayal...so that enemies and friends are very hard to distinguish.There is a lot of old-fashioned World War II suspense and action thatrolls the story along.  But ultimately, this is a film about how hard it is to identify villains and heroes, when everyone is wearing a mask...including Rachel,of course - who is hiding her Jewish identity.Overall, the film sizzles more than Soldier of Orange, but the original World War II film is still the better steak.

However, there are some positive aspects to this film.First, Lassie (1994) is considerably more contemporary than most 'Lassie' films yet has a collie as the hero. (This might interest children ages 8 through 13 who enjoy action and dogs.)Second, the film has a theme I appreciate - a theme of reaching out to others when others treat you cruely or degradingly.Third, the film kept my attention more than other Lassie films or films with canine stars.[While I enjoyed Old Yeller and Air Bud (1998), many dog films such as The Shaggy Dog (both 1959 and 2006), Where the Red Fern Grows, Shiloh, Far From Home, etc. either were incredible unrealistic or failed to keep my attention for long.]However, there is merit in the response, ""This film is too violent and uses foul language."" While this Lassie film is no Stand By Me or Jaws, it isn't Mr. Roger's Neighborhood either. Some words are included in this film that parents may not appreciate their five year olds hearing, and some scenes (while not very violent) have undertones that are more likely to 'scare' parents than children.I do not desire to give away the plot to the reader. However, the film begins with Lassie's real owner being killed in a tractor-trailer accident on wet roads. Based on this description, it is possible for the reader to further realize this is not a ""sugar-coated"" motion picture.Overall, I would recommend this film to parents who have allowed their children to view 101 Dalmatians (live action) and/or films such as To Kill a Mockingbird.

1055729,"The cinematography and CGI in Charlotte's Web is spot on. Somehow the filmmakers managed to maintain a dramatic, realistic look and feel, while still maintaining a childlike wonder of life on the farm. All the animals look completely realistic, even when they're talking, which is an accomplishment.The biggest drawback is that when they're talking, they're not always interesting. This similar problem has arisen in many animated films lately, and shows itself here as well: studios think that casting a name actor is the same as casting a character voice actor. It just doesn't always work. The name actors just sound like themselves, and don't put anything into their characters. The excepttion in this film is Steve Buscemi, who manages to create an enjoyable Templeton with an interesting voice. Robert Redford as a horse shines a little bit on occasion as does John Cleese as a sheep. The rest of the talent is borderline lifeless. Cedric the Entertainer and Oprah Winfrey as geese are forgettable, as are Reba McEntire and Kathy Bates as cows and Thomas Haden Church and Andre3000 as crows. The ultimate disappointment in the voice talent is Julia Roberts as Charlotte. She hardly puts any life into her voice, much less any characterization. While the other voice actors were merely forgettable, Roberts is a detriment to the film. Hopefully filmmakers will learn that name actors are not necessarily voice actors as well. They use their body to act, while cartoon actors just use their voice. It's a completely different talent.The film itself is entertaining and sweet; almost too sweet. The amount of mood music that plays to inspire you to start tearing up gets a little out of hand, but that's to be expected from such a family friendly film based on a classic book.Overall, this film is very pleasant relaxing experience, and if you have kids it's definitely worth checking out.

In a sense it is, but in another sense it is a serious documentary about a national epidemic whose name is obesity. Here in California, a recent newspaper article reported that only one quarter of 1.3 million school children tested could pass minimal physical fitness requirements. At the current rate, obesity will pass smoking as the leading cause of preventable death. Perhaps it is unfair that Super Size Me picks on McDonalds, but it is, nevertheless, far and away the largest purveyor and most powerful icon of junk food morbidity. What would happen, wondered Morgan Spurlock, if he ate three meals a day for 30 days at McDonalds? This film shows you. He followed three rules: everything he ate had to be on the Mickey D menu; he had to sample every offering at least once; and he would only order ""super size"" when prompted by the cashier. Spurlock consumed about 5,000 calories a day of sugar, fat and salt, added 25 pounds, jacked his blood pressure and cholesterol numbers into the stratosphere, experienced head aches and chest pains, and came pretty close to killing himself. McDonalds denies any cause-effect relation, but after this film it discontinued its ""super size"" option. The humor in this film makes it an excellent vehicle to communicate to kids, but also adults, the serious consequences of our junk food epidemic. In the end, Spurlock survives his experiment, and his vegan girl friend, who had complained that even their sex life suffered, restores him to culinary sanity.",N/A

Nor do I believe that Anderson intended it as such. The plot dynamics he has put in place clearly suggest that his script represents an entirely new mythology for both creatures. I think, for the most part, Anderson was attempting to kick-start a brand new franchise with this project. That belief falls into why I was able to appreciate his approach to the overall material. It was easier for me, with that knowledge, to avoid the temptation of comparing what I saw to the other films that came before. Aside from the plot holes everybody complains about, I give Anderson credit for adapting a fresh take on these time-worn monsters.All this notwithstanding, I do feel obligated to take issue with FOX for two-timing me, one of their many loyal consumers, with this blatant ""unrated"" Director's Cut. Yes, the two-disc package is very appealing. You get nine minutes of extra footage, digitally enhanced ""gore,"" and an admittedly cool ""Alien vs. Predator"" comic book! My main question would ultimately have to entail why this wasn't the DVD FOX initially released. Money may indeed make the world go around, as we've all been told. But, why do so many distributors feel the need to double-dip on certain titles? That makes no sense to me now and probably never will for as long as I live.But please don't let this minor quibble detract you from your decision to experience this film for yourself, especially if you've never seen it. Regardless of what you might have heard, this is not a totally unredeemable crud-fest. It is a suitably entertaining and altogether fun escape from reality. That is what I have always maintained movies of this nature should be about. I say give it a chance.",AVP: Alien vs. Predator
649388,"For those that are looking for a feel good bubblegum movie and for those that are nostlagic over the 80's music, Music & Lyrics fits the bill! From the Director who brought us Miss Congeniality, we know too well that it's not an Oscar contender but a good piece of entertainment that wouldn't insult the general public as Dixie Chicks did to its main audience.  Drew Barrymore & Hugh Grant are so likeable and they have great onscreen chemistry. Their uncanny timing in delivery of their goofy and self-depreciating selves is seamless that it makes this two-dimensional movie larger than sums of its parts.  The story premise is very simple, a had-been 80's pop singer akin to Duran Duran is desperate to write a hit song for the modern day Britney Spears &/or Christina Aguilera. That would enable him to resurrect his singing career which at best is doing circuits at amusement parks and reunion parties.  He's good with melody but without his former member who's good with lyrics, he wouldn't be able to fulfill his aim. That's when serenpendity strikes in the form of a water girl for his plants in his apartment.  Watch out for scene stealers from Hugh's character's manager, Raymond's brother from Everyone Loves Raymond, and the lady from Third Rock from the Sun as Drew's character's sister.  Yes, it's a kitsch and predictable movie but who cares when we have so much fun?  Commendable watching",Music and Lyrics
723875,"This movie asks the question: ""Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?"" David (Jerry O'Connell) finds himself under increasing pressure to take the final plunge with his long time girlfriend (Bridgitte Wilson) after his best buddy Tyler becomes engaged. This news wreacks havoc on David's life as he tries to find the answer to the question the movie asks.This movie is funny, very funny at times and also at times quite stupid, but it is good quality entertainment nonetheless. Ryan Reynolds steals the show unsurprisingly, as Mike, a freind to David and Tyler who is trying to figure out his own problems where he fits in in the world. A scene where he wakes up in a strangers bed after a hugely intoxicating night is absolutely hillarious...I bought this movie because I am a fan of the young cast, especially Reynolds and also because it is directed by Walt Becker, the same guy who gave us Van Wilder. Fans of that movie will love this, as will all fans of Reynolds and Jerry O'Connell. Anyone else may find it to be 'not their kinda movie'.",N/A
441887,"I saw this as a memento to childhood delight, as I vividly recall seeing it with my best pal when it came out.  There are wonderful images in it, of the greasy, mysteriously menacing plants striking blind beauties while society falls apart around them.Of course, if your standard is not to re-live a wonderful time as a child in a cinema of screaming and laughing children, this film will probably do very little for you.  Viewed more cooly from my vantage as a middle-aged film buff, it is pretty weak as sci-fi.  Little is explained - the meteors somehow cause both blindness and a bizarre transformation in the triffids - and after the chaos of a society falling apart, the plot takes weird twists.  One group that the narrative follows forms a kind of family and inexplicably heads to southern europe, where after much danger they escape.  The other actors are a troubled couple of scientists, who miraculously discover that salt water dissolves the triffids after much failed study, again inexplicably.  And the effects!

1042918,"This is one of those movies series that when I think about they remind me of all the saturdays in middle school where I would stay up till 4am watching all the old movies my parents and much-older siblings had laying around in our movie collection.'Revenge of the Nerds' is the perfect middle-school/high-school movie in every since of the phrase.  It is cheap/slackstick/sexual humor, but unlike a lot of newer movies along the same lines ('American Pie,' 'Eurotrip,' 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin') it never feel gratuitous, eventhough the language is much more questionable.  The plot itself follows two best-friend nerds durring their fall semester of their freshman year.  When they are kicked out of the dorms, they along with fellow 'outcasts' band together and start their own fraturnity and cause problems for their fellow Fraturnity full of Jocks.The Second movies features almost all of the entire original cast (Anthony Edwards only appears in the first 3-minutes of the film), as they take a trip down the Miami for a natual 'Fraturnity Leadership Meeting' and of course chaos insues.The third film takes place a good 10/15 years after the events of the second movie, and thus has a completly different tone than the previous two.  This movie was original made-for-TV so already from the beginning the humor is more slapstick (and much less sexual), and its dare-I-say almost 'family freiendly'.  In the movie Louis' nephue moves off to college to find the college overrun with Nerds, but the Dean trying to get rid of them all.The Fourth (and final film) I have only viewed once, but it is another 'made-for-tv' movie that follows the surviving nerds (now in their late 30s/early 40s) getting married and starting their families.",N/A
1025642,"I actually liked this sequel better after a couple of viewings.  It did not really grab me the first time around, and my wife thought that it relied too much on slapstick (like the silly food fight). Some of the songs are pretty good but, overall, it is not on the same level as movies like Brother Bear.Now for the reaction of the audience that really counts in our household: our three-year old likes it a lot; the two-year old was so-so on Cinderella III at first, but now, like me, she enjoys it as well.The story line is adequately described elsewhere, so I see no need to repeat it, nor do I see the need to explain how I think it could have been done better. (But if you want to see an excellent non-animated version of the Cinderella story, check out ""Ever After - A Cinderella Story"" with Drew Barrymore. In ""Ever After"" you get an even deeper sense of the great injustice done to Cinderella by the evil stepmom.)Perhaps Cinderella III merits 4 stars for its entertainment value and, while that is basically all that these movies are about--entertainment, I just didn't think it was quite 4 stars, and I reserve 5 stars for movies, even animated ones, that also contain a meaningful message. Sure, Cinderella has a little more spunk in this sequel, but all she is fighting for is to get married to her true love (someone who she actually knows very little about). She is not fighting for any moral principle that I would like my daughters to recognize and repect.[Added notes: (1) While I fully respect their opinion, I disagree rather strongly with those reviewers who see Cinderella in the original version as a placid character who generates little emotional interest for the viewer. Think about her situation: after her father's death, she was made a servant in her own home(!) and she is completely under the control of the evil stepmom. To whom could she turn for help? No one.  And yet, she faced each day with spirit and renewed hope, and she responded with emotions appropriate to the abuse that was heaped upon her. Again, if you do not know children who have had to endure abusive home environments, count yourself lucky and just watch ""Cinderella - Ever After"" to get a glimpse at what life must have been like for Cinderella.2) All of these movie reviews are simply someone's opinion, and I find them all helpful. Whether the reviewer says ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"", the comments give me a feel for the movie. From the high number of ""not helpful's"" given to a lot of the reviews that rate Cinderella III and similar movies less than stellar, I am left to wonder if the raters are simply expressing their disagreement with the review's opinion.]",Cinderella III - A Twist in Time

1090751,"""Civic Duty"" exploits the paranoia of post-9/11 America to create a timely, suspenseful, and critical thriller about the fear of terrorists in our midst. Terry Allen (Peter Krause) is short-tempered and insecure after losing his accountant job just as he and wife Marla (Kari Matchett) were looking forward to buying a house. Left with little to do beside send out resumes and watch television reports of the growing menace of Islamic terrorists, Terry begins to see something furtive in the  activities of his new neighbor Gabe Hassan (Khaled Abol Naga), a Muslim graduate student.Much of ""Civic Duty""'s success, both as suspense and as metaphor for America's socio-political obsession, relies on the credibility of Peter Krause's performance. Insecurity and idleness turn Terry into a paranoid bully. He's irrational, but that doesn't mean that he's wrong. Director Jeff Renfroe keeps us guessing. Has Terry stumbled upon something sinister in spite of himself? Is Hassan a terrorist, completely innocent, or perhaps a criminal of a more mundane nature? Regardless, Terry's belief that someone is out to get him is insular and self-destructive. A theatrical trailer is the only bonus feature on the Red Envelope 2007 DVD.",Civic Duty

He is too absorbed in his own concerns to provide these students with the instruction they deserve.  At one point, he claims that his problems stem from the state of the world, so George w. is too blame for his problems to some extent, but mostly its just his own inability to deal with life.

For those looking for a comedy, there's lots of laughs, including some humor that's over the top (at least in the unrated version).  It's also a great ""coming of age"" movie for post-adolescents, a sort of bildungsroman for adults.  Because of its adult themes and constant demonstration of drug use, it's not a movie to take the kids to see, but if you're in your twenties or thirties, it's perfect.One part of the movie puzzled me at first: the scenes where Alison Scott decides to keep the baby instead of having an abortion.  Looked at one way, it's totally logical for an irreligious person as Ms Scott appears to be to have an abortion rather than risk her career and her chance at having a family more of her choosing.  The first time I saw the movie, I thought it wasn't being honest on this point.  When I saw it the second time, however, I came to a different conclusion.  Judd Apatow (the writer) went as far as he could in a mainstream movie to say that abortion for convenience is wrong.  What captured this sentiment was Ms Scott's conversation with her mother, where her mom, a product of the Sixties no doubt, blithely states that an acquaintance, after having an abortion, later got married ""and now she has a real baby.""In short: it's an entertaining, light-hearted and sometimes thought-provoking movie.",Knocked Up
246548,"I'm not your stereotypical guy. I don't drink, I don't watch football, I don't chase girls, and I certainly don't work out. I also don't like a lot of action movies- I mean, they can be fun, but there's only so many times I can watch some muscle bound uber man fire a machine gun while spewing out a string of four-letter words in the middle of a room where everything is exploding for some reason. It gets a bit old.But Die Hard (along with a few other action flicks) is an exception. A huge exception. See, here's the thing; this movie rules. Few things get my testosterone surging as much as watching Bruce Willis take out an entire room of angry terrorists, or crawling through a ventilator shaft using wisecracks to vent his barely contained man-rage. Because when you get right down to it, Bruce is the freaking MAN. I mean, seriously, I practically grow an extra Y chromosome every time I watch him.  Remember all those Chuck Norris jokes that were popular a couple years ago? Bruce Willis has done all of that. Six times.In all seriousness, Willis' performance is truly fantastic, nervy flurry of raw, unadorned masculinity. His character, John McClane, is one of the great tough-guy action heroes, thanks to his sharp one-liners (of course they're groaners, but in a good way), way-cool fightin' skills, and feral intelligence. Alan Rickman is also fantastic as the film's slick, coldly detached, and deliciously evil main villain, Hans Gruber. Throw in a loveable sidekick (Al Powell, who isn't nearly as one-dimensional as the ""loveable sidekick"" label might make him seem, played wonderfully by Reginald VelJohnson) and a love interest who manages to be waaaaaaaay more than your typical damsel in distress (kudos to actress Bonnie Bedelia, who pulls of the role of McClane's estranged wife with plenty of intelligence and panache), and you've got yourself an exciting, engaging, blood-pumping action classic.",N/A

1103273,"Die Hard is considered by many film buffs as the greatest action movie ever made. There is just something about the character of John McClane that attracts movie goers. Is it his spunky attitude or is it the fact that he is known for having really bad days? It's both. There have been action franchises that have run out of steam in the past, but all three Die Hard films were great fun. Usually I'm not a fan of dipping into the well one too many times, but if Batman Begins and Casino Royale were able to re-spark the magic then why not give Die Hard another go?Live Free Or Die Hard takes an old fashioned cop and throws him out of his element, which leaves room for a supporting character. Justin Long steps in as McClane's frazzled and tech wizard sidekick. Timothy Olyphant plays a cyber terrorist who decides to shutdown the entire nation in order to systematically collect hundreds of millions of bank account numbers in order to show the government that the system can in fact be broken. Now it's up to John McClane and his sidekick Matthew Farrell to save the day.What follows is high octane action that one expects from a Die Hard movie. An important thing to point out is how director Len Wiseman stayed true to the Die Hard style and kept CGI to a minimum. Die Hard movies were great because they did action using real stunts and real explosions. The one thing I was afraid of was that this new Die Hard would go with the trend and use CGI as a crutch when in fact it used it as a tool. There are plenty of stunts that are real sets and real explosions. A few scenes fallback on CGI, but only because doing them for real just wouldn't work. Bruce Willis also keeps the spunk that is John McClane. You'll laugh at the one-liners and the witty remarks that Willis adds in the tensest situations and of course Justin Long is just great with sarcasm. They make a great on-screen duo. I also think that the humor in the Die Hard series is what makes it such a great action series. It's the fact that the filmmakers realize they are making an action movie; a movie in which nothing could ever happen in real life. Lots of action movies take themselves too seriously and they become laughably bad, but Live Free Or Die Hard keeps that spunk that makes it laughably enjoyable. Don't get me wrong though; there are some amazing action scenes that will make you tense up. This is by no means a comedy. The elevator shaft scene was one that stood out and reminded me of the trailer hanging off the cliff in Spielberg's The Lost World.Moving onto the score this brings up Marco Beltrami. I can state here that I am not a Marco Beltrami fan. The only score of his that I liked was his score to The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada. I always feel like he never does anything thematic at all and which is why I was worried when he was selected to fill Michael Kamen's shoes. Michael Kamen was the composer of the first three Die Hard films, but sadly he passed away in 2003. He was a greatly respected composer and his work on the first three Die Hards were iconic. Thankfully Marco Beltrami rose to the occasion and did a wonderful tribute with his score to Live Free Or Die Hard. He touches on some themes that Kamen wrote and gives it that Die Hard feel and atmosphere.Overall this movie was great. I had a great time watching it and felt like it was better than most of the high budget stuff I've seen this summer so far. Sometimes we need to go back to the basics to remind us why we love what we love. The reason why we love action movies is because of Die Hard and it was great fun seeing McClane back in action.",N/A

The film is set in countryside of Thailand in 1920s and our hero dressed like a cowboy is looking for the murderer responsible for the deaths of his parents while taking away buffalos from the rich (after fighting the ""bad"" cow keepers) and giving them to the poor. The story is confusing and jokes often misfire, but probably you would not care much.First this is not ""Ong-Bak"" where no CGI is used. ""Dynamite Warrior"" uses plenty of them during the action scenes, but this is only necessary because of the nature of the weapons the protagonist uses against the villains (please see below). Fortunately Dan Chupong can do action stunts and some of them are impressive, but the film and its repetitive actions obviously need more time to let him show what he really can do. This is regrettable for Panna Rittikrai, who plays the arch-villain in this film, is actually stunt coordinator of ""Ong-Bak."" Dan Chupong is one of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s and hence the importance of the final battle scene, but the film takes too much time to go there.The daredevil hero uses one unique weapon - huge firecrackers (not exactly dynamites as the title says). Dan Chupong's hero even rides one like surfing, which is quite silly but funny, but this idea does not develop much. Like many other visual tricks and martial arts stunts in ""Dynamite Warrior,"" director seems content with using his ideas repeatedly in simplest way.

The first two seasons of Arrested Development was the funniest stuff I ever saw on American television. But this third season was simply not the same program. Never has the change of a show's writers been more abjectly evident in the quality of humor.Some of the previous reviewers have pointed this out, but the over-whelming majority of those who have been writing here have used this as a soapbox to castigate Fox for cancelling the show. On one level, that's understandable, but I've found very few reviewers willing to admit that Season 3 just isn't that funny.There seemed to be an emphasis on being ""clever"" rather than laugh-out-loud funny. I found the incessant, non-stop sexual innuendo/double entendre -- usually of the homoerotic variety -- to be a lame subsitute for actual humor. Were we really expected to burst into laughter at that stuff? It was like watching a ""Worst Of"" SNL special.The ""Call back"" technique -- where actions, dialogue, etc, of previous episodes is referenced again -- was way overdone. Again, if it had been written in such a way that it was funny, it would have been different. But using call-back just for the sake of doing it is pointless.There were some laughs -- the Tiny Town episode was probably the best. But by the second disc of this two-disc set, I knew I was watching just to complete the series. It wasn't funny any more and I could watch an entire episode with a straight face; impossible in the first two seasons.The writers and producers of this show would have better served us by keeping the quality at the same earlier level rather than doing whatever they did that produced this embarrassing third season.

This show is the true heir to Arrested Development's vacated throne; yet, unfortunately and unsurprisingly, Universal has given it a boxset worthy of its meagre ratings (around 6 million/year).  The commentaries (which are mostly dry solo affairs--no fun cast commentaries as on the AD sets) are not presented with their respective episodes but rather cordoned off onto the skimpy extras disc in order to justify the two-volume version of same (created for casual fans of a show without casual fans).  The original pilot that the TV critics watched with Rachel Dratch is not included.  It's also the little things:  The first and third cases have the same cover as the box, yet there is a different cast photo collage on the second case, which should have been on the third (extras) case instead (if my design sensibility is correct).  That same photo collage is used on all the menus, including disc 2, which has the other cast collage on the cover.  For the discs themselves, they merely ported the individual picture of each of the principals from, again, that same photo collage, onto each disc.

The killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail...Using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself... The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise...The film is one of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger's best...Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism...",N/A

935792,"This Russian road movie finds a father and 11-year-old son traveling hundreds of miles on foot from Moscow to a village on the Black Sea. The pace is slow and hypnotic; the situation is unpromising. They are out of money and the season is turning gradually toward winter. The storyline itself is elliptical and relies little if it at all on exposition. We simply watch as the two trudge onward, under leaden skies and across rain-swept distances, depending on the kindness of strangers. The boy, worldly wise beyond his years and distrusting his father, dreams of flight and wind sailing. He has a mysterious sort of second sight that permits him to see himself and his surroundings from high above. Meanwhile, earthbound, the camera follows the two of them across endless sodden, forlorn landscapes.The people they meet along the way are often little better off than they are, living in a kind of defeated ennui, making do, getting by, lonely, and often sustained by alcohol. One man offers them shelter and a roofing job on a house that seems to be abandoned and falling down. When a more generous householder makes the boy even more impatient to reach their destination, the father's unwillingness to press on precipitates a final crisis. Finally, the movie is a long, melancholy but lyrically told story, with fine performances, about life journeys and the contrast between youthful dreams and desperate realities.",Roads to Koktebel

In fact the movie was immediatly cut almost as soon as it was first shown and especially when it came to the United States. The basic story was the same but we lose so much as far as getting to know the characters better among various differnt subplots going on along with the main story.Unfortunatly for us all much of the original footage which was cut from the original screening is lost or beyond repair. However, a great deal of the scenes were in fact found, restored, and reintroduced into the flim for the first time since it's premiere in Berlin. Scenes which were either still missing or beyone repair were still used either by using stills or by text explaining the scene. Along with this beautifly restored picture we are given the orginal soundtrack used during it's premiere.The making of special feature was a welcomed suprise as we are told of the painstaking efforts by the crew in Germany to bring this most influential of all the German impressionist films.

Nevertheless, the Iron Giant himself stands as moral crusader in the face of blood-thristy government representatives who think one can just shoot at a problem and it will either go away or won't shoot back.This movie does for American animation what Hayao Miyazaki did for Japanese - transcended age, genre, and form to establish animation as a viable medium through which to convey deep philosophical truths.

647277,"Guillermo del Toro knew there is a huge audience for movies that emphasize flash-bang wizardry over substance. He knew he was making a fantasy film with fauns and fairies and secret underground kingdoms, featuring a twelve year old girl as the central character. He knew lots of Americans hate reading so much they wouldn't think about going to a film with subtitles, even though he directed the well-made English language ""Hellboy"". He knew the amount and intensity of the violence of this film would make it unsuitable for children. Yet he made the film anyway - and thank goodness he did.I see many reviews here complaining that this absolute fantastic movie is ""boring"" and they had to ""read for two hours"". Oh my! Pity the poor audience, forced against their will to, dare I say it? Read. So - if you aren't a Spanish speaker and don't want to ""read"" for two hours, keep on moving.In fact - if you don't want to see a movie filled with thrilling adventure, stunning visuals, evil fascist villains, brave female heroines and beautiful photography with sharp editing - stay far, far away.You still there? Maybe El Laberinto del Fauno is for you. I join the large number of positive reviewers standing in line to sing this film's praises. Yes, Ivana Baquero is an amazing child actor. Not yet a teenager, she reminds me of the sixteen year old Jennifer Connelly in ""Labyrinth"" twenty years ago. The resemblance of the two young actresses and the name ""Labyrinth"" aren't the only similarities. Both films are fantasies featuring young women who must complete a ""quest"" to save their baby brother. But the newer film is superior in every way, for the appropriate audience. Where Labyrinth featured Connelly interacting with David Bowie and an army of Muppets, El Laberinto has young Ivana moving back and forth between an underworld of fairies and fauns and her ""real world"" of Spanish Fascists. The real world elements of the story make you care very deeply about what happens to young Ofelia and her mother and baby brother.Ofelia's father has been killed in the Spanish Civil War and her desperate mother marries the cruel Vidal, played by Sergi L&oacute;pez, one of Franco's captains, who (as has been written repeatedly) joins the screen's pre-eminent villains. He is cold and cruel to his own family and soldiers. To his enemies, he is far worse. Maribel Verd&uacute;, previously wonderful in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", is strong and compassionate as Mercedes, a servant of the cruel Vidal, but also the sister of one of the Republican Spanish freedom fighters the Captain has been dispatched to snuff out. Ariadna Gil is tragically noble as Ofelia's mother, Carmen. She has married to provide for her family but, realistically, she would like for things to ""work out"" between the Captain and the rest of the family. Gil's work here reminds me of Allison Janney's in ""American Beauty"" as a wife beaten down by life with a domineering military man. &Aacute;lex Angulo reminds me of a Spanish Paul Giamatti as a kind Doctor who has been conscripted onto the evil Captain's staff, but like Mercedes, is secretly helping the freedom fighters with his life continuously at risk. Doug Jones gives two of the most memorable performances in the film under heavy makeup as the titular Faun Pan and as the horrible ""Pale Man"" a flesh-eating beast that Ofelia must retrieve a magic dagger from.My only regret watching this film is my own limitation at not understanding Espanol. I would imagine that this fantastically rich film is even more delicious in its native language.",Pan's Labyrinth

1035266,"A shocking, thoroughly irregular, well-made film that fully exhibits the ravages of evangelical practice in America, cultic obsession embodied in a well-strategized assault on the spiritual innocence of children that is so abusive it begs the question ""is this actually happening in America?"" Absolutely unfathomable. As one evangelical mother says in the film ""there are two kinds of people in this world - those who love Jesus and those who don't"". Sound familiar? With us or against us. Yes, Haggard is creepsville (and hilarious, given his recent delicate revelations), and the scene with the children raising en masse a Reich arm of ""blessing"" toward a large cardboard statue of Bush is pure Orwellian theatre that chills to the bone. These poor children already lost to the madness of a few, the manipulation of their innocent emotional lives, their spontaneous weeping and gushing in the face of fevered verbal onslaught by the ""leaders"", the idiotic terror of glossolalia, the threats and coercion, and a palette of concoctions of death and dishonor that wait upon each child's next breath like a living demon - these things are intolerable. But truly scabrous is Becky Fisher, vicious ""leader"" of the camp, Children's Ministry expert (!), in the grip of mental illness, no one supervising her interior fantasy life, and certainly no one safeguarding the children on whom she visits huge wicked things. A big fat woman, she preaches how no child these days is willing to fast for God. There are a number of moments in the film that are laugh out loud, but the sorrow of its content, honestly, is a wound difficult to bear. To live in a nation that acquiesces to this kind of ignorance is burdensome; necessary, no doubt, as antidote, but a true sorrow for anyone with heart for the America we knew. Jesus Camp spotlights an American taliban tribe on the march, delusional warrior dogs at fever-pitch, crazy-eyed - possessed, really. Yes, everything for God except love. A tragedy in one act.

263038,"Well, it took me a good ten years, but I finally finished watching this movie. I have owned it in various avatars, but everytime I used to start ""Cleopatra"", I would lose it by the half hour mark, and would be fast asleep around the forty-five minute mark. This has happened at LEAST five times that I can remember.This is not a bad movie, but you will HAVE to invest yourself in it for the first hour if you really want to finish it. It doesn't quite grab you as other historical films from the genre (if you like 'The Ten Commandments' and 'The Bible', this movie isn't as light watching as those are). I also initially had a problem with Elizabeth Taylor. In some scenes it really looked like she spent the night out drinking WAY too much alcohol, and she tried using loads of make up to cover the damage. I don't know - she didn't work for me at least 50% of the time.Yes, if you use all the politically correct definitions under which Hollywood functions, this is a 'classic' in every sense of the word. After watching this, you should revisit the made-for-TV movie 'Cleopatra', starring Billy Zane and Leonor Varela. You judge, and tell me which is the better film. I could finish the latter in one sitting.I think the problem is that the script here is very slow, and Eliza's Cleopatra isn't very alluring - its quite hard to care for a creature such as her, and she came across as rather vampish and trashy at times. I doubt the real Cleopatra was like this, but what do I know. I'm no historian.Everyone has very polarized views on this movie decades after its' release. It took me years to watch it to the end. Was it worth it? Yes, I think so. Its a passably good film with lots of costumes and fanfare, but to me it lacked what makes a 'true' classic - and thats soul. Just my two cents.",N/A

282186,"Costner stars as Earl Brooks, founder of a prosperous Portland, Ore., box factory and all-around pillar of the community. He's an uptight, doting dad with a weird aversion to contractions and a fondness for bow ties. Our first glimpse of Earl comes when he's getting ready to receive a Man of the Year award for his extensive philanthropy work. But something seems a bit off straight away, as Costner's huddled in the bathroom chanting the Serenity Prayer while William Hurt is lurking over his shoulder, making all sorts of lurid insinuations.It turns out Earl is a bit of an addict, and though he's been going to plenty of meetings, tonight he's fired up and ready for a relapse. The only catch is instead of booze or gambling, our Mr. Brooks happens to be hooked on murder. Yes, this humble aw-shucks Oregon businessman secretly doubles as the notorious ""Thumbprint Killer""--a local legend who grooves on shooting couples midcoitus, and then arranging their corpses in erotic tableaux while twirling his arms and groaning in orgasmic fits of glee. (Seriously.) Also, Hurt isn't real. He's a black-clad manifestation of Earl's sinister subconscious, and the two actors often have lengthy discussions through mirrors and other reflective surfaces. So if you were ever wondering what might've happened if Jiminy Cricket was played by that whack job from A History of Violence, here's your answer.Earl's latest slip-up just so happens to be caught on camera by a jittery pervert amateur photographer, played here (in a stroke of casting genius) by jittery pervert amateur comedian Dane Cook. Instead of heading straight to the cops with the evidence, Cook's overenergetic shutterbug goes the blackmail route, demanding a voyeuristic ride-along during Costner's next ritual execution. We dare you to find a single line delivered by Cook that isn't riddled with some sort of manic hambone affectation, just like his alleged comedy routines. In fact, the best gag comes from Mr. Brooks pitting Cook's frenetic, exhausting mugging against Costner's laid-back socio-pathy and Hurt's wry malignancy. If anything, this movie seems designed to prove the strange, unseemly notion that even bloodthirsty serial killers are more enjoyable company than bad MySpace comedians. Or as Hurt puts it when sizing up Cook: ""Even if he was funny and charming, I still wouldn't like him.""Meanwhile, (in a so-bad-it's-good story line), police detective Tracy Atwood (a hilarious, haggard Demi Moore, Botoxed beyond recognition ) is obsessively following Earl's bloody trail while dealing with (a) the fallout of her divorce from a smarmy playboy (Jason Lewis ), (b) an escaped killer (Matt Schulze ) who wants revenge, and (c) the burden of being an independently wealthy civil servant. Any one of these would suffice for its own movie, but our Tracy's a multitasker. Indeed, Moore is so grimly purposeful that it's hard not to get the giggles. The older she gets, the more the actress reminds us of a late-period Joan Crawford : same rigid face and bulldog ferocity, same air of lunatic conviction. Whatever movie Moore's in, or thinks she's in, she's the queen bee.If all that's not enough, the youngest baby Brooks (Danielle Panabaker) has just dropped out of college after a coed was murdered with a hatchet, and Daddy's starting to wonder about what just might run in the family.Mr. Brooks goes berserk -- quite spectacularly so -- in a bizarre pigpile of clashing plotlines and camp-classic set pieces. We could lie and pretend we weren't riveted, but there's something strangely invigorating about watching a movie where you can simply throw back your arms and surrender, understanding you have no idea what the hell is going to happen next because the screenwriters are obviously on hallucinogens.",Mr. Brooks
1032242,"This is an excellent gothic thriller based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, Eisenheim The Illusionist, set in late 19th century Vienna about the son of a young cabinetmaker who falls in love with a young Viennese aristocrat and is banned from seeing her as he is a basic commoner. As the legend goes about the young lad, he meets a travelling magician on the road who shows him the secrets of illusion, where he sets off to exotic lands to learn the mysteries of life. He returns to Vienna after his travels and opens a show in the great city to astonish not only Vienna's common public with his quasi supernatural illusions, but also Crown Prince Rudolf, son of Emperor Franz Josef who then reigned over the Austrian Hungarian Empire.Originally the short story was written as a political criticism of the Monarchy, based on the scandalous incident, where the bodies of Rudolf and his mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera were found shot in a Royal hunting lodge, apparently a murder suicide which the Royal family kept from the public for many years.Edward Norton as Eisenheim is understated and brilliant, as the many sleight of hand tricks in the film were actually done by the gifted actor. Norton must have practiced for months to reveal such confidence and skill needed for these types of trick. However, Norton's character portrayed a perfect man of mystery, begging the question, are these mere illusions or does Eisenheim possess supernatural power, controlling matter, energy, space and time itself.The special effects in this film are well done. My favourite illusion in the film, (and they're many) is the Excalibur Sword illusion where Eisenheim borrows Rudolf's sword, somehow magnetizes it to the stage standing straight up, asking the various aristocrats' in the audience to release it from its position. Of course none can release the sword, as they, like the Arthur legend, are not meant to be king. When Prince Rudolf attempts to pull the sword from its stationary stance, he finally does so with great effort; by causing the ruthless Prince some embarrassment, Eisenheim is now a targeted enemy of the Crown.Paul Giamatti as the corrupt Inspector Uhl really shows what a versatile and gifted actor he really is, able to do comedy, tragedy, fantasy...a very impressive performance.The overall look of the film had the atmosphere as if we are viewing a primary historical source, the director using 80 year old editing techniques etc., this was unusual but effective for such a mixed genre film - fantasy, thriller, supernatural thriller and fairy tale romance.When first seeing this film I was spellbound and the ending, a perfect twist, making The Illusionist a perfect example of skilful storytelling.This is an excellent film.",N/A
969174,"Director Roger Kumble can't stop thinking about relationships.  First he gives us Cruel Intentions 1 & 2, then the Sweetest Thing, and now we have Just Friends, another movie about relationships gone awry.  If the first two films were about manipulating people for sex and the second was about manipulating them for love, this latest flick could be safely called a little of both.Penned by Adam ""Tex"" Davis (this is the first thing he's written for the screen, unless you count the Made-For-TV ""Spring Break Lawyer,"" which, uh, I don't), ""Just Friends"" is certainly having fun with itself, but it doesn't always have fun with the audience.  Poor Chris, a fat-but-loveable high school loser, professes his love for his best friend, Jamie, only to have her turn him down with a platonic kiss, planted firmly in that ""like a brother"" area located in the middle of his chubby cheek.  Ten years later, Chris has slimed down and toned up and now pursues and discards women with a personality that is as chiseled as his body.  Working as a sly music executive, he finds himself accidentally stranded in his native New Jersey (thanks to a jet plane/microwave mishap) with another chance to win the heart (or at least the body) of his long-lost childhood chum.Chris is played expertly by Ryan Reynolds doing what he does best: mixing wry attitude with well-acted emotion (his best scenes are when he's encased in rubber as the once-flabby Chris; Reynolds would do well to take more character roles, since he's starting to pigeonhole himself as The Witty Wiseacre).  Reynolds is surrounded by a group of equally able co-stars who are strong in each of their roles: Amy Smart as the trophy gal, Jamie; the wonderfully over-the-top Anna Faris as a Christina Aguilera wanna-be named Samantha James; and Chris Klein (who seems to be making fun of every other dull-as-dirt character he's ever played) as the doe-eyed rival, Dusty Dinkleman.  There are other notables here, too, including Stephen Root (Newsradio, Dodgeball) as Chris's boss and Julie Hagerty (Airplane!) as Chris's ditzy mother.Ms. Hagerty's presence makes a lot of sense, especially since this film borrows heavily from a lot of its comedic ancestors, which not only include Zucker and Abrahams, but also the Three Stooges (see: Chris's slap-heavy relationship with his younger brother -- the only thing that's missing there are ""nyuks"" and eye pokes) and the National Lampoon's series (see: the various pratfalls and even a humorously obliterated Christmas panorama).A lot of this is remarkably well done and truly funny stuff (for those fans of the style), but it also seems crammed together in a clumsy attempt to distract from the shallow and confused script.  You don't ask much from a movie like this, but you do expect a little heart, a little warmth, or -- more importantly -- a little sense.  Unfortunately, not much of this movie seems very relatable or plausible, which wouldn't be so bad if the film didn't pretend so hard that it was both.  As a result, Chris's pursuit of Jamie, although it is the main premise, actually feels tacked on, and both characters, in spite of their believability as real people, are still very hard to understand and connect with.Your best bet, if you watch this film, is just to watch it.  People get electrocuted, dropped off balconies, and very few groins are spared.  Reynolds hams it up, mugs with panache, and takes all of the abuse with classy straight-man style.  Even the final credits roll over a souped-up version of Samantha James' song, ""Forgiveness,"" a pretty funny send-up of bubble-gum pop (""To forgive is divine/so let's have a glass of wine/and have make-up sex/until the end of time"").  Ultimately, if you can remove yourself from the movie as much as it removes itself from you, you'll probably enjoy the experience.(This DVD comes with the usual voice-over commentary -- which is actually pretty banal considering the subject matter, some deleted scenes, a lot of stuff about the making-of -- including Ryan's transformation into a fat high school kid, a set of blooper clips -- always a favorite, and an alternate ending that is obviously alternate for a reason.  A good collection for those of you who like a lot of bonus material.  NOTE: some sites say that there are Easter Eggs on this disc, but I haven't found them.)",N/A

Jim Carrey was perfect as Bruce, the person who God chose to take over, basically to teach him a lesson. I never got around to reviewing it but had I done so I would have rated it at 4 stars.So what made ""Evan Almighty"" Better? The biggest difference here is that the film was more central plot driven. With Bruce you got a series of scenarios based aroung the main theme. Here you have a strong central plot with a couple of sub-plots that all merge at the end. Evan, Played outstandingly by Steve Carell (The 40-Year-Old Virgin (Rated Widescreen Edition)) is a newly elected congressman who when running for office promised to ""CHANGE THE WORLD."" On the night before his first day in office he kneels down to pray for the first time in what must have been many years, asking God to help him. God's answer, of course, is to appear the next day and ask him to build an Ark, as in Noah and the flood. Evan of course fights this concept until he basically has no choice but to believe and begins to build. This of couse freaks out his family not to mention his Congressional staff and fellow congressmen. To go further into the plot would spoil many of the great surprises.Along the way we are treated to hysterical sight gags, some slapstick, and some very emotional scenes as the supporting characters all come to terms with what Evan is doing. The cast is outstanding. Morgan Freeman is great in his reprisal of God. Lauren GrahamGilmore Girls - The Complete First Five Seasonsis perfect as Evan's wife. Other co-stars include John Goodman as the evil Congressman and John Michael Higgins, Wanda Styles, and Jonah Hill as the congressional staff.Please do not hesitate to go see this.

The first chapter is good, but too much about some poet. Who cares about ancient poetry, I want more blood and guts stories. Another great story is of a General named Germanicus. He was like JFK.

874086,"The idea of a plus-size yoga workout is great, but this doesn't fulfill that need.  Megan is likeable and a good instructor.  But, and this is a big but. . . You have to watch a separate dvd extra to get the modifications--they aren't incorporated into the routine itself, which pretty much defeats the purpose.  You have to memorize the modifications and then remember them during the routine, which makes it harder to focus on the poses.  A second person doing the modifications during the routine itself would've made it much better, as the modifications are actually helpful and make uncomfortable poses more comfortable.  The routine itself is really basic and short--just 6 poses and it felt a little rushed (she says to hold poses for 5 deep breathes, and I barely got 2-3 deep breathes before she moved on).If you're a complete couch potato, this DVD would a good place to start. It's nice to see someone who's not anorexic enjoying movement.  I hope Megan does another DVD soon, one that's more challenging and incorporates the plus-size modifications into the routine itself.",Yoga: Just My Size With Megan Garcia

572028,"First of all, this movie is still hysterical.  It is a work of art.  Although Marilyn got top billing, she's clearly out-performed by both Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable.Let me, for a brief moment talk about the ""Diamond Collection"" version of How To Marry A Millionaire.  When you think of remastering, especially older films made on Cineascope or Technicolor, you think of rich, vibrant-colored stories in particular the Rogers and Hammerstein collection.  Excellent.  You, especially, think of the remastered Disney Collection.  Excellent.  Both of which, were competing genres at the time Marilyn was making a name for herself.  You might even throw the remastered ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1937) in the fray.  And yet, this ""Diamond Collection"" is barely passable as a DVD version.  This isn't a distinct restoration.  The images, even in the special feature section ""Restoration Comparison"" shows how little the previous version and the film version hasn't had much improvement with this collection.  Don't get me wrong, the sound reproduction is superb, but this is comedy and a lot depends on visuals.Recently, I started to repurchase the Disney collection-- their ""Platinum 2-disc"" set.  Cinderella, Peter Pan.  And, there is a profound difference between the last version and this deluxe version.  The Sound of Music, the same thing.This isn't to say, it's not worth watching, but there's little to no improvement in picture quality.  And, that's too bad, the technology is already here and their apology for ""grainy film loss"" is no excuse for not investing in a better color transfer system.",N/A
140703,"1963's ""The Great Escape"" is Director John Sturgis' big screen adaptation of Paul Brickhill's World War II account of the biggest Allied escape attempt from a German prisoner of war camp.  The movie version features an outstanding cast, a suspense-filled storyline, and superb direction.In 1943, the German Air Force consolidated many of their ""escape artist"" POWs in a single POW compund.  If the German intent was to put all their bad eggs in one basket and watch the basket, the effect was to pool some remarkable talent for the staging of a huge escape operation.  Led by ""Big X"" as portrayed by Richard Attenborough, the POWs organize themselves to dig escape tunnels while fooling the Germans about their activities.The movie is really two stories.  The first is the struggle by the POWs to dig tunnels out of the compound under the noses of their captors.  The second is the aftermath of their breakout, as POWs flee in all directions across Germany.  Their respective fates are captured in gritty detail.The huge cast and length of the movie (almost three hours) allows the director to explore a number of individual story lines.  Among these: ""Big X"" perseveres in escape planning, knowing he faces almost certain death if captured.  A tunnel expert played by Charles Bronson struggles with claustrophobia.  A forger of escape documents played by Donald Pleasance discovers he is going blind as the escape attempt nears.  A ""scrounger"" played by James Garner comes up with innovative ways to find materials for the escape.  Perhaps the highlight of the second half of the movie is Steve MacQueen's famous run for the Swiss border on a stolen motorcycle.The DVD includes a number of special features, most notably a documentary of the making of the movie.This movie is most highly recommended as a highlight of the movie-making art and a classic thriller of the World War II genre.",N/A

1017073,"This well-budgeted film started as a stage musical, and the ultimate result is a mish-mash of artifice and naturalisim. We jump from theatrical sets to naturalistic locations, often with clever transitions or editing. Each individual scene is wonderfully mounted. Highlights include the highly stylized opening sequence depicting the origins of WW1, and the beautifully subtle Christmas Truce scene. The key dialoge is taken from historical accounts, and all the musical numbers are actual WW1 songs (""Belgium Put the Kybosh on the Kaiser"", and ""Goodbye, Goodbye"" being standouts). However beautifull this patchwork quilt of a piece may be, it doesn't hang together well. Pacing is sometimes a problem (minutes devoted to buying cotton candy on a boardwalk adds nothing to it's scene).

956731,"An original story and extremely inspired acting creates an enjoyable movie experience, but the slow pace and lack of sympathy for the characters detracts.Tom Wilkinson is great as James Manning, a London businessman who discovers that his wife (Emily Watson) has been cheating on him with a younger apathetic businessman (Rupert Everert). When a mysterious hit and run accident kills the Manning's maid's husband, James is forced to make the decision to lie to protect his unfaithful wife, or to reveal the truth.Separate Lies is a well-crafted statement on the idea of honesty, decency, and deception, and when one is perhaps more appropriate than the other. Maybe lies protect us for a while, but perhaps painful experiences lead us to acceptance and reality. Although, by the end of the film, it's a bit confusing as to which way the writer-director seems to be leaning on the subject.Tom Wilkinson and Rupert Everett deliver superb performances, but Emily Watson's seems to stumble around a bit. It may just be that her character is flaky, but a few of her acting choices are a little shaky. The only special feature on the DVD is a feature length commentary by the director.",N/A

One, a bearded smart aleck enters the hushed vehicle and proceeds to claim all Muslim children, whose names he reads from a list. As the wailing subsides and the kidnappers drive away carrying the doomed innocents, the unthinkable happens. You are moved.That's Welcome to Sarajevo in a nutshell-heartbreaking, sincere, and boldly partisan. And smartly, director Michael Winterbottom chooses a gonzo, pseudo-journalistic style that, like those living in the city, has us dodging mortar fire and rushing through the streets to witness the genocide.The movie's about putting us on the front line and making us swallow the absurdity and chaos of a country in turmoil.",Welcome to Sarajevo VHS

1102586,"So, much has been written here, so I will not delve into what has already been said.  A couple of reviewers mentioned the ""rape"" sequence that didn't make it into theatres.  Its inclusion makes for a very different film on the unrated DVD.  I saw this movie with my dad when it came to the cinema, and I was a little uncomfortable then, being that we are  huge fans of the original.  But had we seen this version together, I probably would have been cowering under my seat with embarrassment  This has Zombie's stamp all over it.  And his style has won him devotees.  I am fairly indifferent to his previous films.  But,  there are some redeeming qualities to this movie--his efforts are admirable.

1037574,"For Dan (Heath Ledger) and his girfriend Candy (Abbie Cornish), there are love and drugs and nothing else; maybe there's nothing more. ""We're junkies,"" Candy tells a housing representative. Both she and Dan have just woken from sleep and are sitting up in bed-- her admission is as naked as their bodies. Their self-awareness is more troubling than anything else in this superb, harrowing movie.The film owns up to the pleasures and consequences of tripping out. Because of this, it fuses beauty and horror. Several of the beautiful scenes are unforgettable (a kiss in a car as it drifts through a carwash; bubbles that swirl around Dan and Candy as they glide through a swimming pool's immaculate blue water).In addition to the beauty and horror, there are surprising narrative gaps and a complete absence of background detail. For better or worse, we have only Dan and Candy in their present circumstances for anchors. We feel as engulfed by their love and self-destruction as they do.Ledger is particularly good-- witness how deftly he portrays Dan's flirtatious phone call to a man whose wallet he's stolen. Geoffrey Rush plays a suave, decadent chemistry instructor with a fondness for handsome young men; his urbane energy complements and balances Dan and Candy's desperation. The film is well directed by Neil Armfield, who co-wrote the script with Luke Davies (it's based on Davies' novel of the same name). Garry Phillips delivers solid photography; Dany Cooper delivers solid editing.Will the lovers save themselves or not? That question never goes away. The film is draining, riveting, and stunning.",Candy

His wife is a teacher, and their daughter requires very expensive medical care and lots of parental attention.  The stresses of life are beginning to take a toll on them all, and our story begins when Charles misses his regular train, and finds himself without a ticket and with an empty wallet.""Picture yourself on a train in a station,With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.""Aforementioned girl turns out to be named Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston), and when she offers to pay his fare, he feels obligated to return the favor.  Something clicks between the two, and before you know it, they're showing off pictures of their kids and agreeing to meet again.  A couple of meetings later it progresses to a surreptitious assignation (that's my two big words for this review) at a seedy hotel, and all seems to be smooth sailing.""Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,Waiting to take you away.Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,And you're gone""Unfortunately, and just a bit too soon, they learn the hard way that seedy hotel door locks can't be trusted, and from here on in, Charles finds himself in deep you-know-what, as an intruder calculatedly takes him for everything he's got.  Lucinda begs him not to involve the police, even though she got the worst of the attack, so Charles tries to tackle the problem himself, with a little help from a friend.Other verses of the song hint at the predictable twist, so I won't go into those, but suffice to say, the improbable and implausible ending totally derails an otherwise entertaining movie.I'd say this one is a definite rental, especially if you're a fan of Owen or Aniston.

126689,"They sure don't make 'em like this anymore -- that much can be said for this balls-to-the-wall, over-the-top sequel to John Carpenter's classic ""Escape From New York."" In ""Escape From L.A.,"" the audience is reunited with loveable Snake Plissken, the eye-patch sporting, leather-clad war-hero made famous by Kurt Russell. Russell, together with Carpenter and his long-time collaborater, Debra Hill, wrote the script, so you can bet that not only is it a labor of love for all involved in the making of the movie, but also a fitting companion-piece to the original. If you haven't seen the original, don't fear. Like any good action sequel, this one does it's audience the favor of existing as a stand-alone feature as well.The year is 2013. The constitution has been rewritten and the president is serving his life-long term. Red meat, along with other simple pleasures such as premarital sex, alcohol and any sort of fun has been outlawed. Those who can't comply or conform with this ultra-conservative new vision of The United States are banished to Los Angeles. Doesn't sound so bad, but unfortunately and conveniently, L.A. has been isolated from the country by a devastating earthquake and transformed into a prison camp, full of the dirtiest and uncivilized criminals and low-lifes. Universal Studios has been banished to the depths of the Pacific Ocean, and you can bet this ain't the happiest place on Earth. After being captured by the government and injected with a deadly virus for motivational purposes, Snake is dispatched to this wasteland to retreive a doomsday device, hijacked by the president's daughter, which has the power to revert Earth back to the dark ages. As our hero wades through the sewers, surfs tsunamis and plays a deadly game of basketball, he encounters some colorful characters along the way, played by the likes of Steve Buscemi, Bruce Campbell, Peter Fonda and Pam Grier. If you think these characters are bold and outlandish, just get a load of the action, which takes many liberties with the human imagination and stands out from much of the disposable fluff of it's time (""Independence Day,"" for one).Since this is a John Carpenter film, you know two things: First, the music is going to be good. Composed by Carpenter himself, it's yet another classic score. Second, the movie looks gorgeous. There may be some dodgy special effects here and there, but for 1996, this is a pretty tight looking feature. It's far from a perfect film, but at the very least, it's an example of the best escapism movies have to offer. Kurt Russell is brilliant and doesn't miss a mark as Snake, and Carpenter's vision is that of confidence and bold imagination. Those who appreciate a good action flick that checks your brain at the door will find salvation in ""Escape From L.A.""",N/A

91808,"This movie is about more than just racism. Even though being from the deep South I know with certainty that a great deal of the elements in this movie are the brutal truth. However, it's more than that, it's about LOYALTY! REVENGE! JUSTICE! and a FATHER'S LOVE! for his child. It goes deeper than it being about the rape of a black girl by white guys. Don't get me wrong, that part is very prevalent to the movie. I just think that any father in his position would've done the same thing if his daughter was brutalized the way this man's little girl was. That's a father's love, and any real father will defend his own. My dad would've done the same thing without thinking twice about it. Not saying that makes it right, but I know there wasn't a dry eye in the house while Matthew McConaughey was doing his closing agruements, and describing in graphic detail what this poor child went through at the hands of these grown men. This is a hard thing for any woman to deal with anyway, but to rip innocence from a child is just plain sick and monsterous. So, Carl Lee put them down like rabid bloodthirsty cannines. Seriously, They almost ripped that poor kid apart, wrecked her from inside out, almost beat her to death and then had the nerve to be gleeful about it on their way out the courtroom. Don't get me wrong, I know it isn't anyone's place to take the law into their own hands, nor think it's o.k to kill someone just because they may feel like it. However, I do think they deserved it, and that justice was served. Frankly, instead of jail they should've given him a medal. I know this review is gonna upset a lot of people, but I gotta keep it real. It doesn't matter if the father were black, white, brown, purple, or blue he still probably would've done the same thing.

1068728,"There are already numerous Godannar reviews on amazon.com on for the individual volumes, so I'll just review the DVD release itself.Like most ADVision thinpack sets, all the extras have been removed, which is unfortunate since Godannar had some nice extras. Mainly, the clean openings and closings, and various pictures and galleries. You don't get the paper inserts either, and the Godannar insert mini-booklets had some nice mini-posters as well as cast interviews.On the other hand all the packaging is different and kind of interesting for this thinpack release. The box itself is orange overall and contains a terrific picture of Mira, Shizuru, and Godannar on one side (the Mira picture is new) and a picture of Anna on the other side (same picture as the Godannar DVD 7 cover). There are 5 DVDs total, each with 5 episodes except for the last one which has 6 episodes on it. Each DVD thinpack case has an orange cover with a big picture of a robot on it, and each DVD itself has an orange picture with a picture of a girl on it. From first to last, the robot pictures are Godannar (fused), Club Mariner, G-Gunner, Goddiner, and Godannar (blue) with Neo-Okusaer. The girl pictures are Anna, Lou, Shizuru, then surprisingly Luna (pilot of Genesister with yellow hair in pigtails), then finally....Anna's mom?! Yuck oh well. Why not Mira? The Luna picture is new, the rest we've seen before. Kind of weird packaging, but it's for the most part different, and a couple of them are really nice (Mira and Luna).The DVD menus are also new. They are orange too, and stationary, and ugly. Oh well. The show itself is exactly the same as on the individual volumes. The Season 2 intros in particular remain blurry, which sucks.Godannar is the best show ever made though and for this price it's a bargain, so I recommend this box set to anyone who hasn't purchased the individual volumes yet. But if you already have the individual volumes, you probably shouldn't bother getting this. In my case, I found a good deal so I bought it just to have an extra copy of Godannar. I paid close to $30 for this boxset, and I paid about $210 to buy all 7 volumes individually (I paid retail price back then, although I got my copies 2-3 weeks before the release dates because of that). This version can also be more convenient to watch if you want more episodes to be on a disc.Someday I'll have to re-author my own version of Godannar by cutting out the blurry Season Two intros and replacing them with the normal-quality textless Season Two intros found on the original DVDs.",Godannar: Complete Collection
1023547,"What else can you say about a franchise ""restart"" that feels, plays, and ends like a drawn out coda instead of a jubilant new beginning.  Helmer Brian Singer is handed the keys to the character that can do anything, along with 60+ years of stories to draw from, but what does he do with it?  An Oxygen network movie of the week, with almost perfunctory nods to what the character is really about.  Singer attempts to pull drama and tension from the romance of the 80's movies, but since the actual parting between the leads is never adequately explained, there is no real tension in it, nor any real drama to be had in its resolution, only the ill-defined squirming sensation that relationship sitcoms get in season 2.This genre and this character each have clich&eacute;s of their own.  Those clich&eacute;s are fundamental to making the character who he needs to be, and the stories true to that character.  The question has to be: Why do a Superman movie if you don't really want to tell a Superman story?  I am at a total loss for some the new direction taken by this movie.  A new character is introduced that has nothing to do with the established mythos, a character that will gobble plot space in any subsequent in-continuity stories.  Without giving anything away, imagine if you went into a Bond movie, and they had replaced ""M"" with a pair of CGI wisecracking dogs voiced by Robin Williams and Larry the cable guy.  It might be funny, and it might make a few bucks, but it wouldn't be a Bond movie anymore.  That's what we have here:  a story line that drifts cheaply and unnecessarily so far away from the source that it's no longer Superman.Routh and Spacey do serviceable jobs, respecting and building on the previous actors' styles while adding the touches needed for the new project, but Kate Bosworth is a total disaster.  Staggering from scene to scene with a freshly tasered junior high vibe that conveys nothing of what her character is supposed to be.  Lane, the reporter, is 30-ish, sharp, refined, sexy, accomplished, and world weary but still energetic and positive.  Bosworth comes across as 19, slow, dull, suburban, mousey, coddled, and resigned.  (Better casting would have been to put the underutilized Parker Posey in this role, but she's wasted providing paint-by-numbers comic relief.)Even the iconic outfit, a 100% no-brainer, is just wrong.  The color scheme was so bad that I had originally thought it was deliberate disinformation to throw off merchandise counterfeiters.  No such luck.  Baby blue and dark brick red:  The man of steel rendered as your grandma's basement laundry room.Off the reservation on the major plot points, tone deaf on the female lead, wrong on some obvious details, and silent on the continuity problems.

And yet this storyline seems as fresh and captivating as ever. How? What is the key to this show's persistent longevity in time? Well, many of the pieces of that key can be found right here in this very story, actually.First of all, there's the willingness to try new things. The idea of devoting a whole season to an overall meta-storyline (The Doctor and Romana's quest to reassemble the six segments of the Key to Time) of which ""The Ribos Operation"" is but 1/6 of the total is ingenious and inventive. It links the very diverse storylines of this season into a loosely-defined yet epic whole in an interesting manner (and also works to keep viewers tuned in, I imagine). Then too, the idea of making the Doctor's new traveling companion a fellow Time Lord is also a brainstorm of sorts, though a risky one script-wise. While Romana lacks the Doctor's store of experience and ""street smarts"", her level of intelligence and knowledge is equal to or maybe even greater than his--a marked contrast to the prior companion, Leela, while yet another attempt to pair him with a strong female character. But of course that means the Doctor doesn't have to explain anything to her--and hence to us, the viewers. A twin dilemma, to be sure, but an intriguing change of pace nonetheless.Second of all, this is a great story. Kind of like ""The Sting"" set on a distant planet, with two delightfully funny yet cunning con-men swindling a dangerous and emotionally unstable ex-dictator and his soldiers, even as both are callously deceiving the primitive inhabitants of medieval Ribos. And of course the Doctor and Romana get mixed up in this mix-up and mix it up more. Some of the writing here is truly incredible, using the sparsest minimum of references and remarks in the dialogue to evoke a vividly well-rounded sense of Ribos as a place with a distinct society, culture, and history--and then doing the same for the galaxy beyond from which the Levithians and Terrans come. There are truly memorable minor characters too, like the shamanistic priestess Seeker and the scientific heretic Binro--which seems like a superficial science vs. superstition contrast at first, except that the Seeker's predictions are continually dead-on even as Binro's theories are on target. An intriguing bit of ambiguity, a bit more complex than the show's usual gambit of complete demythologization.Finally, it's all great fun, with that strange and unlikely combination of suspense and humor so typical of ""Doctor Who"" through and through. Plus, for any fans of K9, the Doctor's ever-faithful robotic pet, this is his first appearance on DVD so far, though hardly his premier (c'mon BBC, get those DVDs out!). Good directing and fine acting bring all this to life, of course, proving once again that you don't need a million bucks to craft an excellent science fiction show.P.S. ""The Ribos Operation"" DVD is also included with five other DVDs in a box set,Doctor Who - The Key to Time Collection, so unless you have a particular interest just in this one storyline, that may be the better option both in terms of economics and convenience.",Doctor Who - The Ribos Operation VHS
995451,"When I first heard of this DVD and ongoing the Electric Edwardians project I thought it couldn't possibly be all that I was told it was: but it is everything I read of it and more. Others have commented that watching the people in these discarded films is a sad experience reminiscent of seeing ghosts, but I think it's the closest thing to time traveling we have. True these merry people have the First World War soon in their future and I imagine they are all now, even the smallest children, dead, but that's the nature of the past and history, and mightn't some future society look back on our videos and think similarly of us? And are we to be pitied over the fact that someday our age will assuredly pass?What an amazing discovery these films were! Who could guess that a trove like this would come to light and in a time in which they could not only be restored but improved upon in that now we are able to see the denizens of the Edwardian era move in realistic form, exactly as they truly did, rather than the jerky 15 frames per second style we used to associate with images of that period. The Edwardians in these awesome films are so very like us and yet so different. With their expressions and in their liveliness, their jollity and their aura of purpose in the things they are doing, they could easily be people of today. And yet here we also see the world as it was, with early automobiles and ornate horse-drawn carriages and soldiers in formal uniforms marching along, and we see festivals and holidays, grand events and the day to day undertakings of the ordinary, the milling about of factory workers and assemblies of schoolchildren and college graduates. We see horses and shaggy dogs, famous people and the anonymous, houses and public places...  It's truly like re-visiting the north of England one-hundred and more years ago. Electric Edwardians is an archaeological  miracle!",N/A
809335,"Japan, Memoirs of a Secret Empire, a three-part DVD set by PBS, does not cover the entire history of Japan.  This documentary covers the period that started with the arrival of the first Europeans and a bloody civil war raging in the 16th century C.E. that led to the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603 C.E.  After defeating his remaining adversaries in 1600 C.E., Tokugawa Ieyasu was appointed Shogun by the emperor and established his capital in Edo, the future Tokyo, in 1603 C.E.  Ieyasu's successors, the Shoguns, remained in power for over 250 years until the Meiji restoration in 1868 C.E., which ushered Japan into its modern era.  Japan, Memoirs of a Secret Empire, ends with the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry and his ships on Japan's shores in 1853 C.E.  This arrival ultimately sealed the downfall of the Tokugawa Shogunate, which was unable to cope with the opening of Japan to the outside world.  To its credit, Japan, Memoirs of a Secret Empire, brings to light the sophisticated, refined Japanese civilization in its splendor.  This production clearly explained the interactions existing among the Samurai, peasants, artisans, merchants, and the rest of the society such as artists and priests.  Perhaps, more importantly, Japan, Memoirs of a Secret Empire, is an invitation extended to spectators to go (back) to Japan and to better know this unique civilization and state for themselves.",Empires - Japan: Memoirs of a Secret Empire
706909,"This is a beautiful, poetic masterpiece about a lonely, isolated boy living in rural Scotland.  Despite the fact that his surrounding are as bleak as they come (he lives in a Scottish ""ghetto"", and there is a garbage strike on at the time, so debris and rats are piling up everywhere), the film manages to find beauty in all the garbage.  There isn't much of a narrative, but the film is more of an impressionistic piece than a narrative film.  Lynne Ramsay, the director, has made a great debut film.  She has a visual sense that most directors lack.  Many directors (David Gordon Green for example) attempt to make impressionistic films, yet their films end up being incoherent and sloppy.  This film isn't.  Ramsay's choice of music is superlative.  The use of Nick Drake's Cello Song is especially good.  Even though I hate English language films with subtitles, I had to watch the film with subtitles.  The Scottish accents are so thick here that the film would make no sense without the titles.  Ramsay's follow up film to this, Morven Callar, was rather disappointing and a bit of a mess, but here she really shows potential.  Hopefully her next one will be good.",N/A

This could only be of interest to the religious type that needs a refill of inspiration or something.  Only tolerable for the very religious type.The story jumps about in such a way that you had better know it before you start.  [I have read the Bible, all of it.]The main thing I found about the film:  horribly wooden acting performances.  You would have to be terribly distracted by your love of the plot or by the costumes (or something) to not be put off by the terrible acting.  The actors are reading off cue-cards they've never seen before -- or at least it seems like that.  I never thought I would see such a terrible performance by Peter O'Toole -- the director should be banned for life.  You'd think with Peter O'Toole and and Omar Sharif (and others) they could do something (remember Lawrence of Arabia?!).  Oh man!Everything about the film seemed sappy and amateurish.

791939,"This 1970 film from Czechoslovakia is a surrealistic movie that deals with a teenage girl bizarre dreams after reaching puberty. The film is certainly imaginative, has very strong visuals, is submerged in lovely central European folklore and is shot in luscious color. But what bothered me a little was something else: the constant mockery of the Catholic Church. Here one must say that the Catholic Church was not the most oppressive institution in Czechoslovakia in 1970. Rather, this was the time of the communist repression after the breakup of the Prague Spring. So, in light of this, these shots against a potential enemy of the communist regime seem a bit politically opportunistic, and gives a somewhat bad taste to an otherwise fine film.",Valerie and Her Week of Wonders Valerie a týden divu

James Spader goes through some changes as well? That's  the best part, I am not going to give away. This movie takes the whole werewolf legend to a new level. It also gives you a good reference to how we as individuals have to deal with in everyday life situations, dealing with work and relationships in our personal lives, and how some people can be very diseveing and somethings you thought you knew them but you were wrong, and  when things were going right until an unexcpected change in your life changes everything.

He has a good head on his shoulders untill after driving home one night from a business trip changes his whole life forever. That's all I am going to tell you for now. The rest is for you to watch for yourselves. This is a good thinking movie as well as a pychologic thriller.

Ring of Fire boy was talking all movie long about the separation of church and state. What he forgot to mention was that this idea came somewhat later when Jefferson was writing the Danbury Baptists while President, not as a member of the constitutional convention. So, it is no certain that the wall between church and state is as steadfast as these individuals would have you believe.

1089416,"It is not a straightforward story, not by any means. In the beginning there is a line: based on actual events. Perhaps it is true, maybe life is beyond imagination (or the collective beyond any one person's ability to imagine), things have happened that we can not envision, that truth is stranger than fiction. In any case, this is better than any mystery or whodunit movie i can remember, having those sublime moments where you want to hide your eyes because you know something really bad is going to happen to those sympathetic characters you have come to like but are forced open by the realization that you have no idea of what is going to happen to them and you don't want to miss a second of it. I was frustrated at my inability to guess who was the really bad guy, i was shocked at the chain of events at almost every turn and the twists are just plain devious and demented. It is an excellent mystery, a tormented look into how ordinary people react in extraordinary circumstances, a set historical piece with careful attention to detail and a love story, something for everyone (even as the box says: rated R for strong violence, graphic nudity, sexuality and language) Like i said, something for everyone.I put it into the category of a must see movie. a 5 star.there is a very good synopsis of the movie's plot over at the wiki. I could do no better than to encourage people to go read it. Nothing i could write could approach it in completeness. What i'd like to think about is heroes. Especially in the wake of Ken Burn's series on the War, i've been thinking about ordinary people doing heroic things when called upon by extraordinary times. And how so few people seem to be the right kind of heroes. We have lots of heroic efforts in war time, sadly the best and most energies seem to be called out of people when they try to kill each other, or try to survive being killed. The energies of Germany under Hitler ignited Europe, the heroic efforts of people literally burned down and destroyed the work of centuries. Heroes on the American assembly lines of B24's, many or even most women working for the first time out of the house, created waves of thousands of bombers to ignite European and Japanese cities. Heroes on the ground cleaned up the rubble and continued to build their tanks and armaments long after ordinary people would have quit and died. On both sides great heroic energies were called forth out of ordinary people who often rose to the occasion and did things that they themselves could not have imagined just a few years before. Maybe it is the curse of ordinary times that people sleep walk through life never encountering such events that allow them to show what they are really made up of. Maybe it is the salvation of ordinary times that we so seldom encounter such terrible years. But the shame is that they always seem to involve war, never the call to higher ideals and a life of sacrifice to loftier, more noble goals.In this movie we have examples of three types of people rising far above themselves and entering into that realm of heroes. The key character of Rachel, who is ready to do anything to avenge the cruel death of her family, These are our ""normal"" heroes, those we hold up to future generations and teach them that this is how they ought to act in extraordinary times, knowing full well that we didn't in our day and probably nor will they. Then there is the anti-hero, those heroes literally working for the wrong side, Muntze is this sort of person, trying to negotiate a truce with the Resistance. Daring to love in the midst of what he knows will be a losing war for his side, forcing the truth out of Rachel and using it to try to disarm his sadist and cruel commander. There is another kind of ""hero"" as well, if we think of a hero as an ordinary people who responds in amazing ways to these extraordinary events. These too come wearing  black and white hats, some we recognize and have admired for a long time- the Resistance and those pitifully few Europeans who sheltered the Jews from the Nazi rage and death camps. They are protrayed in the movie, like real people with feet of clay, a farm family with Rachel in the barn allowed to eat if she memorizes a verse of New Testament every day before breakfast. Resistance members who exclaim that 40 good Dutchmen and worth more than any number of blank blank Jews. It is these sympathetic, well drawn, realistic characters that really give this movie depth and interest, that make it a really good movie worth thinking about.But like the movie, bracketed by two old friend's chance meeting in Israel, the real heroes of the story are women and how they respond to the evil, cruelty and death of war.Ronnie is the anti-hero for Rachel, the woman who gives into temptation and joins the party. She is the one who survives because she collaborates, she cooperates, she sleeps with the enemy.But Rachel too sleeps with the enemy, deliberately and with great preparation and seduction, yet she falls in love with the enemy, the ultimate betrayal and hopes to spend the rest of her life with him, if only the fates allow. Where Ronnie takes lightly what life offers, Rachel grabs and holds on for dear life. It is this constant contrast that the movie strives for and is it's big point,  Heroes are ordinary people, doing extraordinary things, all the time demonstrating the mixture of good and evil that lives within us all. Those good Dutch people who pounce upon anyone at the end of the war labelled a collaborator and one almost beats Rachel to death because she stands up to their torment and will not publically strip and humilate herself.  Those women like Ronnie who jump into the Canadian jeeps in the same way they jumped into the Nazi conqueror's 4 years before. It is a protrayal of the clay feet of our heroes, the twisted ways people respond to extraordinary events, each trying to make enough breathing space to keep them and their loved ones alive until ordinary times return.In the movie we recognize pieces of how we hope we would react to similar events, those heroes who rise well above and beyond, those villains who capitulate and sell out their friends for their own lives, those greed and gold possessed souls who think of nothing but how to steal and escape to live out their lives in comparative wealth and safety. It is the strength of the movie, and it's underlying script that these things are presented to our conscious minds for our consideration and analysis. The stolen blood money from the doubled crossed and butchered wealthy hidden Jews of the Netherlands, planned by a despotic Nazi for his final solution and safe retirement fund and ending up in the hands of the biggest traitor and with his death Rachel's and the Resistance leader's, ends up financing a kibutizum in Israel that finishes the movie being occupied by soldiers fighting yet another new war.  It is these twists and kinks that make for excellent movie watching and rightly make this an extraordinary movie.A few notes: pay attention to the sounds, even though it is subtitled (you need to turn them on), much of it is in English, but much of it is in several languages simultaneously, a pleasure to listen to.It is a magicans movie, watch their hands, watch for the disinformation and false leads it presents. Enjoy those moments where you feel you must look away but are rivetted to the screen by the action. Look for the subtle and nearly humorous, whose picture is the microphone hidden behind? What are the store fronts that the Resistance uses? Look for the ironies that make for it's lifelike and realistic feel- the truck serves to avoid hitting street urchins who in turn strip the truck of it's camoflage of food leading the Nazis to the weapons and the death of many Resistance fighters. It is a good movie, i see from the wiki article that a book was written FROM the script, odd i thought that all the best movies were from good novels, maybe a few are from good analysis and retrospect on life itself.",N/A

All that and James Whitmore, James Arness, and the cutie Joan Weldon and a ton of ammunition.  This is kind of a serious movie so it requires both popcorn and hot dogs and soda--and remember, when you watch it you haven't got a clue what it's about.PROS:1.  Story line better than so-so.  Handled seriously.  The writers and director took the time to figure it all out before they shot it including having the police in the movie pick up enough clues to tell them what was going on.2.  Whitmore and Arness star...that's a star there.3.  Even the little girl in the first scene can act and she only say's one word!.....I'm watching this again as I write...tell me something--is there anybody in this movie who 'can not' act?4.  At the scene where Whitmore and his police partner enter the general story that has been broke in.  The evidence is mounting.  They find a 30-30 rifle behind the counter...the barrel is bent double.  They find the owner under a trap door in the floor--dead.  A noise from across the room, Whitmore gets up, right hand pats holstered pistol--he gets a stern look on his face then he and his partner advance on the position where the sound came from.  The beginning of the movie is like this, no filler.  By the numbers.  I wish our police were like that around here.5.  There is no doubt about it, the writer of is movie knew exactly what he was doing.  Yes...five stars to the writer.  Whitmore's partner is left alone--We know what's about to happen to him, don't we--Whitmore goes for help.  His partner (a stern face strong lookin fellow) walks into another room, looks down.  Whitmore is heard driving away.  He goes into the ajoining room to turn the radio off.  A sound is heard--it's the monster sound.  He hears it, turns, pulls his gun--smart guy. Without taking his eyes off the direction of the sound, takes a step or two forward to the pull chain light.  Standing under it, no expression change on his face--eyes never wavering from the direction of that sound...neither does his gun.  He reaches up, finds the pull chain switch without looking and turns the light out.  Two steps forward and he is out of that room.  A glance left then right to find the light switch, he finds it, turns the light off...his gun never left the direction of the sound, (is this guy combat trained or something?).  He eases forward, small steps, soft around fifteen steps, never does his eyes or gun waver in the least from that sound.  The monster sound shoots up in volume.  He hesitates, eyes swivel left then right like a gun turret, searching for anything--anything at all.  His gun never moves off target.  The sound is identified as coming from outside, through a big hole in the wall.  He steps to the edge of the hole and stops.  He turns his head right then left--I figure his was making sure which direction the sound came from.  The sound is coming from the left, his head stays turned left, he blinks then steps through the hole.  There is no need to go futher with this discription--we all know what he found.  I will say he got off five shots (off screen) before he yelled.  So, why am I writing this?  Well, it goes to realism.  In all the movies you watch, if there is a darkened corner or hole for a monster to crawl into and hide the actors will find a way to walk or crawl close to it until the monster gets them.  This law officer had the look on his face and (with a little more training about taking proper cover) attention to stealth, and attention span focussing on a possible enemy I've seen from some of our soldiers during Vietnam.  Unlike in the movies...they 'never' took their eyes off their target, and let's face it, his stern face had the look of walking towards a date with destiny.  I don't remember who he is, but he sure could act!Seven.  I don't seen any reason to go through this step by step and tell you everything...I'll jump ahead toward the end.8.  We're in the sewer system now, (or something like it).  The ants have found a new home...they been there for months.  The army is in there to, searching for Them and two lost boys.  James Whitmore gets chewed up by one of the ants as he was saving the two lost boys.  James Arness holds his head up to hear his last words.  The kids are safe.  There is shooting going on, the ants have found the small army unit.  Arness walks back to them and for 23 seconds I have never seen so much ordinance shot down range (in corridor like conditions) at any target as what I have seen here.  It makes me wonder if back in World War Two when some of our smaller units stumbled across an enemy tank/s who spots them at the same time...what was their reaction?  I bet it was pretty close to the same...throw everything you got at'em as quickly as you can, or run.CONS:1.  There are no cons in this movie.Few times have I ever seen a movie so well put together.  The writing is perfect, the actors really act, no subplots get in the way and take away from the main story line and focus.  There is no filler I could find, everyword, every hand motion, seemingly every hand gesture pointed at one thing...the story.  Tight, percise, writing.  It is because of the writing, acting, and obviously directing, THEM must have five stars.  Even though all of it is laid out for the viewer sooner or later I feel you should have the full spread while you watch.  The lights must go off, only you watching the movie so your attention isn't elsewhere--one salad bowl of popcorn, two hot dogs, and a big drink to wash it down with.This kind of movie doesn't require thought to understand--it demands your full attention to get the most out of it.  Bye.P.S.  For those of you who never seen handgrenade explosions the size of these smoke and dusk clouds thrown up by the rifle grenades is pretty close to accurate...of course real military explosions happen in the blink of an eye rather than so slow.",Them VHS

He thought he'd get a big city assignment there like Anchorage, but he got Cicely instead and he has to stay there for four years.His cynicism and bitterness at what he perceives as bad luck is a sort of voice of reality except reality doesn't always win.Quirky, intellectual, philosophical people live in Cicely. All are tolerant of each other and take the time to listen to everyone. Characters are so interesting, nobody watches television (except in one episode in Season Two).In another, Woody Allen's ""mother"" shows up to discuss filmmaking with a local half-Indian boy who wants to become a film director. Grandma Woody and the boy, Ed, sit in the theater and dissect Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries. Grandma Woody concludes, as she told her son Woody, write what you know. write about people. they're only monkeys with car keys.Homages in various forms (daydreams, dreams, wishful thinking) are made to iconic films: Midnight Cowboy, The Graduate, Wizard of Oz, Boys Town and more.Every single episode has something memorable.

1049488,Synopis: Little nine year old Kellyanne (Sapphire Boyce) lives with her parents and older brother in rural Australia. Her Father (Vince Colosimo) is a dreamer who hopes to secure his families future by discovering a cache of opals under the harsh desert climate. As he labors away without reward Kellyanne's Mother (Jacqueline McKenzie) brings in the families only income working as a clerk in a local grocery store. Her big brother Ashmol (Christian Byers) is a well adjusted outgoing child. Kellyanne is quite different. She is a sweet but extremely introverted child who sends all her time communicating with two imaginary friends named Pobby and Dingan.This seemingly harmless fantasy is tolerated by the family to such an extent that they even set two additional plates at the table for the invisible playmates. However when Pobby and Dingan go missing the little girl becomes mysterious ill and nobody knows what to do to restore her to health. That is nobody except her brother Ashmol who decides to organize a search for the lost duo. His biggest problem now is to figure out how do you find something that's invisible?`Opal Dream' ('06) is a endearing story in the tradition of `E.T.' and `Indian in the Cupboard' that can be equally enjoyed by young and old alike. The plot might be a little slow and challenging for some younger children but the implications of this mythic tale from Down-Under are exquisitely subtle and absolutely fascinating. Surely this bittersweet tale of transition from childhood to adolescence will generate much thought in viewers of all ages. What is real and what is imaginary? Do any of us really know for sure?,Opal Dream
222283,"After reading Goldman's novel of the same name and being surprised by some of the twists and turns , I was eager to see how the book was converted to film.  To learn how Scylla the spy, Levy the student, Janey the Provider, and Szell the Nazi were handled.  I was disappointed.Don't get me wrong - the movie is a fine thriller.  It just doesn't match up to what I'd been expecting.  In the novel, Janey's identity is not revealed until halfway through the book, at which point you're shocked to learn the true nature of Scylla's relationship with him.  This is a startling conclusion that is totally glossed over in the film.  Also, while Elsa is transparently in cahoots with the bad guys even in the book, here it's made even more obvious and the viewer's small doubts of, ""Is she good or bad?"" are removed.The movie is good.  You should see it.  But read the book afterward.",N/A
85717,"Stanley Kubrick's great film gets a well deserved first class treatment on Blu Ray.  I saw this film many, many times over the years including it's initial release, which Kubrick controlled.  Each theatre was shipped two new prints of the film and they would run it for a week and then switch to the second print, ship back the first print and be sent another one so that each print would only play for a week.  This was back in the day when movies would only play at a single theatre during their first run.  These films could run for months. No previews before the film during it's initial first run (which Warner respects here once again)  He even insisted that the theatre curtain be open at all times.  What a perfectionest!  Over the years, through VHS tapes, laserdiscs and DVD releases and even a showing on HDNET movies,  this is the best and almost perfect presentation of the film. There isn't a speck on it and the bright and sometimes muted colors are just amazing.  The sound has been mixed into 5.1 surround.  It's a magnificent accomplishment.  I greatly look forward to the high def edition of ""2001: a space odyssey"".  That will probably leave me speechless.This film is an overwelming artist experience and certainly one of the all time best.  It has lost very, very little of it's power over the years.  Some extremely amusing scenes and some horrific ones as well.  Fine performances from everyone in the film and especially by Malcolm McDowell.  There are some roles that certain actors were born to play and Alex is certainly one of them for McDowell.Very interesting supplemental material as well as the short but stunning teaser trailer.If you love this film, don't hesitate to spend the $.

394999,"Robert Talbot (Rock Hudson) visits his beautiful villa in July instead of his regular trips that comes in September. His girlfriend Lisa Fellini (Gina Lollobrigida) has given up waiting for him and has decided to marry an Englishman named Spencer (Ronald Howard). Meanwhile other surprises are in the works, like his villa is converted into a hotel by his staff lead by his butler, Maurice Clavell (Walter Slezak), and the hotel is full of guests; mainly a group of young American women, and a chaperone named Brenda de Banzie (Margaret Allison)) with an eye for Maurice. It is hilarious to watch as the staff tries to keep that secret from Talbot, but it won't be a secret long. In the mean time Lisa breaks off the engagement and stays at Talbot's Villa. Then comes the trouble; a group of American male students arrive at the hotel on a prior reservation, but Talbot cancels the reservation. Then students camp just outside the villa, and start dating the young women who are staying as guests of the hotel. Soon these students find an ""ally"" in Lisa who supports their camp. Talbot gets real worried and his fatherly instincts get better of him, and he forces himself to ""protect"" the girls while they are on date with the boys by chaperoning them. It is hilarious to watch as the boys try to outsmart him by losing him during a date or during a picnic but to no avail.There are some hilarious moments that include; when Lisa snubs the sisters of Spencer who come to meet her; and constant man - woman type of irritation and fights between Lisa and Talbot. The secondary plot brings together young tourists Sandy Stevens (Sandra Dee) and Tony (Bobby Darin), who sings (and wrote) ""Multiplication"" in a nightclub scene. Bobby Darin makes his feature debut in this movie and marry Sandra Dee ten days after the completion of the film. The movie shows some excellent shots in the Italian countryside that includes locations in Rome, Milan and Portofino, and the music is outstanding. The movie is well directed by Robert Mulligan who goes on to make his Academy award winning To Kill a Mockingbird in the following year (1962).

845610,"Grande Ecole (Robert Salis, 2004)Salis (Living Naked)'s first non-documentary feature is an adaptation of a Jean-Marie Besset play which, I confess, I have neither read nor seen. So take this review with a grain of salt; most of the aspersions I'm going to cast here may have less to do with Salis than with Besset.The plot: Paul (Gregori Baquet) and Agnes (Alice Taglioni) are dating. Agnes wants to move in together; Paul would prefer to live on campus with roommates. It quickly becomes obvious that Paul would, specifically, rather live with Louis-Arnault (Jocelyn Quivrin, recently of Syriana). Despite Louis-Arnault having a girlfriend himself, Agnes makes Paul a bet-- whichever of the two seduces Louis-Arnault first can have him. To add onto the complexity, Paul also finds himself drawn to a university worker, Mecir (Selim Kechiouche), who's more open about returning Paul's affections than is Louis-Arnault.There's a whole lot going on here, and Salis wants to pack it all into this film. That's all well and good; the many subtexts here are well worth exploring. Unfortunately, what suffers is the main story itself; what could well have been a sumptuous erotic buffet ends up neither sumptuous nor erotic. The obvious crux of the whole thing is Paul's confusion, but there's never a point where Paul (or Baquet; hard to tell whether the fault is with character or actor) seems at all confused. Which might be excusable if we had any indication that he was manipulating everyone else-- but, of course, we don't get that, either. We've really no idea what Paul is doing here, other than wandering through the movie, barely reacting to the events around him. The rest of the characters are scarcely better; Agnes manages to work up a head of steam every once in a while, but seems to be suffering from sleeping sickness most of the time. Louis-Arnault's hapless girlfriend Emeline has an excuse, at least, as everyone involved is keeping her in the dark, and Louis-Arnault himself manages to show some emotion now and again. Louis-Arnault, in fact, quickly becomes the movie's most intriguing character; one can never be sure whether he's oblivious or leading Paul on, and unlike the rest of the cast, Quivrin pulls the role off with flair. Unfortunately, the longer the movie goes on, the less important Louis-Arnault is to it.I wanted to like this movie. I really did. The best of intentions, however, sometimes can't produce results. So it was with both Grande Ecole and my reaction to it. **",N/A

900069,"I am going to begin with a disclaimer. While I am an avid opera lover, I am not a Maria Callas fanatic. I'm not a Callas hater either. Those who love and loathe Maria Callas know every intimate detail of her life, both on and off the stage, have memorized her recorded legacy, both the official releases and the pirated recordings, and live, breath and die all things Maria Callas. I admire and appreciate her voice, and will admit there are some roles that Callas could do as no one else could, but I would say I have more of a fondness for her than anything else. I say this because as I've heard and read some of the reviews of the film, both on Amazon and in print, Callas lovers seem to have strong opinions of it: they're in love with every aspect of it, or pan it entirely.The film takes place in the 1970's and Maria Callas (played by Fanny Ardant) has become a recluse. The events of her life are well known. In her pursuit of and failure to capture the love of Aristotle Onasis, a love that seemed at times to be cruelly unrequited, Callas' voice has deteriorated and even though she still could have performed based on persona alone, she hides away in a Paris apartment. Her manager Tom Kelly (Jeremy Irons) hates his new role as an agent for a punk rock band known as ""Bad Dreams"" and hopes to convince Callas, whom he once represented, to star in a film version of CARMEN. Well aware that her voice would be inadequate, he tries to convince her to do the equivalent of lip syncing. Callas' temperament gets in the way of anything happening, but at the convincing of reporter Sarah, a friend to Callas and Kelly, (played by Joan Plowright), Kelly works to get Callas to do the film version of an opera she recorded, but never performed on stage.The film is based on some facts as well as some creative ""what if's"" by director and friend Franco Zeffirelli. Any film or stage production under Zeffirelli's direction is lavish down to the minutest details, and CALLAS FOREVER is no exception. Fanny Ardant has Callas' mannerisms, voice, and quirky ways mastered to perfection. She captures Callas' intensity when performing the operatic roles, whether it be the staging of the film version CARMEN or when she recreates the roles in her imagination. Ardant's portrayal of Callas is that of an artist as well as a famous personality. Jeremy Irons is good as Tom Kelly, portraying him as ruthless but also concerned about his former star. Joan Plowright`s portrayal of the fictional character Sarah was stellar. It's her empathy for Callas that motivates Kelly and her determination keeps Callas from becoming a total recluse. Some have commented that the Tom Kelly character and Sarah are actually two versions of Zeffirelli. Zeffirelli was one of Maria Callas' loyalist friends and did try to get her to star in film version of her operas well after she left the stage.When the film concentrated on opera and the person of Callas, it was at its best. Kelly's pursuit of love and his punk rock band seemed to distract. More scenes of Callas recalling her stage triumphs would have been far better, at least for me. Still, it's a great story and any opera lover, Callas aficionado or not, should enjoy it.",N/A
719003,"It's odd that this movie runs three hours and twenty eight minutes and it's considered the short, condensed version of Tolstoy's literary masterpiece.  The novel is actually much better known and deserves to be.  As much I acknowledge King Vidor as the one of the pioneer directors and a maverick who went his own way throughout his career, this movie is a bit of a disappointment.  After all, this is the same director who directed ""The Big Parade"", the anti war movie that launched MGM.King Vidor was not your typical Texan.  Movies he made just before this was ""Duel in the Sun"" for Selznick and ""The Fountainhead"" written by Ann Rand.  This ""War and Peace"" was made in Italy and was produced by Dino deLaurentis.  Vidor and six other writers had the tast of condensing Tolstoy's classic, eliminating major subplots and streamling the storylines of the three protangonists.The main protangonist in the book is Pierre Bezahov, here played by Henry Fonda.  In 1968, Sergie Bondachuk played Pierre and wrote and directed a nine hour and much better movie than this one.  Sergie even looked more like the book Pierre.  Fonda could have played him more accurately, after all, he made ""The Wrong Man"" around the time and he was no longer a spring chicken.  But here, he's dashing even when he wins a duel literally by accident. However, he does his best work when forced to walk as a prisoner to the French.  He shows dignity in such adject conditions.Audrey Hepburn should have been perfect as Natasha and at times, is.  However, it's not very convincing that she's just a naive little girl in the beginning and a woman who's been though a lot at the end.  Not that's not her fault.  Vidor with makeup artists, etc. should have created that illusion.  In fact, the story is supposed to take seven years and this movie doesn't convince us of that at all.Mel Ferrer was Audrey's leading man offscream but he's missing the meloncholy about Andrei is supposed to project.  He does have passible good looks and be standoffish but not really much else.However, he and Andrey do look well together and she also has excellent rapport with Fonda.  Herbet Lom plays an interesting Napolean.  Anita Ekberg looks beautiful and is not asked to do much else.The battle scenes are very well done and there is good levity when Fonda appears as a spectator.  Ferrer's death scene is way too long and a bit unforgivable as some interesting bits of Tolstoy could have gone in.Tolstoy's musing about life are basically unfilmable but something could have gone in.  Instead, the movie ends with Henry and Natasha reunited. However, the main parts of the basic story were covered.I just wish it had more the transcendance that the ending of ""The Crowd"" did.  For that, I guess read the book.",N/A
950706,"Horror maven Wes Craven gets the red out of his eye and moves effectively into the intense Hitchcockian thriller genre.While I admit to being a horror film fan (excluding the slasher and torture sub-genres), I admire Wes Craven when he moves out of his comfort zone and explores other genres.  He did this earlier with the very sensitively directedMusic of the Heartwith Meryl Streep and helped her earn another Oscar nomination with her role as an arrogant but caring music teacher.  Now here he is with a less gore more psychological thriller that Alfred (Psycho) Hitchcock would have made if he was still around.This film has numerous twists and turns and probably the less said, the better regarding plot, but all I'll reveal is that the ever cute Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) is trapped sitting next to the incredibly menacing and slimy Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow inBatman Begins) who blackmails her into cooperating with his plans that are a bit too convoluted to get into the details here.At a tight well-paced 85 minutes McAdams continues to outwit her capture, but Murphy is usually one step ahead of her, or at least only one or two steps in back of her (but he always catches up quickly).  The tension is creatively and believably drawn out and the film is not without its humorous moments to lighten the thick atmosphere at times.  This typically occurs just when the film seems like it's about to take itself too seriously and wants to then step back and give us a wink that clearly says, ""we're just havin' fun here.""High praise all around from the simple B-level set designs, appropriate not-over-the-top music, and clever script to the wholly believable performances of the stars, solid cinematography that clearly has the less is more approach, and the steady controlled direction by Wes Craven who should do more films like this one.Why four stars and not five after all this praise?

As a composite the story hits all the right notes.Melanie (Deborah Francois) is a child prodigy.  She awaits her big chance to make it as a pianist.  At a large try-out, she plays beautifully until someone walks in with a photo for one of the judges to sign.  Then, she falters.  From that heartbreaking moment, the film leaps ahead to a movement in her life many years later when she gets a job as a secretary apprentice at a law firm.  Neatly, she overhears that her employer, Jean (Pascal Gregory) needs a caretaker for Tristan, his only son.  He instantly accepts her overture to fill the position, and her whole life changes.  In their countryside mansion outside of Paris, she hooks up with all the charm of being a caretaker and assistant.  Since both of Melanie's parents are butchers, she takes easily to cooking fare for the family.  Her role expands, though.  Luck has it that his wife, Ariane (Catherine Fro) is a concert pianist, and Melanie is able to give Tristan some piano lessons.  From here her meticulousness lends itself to other privileged duties up to and including the entrusted role of page turner for Ariane's consequential radio concert.  Like a fairy tale, they both bond, and Ariane assists Melanie with make-up and perfume.  Melanie has a special touch to encourage Tristan to push himself and help Ariane to get over her trepidation to perform after a car accident two years earlier made her falter on stage.  Can Ariane and Melanie deliver each other from their past?Everything doesn't always go well, but the development and outcome are meant to be seen.

647414,"I'm a big fan of del Toro's films, film scripts and direction, not to mention his incredibly sensitive and gorgeous cinematography.  I love this movie but won't go into why here as this is a review of the 2-disk DVD.I definitely recommend this set over the single disk theatrical release. Del Toro's discussion of the concepts he applies to his filmmaking and his fascinating alternative audio commentary alone are well worth the price of the extra disk, but additionally, the 2-disk set provides a great short in which the actors discuss their roles, with emphasis on the actor who plays both the faun and the Pale Man, along with the prosthetics and special makeup needed to make these bizarre creatures so believable. Very little CGI was used in the film, by the way. There's also a segment of the ""Charlie Rose"" show in which del Toro and two of his friends, fellow innovative directors and countrymen discuss their work and what it is they hope to achieve.Luckily, there's not an English-dubbed version of the film on the 2-disk set, just a Spanish version with or without English subtitles. A version dubbed in English would be a desecration.  The extras are all in English except when the actors spoke Spanish, in which case English subtitles are provided.  Del Toro's excellent commentary and discussion are in English.I even watched the film without sound or subtitles just for fun, and I saw so much more, despite the fact I've seen it several times already. So many levels so magnificently done! Bravo!",Pan's Labyrinth
655051,"On the surface it is a historical movie about the work of William Wilberforce against the English participation in the African slave trade at the turn of the 19th century.But i think that the writer's had much more to say about English society than this, things that are still important and ought to be considered.Their deeper criticism is about the hierarchical nature of English society, the rulers and the ruled, the elite landowning and servant owning class and the masses of people toiling in the farms, fields and factories. There are several places where this criticism breaks the surface of the movie: the scene where the servant steps over the fence and sits in the field with Wilberforce and together contemplate spider webs, the scene in Parliament where the Whig opposition leader asks Wilberforce ""the people?"", and the analogy of America opening the bottle of revolution and France pouring it out.The defenders of America slavery in the 19thC took the issue of the hierarchical nature of society very much to heart, Robert Dabney in defense of virginia, stated boldly that without a natural hierarchy and an elite of rulers, and an underclass of slaves, Christian society was doomed to a radical equalitarianism stemming from the French revolution's atheistic call of arms.Wilberforce himself was an independent, but he supported wholeheartedly the Tory administration of his friend William Pitt, elements of this friendship make up a substantial thread in Amazing Grace. It is the Tory flurtation with French revolutionary thought that gets Wilberforce and others in trouble during the war years with France. The movie firmly takes a stand not only against the slave trade, for the moral improvement program of Wilberforce, but for the gradual flattening of English society into a meritocratic democracy rather than the traditional Whiggish view of elitism, as the movie so aptly sums it up near the end in the term-""Nobilis oblige"".What i find curious is that only one review here hints at the larger criticism of society that this movie attempts. Slavery is not a burning issue in our society, but wage-slavery (as the wobblies pointed out) is much the same thing, elitism and a heritary hierarchy without reference to individual achievement is a big problem in England and an increasing problem in Western culture in general and the US in particular. If you look at the movie in this way it becomes not so much a criticism of a form of economics which rightly died in the mid 19thC, but part of an ongoing struggle for genuine participation in political and social life for all people, not only the ruling classes.I think that the writers avoided strongly pursuing this theme because the current climate of the natural audience of the movie, Christians are far more aligned with Whiggish theories of history and economics then classical liberal Tory type views and they really couldnt sell the movie to this group if they had made the elements stronger. but the fact that in Christ there is no Jew nor Gentile, no rich or poor, the theme of the field scene about spider webs and such, is one of the greatest criticisms of a hierarchical society that mankind has ever believed.It is a good movie, just look a bit deeper than a historical piece about Wilberforce and the ending of the british slave trade. it is an amazing and productive period of history and i'm glad someone was able to make a somewhat popular movie about a few of the pieces of the puzzle that is the Whig-Tory 18-19thC dance.",Amazing Grace [Theatrical Release]

1052548,"I really wanted to love this film. I thought it would have everything that could possibly appeal to me - a beautiful setting, gore, humor, suspense, Brazilian music.Nope. Fell flat, right on its face. Now, anyone could tell by the trailers and some of the movie posters that it would be a Hostel rip-off. I'll give it credit in saying yes, it is much more believable than Hostel in that organ donation participation could certainly stand to be increased (not only in smaller countries, but everywhere). And yes, I imagine a well-cared-for American organ would most likely be a very, very good thing to a villager in another country in dire need. So that's the upside - that this could quite conceivably happen, I suppose.I just really wish the matter was approached differently. Again, we have foolish characters far from home. A rickety bus ride through a winding mountainside? SURE! Walking through this jungle in the middle of nowhere to have a freakin' drink? I'll lead the way! Following this young boy who barely speaks English deeper into the jungle and putting my life in his hands? WHY NOT?! It just exasperates me, the level of sheer stupidity that these characters display.Parts of the movie were entirely too dark - I had to temporarily up the contrast on my TV just so I could see what happened once they reached Kiko's uncle's house. Other parts of the movie were absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes were beautiful to watch.

1069344,"For me, this isn't one of the better seasons of ""Dallas"".  I think it only goes down hill after this 1983-84 season.  There's no need to give short episode summaries, since someone else already has.  One of the first really bad continuing story lines occurred this season.  I'm referring to the terrible, ill conceived  romance between Peter and Sue Ellen.  It might have been a little more tolerable if the producers had hired a good actor to play Peter, but instead they got Christopher Atkins.That brings me to the subject of another bad casting move, just to get a big name.  The producers hired Priscilla Presley when they re-cast Jenna Wade.  These two bad casting jobs are enough for me to pass on buying this season, though there are some good story lines.",N/A
865496,"The title of this documentary from Mongolia is not a metaphor - there is an actual weeping camel in the movie. Directed by a Mongolian woman and an Italian man who met as students at a German film school and set in the Mongolian steppe, the plot is slight and the directing style is somewhat artless, yet the story is charming and interesting. After a difficult delivery, a mother camel refuses to nurse her young. The camel owners (nomadic Mongolian shepherds, living in a ger in the steppe) send their two children to the city in order to get a violinist to convince the camel, through music, to feed her baby. And the movie allows us to see a particular civilization that is increasingly encroached by the modern world (one of the movie's most poignant scenes had the children demanding their father for a television).",The Story of the Weeping Camel

209343,"I remember seeing this for the first time when I was in 6th grade about 4 or 5 months after release date in dollar theatre.  I remember thinking at the time ""boy! this is the greatest movie ever!""  I was so used to the original that I mistook the characters of Johnny(Adrien Zmed, then star of TJ Hooker) & Stephanie(then unknown-turned household name mega moviestar Michelle Pfeiffer) as Danny Zucko & Sandy Olsen.  It took me awhile to figure out that these were new goups of T-Birds & Pink Ladies & exchange student Michael(Maxwell Caulfield) would become Stephanie's boyfriend (after becoming a ""cool rider"").Despite poor ratings & nothing based on a Broadway musical w/same characters & story (to best of my knowledge) this is still fun to watch & I recommend for anyone who loves the '50's & '60's & music that makes you want to get up & dance.  The clothes & hairdos are excellent & kind of show how the looks were similar almost at the time the movie was released (new wave, 50's-'60's clean looks, no more tackiness laid-back '70's styles).Similar to both stage & screen of first ""Grease,"" we have twentysomethings, some pushing 30 at the time, playing high school minors & they appear a little too mature & adult looking.  Only exception were Pamela Segall(Delores) & Leif Green(Davey). Ms. Segall was about 14 when the movie was made & young Mr. Green also looks about 17-19.  (I once confused him w/'70's teenybopper Leif Garrett but realized they are two different actors)The musical #'s are great & catchy.  The choreography is also great & it's amazing how talented the T-Birds & Pink Ladies are.  Leif Green makes for a good clumsy, naive, scared-to-fight T-Bird whose bowling ball is too heavy but very flexible if you notice he can do the splits when he jumps up in the ""Score Tonight"" #.  ""Score Tonight"" would probably be my favorite musical # & what I reccommend as a sneak peek for those who have never seen this movie.  ""Cool Rider"" & ""Who's that Guy?"" sound very then-the-style new wave.Chris McDonald(Goose) is so young looking & almost unrecognizable then.  Unfortunately he didnt age very well in appearances in past 15 yrs & seems to be typecast as a nerdy guy in ""Flubber"" & ""Leave it to Beaver.""I wish there were more scenes w/Pamela Segall as she is credited as being one of the Pink Ladies.  I just read on imdb.com that at the time she was involved in an auto accident & stand-in was used for some scenes.  This may also expl why she's not seen w/the other 4 Pink Ladies for most of the movie.  She makes a good tough talking HS freshman Pink Lady. In spite of the accident, it's good to pair her character up w/Davey & more scenes should'v showed them together.",N/A

854356,"First of all this is very much an orthodoxy Christian world view on secular music. I first saw this when I was a brand new baby Christian. I already knew that many artist like ""The Doors"", ""AC/DC"", ""Kiss"", ""Led Zeplin"", etc. where all Satanic and I stopped listening to all those guys... and I loved them too. Music was and still is a center piece in my life.After watching this video I stopped listening to secular music (voluntarily). Months later I listend to one of those ""good"" bands, one which I wouldn't have thought of as Satanic in the least bit. The Foo Fighters... they were my favorite of the bands still making music at the time. I cried after truly listening to the lyrics of their music. Many of their songs actually mock Christ!!! He also states how happy he is to be a member of Satan's followers in many of his songs... it's deep in the lyrics but easy to see with the mind of Christ. Needless to say, I never listened to them again (voluntarily).Music stays with you and sticks with your spirit forever. You need to purge all the evil with you. Christ has nothing in common with Satan, so you shouldn't either. This video does define that line very well. If you don't believe the Bible is the inerrant word of God then you will not agree with this video... but it's still the most education video on music in America that I've ever heard of!I'd recommend this for all peoples... but not all ages. The subject matter deals with the Spiritual, Social, Mental, Sexual, and Occultic connections of Western Secular Music. I personally wouldn't show this to anyone who isn't mature enough to talk about sexuality. The topics on the first disk are tame enough, but the second disk might as well have that written on the top. It's well censored, but not so much that you lose the idea of what's going on. There's a lot of shock in this too... for all you people who've yet to be jaded by the world... God bless you guys too.If this video doesn't shock you, then you've personally served under satan willingly and can testify to the truth in the documentary.",Hell's Bells 2: The Power and Spirit of Popular Music- New 6 1/2 Hours
720445,"Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman living in an overcrowded, Jewish Ghetto in 19th century England. She is surrounded by looming, oppressive, dreary, featureless, worn brick architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, blacked out windows, and hordes of black-and-brown jacketed crowds.She lives in a tiny apartment with her large family whom operate a clothes shop within the apartment. As child, she worked, had no privacy, wore colourless clothing, shared a bed, and remained silent to avert the mockery of her mother and siblings who ridiculed her for mimicking them out of boredom.As a young woman, her life remains the same - she has no privacy, lives in a state of mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and inertia, exhudes a blank, featureless expression, is cloathed in plain, unremarkable clothing, and is continuously oppressed and dwarfed by the grey, mundane, massively imposing buildings, and narrow streets, and narrow hallways, and narrow doorways, and her loud-mouthed mother and siblings, and the prosaic, banal lifestyle of her family.Her only form of mental escape is the Yiddish theatre. Sitting in the balcony, front row, leaning over the rail, there is a vast space between her mind and the stage, a space that enables her to breathe, think, feel, and yearn.Yet despite the freedom of thought the open stage provides for Esther, her face and body remain torpidly somnolent, impassive, dispassionate.The plain and common looking Summer Phoenix brilliantly conveys Esther's emotionless demeanour - Summer/Esther does not convey any desire to want anything or anticipate anything.After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decides to break free from the bleak life she is trapped in.She is eventually cast in minor parts in a few stage plays, and meets Nathan Quellen, portrayed by quintessential British actor Ian Holm, who commences to teach Esther the technical skill of acting.From this point forward, Esther begins a grueling dual journey of learning how to act and learning how to feel.She begins experiencing emotions she never felt before, and she begins gaining the experience she needs to fully comprehend and wield the technical aspects of acting.Nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitancy, anger, disgust, self-loathing, etc; she then begins walking though those emotions in her personal life.There are three truths, Nathan tells her - the truth of how a character reacts, the truth of how the actor would react, and the truth that a character and actor are not the same person.These technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct Esther's defenses and lead her to two edifying experiences in the denouement of the film which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought, movement, and emotion.Esther Kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of its odd and narrow camera shots, lackluster photo direction which conveys the realistic lackluster setting of the Ghetto, and Summer Phoenix's characterless and insipid and unappealing portrayal which brilliantly conveys Kahn's mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and lackluster nature.A must-see film for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting, and for people who appreciate minimalistic films and character studies.",Esther Kahn

348252,"A relatively little-known but fascinating movie. Made during the German occupation of France, the film is set in the Late Middle Ages and deals with two envoys of the devil, Gilles and Dominique (Alain Cuny and Arletty, wonderful both) that arrive posing as wandering minstrels at the castle of a Baron where preparations for an upcoming wedding are being made. Their intention is to create havoc by breaking the hearts of all involved. These envoys have extraordinary powers to achieve these goals, like slowing time to a stop so that they can work on their targets at ease. Eventually, the very devil shows up at the castle in disguise. One can argue that the devil in the movie stands for Hitler and the Nazis and so forth, but the film works even if you don't try to watch it as a metaphor for the contemporary events of the time.

The 1984 season of ""Superfriends:The Legendary Superpowers show"" only had eight 1/2 hour episodes (sixteen,  11 minute episodes if you break them down), but with most DVD box sets all that could easily fit on one disk. I am hoping the 2nd disk has the follow up season ""Galactic Guardians"", which only had seven 1/2 hour episodes with some being a full 1/2 hour, and some being two short episodes. These would be great to package together as one set, but I fear WB will get cheap and try to get the most for their money that they can.

388683,"This little film is a bit different and it's pretty well done. I really can't complain about the quality in sound, video, clarity, casting and so on. All those things are quite good. I was a little bored with it however. It struggles to hold your attention long enough to get it's message out. It does have a great ending which is a very nice change, and there are a lot of guys in it, several of which were very pleasing to the eyes. It's all about one guys journey to the fast paced, one night stand after another all summer long in the ultimate gay party spot of Provincetown. He is looking for fun, or so he thinks, but he might just find something a whole lot more satisfying within his own heart. This guy has a problem being majorly shallow. The film is not all that immune from the same disorder, but both seem to make an amazing recovery in the end. In fact, the film makes a nice point in the ending if you can stay with it long enough to get that far. It's got some low spots to endure, but this film really does have a few high spot that make it worth watching. While most of the content is not my personal cup of tea and some of it was just not really worth watching at all for me, I can't honestly say it's a bad film. It's not by any means a blockbuster, and not one I will be watching over and over again. I would recommend this one to a select group of gays who are into the party life of sex and drugs. Those will find it most entertaining. If you are not into that sort of thing, You, as I, will be more comfortable watching something else. There are a whole lot better movies out there to choose from in my humble opinion. Nevertheless, I give this one three stars. One for the quality, one for casting and acting, and the other for the ending which doesn't just leave you hanging and feeling like you got nothing at all out of your time viewing it. I would recommend a lot of other films over this one, BUT if you are determined to watch it, just keep expectations low, and consider your own feelings about the subject matter.",Lie Down With Dogs VHS

While it is effective as a horror story about the profound ignorance and deep-seated prejudices of the Americans it caught 'Candid Camera'-style, this would have been better as a 5-minute skit on 'The Daily Show'. It relies far too much on toilet/gross-out bits for laughs, which in a very limited form appeals to the 15-year old in all of us. However, in a full-length movie it just doesn't cut it.I recall watching an episode of Tom Green's old TV show wherein he was suckling the mammary gland of some bovid (!) and asking the camera, ""Is this comedy?""No, Tom, it isn't.

372300,"I've always had two minds about this movie.  As a ""movie"" it's good.  The acting is well done, the script, except in a couple of spots, is logical and works well, the photography is excellent, and the special effects- for the time- were well executed.However, as an accurate account of what happened on the Titanic, it's a dismal failure.  However, it was not made as a documentary.I was excited about receiving the DVD version of this movie, because it included a commentary track.  I'm not so excited now.The contributions by Audrey Dalton (wonderful actress- never got the chance she should have) about the filming and her interactions with Barbara Stanwyck and the others in the cast- plus the crew- are excellent.The contributions by Michael Lonza about the special effects and Robert Wagner are good also.  (Mr. Lonza gets to be a bit of an irritation toward the end because he repeats himself.)But the part by Sylvia Stoddard- listed as a ""Titanic Historian"" is awful.  She does nothing to clarify the accident and actually gets most of her commentary wrong.  This is surprising, since her credentials as a historian are beyond question- having written incisive and in-depth studies of the ""Brady Bunch"" and ""Gilligan's Island.""  She is also listed as a member of the Titanic Historical Society, an organization with a membership list as exclusive as the Publisher's Clearing house mailers.These are just a few of her egregious transgressions:-The reason ""Sir"" Bruce Ismay wasn't portrayed in the movie is because he was still alive at the time it was made and the producers were afraid of a lawsuit.  Bruce Ismay died in 1937 and he was never knighted.-There was only ONE pair of binoculars on the WHOLE SHIP, and those were on the bridge.  The crows nest pair had been left ashore.  Actually there were several pairs aboard and the pair that were supposed to be in the crows nest was locked in one of the officer's cabins.  Fredrick Fleet, the lookout that spotted the iceberg said that the binoculars furnished by the company were of such low quality that they were next to useless anyway.-There were no historical sources available about the Titanic when the movie was made other than the record of the two inquiries.  Apparently the sources we have available today sprang from nowhere later.-Smith had decided to retire from White Star, but Ismay begged him to stay on until after Titanic's maiden voyage.  Actually, it's unclear whether Smith was going to retire at all, although most historians believe that he decided to make the voyage and then leave the line.-Ismay was pushing Smith ""almost hourly"" about making a record passage.  Titanic's speed at the time of the accident was just about the same speed that her sister- Olympic- had been making on her maiden voyage.-She has so much detail about the iceberg that she must have been in the crows nest herself and seen it personally.-Nobody knows how the ship came to be tagged as ""unsinkable."" Actually, the reference came from a magazine called the ""Shipbuilder"" published in 1911.-She tells everyone that the decision to steer to port was made because it's ""traditional"" for ships to pass objects on the port side.  The decision to pass is made based on location and relative speeds.-She makes a statement that the movie gets the crows nest call ""Iceberg dead ahead"" correct, because if the lookouts said ""Iceberg right ahead"" the bridge would incorrectly interpret it as the iceberg being to the right of the ship.  Actually it would have meant the same to the officers on the bridge.  If the iceberg was to the right of the ship, the call would have been ""Iceberg off the Starboard bow.""  Fredrick Fleet, the lookout who reported the iceberg to the bridge stated that he did say ""Iceberg right ahead.""I'm running out of room, but you get the idea.If the producers of the DVD had looked a little further they could have found someone that actually knew something- or had at least read a book- about the voyage and the ship.",Titanic VHS

And they just don't return; they have become more ""ubiquitous."" They pop up whenever and wherever they want, and never fail to send signals before they terrorize the victims with strange noise or something else.That means, you can read the pattern; once you do, you only wait for the next scary part to be delivered. The film becomes a series of set-pieces. They are cleverly staged, but they soon begin to be less and less shocking as the film goes on. The dark, brooding photography by Katsumi Yamagijima (famous for collaboration with Kitano) is fantastic, and yes, there are some jump-in-your-seat moments and unpredictable things (like that ""milk"" scene), but nothing really scary or chilling.""The Grudge 2"" has three stories loosely connected to each other (one of them is set in USA though the ""Chicago"" scenes are in fact shot in Japan) and none of them is hard to follow, but none of them is really intriguing either. You don't know what really happened to the main characters until the last chapter where different times and spaces start to merge with skillful editing. (This is a method the director used for his Japanese film ""Reincarnation."") By then, however, most of us have lost interest in the film itself, which only repeats the same trick as the first ""Grudge"" installment.After all with this jumbled storyline, we cannot relate to any of the characters, and we just don't care if someone is dead or survives. There are some nice twists given to the plot (relations between Amber Tamblyn's character and Kayako, for instance), but they are introduced so abruptly that it is neither surprising nor interesting.

For this disjointed, vaguely attached to ""Midsummer"" romp, the wisely chosen way to go is a modern dream: a dream on the Shakespearian subject one might have this very evening.The music is the star. Purcell is divine in this reading. The ditties are catchy and rare, fun and tinged with melancholy, simple and complex...all at once. The imagery doesn't try too hard to make sense of the tableaux... just enough for it all to hold up more than what it originally was... which was a parade of allegorical characters ""Night"", ""Secrecy"", the 4 Seasons, Hyman, Phoebes... This version is not unlike a string of music videos that have a thin thread to hold them together.Because this is a modern dream, the costumes and scenery are modern in their look and symbolism. The dance is perfect for the 20th century feel, it's not Swan Lake, y'know. The dance is remarkably balanced with the dramatic and comic action. Again, the music is the catalyst and whole reason for anything. It is well worth the time to watch. But it never goes over the top, really. There is an English reserve about it. Duh!Another opera that has a similar type of approach .... though it does go over the top and is more period... is Les Arts Florissants and the Opera National de Paris's production of Rameau's ""Les Indes Galantes"".

Several possible scenarios are proposed to explain the questionable nature of his death, without shedding new light about this mystery.The film consists of two intertwining stories.  L.A. gumshoe Louis Simo played nicely by Adrien Brody, at the behest of Reeve's doting mother is investigating the circumstances behind his death.  Meanwhile the later stages of Reeves life is examined in retrospective fashion.  Reeves played surprisingly well by a too often wooden Ben Affleck is battling depression and alcoholism.

He is in effect being kept by his married lover Toni Maddox, played by star of the film, Diane Lane.  Lane is married to powerful MGM honcho Eddie Maddox played by an ancient looking Bob Hoskins.Reeves eventually dumps his lover for a younger model played by a manipulative, gold digging Robin Tunney giving both she and Lane motive for killing him.  Brody also uncovers a connection to organized crime with a vengeful Hoskins, also making him a suspect.The highlight of the film however was not the acting but the sets.

Writers brought back Alice Ghostley with the new character of absent-minded Esmeralda in Season Six (Ghostley originally played hapless housekeeper Naomi in a Season Two episode, ""Maid to Order"").What I love about Season Five is the amount of episodes with my favourite character, Serena.  Elizabeth Montgomery relished the chance of cutting loose as Samantha's zany cousin; and all of the episodes in which she features are a delight.  With little Tabitha quickly growing up--and mastering her powers--Samantha has lots of trouble concealing her abilities, especially in front of Darrin's meddling mother!COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:""Samantha's Wedding Present"" - When he refuses to let Sam accept a belated wedding gift from Endora, Darrin is shrunk in size.""Samantha Goes South for a Spell"" - Mistaking Sam for her troublemaking cousin, a jealous witch sends her back in time to the Old South.

What makes this stand out is the musical numbers, and, of course, the entrance of Carmen Miranda with some of her most popular music (including ""South American Way"").  Though, this was Carmen Miranda's introduction and debut on the silver screen, in the United States, it wasn't her first film.  Miranda made several films in her adoptive country of Brazil (she was born in Portugal).  Though, she is charming here, I find it poignant to watch.  Carmen Miranda's life was not joyful, though, it was hard to believe for many because she put a brave face on in the public eye and exuded a (rather forced) atmosphere of joy whenever she made an entrance in a film.  Still worth a look!  It's bubbly fun and Miranda does make you forget ""in the South American way.""",N/A

The very simple, yet very complicated, scenario is populated by real, fleshed-out characters, given complete interpretations by a stellar cast. Ms. Cruz, of course, is luminous, and her talents belie  atrocious handling in Hollywood. Those beautiful eyes say so much, and her control centers the crazy goings on. It's hard to describe the plot, even a bit, without blabbing away vital plot-points, but it's certainly a showcase for women, which is where Sr. Almodovar excels. All of the women fit their roles perfectly, and the great Carmen Maura is back to add endless intrigue. Indeed, so many women with so many completely different issues, in this age of ""thankless role for women"", is certainly a treasure. The brilliant use of color to enhance the proceedings, as well as the mind-blowing plot(s), put this high on Sr. Almodovar's list of fine achievements.",N/A

399494,"I gave this movie two stars because Oliver Stone is a brilliant filmmaker with a high level of talent, but I simply cannot understand why he had to be so dishonest about his subject. There was so much wrong with Richard Nixon that there is little justification for making things up. Anthony Hopkins, a magnificent actor, gave a superlative performance and played Nixon exactly the way the Director undoubtedly wanted him to--as a psychopathic, blithering, hard-drinking ape. This is totally unfortunate as he could have made an excellent work of art from this story. Many of the lines attributed to the principal players--like Sorvino's Kissinger saying that had Nixon been loved as a child things would have gone differently--are so fantastic as to boggle the mind. Nixon's relationship with his wife may have been one of the few things the man did right in his life, but Stone infuses their bond with total torment. Why he did these things I cannot fathom. I just finished a biography on the 37th President and his financial shenanigans alone would have been enough to base a movie on. The guy was a big-spending liberal, paranoid, and disloyal. In short, he was an embarrassment to both the right and the left. Why not simply tell the truth? That would be demeaning enough but what we have here is not a man but a total caricature of one. The depiction is so patently ridiculous that it cannot even effectively function as propaganda, as, to most sensible people, it is simply unbelievable. What a waste.",Nixon VHS

646793,"While I loved the movie, I strongly suggest you read the book as well. There are differences between the two and, of course, verbal descriptions of characters' thoughts are often hard to reproduce on screen. Almost always, sacrifices must be made in the script - and this film is no exception. However, I DO feel the movie stays true to the INTENT and MESSAGE of the book and it is quite a wonderful film.It is futuristic and if you know anything about the author of the book on which this film is based (P.D. James) you'll know this isn't her usual mystery story. But it is one of my favorite works that she has written, telling of a time when people are infertile and of the hope that resides when there is a chance that someone can produce children again.The government gets involved and there are political messages and subplots, all set against a certain, dark atmosphere. This film will make you think and I actually find the possibility of a future where infertility is almost the norm not outside the realm of possibility.

1035874,"To be honest, if it hadn't had the ""Robotech"" label on, it would have gotten two stars (or less...).  I've been an avid Robotech fan since I was introduced to the novels back in 1991 (missed it when it first aired on TV).  I went on to read all of the books multiple times and caught every episode at least twice while it was aired on the Sci-Fi channel.  I've built the models, played the RPG and am a retular visitor to robotech.com, so I was, obviously, looking forward to this movie for quite some time.  I should have learned by now that nothing ever lives up to the hype.  Granted, this movie is really only a pilot episode by HG to see just how much $$$ Robotech is still capable of bringing in (hey, money makes the world go round), but they may have alienated more fans than they brought in with this one.  I hate to say it, but first and foremost - as numerous people have already mentioned - the women were so rediculously out of proportion it was like I was watching an episode of Love Hina.  Robotechs light-hearted silliness is based on substance, not rediculous drawings, I mean, c'mon, did a h*rny 13-year-old make that call?  Next, on to the animation quality.  Overall, the animation was ok (hard lines and weak shading not withstanding), but the CG stuff was really disappoinging.  The veritechs looked pretty good, but movement was akward and often choppy.  The explosions ranged from pretty good to just plain lousy.  The ships weren't too bad, but the invid didn't really do it for me either.  I guess CG is the wave of the future, but it will never be able to take the place of hand-drawn animation.  The story and characters also left a lot to be desired - many MAJOR characters were not present or even mentioned.  Rumor has it that some were killed off, while others will 'make their appearance' if another installment is ever made.  The familiar voices were definitely a plus though.  I was more than glad to see just how many of the original cast made it back.  In conclusion, this episode didn't add ALL that much to the story, but it did end rather abruptly to leave us hanging.  As a die-hard Robotech fan, you may feel compelled to buy it, but I urge you to rent, even if it means more won't be made.",Robotech - The Shadow Chronicles Movie
733713,"Having first seen this movie in my youth and recently watching it again as an adult, it has never lost its charm or appeal and I think it deserves to stand as one of the most fulfilling and heartwarming family films ever made.  As it is based on a true story, that makes it even better.  And what a story it is too.Game warden George Adamson and his wife Joy are residents in Kenya, Africa and relate their experiences of raising an orphaned lion cub after the mother has been shot out of self-defense reasons.  Actually it is three lion cubs but two are sent off to a zoo and the third, eventually named Elsa, is raised by Joy Adamson.  It is interesting and enjoyable to watch the interaction of the cub with the adults and the relationship that grows ever closer between them.  Upon raising the cub to maturity, it becomes a difficult time for the Adamson's knowing that releasing the grown lion into the wild is the only real answer.  Due to being tame for so long, it is Joy's responsibility now to train Elsa to be able to survive on its own and she does an admirable job.  When the fateful day finally comes, it tugs at the heart strings to see the emotional effects on the Adamson's when releasing something they love so dearly.  It is also inspiring knowing that they cared so much and did it for all the right reasons.  It eventually makes for a wonderful end to a great movie.As for the film particulars, the cinematography is very attractive in Africa and the accompanying music is a perfect compliment to everything else.  The acting is so innocent and natural you can almost be fooled into believing this isn't a movie.  For being a timeless classic that is now over 4 decades old, this movie stands the test of time and will always be a treasure for anyone and everyone.  This is a highly recommended film all around.",N/A
118825,"Kubrick's final effort is also his greatest masterpiece: a humane and expressionistic fable, endlessly complex and guardedly optimistic.A few notes about the Blu-Ray disc of ""Eyes Wide Shut:""The Blu-Ray is the unrated version of the film, meaning it does not have those CGI figures added to the orgy scenes to obscure the simulated sex.  (The CGI figures were added in order to secure a U.S. theatrical release rating of ""R,"" without Kubrick's input; their only purpose was censorship.  The version released on Blu-Ray, which was released theatrically in Europe but until now has not been available in the U.S., restores those shots to the way Kubrick filmed them.)The Blu-Ray disc contains all of the special features from the standard-definition DVD in the boxed DVD set, and they are interesting enough.  The aspect-ratio of the Blu-Ray is 16x9, which is a vast improvement over the old 3x4 DVD, as 16x9 is much closer to the theatrical aspect-ratio for which the film's shots were composed. The High-Definition film transfer is beautiful, pristine, the images luminous and rich.  For a film as beautifully photographed as this, in which the texture of the image conveys essential, visceral meaning, the difference between High-Definition and Standard Def might make the difference between fully receiving the film and not.If you've gone Hi Def and are thinking of buying this to replace your old standard-def 3x4 DVD, by all means do so.  Short of a new 35mm print of the unrated version, this Blu-Ray disc -- displayed on a big 1080 set in a dark room, uninterrupted -- is how this challenging and ultimately thrilling film should be seen, and seen again.",N/A

994617,"Masters of Horror has been good but very uneven in its execution. Haeckel's Tale is the last episode for Season One and it sure ends the season on a disturbingly kinky compilation of twisted grotesqueries. The story is from a Clive Barker short story that's been adapted by Mick Garris (fellow Masters of Horror director and also its brainchild) and produced by George A. Romero to be directed by John McNaughton.Already, one wonders why Romero would be producing instead of directing the piece. Scheduling conflicts prohibited Romero from taking the director's chair and he instead recommended John McNaughton (his one film which earned him Master of Horror status is one of the best horror films of the last qurater century: Henry - Portrait of a Serial Killer). The fact that Romero was originally chosen to direct Barker's Garris adapted short story means there's got to be zombies or some form of undead within. I, for one, was glad that Romero decided that he wouldn't be able to direct and chose another in his stead. Barker's short story does indeed include zombies but it also has a heavy sense of the old classic technicolor Hammer Films vibe to it. Haeckel's Tale under the capable hands of McNaughton takes those Hammer Films conventions and ramps it up into overdrive.Even though John McNaughton really has only one true horror film under his belt (he also directed a little-known cult scifi-horror called The Borrowers which had fledgling effects shop KNB FX still doing things guerilla-style), but his work in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer more than earns him his horror creds. In Haeckel's Tale, John McNaughton clearly has a bit of fun making the only true period piece in the whole Masters of Horror series. McNaughton goes for the classic Hammer Films look for this episode and it shows in the gothic, fog-shrouded atmosphere in the outdoor scenes. The look of the costumes and even the dialogue harkens back to those Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Hammer Films.The story is a mixture of the Frankenstein tale with a some Cemetary Man mixed in. Haeckel's Tale begins somewhere around the 1800's and I'm assuming close to the end of it from the costume worn by Steve Bacic who played Mr. Ralston who arrives to seek the help of Miz Carnation who is purported to be a necromancer who can grant him his wish to have his dead wife brought back to life for him. Miz Carnation rebuffs Ralston, but after some begging she makes a deal with him to hear Haeckel's Tale. If he still wants his wife brought back to life after hearing it then she would do so. Ernst Haeckel (played by Derek Cecil)is a young medical professor whose obsession to conquer death mirrors that of a certain eccentric European scientist he so admires. Unlike his idol, Haeckel's attempt to use electricity to put the spark of life back into a corpse fails dramatically. He's soon investigating the rumor of a certain traveling necromancer who goes by the name of Montesquino (played by Joe Polito) who he thinks to be a fraud, but he soon finds out that Montesquino is all he says he is when Haeckel stumbles upon Wolfram (played by Stargate SG-1's own Maybourne, Tom McBeath) and his stunning young wife Elise (the drop-dead gorgeous Leela Savasta).Haeckel quickly lusts after the young Elise, but as Wolfram will later tell him as the story nears it's climax (in more ways than one), Elise cannot be satisfied by him or Haeckel. Her obsession with a dead husband she loves and cannot let go brings Haeckel to a scene that he cannot comprehend nor accept as something she truly wants. I must say that Leela Savasta's performance as the dead-obsessed Elise is only surpassed by Anna Falchi's own work as ""She"" in Dellamorte Dellamore. Leela's pretty much spending most of her screentime fully naked and writhing around in an orgy not typical of most horror movies. It's also in this orgy scene where we get the biggest Clive Barker feel to the story. Anyone how has read Barker earlier work knows the man can mix horror and sex like no other.The ending of the episode brings to it a slight twist with Miz Carnation being more than she says she is. This Masters of Horror episode is not the best of the lot, but it is one of the better looking ones in terms of cinematography and it's leads. It also doesn't have much in terms of genuine scares. The story gradually builds up the dreads and disturbing images but never anything that will put a genuine heart-stopping scare on the viewer. Like McNaughton's own foray into horror with Henry, Haeckel's Tale lets the story's own disturbing themes on obsession and the darker side of love put the horror in the story. It does have a nice gore-laden sequence courtesy of Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero and their KNB FX team.In the end, Haeckel's Tale is a very good episode which has its flaws like the rest of the Masters of Horror episodes. What sets it apart from the rest of the series entries is its unique Hammer Films look and the return of McNaughton back in the director's chair as a horror filmmaker. It's no Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, but Haeckel's Tale will have enough disturbing images to burn itself to its audiences' minds.",Masters of Horror - John Mcnaughton - Haeckel's Tale

209585,"Joan Crawford, with her impossibly-arched eyebrows and gargantuan shoulderpads, was a camp icon long before MOMMIE DEAREST even went before the cameras.  Thanks to Faye Dunaway's performance in the film, Joan Crawford rose to the position of camp's High Priestess, and fans wouldn't have it any other way.Joan Crawford's adopted daughter Christina began writing the book ""Mommie Dearest"" shortly before Joan's death and allowed her to read the drafts.  It was for this reason alone that Crawford completely cut Christina out of the will (though Christina manages to leave out this important fact in her many interviews and personal appearances).  The poison-filled tome did manage to destroy the reputation which Joan had carefully guarded and maintained throughout her professional life; but in recent years her films have gradually found their audience once again and Crawford is now looked upon as one of the leading lights of the classic cinema, as she should be.MOMMIE DEAREST recounts the early life of Christina Crawford, growing up as the daughter of the reigning Queen of Hollywood.  There is little doubt that Joan Crawford was a very demanding and strong woman, an alcoholic with deep-seated psychological phobias.  But this does not make her an abuser.In the film version of MOMMIE DEAREST, Faye Dunaway gives a very eerie recreation of Joan Crawford (which spans from 1939's ""Ice Follies of 1939"" to her final days).  Much has been made of the infamous ""NO WIRE HANGERS...EVEEEEER!!!"" scene, and Dunaway has that rare ability to capture much of Crawford's agonies.  Equally-strong is Mara Hobel, who gives a deeply affecting performance as the younger Christina.  Diana Scarwid is memorable as the older Christina.But it must be noted that so many incidents in the film were glossed-over in favour of Hollywood fantasy.  No one will really know what exactly happened in the private relationship of Joan and Christina, but reading between the lines (and being quite aware that much of the book was written with sheer hatred and blinding anger), it becomes very clear that Christina was a little brat who did everything she could to push her mother's buttons.MOMMIE DEAREST remains to this day a feast for the lovers of camp; from Faye Dunaway's one-line zingers, the outrageous clothes of Irene Sharaff, to the mealy-mouthed Christina played by Diana Scarwid.  This deserves it's place on the shelf next to ""Valley of the Dolls"" and ""Trog"".(Single-sided, dual-layer disc)",N/A

When no one's looking, he dumps the slimy stuff in a lady's purse without her knowing. When her phone, inside her purse, eventually rings--he panics.)Some parts are a bit slow, but if you hang to the end, you'll find a surprisingly tight plot. I love how they tied it all together at the end (and Willem Dafoe was a marvelous sport!)However, there was some cussing in the DVD, as well as scenes of faux war--including guns blazing.

394387,"This brilliant film about an aspiring comic who resorts to kidnapping, is a little known masterpiece by Martin Scorcese.The part DeNiro plays here is as different from Taxi Driver or Raging Bull as you can get, but he still shows why in the early 80's he was THE best actor to have in your movie. From what I have read DeNiro did a lot of preparation work (as always) for this movie, and it shows, he is never less than utterly convincing.There are some marvellous (though cringe-making) scenes in this film. Particularly when Pupkin (DeNiro) is trying to get to see Langford (Lewis). The receptionist tells Pupkin he's not in, so Pupkin just waits and waits. The cringe factor is like that in Alan Partridge, or perhaps The Office, except that you won't be laughing through this.I've not seen Jerry Lewis in any other films but thought both he and Sandra Bernhard gave fine performances.

Anyone who was alive during 9/11 has already had a lifetime overdose of news coverage of terrorist tragedy - I don't need a film to present the same.  The few shots that cut away from big band military music, flaming bodies and crying bystanders are straight from a bad, made-for-TV movie - Denzel gazing steely eyed at clues like grease smears under a bridge while mouthing soap opera'esque explanatory bomb specifics to the police.  And these few lines of awful dialogue only occur about half hour into the movie.  I'm serious, no one says a word for the first quarter of the film! Once again Hollywood cranks out another movie that lacks a plot or screenplay and has forgotten to be entertaining.  Not even the promise of staring at Denzel Washington for two hours could keep me awake.  The only entertaining moment is seeing Val Kilmer's beyond bloated face and neck appear on the screen and wondering how the neck of a 600 pound man could fit on the only marginally over weight Kilmer.  Bad Liposuction perhaps?  That's the only mystery worth pondering in Deja Vu.  Still lacking any semblance of a plot or more than five lines of dialogue, the movie starts showing close ups of burned and mutilated body parts, including severed children's hands.

While watching I kept thinking about how pathetic this era would seem to future historians looking back on the decade of ""terror"" - where every action film uses terrorists as the stock villain now replacing the Bolsheviks in the bathroom.  Deja Vu is not only dumb but out right pissed me off for trying so pathetically to manipulate emotions associated with the fear of terrorism.  The only thing I'm afraid of is how mainstream it has become to sell brainless propaganda as entertainment.",Deja Vu

1021411,"I picked this up at my local Best Buy's for $40, considering that this box set contains both full seasons of Magic Knight Rayearth.  In total, there are 13 discs with this set, Season 1 has 6 Discs (1 disc is full of Special Features).  Season 2 has 7 discs in it, all seven discs are of the show (No Special Features disc).  Ok, onto the synopsis of the show itself.The country of Cephiro is in grave danger and according to an ancient legend, in times of crisis such as these three girls from another world come to Cephiro and become the Legendary Magic Knights and save the world from destruction.Season 1 is the origin of the Magic Knights.  Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuzaki, Fuu Hououji are visiting Tokyo Tower when suddenly, the three of them hear a strange voice and see a strange bright light in the sky.  The three are instantly transported to the world of Cephiro where they quickly meet Master Mage Clef who informs them of their reason for being in Cephiro.  It seems that High Priest Segato has kidnapped and imprisoned the Pillar of Cephiro, Princess Emeraude, whose sole duty is to pray for the world of Cephiro in order to keep it safe.  However, the meeting is cut short when the group is attacked by Alcione (am unsure of the correct spelling) and High Priest Zagato manage to transform Master Mage Clef into stone.  Now, the three girls must fulfill their destiny by becoming the Legendary Magic Knights and saving the world of Cephiro from being destroyed.Season 2 picks up right after the events of Season 1.  The girls return are pulled back to the world of Cephiro, charged with saving it once again from an even stronger and powerful foes than in the first season.  The girls must once again, don the armor, the swords, and the magic that so served them in their battles in the first season.This show has it all, magic, swords, monsters, and even Mecha machines.  The battles are intense, there's even comedy, some romance, and great graphics.  The whole series is awesome, especially since you get almost 19 worth of televison for $40.  I've seen 12 and 13 episode animes that cost more.A couple of notes that I want to make.  First, I would've done this review a lot sooner, however, I had to return my first copy as I received a duplicate copy of the ""Learn"" disc in Season 2, when I returned it, all was well.  Second, I don't know if it's my DVD player, some interference or what, but sometimes while watching Season 2, it seemed like there was in fact interference on my DVD player, when I rewound my DVD to before the ""problem"" they weren't there after it played back through.  And Third, it seems that there's a strange echo in Season 2, Disc 6, Episode 3, not sure if it's just my copy or not.With that all out of the way, I must recommend this show, the characters are loveable, the battles are awesome, and you get a lot of episodes for a mere $40 (at least if you get it from Best Buy).  I'd definetly recommend this to all of my anime friends.***Edit.  There is one negative to the show.  Every episode starts off with a brief recap of what the show is pretty much about which tends to get rather annoying.",The World of Magic Knight Rayearth: TV Series Season 1 and Two

802224,"""Elephant"" attempts to be profound.  We follow long shots of students going through their day, developing film, eating in the cafeteria, etc.  There is a real mix of actors who make it seem very life-like.  However, we need to wade through a lot to get to the promised bang at the end.  The absence of an explanation for what motivates Alex to plan this is perhaps the only way it could be handled.  We see Alex lives in a house where his parents are like absentee landlords.  There appears to be little supervision or interaction.  Moreover, there does not seem to be much love.  When Alex, played by Alex Frost in his only film role I could find, showers with his friend Eric played by Eric Deulen, it seems like maybe at least the boys have found someone to whom they could relate.  However, Alex proves to be a master manipulator.  The scene at the end where his buddy shows up to report on all his kills and receives a bullet to the chest is chilling.  However, this school is strange.  There are empty halls.  Shots ring out and the instructor appears oblivious until he drags a dead student back into the room smearing a blood trail behind him.  I know that this subject is a difficult one.  Nevertheless, I found the film to lack sensitivity and certainly it lacked heroes.  Diane Keaton produced this Gus Van Sant-directed film.  Van Sant received a Best Director award and the film was honored with the Golden Palm.  It did not seem so stunningly brilliant to me, more plodding and awkward.

655371,"we've been hearing rumors of a Simpsons movie for years, and eagerly, but cautiously, awaiting it's release for just as long.I say cautiously because everyone knows the junkyard is littered with TV show movies that just couldn't make the transition to the big screen hour and a half. And cartoon TV shows are usually the worst for this.I was reading on-line once that Matt Groenig and the creators of ""The Simpsons"" were delaying making a film because they wanted to wait until they had an idea good enough to justify making the audience go to the theaters.Well, if true it is very idealistic of them, but I think they failed to meet their own criteria. It's not a bad Simpsons, but it's not anything spectacular either. It is essentially just an hour and a half long episode of ""The Simpsons"".I did catch myself laughing a lot during this movie, but I think  if you just take 3 episodes from the Golden Age of ""The Simpsons"" and tie them together, it would be a lot funnier than this film was. This film was funny, but if you're expecting something spectacular you're going to be disappointed.I also found myself squirming in my seat a little bit near the end of the movie.The plot wasn't bad, but it could have been better. For my money, it retread familiar ground too much. (Homer screws up, Marge looses her faith in him and the marriage hits a low point, Homer does something to redeem himself). Granted it's on a bigger scale than ever before this time, but the basic formula is something we've seen over and over again in many Simpsons episodes already.Like ""Star Wars"" or ""Harry Potter"" or any summer movie event with a huge following, this movie was bound to disappoint and be a victim of high expectations. If you haven't already seen it, go in with low expectations, and you should have a great time.",N/A
1069031,"Let me just start by saying i have never liked movies about being stranded on an island. Blue Lagoon, Castaway etc etc, i avoid those movies like the plague, why? Lets just say growing up in Chicago i have become used to urban enviroments and movies in general with a lot of stuff going on. How much can possibly go on when stranded on an island, fish? Swim away from sharks? Building a fire? Don't get me wrong, i like character development as much as the next person (never seen a lord of the flies movie but i read the book and did enjoy it, but thats the only stranded scenario i have ever gotten into) but i just couldnt buy the old grass huts and spear fishing cliche over and over again.So what made me start watching Lost, i hate to say that into the third season i saw a commerical with Evangeline Lily in it and thought to myself, a show with a girl that fine in it has to be at least decent, if anything maybe i could catch some rainy scenes with her in it. So i downloaded the season premiere of season 3, a tale of 2 cities. When i saw the airplane going down after the others (didnt know at the time) came out of their houses i was just blowned away. For one, i thought it was just about a deserted island, instead i get people walking out a neigborhood that looks like surburbia in any ol city. So i thought to myself after watching the episode only one thing.....""I have to get the first 2 seasons Now"".Now after being completely won over by the cast of lost for 2 seasons i jumped right back where i left off, the second episode of the 3rd season. Now i heard many reviews about how weak the first 6 episodes are. While it was nothing compared to the second half of the season, it was just basically giving a little insight into who the others really were. The whole dynamic between Jack and Julia is particularly fascinating, simply because Jack never truly falls for Julia like he has fallen for Kate, Julia however falls head over heels for Jack. The fact that they shared the most important bond (getting off the island) drew them closer together.I enjoyed the episode when Ben shows jack the footage of the world series with Boston winning and the Look on Jack's face is probably the most stunning/revealing Look on the entire run of the show, You feel Jack's Pain that he can't get home but he realizes the world is still going on and it fuels him to do whatever is neccesary. The season picks up like a runaway train with the return of Lost that came on at 10:00pm est.  Now, Lost is one of the only shows that can get away with coming on so late..10o'clock at night on the east coast, i am usually in bed by 9:30 and you want me to stay awake till 11:00pm. But you know what...i did it anyway, they could show this show at 3:00am and i would set my alarm  clock to watch this outstanding show.  Honestly, in my humble opinion their was not one weak episode in the whole season, even the episode ""expose"" which people seem to loathe for some reason i found enjoyable, sure not as much as others but the ending alone made a chill just go up my spine.Lost is like crack to me, if i miss an episode i am downloading it the next day just so i can watch it, i am addicted and i will be addicted until my friends get off that darn island, and when they do, thats when i'll be in tears because this show that has brought me so much entertainment will finally be over.....thank goodness for dvd's.",Lost: Season 3

968962,"Hyped as the first co-production of Bryan Singer (Director of X-Men) and Dean Devlin (producer and writer of Independence Day) this should be a sci-fi spectacular. Alas, while a satisfying enough diversion for a while, it does not tread any new ground, ideas, or benchmarks in sci-fi.The story revolves more around technobabble than character development, despite some fine acting from almost all involved. Sam Neill is a multi-millionaire shipping magnate who offers a huge sum to a disparate group of experts to solve the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle. As time goes by, it becomes clearer that his motivation is more personal than he at first admits, and that there is a time constraint, as things head from mystery to countdown to disaster.An interesting subplot revolves around the excellent Lou Diamond Phillips, who is one of the victims, experiencing alternate realities as a result of his encounter with the Triangle. Did I say alternate realities..? Yes, you'll have to get used to listening to theories on `exotic matter', `parallel universes', `ripples in space time', `government conspiracies' and `electromagnetic disturbances'.. however the end does tie things together - with the help of a substantial dose of belief suspension. In fact, the ending is just a little too neat and ideal to be truly satisfying. That said, there are plenty of interesting ideas here to keep this fresh enough to be worth viewing.The effects are just up to small screen standard, but never believable enough to make you forget they are special effects. However the acting is, for the most part, excellent, and it is this, particularly from Phillips and from Eric Stolz, that help us suspend belief to make this mini series work.Over the disc we get the three episodes, each just under 1  hours, plus some interview snippets with the principals and a making of documentary.Overall, at the price offered by Amazon, well worth a buy, as long as you do not keep too high expectations. Fine acting, good pitch of an idea, but not so impressive in execution of story.","Triangle, The"

Thus, the civil Court-house is the Bleak-house. We see the civil-lawyer-cartel is not interested in justice, but in making lots of money for themselves. The young man believes if he writes a clearer presentation, files another paper, then the Court will be just. We watch the young man's health ruined, his relationships ruined with his wife, children and friends. While the civil-lawyer-cartel gets richer. There is a humorous scene at the end, when the young man realizes he has been strung along.Mr. Dickens wrote Bleak House to expose the self-serving, cartel of civil-trial-lawyers, and lawyers in black-robes who deny the poor an unbiased hearing before a jury in civil-Court. This 2005 version, written by lawyers, shows the main character's home with dark furnishings, dimly lit only by candlelight, for a Bleak House to hide Mr. Dickens's true message.

397969,"Now I admit, I am very biased with this movie because my mother named me after the 1st film, so for me to be a fan of this movie is something of a no-brainer. I own both versions, and I really think each movie should be judged by its own merits. However, if I have to choose which I favor, it would have to be the 1995 re-make because I feel that it speaks more to my generation that the earlier version.Of course, Humphrey Bogart is the strong, silent type, and Audrey Hepburn is the epitome of elegance, and they played their roles in a way that was accurate and appropriate for 1954, but let's face it, Audrey's sort of elegance for many today is somewhat unattainable. I liked the way Julia Ormond interpreted Sabrina because while she is played as savvy, she is still somewhat vulnerable, and not afraid to be so. I also liked the way she brings out the vulnerability and tenderness in Linus ""the world's only living heart donor"" as played by Harrison Ford.A few other reasons why I appreciate the remake?The various characters were better developed in the 2d movie. In the original it was as though they were blending in with the furniture. Linus's admin just cracked me up with her dry humor. The mother was pretty funny at points, too. I also liked the fact that Elizabeth Tyson is played up more intelligently in the re-make than in the original...and that despite the temptation in the end, David honors his commitment to Elizabeth in the end. About the only ""airhead"" was the Angie Dickenson character, but even that role was humorous. I cracked up watching her be all flirty with Linus at the dinner.Recently, I had a chance to read the entire script from the original 1953 Samuel Taylor play entitled Sabrina Fair: A Woman Of The World. I discovered that the 1995 movie is actually closer to the script of the play than the 1954 movie.  In the original movie, there's no mention of the fact that Fairchild, the chauffer having become a millionaire over the years by listening into Larabee Sr.'s transactions, but the play and the remake do mention it. I feel that part is essential to the story as part of the issue in both movies was class distinction...albeit moreso in the former than in the latter.My only complaint? I used to have this movie in VHS, and that version included a video of Sting singing the song ""Moonlight.""  I was disappointed that the DVD did not include this beautiful song.",Sabrina VHS

I think not.When ever I think about this live to air concert from the glorious seventies, I am in awe of the preparedness of all concerned (Liza, Fosse, and a great team of dancers) to take such a risk, and I'm in even greater awe that they pulled it off so brilliantly.This was the Liza Minnelli we lucky baby boomers remember so clearly - at the peak of her powers, a world class great entertainer.The time it took to restore this film to pristine condition was six years,but it has been worth the wait.As others have so well listed the songs performed on Liza With A Z -let me just pick out some moments truly memorable for moi.How could anyone who saw the original show thirty something years ago EVER forget THAT RED DRESS !!

Its forty years old now, yet somehow the special effects still seem reasonable. In fact at the end I was quite surprised at just how good the effects still looked.Andrew Keir does a fine job portraying Quatermass. Keir was a Hammer regular and appeared in many British TV series over the years. His Quatermass is immensley frustrated by the military, who he has to work with most of the time. He and Col Breen (Julian Glover) really loath each other and never miss an opportunity to try and humilate each other. I was slightly less convinced by James Donald's performance as Dr Roney, he was just a little bit stilted.The story and screenplay by Nigel Kneale is intelligent Sci-fi, which although out-dated now, at least has a plausible side to it. Go back ten or more years earlier and watch a film like ""When Worlds Collide"" (which is a very good Sci-fi film btw) to see just how silly Sci-fi can get once science catches up.

1025758,"I kind of enjoyed this movie, but it was very predictable.  It was far fetched.  The snakes looked rather fake and seemed more aggressive than one would ever believe, even hyped up with pheromones sprayed on flowers in the plane to excite the snakes.  I noticed one kid's review, but I wouldn't take any kids to see this movie.  Not only are there some very gory scenes; there is also a semi-nude scene.  Shortly into the movie a guy is clubbed to death with a baseball bat and while you don't see it happen, you do see the splatter of blood coming out and all over the assailant.  Some kids are fascinated with snakes and probably wanted to see this movie, but it is not appropriate for children in any way.  Samuel Jackson is his usual charming self and was fun to watch.  Too many things here don't add up in this movie and it really takes a stretch of imagination to believe it.  The movie is so far out it is almost laughable.  I can't quite figure out who this movie was made for.  They could have done a much better job on the movie, but went too much overboard on many things.  Stuff just doesn't happen this way.

First-time directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck can't quite balance their spoof of the skating world with the ""inspirational"" story, the villains and the love interest, but Ferrell makes up for everything with his flawless delivery, both subtle and outrageous. He has by now established a bona-fide comic persona -- a deadpan channeling of the adolescent id -- that ranks him alongside Harry Langdon and the other great screen clowns.Note: It appears that Ferrell and Heder did a little of their own skating, but the very difficult stunts were apparently done by body doubles with the stars' faces digitally grafted on.",N/A

Their naivete soon turns to horror as they walk into the realties of war, shown in bloody detail in this movie.  When victory seems assured, some of the men are ordered to put up the American flag as a symbol of capturing the island.  A politician wants the original flag, so another one is put up in its place.  There is confusion, men are killed, and there is some uncertainty as to who raised the two flags.  One of the men is asked to name those who participated in the flag-raising and when he does so, they are whisked back to the US to help sell war bonds.  The war scenes are vivid and horrifying in their realty, but they are juxtaposed with a somewhat stereotypical depiction of the men returning to the US and feeling guilty about leaving their buddies behind and being honored as ""heroes"" while they feel that those who fell in the battle are the real heroes.  Exploitation, racism, and opportunism are all shown to be as ugly as the battle scenes themselves.  Although there are many strengths in this movie, the action switches back and forth from the battlefield to the US tour and sometimes causes confusion.  Also the viewer never gets to know most of the characters well enough to know and care about what happens to them.  This is an uneven movie, but it is intriguing nevertheless.",N/A

812657,"This is a long, unevenly directed story which really wants to be an epic romance and almost, but not quite succeeds.  It is undoubtedly beautiful.  The scenery both in Moscow and also in the scenes in Siberia is a suitably breathtaking stage for a tragic story of romance set against turn of the Century Russia.  Julia Ormond is also ravishing here, and her performance underpins the success of the movie.  Her Russian counterpart, the young Russian cadet Tolstoy (no relation to the author, as he frequently has to explain) with whom she falls in love when he stumbles into her train compartment, played by Oleg Menshikov, is less successful.  His performance lurches somewhat heavy handedly from slapstick clown to would be troubled young man with deep feelings.Richard Harris is wasted and gives an altogether over the top performance as the inventor of the titular machine - a steam driven contraption for chopping down the trees of Siberia, which he nicknames the barber of Siberia.  The would be clever part is that Tolstoy plays the barber of Seville in the officers school performance.  Robert Hrdy even crops up unexpectedly in one scene as an English language instructor.The direction goes to lengths in certain scenes to come across as epic and is often beautifully photographed and set up - to the point where it can feel TOO staged - as in the scene on the platform where the cadets looking for their colleague search for him in such a way as their search becomes a dance for the camera.  However the overall effect is pleasing enough as long as you can swallow the stageiness, mixed as it is with some truly un-stage-like milieus of Moscow and Siberia.The dual language here works well.  This does not feel like some euro film with too many cooks spoiling the broth - it is clearly a filmmakers vision (Nikita Mikhalkov), where English speaking actors speak English speaking roles and Russian actors the Russian roles, successfully giving the movie crossover appeal from the normal arthouse crowd.  In particular, it is a pleasure to see a movie showing this part of history showing the Russians of the time who supported the Tsar as patriots, and the officer cadre as being a chivalrous life.In summary I would have to say this IS a beautiful movie, worth watching - Julia Ormond is terrific, the music score is suitably melancholic, the scenery fantastic, and the story interesting - if a tad futile come the end.

While there's never once a sense or flavor of New York - this is pure Hollywood all the way - Scorsese's mixture of stylised settings and naturalistic drama goes beyond the traditional happy ending and takes what starts out a standard boy-meets-girl musical plotline into darker emotional territory. It may lose its way towards the and (partially due to the overlong Happy Endings number taking us away from the characters for too long), but it gets a lot more right than it gets wrong, and has a great use of color.

Despite what people point out as flaws, the movie continues to be the greatest done by Wayne and many others.  I'm just glad they got people who could act.PROS:1.  Stars John Wayne, Glen Campbell (the singer) and Kim Darby (the cutie).  That's a star right there.2.  The music is almost perfect.3.  The acting almost perfect.4.  Shot mostly outside--lots of scenery shots--beautiful.5.  Great idea--imagine that, the story is actually about the little girl, John Wayne just pitches in to help.  Carried out nicely.six.  The language they speak.  I've heard some complaints about this, and I'm not a linguist, but it seems like I remember hearing all the contractions we use nowadays like Can't, Don't, Shouldn't, Couldn't -- and the list goes on-- did not exist one hundred and twenty years ago.  I have heard they are all modern changes.  You notice when Kim D. is talking to the horse salesman she pronounces each word individually, and so does he.  I've heard that during the days of the pioneers this country was at its' most educated level--I've also heard the opposite--that the pioneer mothers would teach their kids reading, writing, and math on the long road out west.  What do I say...beats me, I wasn't there, so you'll have to decide.7.  Heroics at its finest.8.  Kim Darby.  I don't believe it possible for her to have done a better job of acting.  I do not know if this was her first movie or acting job but one thing is certain--she was an expert.  Watch her face and body language especially when she slid down the mountain side and met up with Cheney (I hope I spelled that right) the low life who murdered her papa.Watch her mouth as she is torn between crying and sneering at the murderer confronting her--it sounded authentic to me.  Great job!9.  The horse salesman, I couldn't have done it better myself even after seeing the movie.10 Glenn Campbell.  Regardless of what the reviewers and advertisment said, he did a great job.  Take the few last scenes of the movie.  Campbell has that well combed hair.  He's a Texas Ranger but probably one who stayed closer to the city--a lady's man.  Then take John Wayne, pot bellied, patch over one eye, burned out somewhat drunk.  Glenn and Kim are running back down the trail after John shoots it out with 'Lucky' Ned Pepper.  That guy jumps right out from the brush and whacks him with a rock.  This is what happens to a city guy who only occasionally goes out into the country.  Then John Wayne shows up, pistol in hand, spots the bad guy with the gun and 'Bam!' no more bad guy.  This is somebody who lived in the country everyday--their a little harder to sneak up on.  It is my opinion Glenn Campbell played his part perfectly--a Texas Ranger who is also a lady's man.11.  The two times John cussed I feel were called for.  That is extremely rare especially today.12.  The two actors in the survival shack?  Over acting?  No.  People who act like that in real life usually walk both sides of the law and light and darkness and can appear as either.  Hooper did great--I've met people like that--a true believer who turned bad once.13.  Lawyer Dagget?  I guess I spelled that correctly.  Just fine, all proper, dressed the part showing his success in non assuming cloths showing he was proper and reserved.14.  The funny moments are funny to anyone who is not jaded permanently.15.  Despite the occasional flaw in the lines it is okay.  It just adds flavor to it.16.  ""You think one on four's a dog fall?""?  I think it means ""You think one against four is easy?""""Hurray for the man from Texas, some bullie shot!""  Use to, when people stood up and cheered somebody, they would yell 'Well bullie for you!""""I never busted a cap on a woman or nobody much under sixteen, but it is enough for you to know I'll do what I have to do.""  Means either, bash her head in or-- long ago they used brass caps in their pistols.  You would load the revolver from the front of the cylinder and after you were finished you would put a small brass little 'cap' on the other side of the cylinder.  Kind of like a blasting cap or a 'cap' for a blank gun.--it could have meant shoot her.All in all, the movies' language such as its' funny moments are a sign of the times...back then it made sense to us.  It still does to me.  Sorry it does not to you.CONS:There is no downside to this movie.  The acting is there, the storyline is there, the fun is there, the scenery is there.  A little girl is in trouble, two world class heros ride to the rescue, who could stop them.So all in all, I can't say you don't know what you are talking about if you didn't like this movie, but I will say your judement in matters of what constitutes real art are in question.

It is animated and it's voice cast stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. An excellent and adorable re-telling, there are parts that could have been a little more explored or expanded.

It reminded me of how my art started when I was a kid...playing with the materials that were available in nature and just goofing around.

1005909,"Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" glimpses into the past and provides us a telling commentary on the present. It's a visually stunning adventure epic that even has a message at its core (although Gibson doesn't beat us over the head with it). Jaguar Paw and his people are attacked and kidnapped to be used as sacrifices for the Mayan gods. It seems that as they have strip mined their own land to build greater temples, they've also caused famine, disease and death to take hold as well. Paw must escape to save his pregnant wife and son who were left behind and are hiding before it is too late.The second half of the film reminded me quite a bit of both Cornell Wilde's ""The Naked Prey"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with its cat and mouse chase through the rain forest as Janguar Paw is pursued after he escapes. You should be aware that the film is in ancient Mayan with English, Spanish and French subtitles. The film received an ""R"" rating for violence probably deserved given the graphic nature of the first half and last third of the film.The film provides an interesting parallel for our modern world; the Mayans (like today) end up destroying much of their world in pursuit of building larger monuments to their greatness and living out their fantasy as the pinnacle of modern civilization. The result is famine, deforestation, disease and death.The sharp direction, performances, cinematography and music allows the viewer to overlook some of the minor flaws of the film such as the simple story.  He also clearly has an innate sense for the power of cinema--the image and he lets the image carry the story knowing, in a sense, that it makes up for the weaknesses of the story itself. Gibson's ecological parable has a corker of an ending that comes totally out of left field (in fact Gibson in his commentary states that the film was originally build around this conclusion which was meant as something of a joke. Surprisingly, that conclusion works very well indeed).The DVD looks and sounds stunning. While the extras are somewhat meager (only a short documentary on the making of the film, a deleted scene and a commentary track by co-writer/director/co-producer Gibson with co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia)they aren't fluff. The documentary shows the challenge that Gibson and his crew faced in building many of the massive sets, providing make up for a large group of people and working largely with non-actors.Hopefully a deluxe edition will be in the pipeline at some point with some historical featurettes/documentaries. While the film isn't 100% historical accurate, Gibson uses the trappings well and incorporates as much as he can into the film to give it a feeling of ""reality"". This is a well made, visually stunning film that deserved a far better outcome at the box office.Sure, this film is a variation on the noble savage theme again but Gibson does such a marvelous job with the material that I'm willing to overlook the cliches of the story itself. Gibson doesn't get preachy in his message but just lays it out there while allowing his film to do the speaking for him.",N/A

643982,"This is a highly entertaining and original movie which deserves to reach a wide audience.  Although in the fantasy / horror genre, its style will endear it to others, in the same way `The Matrix' did.However, this is no clean cut Matrix style movie - though similarly ambitious in story, this is down and dirty.  The world contains The Others, people who though mortal have gifts, whether sorceresses, witches, mediums, vampires or whatever.  At some point in their life they have to choose to be part of the army of Dark, or part of the army of Light.  Through a prologue which sets this up, oddly spoken in English and looking like it uses leftover armour from Lord of the Rings, we see the dark and the light have formed a truce.  This story follows the Night Watch - these are Others who are of the Light, but during the night they check their counterparts do not break the truce.  In particular, it follows one man who following a meeting with someone that looks suspiciously like a Russian version of The Oracle from The Matrix, makes choices which threaten to upset the whole balance and truce.Music, acting, directing and art direction are all uniquely Russian and yet in quality are the match of any current Hollywood film.  There are quibbles - the parallels to Ghostbusters plot are distracting - the yellow emergency vehicle for getting fast to paranormal events, the vortex around the skyscraper which becomes the focus of the climax. On the other hand, the originality makes up for this - the occasional striking use of CGI, the lack of perfect ending that Hollywood would have provided, and most especially the subtitles!  The subtitles are a star in their own right and make the movie even more worth watching - if you get the two disc set make sure you watch the theatrical version, which has subtitles on screen.  They are in colour, they jump about the screen, they appear and disappear in unexpected ways..This is in short an original and imaginative movie in both style and substance - forget the language barrier and embrace something new!

Now the murderer is back to continue on his deranged killing spree on Halloween night.There is a reason why this movie is voted one of the horror films of all time, it is truly creepy.  This is not set at some abandoned cabin or in some haunted graveyard, this is a nice typical small town where nothing ever goes wrong.As I said, this is the first of what we have come to know as the ""80's slasher flicks"" but unlike those films, there is almost no blood and the body count is relatively low.This is a must-have for any fan of the horror genre or for anyone who is looking for a good horror film.This version of the film includes a second disc with several documentaries with interviews of the stars and producers.",N/A

436871,"British director John Madden's well-done 1997 opus stars Dame Judi Dench as Queen Victoria, the woman of an era, and concentrates on an unlikely (and almost certainly platonic) relationship that arose during her darkest years, those that came in the time between Albert's passing in 1861 and before the resurgence of royal popularity after her Golden Jubilee in 1887.As Mrs. Brown opens, we are confronted with an emotionally-weakened Queen Victoria who is unlike the iconic figure of popular memory. Having retreated into depression and mourning, the seldom-seen Victoria's popularity is declining, and with it a vocal minority among her loyal subjects have begun to speak out about the relevance of a monarchy in a modern industrialized democracy. Though always a woman of duty, Victoria dwells in isolation, with one of her few contacts being the charming Conservative Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, well-portrayed here by Antony Sher, whose attempts to coax his queen back into London society meet with limited success.Into this predicament comes a Scotsman named John Brown, Victoria's personal servant and eventually her friend and confident during this time spent mostly in self-imposed exile at the royal estate at Balmoral. Brown, played here by the magnificently larger-than-life Billy Connolly, was a plain-spoken, rugged outdoorsman, whose loyalty and lack of formality led to a greater closeness with the queen than had existed with any man save the late Prince Albert. While as we see in this film, Victoria came to rely more and more on this rustic Scot, insiders at court, particularly the heir to the throne, Prince Edward, grew alarmed at the influence Brown might be exerting, and also speculated at the propriety of it all. As word leaked of the close bond shared by the sovereign and her servant, rumors percolated and some took the step of calling Victoria by the mocking title of ""Mrs. Brown"".John Madden is at his best directing pieces set in the past and nowhere is this more true than here. This movie utilizes an exceptionally talented cast and takes full advantage of its setting in the Scottish high country, and overall the mid-Victorian era is reproduced with a careful tidiness that lends a great deal of realism to a subject that is in many ways based on guesswork and prying speculation. Although Mrs. Brown lacks wide appeal and hasn't found its way onto many best-of film lists, it is a five-star production with very few noticeable flaws. I enjoyed seeing it in Boston when it first came out during its sadly limited theater run, and haven't regretted buying it on DVD. It's the kind of motion picture that should more often get made.",Mrs. Brown VHS

There's none of that hammy grandstanding that has marred her performance in her later work, such as that overwrought cemetery scene in Steel Magnolias.  Here she seems to be not only comfortable in the character's skin and predicament but appears to really be enjoying herself in the process, as does everyone else.  The film has this unpretentious vibe that works totally in its favor and everyone seems to be relaxed and in the mood to deliver the goods.  There are some extremely funny set pieces in this film and I've always considered it a much underrated little charmer, despite some silly scenes and less than inspired ideas.",Kiss Me Goodbye VHS

399207,"I had the great fortune to see the Olivier ""Othello"" twice at the Old Vic, once seated middle stalls, once seated in first row mezzanine. It was titanic . . . mythic, poetic, incredibly athletic, primal. Every muscle of his legs, arms and chest suggested a huge prowling panther; his feet were the paws of a great clawed cat, an uncaged magnificent wild beast moving over a savannah. There is nothing in Shakespearean stage history to equal the emotional physicality, operatic scope and Olympian power of Olivier's stage performance. I saw it happen not once, but twice: absolutely Himalayan each time, different each time. Nothing but legendary, thrilling Grand Opera performances by the likes of Chaliapin or Olivero match Olivier's display of ""fire from heaven.""As Ian McKellen does today with his world tour of ""King Lear,"" Olivier alternated ""Othello"" with Chekov ""comedy,"" in his case ""Uncle Vanya"" with Michael Redgrave, Joan Plowright, Max Adrian, etc.The most important thing to realize about this film, therefore, is that it in no way captures the actual theatrical experience which set the stage aflame in London and St. Petersburg in 1964. The camera is always too close. Always. Olivier in general, and his ""Othello"" in particular, needed to be seen on a stage at a distance of at least 30 feet to get the full scope and power of what he did. This filming is utterly unfair. We need many, many more sustained long shots; we need to see his legs and feet as he prowls, which is half the characterization; we need the resonance of a huge theater to get the operatic oratory Shakespeare composed for Burbage. Othello on stage is not spoken: he is sung. Just study the text. Listen to Verdi's incomparable ""Otello."" There is not one minute in this film that is fair or representative of what Olivier actually achieved theatrically. Yes, many of the gestures, the blocking, the delivery of lines are techniques he employed in his performance. His ""tricks."" But we see them from too close a vantage. They seem overdone, ham, over the top -- precisely because his interpretation and performance are scaled for an arena, not a camera.I have never understood why he approved the release of this film. Of all classical actors, Olivier knew the necessity to scale back, reinterpret and nuance a close-up filming of his acting. Remember Archie Rice? Why he didn't insist on distance and long shots, given the nature of his interpretation of Othello, is inexplicable. It is the worst disaster in filming a great stage performance that has ever been released. It requires alert and constant memory of his performances to ""know what he was doing"" as I watch the film. I have shared it with students of Shakespeare for years, and none of them sees what I KNOW is or was there. My memory is a far, far more honest representation of Olivier's characterization of Othello than can be seen in this film. I'm embarrassed by it, to the point of listening to the full length recording put out at the time rather than watching this desecration of arguably the most fiery, extraordinary physical stage performance of the 20th Century.All this said, however, TRY to see through the film to the performances. Piece out his imperfection with your thoughts. Use your imagination. Watch it as if at a distance. Add the torso, legs and especially the feet. Release his arms, gestures and faces from the screen into an arena. To watch this film and even comprehend it, let alone enjoy it, you simply must use your active imagination. If you have not been to great theater and opera all your life, you are going to have a tough time telling what the universal international acclaim is about. The only performance of a Shakespearean tragic hero that is comparable these days is McKellen's world tour of ""King Lear."" But there again, you have to be there in the theater to get it - at $3000 a ticket on the scalper's market. The DVD he will put out will not be the performance he is giving 160 times this year. He will never make the same mistake Olivier did, and try to ""capture"" the scope of his theatricality on film. Unlike Olivier, who was less than ordinarily intelligent, McKellen is a man with a mind who knows we expect Gandalf Redux at the movies. He will reinterpret, scale down, look for an entirely new vocabulary of gestures, looks, and vocal powers that match the medium. We who miss his stage performance miss his Lear - even if we get a truly wonderful DVD with Ian McKellen as Lear when the tour ends. Incidentally, Olivier failed continually in attempts at ""King Lear,"" whom he finally interpreted for DVD (in his dotage and his own words) as ""just an old fart.""Incidentally and in closing, the VHS and DVD release have been significantly altered by pan-and-scan from the original filming. The original film was shown at the National Theater in London, and though the vantage was far too close, there was indeed more widescreen and distance. I was at least satisfied after seeing the original film on the large screen in a great theater, even with its faults. But what we have in the video and DVD release is unconscionable. See if you don't agree, after watching this ruined treasure, that Frank Finlay's Iago is much more effective and real than Olivier's Othello. Then reflect that on stage together, Finlay was totally eclipsed, to the point where he received uniformly poor reviews for his ""colorless acting."" It's all a question of the medium. Live theater can be filmed perhaps, but never captured - especially as in this case where it films a proud and fearsome panther ranging over hundreds of miles as the actor walks dozens of feet.",Othello VHS
1028102,"Let me begin by saying that I was floored by Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" upon first viewing: the acting, the plot, and the originality in storytelling were exceptional.  I also enjoyed, to a lesser extent, ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs.""  ""The Village,"" however, was a bit of a disappointment.  While the cinematography and music were great, the atmosphere felt fake and the token surprise ending didn't deliver.  But even then, ""Lady in the Water"" makes that film look like ""Citizn Kane.""**Spoilers** I think what maddens me the most about this film is how the story unfolds as if it was being written while filming; as if Shyamalan was making it up as he went along.  Things like the little boy suddenly being able to see encrypted messages on cereal boxes, the man in the bathroom who supposedly has some part in the myth but whose part is never really explained or shown in action, the way Cleveland's emotional breakdown over his briefly mentioned murdered family somehow heals the nymph -- it's all so ridiculous.Furthermore, the myth itself coming from Korean ancestry is also ludicrous.  It would be more believable coming from, say, Norse mythology.  Not to mention, the Korean language, Hangul, doesn't even consist of sounds that are able to form words like ""narf"" and ""scrunt.""In short: As a made up bedtime story for your children, marginal.  As a big budget movie with hard work and long hours invested, awful.",N/A

738149,"Director Don Siegel directed several successful country westerns starring Clint Eastwood. His resume includes such movies as, Dirty Harry, Escape from Alcatraz, and Shootist. This is another western with a touch of romance and comedy; the highlight of the movie is Clint Eastwood as Hogan, is teamed with Shirley MacLaine as Sister Sara.Hogan while travelling in Mexico meets Sister Sara (her real profession is not so noble, will become clear later in the movie), under an unusual circumstance, while both traveling in the same direction. She is committed to helping Mexican revolutionaries fighting against the French, and Hogan has his eyes set on the riches hidden in the French garrison. It becomes an unholy alliance; an unwanted sidekick for a tough cowboy. Hogan's problem is, on one hand he has to protect Sara from the French soldiers looking for her, and on the other hand, he is not getting any in the ""pleasure"" department. The viewers can get a peek at Sara's real identity when she takes few puffs of Hogan's used cigars, and a shot of his whiskey. Finally, Hogan teams of with Mexican commander Col. Beltran (Manolo Fabregas), and come up with a detailed plan to attack the garrison. When they arrive at the garrison, Sara reveals that she belongs to the oldest profession on earth, which infuriates Hogan after his realization that Sara used him during a very ""frustrating"" journey.The movie has some drama when Hogan is injured by Indians, and Sara nurses the wound. At the end, the bad guys lose, and Hogan wins big time; two prizes at once, Sara and the riches of the garrison, and they ride off together, in fact this is one of my favorite scenes. My favorite quote is when Hogan tells Sara ""don't brother me,"" in a typical Clint Eastwood style, when she keeps calling him ""Brother Hogan.""

The spontaneity of them works, since the Marx Brothers are so outrageous themselves and because they started out in vaudeville, but the quality isn't great. Thankfully, they were written by Irving Berlin.The story is just as unimportant as the music. Groucho owns some land in Florida that he wants to get rid of; it just happens to have a hotel running on it. On it, there is romance and thievery. Kay Francis takes part in robbing Margaret Dumont of her jewels while Groucho attempts to romance them for their money. Harpo and Chico run amuck causing hilarious moments and antagonizing everyone in their path. One of the best choreographed scenes is the ""door scene"" where general madness ensues.

40206,"If you are looking for comparisons and don't mind a bit of a stretch, then you can consider ""Father Goose"" (1964) as another version of  ""Bringing Up Baby"".  In both Cary Grant gets to play a character experiencing a host of aggravations.  Leslie Caron's Catherine Frenau is not as zany as Hepburn's Susan, but still manages to irritate Grant for most of the film until he finally realizes that he is in love with her.  And instead of a leopard and a dog running amuck in rural Connecticut, ""Father Goose"" features seven schoolgirls of various nationalities running amuck on a Pacific island during WWII.Everything works pretty well in this film although Grant is not quite up to an American accent so there are several awkward moments with the script.  And the age difference makes the Grant-Caron romance unconvincing.  Fortunately the producers skate over the romantic elements.  In fact, the romance is treated so superficially that you wonder why they bothered to insert it into the story.  A similar romance got much the same treatment that year in ""My Fair Lady"".The film's real strength is the interaction between Grant and the seven schoolgirls as it manages a fair amount of believable characterization for each of them.  The initially silent Jenny (Sharyl Locke), tomboy Harry (Jennifer Berrington),  chronic complainer Anne (Pip Sparke),  Elizabeth (Stephanie Berrington) and her imaginary friend Gretchen, coming of age Christine (Venina Greenlaw), and the French twins (Laurelle and Nichole Felsette).  All have distinct personalities and it is obvious that Grant had a lot of fun working with each of them; so much so that he stayed in touch with them even after they grew up, married, and started their own families.Grant's Walter Eckland is an American drifter hoping the war will just pass him by; illustrated during the opening credits by Digby Wolfe singing ""Pass Me By"" as Eckland (with an unwanted hitchhiking Pelican) steers his boat into the harbor.  The war catches up with him there when the Harbor Master (Trevor Howard) tricks him into taking a coast-watching job until a replacement can be found.His job is reporting by radio any movements by Japanese planes and ships near his island station.  The reluctant recruit is rewarded with a bottle of whiskey (previously hidden somewhere on the island by the Royal Navy) each time one of his reports is confirmed.Walter seems to thrive on this assignment until he has to share his island with a French teacher Catherine Frenau (Leslie Caron) and seven young charges.  Miss Frenau hides the remaining whiskey bottles and the females take over Walter's hut.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",N/A
453545,"The Truman Show is one of those movies which takes an initiative, trying to be different and introspective. It is often labeled as a comedy, but I don't know if there is a real category that defines this film (it is part comedy, part drama, part ""reality"" show). However, I think one of the more important perspectives of this film is simply the morals projected: that free will and creativity make us who we are, that no one has the right to suspend our freedoms, and that diversity and change are natural in life and that attempts to take these away from individuals stifles one's ability to live. Truman has had ideas that everything in life isn't as perfect as it seems, and he is right. When he catches on to these, he truly begins to try to live, and push back the limits that have restrained him. Although the movie takes a very simplistic premise, the idea that Truman Burbank has been pretty much living a television show from birth, it works because its subject creates debate. Far too few films provoke any kind of reaction like this one; people should have an opinion about movies after they view them, and The Truman Show delivers in this perspective.One of the drawbacks is that some of the characters are a little bit too cut and dry. Take Christof, the director of the show, who is presented as an evil egoist who only wants ratings, and will not stop this idea of ""reality TV"" even when Truman is onto this idea. His character was a bit too simplistic. Not everything in this movie works, and sometimes the acting from characters is as phony as the world that Truman lives.It's a thought-provoking film though. It clearly makes one think about the possibilities and power that media sometimes has over individuals. How much do we really want to see and know about someone's life? What is ""crossing the line"" as far as personal space? The paparazzi could take a lesson from viewing this film. This movie was made before reality television really took off, but it really fits into this world because it presents the idea of taking away ""personal space"" and privacy. Truman's momentous life events are all a part of the American home, including the moment he ""lost"" his father, and the moment he regained his father. Many reality shows have individuals ""perform"" each episode and these individuals do this because they choose to. Truman Burbank's character is the very opposite of this spectrum; he doesn't have this choice, and takes measures to break from this.The concept of the movie is unique, and is certainly applicable in today's world. Definitely a movie to check out, then go back to later on!",N/A

But it's going to get four stars from me because, although low budget, it's a really great film.  A group of young delinquents is taken to an old hotel to help renovate it for use again, but little do they know there is a psychopathic killer already there.  The acing is shady and the story starts off a bit slow.  But once the action starts taking place the movie gets gory and over the top (he makes a girl eat her cell phone...AWESOME!).  Also, Kane did an excellent job of playing his mentally disturbed character.  This is Exactly what I want to see when I rent a horror flick like this.  Check this movie out if you just want to grab a bowl of popcorn and have some fun and a few gross-outs!  There is also about a five minute long mini-documentary of the story of Kane (the wrestler who stars in the movie).",N/A

In this one, the five pups find themselves in Alaska, where they are soon befriended by Shasta, a Husky pup, and his owner, a young boy named Adam. The boy has big dreams of becoming a sled dog racer, and if the Buddies can get him to the finish line they will be on their way back home. They turn to a wise old Husky for mentorship, but on the day of the race, the Buds unexpectedly find themselves on their own.

The B&W; 2:40-1 widescreen print is wonderful, rich blacks, nice midtones and so robust it looks like it was filmed yesterday...do not fear a thing from this transfer.When you have a book by Herman Melville and the production and direction in the hands of Peter Ustinov you have no worries about quality. This is one of histories great films. Ustinov appears as Captain Vere, along with a superb collection of English actors...and Melvyn Douglas, who was on holiday and talked into appearing as Danska. This comes out amusingly in DVD extra.The cast is superb, featuring, in his first role, Terence Stamp. He is the perfect choice of innocence to Robert Ryan's Claggart...talk about inspired casting! Wow!!!...everyone is one the same page and as if all this was not enough you get a wonderful voice over chat with Mr. Stamp and director / film buff Steven Soderbergh...which is fantastic! It doesn't go scene by scene but rather is a running commentary of life in the early 1960s and how films differed in this era, the power of the director etc. It's a very good commentary, excellent is more like it.Clearly Soderbergh and Stamp get on well, as witnessed by the under rated 1999 film The Limey, featuring both as director and star.A nearly perfect DVD of a nearly perfect film...a masterwork.",N/A

1062666,"This movie is a mixed bag if ever there was one. At times there are some truly funny moments found beneath the many layers of terrible writing and bad acting. Other times, you just want to hang your head in shame that you are even taking time out of your life to watch this movie. Unfortunately, the viewer is sent on a roller-coaster that is constantly bouncing back and forth between the two extremes.Although the title of this film is ""Epic Movie"", the truth is that the majority of the movies spoofed wouldn't be considered epic on any level. Nevertheless, the hodge podge of various movies, TV shows, and public figures that are spoofed in this film manage to come together in a barely cohesive mess that does entertain on some levels.The films and TV shows parodied include -- Chronicles of Narnia -- X-Men -- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Johnny Depp version) -- Da Vinci Code -- Nacho Libre -- Snakes on a Plane -- Borat -- A Christmas Story -- MTV Cribs -- Mission Impossible -- Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle -- Superman Returns -- Punk'd -- Harry Potter -- Pirates of the Carribean -- Star Wars -- Click -- Talladega Nights...the list is fairly endless.Some of these spoofs take up far more screen time than others, while some are barely noticable as they are merely a blip on the radar in the form of a small sight-gag, or a single line of dialogue. The movie even manages to squeeze in a few not-so-subtle insults to various celebrities, such as Paris Hilton and her ""That's Hot"" catch-phrase, Samuel L. Jackson and the massive internet buzz his movie ""Snakes on a Plane"" generated, causing a script re-write to include a specific line of dialogue, Mel Gibson's embarrassing arrest for a DUI, and even Kanye West's bizarre rant while doing a guest spot with Mike Meyers.Unfortunately, this movie fell incredibley flat, as did it's predecessorDate Movie (Unrated Edition), although I must say that I think they are making some steps in the right direction as far as improving. While ""Date Movie"" was a terrible, incohesive mess, ""Epic Movie"" manages to create a small semblence of cohesivness, and gives the illusion of not being a movie that looks like nothing but a bunch of badly written sketches that are strung together with little thought towards sequencing and plot development (whew -- that sentence was a mouthful).On a more positive note, there are *many* fun special features to be found on the unrated disc, including directors commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, an alternate ending, and a wide variety of mini-featurettes (you have to see it to believe it). There are even intriguing special features such as one titled ""How Gratuitous"" in which you watch the movie with this feature turned on, and whenever a little beaver icon pops up on the screen, you select the icon to watch additional gratuitous footage of your favorite hotties from the movie.As was the case with ""Date Movie"", this disc attempts to make up for the sub-par film by giving us a myriad of fun special features. If they put half as much effort into making the movie as they do in making the special features, then maybe it would recieve a better rating than 1, 2, or 3 stars (3 at the absolute most). I myself gave it 3 stars, because they really are trying to improve. I think the effort should be somewhat rewarded, even if the movie itself isn't really deserving of it.Bottom line, give it a try. You might hate it, you might like it, but you'll never know until you subject yourself to the roller-coaster ride.",N/A

There are some really nice DVD extras included with this film but I have yet to tackle all of them.  I'm too busy enjoying the actual film itself.  It's a wonderful tale not only for youngsters, but kids of thirty (like me) or more years as well.What's not to love about the film?  It has a high seas adventure and a boy who never wants to grow up.  It's got Tinkerbell who has become a force of her own as noted by her upcoming film.  It's got Indians, pirates, and a crocodile with a clock in his belly.  Of course, while most folks cheer on Peter Pan in his adventures, I'm sure most of us also long to see the wickedly fun Captain Hook have his day.  In all, it's as close to the perfect adventure as you can get.This film beckons for the days when we could play cowboys and Indians without the fear of offending anybody.  It comes from a time when our imaginations were allowed to run free.  It's childhood captured on celluloid, and it's worth every penny to purchase it.Highly recommended to anyone who has children or is a kid at heart.",N/A
709118,"The immensely talented Peter Ustinov displays his versatility not only producing, directing and acting in the notable film ""Billy Budd"" but also wrote the screenplay based on the Herman Melville short story.The setting is primarily aboard the H.M.S. Avenger in 1797 during one of the many wars between England and France.  Young Billy Budd played by a youthful Terence Stamp is impressed into the British Navy from an English merchant ship.  The pleasant easy going Budd immediately gains favor with the crew and the Avenger's captain the moral and dutiful Captain Vere played by Ustinov.  Despite his positive nature Budd runs afoul of cruel and sadistic Master of Arms, the blackhearted John Claggart, played superbly by star of the film Robert Ryan.  Veteran actor Melvyn Douglas playing voice of reason sailmaker Dansker represents the conscience of the crew as they respond to the power play aboard the ship.The film expertly emphasizes the clash between good and evil as Ryan and Stamp interract with Billy Budd innocently trying to win over Claggart.  The climax is reached as Ryan accuses Stamp of mutiny before the captain.  Stamp unable to defend himself due to a stammering problem lashes out and kills Ryan with a blow to the head.Ustinov now must uneviably decide the fate of the popular but unfortunate Budd as he is shackled by the military law he has sworn to abide by.",N/A
541134,"I know that remakes are often ill-received (and rightly so all too often), especially by loyalist to the original, but when I read comments on this specific remake that the oscar-winning outstanding make-up is laughable, the acting a joke (through all that make-up by top-notch actors), or that there is nothing original here, I can't help but wonder what film those folks were watching and I have to question the objectivity they may or may not have had going into this film and we all have a bias when entering a remake or a change to an established character.  I know that I had no intention of seeing, let alone liking the new James Bond, Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), but when I gave him and the film a chance, I was enormously surprised.  I think this film needs a second chance by those who so off-handly dismissed it.I agree 100% with Amazon's review and synopsis of this film.  This remake is rather inventive and original in it's own right and is far closer to the novel than the original.  The themes of racism, civil right, justice, love, and sacrifice are handled far more deeply and sincerely than the original film did although that is still an outstanding film in its own right.  Of course, the make-up in this remake is nothing less than astounding and believable by the famous Rick Bakker and completely outshines the original film.  The special effects are nothing great, but they are good.  The acting, the heart of this film in addition to its literate script, is terrific by those in the ape make-up as their voices, eyes, and gestures must mean more to resonate with the audience because of the heavy make-up used.  I do, however, agree with critics here regarding the casting of Mark Wahlberg who is rather pedestrian in this film.  He simply lacks charisma in this role and I found myself caring very little for him even as the hero in this film.An interesting twist in this film that admittedly annoyed loyalists to the original is that in this film all humans speak, which makes sense to me as why would we ""forget"" how to speak in the future when the apes take over.  While I always thought that was a silly aspect to the ape film series for none of us to talk in the future, I must admit that it does make the apes seems even crueler when they go after humans that speak.  I guess that only enhances the racism theme prevelant in all the ape films.  After all, we did, sadly enough, considered African slaves to be soul-less and a less form of humans and they were capable of speech too.  In fact, slaves owners only considered them just ""property"" and not even human.  Again, this concept of having all humans speak in this remake makes the film all the more thought-provoking.  In addition, the short-livedPlanet of the Apes: The Complete TV Seriesalso had all the humans speak.In conclusion, this is an extraordinary film and definitely not worthy of the very harsh criticism its recently received although everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.  I just think some need to give this film a second and real chance (minus the bias one may have for the original).  I highly recommend this film as an adventure, sci-fi tale, and message for its timely social commentaries.",N/A

96253,"I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, ""Attention K-Mart shoppers!"" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good.",N/A
1035518,"Okay, I'll weigh in on this one on a couple fronts. I haven't bought this item, nor do I plan on buying it. That brings me to the first front.Double-dipping. I hate studio double-dipping. For that reason I won't ever buy a ""preview"" or ""partial"" or ""single-disc volumatic"" set. I'm squarely in the camp that thing should be released complete or not at all. They did almost the same thing with the new Battlestar Galactica when they broke up the second season release into season 2.0 and 2.5 (releasing season 2.0 right after the first half season concluded and before the second half of the season started). This may be good for the die-hard DVD fan who wants everything ""right now"" and is willing to pay a premium for it. But to the rest of us it's double-dipping. What did we get for our money? Half a season's worth of episodes for the price we'd normally pay for a full season. That seems to be overkill on price and under-performance on price-to-content grounds.Sorry, didn't mean to get off track there. But I feel much the same way about the ""teaser"" release as I do about other ""partial season"" sets. It's maybe nice for those who are willing to pay extra to get a sneak peek or get it before everyone else. For the rest of us, it's double-dipping. It'll be on the season set, probably with more features, so why buy it?That said, I've watched the first few episodes on Broadcast TV, and it looks like this season will be in some regards a lot different from the first 5 seasons. It's moved into contemporary times, and deals with current issues of ""war-on-terror,"" free-speech, freedom-of-association, civil liberties, racial profiling, unjust imprisonment in ""detention centers"" (can we call them ""concentration camps?"") on religious/ethnic grounds. It looks like it'll be just as compelling and gritty, if no more so than previous seasons. So, I look forward to seeing the rest of the season play out. I'll probably wait until the complete season is released sometime late this year/early next year before buying it though. I won't encourage studios' double-dipping efforts.",24: Season 6 Premiere

996284,"For some reason while I was viewing this movie, I kept thinking of Hitchcock's *Rear Window*.  The plots between the two are nothing similar, it's just the paranoia that runs throughout the movie.*El Habitante Incierto* revolves around Felix who lives in a house too big for one person.  He's down because his girlfriend has left him, yet her things are still stored at his place.  They just have a really odd relationship.One stormy night (how cliche is that!), a stranger knocks on Felix' door to use the telephone.  Felix allows him in and leaves him alone for his phone call.  When he returns, the stranger is no longer there.  Did the stranger leave?  Or is he hiding in the house?  Felix, upon hearing strange noises, believes that the stranger is hiding in the house.Felix becomes so paranoid that he just cannot stay inside.  In an interesting twist, he becomes the stranger.Overall, it was a good classic type of suspense that Hitchcock fans would love to watch.  There are some parts, towards the end, that were left open.  Therefore, questions that I had throughout the movie were left unanswered.  Nonetheless, quite enjoyable.",The Uninvited Guest
1100164,"I HAD THE PRIVILEGE of seeing the hilarious ""Ratatouille"" at a sneak preview and now I find it just as fun on DVD! The fast-paced animated story of Remy, a little country rat who yearns for bigger things, then gets slammed by a rainstorm (along with his kin) into the sewers of Paris, is a sure winner IMHO.Not to give too much away, but the plot is the basic fish- (or in this case, rat-) out-of-water who goes to the city to make good but almost gets done in in the process. The characterizations and portraiture are vivid, the accents suitably Gallic (voiced mostly by Americans like Janeann Garofolo who took ""Franch"" accent lessons), the CGI is state-of-the-art and vividly and imaginatively used. Slapstick, witty dialogue and pacing make this nearly two-hour flick a joy all the way; even the littlest kids didn't get whiny during this one.An especial ""encore"" goes to Brad Garrett, whose deep bass tones rang out remarkably well as the spirit of a recently-deceased master chef who inspires our hero, Obi-Wan like. ""Ratatouille"" is a fine film -- at the risk of sounding like a shill, why not grab it at this bargain price [May 6, 2008]?  In fact I put ""Ratatouille"" in the same family-classic category as the (original) ""Toy Story"" and the (again original) ""Shrek."" Is a franchise born? Don't wait to find out.The DVD contains not only the movie-length cartoon but director's comments, the same animated short that began theatrical presentations, and (especially fun) a history of the world from the rats' point of view.

A crew of adventurers and a nerdy librarian head deep under the ocean to seek the lost city of Atlantis.Milo Thatch (nicely voiced by Michael J. Fox) lives in the shadow of his adventurous grandfather.  Michael is a sheltered librarian, but he has twinges of adventure.  Milo accepts the opportunity to accompany an expedition in search of Atlantis, though Milo requires a little persuasion.The expedition seems well equipped.  The leader of the expedition, Commander Rourke (voiced by James Garner) also seems quite competent, if a bit too enthusiastic.  Unfortunately, the expedition failed to prepare for the obstacles they would soon face, beginning with a giant creature (the kraken) guarding the entrance to an undersea cave.After the encounter with the creature the expedition is several reduced.  Fortunately Milo is quite knowledgeable and leads the remnants of the expedition to a great city.  Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the city was once great, because the people in the city seem relatively simple.  There is little technology evident and the people seem like simple farmers and fishermen.  Yet, Milo's books tell him that the city possesses great treasures and a great secret.Soon Milo finds himself at odds with Commander Rourke and other members of the crew as they reveal the real purpose they came to Atlantis.  Will Milo and the Atlanteans survive the catastrophe that is about to occur?  What happened to the technology that Atlantis supposedly has?  Will Milo and beautiful Atlantean Kida fall in love?  A viewer has many things to discover in this film!I like this movie though it has a number of issues.  The list of problems in the movie is lengthy and has been well covered in other places, so I will not repeat the list here.  Some of the problems are very evident; others require repeated watching to spot (unless you have reviewed the list of problems before watching).  I still like the movie in spite of the problems.I have always enjoyed Disney's adventure films (the Davy Crockett movies, ""Island at the Top of the World,"" etc.), but Disney has focused on fuzzy critters and movies aimed at pre-teen girls in recent years.  It is nice to see Disney return to its roots with a rousing adventure film.  Have fun with the mistakes in the movie and enjoy a bowl of popcorn while spotting them.

796386,"Babylon 5 was always intended to run for five seasons, no more, no less.  Series creator J. Michael Straczynski had a detailed plan for a story that would unfold over five years.  Unfortunately, during the fourth season, it was extremely doubtful that the fifth season would be made.  The PTEN network, which was distributing the show, was collapsing, and there were no other takers.As a result, Straczynski packed more story into season four (in case the series was cancelled), and when the last-minute intervention of TNT saved the show, there wasn't quite enough plot left over.  In addition, TNT insisted on cutting production time by two days per episode, which means that both cast and crew had to make do with fewer rehearsals, less time to shoot and edit.  It's not suprising that so many episodes have a flat, almost colorless feel to them.The real disaster, of course, was the loss of lead actress Claudia Christian.  While her replacement, Tracy Scoggins, surprised me, there's no time left to fully develop a new character, and Scoggins doesn't have the chance to grow into the role.  Even so, Christian's character was such an integral part of the series that her absence is palpable.In spite of these flaws, there are some good episodes, as Londo becomes Emperor (a mixed blessing, to be sure), and the saga of Centauri Prime comes to a close.  This plot line contains the only real drama in Season 5, which is more of a an epilogue than a continuation of the series.As a die-hard fan, I enjoyed Season 5 anyway, but it's true that the series could easily have ended with Season 4.",N/A
1055475,"There were several problems with this film.  The major ones being a terrible screenplay and an even worse cast.  I'm sure by now, many are sick of the comparsions to LOTR, but Peter Jackson set a standard for fantasy movies that is going to be hard to live up to.  Jackson did an excellent job of casting LOTR and writing the screenplay.  He kept true to the essence of the story.  This was not the case with Eragon.Eragon was almost completely miscast.  The characters of Brom, Arya, Murtagh, Galbatorix, and Durza (the Shade) were all wrong.  I thought the choice for Eragon was ok, but because of the poor script, he came off dull.  Djimon Hounsou was a good choice for Ajihad, but again, the terrible dialogue didn't show his talent.  Jeremy Irons as Brom was awful.  What's actually funny is that he probably would have been better cast as Galbatorix!  And then there are the ""monsters"" of the film, which were less than scary.  Urgals are fat, bald men?  And what the heck were the Ra'zac?  Again, here is where Jackson shines!  The Wraiths, Orcs, Goblins, and Uruk-hai of LOTR were all eerie, scary, and menacing to watch on screen.  Eragon's monsters are portrayed this way in the book, but Fangmeier could not convincingly translate them onto the big screen.While I didn't mind the changes that Jackson made to LOTR, and even found some of them to be more exciting than what really happened in the book, i.e. Helm's Deep (sorry LOTR fans); Fangmeier was not as adept at this.Overall, this movie was poorly made.  The  true essence of the plot was lost and the movie came off ""cheesy"" at times.  If there is going to be an adaptation of the sequel, Eldest, I will not mind at all if they completely change the cast and crew for that film!  My recommendation - wait for the dvd and after renting it decide if you think it's worth owning.",N/A
39335,"Okay. Bare with me. This movie can be judged from two different perspectives. If you watch the thing, expecting the usual. You'll love it.The characters are good and sympathetic. It is easy to get behind and root for Chrissie, played by the easy to watch Jordana Brewster. Of course Dean, Eric & Bailey are also along for the ill-fated ride, played by Taylor Handley, Matt Boner & Diora Baird respectively. Dean & Eric are two brothers on their way to Vietnam and have no idea their headed for an even worse hell in the plains of Texas.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series has had a long run of movies and has been kept alive with the likes of Dennis Hopper, R. Lee Ermey, Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Biel & now Jordana Brewster. All are filled with the same premise: unsuspecting victims drive down the wrong Texas road and encounter the Hewitt family. They are tortured, slaughtered, butchered, diced, eaten and rarely escape.So, with this installment we go back to the beginning. Who is leatherface? Why is he so fond of his chainsaw? Why does he love meat hooks? So, once this is explained... it's on with business as usual. Then, the movie falls right in line with the rest of the series.Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning isn't a bad movie. In fact, the suspense and bloodshed are top notch. You feel for the kids. You root for their success in getting away. You cringe at the heartlessness of the insane people who inhabit the Hewitt home. It's just a matter of... we've seen it before. I wanted more story.Did the movie have to play out like the Texas Chainsaw routine? Could there have been more of a story to tell? I mean, it was a short movie... a little over 90 minutes. Oh, maybe I'm jaded. I've just had it to the rimb with the stereotypical horror films. Just because it's a horror film, doesn't mean it can't have a brain. A twist or two? Maybe? Something more than just... are they gonna get away or not?I guess they do have the good sense to keep this series alive by casting the Jessica Biel's & the Jordana Brewster's of the world though.",N/A

1045470,"""Fast Food Nation"" is a superb reworking of Eric Schlosser's 2001 book by Schlosser and director Richard Linklater.Set mostly in and around the fictional town of Cody on the Mexican-American border, ""Fast Food Nation"" follows three story threads all linked by the fast food business.Mickey's burger chain has a problem - fecal matter in its burger patties -so it sends out its new marketing manager Don Henderson (Greg Kinnear) to find out what is going on at the meat packing plant that supplies all their patties.Uni-Globe Meat Packers employes many illegal Mexican immigrants. The immigrants are exploited and brutalised by a the company - treated little better than the animals processed at the plant. An evil supervisor at the factory Mike (Bobby Cannavale) drives around in a red pickup, treats the Mexicans with contempt, and coerces women staff members into sex - he is like the devil himself and the factory can be seen as a kind of hell for the animals and workers.Amber (Ashley Johnson) works on the counter at the Mickey's restaurant in Cody oblivious to the evils of the nearby meat-packing plant. Through some college friends and her uncle she is slowly awakened to the plight of the workers and animals, and prompted to take action.""Fast Food Nation"" features a number of brilliant cameos by Kris Kristofferson (rancher), Bruce Willis (tough company negotiator) and Ethan Hawke (Amber's uncle) but the entire cast is excellent. It also features a great score from ""The Friends of Dean Martinez"".""Fast Food Nation"" succeeds because - save for the evil supervisor Mike - it doesn't paint the good and bad guys in black and white.

414675,"Meatballs is the sincere story of a group of plucky, rebellious ""Counselors in Training"" (or CITs, as they are known) at Camp North Star who live and learn, and learn to live with each other and the Head Counselor known as ""Tripper"".  Unfortunately for them, ""Tripper"" is played by Bill Murray in his first starring role and he dominates the picture from the get-go.For those who didn't grow up watching this film, it can be broken down into two equations;Murray = FunnyNo Murray = Not So FunnyMurray is turned loose in several scenes, such as the campfire story, the ""wrestling"" with Roxanne, and most insanely the ""It Just Doesn't Matter"" speech.  To the point were you can see other actors crack up when Murray takes off. He simply takes the reigns of the movie and makes it a classic.The CITs who are the ""heart"" of the film are a likable lot, though none of them really stands out. They spend little time with the kiddies it seems and lots of time horsing around, so it must be a great life they have.Chris Makepeace is a real find as he's sympathetic without a trace of cuteness, which I thought was impossible for any young actor who's name is not Ron Howard.  He went on to star in ""My Bodyguard"".As for the ""Special Edition"" of the DVD itself, I was disappointed.  The movie is presented in faux-widescreen, which is to say full screen with the top & bottom chopped off with a black band to give the illusion of widescreen.  And the transfer itself is not half as good as the version I DVRed' on Showtime recently.  And the audio commentary by director Ivan Reitman & screenwriter Daneil Goldberg is pretty bad when they go off-track and can't remember simple details.  But the three documentary shorts are informative and well made.  While I expected Bill Murray to pass, it was nice to see ""Roxanne"" (Kelly Lynch), ""Spaz"" (Jack Blum), ""Fink"" (Keith Knight), & ""Rudy"" (Chris Makepeace) talk about the film.I dock this classic one star for the poor presentation and another star for the faux-widescreen of the film.  Given that, I expect the ""30th Anniversary Edition"" (no doubt set for 2009) to be superior in every way, too bad we have to wait a while for it.Tidbits:- The comic Chris Makepeace is reading when Tripper prepares for the overnight is the Marvel Two-In-One #50: Thing vs. Thing.  I know, I used to own it.- I understand where the nickname ""Hardware"" comes from, but what about ""Wheels""? And speaking of ""Wheels"", he's played by Todd Hoffman, the younger bother of Dustin Hoffman.- When Tripper burps out, ""Oh, really...really"" and puts his hand to his face, it's an homage to Jack Benny.- During the basketball game ""Fink"" takes a basketball to the back of his head and drops something which remains on the court.  Can't be a cell phone, probably a candy bar.- Tripper & Roxanne singing in the canoe is taken straight from a scene in the Marx Brothers' ""Horsefeathers"", although the song they sing is different.- Other than the CITs, we see three male counselors, but where are the female counselors?",N/A
288500,"This oft-filmed story is from a sentimental novel ""The Three Godfathers"" written by Peter B. Kyne. John Ford who had earlier made a silent version MARKED MEN (1919) with Harry Carey. Another remake THE THREE GODFATHERS (1936) was a highly acclaimed version directed by Richard Boleslawski. The 3 GODFATHERS (1948) reviewed here is noted for being Ford's first colour film and for its opening touching dedication to one of John Ford's early favourites: `To the memory of Harry Carey' -  `Bright star of the early Western Sky.'Three bank robbers Robert Marmaduke Hightower (John Wayne), Pedro `Pete' Roca Fuerte (Pedro Armend&aacute;riz) and William Kearney `The Abilene Kid' (Harry Carey Jr.) ride into the town of Welcome Arizona and rob the local bank on trying to make good their escape they hadn't reckoned on the tenacity of the marshal for the territory of Arizona Perley `Buck' Sweet (Ward Bond) and his deputy Curly (Hank Worden). Forming a posse they hop on a train, hoping to ambush the outlaws at Mojave Tanks. The three bad-men arrive just in time to see the train coming with the posse onboard. Waterless they decide to head north for Terrapin Tanks across a beautiful but hostile desert, hoping that the marshal would figure that they would head for the easier route to Apache Wells.On arrival at Terrapin Tanks they discover that a greenhorn settler, has left his heavily pregnant wife in a covered wagon and had destroyed the Tanks with dynamite whilst trying to find water. The mother (Mildred Natwick) dies shortly after giving birth to a baby boy, but not before naming the boy Robert William Pedro Hightower after the outlaws and making them Godfathers to her newborn son and further promising to take him to the town of New Jerusalem. Having earlier lost their horses they struggle on, following a Biblical like Star across the desert on foot desperately trying to fulfil their promise to a dying woman. Closing in on the three godfathers is the ever-persistent Marshal Sweet. Will they or wont they make it to New Jerusalem with the newborn boy-child?A great musical score by Richard Hageman with ""The Streets of Laredo"" filtering through as does once or twice a hint of the music from STAGECOACH (1939). Which is not surprising as Richard Hageman was responsible for that too! Nearly, if not all of the players here are Fords usual friends or favourites known affectionately as ""Ford's Rolling Stock"" many straight from Ford's previous film FORT APACHE (1948) all turning in good performances? Perhaps best of the lot was fittingly reserved for Harry Carey Jr. Perhaps it was one of Ford's little jokes or all that was available at the time but the baby boy in the film was obviously a girl (Amelia Yelda)!Not one of John Ford's best Westerns judged by his own very high standards but never-the-less a very enjoyable one at anytime, but perhaps best of all during the Christmas period!

1094028,"Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have had success with such collaborations as 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers', proving their skills, and yet in this strange amalgam of serious versus romantic versus dark comedy they have created a series of vignettes loosely tied together and named it YOU KILL ME.  The film as directed by John Dahl (aided by a superb cluster of fine actors) almost works despite itself, but in the end the audience is left wondering just what the purpose of the fragmented nature of the story was!The story begins in Buffalo, NY where the Irish gang is coercing the Chinese gang to join forces against the rapidly diminishing Polish gang. The head man for the Polish is Roman Krzeminski (Philip Baker Hall) aided by Stef Czyprynski (Marcus Thomas) both of whom rely on their hit man Frank Falenczyk (Ben Kingsley) - an aging alcoholic who lately has had too many missed or messy deaths because of his constant state of inebriation. Roman feels the pinch as Irish gang leader Edward O'Leary (Dennis Farina) escapes being snuffed by Frank, and Frank is sent to San Francisco to dry out and shape up.  In San Francisco, Frank is monitored by Dave (Bill Pullman) who finds Frank a job in a funeral home making up corpses and forces Frank into AA meetings. Gradually Frank gets sober, only to meet a woman Laurel (T&eacute;a Leoni) who is also a bit beaten by her own demons.  They form a fragile and odd relationship, each for some reason feeling the need to mutually open up - a new experience for both. Frank's AA sponsor Tom (Luke Wilson) adds to the growing away from alcohol process and also aids Frank in his attraction to Laurel. Lapses into booze occur and Frank finally feels he is a failure and returns to Buffalo to resume his 'work', but to his surprise, the changes that occurred in San Francisco follow him - in a good way.Even with the Cuisinart-blended fragments of a story, the cast is so strong that the film works.  Kingsley is convincing, Leoni is superb, and the rest of the ensemble rises to the occasion with the little screen time they are given.  And while the movie feels like a spoof on AA meetings and a spoof on organized crime and on funeral parlor secrets, in the end it seems like a fairly solid love story - albeit a weird one.  YOU KILL ME is an acquired taste.  Grady Harp, September 07",You Kill Me

The script just had a disjointed feel to it,  and I kept waiting for something to happen,  but it just meandered along.  It wasn't a mean-spirited movie,  which it could have been,  since some movie-makers seem to target the American south as the butt of many a cinematic joke.

976985,"""Hoodwinked,"" the story of famous Red Riding Hood retold in ""Rashomon"" style, may not impress you as the greatest animation, but it is definitely more entertaining than the works from bigger studios like ""Chicken Little."" Also, you may find some part of the film is similar to other animated films - how many times have we seen a fast-talking squirrel running around, for example - but other funnier characters and clever script will make up for that unoriginality.The film opens with the famous scene of the famous tale, where Red Riding Hood encounters a big bad wolf in her Grandma's house. But another character wielding an ace breaks into the room, which leads to the police investigation led by a frog inspector who is dressed and talks like characters from the 1930s crime suspense. The wacky humor and numerous pop culture references (including such hits from ""XXX"" to ""Kill Bill"") may not appeal to some viewers, but I enjoyed watching most part of them for what they are, the singing goat in particular. Interesting thing about the film is that it does not contain any gross-out gags. The humor of this fast-paced film is closer to that of Looney Toons.[CHARACTER DESIGNS] The animation characters of ""Hoodwinked"" may not be the ""prettiest"" ones that I have seen in recent years. They need more polishing up (and budget), especially when showing the human characters on screen. The facial expressions of Red and Grandma need to be more colorful, but I think this has something to do with the basic designs of them, not exactly the budget as some reviewers say. All they (filmmakers) need is experience, which I hope will be shown in their next feature.",N/A
398407,"Bear Island is one of those movies I want to like more for all its cheesiness. Barely released theatrically, cut heavily for home video and rarely shown on TV, it marked the end of the big screen Alistair MacLean goldmine (subsequent adaptations would be straight to cable) and, pretty much, the viability of most of the cast as leading players - Donald Sutherland, Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Widmark in particular would soon be relegated to the little leagues or supporting roles. At times it's like a bad accent competition, with Richard Widmark's German and Christopher Lee's Polish faring better than Vanessa Redgrave's Norwegian (""Yuust becorzz somwun haas givan anne ohrdoor?"") which at least adds a little variety to her usual flat delivery of dialog. Maybe Donald Sutherland should have tried one too because he spends huge chunks of the movie sounding bored stiff, not helped by being required to play one scene in red longjohns and trapper's cap.There's nothing new here: multinational UN climate change expedition to the Arctic is beset by mysterious deaths and accidents related to a fortune in Nazi gold in the ruins of a nearby U-boat pen, with all the predictable plot turns. This being Alistair MacLean, no-one is what they claim to be, and this being an adaptation of a novel virtually nothing bears any resemblance to what was on the printed page (much of which took place on the voyage to the island). Aside from one good `accidental' poisoning sequence the book was hardly one of MacLean's best efforts, so that's no great loss. It has its moments if you're in an undemanding mood - there's a memorably atmospheric shot of the ship passing the clifftop graveyard of German U-boat crews, while the U-boat pen set is genuinely impressive - and it's well photographed on some striking remote locations, but it's more filler than main course.",N/A

The animals fish-out-water jump into the suburban landscape allows the script to poke fun at many all- -too-human failings, especially when it comes to the large amount of food we all seem to consistently consume.I found myself literally crying at some scenes as the plot combined a nice combination of cartoon mayhem with adult whit.

608565,"This will be short, partly because, unlike I & II, III has at least a consistent story line. Mr. Lucas had to accomplish a certain number of things to link with the next film, so he could spend less time on tangents. One could point out that, as the possibility of ever-more-spectacular SFX becomes reality, the film depends too much on mere visual glitz--the opening battle being a good example, in that it is not clear to the viewer exactly why the battle is being fought (or who wins it, for that matter), but we must accept that Mr. Lucas and his coterie of animators and computer mavens have pretty well been seduced by the dark side of the... I mean, have reached the point where in their minds flashy things on the screen are a desirable substitute for story and acting.My chief objections are about the end of the film.First, we learn that Anakin joins the Sith primarily because he hopes to save Padme from death. But the Emperor tells him that this can only be done with additional research. (""If we work together, I know we can discover the secret."") But since Padme is supposed to die in childbirth, and is nine months pregnant, it does not seem that there is much time to get this research done, does it? Anakin might at that point have realized that Palpatine can actually do nothing to save his wife, and has been lying to him.Padme's death: entirely unconvincing. We are told she is in good health. We see that she is conscious and rational: she names her children. Then she dies. Of a broken heart? But would not the birth of two healthy children, and her maternal desire to raise them, keep her alive? Would she die and abandon them? Now, Padme's demise was actually caused by the plot of the film: since Luke S. has no living mother in Parts IV-VI, Mr. Lucas just had to get her out of the way. Why he chose to do so in so unconvincing a manner I don't know. But, then, screenwriting has not been his strong point in the last few years.""Hidden, safe, the children must be kept"" says guess who. Yes, fine. How shall we do this? Well, let's give the girl to Bail Organa, one of the most conspicuous figures in the Senate, one of three people nominated for Chancellor when Valorum was forced out. (Would not the sudden appearance of a baby girl in his family attract at least a tiny bit of attention? Adopted? Where is the paperwork?) As for the boy--""to Tatooine and his family send him"". (Ha! That will fool the Emperor--he'd never think of looking there.)George Lucas should have hired a writer--several writers. He simply no longer has the imagination and skill to write good scripts. He is mainly interested in spectacle and SFX (and marketing. Several times I almost wrote Lucre instead of Lucas.). He has been seduced by... oops, there I go again.(For a very entertaining, and somewhat harsher, review of this movie, look up the Nov. 21, 2005, 1-star review ""Yikes"" by mptesteroni.

1051123,"Not many people I know enjoyed the ABWH stuff as much as I did. Since I have never seen this and missed the first printing of this DVD, I was glad when they re-released this at a decent price. This 2  hour concert consists of the basic Yes faves (killer version of ""Close to the Edge"") and a nice selection of tunes from the ABWH album. The video footage is clear but the camera is not always where it should be and there are some cheesy video effects. The audio is decent but comes only with a stereo mix and there are no extra features - what a bummer.Anderson, as always, appears to be in a state of bliss, Bruford is armed with his electronic kit and seems to be enjoying most of the gig, Wakeman is surrounded by nine keyboards (not sure if he uses all of them) and is nearly flawless, and Howe is animated and looks happy. The other rarely seen musicians on this DVD are - Jeff Berlin (bass, vocals), Julian Colbeck (keys, vocals), and Milton McDonald (guitar, vocals).Overall this is an awesome souvenir of a brief moment in time and all ABWH fans, that don't already own this, should get this before it goes out of print again.FYI - Amazon's product description mentions this comes with a photo booklet and sleeve notes.

646461,"I didn't know what to expect from Black Snake Moan. Do you know how movies like Cold Mountain and Big Fish have their own way of dealing with time and traveling? Black Snake Moan has it's own way of mastering the sense of being in America. The music is great but what's even greater are the characters and their situations. After a long time have I seen a film that shows this much pride in being itself and it has the most awkward of storyline.Christina Ricci gives an absolute knockout performance. Although I dislike Samuel Jackson, the old-man showed me who's boss in this film. Excellent performances. Great emotion.Black Snake Moan is about a diseased girl beaten up black and blue starving from sex-addiction. An old alone black man somehow starts taking care of her. The screenplay is unpredictable and some scenes will give you the jitters.It has it's own sense of what I would call ""cringe humor"" but it's also a seriously good drama old man Eastwood would be proud of.Overall Rating - 8/10For people who liked this film, try watching ""Monster""",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

1049275,"Nancy Meyers' ""The Holiday"" has been seriously dissed by most of America's film critics--including one who suggested that any man who goes to see it should be forced to pay with a crucial part of his anatomy instead of money. ""The Holiday"" is indeed a prime example of what is condecendingly known as a ""chick flick,"" and it's not a movie you can make great claims for. But ""The Holiday"" succeeds outstandingly in living up to its title; it provides an audience with a two-hour vacation filled with charming, likable actors playing charming, likable characters. The movie is set during the Christmas holidays in which two women with man problems--Iris (Kate Winslet), an English journalist, and Amanda (Cameron Diaz), an L.A. producer of film trailers--meet over the Internet. On a whim, they decide to switch houses for Christmas; Amanda ends up in Iris's picture-postcard-pretty cottage in Surrey, Iris in Amanda's luxurious, gated mansion in Beverly Hills. There, they discover new romantic complications: Amanda with Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and Iris with a film composer named Miles (Jack Black). There's also a subplot about the friendship that develops between Iris and an elderly screenwriter played by the venerable Eli Wallach. Nothing that happens in the movie is at all original or consequential. I could even quibble about an inaccuracy or two in Meyers' screenplay (Cary Grant was from Bristol in Gloucestershire, not Surrey). But seeing ""The Holiday"" makes you feel happy and light of heart, which is all it sets out to do. While the film's appeal is necessarily greater for women, I also think most men will find this a more-than-serviceable date movie. Sometimes you want a movie that's rich, gooey and sweet, that contains no sharp edges and requires no sharp utensils for its consumption. In an increasingly abrasive world, the need for cinematic confections is greater than ever, and ""The Holiday"" fills that bill.",N/A
1080169,"This movie is absolutely hilarious from beginning to end. This has got to be Will Ferrell at his best. It's about 2 male figure skaters both enemies of one another and both hell bent on winning the gold medal. Will Ferrell plays Chaz Michael Michales the bad as* figure skater and most of the time drunk sex addict while Jon Heder plays Jimmy Macelroy the innocent sweet skater. After a certain mishap they are banned from male single figure skating forever and they take menial jobs somewhat related to skating. An obessive fan of Heder's character finds a way that he can still skate in couples skating. After they run into each other unexpectedly  Ferrell and Heder beginn a fight and Heders' former coach happens to be watching this and Tibo's it on TV and watches their fight in slow motion and notices the way they move as they fight that they can be good partners in male and male figure skating. Then they practice to get their moves perfect in some unusual ways. They still have a little competition between them and aren't the closest of friends yet. There is the other usual competition between them and two other skaters who will do anything to stop them and get to the top.  The way these two skate throughout the movie and the moves they make while skating and face grimaces are so funny. They make a great team with some of the funniest lines said between them. There are also cameos in the movie from the worlds most famous skaters, Nancy Kerrigan, Peggy Flemming, Dorothy Hamill, Brian Boitano, Scott Hamilton, and more. Will Ferrell's characters' drunkness and sex addict behaviour makes for even more laughs. I highly recommend this movie especially to Will Ferrell fans and Jon Heder is almost equally funny himself which I was amazed by so much.",N/A

As the song continues to play, they keep showing views of the school and the town. After the song is over Stella Johnson is in her house singing and dancing when her daughter Dee, comes home from school and can't even get in the front door.

Will helps Stella clean up her front yard and then later that night while Stella and Dee were eating someone throws a rock through the dining room window.

1099327,"With Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, director Tim Story attempts to step up the story a few notches by actually providing a real threat that our heroes have to thwart. This film is clearly light years ahead of its predecessor, which really isn't saying that much. The original Fantastic Four was just plain boring. Where the battle scene of the climax of that film was an exercise in the senseless, Rise of the Silver Surfer has the fate of the planet hanging in the balance.At less than 90 minutes, Surfer is short on time-time that could have been used for actually developing something better than the ""Reed and Sue are getting married, so nothing else matters"" subplot. Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue Storm is actually even more bland than before, which is quite an accomplishment.To my delight, the Thing (Michael Chiklis) actually has a stable relationship in this fim. His brooding in the last film over the most cardboard wife in film history was just tiresome. His girlfriend, Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington), is probably the strongest female role in the film, which doesn't speak well for Sue, the girl who's power is to make her invisible.Of course, Story finds time to have Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) take off his shirt during the film since he knows that the girls and gay boys need something to keep them interested. Sadly, it was probably the brightest point of the film.When the mysterious Silver Surfer comes in to dig monstrous holes into the earth, it spells certain doom. Even Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) steps up to help, even if he always has a trick up his villainous sleeve. The Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) gives a warning that ""all you know is at an end."" Alas, the movie didn't actually end until nearly an hour later.His warning was that Galactus was on its way to devour the earth. Since that's obviously a bad thing, our heroes actually have to postpone their wedding plans. Poor Sue. The inevitable final wedding is reminiscent of the one seen in Spaceballs. All it lacked was the priest saying, ""Good, you're married! Kiss her!""Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) can probably be awarded ""the dullest hero ever"" award, even though he can stretch himself like silly putty gone horribly wrong. It's a pity that his acting ability has the flexibility of a steel rod encased in concrete. Even still, Rise of the Silver Surfer is far better than its original.In the end, though, it's just not all that fantastic. Perhaps if we changed the name of the film to ""The Tepid Four, Arrival of that Naked Silver Dude,"" we might have a little more of a truthful title.",N/A

41911,"Yep, Wayne starts out in both these Republic offerings in a tophat! But, he soon trades them in for more conventional western wear. The DVD is a good quality transfer, with maybe just a momentary sound skip or two in each. No extras in the ""Dakota"" DVD, but a reading commentary included in the ""In Old California ""DVD.In the latter film, Wayne, an easterner pharmacist, arrives in a primitive Sacramento, just before the Gold Rush.(The fact that Sacramento didn't exist, except in the form of Sutter's Fort, before the Gold Rush, seems not to have bothered the script editor).  He chose this script because his father was a pharmacist. Wayne immediately gets on the bad side of the ""boss"" of Sacramento, Britt Dawson, by carrying his longtime girlfriend across a muddy street, despite her initial protests.  By the end of this event, we are pretty sure who she will eventually end up with. Wayne proceeds to become an ever  bigger thorn in Dawson's side and they have occasional altercations. Meanwhile, Wayne and a prim young society lady become engaged for marriage. Lacey keeps dropping hints that she might dump Dawson for Wayne, but the Duke plays dumb, as he doesn't want to further antagonize Dawson.  The story starts getting very fanciful when Wayne is saved from a hanging by a loudmouth who yells ""gold"".  Disgusted with both Dawson and Wayne, Lacey leaves and ends up in a gold camp with a typhoid epidemic. Wayne incredibly convinces fleeing prospectors to turn around and take his medicines to the gold fields(How many wagons does it take to transport a few boxes of medicines?!). Dawson's gang ambushes the wagon train to trade medicines for gold in the miner camps.(The fact that there were no useful medicines or vaccines for typhoid until the 20th century seems to have escaped the attention of the script editor).You can check out the film to see the details of how you know things are going to eventually turn out. The problematic developing relationship between Wayne's sidekick,Edgar Kennedy, and Lacey's maid,Patsy Kelly, while humorous at times, is merely distracting at other times. According to the production notes, ""The Spoilers"", which was made at nearly the same time, has a basically similar plot, involving a gold rush and Wayne caught between a heartless society lady and a dancehall girl with a heart of gold. This is a much better known film, made by another studio, withWayne getting only third billing!In ""Dakota"", many reviewers complain about Vera Ralston's acting. I thought this failed ice skating queen did an OK job playing her role. She is supposed to be the elegant daughter of an immigrant father who struck it rich in railroads. This explains her foreign accent and the fact that she is not like the sexy dancehall girls of Fargo. She is determined to call the shots when it comes to deciding where they will live, both near the beginning  and at the end of the film. When they run away from her disapproving father, Wayne tells her to buy tickets for CA, but she buys tickets for St. Paul. She knows her father's railroad is soon planning to build an extention to Fargo. She hopes to buy land from the farmers cheap and sell it to her father's railroad expensive. The trouble is Ward Bond and gang have the same idea. Bond assumes the railroad is coming to Fargo because he saw their surveyors. He also assumes that Wayne is a land buying agent for the railroad. Bond hammers out a contract with  most of the farmers whereby he gets their land if they can't repay his loan to help harvest and market their crops. He plans to burn their crop, a variation of a similar scene in ""The Westerner"", where the cattlemen are trying to burn out the sod busters. But, Wayne threatens to pressure the railroad to build to Grand Fork rather than Fargo, unless Bond signs over this contract with the farmers to Wayne(and thus presumably the railroad) for a big discount compared to what Bond was planning to sell the contract to the railroad for. Wayne then plans to share the profit with the farmers. But Bond hopes to steal this contract back from a deceased Wayne and delete the bit about Wayne being the new owner of the  contract. Bond then burns the wheat crop.

906026,"Karl Bohm is very old by the time he conducted this performance. During curtain calls, he was virtually escorted up the stage by Gruberova and Grist.For quite some time after Bohm, there weren't many dedicated conductors for Mozart's operas, the most dedicated one being Leopold Hager followed by Nicolas Harnoncourt of Austria.Edita Gruberova, who sang a lot under Harnoncourt, was just starting her career as a Mozartian in this production. Her Konstanz is very securely delivered, if not outright outstanding. And she was a real gem to watch - voluptuously beautiful in the lowcut cream satin dress.Francisco Araiza sang Belmonte with a bright, ardent tone that eclipsed second-rate interpretors like Ernst Haefliger before him. His voice hasn't yet grown harsh in this recording, and it is a real treat for the ears, even if his stagecraft was on the stiff side.Orth and Grist made a charming secondary pair.The star of this show, however, goes to Martti Talvela as the ominously difficult to sing Osmin.Talvela is such a joy to watch and a delight to hear - full of comedy and drama.  His duet with Reri Grist when he was bathing is outright hilarious and deathly funny. His later duet with Orth is another high light of the opera. Not to mention his final solo aria that demanded a real virtuoso's skill.This is a very respectable historical production, showing the singers in their prime, and the conductor's veteran skills as a seasoned Mozartian.

However, those who would like to purchase only one or two of the ""Lucy"" collections might want to avoid this offering and focus on the truly-great episodes in the series.As of this writing, I have watched the contents of every disk in the _I Love Lucy_ DVD collections. The show got better and better over the first three years and, in my opinion, the series hit its peak between 1954 and 1955, with the Hollywood episodes contained in Seasons 4 and 5. By this time, the _I Love Lucy_ television show was running like a well-oiled machine. Desi Arnaz' three-camera technique was perfected and would become the industry standard. Writers Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll, Jr. had developed a style that perfectly complemented Lucille Ball's ingenious comic timing, flare for slapstick and hilarious facial expressions. The show was fresh and alive with great gags and consistently-funny dialogue.It was in late 1954 that the Ricardos finally left their tiny New York brownstone apartment so that Ricky could do a screen test for ""Don Juan."" This hilarious epic went on for 27 episodes and began when Ricky came home with a brand new 1955 Pontiac convertible (180 horsepower with automatic transmission) that would transport him, Lucy, Fred and Ethyl to California. They stopped at a Cincinnati motel (this one had the levitating beds), Bent Fork, Tennessee (with Tennessee Ernie Ford and the Borden Twins singing 'Ricochet Romance', Amarillo, Texas and finally Albuquerque, New Mexico where Ethyl put on a solo singing act with the others doing outrageous comic pantomime routines behind her on stage. It was in these episodes that the first on-location scenes were shot.After reaching Hollywood, the Arnaz A-list provided a wealth of Hollywood talent including Aaron Spelling, Eve Arden, William Holden (Lucy's straight man when she does her hilarious putty-nose bit), Bobby (the Phillip Morris bellboy, played by Bob Jellison), Sheila MacRae, Mrs. William Holden, Mrs. Van Heflin, Mrs. Forest Tucker, Allan Ladd, Richard Carlson, Hedda Hopper, Cornel Wilde, Rock Hudson, Harpo Marx, Richard Widmark and John Wayne. Finally, an especially funny episode takes place on the train trip home. Lucy finds plenty of reasons to keep pulling the emergency brake cord -- tossing passengers all over the place -- and she finally ends up capturing a jewel thief.After the Hollywood episodes, the quality of the shows headed downhill as the Ricardos and the Mertzes took a trip to Europe in Season 5. Finally, the Ricardos and the Mertzes moved from New York City to Westport, Connecticut in Season 6, but even the addition of drum-virtuoso Little Ricky couldn't lift the lackluster scripts to the level of those from previous seasons. At the end of Season 6, the show was straining to be good, but the scripts were stale, the laughs were few and everyone was starting to look as tired and worn out as the half-hour show had become in its final year.At the end of Season 6, _I Love Lucy_ was ready for retirement, so it clearly didn't need to be expanded into an hour-long format. Although the hour-long format did produce two noteworthy episodes, ""The Celebrity Next Door"" (originally meant for Bette Davis, but later written to showcase a surprisingly-hilarious performance by Tallulah Bankhead) and ""Lucy Goes To Mexico"" (featuring great comedy and musical numbers from Maruice Chevalier), the overall series had become nothing more than a worn out retread of its former glory.Bottom Line: Others have already commented on the slapped-together look of the final _I Love Lucy_ collection and all of its missing footage. While the 13 episodes of Seasons 7, 8 and 9 aren't nearly as good as those from the _I Love Lucy_ heyday, they aren't all bad either. But the pace is sluggish, the gags are forced and the situations are unconvincing. These final episodes will primarily be of interest to Lucy fans who want to complete their collections. As for myself, I'm glad that I only rented them.",I Love Lucy - The Complete Seasons 7-9
198429,"For those of you unfamiliar with Jack Benny, one of the late, great kings of comedy at his best, I reccomend these episodes as your introduction to his style of humor.  For starters, Benny was one of the masters of the pregnant pause.  He could arouse eruptions of laughter without saying a word. All he had to do was look off to the side, at the unseen person, during an outrageous situation and one glance said a thousand words!  What's more, the running gag on all of his episodes was that the very frugal (to be diplomatic) Jack Benny was one of the greatest living violinists--if only in his mind.  This talent was showcased in many ways on the program (or, in as many ways that were possible!).  Whether he was playing duets with Liberace or serenading his audience in between interludes on the program, the squaks and out-of-key little songs that he produced from his instrument became an expected edition to his broad and tight-lipped style of comedy.  (In reality, Benny was a brilliant, classically trained musician who was anything but cheap.  Talk about playing against character!)The episodes on this tape feature a brilliant dance number with Jack Benny, George Burns and Bob Hope, dancing in a tribute to the broad comedy/music routines of Vaudeville, Dale Whitney and friends and the Beach Boys.  We also are introduced to Jack Benny's butler, ""Rochester"" (Eddie ""Rochester""--a great comedian).  In later years, this depiction of the devoted African-American manservant was viewed as a very racist and stereotypical representation of the relationship between Caucasians and African-Americans in the 1940s and 1950s.  Yet, in my eyes, Rochester (oftentimes) stole the show because he really didn't take any guff from Jack Benny or anyone else.  I think that you will really enjoy this program.  Though, the humor might seem dated to younger people, it's worth a look and it grows on you, over time.",Jack Benny Program VHS

159828,"Jennifer Aniston, Jay Mohr, Kevin Bacon, and others of note star in this delightful and consistently believable and interesting, twists and turns romantic-comedy/drama.  This flick is perhaps what made Ms. Aniston more a ""movie-star"" than her sit-com character, and it is easy to see how she made the leap.  Jenny not only plays a sexy and hot-to-trot corporate, rather shallow advertising exec-wannabe, but also a rather wholesome, down-to-earth, and deeply desiring (but not aware of it), ""good girl"" who only wants to be truly loved for who she really is.Jay Mohr is equally as good because in this film, he doesn't play his usual smarmy, over the top ""bad guy,"" but instead gives a low key but effective performance as a rather normal, photography and art loving, ""good guy,"" who eventually falls head over heels for Jennifer during an elaborate scheme by the latter to ""use"" Jay to further her corporate ambitions.Kevin Bacon is a fellow corporate riser who is both a good guy and a bad guy, good in that he eventually comes to see Jennifer as something more decent and deep than he thought, but bad so in the way he seems to use Jen in a casual sex way.  During the movie, all the characters behave as real people, and all evolve, leading to a very pleasing, linear story that pulls heavily on all of our most cynical strings where ""true love"" and values in life are concerned.Fast paced, with excellent performances and dialogue, and with pretty good insights into various NYC corporate characters and what makes them tick, this is one movie whose heart in the end is in the right place.  Somewhat a modern day twist on 1960's Best Picture ""The Apartment"" (one of my top ten all time films), there's a truly special blend of comedy and drama, and we generally ""care"" for everyone here in the end.  And the end, which I won't give away, is just about picture ""perfect.""While the film does have some confusing elements at times, and seems to swell at times with a bit overly done melodrama, almost everyting else about it is a series of well done, well scripted, well directed scenes, with some pretty good and timely music as well.

A view of the 60's counterculture that didn't even ring true then.  I also seem to recall that when I saw this in the 60's that Susan Clark points out the actual Coogan's Bluff (a real natural landmark in NY) to Eastwood's character during their scene above the Cloisters.  She tells a little story about it, tying it to the character's ""bluff"" about how tough he is.  If I am recalling correctly, that scene has been clumsily trimmed out on this DVD.  Note how in one shot Eastwood is wearing his hat, but in the very next one it is off.  At that point the dialogue appears to jump from one subject to an entirely different one.

1062204,"The following review is limited to THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER.The setting of this western is the town of Clearwater, TX (near Laredo), probably in the 1870's. The four sons of Katie Elder, who had not seen each other, or her, in years, come to her funeral. The eldest brother, John Elder (John Wayne), watches the funeral from a distance.Why are some of the townspeople anxious for John Elder, a gunslinger, to leave the town as soon as possible after the funeral? The brothers do not get straight answers as to how it was that their mother had recently lost her property, and begin to smell a rat. They also learn that their father had been murdered, but no one will say who was responsible.A woman who was a close friend of Katie Elder describes Mrs. Elder as a devout woman of character, and how disappointed she was in her four sons.  At least some of Katie Elder's sons mailed her letters and money, but had otherwise gone down the wrong paths in life. Mrs. Elder at least wanted one of them to go to college, but he balked. The woman did not want to discuss the murder of Mr. Elder because Katie Elder didn't want vengeance and further violence.Three of the brothers wanted to fulfill their mother's wishes that the remaining one go to college, but he continues to balk. John Elder keeps the pressure on.Sibling rivalry exists even in adulthood. At one time, all four brothers are involved in a brawl. At another time, they drag each other into a body of water.The conspiracy of silence about Mrs. Elder's property and her murdered husband begins to unravel despite the current owners' persistent efforts to have it stifled. In time, the current owners of Mrs. Elder's property frame the four sons for murder. The local law enforcement officials seem ready to believe the charge with no evidence, and a lynch mob surrounds the prison. There is a massive shootout, and three of the four brothers are wounded. Will any of these three survive? Will they be able to clear the Elder name of the murder charge?",The Sons of Katie Elder / The Shootist
287593,"Robert Taylor's favorite movie is also rumored to be one of Vivien's favorites--although at the time she was sorry that Laurence Olivier failed to get Taylor's role. (She was always seeking him as her screen partner!) But Taylor delivers the goods--great charm, presence and obviously respecting the choice assignment. As a matter of fact, he claimed afterwards that Roy was his favorite screen role.Vivien Leigh as Myra is a revelation--here she is fresh from Scarlett O'Hara and able to inhabit another character's skin with ease, back in her oh-so-British mode and looking as young and beautiful as ever. It's a pleasure that two such charismatic stars are still being seen in this--their finest moments on screen in one of the greatest tear-jerkers of the '40s.Special mention should be given to Lucille Watson for the way she plays the restaurant scene with Leigh at their first meeting--the mother-in-law getting the wrong impression from Leigh's reception. Nice performances by Sir C. Aubrey Smith, Virginia Field and Maria Ouspenskaya are major assets, as is the gorgeous B&W; photography.All of it is romantic, tender and charming--with an Anna Karenina-like ending after a surprising twist. For fans of Taylor and Leigh, it doesn't get any getter than this.It's easy to see why this was Vivien Leigh's favorite role too--even if she didn't get Larry as her co-star.

639698,"Everybody participating in this film probably never stood a chance. Incredibly gifted actors like Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellen were compelled to utter the most banal lines perhaps in their entire careers. I suspected the ending almost half way through the picture.  I have not read Dan Brown's book. The fact that the novel revolves around the possibility of a generation-to-generation conspiracy is inherently preposterous.  Real people rarely keep secrets. A large number never do. The very premise of The Da Vinci Code contradicts everything we know about human psychology. Homo sapiens do not remain loyal to a religious institution they know is premised upon lies. Moreover, they are especially unlikely to murder on its behalf.  I may be an ex-Catholic, but I refuse to indulge in blind hatred towards my former religious home. The Church of Rome deserves better than this slanderous attack.An earlier reviewer perspicaciously pointed out that ""The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip."" I can't do any better. This is a three and a half star film. Do you enjoy pure escapism? If so, you might find The Da Vinci Code worthy of a few hours of your limited life span.

It also showed nobility, courage, and all the benevolent make-belief values do-gooders colloquially say.

60078,"The opening speech by Lelaina (Winona Ryder) at the beginning sets an accurate mood for the rest of the film: optimism tinged with confusion and a lack of direction. In reality, the young adults in this film depict only a small slice of their generation, those who ""aren't interested in the counterculture that they [our parents] invented as if we did not see them disembowel their revolution for a pair of running shoes."" I may be a few years behind the generation portrayed in the film, but I'm not entirely without empathy for the restless plight of this group of slackers. Even so, the speech is a horrible oversimplification of the generation gap of the time, and the film is more easily digested if the core group of characters is seen as only one slice of a very large generation.There is a lot of similarity between Reality Bites and films likeGarden StateandHarold and Maude, sharing the same ennui and restlessness that seems insatiable and overwhelming. The striking difference, though, is Reality Bites' strong sense of friendship and community as a means of overcoming this ennui. I felt that if any of these characters were left entirely to himself, he would commit suicide, and the core group of friends is what saved them all.Unfortunately, their friendships are not enough to keep them from slipping into a dangerous selfishness and narcissism: Lelaina refuses for a while to find a paying job, and only seems to be attracted to Troy (Ethan Hawke) because of the emotions he conjures up in her; Troy, even after saying that she is the only woman he could commit to, says, ""You can't navigate me, I might do mean things, and I might hurt you and I might run away without your permission""; Vickie (Janeane Garofalo) is addicted to sex but hates the thought of a lasting relationship; and Sammy (Steve Zahn) is full of wounded pride. Michael (Ben Stiller) is intellectually shallow, but he seems to be the only person with any emotional maturity, and he easily sees through Troy's snobby attitude.ENDING SPOILERS: The film ends with a romance between Lelaina and Troy that seems destined to end badly if Troy doesn't wise up and accept the criticism that's been levelled at him. There's a part of me that cheered for him, but a larger part that wanted to smack him in the face until he wised up and applied for grad school. The problem with these kids is that they are immature, and have no ideal of maturity to attain to. Their parents (of the rebellious 60s generation) rejected their own parents' ideas of maturity, and so their own children have very little left to work with. Reality Bites is more of a romantic tragedy than a romantic comedy, even though it seems to turn out well in the end. I really wanted the characters to find something better to build their lives on, but when the credits rolled I was afraid they would just keep repeating their mistakes for the rest of their lives.For what it's worth, the acting and directing are quite good, though not great. I got a kick out of seeing so many big-name actors at a younger age. Ben Stiller's direction is good, and not as manic as what he later did inZoolander. Unfortunately there aren't any special features except production notes and a forgettable trailer.",Reality Bites
998099,"Here's the set-up for HUMKO DEEWANA KAR GAYE (Love Connects): Aditya (Akshay Kumar) is a car engineer and test driver for an auto company in India. He's engaged to Sonia (Bipasha Basu), a somewhat cold, very career oriented fashion designer. Aditya, or Adi, is a sentimental fella, Sonia is eminently unromantic. After several revealing conversations, it quietly dawns on Adi that he and Sonia don't seem to want the same things in life, and he begins to have bad vibes about their impending nuptials.After their engagement party, Adi and Sonia part ways temporarily for business reasons. She, to work in Paris; Adi, newly promoted, is reassigned to Canada. There, he meets Jia (Katrina Kaif) and is instantly smitten. The next few days or weeks, they continue to accidentally bump into each other. Eventually, they begin hanging out, and there's an obvious spark there. But Jia is herself engaged, to a wealthy, workaholic businessman who barely pays attention to her. So, Adi and Jia end up spending even more time together and, yup, they Fall in Love. But, still, both being already engaged, they try to ""do the right thing."" And, then, because, it would've been all too simple and practical for them to openly declare their love and break off their engagements, the script comes up with a plot contrivance to tear them apart. Still, the ending's pretty obvious and inevitable, but the getting there is predictably rife with tears, stoic suffering, crazy melodrama, and an outrageous coincidence. But, hey, it's all par for the course in Bollywood.If you're familiar with Bollywood offerings, then there won't be anything new here for you. The story delves into Bollywood's favorite theme, that of all-consuming love versus sacrifice and obligation. HUMKO DEEWANA KAR GAYE, released in 2006, is an average soaper made better by the chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif. You easily buy into their friendship which turns into mutual attraction which then becomes love. Half British and a model-turned-actress, Katrina Kaif is a natural beauty, graceful and unaffected. Still fairly new to the acting biz, she isn't really challenged here, acting-wise, but she holds her own with the veteran Kumar. Her Hindi lines, however, are dubbed. Apparently, people at the top had doubts about her proficiency with the language. Akshay, as Aditya, immediately gets you on his side with his easy going charisma. And he's got that wistful, heartbroken look down to a T. They make a good pair, and they're even better in their later re-teaming in 2007'sNamastey London DVD. Anil Kapoor, who doesn't show up until halfway thru the film, brings his patented intensity as Jia's controlling fiance. Bipasha Basu does okay with her supporting role of Aditya's all-work-and-no-play fiancee.The negatives? Well, with the Bollywood assembly line putting out a gazillion movies a year, originality is hard to come by. No surprise, then, that this film piggybacks NOTTING HILL in several scenes and CRASH in one scene. Also, the car rally sequence embarasses itself by inserting grainy and pretty obvious clips of racing stock footage. But, discounting the movie's climax, the most superduperovermelodramatic moment has to be when a hysterical woman bogarts a microphone on a Canadian football field in front of thousands of fans to beg her husband's forgiveness. Again, that's Bollywood. Basically, when you sit down to watch a Bollywood flick, you've got to come with the proper frame of mind and accept certain things at face value (the over-the-top dramatics; the unabashed romance; at times, the crude humor; the tendency for coincidences; and the song and dance acts). These films are definitely ballparks away from the typical and more ""sophisticated"" Hollywood product. But, if you get hooked, brother, you GET hooked! I buy a lot of dvds and, at this stage, half of my purchases are of the Bollywood persuasion.By the way, there's a heapload of musical numbers here. However, most of the songs tend to blend into each other and are mostly unmemorable, and I only sat thru 'em because most featured Katrina. The more entertaining ones are ""Fanah"" and ""For Your Eyes Only."" Sad to say, but the best song may have been the briefly played tango ""Santa Maria (Del Buen Ayre)"" by the awesome Go Tan Project. To cap off this three-and-a-half-starred dvd, there's a ho-hum ""Making Of"" featurette (21 minutes long) and a deleted song in the Special Features department.And if you do see HUMKO DEEWANA KAR GAYE and you think that Katrina and Akshay are good together, then, trust me, you'll be blown away by their sizzling chemistry in NAMASTEY LONDON.",Humko Deewana Kar Gaye anglais

1040582,"Ok.  I was skeptical about buying this dvd.  I was the one who trashed her first video because of horrible music.  I threw that dvd in the garbage.  This dvd is actually good, music included.Setting:  The same studio and same dancers as in the Dancers workout video. The dancers wear sneakers or jazz shoes.  I did it barefoot.  Works best on hard wood floorsMusic:  Smooth jazz with a definite beat.  You can actually groove to the music, sort of. Mind you it's not hip shaking music but it's better than that generic Kenny G stuff she used in her last dvd.Choreography: There is a 60 minute and 30 minute workout.  The longer of the two goes over each step over and over again.  The shorter workout goes over the steps quickly and ends with 1 run through of all the steps.The movement is jazzy, no ballet here.  Some leaps, turns, chasses, large leg movements.  She goes over each step many many times.  She does the routine 2x at the end.  My only minor complaint is so what happens after you learn the routine.  You have to go through the whole class again learning the steps.  She should have added a performance section where you can go through the routines as many times as you want until you break a sweat. One solution I found is that if you are watching this dvd on your computer, the full routine is chapter 21 (60 minute) chapter 25 (30 minute), on media player, and you can just repeat the chapters as many times as you want.  On the Broadway dance dvds, they have performance, step by step and work it sections. That way once you learn the routine, you can just go to the other sections and do it x times.Also, there is no warm-up, stretching or cool down. The moves are fast but doable.  I got 95% of it at the tempo, the first time around.  As you learn the steps, you can make the movement bigger.Overall:  Will I do this again? Yes but I don't know for how long.  I have been doing Soul Sweat for 3 months and I am still not tired of it.  That is because it's a workout instead of learning a routine and the real workout at the end.  I can see myself getting bored with the learning part after I already know the steps. I could use another dvd to warm-up and just go to the performance chapters and to do the routine xtimes, but that could get boring too.",Dance For Weight Loss

259365,"The colossal failure of ""Cruising"" in 1980 should have been easy to predict. When you make a story about extreme taboo topics (Gay SM murders) and couple it with a bizarre, disjointed script, then outright refuse to make a linear story out of it (I could never figure out why the killer always seemed to be a different person with the same creepy voice), then you arrive with a film that hardly anyone in 1980 would sit through.Ironically enough, one of the most controversial points to the movie now seems almost nostalgic. The seedy SM underground bars like The Cellblock or The Anvil that used to inhabit lower Manhattan's Meat Packing district are a memory now, replaced by nightclubs, condos, yuppies and the locations of a bunch of ""Sex in the City"" shoots. The notorious Lure Bar, the final and long gone holdout of this era, was even used as a ""Sex in the City"" backdrop - with little or no controversy attached. How things have changed.That makes the ""shocking"" hyper-sexuality of the bar scenes somewhat bemusing. Yes, in the ""Boogie Nights"" mania of the late 70's, prior to AIDS, skyrocketing property values and Rudy Giuliani, these playspaces and these activities did happen. It was underground, wild, crazy...and as William Friedkin saw it, a perfect backdrop for a crime mystery. Al Pacino (who has professed his distaste for the final cut of ""Cruising"" and is conspicuous in his absence from the DVD extras) was keen on taking a part that would be unconventional and nonconformist. So he donned a leather jacket and took the role of Steve Burns, a young undercover cop who fits a ""common victim"" profile.Thus begins a peculiar game of cat and mouse, with Pacino trying to pass as a gay leather daddy and showing all the signs of a conflict with his inner closet. Which, in the bizarre ending to this movie, is left a hanging question...especially with the little piece of business concerning Karen Allen. There are some bits of unintended humor, like when Powers Boothe attempts to explain the Hankie Code to Pacino and when an irritated bar patron snaps at Pacino about flagging the wrong color. But for the most part, the focus on seediness and the disconnected pacing of the script keep most of ""Cruising"" at a level where the suspense is at a minimum.In fact, the most revealing thing about this ""deluxe"" DVD (hard to define it as such, since there has never been a ""basic"" edition) is the pair of featurettes. In ""The History of Cruising"" and ""Exorcising Cruising,"" Friedkin and others dissect what they were trying to accomplish with ""Cruising"" and why they didn't look at it as a gay movie. They also partially explain the ambiguity with the killer's many faces/one voice trick (giving it an almost horror/supernatural bent, and consideringThe Exorcist, hardly a stretch). A former detective who was a consultant for the movie explains the presence of the musclebound cop in the jock-strap, among other plot points. The interviews with minor cast members almost 30 years later are interesting as well.The features (in particular, ""Exorcizing Cruising"") also address the controversy. While I can see the point that there was a dearth of gay characters in the movies and therefore a gay serial killer made lots of folks virulently uneasy, I was personally more insulted byThe Boys in the Bandthan ""Cruising."" Even with the backdrop a serial killer movie, the men in the bar scenes are looking like they are hitting the bars because they belong there and are enjoying themselves; as opposed to the bitter, regretful losers of TBITB cast of closet queens.What the commentaries don't address is why ""Cruising,"" which is a dynamite movie for atmosphere and grit, was ultimately such an incoherent mess. There's a great soundtrack featuring The Germs, Mink DeVille and John Hiatt when he was punky, a twist from the usual disco-drenched music of any movie tagged as ""gay."" And finally, there is Pacino. Looking for all the world like a damaged and conflicted man, the ambiguity of the final third of ""Cruising"" (Is he gay or not? Is Burns maybe a killer, too? Who is that leatherman going into the bar at the end?) made for an unsatisfying finale. More a curiosity now than a controversy, ""Cruising"" is now a strange look into a time long passed.Incidentally, given the notorious bent to ""Cruising's"" history, it is interesting to think about some of the movies after that bear a resemblance.Hard,8MMand even modern horror movies likeHostelor theSawmovies owe a debt to ""Cruising.""",Cruising VHS
340864,"this is a fantastic movie so vividly and realistically made. you have to watch it with the 'stalingrad' and 'el alamein' to complete such genre in different angle from different soldiers of the three nations that started the 2nd world war, winning at first, losing in the end.  don't want to get into the details like writing a book report, but there's some afterthoughts here:when you were winning the war, you've got everything: you'd be well fed with good food, wine, medicine, women....anything you won over and from the losing enemies. when you were losing the war, you'd have ended up with nothing to eat, even without water to drink, no medicine or medications. hunger, starvation, amputation, rotten wounds, high fever, dying were what you'd get. yes, winners took all. if you are winning, then you've got the best logistic system organized to serve the winning soldiers, so you'd have halliburton, blackwater and other logistic contractors or subcontractors to serve you, even take care of your laundry. and you're still complaining for those services paid for by the mimed tax payers?",N/A
1070030,"It is my belief that superheroes are dark entities.  Let me explain further.  Over the course of many decades, Hollywood has attempted to grapple the popularity of comic book heroines by releasing big studio releases based on what they have seen.  It has been the opinion of many that these executives see color on the page, and immediately believe that the color is what has to translate onto the screen.  There have been countless examples of this happening in cinema, take the most recent ""Ghost Rider"", or ""Batman & Robin"" or even the debacle of the final X-Men film.  To bring it full circle, the reason that these films have not been successful, and why those smaller films seem to understand better the choices of the hero (i.e. why was ""The Punisher"" panned) and bring the grittiness to the surface.  It is when a director sees the hero as a fallen angel, someone who is just as dark inside as the villains that they fight (i.e. see the most recent ""Batman Returns""), that I believe they understand the printed page.  An example of a failure on both ends is the most recent direct-to-video release of the popular 90s comic disaster, the Death of Superman.  It stunned the world, killed the hero we believed couldn't die, and slowly and surely reconstructed the mythology of Superman.  This animated film destroys whatever soul was remaining within this story.  It takes creative risks, destroys sanity, and walks all over what is to eventually become of the Man of Steel.  To be honest, I like animated heroes (the Batman and early X-Men on FOX has been particularly entertaining), but this goes a bit too far and ultimately corrupts anything of value within the written story.What made the story of Superman's death enjoyable was that there was just this unknown beast awakened, so to speak, and fate brought these two indestructible beings together.  It was the battle that drew us to the page, it was the punches that Superman threw and the unknown of this being later to be known as Doomsday, which kept us turning page after page.  (Editor's note: I realize that perhaps Doomsday had been seen in other story arcs, that perhaps there had been other back story eventually created, and that other events had been leading up to this, but when I was young I just read this one particular story - the Death of Superman, and it is the basis for this review.)  To fill nearly an hour and a half, perhaps the creators of this film decided they needed to bring Luther in to prove that they were making a Superman story, perhaps they needed to demonstrate a pathetic love story between Superman and Lane, perhaps they needed to show mass destruction in which people HAD TO HAVE died or been wounded, but it was done so poorly that it transformed a good idea direct-to-DVD to a DVD destined to be eventually found in the $1 bin.  They story should have revolved around the big meeting between Doomsday and Superman, but instead the culmination involved this sub-story with Lex Luthor.  I was hurt.  Everything from Olsen getting a job at a trashy magazine, to the cheap secondary villain, to renegade clones just hurt over time.  This was not the story of Superman fighting Doomsday, but instead several small stories using that brief moment to grow.  It was not the excitement that I anticipated, nor wanted.With the story in ruins, one would hope that the voice talent would at least bring a level of professionalism to the table, but again, I have been wrong many times before.  Adam Baldwin is a ""Firefly"" god, but he doesn't quite have the power for Superman's voice.  There wasn't the strength or humanity behind it, but simply your average man's voice behind the blue suit and cape.  Anne Heche, voicing Lois Lane, seemed (and sounded) like she had been smoking twelve packs a day.  It sounded like Anne Heche doing voice work on an animated film, not an actual character on screen.  The rest were equally as bad.  Case in point, if you need to use Kevin Smith's voice as a cameo in the film, than you need to realize that your film is failing.  He is not credited, but I do believe they used him twice for two insignificant characters, but it was obviously him.  There is one scene where Superman battles, well, with himself (when viewed you will understand), and the dialogue between the two are hysterical.  It is not supposed to be, but it had me nearly in tears.Story in shambles, voice work below average, what else could go wrong with this simple little direct-to-DVD release?  Two more issues arose upon viewing which will confuse the more novice film viewer.  Superman will not allow a child to be killed by Doomsday, but has no problem causing millions of dollars worth of structural damage to the city by merely hitting the beast?  Who eventually has to pay for the rebuilding?  Who made sure nobody was holding a meeting or having a small family reunion in one of those skyscrapers or obvious tenement buildings in Metropolis?  The big battle raged which was fun, but the consistency of this animated Superman was perplexing.  Why would he save one, yet endanger others?  Or, could it be possible that all of this section of Metropolis was empty at this time during the morning?  Too much chaos was happening to believe that nobody else was hurt during the rumble.  The second point, which is brief, but those understanding the comics will get it - why were there no questionable supermen born from this disaster.  Was anyone willing to follow the comic story at all - or was there more money in creating their own storyline?Overall, this was not the film I was expecting.  Again, having grown up reading that single volume of how the ""Man of Steel"" dies, I wanted to see perhaps a synopsis of his life, some of his adventures, all leading up (character development and story) to his big battle with Doomsday.  I realize that more happens afterwards, at least in the comic, but what was presented here, in this film, is not the world or story that I imaged.  In fact, all imagination was stripped away with the poorly voiced characters, the minimal ""darkness"" that needed to surround this iconic character, and the complete chaos caused with minimal consequences.  I must say that the one point I did like from this animated feature was the fact that people did die.  Not tons, but enough to surround the point.  The escape of Doomsday, the fight with Superman, and even Lex's creature all killed, and it was interesting to see that in this DVD.  In the end, it was a sorry, pathetic little film that is worthless compared to the comic it represents.  For those fans, or even us casual ones, this represented nothing but commercialism and capitalistic opportunity - two words that should not be associated with either film or the printed page.Grade: * out of *****",Superman: Doomsday
1084546,"I wish I had read some of the previous reviews before investing in this movie.  I won't give a synopsis of the plot, as a numer of the previous reviewers have already done that.  One would think that with the cast the producers had assembled, this film would be one of those movies which plays on the comic ironies of life.  It isn't.  The supporting characters are fairly one dimensional, only there to provide situations for Molly Shannon to play off of, so its hard to feel any real involvement or interest in them.  Perhaps thats why the cover of the DVD only shows Molly and her dog as an actual picture, while the rest of the cast are only line drawings.  The ending was peculiar, with Peggy (Molly Shannon)apparently deciding to devote her life to the welfare of animals rather than evolving into someone who could move comfortably in both worlds (people and animals).  You could term this a ""throw away movie"", as there is little about the film to encourage one to watch it again.  With Molly Shannon, I was expecting a funny script, but instead I sat through the film wondering where it was going.  Its a sad day when I felt more humanity in films like ""Never Been Kissed"" and ""Assault of the Killer Bimbos"" than I did in this one.  I mean, you really do care about Peaches Page, her flight from the law and the ultimate aprehension of Big Vinnie.",N/A

Now, of course, I see it for what it is: pure camp and great fun. Taken seriously one might think that it was one bad movie. It isn't. It is like an Andy Warhol painting. It captures a moment in time: 50's Sci-Fi as a spoof.I have actually waited along time for this widescreen DVD release, which btw is fantastic - no complaints at all. However, I think the greatest feature is the commentary of Laurie Mitchell who plays the Queen, a thankless job since she has to wear a mask and makeup during the whole picture. But what a sweet Lady! I can not think of a more appropriate person to do this.Another feature is that during the commentary some deleted scenes are enacted by Ms. Mitchell, and let me tell you, she is still great and can be terrifying in her role.

994568,"While most Argento fans will probably regret that he isn't doing nowadays what he did twenty years ago, they are completely missing the point with this, his first effort for the Master of Horror series. Argento is a director who actually keeps renewing and changing with the years instead of churning out the same stuff he has done over and over previously. And this time he really goes way over the top, even giving Lucio Fulci a run for his money. To those out there thinking that Eli Roth or Miike Takeshi are outrageous, you haven't seen anything yet.It's a pity that Americans get so easily shocked by some nudity and put down this film for the great amount of sex it includes (which by the way are essential to the story). Even sadder is that some scenes of oral sex were considered too much for American TV viewers and so were cut off (you can see them, though, on the documentary by Argento, included in the DVD).Contrary to some others fan's beliefs, Argento actually chose to adapt this story himself, having seen it in an old issue of Creepy (not Eerie). The original story is probably Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson's best effort ever.All in all this is the best film so far from the Masters of Horror series(at least from the first season), and Argento is still the MASTER. That's why I give it 5 stars.",Masters of Horror - Dario Argento - Jenifer
973688,"I'd never seen or heard of ""Decision before Dawn"" until it appeared in my recommended list on Amazon.com.  Released in 1951, it apparently has been on TV a number of times, but I never caught it.  Having it on DVD, especially at a bargain price, is welcome, indeed.There are no big stars in the movie, although Gary Merrill, Richard Basehart, and Oskar Werner are certainly well-known names.  The story is rather obscure in that it features Germans who change sides at the end of World War II, and end up spying on and fighting the Nazis.  Some of these spies are heroic, like Oskar Werner's character; others are simply mercenary.  In any event, we see that there were some good Germans who were loyal to their country, if not to the savage regime that took it over for 12 years.The movie is in black-and-white, which lends itself well to the feel of the subject.  It comes across almost as a docu-drama, to use modern terminology.  Many of the outdoor shots feel like how Germany must have been in the latter years of the war after allied bombing had reduced most cities to rubble.  You get a sense for the desperation and futility of ordinary people, as well, as the only ""love interest"" in the show, Hildegard Neff, vanishes almost as quickly as she appears.  And she never is seen again.If you're looking for a film that shows one of the pivotal points of the war, like ""The Battle of the Bulge,"" or ""The Battle of Britain,"" you might be disappointed in this show.  But if you want to see a realistic depiction of patriotic Germans who resisted the Nazis and helped end the war, you should be pleasantly surprised.  Acting is first-rate and the story is well-written and engaging.There is not really a happy ending in ""Decision before Dawn,"" unless you feel that the war is closer to its end as a result of what you've seen.  In that sense, the movie really seems much ahead of its time and should find a receptive audience.  As other reviewers point out, ""Decision before Dawn"" is really an anti-war film, showing as it does the futility of one group of humans intent on destroying another group.In summing up, I can't think of another movie to compare this one to.  I'd have to say the film is unique and worthy of its place in any World War II collection.",N/A

656674,"This is a creepy, scary movie.It wisely starts off by setting up the main character, and making it clear that he's pretty bored with going to so-called haunted hotel rooms and finding nothing.  Apparently writing about having seen no ghosts doesn't sell many books, either, which may explain why there are so many authors that apparently see them, and not many that don't.After the initial setup, which was very well paced, there is the (basically) one and only scene with Samuel L. Jackson, who must have been able to film all of his parts in a single day.  That's a shame, too, because he has a great deal of screen presence, and the parts he is in are very effective.Then begins the roller-coaster ride of scary things that go bump in the night.  This is done a *lot* better than I expected, and there is quite a bit of frenetic energy in this scare-a-thon.And then... the movie basically just ends.  It is almost like they weren't sure what to do, and just flipped the switch.  The final scene with his wife seemed tacked on.  I think it was intended to be some sort of revelation, but of what I'm not entirely sure. I guess that his next book is going to sell a lot better than the previous ones!",1408

967340,"Lady Vengeance (Chan-wook Park, 2005)In 2000, Chan-wook Park, a relatively obscure director, and Yeon-ae Lee, a young actress, teamed up for JSA: Joint Security Area, the movie that shot both of them to stardom in their native Korea. Park was to explode onto the international scene with Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the multiple-award-winning Oldboy; Lee continued being popular in Korea, but not so much outside it. All that changed when Park brought her back in to be the lead in Lady Vengeance, the final installment of his revenge trilogy. Poof--instant international stardom!As with the other revenge films, Lady Vengeance has as its main character a person who has been wrongly imprisoned. In this case, it's Geum-Ja (Lee), who went to prison for kidnap and murder for thirteen years. Now she's out, and she wants revenge. In order to get it, she enlists the help of a number of previously-released prison inmates who'd grown fond of her while they were incarcerated together, and the bunch put together an elaborate plan for the real killer's demise.It's a fun movie, as long as you're not turned off by a pervasive suggestion of violence (not a great deal of which is actually shown, in contrast to Oldboy). It's very straightforward, which lends the movie a somewhat deliberate pace; there aren't any red herrings being tossed around. We just have Geum-Ja's single-minded devotion to revenge, her plan, and its execution, on the plot side of things. This gives Park time to develop a number of the characters in interesting ways, especially Geum-Ja; interwoven with the flashback scenes of prison life are a number of earlier scenes that give us a sense of who she is as a person, and the extent to which prison changed her. Or did it? Were all her selfless acts in prison, where she was known as an angel, geared towards making allies to help her with her plan (which, at one point, she said began the day she went to prison)? We're never explicitly told, but in the end, it's a secondary consideration; the revenge is what matters. Lady Vengeance is simple and powerful, and worth your time. *** ",Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005)
1066322,"First off, the beauty of this film to me was that one could have a both fairly cerebral and emotional reaction to this movie rather easily. I mean that in the best of ways. ""The lives of others"" starts out with the decision of the state to monitor a playwrite, for reason's that are not exactly the purest. But soon stasi (secret police) member Gerd takes sympathy with those he is forced to watch, and according to some, seems to fall in love with their lives. The plot thickens as a article written by a secret east german writer appears in the west, who the goverment believe to the character of Georg who is already under watch. Thought the rest of the movie, Gerd takes action to make sure that Georg is protected from the over zealous hammer of authority. One can only wish we met such people more often. Without giving away the rest of the plot, a great deal of drama, wonderful acting, and a amazing background setting(I must find out where this is filmed!). One of the wonderful things I took away from this movie, was seeing the person make the choice of using his ethics and heart, rather than excusing himself with the old failed defense of ""taking orders"".

When you're 12 years old looking for adventure involving dinosaurs, this filled the bill, even though you knew that they weren't like the dinosaurs in your playset, books or King Kong.  It was big and colorful.  That probably won't be good enough for today's kids; the big won't be there on the small screen and color is taken for granted.  And no CGI.

Well, I can read between the lines here and assumed that the lawsuit put the kibosh on any plans Buena Vista had to release the Marvel '66 collection. Weather it was sour grapes or just a bad business vibe where Buena Vista felt that Marvel wouldn't allow any latitude to try to recoup if sales were soft, that seems to me to be the end of that dream. I sincerely doubt that anyone else will try to release this cartoon series (why is this again that Marvel can't just do this themselves?) Anyway, Major bummer!!!!!!!!

672152,"This performance sparkles. Musically, it is fabulous--I have the CD version as well and this is what prompted me to get the DVD. None of Mozart's poignancy and empathy is lost, and all of his vivacity is brought out. Others have emphasized the fun as in `funny' or `comedic', and it is certainly there. I add that there is also a great deal of fun as in `pleasurable'. There is a flirtatious zing to the whole performance, perhaps more so than to many other Figaros.The staging is all fine and good until Act III, when it becomes nothing less than stunning. That Act alone makes the DVD well worth getting! It accentuates the subversive bite of the opera brilliantly. Figaro is a piece of social satire, every bit as relevant today as it was over two hundred years ago. It is among other things a story of love and sensuality set against ossified social structures. When the stage changes before the Count's big aria(`Vedro mentr'io sospiro') and the magnificent buffoon--all decked out in the regalia of power--rages in his gilded cage, it is truly jaw-dropping. The contrast is made all the more delicious by having an actor as magnificent-looking as Gilfry play the Count! The various subversive jibes at the Count are delivered with obvious glee and the commonfolk keep grinning throughout the action. I too found myself giddy with delight watching the Count fold under the collective pressure of his servants. The dominant classes of the 18th century must have been dumbfounded, sensing the loss of their authority and not comprehending how it happens; having to furthermore sit there in total rapture and feel the rug being gently pulled out from underneath them. Doing justice to Mozart's satirical subtext never ever overshadows the warmth and beauty of the music. In `Dove Sono', the Countess' glittering costume, impeccable wig, and doll-like make-up bring out her desolation and vulnerability even more. It is a deeply moving sight.To those who want to see a gorgeously staged and performed Figaro, this DVD offers plenty. And then some. I did not find the sets minimalist; I found them just right, neither stuffily traditional nor wackily modernist.And now, where is the Z&uuml;rich/Harnoncourt production from 1996 in region-free format?

1019002,"""Ergo Proxy"" is one of the most beautiful anime ever made. It's also very complex, filled with allusions mysterious and even more mysterious, obscure, opaque, a story about the search for self and meaning in a bleak post-apocalyptic world of domed cities, androids (""autoraves""), warfare, and death. The heroine, Real Mayar (also Re-l Mayer), is stunningly beautiful as she undertakes to unravel the mysteries of a killer freak as she befriends an oddly lonely immigrant named Vincent Law.But, a warning: if you want cartoons that spell out all the details a la ""Hamtaro"" or ""Cinderella"", you will be bored witless and irritated by ""Ergo Proxy."" The premise is that the *viewer* also participates in Ergo Proxy's search for self and meaning. It is distinctly intellectual, in the sense of thoughtful: the viewer is *expected* to ponder over meaning, especially the meanings of identity and memory. Entire scenes exist solely to create analogies between what Real and Vincent do and the viewer's consensus (although false) beliefs about reality. ""Ergo Proxy"" operates in the interstices of such realities, in sepia, gray, and icy blue images of radical incompleteness.Visually, Ergo Proxy has only rarely been equaled in animation. It has a hard-to-describe kind of lyrical bleakness offset by Real's beauty - which is just one of the contradictions that suffuse the story. If you want everything telegraphed by the middle of episode 1, watch something else. But for a depiction of what used to be called ""existential"" search, ""Ergo Proxy"" is superb - vivid, gorgeous, lots of action scenes, all in a world that we recognize as our own.",N/A

Strangely, he is simultaneously fighting to find who he is and running from the secrets he unburies. These movies put you in the grit and chaos of a post-Cold War spy game that plays out in some of the most thrilling locales in the world. The characters are relentless and, unlike other spy movies, the imperative behind their actions will strike a nerve with even the most callous movie-goer. The movies are not about grand schemes to overthrow the existing regime. Rather, they are about survival, finding out who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, and if there really is a difference.

Maybe it's the way his alter ego, Clark Kent, seems like a geeky outsider which finds a lot in common with the general public.Perhaps it's the kid in all of us which wishes they had the ability to fly, or super human strength, or x-ray vision.Whatever the case, you're fall into one of two categories.  Either you're an obsessive fan who works Superman into each and every one of your works (like comedian Jerry Seinfeld) or you're the casual fan who really enjoys the movies, but doesn't have a shrine dedicated to the hero from planet Krypton (like me.)From the legends humble beginnings spawned from the imagination of two young guys from Cleveland, Ohio to the pop cultrual phenomenon known worldwide and every place between.  This fascinating history of the famed DC comics figure is a visual stunner.Throughout the years Superman has been a comic book, a cartoon, a movie franchise, a tv show, even a failed broadway musical.  He's been taken seriously and ridiculed.  He's been praised and balked at.However, the constant remains, as the viewer witnesses; Superman is what all humans should be.  He has morals, and he stands up for all that is right in the world.I recommend this DVD simply because, like I said, it's fascinating.  It's amazing how many actors once portrayed Superman or Lois Lane.  Along with the changes and tranformations the comic book and many characters have endured.

440039,"I've been watching Patton about every other year since I was a child and have to say that the movie never gets old. As far as performances go, George C. Scott exceeds all expectations in this role. You get the feeling while watching him that the actor indeed thought he was his character during his time on the set. His Patton is the epitome of passion, desire, will, and honor. Of course, true to life, he was a complicated figure and the film displays this aspect of the man as well. He was vainglorious and rash--attributes often expected, and forgivable in a general. Scott's impressive but so is the script. One of the nice things about this DVD is that Francis Ford Coppola gives a short intro in which he shares that he was the screenplay writer and also fleshes out a few circumstances around the making of The Godfather. His perspective adds to one's appreciation of the film. Patton also has some great action scenes such as the initial battle in the desert against, who he thought was, Rommel. The German General Staff scenes are speculative but unquestionably entertaining. I find Patton to be a fun and noble flick.",N/A

1020186,"The Golden Globes are over and their new Animation Category has been added (2007). And anyone who thought MONSTER HOUSE had even a remote shot at winning this award must've been smoking crack. Up against HAPPY FEET and the awesomely entertaining CARS, Monster House was the lemon in the animation ranks. Even though the animation was good (actually these things are more a cartoonish CGI than animation), the story missed by a mile.More interesting than the story itself was the manner in which it was made. On the extra features of the DVD it shows how small, electronic balls were attached to actors as they read their lines and acted out the parts, allowing the CGI animators the ability to track every facial twitch and finger movement, thus making the animated characters move in a more life-like fashion.I don't usually mention the MPAA ratings of films, but here I'm going to make an exception because this supposedly kid-friendly film is rated PG, not G. My guess is that the violence and the one off-comment about female anatomy (""Oh. So it's a girl house."") forced this rating on the film (just something for those stickler parents to be aware of, although I'd be willing to bet your little kiddies get more information from the Victoria Secrets catalogue in your monthly mail and more bloody viewing on the nightly news).The story is about a dank house on a quiet street. This house is inhabited by a crazy old coot named Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) who guards his property with rabid ferocity. Any toys that end up on his lawn are immediately confiscated and never seen again. Across the street from Mr. Nebbercracker lives D.J. (Mitchel Musso). He's infatuated with the dark and dreary house, and spies on it via a telescope from his upstairs bedroom window. And when D.J.'s parents head out for the weekend and put a babysitter in charge of D.J., things start to get interesting. The babysitter's boyfriend vanishes, and D.J. instigates an argument with old man Nebbercracker, only to have the crotchety man fall over with an apparent heart attack. An ambulance takes Nebbercracker away and the house now sits vacant on the verge of Halloween eve.D.J.'s best friend, Chowder, comes over, too, and when D.J. tells Chowder about the strange goings on at the vacant house, Chowder doesn't believe him and decides to play doorbell ditch. But when he rings the bell, the house comes alive! The spirit of ...something lives in its walls.As the boys try and figure out what's going on, they also encounter an entrepreneurial young cookie sales-girl named Jenny whom both boys become somewhat enraptured with; Chowder and D.J. are, after all (so we're told), approaching puberty.Initially the boys and Jenny think that old man Nebbercracker is dead, but his unexpected return changes everything they once thought they knew about the old, scarey house.Although loaded with plenty of action, scarey scenes, and funny buddy dialogue, the story is simply not up to par. The fact that D.J. is approaching puberty has nothing to do with the story's end result and is given way too much emphasis throughout. The babysitter (Maggie Gyllenhaal) also has little to do with the story and appears more as filler than anything else.Even so, the animation is interesting and the action will keep most viewers watching. Just don't expect Happy Feet or Cars and you'll probably do just fine with Monster House.",N/A

You can't take ""Queen Bee"" too seriously or you'll be horrified by Joan's horrible behavior.

379158,"What else can I say about this movie? This... um... sequel (?) to a previous alien encounter film called Xtro is not only a blatant rip off of other, more popular Sci-Fi movies but it does them in the worst way possible. The script is a nightmare, the special effects are weak, the acting is weaker, and the whole idea just shouldn't have been done to begin with. Xtro II: The Second Encounter has nothing new (or even decent) to offer to science fiction or horror fans.Have you seen the original Xtro? Don't worry if you haven't because this ""sequel"" has absolutely nothing to do with it. Not a single connection is made between the two movies other than an alien killer is on the loose. I guess director Harry Davenport just likes to name his alien invader movies Xtro no matter how unrelated they are. The worse thing about this is the movie makes references to significant stuff that happened in the past. To a casual viewer they might think it's the previous movie when in fact it's stuff that's not from any previous movie. The references are so ominous and evasive that you can't help but wonder what the heck they are talking about.This is the sort of thing that plagues the script from beginning to end. The plot is vague and incoherent along with the fact some really dumb (and thankfully minor) plot twists are also splattered along the story. Essentially the movie moves from an Alien knock off plot with characters getting picked off one by one (and you can see it's coming a mile away) to an Aliens (the movie) knock off with more people getting picked off (again making you feel psychic for knowing who gets it and when). Any attempt to build suspense or fear fails miserably. The dialog is utter tripe, with lame one-liners and wannabe catch phrases all over the place. The more embarrassing being when they start doing ""tech talk"", which reminded me of Spaced Invaders. Only with Spaced Invaders they meant to make it sound silly.Character development? You can forget that. The characters are written one-dimensional and the acting doesn't get much better. The only character with even a hint of decent dialog is Zunoski, but it's not enough to endorse this film.  All of the acting is pretty lame with just a little exception to Jano Frandsen, who in the final 20 minutes of the movie finally shows some character development. Actually there is probably ten minutes in this movie where I did start feeling interested in it and it's during this Frandsen moment. But again it's not enough to give this movie any kudos. Special effects aren't special at all. As a matter of fact it feels more like an 80's movie. That's probably due to a small budget. I will give props on the design of the alien monster, even if how it came to be, why it's killing everyone, and how the characters handle it give more than enough to ruin what little the movie has going for it.Xtro II is a mistake. My only guess on why they made it was because they thought they could make money with just clich&eacute;s and no well-developed story. I can only recommend this to Mystery Science Theater 3000 as they are the only ones who could make something of this picture. I don't recommend this anybody or anything else. If you seen the first two Alien movies you have already seen tons more than what this film can possibly offer.",Xtro 2:the Second Encounter VHS
374349,"The whole concept behind this PPV is that every match had a gimmick to it...good & unique concept that honestly was executed poorly.  Also none of the titles were on the line thoughout this PPV which made some of the matches seem like ""what was the point of that?""  This PPV turned out to be a complete embarrisment to WCW (and wrestling) at the time.King Of The Road Match: Dustin Rhodes vs. Blacktop Bully - This match took place on the back of a caged flatbed moving truck where you had to move from the back to front & ring a bell at the top of the flatbed.  They were limited in what they could do so it wasn't anything special once you get past the whole ""they're fighting on the back of a flatbed truck"" thing.Martial Arts Match: Jim Duggan vs. Meng - Duggan doesn't know anything about martial arts so this was really a brawler vs. martal arts match...and it just wasn't any good period.Boxer vs. Wrestler Match: Johnny B. Badd vs. Arn Anderson - You can see why these type of matches never work because it just wasn't a good mesh.  It had a comical ending around the third round but besides that, it was like a train wreck that you had to just watch.Randy Savage vs. Avalanche - This match was just too slow & dull and Macho Man was grounded with slow moves by Avalanche.  The only thing to note in this match was Ric Flair dressing up in drag (complete with makeup, painted fingernails, ect.) to attack Randy Savage.  It's sad what Flair was reduced to at this time.Sting vs. Big Bubba - This was just another dull & boring match but I'll give some credit as Sting sold his hurt leg better than I've seen most wrestlers sell injuries.Falls Count Anywhere Match: Nasty Boys vs. Harlem Heat - This was the match of the night as this was the all over the arena brawl that resulted in everything being used as weapons...including mustard & funnel cakes with Sherri tripping & falling over all the mess that was made during this match.  It was just a fun wild & crazy brawl to watch.Strap Match: Hulk Hogan vs. Vader - Due to the backstage politics surrounding this entire fued (both men refused to job cleanly to each other), this match was overbooked with various runins & angles that was completely overkill.  First, this match was the debut of the Renegade character...which was nothing more than a cheap knockoff of the Ultimate Warrior (which Eric Bischoff, V.P. of WCW, admitted in Warrior's WWE DVD).  Another story was the ""kidnapping of Jimmy Hart"" in which he came out during the match with the assumption that Flair & Vader kidnapped Hart to keep him from being in Hogan's corner.  The masked man angle that WCW did back in late '97 (who was unmasked to be Brutus Beekcake back in October) returned here as well for it be revealed that Arn Anderson was in on everything going on with Flair & Vader as well.  Due to each man not willing to do the job, the ending had Hogan tied Flair to the strap (who was still wearing the makeup on his face from the Savage attack earlier) and touched all the corners with Flair attached to win the match.  Again, this was just out of control wacky booking that killed this match.In the end, WCW Uncensored was just a complete joke of an event that isn't even worth watching unless you just like to get a guilty pleasure out of ""wrestlecrap"" moments like this PPV.

Later in life, I wished this book could be made into a movie, and my dream really came true when I purchased  the DVD. This movie is based entirely on the book by English railway bridge  builder, John Patterson.Ironically, the pair of male lions as depicted in the movie was borrowed  from a zoo farm in Alberta, Canada. These lions were fully mane. But in the book, John Patterson described those two lions as lean and maneless...! As factually,  most  lions in Tsavo of Kenya don't have the beautiful mane unlike their cousins in other parts of Africa. This is unusual, maneless male lions because only females don't spot a mane. The movie will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end - never a dull moment. I consider this as the best thrilling movie ever made in the wilds of Africa, especially at this time when the public is conscious about nature conservation. Too bad that  when the movie was made in early 1900s, surround sound was not a popular feature and therefore not included, otherwise the roars of these two persistent man-eaters in the dead of the African night would be very nighmarish in our den when we watch the movie...! Yes, these two lions did chomp more than a hundred railway workers that at one stage they were compelled to quit until the pair was finally hunted down. John finally skinned the two man-eating lions and sold their skins  and bones to the field museum at  Springfield, Illioness. This pair of  mounted, maneless  notorious man-eating lions are still there for everyone to see and contemplate.This classic movie depicting  a strange aspect of yesterday-Africa is historically true and thus highly recommended.

1071905,"Nicholas Ray's directoral debut,  ""THE LIVE BY NIGHT"" (1948) is a poignant, noirish love story not unlike the much later  ""BONNIE AND CLYDE.""But the real gem in this double-feature DVD is Anthony Mann's ""SIDE STREET"" (1949), a gritty, compelling, crime drama that is a true film noir.It follows the downward spiral of sympathetic, naive and desperate Farley Granger -- a letter carrier with a pregnant wife -- after he steals some money from a pair of very bad guys.  Granger stashes the money with a ""friend"" and then decides to give it back -- but the friend has hit the road with the loot.  The bad guys Granger stole from aren't amused.  They are unrelenting in their pursuit of Granger.The movie goes all the way with the premis. There's a terrific, extended, car chase that is strikingly photographed, perhaps a first of it's kind in a drama and clearly a model for the one in ""BULLET.""This is a satisfying, taught film with beautifully composed, stark, BW location cinematography in lower Manhattan that perfectly matches the story.  Location as metaphor!  Highly recommended.",Film Noir Double Feature: (They Live by Night / Side Street)
1084097,"I really love ""The Cosby Show."" Like millions of other families, every Thursday night when this came on, my family and I would get around the TV and watch it.Why is ""The Cosby Show"" so groundbreaking?It is really the first accurate depiction of an African-American family. Prior to ""The Cosby Show,"" African-American sitcoms always had the buffoon character with unrealistic storylines. But ""The Cosby Show"" refused to pander to the lowest common denominator. And by doing so they became the Number One Sitcom in the country. ""The Cosby Show"" said that the black family was no different from the white family or the Asian-American family or the Latin-American family. Maybe the main message of ""The Cosby Show"" was that in the end we all have the same problems and the same goals.It's really hard to say who my favorite character is on ""The Cosby Show."" The entire cast is so likeable. Watching them was like watching old friends. If I had to pick, of course first would be Dr. Huxtable (played by the Cos, of course.) Because even when the kids did something wrong he was fair but very funny. And, coming in at a close second is Denise (Lilakoi Moon, more commonly known as Lisa Bonet.) Denise was always such a free spirit. And, of course I adored Mrs. Huxtable (Phylicia Rashd.) Didn't everyone wish they had a mom like her?",The Best of the Cosby Show
881934,"This 2005 creature feature aired on the Sci Fi Channel. Yeah. I could stop reviewing right there because that's all you really need to know about this formulaic monster flick. Why go on? Nature run amok movie...Sci Fi Channel...clich&eacute;d. Nearly every film that ever aired on the Sci Fi Channel stinks in some significant way. Bad acting from second and third tier actors and actresses, lazy direction, cheap set pieces, bad CGI special effects, lame plots--it's always the same story with these guys. I'm not sure whom they've got in their stable of writers over there, but they need new blood fast. I suspect the same script just floats around in perpetuity with only the names of the characters and the type of beast changing on a regular basis. The plot always goes something like this: outsider or scientist type moves into small community, discovers a sinister corporate/military/evil white guy conspiracy that sacrifices nature in the quest for profits, and joins a small group of those in the know in order to destroy the threatening monstrosities in question. The end. Add a few twists to the plot, sprinkle in a ton of clich&eacute;s, and you've got yourself the latest Sci Fi Channel movie of the week.""Larva"" meets all of the above requirements, and then some. The story's hero is Dr. Eli Rudkus (Vincent Ventresca), a new veterinarian moving to the little town of Host, Missouri in order to fill the vacancy left by his predecessor. The town desperately needs Emil's services since the main means of income in the little berg revolves around the cattle industry. In fact, a corporate concern (here we go) called Host Tender Meats pretty much controls the village. They buy up all the product in town and call the shots about what the cattle eat. That's why the company is especially stoked about a new feed they've developed. According to the company's PR flacks, the new food will guarantee adding serious weight to the cattle in town. More weight equals...wait for it...more beef and more profits. Everyone wins. WRONG! Host Tender Meats has a serious problem with their new product, a problem we witness in the opening scenes of the film when a weird creature bursts out of a dead cow in full view of several teenage witnesses. No one knows at the time what just happened, but they will soon. Host, Missouri is about to become a disaster area.Rudkus learns about this strange phenomenon when a local rancher by the name of Jacob Lang (William Forsythe) calls him in to perform tests on this odd creature. The veterinarian discovers a couple of disturbing things. He learns that the larva likes human blood and grows larger after a feeding, and he suspects the new feed from Host Tender Meats is causing this aberration of nature. When he tries to tell the townspeople, they greet his claims with jeers. So do the higher ups at Host Tender Meats. The evil owner of the firm, Fletcher Odermatt (David Selby), and his attack dog lawyer Hayley Anderson (Rachel Hunter) laugh loudly and publicly at Rudkus's concerns. Eli's charges soon bear fruit when the larvae begin attacking human targets. Fortunately for the film, this involves an ""Alien"" like embryonic period followed by a cheesy CGI beastie bursting out of the victim's chest. Eli, Jacob Lang, and the newly educated Hayley Anderson join forces to save the town. Their mission is not easy. You see, the larvae soon develop the ability to fly through the air. Yes sir, flying larvae. No one is safe, and the very fate of the world rests in the hands of these unlikely heroes. Roll credits.I detected several subtleties in the script that surprised me considering the low budget, clich&eacute;d mess that is ""Larva"". Check out Eli's last name. Rudkus is the surname of the main character in Upton Sinclair's seminal socialist, anti-meatpacking industry screed ""The Jungle"". In fact, a lot of the plot mirrors stuff that took place in Sinclair's novel. The monopoly Host Tender Meats uses to control the ranchers, for example, as well as having the town sheriff on the company payroll is lifted right out of the book. Pretty obvious where the screenwriters' sympathies lie, eh? The literary underpinnings of the movie fail to help in other areas, however. The cheap 'n cheesy CGI effects are laughable, as is the idea of Rachel Hunter playing a corporate lawyer. Also working against the film (or for it depending on your demeanor) is a number of unintentionally hilarious scenes. I couldn't stop laughing over the sequence involving two youngsters messing around with each other only to have their little skin party interrupted by the messy arrival of a larva bustin' out of the boyfriend's body. The following chase scene involving the girlfriend and the beastie keeps the guffaws coming. Heck, even the goofy picture on the DVD cover made me giggle.First Look Pictures (a warning sign about the quality of the picture right there) brings ""Larva"" to DVD with no extras. Oh well. The film is still more than watchable. Sure, it's stupid on a metaphysical level with truly humongous plot holes, but the humorous aspects in a number of scenes coupled with decent acting (thank the lord for small favors) and several extremely gory kills make this movie a must see for creature feature fans. As I indicated above, it's not original in any way, shape, or form. Clich&eacute;s abound. But every once in awhile we need to sit down with a movie, throttle our brains down into neutral, and just veg out in front of something truly mindless. ""Larva"" fits that bill quite nicely. I think I'll give the film three stars. That's probably one more than it deserves, but I'm feeling generous tonight. Have fun and don't consume any meat lest you become the next victim of LARVA! Bwaahahahahahaha!",N/A
1105549,"I agree with reviewer Lewis Jackman, who says this movie was way overrated just because Adrienne Shelly died before it was released.  I could tell within about ten minutes of listening to the inane dialogue that this was going to be disappointing.  Keri is soooo beautiful, but neither she nor any of the other characters was believable, except maybe Andy Griffith.  (Like, why would beautiful Keri Russell even consider marrying an abusive meathead like Jeremy Sisto's ""Earl""?)  Even the passionate love scenes were so exaggerated as to be ridiculous.  The film was very anti-men, too -- other than Griffith's character, the men were all either weak, nerdy or abusive.  Jeremy Sisto, who was so great in ""Six Feet Under,"" is utterly wasted here.",N/A
1051762,"It is a true disgrace that shows get butchered because of rights.  This has happened before.

I'm surprised certain clothing lines haven't demanded money for the rights to Beverly Hills 90210.  (Quick, airbrush their clothes!!!!)Here's an idea for Fox.  Instead of charging the $39.98 market price for the DVD set, charge $54.98.  That would add $15 per sale extra into the budget.  If you sell a meer 100,000 copies of the DVD (which I believe the city of Cincinnati, itself, would purchase) you then have $1.5 million to put towards the rights of the original songs.

90626,"25 years after the theatrical release of Ridley Scott's science fiction masterpiece Blade Runner, the film still retains every bit of its visual brilliance (made even more gorgeous with digitally remastered picture), but it's crystal clear that more than just the imagery makes Scott's 3rd film one of the most important and entertaining films of its genre.In futuristic Los Angeles, androids designed to be nearly indistinguishable from humans are banned from Earth after mutinous actions off-world. These Replicants that attempt to return are to be hunted down and ""retired"" by special police units known as Blade Runners. When one such enforcer, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is assigned to eliminate a group of extremely dangerous Nexus 6 Series Replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), he begins to acknowledge the thin line that defines humanity. In his eventual confrontation with Batty, and through encounters with an unknowing Replicant named Rachel (Sean Young), Deckard will learn what it means to be human.The steady build of each main character is truly flawless and the deliberate pacing allows for more powerful revelations into the intricacies of humanity. Harrison Ford perfectly captures the initially remorseless Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who terminates Replicants for a living and appears indifferent towards their existence - that is until he encounters Rachel. Slowly falling for the beautiful creation, who doesn't even realize what she is, Deckard begins to question what it means to be human (and many believe Deckard to be a Replicant himself, generating even more philosophical questions).Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty embodies the perfect antagonist to Deckard's antihero, a violent and ruthless killer who wants what he cannot have - an extension on life itself. A sporting terminator of sorts, Batty possesses many attributes that Deckard does not (and vice versa), and the two parallel and supplement the essence of each other's existence. Batty starts with a clear purpose and mission, yet ends meeting the inevitable fate so cruelly inherent to his kind. Deckard has a less focused existence and is forced into his unwanted assignment; he only begins to value life when he falls in love with Rachel and acquires a new purpose. He gains life and love as Batty loses both. Batty's poetic final words echo a loss of life, not the simple ""retiring"" of an android, and Gaff's portent closing admonition accords with Deckard's desire to cherish what time he has left with Rachel.The set designs and look of the film is nothing short of cinematically inspired. Turbid steam flows freely from every mechanical object hovering, gliding and scampering about; murky water plummets from the sky, drips from ceilings and skates across the trash-ridden streets of a futuristic Los Angeles. Styled to look like Tokyo if it had succumb to gross overpopulation, pollution and a totalitarian government, the streets of 2019 L.A. are covered in highly stylized denizens not that far removed from the cantina of Mos Eisley. A feeling of dread, alienation and claustrophobia lingers about every blackened, sordid street, and the various smattering of languages creates a further isolation from the comforts of familiar humanity.Enormous, uninviting skyscrapers tower above the dusky horizon, and blinking spaceships scurry around the bustling airways. Every bit of scenery is blanketed with smog, shadows and smoke, and shimmering neons and electric billboards peek through the dismal vapors. The atmosphere of Blade Runner is wholly unique, and it adds to the striking seriousness of every event, no matter how outlandish or (science) fictional, and gives it the distinct tone of uncertainty, dehumanization and fear surrounding mortality. Pulsing electronic rhythms by Vangelis permeate the grim events and narrate the moody film noir elements that frequent this seminal science fiction epic.Some say 2001: A Space Odyssey is the finest example of science fiction ever to grace the big screen, but we say Blade Runner. With suspenseful action, perfect acting, unbeatable character development and designs, beautifully foreboding sets, poetic dialogue, poignant themes, gripping violence, flawless storytelling and a love story to boot, Ridley Scott's broodingly dark foray into serious science fiction is the uncontested champion.- The Massie Twins",Blade Runner

952853,"One of the adverts at the start of the version of this DVD which I watched was placed by a campaign against the arms trade. The advert took the form of a spoof TV advert for weapons. It's difficult to see what the people who paid for this advert thought they were adding to what is already on the disc; essentially the film itself is a much longer and more sophisticated version of the same point.Nicolas Cage plays the central character and narrator Yuri Orlov, who was born in what is now the Ukraine and emigrated from the former Soviet Union with his parents. He becomes an international arms dealer. Obviously damaged inside by the human consequences of his trade, Orlov tries to deal with them by distancing himself from the actions of his customers and avoiding crimes other than gun-running. When a Columbian drug baron wants to pay him in cocaine rather than money, Orlov protests ""I'm am arms trader, not a drug dealer."" At one point one of his customers tries to ""reward"" Orlov by providing on a plate the opportunity to take revenge on a rival arms dealer who had murdered Yuri Orlov's uncle. Although he had been close to his uncle and upset by that murder Orlov does not want to pull the trigger himself to kill the man responsible even under duress.Cage is one of very few actors who could bring off the studied understatement and ironic black humour required of the central character and narrator to make this film work. You are never quite sure what exactly is going on inside Orlov's head. When he sees Gorbachov on TV announcing the end of the cold war, Yuri is so delighted that he barely hears his wife Eva (Bridget Moynahan) saying that their baby son is walking for the first time; but you are unclear whether he is so pleased because he cares about the country of his birth or because this will mean more opportunties for gun running.Most viewers will be clear that for all Orlov's wealth they would not want to change places with him: at one point Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who is the nearest thing the film has to a hero says to him ""I'd tell you to go to Hell - but I think you're already there.""Strong performance from a  number of other cast members. Jared Leto is Yuri's brother and sidekick Vitaly Orlov who has even more trouble dealing with guilt about what they do; Bridget Moynahan gives a sterling performance as the trophy wife who is deeply disturbed to learn where the wealth which supports her comfortable life comes from.Eamonn Walker gives a chilling performance as Orlov's most lucrative and dangerous customer, President Andre Baptiste of Liberia. This character appears to be based on former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who is currently awaiting trial on War Crimes charges before the Hague tribunal.Ethan Hawke plays an idealistic Interpol agent who will do almost anything, except break the law himself, to stop gun-runners like Orlov.If you have seen the trailer for this, be warned that, like that for Cage's recent film ""The Weather Guy"" it shows quite a bit of black humour in the film which is laugh out loud funny out of context (e.g. in the trailer) but is not so amusing in context.As an edgy thriller or a story of moral destruction this film works. AS a political polemic, a number of the points it makes are direct hits but it is easy to pick holes in and rather one-sided, especially at the end where the film suggests all government supplies of arms are morally equivalent to traders like Orlov.Some government supplies of arms may be on that level, but without an arms industry and supply of weapons we would have had nothing with which to fight evils such as the Nazis. With no arms industry, those of us who have no Jewish blood would have to ask ""How High?"" whenever a fascist Gauleiter said ""Jump!"" and those who do have Jewish ancestry would not be alive.For fans of Nicolas Cage this is possibly the best performance of his career. Worth watching if you want to see a dramatic portrait of material success and moral decline. Not a good film to watch if you want a piece of light entertainment or cheering up.",N/A

The editing seems a bit sloppy with continuity of the time line and with reactions to special effects (reactions by Chevy Chase are slow like in a bad low-budget flick).  There is humor and a touch of romance but it just doesn't fit smoothly.  The wide range of ages was intended to appeal to a larger audience but it was mostly about Zoom and not the kids when it came to actual camera time.  Still, it is enjoyable and rather fun.

291587,"I'm not a big fan of Peckinpah, but this is by far his best film in my view.  I read a review of this film somewhere else (IMBD maybe?) that stated that this was the last of the B grade Westerns.  If so, this is certainly one of the best.  It's ironic that one of the last films of this genre actually defines it.  There is so much to love about this film.  First, and most importantly, the story line is surprisingly complex for a film of this genre. This is no simple good guys versus bad guys type Western, the roles are more morally ambiguous and subtle.  Second, this was the last performance for one of the actors (Scott) and the last decent performance by the other (McCrea) who largely defined the genre.  Scott of course is an icon of the B Western, and McCrea had a solid career as well making this type of film.  The plot is relatively straight forward.  Two old friends decide to work together one last time.  Their job is to ride up to a mining town, collect gold from the miners, and return it safely to the bank.  One of the two decides it might be more profitable to take off with the gold themselves.  Along the way they pickup a young Mariette Hartley who wants to escape from her overprotective Bible-quoting father.  Things get interesting when Hartley marries a brute in the mining town and the groom and his family decide that she can't change her mind.  Definitely recommended.",Ride the High Country VHS
426500,"The Jungle Book is a significant film for several reasons. First, it was the last film that Walt Disney himself was involved in directly. Walt had not been happy with some of the company's recent efforts such as ""Sword in the Stone"" and he took a more hands-on role with Jungle Book. Unfortunately, Disney would not see the fruits of his efforts. He passed away in December 1966, about seven months before the film was released. Still, Disney's handprints are all over the film. Initially conceived as a darker, more dramatic film, and more influenced by Rudyard Kipling's original story, Disney tossed out the idea, along with the original director. The result was the last great Disney animated film before the company was rejuvenated in the 1990's with films like ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". By anyone's account, their films of the 70's and 80's were lacking the passion of earlier efforts.Yet another significant difference in this movie was the use of major Hollywood talent to supply the voices for most of the characters. This is common practice today but was not the norm in the 1960's. And you probably could not have selected a more eclectic group of actors. At one of the spectrum you have stately British actors Sebastion Cabot as Bagheera the Panther and George Sanders (one of Hollywood's great voices) as the sinister tiger Shere Khan. At the polar opposite was Comedian/actor /bandleader Phil Harris and his southern drawl playing happy-go-lucky bear Baloo, along with Jazz bandleader and swing singer Louis Prima as the voice of orangutan King Louis. Additional voices were provided by Sterling Holloway as Kaa the snake. Holloway is better known for providing the voice of another Disney character, Winnie the Pooh. Ron Howard's brother, Clint, voiced baby elephant Junior. One other footnote, the singing voice of Shere Khan was performed by Thurl Ravenscroft who was the voice of Tony the Tiger, as well as the singer of the ""Grinch"" song.The story oh Jungle Book is simple. Little boy Mowgli was found in the jungle and raised by wolves. But when the wolves find out that the evil Shere Khan is returning to the jungle, they enlist the aid of Bagheera and Baloo to escort Mowgli back to the man village. The only problem is that Mowgli doesn't want to go. He's grown up in the jungle and the animals are his friends and only family. Complicating masters is not one, but three villains. Besides Shere Khan, Kaa and King Louie all want Mowgli for their own reasons. Bagheera and Baloo have to keep him safe from the villains and convince him that the man village is the best place for him.Jungle book contains two of the best songs in Disney history, ""The Bare Necessities"" and the swinging `I Wanna be Like You"". These are timeless songs which were both Oscar-nominated. Not to be forgotten is the menacing and hypnotic ""Trust in Me"" sung by Kaa to Mowgli as he prepares to make a meal of him. It's a fantastic production and the animation is simply gorgeous. Watch the scene when Mowgli is walking by himself through the jungle, kicking at the ground. The fluidity of movement is perfect, and watch how his hair blows in the gentle breeze. 3D animation may be the rage today but there's nothing like outstanding 2D animation.This is the latest Disney classic to get the platinum treatment and while it doesn't have as many special features as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it's still a solid lineup of extras. The making of documentary runs about 45 minutes and includes current and vintage interviews with many of the writers, animators, actors, and the composers who were involved in the project. This takes you through the complete process and there's great footage of Prima and his band dancing about as they perform ""I Wanna Be Like you"". In ""Mowgli's Return to the Jungle"", Bruce Reitherman, the voice of Mowgli, shares his memories of making the film and how the experiences influenced his current job as a wildlife filmmaker. Reitherman's father, Wolfgang, was the film's director.There's an interesting short featurette on a lost character from the film. The near-sighted, short-tempered rhinoceros named Rocky is brought to the screen using original storyboards and original voice recordings by Frank Fontaine. In addition there's a couple of other featurettes, audio commentary, sill gallery, music videos, and games. The word classic is over used today but it definitely applies to The Jungle Book. Forty years later this is still a wonderful film for the whole family.REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",The Jungle Book Fully Restored 30th Anniversary VHS

Too, casting Malcolm McDowell (light colored hair/blue-eyes, 5' 8"" tall, and weighing 140lbs dripping wet) as the bluff rogue Flashman (black hair and black moustache/dark brown-eyes, 6' tall, and weighing in at 13 stone = 180lbs) was totally wrong. GMF said he thought Flashy should be played by someone like the late Errol Flynn ""...with his impudent swagger, athletic grace, and matchless style."" (Fraser's THE HOLLYWOOD HISTORY OF THE WORLD p.54)  Perhaps Liam Neeson.I was surprised that this was more of a Benny Hill type of slapstick and sightgag film, which accounts for it being a box office flop, than a  swashbuckling comic rework of the old Anthony Hope PRISONER OF ZENDA story. So many good actors gone to waste, except for Oliver Reed's performance as Otto von Bismark which was super. Perhaps I expected too much, especially after viewing GMF's splendid screenplay adaptations of THE THREE MUSKETEERS/THE FOUR MUSKETEERS.I understand that the folks who filmed the SHARPE TV series are interested in doing a FLASHMAN series for British TV.

But it is black, black and black again and the hood is always very close, the hood of Boyz in the Hood and its crack and the execution of the little local gang leader by his associates including his protecting cop, and he finally comes back to get his vengeance, get even and recapture all his executioners and their next generation of children, including his own daughter. That does not make a film with a meaning, just some kind of thrilling entertainment, if you like blood and maggots, underground tunnels and skeletons in some kind of cabinet, or is it a cupboard or a closet? A little bit sad in a way because the situation and the theme could have produced a film with some insight in black imagination, in black white-induced schizophrenia, and it does not.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",N/A
1053243,"As most reviews have stated this set is worth owning if for no other reason to own ""Against All Flags"". I watched it for years on TV and waited anxiously for it to come out on DVD. When it did not come out in the two Errol Flynn sets I was very disappointed. This is by far a favorite of most Flynn fans. Those of us that especially like ""The Seahawk"", ""Captain Blood"", and ""The Master of Ballantrae"" love it. A must have. The others in this Pirates set are mindless fun too, just not inspirational enough to have me want to see the movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or go to Disneyworld to go on the ride as much as ""Against All Flags"". One other thing, the DVD is clear and sharp and the color in ""Against All Flags"" is so clean it looks like a new print.",Pirates of the Golden Age Movie Collection: (Against All Flags / Buccaneer's Girl / Yankee Buccaneer / Double Crossbones)
649271,"Since I've been with my wife I have to watch these rom-coms whether I like it or not.  Some of them are tolerable (""Under the Tuscan Sun"") or pretty good (""The Holiday"").  Alas, ""Music and Lyrics"" falls into the mundane category.  It starts off alright hitting bulls-eyes about eighties pop culture.  Hugh Grant is at his sarky self-depricating best here.  I thought quite possibly there's going to be a ""This Is Spinal Tap"" style parody.  Unfortunately, there's the most predictable love story afoot here.  Grant is a real pro at carrying this most average of material.  He should be doing more films like ""About a Boy"" instead of this formula product.  Drew Barrymore, appealing as she is, doesn't seem to have the acting heft to carry it off.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the target audience for this movie.  I deferred to my wife and she yawned and shrugged her shoulders with indifference.  I guess the jury has spoken.",Music and Lyrics

The hockey stick's making sense, too.  Okay, I still don't like Murphy.  I wish Valerie Cruz had been Susan Rodriguez and the cute, perky blonde who played Susan was Murphy.  So--I mostly ignore Murphy and concentrate on the things I love about this series.I hope this one lasts a long time, but my track record for picking winners on TV is very low.

1026817,"Good acting from both Aaron Eckhart & Helena Bonham Carter in this movie! Interesting split film cinematography throughout the entire film which gives  an interesting take on each character and gives the film an artsy feel.....This movie is slow to unfold and a bit boring overall! Both characters in this film begin talking during a wedding reception.... At first you think they don't know each other and are getting to know each other for the very first time...... It becomes apparent later on in this film that they were romantically involved years before hand, but have gone on to live separate lives..... The wedding is the first they have seen each other in years.Helena Bonham Carter's character, we find out, currently lives in London and is married to a cardiologist, while Aaron Eckhart's character is dating a much younger woman who is a dancer. I found it annoying that they keep referring to each other and their former lives together in the third person.Anyway, the two end up having a one night stand once the wedding reception is over and then Helena Bonham Carter's character returns home to London. It is apparent that Aaron Eckhart's character is still in love with Helena Bonham Carter's character and he wants her back. Sounds like Helena Bonham Carter's character was the one to end the relationship with Eckhart's character years ago, moved on in her life & she simply isn't in love with him anymore.",Conversation(s) With Other Women

992269,"As the other reviews attest, most users of the Tal Reinhart Facial Workout DVD will be women anxious to avoid plastic surgery (or reluctant or unwilling to consider it).  Facial musculature, and its slippage over time however, is identical for both sexes and few males can deny that if we're fortunate enough to last to ""a certain age"" (49 in my case) we could most likely benefit from this sort of a program.And the good news for us aging XY's is that if you can overcome your ""hell no I won't ask for directions"" stubbornness, this program can REALLY do you some good.  Tal Reinhart is not my first facial exercise guide; I've also done Carole Maggio and a couple other books, and those ARE helpful.  Nevertheless I would recommend this as the place to start.  First because VIDEO is by far the best way to learn these exercises.  Although I do the Carole Maggio workout faithfully I am never 100% sure I'm doing everything correctly.  Even the best descriptions and still photos can't demonstrate a facial move as well as video can.  Second because Tal Reinhart is VERY well organized and presented.  First time viewers can learn the individual exercises, practice them in isolation, then (quickly) advance to the full workout, offered without interruption at the end of the DVD.  This is an EXCELLENT way to organize the material and demonstrates considerable foresight on the part of the producers to optimize our use of this material.The first part of Tal Reinhart focuses on each individual exercise, explaining not only the technique but also showing via computer graphics how age and neglect cause facial muscles to sag.  It's a horror show indeed!  House of Wax part 2!  See once-supple faces turn into cranky grandmothers before your eyes!  More than anything else these visuals reinforce why facial exercise is IMPORTANT to personal self-confidence and general ongoing maintenance.  Indeed, if you're reading this, you are most likely getting much of that motivation already from your own saggy visage staring uncomfortably back at you every morning from the bathroom mirror.In addition to these eye-opening graphics (yes-intentional pun), the demonstrations are very slickly done and reasonably easy to follow.  It sure doesn't hurt that the individual exercise demos are split between three gorgeous young Israeli models (actually the entire production is from Israel) whose faces are alabaster perfection to begin with.  But who can fault the producers for using the beauty to which we aspire to motivate us?  All three ladies are well experienced in the exercises they are demonstrating and as indicated earlier are easy to follow along with.But the critical question is of course does it work?  My short answer is YES however I must qualify that response by adding that I am continuing with much of the Carole Maggio workout alongside this one so it's impossible to say where one leaves off and the other begins.  The eye & upper face exercises are MUCH more comprehensible in Reinhart than Carole's books so anything above the nose I credit to Reinhart.In evaluating this question we need to carefully consider exactly WHAT counts as success.  I realize no amount of exercise will shrink my Darth Vader helmet of a skull; I must also accept that pattern baldness is just an indignity that life commands me to endure, and like a woman refusing plastic surgery I will NEVER glue a rug to my scalp (or anything equally ridiculous).  In other words, my expectations have to be in line with what can be achieved.Even within those limitations I'm satisfied that the results justify the effort.  I started facial exercise (Maggio) back in June '06 and only picked up Reinhart in early '07.  I have been doing both daily and fairly quickly saw my face firm up and take on a chiseled shapeliness that certainly wouldn't have happened on its own.  Taming my tendency to a double chin has taken somewhat longer but with ongoing effort it is DEFINITELY receding and I'm convinced that this too is an important battle that can be won.  I am slightly amused by other reviewers complaining that facial workouts create more lines than they erase.  What you're seeing here (for the first time) is muscular definition; would you gripe if you could see a six pack on your abs after months of effort?  EVERY change I've observed on my own face has been an improvement!An IMPORTANT (and possibly overlooked) point made on the video is that the ""full routine"" closing the DVD serves as a basis for constructing your own personalized facial workout (the full routine on the video takes about 20 minutes).  In other words, don't just follow along with the ""full routine"" and wonder why things aren't shaping up as quickly as you'd like.  I suspect most men (like myself) will require extra work and effort to sharpen the mouth and jawline.  Be prepared to DO EXTRA reps for the areas you're particularly concerned about.  This is where it might be useful for you to have a second book or video for another perspective.  However I believe you CAN get good results using only the exercises demonstrated here, provided you'll customize your routine to match your needs.So then, fellow males, have I convinced you?  If you're not happy with the face you're showing then here's your best chance to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!",Tal Reinhart Facial Workout: Because the Muscles Don't End at the Neck

The storyline has enough to make you suspend your disbelief so that you can enjoy this underwater rollercoaster ride.  The acting is better than most in this genre and by actors we grow to like and understand.  Thomas Jane (Dreamcatcher), the film's hunky hero, looks incredibly like Christopher Lambert ofHighlanderfame and is very convincing in his role.  For you folks who like fun facts, he is currently married to Patricia Arquette of TV'sMedium.  Model and sometimes actress Saffron Burrows is surprisingly believable as the driven scientist who is motivated by noble reasons, saving people from Alzeimer's Disease, but who will sacrifice everything and everyone to do it.  Michael Rapport,The 6th DayandMen of Honor, and Samuel L. Jackson (do I really need to list his credits????? --lol), offer very solid support as does the comic relief of LL Cool J.Renny Harlin, no stranger to the action genre with hits likeDie Hard 2 - Die HarderandCliffhanger, keeps the pace exhilarating and managers to offer thrilling surprises in a somewhat tired genre.  In addition, the effects are impressive although obviously CGI.  The music is appropriate and even the absence of music at key moments enhances the suspenseful elements within the film when an over-the-top, pulse-pounding score might have been employed.While any shark film will inevitably be compared to Steven Spielberg'sJaws, this one should be judged on its own merits without that cumbersome comparison.

It faithfully re-creates the subtle, rustic, western tones that Mark Rydell was attempting to represent with the accurate color saturation you would expect from a high definition DVD.

626994,"""National Treasure"" is a horrible movie.  I knew within the first 60 seconds of watching that it was hokey and cliche, but I was willing to sit through it if it was at least entertaining.  It wasn't.  The one redeeming quality the movie could have had was the clues to the treasure.  Give the audience something to guess at.

653578,"I was originally going to skip this movie due to my utter disdain for Michael Bay and his paper-thin characters and over-the-top bombast. But I caved and went to see Transformers on opening weekend. It's safe to say that this was a project right up Bay's alley. After all, who was expecting riveting character development from a source material about alien robots who kick each other's butts? This project was destined to be a full-on spectacle and little else, which is why Bay is a perfect fit.Young teen Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) buys his first car only to discover that is actually a ""robot in disguise"" named Bumblebee and discovers his family ties to a government secret a hundred years old and an alien war thousands of years older. In the process, he manages to woo hottie Mikaela (Megan Fox, who must also be from another planet just because of how hot she is) and help the good guy Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) retrieve the coveted Allspark and defeat the evil Decepticons, whom are led by Megatron (voiced by Agent Smith himself, Hugo Weaving). Meanwhile, a group of nameless Marines consisting of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson aid in the battle against the Decepticons but add little else to the actual story and your typical, cliched ""goverment agency so secret that the rest of the government doesn't know it exists"" shows up, led by an apparently overacting John Tuturro. John Voight makes yet another appearance as a government suit, and comedian Bernie Mac and comedic actor Anthony Anderson appear to add your typical, cliched comic relief.The story seems basic aside from the occasional Transformers geek-speak and the ""boy and his robot"" vibe between Sam and Bumblebee smacks of Speilberg's touch (Speilberg is the producer), but there are plenty of characters here that are either cliches, add nothing to the story, or both. But the story isn't what makes this movie worth watching. No Michael Bay movie is worth watching for its story. After all, this is the guy who made the Pearl Harbor bombing into a Titanic-ripoff love story instead of using an actual story from the event's victims and survivors. So don't expect anything near Shakespeare here. The only real reason to watch this movie is for the fantastic special effects. So turn off your brain and enjoy.",Transformers

56708,"The Day of the Jackal, 1973 filmAugust 1962 was a stormy time for France. The OAS hated De Gaulle for giving independence to Algeria. They attempted to assassinate De Gaulle, but luck was still with Charles le Grand. The conspirators decided to hire a professional who is unknown in France. It is possible to assassinate De Gaulle, the trick is to get away to spend the pay-off. No notes must be kept, the OAS leaders must be carefully guarded until the job is done. The assassin begins to study his target, who will always be in public. This Jackal will create a valid but false identity using a dead person's name. We see his preparations for the job; we see the French Secret Service shadowing the OAS high command. The OAS planted a spy on a high-level Minister in Paris. ""Duggan"" arranged for another set of identity papers, then visits Paris to scout for a room on the top floor. August in Paris is vacation time; ""Duggan"" buys French clothes for his disguise.The French Secret Service captured the OAS messenger and interrogated him to get information. But they only learned the outline of the plot, not the details. The French need to identify the person who visited the OAS leaders for half an hour two months earlier! They contact foreign police for their informal cooperation. The film shows them investigating leads while ""Duggan"" continues his preparations. The film shows what is happening there is often little explanatory dialogue. ""Duggan"" figures how to find a place where his papers won't be checked, and how to disguise his white car. This stress takes a toll on ""Duggan"". The best-laid plans never allow for human error or the unexpected. The murder of Madame now makes this an ordinary crime of murder. But ""Duggan"" knows of a trick or two; he will not stay in a public hotel. The police are able tofigure out the new identity, and identify the Minister who leaked the information. ""Duggan"" silences another person who helped him. August 25 is the celebration of Liberation Day in Paris, a major French holiday. De Gaulle will appear for a speech and award medals. The scenes of a French parade reminds me of the parades of yesteryear.""Duggan"" reinvents himself disguised as a one-legged French veteran of the Resistance. He is able to pass the barriers for the public and enters an apartment house to go up to the top floor, then enter an empty apartment to prepare for the assassination. Detective Lebel checked with the police guards, and learned of the one-legged man. He takes this gendarme up to the top floor where they prevent the assassination. This film was a big hit for its dramatic story. The parallels to the assassination of JFK are obvious but unstated. Like other fast-paced films, you won't think of the implausibilities (the dependence on being able to pass a police barrier!). Would Detective Lebel take part in the search unarmed?

649735,"It would be so, so easy for director Sam Raimi to play it safe, remain formulaic and swing off into the sunset.  Fortunately, he and the screenwriters did not do that with SM3.I have read the other reviewers here chastising the number of villains in this movie, and the alleged ""watering-down"" affect.  Too much Tobey, too much action, too much romance, too much CGI.  To that I say...nonsense!  Ignore these reviews, some people will never be satisfied.SM3 is a fascinating look at a very basic human flaw...the desire for mercy and forgiveness vs. the unwillingness to grant it because of a lust for revenge.  Mix in Parker's impulsive naivete concerning matters of romance, and the tension that it creates with MJ, and you have the ingredients for an entertaining love story. Maguire, with his squeaky voice, is the perfect Spidey, and gangly Dunst, with her stringy hair and girl-next-door appeal plays a wonderful MJ.The story moves very quickly, briefly touching on many legends in the original Marvel Comics tales, as it must.  In a perfect world, we would have a dedicated movie to deal individually with Sandman, the alien symbiote, Venom, the new Goblin and Gwen Stacy.  That would be the only satisfactory result for many of the critics of this movie that you'll read here.But if you love Maguire and Dunst in their roles as I do, then you know that that just isn't practical.  If this is to be their last SM film, as has been strongly suggested, then bravo for this final installment from them.  Let other actors and directors and writers try to pick up the ball and run, and suffer the inevitable comparison and scorn from the critics (Batman, Superman, James Bond).  These two will always be Spidey and MJ, and they have set the bar high.As for SM3, we find satisfaction in friends reconciled, forgiveness given, personal demons conquered, the sorrow of loss and graceful love rekindled.  These actors are sure and comfortable in their roles, and the storyline does not fail them.  Add to that the wide open set-up for future installments, and SM lovers everywhere are left with hope.  Fear not, the plot is well done, easy to follow and compelling.  Only the cynics will repress the emotions aroused.",Spider-Man 3
352731,"I regret having to write this review, as I am normally a staunch defender of Leslie Nielsen's films and of the genres or parody and satire. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What is most astounding for a movie of this budget and quality is that not only did the producers rope Nielsen into this, but Patrick Macnee and Cindy Williams as well. Mercifully given the cast, the title is figurative and no actual nudity is featured in this travesty. The film was originally released in 1983 as ""The Creature Wasn't Nice,"" and has also been titled ""Spaceship."" It was apparently re-released periodically to capitalize on Nielsen's waxing and waning popularity.The film is a very lame spoof of all things sci-fi, and most directly of ""Alien."" The crew of a spaceship under the command of Leslie Nielsen lands on an alien planet and brings back a red jellied life form, making Dr. Stark (Macnee) ecstatic because he has finally found something to name after himself. Macnee gets my vote for most entertaining in the cast with a few decent lines; he is over the top here, but the material lets him down. Cindy Williams is the gratuitous female onboard, and performs what I thought was the worst song and dance number in screen history to entertain the crew. That record was eclipsed about twenty minutes later when the red jelly, now fully grown into a ridiculous gelatinous blob of mucilage, sings a song called ""I Want To Eat Your Face."" If this sounds entertaining, you might be wrong: it reminded me of when I had a wisdom tooth extracted by a military dentist.I won't divulge the fate of the cast, although I will say that as the cast was thinned I was increasingly enthusiastic as I knew that the film was counting down to the end. Before I conclude, I have to give special mention to Gerrit Graham who played Rodzinski. Graham's presence in this film absolutely ensured failure: he was supposed to be obnoxious, but in reality he was so grating that I was almost unable to finish the movie. I suppose this was the result the director wanted, but I can't figure out why. The Rodzinski character has the worst dialogue, never rising above the level of junior high school locker room banter, in this whole insipid mess and rarely have I disliked a character as much. The only other onscreen persona I can recall disliking this much is, uncoincidentally, also in this movie: the ship computer, ""Max,"" has a personality, and the personality is that of a bad AM disc jockey playing personal favorites. Need I say more?I love good satire and parody: I adored ""Airplane!"" and most of Nielsen's other work. I also like genuinely bad camp films, with Ed Wood being a personally favorite anti-genius. The problem here is that there are some relatively big names in a cast that is utterly wasted on the material: some things can't be saved, and this is one of them.For a much better horror spoof, I highly recommend the relatively recent ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra,"" which has a great cast, an entertaining story, and fidelity to the original genre being parodied.",Naked Space VHS

1028067,"Shyamalan's films are somewhat quirky and offbeat and very much draw upon his own idiosyncratic (but neither entirely original or totally out there) sense of what kinds of stories ought to be told. They usually don't conform to the standard Hollywood storytelling model, which means there are gaps and inconsistencies and odd duck characters and miscues that aren't entirely justified or the structure of the films is slanted without a clear &#34;beginning&#34; &#34;middle&#34; and &#34;end&#34; or where a &#34;twist&#34; takes the place of a genuinely motivated character arc -- in general in his case this is not a good thing but every once in a while it gives a fresh and unique edge to his films. &#34;Lady in the Water&#34; was no exception -- and it was clear from the beginning that Shyamalan didn't want to make concessions: he set up a cast of &#34;misfits&#34; and contrived a story that would bring them together under a common cause, and wasn't worried about mixing genres or stretching the limits of plausibility or giving his characters enough evidence for us to believe that they would believe in and embrace this cause at the peril of their lives. This is a story about abandoning oneself to believe in the power of stories, about suspending disbelief and letting the storyteller tell her story however ludicrous its implications become. (What is odd is that he seems to want to say that if we can just abandon ourselves to stories we will be better people and there will be less war, etc. -- but of course it is often the willingness to accept stories about &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; without fact that gets us so riled up about going to war in the first place). In any case there is something obviously self-serving and a bit naive about the premise of the story -- and the self-reference is as blatant as it can get in this film, since Shyamalan himself acted the part of the writer who was going to write a lot of strange things that would not be accepted at first but eventually would change the world through the power of belief (not to mention the one person who gets &#34;eaten&#34; in this film is a film critic who can't write anything himself but likes to criticize films for lacking neat plots and stories, i.e. one who wouldn't have liked &#34;The Village&#34; or this film). Still, as stories tinged with the fantastic go I enjoyed this one (it's a better film than &#34;Signs,&#34; which did much better at the box office). It worked even better for me on the small screen when I watched it again with a couple of my children on dvd. There I wasn't so bothered by the obviously grandiose delusions of the film (and its filmmaker) -- but just enjoyed, most of all, the undeniably fascinating and powerful performance at the heart of this film by Paul Giamatti, one of the most consistently strong supporting actors in Hollywood, here given center stage. Three stars for the film, and five stars for Giamatti give this film my four star rating.The way I think of M. Night Shyamalan's films is that he is like a small budget independent filmmaker who happens to have big budgets. This is sometimes good and sometimes bad. He tells small stories that appeal to a niche audience -- but luckily for him that niche has coincided with a fairly large number of Americans: mostly sci-fi/fantasy lovers and &#34;believers&#34; who like their fantasy movies to hint at transcendence (the afterlife, etc.) Where this is a drawback is that weaknesses in plot or limitations in scope or unconventional stories that you could forgive (or even celebrate as an alternative) in a small budget independent film are hard to accept in a glossy big budget feature put out by Disney or another major studio. Watching &#34;Signs,&#34; for example, it struck me that I would have liked it much better if it hadn't had such big name actors and hadn't obviously had such a large budget. It feels like a &#34;small film&#34; about a crisis of faith and an identity crisis, but its science fiction premise overwhelmed this rather than working seamlessly with it. (Unlike, say, Spielberg's &#34;Close Encounters&#34; -- a film that was able to manage both intimacy with the characters and a global science fiction premise). Shyamalan obviously has visual talent and the ability to coax exceptional performances from his actors and has been lucky enough to hit upon a few stories that resonated enough at the box office that he has been given free range for quite a few films. Plus, the studios he has worked for have had the good sense to market his films as being different and as expressing his unique vision. I don't know how much longer that is going to work for him, though -- with films like this one and his previous one that have had diminishing returns in the box office he may have to turn to creating the kinds of independent and low budget but high concept films that he would have been making if he hadn't had the good luck to have the right actors and the right kind of buzz that made &#34;Sixth Sense&#34; a smashing success.",N/A
345468,"The idea of this film that is considered by many as Bergman's crown achievement came to him in his house at Faro where he lived by himself for sometime in a melancholy state of mind after a rather painful breakup. One image kept coming to him and it was a very vivid and persistent image of a red room (red walls, red furniture) and four women sitting at the window in the room and dressed by the fashion of the beginning of the 20th century. He could not shake the image out of his mind and he knew that the only way to deal with it would be to start writing about the women - who were they, what was their relationship, their lives, their fates?.. He also knew that should the movie be made of his writing, the dominating color of it would be red. Bergman talked with affection and gratitude about his friend and long time collaborator Swen Nykwist who spent many days creating the passionate haunting red world of ""Cries and Whispers. The title came to Bergman from one of the reviews on a Mozart's sonata (he does not remember which one). The sonata was described as sounds of cries and whispers...""Cries and Whispers"" is about pain, death, love, lust, hate, and self-loathing. There are more than one scene in the film that I found unbearable, horrifying and depressing. In the same time, it is about beauty and power of life, every minute of it - how little we appreciated it until it is too late. Typical Bergman's subjects, Bergman's actresses giving amazing performances, strikingly beautiful - it even hurts your eyes cinematography by Sven Nykvist - typical Bergman's masterpiece - what less do we expect from him? I admire the brilliance of it: acting, cinematography, Bergman's simple but devastating approach to Death as an inevitable part of life. The ending is heartbreaking - with Harriet's face and her words from beyond the grave about appreciating every minute of life...Not my favorite but powerful and devastating film of the great master.",N/A
385131,"Make no mistake, this is a cheesy 1950's style science fiction movie in which aliens are invading and a prominent US scientist is singled out to be a sort of liaison.

This results in a real shooting war. Now the scientist must come up with a secret weapon that will allow earth to defend itself.The story is only mediocre but it is not really bad. The acting is fair but not spectacular. What are great are the special effects done by Ray Harryhausen.Harryhausen was noted for using stop animation and this was one of his earlier efforts. The effects would be nothing special today but, in their time, they were considered amazing.

80607,"Following closely behind Pocahontas, Little Mermaid was a favourite Disney movie of mine. I had the doll (with removable tail) and also the Eric doll - although I preferred my Ken doll.I still prefer the older Disney movies to the ones these days. These days, it's all about the celebrity voices, and how many you can spot before the credits roll. Back in the days of Little Mermaid, Cinderella etc, there are no celebrity voices. And it makes you slip into the movie easier, without having to think of the voice, before you can concentrate on the film.Little Mermaid still holds the magic it had for me when I was young. I remember being so scared when I was younger that I actually used to skip the bits featuring Ursula, the sea witch. Now, I laugh, but I still feel that same old fear. Especially the ending.

1072670,"Halfway through ""Dead Silence,"" I came to the conclusion that it was enjoyable because it can't be taken seriously. This is a wonderfully atmospheric horror film with a laughably preposterous story, so much so that it's actually a lot of fun to watch. Anyone who says that this film is bad is absolutely right. And no wonder; it was written by Leigh Whannell and directed by James Wan, the same men responsible for 2004's highly effective but equally preposterous ""Saw."" For this new film, they utilize all the best horror movie methods imaginable, from minimal lighting to unnerving close-ups to foggy, overgrown cemeteries. They've also crafted a plot without any degree of plausibility, especially when it comes to the obligatory twist ending; to say that the final revelation is overwhelmingly unrealistic would be an understatement. To say that it still succeeds in being shocking wouldn't be surprising.Can such a film be given any credit? Yes, but not in the way you might think; I have a strong feeling that the story was supposed to be ridiculous, if not for the sake of simplicity, then for the sake of making the disturbing visuals and pop out scares more effective. At the very least, this film actually has a story, which is more than I can say for hopeless fright fests like ""The Abandoned."" Made in the tradition of films like ""Child's Play"" and ""Puppet Master,"" ""Dead Silence"" is a ghost story that takes a beloved child-friendly activity--ventriloquism--and turns it into a horrific spectacle. Dummies have never been as frightening as they are in this film, with their smooth, pale skins and their large, unhinged jaws and their big, glassy eyes that seem to stare directly into the audience.It begins when Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife, Lisa (Laura Regan), receive a mysterious package. They open it to find a ventriloquist dummy crafted into a boy. The thing is damn creepy, to say the least, but it seems to have no effect on Lisa, who plays with it, talks to it, and even props it upright on her bed. Only when Jamie goes to pick up dinner does she discover the dummy's true nature, and by then, it's too late for her. First, a majority of the ambient noises go silent: a record player spins slower and slower until it stops; a whistling teakettle is muted, even as steam spews from the spout; a ticking clock goes quiet. All she can hear is her own breathing. That, and bizarre laughter coming from the bedroom.When Jamie returns, he finds his beloved wife propped up in bed, her mouth opened unnaturally wide and her tongue forcefully ripped out. Thus begins Jamie's nightmare, made worse by the fact that he's the prime suspect in his wife's murder. Assigned to his case is Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), a man who, for whatever reason, compulsively uses an electric shaver. He was so condescending that I just wanted to smack him upside the head; he speaks down to Jamie, showing him the same respect a bratty child would be shown. I suppose I shouldn't complain; every horror movie of this sort requires the annoying, intrusive side character, mostly because the audience takes pleasure in seeing him or her die at some point (whether or not Lipton dies, I'll leave for you to discover).Against Lipton's orders, Jamie returns to his ailing hometown of Raven's Fair for Lisa's funeral. He takes the mysterious dummy with him, apparently in order to ""get some answers"" (which translates as, ""only for the sake of plot advancement""). This is because he remembers a nursery rhyme he used to be told as a child: ""Beware the stare of Mary Shaw. / She had no children, only dolls. / And if you see her in your dream, / Be sure to never, ever scream."" The legend of Mary Shaw--an early twentieth century ventriloquist (Judith Roberts)--is no longer spoken of in Raven's Fair, according to Henry Walker (Michael Fairman) the town's aging mortician.Let's examine this legend. In the early 1940s, a local boy had gone missing. Because this boy had publicly humiliated Shaw during one of her shows (""I can see your lips moving!"" he shouts), the town immediately suspected that she had something to do with his disappearance. This prompts a group of vigilantes to take justice into their own hands, first by cutting out Shaw's tongue, second by murdering her. But nothing stays buried forever (literally); over the years, many people have been savagely murdered, each victim having his or her tongue ripped out. It would seem that, through her dummies, the ghost of Mary Shaw is ""silencing"" the families of those who murdered her.But how does this all connect with Jamie? He first turns to his father, Edward (Bob Gunton), for information, but he quickly sees that it's useless. For one thing, they haven't gotten along in years. For another thing, he's now wheelchair bound from a stroke, completely dependent on the care of his third wife, the sickeningly sweet Ella (Amber Valletta). It seems that Jamie's only resource is Henry; not only did he attend one of Shaw's shows as a boy, he also had an interesting encounter with her body as she was being prepped for burial. One would expect nothing less from this kind of film, especially since her final wish was to be transformed into a dummy. Can you imagine a human head with slits on both sides of the mouth and bulgy glass eyes?It was also her wish that each of her hundred or so dummies be buried. But they didn't stay buried for long, as Jamie and Lipton discover during the climactic sequence in Shaw's dilapidated theater. They also discover a book of sketches, specifically instructions on constructing handmade dummies. Attached is a flap of paper with the words ""How to Build the Perfect Dummy"" written on it. I won't say what it's in reference to, but I will say that it paves the way for the aforementioned twist ending, a moment that was both frightening and silly. Pretty much all of ""Dead Silence"" can be described the same way, which I believe was intentional on the filmmaker's part. It's horrifying to see a dummy turning to gaze at someone, especially when no one is operating it. Likewise, it's funny to hear lines like, ""There are things you remember, and then there are things you never forget."" Now that's truly the work of a gifted screenwriter.Yes, ""Dead Silence"" is a bad movie, but like many classic horror films, it's so bad that it's good. It's everything a story about possessed dummies should be, and no more. Whether or not this makes it worth recommending is open for debate; I'm giving it four stars because I had fun watching it, and because it succeeds in creating the right horror movie atmosphere. For some of you, this will not be enough, and that's certainly understandable; you have my permission to dismiss this movie and go in search of something more meaningful.",Dead Silence

908004,"Pom Poko, the ninth feature-length animated movie produced by Japan's Studio Ghibli, is a brilliantly-made film with a powerful message of how man's progress can sometimes impact nature in harmful ways.The raccoons (""tanuki"" in Japanese) of the Tama Hills are suffering from the encroachment of human civilization (in the form of new suburbs of Tokyo) into their habitats, so they decide to fight back.  Fortunately, the tanuki are one of the animal species in Japanese legend with the power to change shape.  They can replicate inanimate objects, other animals and even people.  The raccoons must learn to effectively use their abilities to dissuade the humans from destroying their homes.Isao Takahata - a colleague and mentor of the masterful Hayao Miyazaki - created a moving film that runs the full gamut of emotions; there are a lot of funny moments, but other scenes will definitely tug hard at your heartstrings.  Though the tanuki have these fantastic powers, their plight and anguish feel quite real... and the ending of the movie certainly reflects reality as well.  By the way, Tama New Town is a real place - built in the hills southwest of central Tokyo in the 1960's.The English dub is quite close to the original Japanese script (with a few cultural allowances), and the English voice actors did an excellent job.I would probably not recommend this film for really young children as there is quite a bit of death and violence associated with the raccoon struggle, and a tiny bit of implied birds-and-bees stuff.  The English dub creatively skirts around a sensitive issue related to the raccoons' reproductive organs.  If your children are old enough to understand the larger environmental message, however, I would have no reservations showing them this magical film.",Pom Poko
586915,"The first time I saw Mullholland Drive, I was impressed by it, but also more than a little confused, like many viewers, specially in the second part of the movie. After watching it two more times, I believe it is a true masterpiece, with a wonderful clockwork screenplay: many things that look arbitrary in a first viewing, came neatly into place after repeated sightings. The movie is structured in two parts (SPOILERS INCLUDED, don't read if you haven't yet seen it): a real part and a dream part. While the real part comes first chronologically, Lynch shows the dream first. In the ""real"" part, Diane (Naomi Watts) is one of those many girls that arrived in Hollywood from small towns throughout North America dreaming of getting a big break in the silver screen. Unfortunately for her, she is a mediocre actress. In a casting, she meets another actress called Camila (Laura Harring), who gets the main role. They become friends, get to live together, and eventually fall in love. Camila becomes successful in town, and she helps Diane in getting small roles in the movies she stars in. But Camila falls in love with one of her directors, Adam, so she and Diane splits bitterly. Some time later, Camila invites Diane to a party, where she is humiliated by the guests, and becomes silently enraged when Camila and Adam become engaged. In that party, she mets a few individuals (a man with a cowboy hat, Adam's mother) that would later appear in her dreams, in another roles. (Here Lynch deftly understands the logic of dreams, where people one knows usually appear under different names or roles). After the party, Diane hires a hit-man to kill Camila. He tells her that when the job is done, he will drop a blue key under her door. When Diane later finds the key and becomes aware than Camila is dead, she becomes remorseful, and shots herself. As she agonizes between life and death, Diane has a last dream, which is the first part of the movie. In the dream, Diane is the great actress she wishes she has been. As in the real part, she arrives in Hollywood for a movie career, but unlike reality, in the dream she is talented and successful. In her apartment, she founds an amnesic woman (who has the face of Camila). As for Adam, since she hates him for being engaged with Camila, she imagines him in horrible situations, cheated by his wife, being forced by mobsters in making his movies in a way he doesn't like. The cowboy Diane met at the party appears here as scaring Adam into picking another actress for the main role in the movie. The hit-man she hired is presented as impossibly clumsy, perhaps in her secret desire that he didn't do his job well. There are many things more, but I hope you get the idea of the structure present in the movie, and why it is not arbitrary but has its own impeccable logic. This is Lynch's best film, with a superb screenplay, and a nifty understanding of dream logic.",Mulholland Drive

1073072,"This is the Episode list for season 71. It Was a Dark and Stormy NightWhen his daughters return from an extended summer camp, Danny is disappointed to learn that they didn't seem to miss home too much. Later, when everyone learns that Michelle brought a wild rabbit home in her duffel bag, the girls happily ride back to the camp grounds with Steve to set the animal free. Unfortunately, when a severe thunderstorm hits, this unexpected little visit back to their ""home away from home"" becomes a little freakier than anyone expected. Meanwhile, Jesse and Becky's nightmares have been taking place before they fall asleep, because their rambunctious twin boys refuse to sleep in their own beds.2. The ApartmentDanny feels very uncomfortable with DJ going to Steve's new apartment. And to make matters worse DJ and Steve fall asleep watching TV. When they have no place to go to be alone to talk they climb into the cement truck that is in the backyard because Jesse and Joey are putting in a new driveway. Steve accidentally hits the lever that moves the shut and turns on the cement.3. Wrong Way TannerWhile Michelle is delighted to be playing on Coach Joey's soccer team, it is evident that she is not the natural athlete that her older sisters were at her age. Determined to see his little girl succeed, Danny pushes Michelle to practice her skills--only to cause further problems when Michelle unintentionally scores the winning goal for the other team. The youngest Tanner is prepared to quit soccer for good now, and it might require a team effort from the entire family to help her through her embarrassment. Meanwhile, Stephanie--who is putting together a special home video for school--uses her trademark sneakiness to catch each family member at some of their most humiliating moments.4. Tough LoveWhen kids are out of control it's time to say NO. That is what Becky and Jesse face when the boys are acting any way they want and nobody is telling them NO. Their behavior is effecting the whole Tanner household. Vicky fixes dinner for the family for the first time.5. Fast FriendsStephanie makes a new friend, Mickey. But Mickey's friends smoke and Stephanie is pressured to too. Will she?6. Smash Club: Next GenerationJesse has just inherited the Smash Club.

Danny is going through this in this episode when Michelle wants to start making decisions for herself and Danny has a hard time with this.8.  Another Opening, Another No ShowCappuccino machine not working, REM is not the REM they were expecting, Jesse is locked in the storage room... with Kimmy, Kimmy grabs Jesse toush, and a food critic. All on opening night at the Smash Club. What else could go wrong?9. The Day of the RhinoNo matter how old or young you are its never wrong to speak your mind when you have been ripped off by false advertising. This is the case for Michelle and all the other kids who sent away for a big Action Rigby toy and received a small plastic one that does nothing.10. The Prying GameMany people say things they regret later when they are angry. This was the case for DJ when she finds Stephanie and Kimmy hiding out in Steve's apartment. Stephanie's intentions were good but her actions were wrong. DJ says some mean things to Steph but later realizes her errors.11. The Bicycle ThiefA bicycle watch group is formed when Michelle reports that her bicycle is stolen. In a strange turn of events Danny, Jesse and Joey turn into the thieves by mistake.12.

The Perfect CoupleAs the new host of a couple's game show, Joey enlists the help of Jesse, Becky, Steve, DJ, Danny, and Vicky to be the contestants for a trial run episode. When Vicky cannot make it, Danny is paired with the loudmouthed Estelle. Juicier and more entertaining television is sought by causing the couples to argue in front of the camera, but the fun and games are over when, upon Vicky's return, she and Danny make a devastating decision about their engagement.14.  Is it True about StephaniePursued by a cute boy at school, Stephanie faces a problem with fellow classmate Gia, who also likes the same guy. In her refusal to put up with the girl's threats, Stephanie faces humiliation when Gia spreads a vicious rumor about her. Stephanie manages to plot quite an impressive comeback, but its impact on Gia makes the revenge less than sweet. Meanwhile, Danny--who is miserable without Vicky and desperate to avoid the painful memories--disrupts the natural flow of the household by rearranging everything.15. The TestDreams can seem so real as in the case for DJ who is worried about her SAT's. The test has her so nervous that she has a nightmare about the test.16. Joey's Funny ValentineBeing a comedian can sometimes be a challenging job as people expect you to be funny all the time. Roxie, Joey's new girlfriend tries to make a good impression on the Tanner family. Things don't go exactly as hoped.17. The Last DanceWhen Jesse's beloved grandfather Papouli arrives from Greece for a visit, the man fills the entire house with his loving and lighthearted perspective on life. The family is crushed when he dies in his sleep, but no one is more impacted than Jesse and Michelle, who are both struggling to reveal their true emotions. The bond between them is stronger than ever, however, and in the wake of this devastating tragedy, they just might be able to help each other heal.18.

If it does you miss out on so much other things.20. Michelle a la CartSoapbox Derby's are not just for boys any longer. Michelle proves this as she wants to enter the race. She not only wants to enter but she wants to win. Grownups must remember what they say even in a kidding manner that younger kids might take what they say to heart as Michelle did when Jesse, Becky and Danny were making jokes about a girl building a car.21. Be Your Own Best FriendMichelle learns a valuable lesson in this episode. She learns you can't buy friendship. She also learns you can have more then one best friend.22. A Date with FateIt's not when you celebrate ""Mothers Day"" when you are a kid its the thought behind it. DJ and Danny end up dateless at a restaurant that they both ended up at.23. Too Little Richard Too LateJoey points out at a PTA meeting in which he is running for president in that it's not who gives birth to the kids its the ones that are there for them when they are sick or sad.

Many of us think we know thetruth more than others because we are historians, teachers or historybuffs. We can research it to death as I have throughout my life andread all the books. (see ""Where Custer Fell"" by James S. Brust). But wecan't go back in time to 1876 and watch it unfold before our eyes andsee what really transpired.

1087329,"After a successful first year staring in January 2005, MEDIUM is now in its fourth year of interviewing ghosts and tracking down their killers.  It will return in January 2008.  When I first saw the trailers for the show, I didn't know if I would be all that interested.  After all, the concept of a psychic solving crimes isn't new and has been often times been nearly run into the ground by movies, books, and television episodes of characters that get haunted by apparitions.But ""Do you believe in ghosts?"" seems to be a popular perennial topic.  People love arguing over the afterlife and what shape it will take.  Interestingly enough, at the same time MEDIUM was airing, GHOST WHISPERER was already in development at another network.  GHOST WHISPERER focuses more on relationship-driven plots, but does occasionally deal with crime victims.From the very beginning, though, MEDIUM was all about the crimes.  Think of it as CSI with ghosts.  Court TV also offers PSYCHIC DETECTIVES, a reality-based recreation of criminal cases that were solved, or at least investigated, by real psychics.  There is plenty of interest in the subject, and the market doesn't appear to be nearing saturation yet.In fact, the show is based - somewhat - on the real life of Allison DuBois, a practicing psychic who once interned at the district attorney's office in Glendale, Arizona.  The character Allison DuBois, portrayed so charmingly by Patricia Arquette, is also a wife and mother of three daughters.  Haunted by her dreams and contacts with the afterlife, Allison is drawn to solving crimes.  In the opening season, she was met with staunch resistance but eventually won a position in the district attorney's office.Now in this third season DVD collection, Allison is an old hand at shepherding ghosts and solving crimes.  As she's gone along, though, the crimes have gotten more personal and hit closer to home.  Jake Weber plays Allison's husband, Joe.  He's, literally, a rocket scientist.  Together, they couldn't come from more different backgrounds, but they make everything work.  Their relationship is the backbone of this show, and Jake's reaction and struggles with dealing with Allison's ""gift"" is what brings me back again and again.I love how the whole family gets along.  Joe is adrift in a sea of estrogen and female stress, yet he's got his own problems as he battles job pressures and Allison's dreams that haunt them both at night.  Not only that, but the stress that Allison and his kids bring into his life isn't something he can talk about with any of his work buddies.  Allison is the hero of the show, but Joe is my personal hero.  The way he deals with everything, the way he's just one inch away from constantly being overwhelmed, makes me root for him all the time.Season 3 brings a lot of the action into the family arena.  The past couple episodes have touched on the family, but as the girls have gotten older and come into their own powers, more emphasis has been placed on that.  The girls - Bridgette, Ariel, and Marie - are amazing in their own right.  They're not perfect.  I like the fact that they come across as real kids with real issues and real rebellion at times.  Marie is played by Madison and Miranda Carabello.  Bridgette is played by Maria Lark.  Ariel is played by fan-favorite Sofia Vassilieva.The season opener is a two-part story, ""Four Dreams Part 1"" and ""Four Dreams Part 2"", has Allison and Bridgette working together to solve one of Allison's cases.  Marie's problems surface in ""Profiles in Terror"" and tie into Allison's battle with an abrasive FBI profiler whose findings don't agree with hers.  ""Mother's Little Helper"" focuses on Allison and Ariel as they share dreams.  One of the strongest episodes of the season is ""Second Opinion"" because it involves the possible future Marie, and Allison's fears.  Those fears are the same ones faced by many parents in the world today.  This one hit especially close to home for me because I've had to deal with a cancer scare with my own daughter.  This is the kind of writing that makes an episode of MEDIUM double-down with excitement and emotional weight.The episodes involving the volatile relationship Joe and Allison share are the best.  That relationship gets touched on in ""Ghost in the Machine"" as the result of a camera Allison gets for Joe as a present.  The idea of a camera (although it's a camcorder in this case) that can show images from the future or past isn't new, but the episode still manages to throw an edge on the story.  ""Apocalypse, Push"" reunites Allison with the Texas Ranger she first helped in the series' premiere episode, but it also features Joe as he has to deal with issues that again make him a real character to me and the show's fans.  ""Very Merry Maggie"" has Joe worrying about his health, and Allison is so busy that she can't give his situation or mental drain the attention she otherwise would.The best of the Joe-centric episodes come at the end of the season, though.  In ""Joe Day Afternoon,"" Joe gets held hostage at his job.  The problems he has to deal with as a result crop up again in ""No One To Watch Over Me"" as he has to go back to work and still has a lot of residual fear.  ""Head Games"" and ""Heads Will Roll"" features Joe's decision whether to join a lawsuit against his employer.  I love Joe.  My heart goes out to him.  I know he's a fictional character, but Weber just plays him so well that I believe if he really existed, this is just how he would be.In addition to her husband and daughters, Allison also has a brother.  Michael has some of the same powers Allison has.  He's featured in ""1-900-Lucky"" where his job as a hot-line psychic leads him into the same crime investigation Allison's already working on.When the family isn't featured in the spotlight so much, the season relied on the fabulous and intriguing natures of the crimes Allison becomes involved with.  ""Be Kind, Rewind"" slams Allison with haunting dreams about losing her legs, and plays the emotional card that brings in the viewers.  Dr. Charles Walker, Allison's recurring foe that first appeared in first season's ""Penny for Your Thoughts,"" puts in an appearance in this season's ""Blood Relation.""  These episodes are always chilling.""The Whole Truth"" is a heartbreaker because it involves Allison's search for a little boy.  These episodes where a ticking clock is involved always fuels the interest and I can't help but love them.  ""Better Off Dead"" has a twist involving ghosts that is fantastic and fun.  ""Very Merry Maggie"" is creepy, and shows how much the series can bounce back and forth between fun, interesting, and downright scary.""The One Behind the Wheel"" puts Allison at risk, and those episodes are always crowd pleasers.  I can't help but be more interested when Allison is menaced.  No matter what the other people in her life think, she's always alone ultimately.  ""We Had a Dream"" has a psychic killer who tracks her down to her home.  Allison's younger self puts in an appearance in ""The Boy Next Door"" and gives viewers a glimpse of what her life was like as she was growing up.  ""Whatever Possessed You"" has two investigations that ultimately pull together in a surprising way.The final three episodes of the season pull a lot of things together and build a larger, more emotional story.  ""Head Games,"" ""Heads Will Roll,"" and ""Everything Comes to a Head"" builds tension and the threat level to Allison, Joe, and their marriage as outside pressures threaten to cave in on them.  And Allison has to go outside her normal activities to bring a killer to justice.MEDIUM is an amazing show.  I love the episodes because most of them are self-contained and don't require constant attention to the series to understand what's going on.  You can dip in and out of the season and keep up - except for the continued shows.  But that's what I pick the DVD sets up for: to see the episodes I might have inadvertently missed and to revisit favorite episodes.If you're a fan of the series, the third season set is out and keep the same great standards as the first two sets.  If you haven't seen the series before, this season rounds out the series and makes the characters even stronger than before.  You can start here with this one and know what's going on.Unfortunately, special features are almost non-existent.  I would love to see some behind-the-scenes stuff, some interviews with the real Allison DuBois and maybe the district attorney she worked for, as well as background on real-life cases that the medium solved.  I love the show, but I would love finding out more about the real person it's based on as well.",Medium: Season 3
717809,"The first three movies in the ""Thief In The Night"" series kept getting better.  But then they released this hurried fourth installment, which was the worst of the group.I get the impression that the movie was made so they could finish the story, not because there was a real need for another installment.  It in fact was designed to be shown in two parts.  The first part had a summary of the first three movies (which was not true with the second and third of the series), and the second part reviewed the first part.Add to this that the special effects were not that special.  True, I watched this the same day I saw ""Return Of The Jedi"", so it had a lot to live up to.  But there was one scene at the end that obviously was a minature -- it did not look real.Allow me to say, though, that this movie wasn't without entertainment value.  There was an effective mystery on who was tipping the bad guys about the protagonists' whereabouts.  There was an introduction to ""The Doomsday People"", who had been burned somehow.  There was some humor, as with the other movies as well.  But it paled when compared to the first three movies.",N/A

1043516,"When I saw the previews for Flags of Our Fathers, I was excited for a couple of reasons.  First, I am a World War II buff, but have studied the European theater and want to know more about the war in the Pacific - the so-called American War, as it was linked directly to an attack on Americans at Pearl Harbor.Secondly, my great uncle was a Marine involved in the island hopping campaign to reach Japan.  I have heard stories of what it was like and wanted this film to add to those stories.While there were parts of the film that were interesting, the information was not woven together in a cohesive final product.  Little vignettes of action that were supposed to help tell the story of the fight for Iwo Jima end up being snippets of what is really one of the most compelling fights in American history, and the definitive Marine battle of all time.When you read the book, you really understand why the fight for Iwo was so important.  You find out why 70,000 men were sent to this little spit of land to fight and die.  The atrocities committed by the Japanese both before and during World War II are explained and add a prelude to the hell that the Marines knew they would face once they reached the beaches.The structure of the island fortress - considered one of the most heavily armed fortresses in history - is explained, giving the feeling that the Marines were lucky to win the battle, even after 36 days of tortuous fighting.The idea that the picture of the flag raising could give a nation hope is understandable, especially given the era and the painful four years leading up to the battle.But the film - well, it just goes off in it's own direction, with Clint Eastwood's help of course.  Where do I begin?  Well, war is hell and not as simple as it seems from the history books.  OK - got that.  These men were not looking to be set up as heroes, but were thrust into the spotlight for the good of a voracious government war machine that needed heroes to convince the public to continue financing a horrendously expense battle for the benefit of the free world.  Check.  Life back home was not a bed of roses.  Roger.But none of that really tells the story of what happened at Iwo Jima.  It doesn't even really tell the story of what happened to these three boys at Iwo Jima.  It touches on the issue, but it leaves the battle as a secondary item on Eastwood's agenda, which seems to be to tell us that our young soldiers end up as grist for the public mill.  That the press uses a good story for it's own benefit, even if the truth must be distorted a bit.  That the government doesn't really care about the real truth as long as it can use the boys for propaganda purposes.Well, in case no one understands the history of WWII, the fight was one we had to win.  The Japanese military leaders were murderous in their techniques, their teachings, and their actions.  Find the book and read the section about the slaughter in China, before we entered the war, where 350,000 civilians were slaughtered in one month (correct, one month).If three young men could capture the hearts of the American people and move the war to a speedier conclusion, then that was more important than those three men and their privacy or personal feelings.  As Marines who professed to be fighting for the sake of their fellow Marines, they should have understood that wars are won (and fellow soldiers saved) on the home front as well as on the battlefield.  The personal sacrifices of the publicity tour at home were a small price to pay for the thousands of lives saved due to a shortened war.If only Clint Eastwood had been able to clarify that issue.  Instead he seems to want to show us that these poor pitiful boys were just pawns in the hands of the Corp and the US government.  What a wasted opportunity, however politically correct in this current age.",N/A
276254,"The Battle of Britain was one of the pivotal historical events of the last century, when an outnumbered few airmen barely held off the largest military juggernaut of the time. Being a serious history buff of the era, I believe this film captures the essentials in a very compelling way. One can always quibble over details, but the direction, acting, and action sequences are the best possible at the time of its production. Most compelling to me is Sir Laurence Olivier's riveting depiction of Air Chief Marshal Dowding, an ascetic stuffy personality that is credited with the grand air strategy that won the battle. No grandstanding here.. a very honest portrayal.Where the film falls short is understandably in the effects department. The air combat sequences lack the kind of cohesive realism of later films, but the storytelling is solid and the musical score makes all the difference. In the hands of a Steven Spielberg with today's digital visualisation technology, the sequences would be far more compelling, but for the period, they were the best that one could expect.In the making of the film, the limited ability of special effects at that time made the filmmakers crash and destroy several actual WW2 aircraft during production to achieve a level of realism. Today, such aircraft are nearly priceless and no-one would think of destroying any during the production of a film. The fate of numerous Heinkel 111's that met their end in crash sequences would never be repeated today. But even at the time of production, genuine German-made ME-109s were unobtainable, and the filmmakers had to rely on a fleet of Spanish Air Force post-WW2 109-derived aircraft for the sequences. Only a historical nitpicker would notice as I did, but in nearly every other historical respect, they got it right. A small but telling detail is that the British Hawker Hurricanes in the film accurately experience an engine hiccup when they roll inverted, due to fuel interruption in their gravity-fed carburetors.Being a fan of WW2 films, this is one of the best ever despite its age. Unlike most other WW2 films of the time, this one still sparkles through the superb acting of its all-star cast and a well-written screenplay.",N/A

It wants some face-time. It wants to get a place on your lunch calendar, maybe talk about better digs than the attic, certainly get a generous raise in its CGI allowance, that sort of thing. But give the American ghost a little quality time---you know, try to figure out why the damned thing shows up at 3 am in the upper servant's belfry flapping its be-sheeted arms and clanking around in its moldering leg-irons---and you're gonna be OK with the American ghost.The Japanese ghost---that's another story.

It doesn't even have time for CGI, or sheets, or even chains: that would just get in the way of its main order of business, which is twofold:#1)unleashing ghost jihad on you; and#2) ruining your [expletive].In that order. Rinse, repeat. Sometimes the Japanese ghost gets so busy doing #2 that it doesn't have time for #1, & vice versa.Rest assured, though, that unlike the American ghost, there is no negotiating, no ceasefire, no white flags, no peace talks, with the Japanese ghost. Ever. It will not be satisfied until you are:a)fruitbat crazy insane in some institution with flickery lighting and lots of shadowy corners, where the Japanese ghost can show up at opportune moments to pay its respects;b) dead in the most unpleasant way possible, including looking, post-necrosis, like you died taking a dump your Depends;c)driven to take your life in some impressive fashion, like eating a blowtorch or gumming your lips and nostrils together with Krazy Glue.d) all of the aboveThat's pretty much ""The Grudge 2"", which will work for you to the extent you're willing to kick back, take a load off, have a swig of piping hot sake, and relax about minor things like plot & acting.""The Grudge 2""---which is an American remake of the, um, original sequel, only the whole rationale for the remake eludes me, since the movie is shot by its original director Takashi Shimizu, takes place in Japan, and features a Japanese Ghost. Actually, it features a passle of 'em. But whatever: it's Exhibit A of the phenomenon we were just discussing, Nasty Japanese Ghost Syndrome.Here's the plot, summed up, in a nutshell: this trio of plummy schoolgirls, on a dare, walks up to the house from Grudge 1, now all sooty-black from the fire, curled up on its haunches in some Tokyo backstreet, and the Thing looks damned Hungry.Director Takashi Shimizu is a master when it comes to setting up shots of smoldering, quiet malevolence, and here the House practically breathes menace: ""Feed Me"".So it's a haunted house flick. I mean, in the real sense of the word. a haunted house that sorta takes the whole ""think global, act local"", and turns it on its head. It exports. It mass markets. It's a consumer business with international shipping, baby!I could bore you with plot---which jumps around through time and, whatever anyone else says, is perfectly easy to follow, unless you're a moron. Whatever: it's godawful scary. It's scary in a deep, dark, pungent, nasty atavistic way. What do I mean by that?Let's step back. This movie requires a few ingredients: 1) watch it alone 2) in a dark house, maybe with the faucet, somewhere, drip drip dripping 3) after you watch it, you tuck yourself in for the night.And then the film's deep, irrational, crazy nuggets of terror will come back to tuck you in, with big, warty, water-soaked clammy hands. To give you a little goodnight kiss. To ruin your sleep.Why? Because the Japanese Ghost does everything you don't want a ghost to *every* do, especially if it's late at night, and there are dubious sounds out there. Think of it: you don't want the ghost to show up anywhere near your bed: the Grudge spook shows up under the covers. Under your desk. On *top* of your desk when you're hiding in the little cubbyhole, enabling you to get a good feel of its graveyard-cold ankle.So that's it: ""Grudge2"" plays out like a demo-reel of all the most godawful shark-eye black widow venom hornet sting nasty scariness you can imagine, and it will work if you just lay back and let the spooky, creepy crawly malevolence just roll over you.Creepy & deliciously menacing, Grudge 2 is well worth checking out in the dark, and brings an entirely new meaning to the phrase ""House Hunting"".JSG",N/A
247592,"One of Fellini's most accessible films (his use of color really helps), he once again plays reality against an active fantasy life... fantasies that combine memory, fears, fleeting desires and the way we imagine the lives of others.  For me, one of the things that makes a film 5 star is that it provides something that only film can provide, and this is it; while the presentation is very theatrical, this quick intercutting of time/memory/mood can only be done in film.While the overall message is a very conservative (pre/anti-feminist) one of it's day, Fellini DOES liberate a woman's fantasy life, and this is the essence of his leading ""little woman.""  The predominant action of the film is in her imagination.This was the day when middle/upper class Italian women did not work, and Masina represents the ""good little woman.""  Rich enough to have servants, there was little to occupy her time or mind, other than similar friends who have veered to the outre and wierd just to have something to do.  Masina's character searches more internally, and her fantasies color her vision of the lives of others.  (Note that her usual circle of friends are equated with a fantasy of death, and you'll be clued into her psyche as these begin.)I think you have to have lived a bit to ""get"" Fellini - I didn't like his work when I was younger - I love this.  Also note his use of color as ""percieved color"" not literal color and this is worth many viewings.And finally, if you are a larger woman... nothing makes you feel so great about being a large woman as watching Fellini's glorious Amazons!",N/A

(It's great to be a pessimist...you're either proven right or pleasantly surprised).  It it quite possible that I am simply too gullible; however, I was kept guessing until the very end.When I say ""WONDERFUL movie, Little Diamond in the Rough,"" I'm not talking about a potential Oscar-winner.  I mean that Cry Wolf is a 1-karat horror diamond: not something everyone oggles at, but definitely valuable.  It is a neat, taut, well-written mystery that relies on story and character rather than gore and special effects (not that there isn't blood, though!).If you're a die-hard splatter fan, looking for gory, nauseating scenes of horrific carnage and human torture, then don't buy Cry Wolf.  Buy Hostel or Ichi the Killer instead (also great movies!).If you want something to really scare the living daylights out of you, then I also do not suggest this movie -- get Session 9 or Ju-On or Ringu (or, alternatively, in the case of the latter two, their American counterparts, The Grudge and The Ring).  This movie is great, but it won't leave you sleeping with the lights on.If you are a TRUE horror fan, however (or if you just like good suspense movies without the gore) -- do not hesitate to get Cry Wolf.

Michael Cain has a small role as the most ""excellent"" best friend. Julianne Moore plays the girlfriend but don't go to see her if you're a fan. It's a very small part.

317275,"The third Roger Moore outing as Bond has some terific moments in it, that rank with some of the best in all the Bond films. The start in particular is fabulous. Bond leaves a mountain lodge and starts skiing down the mountain and is then pursued by 4 or 5 Russian agents. Bonds escape is breathtaking and was done for real (no CGI in 1977). Check the credits for the stunt-man who gets a special mention. There are other great moments as well, such as the Lotus Esprit and the first appearance by Richard Kiel as Jaws.This film repeats various elements from previous Bond films such as the fight on the train from 'From Russia with Love', the Lotus Espriteis effectively the Aston from 'Goldfinger' etc. For me though the main reason it isn't worthy of 4 or more stars is the less serious nature of the film. Roger Moore uses that irratating smile a few too many times, and the film maintains a jokey attitude throughout. To be fair its better than most of the Roger Moore Bond films that followed, where this jokey attitude got worse and worse (and Roger Moore becane too old for the part as well).However, the script is pretty good, and the sets are very impressive so overall this IS an entertaining Bond film, but not one you can take seriously.",N/A

After watching the horrible Die Another Day I was a little afraid to watch Casino Royale. I took a risk and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed this movie. This latest movie brings much needed life in to the James Bond Franchise which over the past few years had lost its edge. This is a new and improved Bond played by Daniel Craig. Daniel gives a great performance as 007, and his character actually has emotions and is not portrayed as this one dimensional robot like the previous films. The action scenes in this movie are great, and to see James Bond fall in love just adds to the drama of this movie.  I don't want to give the movie away so I will say no more. This movie has some slow moments in it, but for the most part it is a good, entertaining, action packed movie. The Blu-ray disc picture looks amazing in true 1080p HD, and the sound is top notch as well if you choose the linear PCM 5.1 soundtrack.

1079600,"This is a true gem of a movie that has tremendous depth, exploring sensitive topics like teen sex, teen pregnancy,its repercussions and fears that accompany women through marriage & motherhood. The subject matter is controversial but in the hands of capable writer-director Hilary Brougher, the story is told with clarity, poignancy and sensitivity.The story centers around Stephanie Daley, a 16 year old teenager who is accused of murdering her newborn infant daughter whilst on a school ski trip. The role is played to perfection by Amber Tamblyn, and her portrayal of a shy adolescent trying to find a social niche at school is at times hard to watch, though played with a high level of credibility. The flashbacks of Stephanie recalling the past, especially the public restroom scene of the birth itself is something one will not soon forget, and Amber Tamblyn portrays the teen's pain, horror and shame to chilling effect.The other main role, that of forensic psychologist Lydia Crane is played by Tilda Swinton. Lydia herself is five months pregnant, and beset with doubts about her impending motherhood [having suffered a stillbirth a year ago] and also the strains on her emotionally fragile marriage [husband is played by Timothy Hutton]. Lydia's job is to evaluate Stephanie's mental capacity before a competency hearing. Swinton is well-cast as the emotionally fragile Crane, but ultimately her problems do not seem to be as serious as the ones facing young Stephanie. It is indeed to Tamblyn's credit that she makes the viewer care so much more about Stephanie and wanting to see how she comes out of the crisis. Throughout Stephanie's sessions with Crane, and especially in the flashbacks, one feels a strong sense of sympathy for the fragile teen who seems lost and frightened, and increasingly isolated.All in all, Stephanie Daley is a compelling human drama that portrays a sensitive topic with unflinching and painful honesty. Highly recommended!",Stephanie Daley
247154,"I've seen this movie 7 or 8 times and it still cracks me up. This is my favorite comedy of all time. The cast choice was great, I never thought of Arsenio Hall as an actor but he was great in this movie, the make-up in the movie was truly ahead of their time to the point you couldn't even tell that they (Eddie and Arsenio) were in make-up. All of the characters were funny, but I actually ached from laughter in scenes with Arsenio's preacher and in the Barber shop. That alone would be enough, but there's more. James from Good Times - John Amos and Mister Soul Glow himself - Eric LaSalle put in excellent performances as well.Unfortunately, the critics and The Academy didn't think much of this film. I guess the ultra-rich African theme didn't appeal to some. I wish there were more movies out now like this movie.

975730,"Being a fan of the 1990's Animated Series (and finally locating the entire series collection after years of searching) I have to say that Evolution is not only different; it is in many ways better.  Critics complain of the teenage persona of many long-standing heroes but (and this comes directly after digging out my old comics and 1990's Animated Series collection) the show's writers clearly understand the characters in question.The third season actually starts to look and feel closer to the ""typical"" stage of the X-Men universe in that the scope of their struggles is suddenly much larger than the high school principal or the Brotherhood.  Battles with Sentinels result in the world's attention toward the mutant epidemic and most of it isn't favorable.  Wolverine has been steadily evolving into the brute we all know and love while Scott (Cyclops) also shows more of his qualities as team leader. Iceman starts to get some screen time while some of the lesser known mutants (like Jubilee) end up getting removed here in the third season.Overall, this is a very well packaged set complete with some interesting extras from the show's creators.  In case you aren't already aware, the show went on to a 4th and final season. Hopefully we can expect the same type of treatment for that as well.",N/A

Certainly he gives it a spin that Little Nicky nor his dad could conjure.  He makes the movie worth watching and he certainly had the biggest slice of the costume budget.  Surprisingly, John Allen Nelson,(currently on 24) one of the endless supply of Soap Hunks seemingly available on demand at any given time in any given decade, gives a meaty (couldn't resist it) performance that is full of charm and wit. Steve Levitt acquits himself perfectly as the pre- and post- transformation nerd. Even CoCo had to watch out for the scene stealing vamping of Deborah Shelton (Body Double) as the assistant from Hell (literally).  Of course watch for Robert Morse in a drier than the Sahara perf.

It is one of those films I would describe as an ""enjoyable little film"".The film does not try to be something it is not; it is a story about two women at a crossroads in their separate lives and how friendship can move them past tragedies in their lives.The two lead characters are interesting in that you have an American lady who has closed herself off from everyone who wants to help her after the death of her son.  We also have an Irish lady (Ria) who after finding out about her husband's infidelity looks to friends and family for support, only to find they blame her for his affairs (or at least that is how she feels). By switching lives for short period of time they both hope they can find the answers they need.The story is entertaining and I enjoyed the performances by most of the supporting actors.  Unfortunately I did not enjoy the performances of the leading actors; Andie McDowell and Olivia Williams.  Andie's performance just did not seem to fit this character.  There were moments when her character would look into the camera and you would expect her to convey the emotion of the moment, but it was not there.I think part of the problem may have been with the directing or the storytelling.  Their seemed to be pieces missing, especially in Ria's life in America.  I have not read the book so if there are parts of the story missing they were lost in the movie.Neither of the lead women seemed to capture the tragedies that happened in their lives, they just seemed odd.  I see this movie mainly appealing to those who like romantic comedies.  If you do, or you are an Andie McDowell fan, then you will enjoy this movie.",Tara Road

208776,"I enjoy watching this film when it comes my way. Robin Williams probably won't be remembered for his role as Popeye; yet he turns in a fine performance. Bringing to life an animated character, he gives us a terrific performance in the title role. He is completely convincing even with his big realistic brawny forearms, trademark of his character. Mr. Williams ironically takes a subtle approach on his characterization of Popeye, relying less on his all out persona and focusing instead in the parental sweetness of his character when dealing with his new found son Sweet Pea and in relating romantically with Olive Oyl. Which leads us to talk about Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl. Basically she was born to have this role. Duvall brings the perfect blend of goofiness and even dignity to the role. When on screen is very hard not to take away your eyes from her. One of the highlights of the film is when she sings all by herself on a moonlit pier the silly ditty ""He Needs Me"" and the movie soars with a whimsical understated charm that is both memorable and wonderful.The movie also accomplishes wonderful nutty moments and does an amazing job of capturing the spirit of a live action cartoon without thankfully the need of any CGI effects. Much credit should be given to the work of Wolf Kroeger, the production designer, who has come up with a spectacular physical universe. His Sweethaven set, built on location on the island of Malta consists of a detailed and atmospheric fishing village where streets run at crazy angles and all the buildings lean together dangerously on the coast side. The music score by the late Harry Nilsson is weaved in into the plot without appearing forced and although there are no obvious show stoppers there are a few clever melodies, most memorable the already mentioned ""He Needs Me"", ""Food, Food, Food"" and the opening anthem ""Sweet haven"" in which a gloomy sarcasm must be noted.Popeye is a mix bag of wacky elements that suffers from some uneven pacing but at times it is gloriously weird, visually spectacular and brimming with intelligence. I recommend it to those who enjoy unpredictable and unusual entertainment that's not neatly package in a square box. To me that kind of packaging sometimes have the best surprises.",Popeye

In the case of ""No Country for Old Men"", they are very much at the thriller end.The basic plot is that Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across a scene of carnage whilst in the Texas backwoods hunting for antelope.  There are multiple bodies (both human and canine), a huge haul of drugs and a bag containing $2 million in bank notes.  Moss takes the notes and returns home before making the questionable decision of returning to the scene.  It is at this point that his life makes a decided turn for the worse.

664944,"It really is a great film! I'm so glad that I came accross it because it was a complete accident.  I'd never heard anything about the film before, and knowing that sports movies could be really good or really awful, I was hesitant to pick this up.  But being a lifelong baseball fan and being that it was only $6, I decided right before I walked out the door at MovieStop to turn back and buy it.Anybody who watches the Yankees on TV knows that Billy Crystal is a familiar face at the Stadium, whether it's April or October, and bringing what was certainly the most cherished baseball season of his youth to life, albiet not on the big screen, has to have been a huge thrill for him.  He did a wonderful job of it too.Although I was not alive at the time, the setting seems to be a flawless throwback to the early 60's, right down to the appearence of Yankee Stadium before its renovations in the mid 70's.  I was actually suprised to learn that it was filmed in Tiger Stadium, because Crystal and his entire crew had made it come alive with the true aura of the Bronx. The acting in the film is superb and throughout I couldn't get over how similar Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane looked to Maris and Mantle.The film really brings to light what Roger Maris had to go through, being the soft-spoken guy who the press often considered surly (sound familiar?), he was far from the fan favorite in the Bronx, even though he was clearly their most dangerous hitter that year and one of the key features in that championship season.  It is just a crime that it took more than 30 years after the record was broken for it to be officially recognized as baseball single-season home run record (Babe Ruth had hit 60 in a 154 game season, while Maris only had 59 at that point), and that Maris was not alive to see it.I would highly reccomend 61*, even to Red Sox fans.The bonus area on the DVD is exceptional, with commentary from Crystal and all kinds of behind the scenes stuff about the making of the movie and who and what went into its production.",N/A
647890,"Beware of any linear explanation of The Fountain.  It is difficult to definitely tell the plot. It is a little chamber piece that happens to be a nice movie.  This nonlinear fable reminds me mostly of a Robin Williams movie, Being Human and somewhat another by the same actor titled What Dreams May Come. 2001: A Space Odyssey also comes to mind, too.  It is a love story that goes cosmic, breaking through the fabric of the physical world and astral science exploring a spiritual plain.  I was expecting something more conventional in love stories and science fiction.  The opening of the movie pretty much dashed that to the rocks but in a good way demanding my mind to loosen up and go for a ride. Mayan astronomy and a fiction being written are the vehicles for bending reality. The language is not just speech but shapes, pictures, light.Hugh Jackman has to perform more emotion in this movie than the other characters and other parts he has played. He succeeds at showing a lot of range and selling this notion to us.  Rachel Weisz plays an idea wonderfully, female characters that aren't women like the rest of us. (She mostly just has to look good and fit into the story, which can be tricky because she projects a lot of presence.)  The acting is intelligent and interesting.As for production, it is admirable. In the documentary footage of how the movie was born, Darren Aronofsky and his colleagues were on a journey that burst into something different than they had originally conceived. It is hard to decribe this film accurately.  I hope these notes are helpful. It does and will provoke more and more thought for thoughtful people.",N/A

1059460,"This is a true kids movie but I had fun watching it with my 4 year old granddaughter and 14 year old son.  It was most entertaining for my granddaughter and not very scary.  She had seen it in the theatre with her mom and dad so she was telling us when the ""scary"" parts were.  Our 14 year old was entertained but a little bored as he quickly pointed out the (many) plot holes!!The overly done divorced parents with the dad having either no job or being a so-called entrepreneur was not a theme I enjoyed and I did not feel very sympathetic to either Ben Stiller as the dad (Larry Daley) or his son who seemed to go with his ""step dad"" without much problem.  However, the machinations of the night watch that Larry Daley goes through as he loses the instructions the retiring team of security guards gave him almost immediately are pretty funny.  However, it seems common sense desserts him as the place comes alive.While much of the comedy is physical and slapstick, it is also just the thing to entertain young kids!!  They love the ideas of the ""little"" men attacking the full size human and so forth.Best watched with young kids.  Only mildly amusing for adults alone.",N/A
1091908,"After seeing this show in Houston, and being hugely impressed I decided to buy this DVD,  dismissing peoples claims that Dio sounded spectacular - they said that about him on ""Holy Diver Live"" and I only found his vocals so so on that concert- (age considered he sounded great, just not as good as so many had claimed)As this concert begins Dio's vocals are only slightly off, but as the show progresses he sounds fantastic! The songs used are perfect with the exception of the new songs (which I may grow to enjoy over time).If you like Black Sabbath with Ozzy you may want to avoid this one- Zero of the Ozzy era songs are performed which is fine with me,  I never thought Dio did them much justice, even though I prefer his time with the band over Ozzy's.But this concert is definitely not just a showcase for Dio,  the rest of the band preforms like the well oiled seasoned professionals they are.  Tony is one of my favorite guitarists and he really shines here.Inclusion of ""Lonely is the World"" was worth the price of admission to me, one of my favorite songs rarely played.Also with this show they corrected one of my complaints about Live Evil where they combined Heaven and Hell and Sign of the Southern cross"".  Here they are both played in their entirety,  and Dio does not mention once about how the show is being filmed.If you like the Dio era Black Sabbath GET THIS DVD you will not be disappointed!

137097,"Brando's ambivalence about this project - He reportedly wanted to do a film about Caryl Chessman the recently executed,convicted killer who had been 'rehabilitated' instead - is apparent throughout. He strove to make this a chronicle of man's inhumanity to man and wanted to explore what happened on Pitcairn Island in more detail than previous versions in light of the tragedy which unfolded there. The ending that was finally filmed a year after everything else - notice what appears to be a hair-piece on his head - didn't really satisfy anybody. All the while,his excentric playing seemed to Pauline Kael among others to be distracting - a stunt. Brando the erstwhile uncouth slob is playing a Restoration fop with an all British supporting cast.He could have made 'Lawrence of Arabia' instead, but didn't want to spend two years on a camel in the desert.  How many guys would when they can spend time in Tahiti? What really sticks in my mind about this film is Brando's performance, especially the accent. In fact, it's my favourite English accent in any film! While watching 'Master and Commander' I couldn't help but wonder how funny it would be if Russell Crowe had to play opposite an even bigger American star who insisted on employing an accent like Brando's.

1027488,"No doubt, this whole DVD is all about Gruberova. I have no problem to give five stars to this DVD just based on her performance. Then I think I should deduct some points for whatever else that I don't like.There are so many elements in a production of an opera: the set; the lighting; the costume; the concept of the stage director; the orchestra/chorus/conductor; and ultimately, the singers (after all, their voice is what we all came to hear). The quality of a DVD also comes into play. Fortunately, this disc was made using the latest technology, not a re-mastered piece; the quality of the disc is the best I have ever seen.By now I already get used to those minimal settings on the opera stage. This one does not upset me. But, can they put just a little bit more stuff on the stage? For one thing, I do agree with Archie that using an underground cave as a hideout for Norma and her children is a clever way in the setting. However, it was not obvious and I did not click the first time when she walked up to the stage from down there.The costume, which I think has quite a bit to do with the stage director's concept, it agitated me a little at first. I thought I was seeing the Romans in today's army uniform but the Gauls wore ancient clothes. What a match? As stage directors often transform the period of the plot to suit today's situation, then I thought it might be the Gauls were being portrayed as Muslims (in today's clothing, sort of). The idea is being that Christians (Romans) and Muslims don't mix (they are enemies in the plot). Remember the Crusaders? I might guess it wrong. But I would let it go this way for now. It should be clarified that in no way I am trying to inject any political correctness (or incorrectness) here. Just tried to figure out what was going on on-stage. Still, the army uniforms and the machine guns are bothersome.Now, the singers: Read through all the existing reviews, I did not find anything else but just nice words that please both Gruberova and Ganassi. I don't think I can (or need to) add anything more to it other than cheer along with them, with enthusiasm. In addition to the fine work of this two singers, the conductor and his orchestra have done an excellent job; their performance were totally first rate. Very seldom one could experience such fabulous sound from the pit. A thumb way up is in order. My big problem is with the tenor. I really cannot stand the way he shouted all the way in the first act. Though he finally came around in the second act. It is quite common that singers need time to warm up. Why took the entire first act to do that? The problem is not just the screaming. Though not a good thing, many tenors do that quite often. In this case he let all the air out from his lung (sounded like chest voice, or something else, not exactly know what it was). Using chest voice constantly is really bad. Then, he swung his body a lot, even more so when he scream. Too much acting!",Bellini - Norma
983095,"It all sounds terribly thrilling at first: a marriage between two homosexuals of opposite sexes, enjoying married life while engaging in same-sex affairs. It's almost too good to be true, which is exactly what is shown in this engrossing dramatization. The acting is flawless, but the characters seem hardly attractive. Vita Sackville-West plays a terribly selfish, destructive person who talks a good game of devotion to husband and children, but loses herself so much in her passing lusts that she not only can't see why she should spend Christmas with her family, but can't see why the British should defeat Hitler. She's giddy with her new-found sexual liberation but becomes a stranger to reason and, finally, almost wholly unsympathetic. Her horsey bad looks and fabulous wealth evidently made her irresistible to some, but as acted this is a woman who verges on the detestable. Husband Harold is oddly weak and ordinary. Vita's girlfriend seems merely vulgar.",Portrait of a Marriage

The plot twists in this first season sometimes come across as a bit too forced and coincidental, an aspect that was greatly improved upon in the second season, but the most important question is: Are the laughs there?  They certainly are.  The criticism of some reviewers that a little Larry David goes a long way is well taken--your enjoyment of this series will depend on how you feel about him.  I think he's funny.  The episodes guest-starring Richard Lewis are doubly funny.  They should make greater use of him as a foil for Larry.

971249,"Liza and Streisand can do no wrong..... BUT, in Liza's commentary she doesn't say much as far as her feelings, thoughts, what she was going through at the time and mostly sits mute watching WITH us which I was VERY disappointed about..... no, actually shocked.  NO introspective at all.  {I'm a born & bred Manhattanite, lots of friends in the business, in addition to my own demanding tastes, and my standards are very high, but THIS was not even because of that.  This reached NO standards at all.  Through the entire commentary you'll be waiting for her to **SAY SOMETHING**]......As if that isn't bad enough.  I wonder if SHE had control of the sound level of the production in the commentary, and was able to turn it up when not speaking and down when she was, because the show is INAUDIBLE even when she WASN'T saying anything [which was 95% of the time] so we didn't even have her performance to LISTEN to through the practically non-existent commentary except only a COUPLE of times when she or someone ''remembered'' to turn up the volume of the show.  How UNPROFESSIONAL and I don't know HOW it could be released in that condition.... didn't anyone NOTICE??  Her voice level is loud enough to be heard OVER an audible level of the production which she and WE are watching so someone should have TOLD her to leave her singing at a higher volume level  All she mostly contributes is a lot of ''HUP's'' and her infamous little giggles.  [Perhaps a little drinky-poo during this taping?  Gee, I talk MORE when having a few drinks, not less or none at all!].  The rest of the extra features were wonderful.....Despite all this, of course the original was one of history's greatest moment's in time, and one of the GREATEST tributes and examples of the GENIUS of ''Fosse'' and also of Kander and Ebb, my favorite trio of all time, and I ain't no KID and have been around a LONG time and have seen 'em' all!  Sadly these and other giant's haven't been and won't be replaced any time soon.......When originally broadcast on TV I had the Tape of it [I think?  Was that ever available on VHS, or I taped it MYSELF long ago] and also the audio cassette and couldn't get enough, and now am thrilled at the CD but what is so unique about that is SUPPOSED to be her contribution TO it, in her own words....... so don't depend on THAT.  But it is something to have in your collection, nevertheless, for the mere show.......On it you will hear that she had the only copy of this and on a whim, offered to have it re-released, [paraphrasing] she ''claims'' but who ever knows if those stories are true lol but which I found interesting on the """"Toronto Film Festival Premiere"""" onstage afterwards, one of the other special features.  When Liza get's STARTED talking she can't stop, which is great..... but on the Commentary she never got started.If you've never seen this, her dancing is is a vision to behold, and better than I even remembered.  I saw it on PBS recently as promotion during one of their station telethons to promote the DVD, but it wasn't in it's entirety, so this is a MUST have.  Also bought it with Streisand's ""The Television Specials"" which is a 5 Disc Boxed set [whew!], but haven't had time to go through that yet, and also have those on VHS tape, caught here and there individually throughout the decades, and can only HOPE the commentary is respectful to our / the public's expectations, which Liza's was NOT.  Wish I could tell her personally.  With a life like HER'S and her Mother's AND Father's in addition to her OWN career....... she couldn't find anything to SAY for the length of Liza with a Z?  Unacceptable......Now you'll think it's MORE than you expected, because of what I'm saying...... but if seeing it cold like I did, without reading this, believe me....... it's quite a shock.  She just ''wasn't with the program''. Perhaps she just thought it was a good opportunity to do her nails, but not on MY dime, please.  ""HUP"".... schmup.  Hey, Liza..... if you read this, [seeming like a person who cares how your public is actually receiving your work, and what better place to go than Amazon for that, and the ONLY place, actually ]..... give me a hollar, at Ceeahra at yahoo, [or anyone ELSE who agrees or disagrees, and wants to 'yada yada' about it].....

1055071,"The following below are the offical match results as seen from WrestleMania 23 on April 1st, 2007.Ok, first of all I was a bit disappointed with some things before WrestleMania even took place on Sunday April 1st. The fact that Hulk Hogan should have been in that match with Great Khali(to duplicate the WrestleMania III moment), The ECW world title should have been defended. The contestants in the Money in the Bank should have been more carefully picked. And the Cruiserweight title which was held by Gregory Helms for over a year at the time was suddenly stripped of his waist 1 month before Wrestlemania, and no tag team gold was included on the card either.The 3rd Annual Money in the Bank Ladder MatchWinner: Mr. KennedyRaiting: 7.5/10I was upset to see Kennedy win, but it could be worse. I think that Randy Orton should have won because he really needs a decent push to work with, considering he won the title 3 years ago and he cannot even compete in a WWE Championship match anymore. Finlay was a mistake to put in this match so was Booker T., both of them should have been in a 3 way match with Chris Benoit competing for the U.S. Championship in what would be the best  United States title match ever. I think that Hardocre Holly, and MVP should have taken their places. The match was overall good, im not sure if it surpassed last years MITBM but it could have been better this year, considering talent like Edge and Jeff Hardy were out the first 5 minutes going in the match.The Great Khali Vs. KaneWinner: Great KhaliRaiting: 3.5/10Somebody please explain to me why this match even took place. There was not even a stipulation like a body slam match or a last man standing match...Just a ridiculous singles match and a waste of talent. Probably better than last years Booker and Boogeyman match I would say.The United States ChampionshipChris Benoit Vs. MVPWinner: Chris BenoitRaiting: 5.5/10This match should have never taken place either. Chris Benoit should have wrestled in a triple threat against Finlay and Booker T,and I guarentee you that it would have been an amazing match, Benoit competed with these men in some of the best matches ever seen back in WCW. Instead they put MVP who I think should have been in the Money in the Bank ladder match instead. The match started off pretty good, but it became an uninteresting match, some great counters though.The World Heavyweight TitleBatista Vs. The UndertakerWinner: The UndertakerRaiting: 8.5/10This was a great match, Batista looked more aggressive than usual, kind of rekindled the spirit of the heel Batista we used to watch back when he was in Evolution in 2004. Undertaker showed great athlethism in the match. Both men kicking out of each other's finishing moves. Undertaker still rules the WrestleMania ring after being undefeated 15-0, finally the dead man rises once again!!ECW Originals Vs. The New BreedWinners: The ECW OriginalsRaiting: 6/10Is it just me or were the fans screwed when they watched this match. Lets see WWE resurrected the ECW name just to have a 8-man tag match at the grandest stage of all!? there was a big amount of disappointment in this match, there was no stipulation, no hardcore rules? no eliminations? What happened!?! Decent to watch but its to upsetting to watch great talent go to waste. Paul Heyman had to be happy after watching his pride possesion turn into a teletubby warfare.The Battle of the BillionairesUmaga w/ Mr. McMahon Vs. Bobby Lashley w/ Donald TrumpHair Vs. Hair Match with special referee Stone Cold Steve AustinWinner(s): Bobby Lashley with Donald TrumpRaiting: 8/10This match I have to say was very entertaining. It was cool to see Stone Cold return to WrestleMania. And Umaga and Lashley put on a great match. There were certain parts of the match that I like such as Stone Cold stunning Umaga and Lashley spearing him. I also like the part when Shane came in and did his ""coast to coast"" move on the top rope. In the end McMahon had his head shaved but it was a bit too dramatic if you ask me. Mr.McMahon should go see TMNT because he's got a big role in it as Splinter. Stone Cold stunned Trump which was also cool. In the end it was a fun match to watch.Womens Championship Lumberjill MatchWinner: MelinaRaiting: 4.5/10Another disappointing match, I actually thought this would be a good match but it was 2 minutes of un-entertaining wrestling. Melina can actually wrestle a little. Its Ashley who is un-trained and all she did was mostly kicks and punches. I did believe that Mickie James and Victoria would go against Melina in a triple Threat for the title but i was wrong again. To be honest it was more fun watching the divas than the actual match.WWE Championship MatchJohn Cena Vs. Shawn MichaelsWinner: John CenaRaiting: 10/10Alot of people don't realize some of the best matches in the history of professional wrestling. If you look back at WrestleManias in the past there are some matches that are just amazing to watch and get you caught up in the passion of the sport, the athlethism, and charisma. This was one of them.From start to finish this match was a knockout! even more entertaining than last year's WWE championship match. Watching this match gave me goosebumps because it had some nostalgic feeling that I cannot even explain. There was plenty of reversals, plenty of suspensful moments in the match where people were literally on their feet watching at home. HBK put up a valiant effort during the match but tapped out just as his friend Triple H did at last year's WrestleMania 22. Shawn Michaels actually gave a performance we have longed to see since WrestleMania 12. The best match of 2007 thus far.Thank you for checking out my review for WrestleMania 23!",N/A
509184,"Absolutely brilliant performance by Atkinson; this is a fantastic DVD. As noted by other reviewers, it has a plethora of skits, including both US and UK sets. I was ecstatic to finally get the Devil sketch on DVD, having not seen it in years. (Had the VHS but lost it to Katrina.)Now, a big knock against A&E;, enough to give the release itself zero stars (I wish Amazon allowed for multiple ratings, so we could rate the performance separate from its media presentation). A&E; apparently hates the hearing impaired. For years they have released countless shows on disc without any form of closed captioning or subtitles. What's mind boggling about that is, in many cases, the captioning is available to them, but they opt not to use it, instead ""cleaning"" the footage of such encoding. (In fact, A&E; television programs are almost always captioned.) I can't fathom why, but it does result in lost sales.I'm not deaf, but I do have a hearing problem. I overcome it with hearing aids and a good speaker system on my video, but I rarely buy A&E; releases; I either rent them or wait for their appearance on TV. But I've bypassed buying scores of A&E; releases -- everything from the entire release sets of Poirot to Jeeves & Wooster to Space: 1999 -- for lack of any form of captioning and/or subtitles.FWIW, I have contacted A&E; about it; the polite response was that the company did not feel their normal viewership/customer base needed captioning or subtitles to justify the additional cost.Sorry for the rant. 5 stars to Mr. Atkinson and a superb performance; 0 to A&E; for another shaft to the hearing impaired.",N/A
646392,"Brian de Palma has never been the most gifted of filmmaker's but he's crafted some pretty good stuff, namely Carrie, Dressed to Kill and The Untouchables, but what we have here is a dismal excuse for a movie that considering the incredible source material, falls not only flat on its face but manages to go subterranean.  The Black Dahlia (a.k.a Elizabeth Short) murder is one of the most iconic and fantastic of unsolved murder mysteries of the 20th century and one deeply rooted in the allure and myth of old Hollywood.  This kind of fodder in the right hands could have yielded extraordinary results, but de Palma seems to have no idea not only how handle the material but how to induce the slightest bit of interest in anyone associated with it.  Every single actor seemed not only bored but downright annoyed, with Hilary Swank (a consistently gifted actress) hamming it up in the femme fatale role of socialite, Madeleine Linscott.  The plot is contrived beyond salvation; ideas and themes thrown in at break-neck speed but in the end not amounting to anything.  There's plenty of conjecture but little proof or finality, so, in the end, who cares? Yes, the film is visually appealing and attention to detail is in full evidence, but that's about it.  Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart and Scarlett Johansson just lie as still as swamp water and even the score by the usually reliable Mark Isham fails to create a sense of time and place.  Believe it or not, the best performance was given Mia Kirshner in the role of Betty Short, who, incidentally, has about a total 10 minutes of screen time and all through screen test films.  With minimal time, she manages to not only humanize a very sensational story but to convey the tragedy that struck this young woman 60 some odd years ago.  Those expecting anything similar to L.A. Confidential or any other film noir masterwork (I did, based on the fact that both novels were written by James Ellroy...big mistake) will be disappointed beyond words.  This is a very pathetic effort, indeed.  What made it doubly annoying was just how much I was looking forward to seeing it.",The Black Dahlia
717989,"to each his own opinion i guess, but this movie couldn't have been any better than what it was. the cast, the story, the dragons. i don't think i need to say more, but i will. i loved it. it had a good point, that suspense of man against creature, and that bit of action that we all enjoy. it's a time of struggle, and with only a handful of people left, with only their will to survive, and a world full of hungry dragons who will win. a constant battle between man and beast. the fact that this is fantasy and the beauty of the dragons is what makes this movie great. matthew mcconaughey did his thing in this one. that shaved head, that strength, and that psychotic attitude of his fit him like a glove. he knew what he was doing and he was fighting these creatures with a fury seen only in his eyes. excellent role play by this man. let's not forget christian bale, another very talented actor in my book. here he saw the first, and lives with that every day, so he tries his best to be the leader and the only hope these people have. he stays strong and he fights for the survival of mankind. give this man a role and he delivers way better than the average actor. lots of stars for this one, it did it for me.",N/A

1386298,"Directors Quentin Tarrentino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill) and Robert Rodriguez (Sin City) seem to be a dream team-p in the movie world. They are great friends in real life, and excel in the same style of moviemaking, long, violent tales of characters either on the edge of insanity, trying to seek redemption or simply looking for a good time. Seeing the two collaborate was a dream for their fans, and we got a taste of what it would be like in Rodriguez's 2005 comic book masterpiece Sin City, which featured a sequence directed by Tarrentino.Now tow years later, a full-on collaboration between the two has come into fruition. Grindhouse is a tribute to an old form cinema that was famous back in the 1970s'. ""Grindhouse Cinema"" as it was called was when two films were combined into one and played straight through, with a few trailers for other movies shown in between. Tarrentino an Rodriguez revive this art form to sizzling perfection with a one-two punch of two brilliantly conceived, viciously entertaining thrill rides.The first is Rodriguez's sci-fi / horror zombie vehicle, Planet Terror. The film starts off by introducing us to its main character and heroine, Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan, of Charmed fame), a troubled go-go dancer tying to find a more reasonable calling in life. Meanwhile, a biochemist named Abby (Naveen Andrews, aka Sayid from Lost), has blown a trade with the corrupt Lt. Muldoon (an uncredited Bruce Willis), and has released a gas into the small backwoods town the film takes place in, turning its citizens into homicidal, brain munching zombies. Unbeknownst to the terror about to unfold, Cherry unwinds at J.T.'s Steak Pit, where she meets her former flame Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), thus rekindling unwanted feelings.Meanwhile, the dysfunctional couple of Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) and his nurse wife Dakota (Marley Shelton, who played Wendy Peffercorn, the hot lifeguard in The Sandlot) have had their lovely interrupted by an emergency at the hospital involving various town patrons being infected by a mysterious chemicals eating at their flesh and turning them into the living dead. When these ghoulish maniacs attack Cherry and tear off her leg (leading to several amputee jokes before the world famous machine gun leg is inserted), Wray teams up with the local sheriff (Michael Beihn) and his team to put an end to the mayhem these ghouls have caused.Essentially, you can guess your way through the rest of the film, though there are definitely a few interesting plot twists along the way.After some fake previews comes Tarrentino's Death Proof. This story revolves around Stuntman Mike (the legendary Kurt Russell, aka Snake Pilssken), a murderous stunt driver who gets his kick out of massacring young ladies with his ""death proof car"". Mike's way involves wooing"" a bevy of beauties, stalking them around town as they travel, then finally crashing into him, killing his victims while he remains unscathed. 5 unlucky ladies (including McGowan in a role different from Cherry Darling) fall prey to him after a wild night on the town.His blood lust at an all time high, Stuntman Mike sets his sights on four traveling teenage girls: Lee (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Abernathy (he always wonderful Rosario Dawson), Kim (Rent's Tracie Thoms) and Zoe (Zoe Bell, Uma Thurman's stunt double in both Kill Bill movies). The four girls are on a quest for a specific model of car, which they buy from a farmer (Lee stays behind), and perform the most dangerous car stunt known to man. Unbeknownst to them, Stuntman Mike is on their tail, and he isn't looking to be their friend. This leads to a spectacular climax in which Zoe Bell steals the show. I won't divulge the details, except that if you're blood is not pumping, your heart isn't racing and you're not on the edge of the seat during the last 20 minuets of the film, you probably died some time during the showing of the film, as you are witnessing one of the most exciting things you will ever see on film.Overall, Grindhouse is 191 minutes (over three hours) of pure adrenaline provided by two top notch action thrill rides helmed by two of the best directors working today. As I said earlier, we get fake trailers throughout the film, directed by guest directors. Among others, Eli Roth of Hostel fame provides the terrifyingly funny horror spoof Thanksgiving, Rob Zombie (who I'm normally repulsed by) scores the highlight with Werewolf Women Of The S.S, a WWII - era Germany parody featuring Nicolas Cage's best work since Face / Off, and Rodriguez cohort Danny Trejo stars in the action thriller Machete (which will be a real film from what I read).Overall, Grindhouse is over three hours of nonstop excitement, and the most fun you will have at the movies all year.",N/A

However, I found the instructor to be incredibly annoying, enough so that I only did the workout twice.  He's condescending and smug.  He was patronizing to the woman who was doing most of the actual exercises while he stood there and lectured.  His counting method is stupid--he'll be counting down, then he'll repeat a number over and over (12, 11, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8).  I find that incredibly insulting and demotivating.

1102588,"If you check history, you will find that John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" did not come out the gate a critics' darling or a financial success; according to late producer/cowriter Debra Hill, the initial reactions ""were brutal."" Ironic, then, how it has since developed a revered following (though I'm honestly not a big fan) that most people today think was always the case.I bring this up because Rob Zombie's remake--in addition to being the shot in the arm the franchise desperately needs--will likely have the same fate; years down the road, I think it will be valued on the same level as the ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"" remakes. While Zombie's film is jagged in spots, with narrative jumps (where did Loomis get the cop car? how does Michael get to Haddonfield from the middle-of-nowhere truck stop?) and plain-view continuity errors (some of which were probably inspired by the ill-advised Weinstein Bros. reshoots), the filmmaker has brought a pathos to this human monster that is more rich and fulfilling than any of the films prior (yes, I'm including the original).What seems to offend ""Halloween"" purists most is the mere principle of Zombie's undertaking--how DARE he remake a CLASSIC--instead of looking at the film in the broader scope of things: would you rather see Michael Myers going head-to-head with Busta Rhymes? How about a continuation of that desperate Celtic mumbo-jumbo? Zombie's position was inarguably unglamorous, no doubt realizing as many people would embrace his film as decry it. For my tastes, he has brought an angle that fuses popular serial killer lore with the sense of tragedy that marked the classic Universal Monsters--it's a tricky feat, but by introducing us to pint-size Michael (Daeg Faerch) and spending time with him, his adult counterpart--while a ruthless machine of brutality--possesses the faint traces of humanity that marked Frankenstein's Monster, or the Wolf Man. In many ways, his ultimate downfall is as tragic as the atrocities he commits. And THAT is what ultimately transcends all in ""Halloween""--putting a face and motive to what was once a mere in-the-shadows specter of ""evil.""The first half of the film provides a satisfying, creatively-filmed backstory (I'm anxiously awaiting the additional scenes being restored for the upcoming DVD), wherein we get an overview of young Michael, his fatal deeds, and his time in Smith's Grove, under the watch of Dr. Sam Loomis (a well-cast Malcolm McDowell). Only in the second half does ""Halloween"" kick into full-blown remake mode, with gritty renderings of scenes from Carpenter's film; despite this, Zombie manages to put his own spin on traditional scares, adding a visceral edge and urgency to death. I actually appreciated the truncated characterizations of Laurie (the immensely likable Scout Taylor-Compton), Lynda (Kristina Klebe), and Annie (""Halloween 4/5"" vet Danielle Harris), since their interactions in the original are what ultimately dulled it down for me; here, Zombie gives us a quick introduction (just enough time to get a feel for the characters) before getting down to business. And while the ""sex=death"" equation here is hardly inspired, it certainly beats the torture-device-laden-labyrinth of another ""Saw"" film.Zombie treats the material with a great deal of reverence and respect, and utilizes a reality-focused style to establish a proper tone (imagine the dustbowl squalor of ""The Devil's Rejects"" brought to suburbia); the death scenes are filmed with unflinching brutality, yet seldom feel exaggerated. Time will tell, but to me, ""Halloween"" is a more than worthy addition to the pantheon of great remakes (and horror films in general).",Halloween

1083232,"This is a pretty good film but it realy does take its time to get going.  Have to say that for about 2/3 of the film you are realy struggling to keep your attention especially due to the plot realy not helping much.Film starts with the brutal murder of a friend of Halle Berry, prime suspect is Bruce Willis who runs a large company.  Berry decides to investigate by posing as a temp in his company and on an internet chat/date service which Willis uses to pick up women for his numerous affairs.The film does kind of drag on but their is a nice little twist at the end, you are thrown a couple of hints to this throughout the film but it is only at the end when they all come together.  Sort of reminds me a littel of Gothica Berrys other film (more in the sense of there being a traumatic event in the past that someone in the film has to come to terms with)One big problem with the film is that it does at times try to be clever what with all the internet chat, breaking through firewalls etc the problem with all this is it has been done so many times before.Though Willis is on the cover of this film he realy takes a bit of a background role it is Berry who is the main actress in this.  Think the director of this film has made a point of picking out the lowest cut dresses he could find for Berry to fit into.Overall a good film worth watching.",N/A
1129780,"Volume 1 of the gangster series focused on Warner's premiere gangster movie properties. Volume 2 focused on how Warner's handled the gangster picture in the era of the code. Volume 3, although it does consist of the second tier of Warner's gangster films, still has first-rate films and actually a better look at the pre-code era than volume 1 did. In that first package only two of the films were pre-code. This set has four very good examples of pre-code films of the gangster genre.1933's ""Picture Snatcher"" is one I've waited to come out on DVD for some time. It's about a gangster (James Cagney) who decides to go straight and become a photographer for a scandal sheet. In the end he gets the girl and a photo of an execution to boot. The film is fast paced and full of the energy that only Cagney could lend to such a role.1931's ""Smart Money"" is the only time Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney were paired in a film. Robinson is definitely in the lead here, though. Although it's impossible to really describe Cagney as ""subdued"" in anything he ever did, he is toned down a bit. Robinson is a barber who gets 10K together to gamble in one of the syndicate's big games. This turns out the way you'd expect when a small time guy goes up against the mob and expects them to play on the level. Robinson's character vows revenge as a result of this double-cross. Not the best pre-code, but a good example of what Robinson could do.1933's ""Mayor of Hell"" is one of Warner's depression-era message films. They made many of these in the precode era. Here James Cagney is Patsy Gargan, a reformed gangster who is sent to a boy's reform school as a political favor. The current warden is corrupt and merciless. He fears Gargan will discover and expose how he's been using his position for personal gain, and thus must cook up some way of toppling Gargan before he discovers the truth of the situation.1933's ""Lady Killer"" reteams James Cagney with Mae Clarke. Cagney plays Dan Quigley, a movie usher who gets fired and then falls in with a gang of hoodlums to make ends meet. However, when a robbery at a mansion goes wrong Quigley leaves town and heads for California. There he does well in the movies until his old gang hears about his success and his past deeds come back to haunt him. Here poor Mae Clarke gets slapped around again, just as she had been in ""Public Enemy"". No wonder that she looks so worriedly at that grapefruit in the California travel brochure. For those of you who have seen ""Public Enemy"" you know what I mean.Now on to the code-era films...1937's ""Black Legion"" tells a story of a man's involvement with what amounts to the Klan without coming out and calling it that. Humphrey Bogart stars as Frank Taylor, a working man who loses a bid to become foreman when a foreign-born man gets the job instead. The Legion is right up Taylor's alley, reinforcing his belief that his woes are all the fault of the foreign-born. He gradually gets more immune to the violence as he gets in deeper and deeper with the Black Legion.1940's ""Brother Orchid"" is the lightest of the films in the bunch. Here Edward G. Robinson plays Johnny Sarto, a rival to gangster Jack Buck, played by Humphrey Bogart. Buck convinces Sarto's girl (Ann Sothern) to lure Sarto to a nightspot, and there Buck's gang ambushes him and leaves him for dead. He is nursed back to health by a group of monks. After he recovers he finds he likes the life the monks lead, but when he learns his girl is about to marry someone else he has to choose between two different lifestyles. This film has some good comic turns by Robinson.I won't mention the extra features since another reviewer has already pointed them out.",Warner Gangsters Collection - Vol. 3: (Smart Money / Picture Snatcher / The Mayor of Hell / Lady Killer / Black Legion / Brother Orchid)
661370,"There is also a good reason for beautiful and accomplished ballerina Suzanne Farrell's muse status.  For the first time (as is documented in this film), Suzanne Farrell came out of her self-imposed silence as far as her relationship with the legendary choreographer, the late George Balanchine (or ""Mr. B,"" as Farrell knew him), as well as other aspects of her personal life, from her formative years at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, Balanchine's School of American Ballet up through her years at the New York City Ballet, as a member of the corps de ballet and then, later, as a principal dancer.  Farrell was nothing short of a true inspiration for George Balanchine, and there were a couple of significant relationships in Suzanne's life that created a strain between her and Mr. B.  Those connections include that with her mother and then with fellow dancer, Paul Mejia, who eventually became her husband.  Though, aspects of her personal life are delved into, we also see wonderful footage from some of the most beautiful roles of her career.  Farrell has such poise and grace, like no other dancer I have seen.  The woman moves like the most graceful angel, fallen to earth.  I can see why Mr. Balanchine was so drawn to her, as a dancer, and enjoyed dancing with her so much (some feel a little too much, even).  I would definitely reccomend this film because it features great anecdotal footage with numerous dancers who worked with Suzanne Farrell and knew her well, professionally, as well as personally, and also really gives us a better sense of a true American Master in the dance world.",N/A

Like Spiderman, Superman, Batman, and others, the character of Richie Rich is based on a comic book superhero.  Richie Rich offers us a different type of superhero in that his super power consists of the ridiculous amount of $$$$$ he has.  Richie and his family can do amazing things with their superpower. They can build their own Mount Richmore, build a McDonald's in their basement, have their own rollercoaster, jet all over the world and more. Just as most kids have dreamed of being able to fly like Superman and swing from webs like Spidey, kids and adults alike have dreamt of what it would be like to have Bill Gates' billions.  And like Superman, Batman, Spidey, etc., the Rich family uses their superpower to help others.Another similarity between Richie and other comic book heroes is that just as Superman, Spidey and Batman's superpowers keep them from getting and/or keeping a girl - Richie's superpower keeps him from getting and keeping friends.  This movie is about how all that changes.  Though Richie's $$$$$ plays an initial role in introducing him to potential friends, it's not what enables him to keep them - Richie is genuinely a nice kid.Sure its silly and ridiculous but guess what - its supposed to be.  For me the less than stellar acting and profuse overacting on the part of some of the actors just adds to the overall ridiculousness.

837816,"I was really blown away by ANDY GOLDSWORTHY'S RIVER & TIDES, the first time I saw it on the big screen in the movie theater in 2003.  In all honesty, the big screen is the best way to fully experience the magic of Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy's remarkable natural works of living and moving art.  Since Goldsworthy's sculptures are made from transitory material he finds in nature (discs of melting ice that he so elegantly places near and around rootbound trees, cones made out of bits of pebble, just to name a few examples), none of his pieces last forever.  But, really, what does in this world?  Human beings spend so much time feeling to be master in command over nature, one another, material and living objects, and RIVERS & TIDES truly brings the message of the temporary state of nature and humankind in the world.  It ebbs and flows, and Goldsworthy's unassuming but dutiful continuity as a true natural artist, working with the medium of mother nature, to design intricate visual sculpture and installations out of the elements we take for granted all too often.  This is an especially timely film in this day and age, where we are questioning what is to be done to work toward sustainability and conservation in the world.

991104,"Looking back through the corridors of cinema through the passages of time, one could almost say that films released in the early days were more creative, more intuitive, and more aggressive than those raiding our multiplexes today.  Films made in the 1940 especially stand out as those that seem to delve into the human psyche more than the capers of ""Transformers"" or ""Bee Movie"" in today's standard.  There are elements that continue to excite and bewilder this critic for films made in the 1940s compared to those today.  ""His Girl Friday"", ""Blithe Spirit"", and even ""Brief Encounter"" can easily be placed into my DVD player well before anything made during the current year ... why is that?  For me it is creativity and example, modern day Hollywood seems to be in a recycling slump with only a handful of ""must-see"" films being released every year.  It feels as if the creative has died and been replaced with the commercial.  If product placement isn't in every contract, a film will die before it is born.  Recently, I had the opportunity to see another innovative chapter in the 1948 film release vault entitled ""The Amazing Mr. X"", while released pathetically by a under budget DVD company, the film itself carries with it a strong blend of creativity, suspense, and intrigue followed up by an ending that will shock the very cockles of your heart.  While it wasn't a glowing example of perfection, it did demonstrate an early, more innovative side of Hollywood that wasn't afraid of exploring the unknown.With a strong cast and a devilish plot, ""The Amazing Mr. X"" begins strong, looses steam near the middle, but oddly regains its footing by the final act.  There are honest moments of suspense and giddiness as you see how Turhan Bey uses his ""magic"" to educate those who are - let' say - weak of mind, but full of possibilities.  Mr. Bey is fantastic in the lead role, giving up nothing of his character, going outside of his pre-designated box to portray this mesmerizing con-artist.  Coupled with his raven, he is menacing, sinister, and provocative all at once.  He is the core of this film, and director Bernard Vorhaus did a great job of casting him and giving him the space to create the character.  Bey's eyes let us see into his world, and they never let us go.  Lynn Beri works well against Bey's performance, but at times it seems shallow and shuttered.  This deepens whenever her pseudo-boyfriend, Richard Carlson, happens to be around.  He is another character that seemed to be created simply as a plot devise, and added nothing to the overall scheme of the film.  As you watch these characters work together, it is obvious that Bey is the only one enjoying what he is doing, going beyond the script and giving us a strong performance.  The rest seemed like cardboard, reading their lines with little to no development as the film progresses.  I couldn't shake Bey's performance, or his home for that matter.  Did anyone else see the technology that he used - well beyond the 1940s, but added a whole new level of evil to his character.  ""The Amazing Mr. X"" was not a character driven film, but instead a plot driven caper with many levels.  It worked because of Mr. Bey, but alas, the other characters could have been revamped.  Even if you ignore the characters, the style of this film really sets it apart from current cinema.John Alton took this film over the top.  His use of the camera was striking in this early film.  There are scenes that just stand out as staples of other horror/mystery films of today.  The scene that grabs me is when Bey conjures the spirits in his house.  The special effects used (of the music, the piano, the face, and so forth) were genuinely spooky.  There were two distinct elements to this film; one was the darkened room of Bey in which he was able to show people what they wanted to see, and the lighted truth of Beri's huge mansion.  It was when the two began to blend together that the tension spiked in the film.  Decent characters, amazing cinematography, good script - so where did this film go wrong?  Like others of this era, there was so much excitement going into the film that elements seemed to be left out.  Director Vorhaus (of who should be praised for this film) seemed to enjoy the long motionless, emotionless, and corny long shots of our characters doing absolutely nothing.  This occurred more through the center of the film where interest was fading due to a lack of mobility.  ""The Amazing Mr. X"" had such a strong opening, the beach scene was startling, that when we moved to the center, dialogue driven part, there was nothing for the audience to grab onto.  We had the early character development; this middle part just seemed forced.  Then, we were dished a huge surprise (honestly, one that I didn't see coming) that revitalized the film and gave us a twisting ending.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, but the journey to that part was too costly.Bey's sidekick was forgotten.  Beri's sister became annoying. These are just a few small steps that could have been tightened to ensure that this film wouldn't fall through the cracks and perhaps catapult itself into ""cult"" status.  This was an early independent feature, and while budgeting is always needed, this film could have strengthened a couple of scenes so that the audience wouldn't loose its grip midstream.  Overall, I liked this film, but it isn't one that I could watch on a repetitive basis.  I thought the creativity was outstanding, this is one of those films that shocked me once, twice, even three times and I wasn't even ready for it.  The direction could have been tighter, but at times I forgot about it due to the strong camera work by Alton.  ""The Amazing Mr. X"" is a film made well before its time, and if released again today, I think there are some that would attach themselves to it because of what it has to offer.  This is not a film for everyone, but for those willing to explore possibilities and undiscovered avenues.  This film had a strong main character coupled with some innovative special effects for the time.  On a side note, I could watch a whole movie about the magician cop - it was a breathe of fresh air during this dark caper.  Watch it once for the experience, I think it was worth the rental.Grade: ***  out of *****",N/A

He may be the greatest screenwriter of all time.  He has over a hundred credits and some of them are among the best movies ever made.  Here's a brief list from those that I have seen: The Ogre (1996), Valmont (1989), The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), Diary of a Chambermaid (1964).There's some symbolism in Cet obscur objet du desir.  Sometimes Mathieu (Fernando Rey) carries around an old gunny sack.  We find out what's in it in the final scene.  It represents Conchita's virginity.  The terrorists in the background seem rather contemporary although this movie is from 1977.  Mathieu is rich and therefore represents the established European society.  Conchita and her friends represent the underclass.  Both Mathieu and Conchita are really character types.  He is the masher, the rake who is always working on a new conquest, although he is somewhat naive.  She is the tease who uses her wiles to get what she can from him.  Bunuel plays this ancient theme as a burlesque, exaggerating her coyness and his foolishness.  The ending may suggest that in some way he has won, or more likely that they are still at a standoff, even while the terrorists escalate the bombings.The question of why there are two actresses playing Conchita has more to do with Maria Schneider, who originally was cast in the role, but left because of the nudity or because Conchita's character was too contrary, than it has to do with any plot or symbolic necessity.  On the other hand, since she is that ""obscure object of desire"" (which really should be that ""unobtainable object of desire""), and because Bunuel wanted to emphasize that Mathieu's desire for her had nothing to do with her personally, he used two actresses and made it clear that Mathieu didn't notice the difference!

469287,"I knew the ad campaign was hype.  I knew it was just a bunch of actors.  However, I went to the theater to be scared.  I mean, Rolling Stone had said, ""Scary As Hell!!""  And, it wasn't alone.  Bunches of reviews indicated this was something special.It wasn't.  This movie totally depended on people's fear of the woods and the dark.  I guess for people for whom the woods is scary, this movie probably was.  I'm not only not scared of the woods, even at night, I like it!  I like not being able to see street lights and hear cars and to listen to the sounds of crickets and owls and critters rooting around in the dark.  It's very relaxing.  So I just kept thinking, ""Jeez, these kids just need to go back to Boston or wherever.""  Sticks and stones aren't very scary either.  There are lots of them out there.This was just an updated ""Little Red Riding Hood,""  ""Goldielocks,"" or ""Hansel and Grettel.""  I wasn't very scared of those either as a kid.  There just aren't enough big, bad wolves out there to make them threatening.  And all of the witches I know I kinda like.  They're a bit strange sometimes but basically nice.  I sure don't know any that eat children or make them stand in the corner.  I know I'm supposed to pretend but this movie just couldn't get me to make that jump to ""suspension of disbelief.""My disappointment had nothing to do with the ad campaign.

Eleanor Parker is wonderful as the terrified Marie Allen who gets convicted for driving the getawaycar in this 1949 classic. Considered very daring in it's time, the film still has profound and memorable moments. Hope Emerson is amazing as Matron Evelyn Harper, the epitome of the sadistic prison guard. At an imposing 6 feet 2 inches tall, Emerson convincingly ""put the frear of God"" in all of her minions. Her performance is a film classic. In addition to what has been previously  posted by other reviewers, the camera work is fascinating. Considered a great example of film noir, Caged keeps getting better over the years.

207700,"This episode began one of the running themes of the original series: a deep-seated mistrust of machine-based intelligence. Oddly, TNG reversed this position, suggesting the polar opposite view that Lt. Commander Data was not only a benevolent being, but entitled to full rights as a person. Philosophically, you have to decide for yourself where you sit between these two extreme views. Machine intelligence: demonic or human?Another interesting feature of this episode is that it has echoes of the sci-fi classic ""Forbidden Planet,"" more even than ""The Menagerie."" Kirk beams down to a planet with Nurse Chapel to meet the latter's fiance, Dr. Roger Korby. Not heard from for five years, Korby has discovered the technology of a super, ancient civilization, which is now extinct.It turns out that this race of people was killed by the android servants they created. One of the androids, named Ruk, survives: he is played by Ted Cassidy, who played Lurch in ""The Adams Family."" Korby has discovered how to manufacture androids, as well as (gasp) transfer human consciousness into perfect, forever-young android bodies. To Kirk, this is bad, and Korby must be stopped. Korby tries to get around this by making a duplicate Kirk that he can give orders to.Events in the script suggest Kirk is right. Along with Kirk and Chapel, a couple of the hapless ""guys in red shirts"" beam down. Guess who are Ruk's first victims? A classic ST pattern is established: it's not good to be a guy in a red shirt, unless you're Scotty. Essentially, to android intelligence, life is cheap, and individuals are no more important than just another machine to be turned on or off.Many people who review this episode make much of Andrea (Sherry Jackson), the female android who Korby created as a companion. Chapel is quickly wise to what Korby has been up to. Andrea has soft skin like a woman's and can apparently execute all the normal functions, wink wink nudge nudge. The implication is that she is a very fancy life-sized doll or plaything. In his book ""Star Trek Memories,"" Shatner reports how before ST premiered, Roddenberry hired a model to appear at a sci-fi convention wearing Sherry Jackson's costume from this episode; she had to ""beat men off with a stick."" And it's hard to imagine that this model could have been more alluring than Ms. Jackson herself, who is really something. Hardly any other episode spurs males' fantasies as much as this one.Otherwise, you can watch this episode as a ""machine intelligence is evil"" morality tale, if that's your thing. But much of this episode has a creepy feel to it.",N/A
1130741,"A tired formula gets a shot in the arm by affecting performances in this quaint little film that will touch you.I have grown to really appreciate the acting talent of Steve Carell who really can carry a film.  Carell darn near stole the show inBruce Almightyto the point where the funniest segments were cut from the theatrical release because he upstaged Carrey so much, but those scenes where fortunately made available on the DVD release.  Carell was again the saving grace ofEvan AlmightyandThe 40-Year-Old Virginin which both most likely would have died unnoticed had it not been for his sincere performances.  This comedian definitely knows how to act.  Carell reminds me of the legendary Dick Van Dyke when he had serious roles or moments and Bob Newhart's dry comedic delivery.  It all just seems so effortless on Carell's part.In another affecting performance we have Carell as a widower raising three daughters alone and giving his tidbits of wisdom on doing so in a local column titled ""Dan in Real Life.""  Even though his wife has died four years ago, he has yet to really move beyond that in the way of a relationship.  He has focused all his attention of his children and while that is admirable, a parent is still allowed to look out for himself too.  He has not and the annual fall trip to his parents' cabin plays out all too realistically with everyone pushing him to find someone and he does.He bumps into a lovely woman in town that he's immediately drawn to.  She is played by the ever radiant Oscar winning actress Juliette Binoche, the only reason to seeThe English Patientand one who makes turning 43 seem really cool and desirable.  In the hands of any other actress this role would have been blown out of portion, but in the subtle hands of Binoche, it is a delicate and balanced performance.  Unfortunately, this terrific woman who seems perfect for him is, in reality, his brother's latest flame that he's brought down to the family cabin to meet everyone for the first time because ""this one is different.""Sadly, the effects of this are handled much like a TV-movie or a good episode of that old series ""Love Boat"", or any other sitcom for that matter.  What makes this film ultimately rise above that is admirable work done by the leads.  These are seriously understated performances that are quite touching, believable and memorable in spite of a seriously flawed script at times.Some of the humor in this film is both lame and predictable, but the execution is always dead on.  Again, the performances are the key to this tired formula of the awkward romance.  I guess this film is a good example of style over substance.  Will this save this movie for everyone, no, but I think most might like this film.  I doubt many will love it or even remember it much after seeing it, but it's a nice experience in spite of it's obvious weaknesses.",N/A
812616,"This was one of the later film versions of an Alister Maclean novel, and is a tidy little thriller with little time wasted.Anthony Hopkins plays a secret service agent tasked with solving the pirating of millions of pounds of gold bullion in the North Sea.  This search takes him to remote locations in the Hebrides, unravelling the secrets of a small town where people and yachts have been disappearing.  Being an Alister Maclean novel, nothing and nobody is what they at first appear - the usual ingredients are present and correct - the femme fatale, the damsel in distress, the double crossing, the dour and unstoppable agent... even Maclean's dry sense of humour, which often gets lost in the translation to the big screen, comes through - probably as a result of Maclean writing the screenplay from his novel.The pace of the film is perfect, with a running time of 90 minutes not leaving you feel the film has outstayed its welcome.  The actions scenes are fine, if a little outdated.. the scenes skulking around the castle even reminded me of possibly my favourite Maclean movie - Where Eagles Dare (the actor who played the castle Kommandant, General Rosemeyer,  is also in this movie, making another link).  Music is pretty good for a 70's score, with a brash theme that crops up anytime our hero is running or flying around - which is a significant part of the time.. it's the sort of music which would not have been out of place in an episode of `The Professionals'.  Another piece of inter-movie trivia - the stunts for the movie were done by Vic Armstrong and Bob Simmons, both Bond movie veterans.  Watching this movie, one can almost imagine Hopkins playing Bond.Hopkins plays the cynical Maclean hero well, with the right does of dry humour - and is ably backed up by a great character actor cast - Robert Morley basically plays a more comic version of `M' from the earlier Bond movies, Jack Hawkins has little screen time as Sir Anthony Skouros, and is even voiced over (by Charles Gray, who also appeared in two Bond movies - `Diamonds are forever' and `You only live twice') as he had a voice box owing to his throat cancer.  Nathalie Delon plays the femme fatale role adequately - as far as I can tell, this was one of the few times she appeared in an English speaking role.All in all, a refreshingly taut little thriller which hits the right notes, and has not dated too badly. A cut above other thrillers of its time, recommended for any fans of Maclean or 70's thrillers in general, but not one of his most best movie adaptations.",When Eight Bells Toll
1081517,"While driving home, David Fox (Wilson) swerves to avoid a raccoon.  The car is damaged, and he and his soon to be ex-wife Amy (Beckinsale) must stay at the only motel around to wait for the local garage to open the next day.  The desk manager (Whaley) is Norman Bates-creepy, and the room leaves much to be desired.  Putting a videotape into the VCR in the room, David and Amy are treated to home made snuff films that were made in their hotel room.  Soon, masked men are banging on their door, and David and Amy are in for the night of their lives.At 82 minutes, ""Vacancy"" is lean and mean.  It a tense ride, that does not let up.  Wilson and Beckinsale are great as the ""any person"" couple whose marriage is on the rocks.  It is good to see bigger names in a horror movie, and they get the job done soundly.  Whaley is excellent as one of the creepiest characters to ever inhabit a horror movie.  I would definitely find another place to stay if he was working the front desk at a place I wanted to stay at.  This is an above average horror movie that relies more on tension and creepiness than on blood and gore.  I think that both fans of the genre and non-fans would enjoy this film.

1063936,"""You take LSD and you see sounds, you hear colors,"" says bathtub chemist George Chakiris in the 1969 howler The Big Cube. When he adds, ""Strange things begin to happen,"" he's not just whistling ""Dixie""--this movie ranks in our Top Five All-Time Bad Movies Delights for, among other things, its prolonged, preposterously funny sequences of Lana Turner playing a trippy, LSD-besotted society matron.Poor little rich girl Karin Mossberg learns that her moneybags father Dan O'Herlihy is wedding Turner, who is--of all things--America's greatest stage actress. ""I can't bear that woman!"" cries the distraught girl. Mossberg's best friend, slutty siren Pamela Rodgers, consoles her--""Sweetness, baby, float with the tide. That's my bag. This is a pop art world!""--and cheers her up by taking her to meet some LSD-popping hipster pals at a nightclub called Le Trip. As you might expect, the walls of this pop spot are covered in telling graffiti: Grass is Good; Acid is Love; Cube the Fuzz. Wait a minute--Cube the Fuzz? Well, we don't remember seeing that phrase on the bumper stickers of groovy VW vans back in the good old days, but it does have a certain ring to it. ""Cube"" is, of course, hippie lingo for sugar cubes soaked in LSD, as is made abundantly clear when Rodgers's boyfriend, Carlos East, slips one of them into the beer of a guy he doesn't like, snarling, ""I'm gonna cube that mother, but good!"" ""Fuzz"" is hippie lingo for, of course, cops, as is made abundantly clear when the unsuspecting victim's acid trip, a riotously hammy epileptic fit on the dance floor, is interrupted by the fuzz who rush into the nightclub and arrest him.Meanwhile, Mossberg falls for dropout/drug-pusher/gigolo Chakiris, who, once he sees her car and mansion, brings up the topic of marriage. As soon as dad O'Herlihy and stepmom Turner are out of town, the couple hosts an LSD orgy at the mansion, during which Rodgers does a wicked striptease routine (a favorite pastime of acidheads in the '60s). Unhappily, O'Herlihy and Turner arrive home to see all this naked flesh, and promptly throw the celebrants out. O'Herlihy angrily denounces Chakiris as a fortune hunter, but naturally Mossberg won't listen.The real trouble starts when O'Herlihy is drowned at sea and the widow Turner is named executrix of his estate. Turner follows her late husband's suggestion by making Mossberg's inheritance contingent on her not marrying slimeball Chakiris. ""That's how her kind repays loyalty--with a shaft!"" fumes Chakiris. ""She has everything your father had, including the right to run your life. She poisoned his mind and saw to it that you got nothing."" As Chakiris points out to Mossberg, ""There are ways of dealing with cats like her,"" and since Chakiris's solution to most problems is LSD, we're hardly surprised that his way of dealing with Turner is to add a huge dose of acid to her nightly tranquilizers, then sit back and watch her flip her lid. It proves to be a highly successful plan. Turner is soon staggering around her luxe boudoir, seeing sounds and hearing colors. Later, Turner goes for a spin in her convertible and hallucinates--hilariously--an ocean in the sky, then sees (this is what does her in) the face of Satan. It's all Too Much for Turner. She suffers a mental breakdown and is institutionalized with ""partial amnesia"" (the part of her memory that's missing is, no doubt, the part about why she ever signed on for this movie). ""Maybe there's no perfect murder,"" comments Chakiris, ""but I think we figured a perfect freak-out.""After a court declares Turner mentally incompetent, Mossberg is rich and free to marry Chakiris. Their wedding celebration is a full-tilt '60s happening, replete with couples going at it on the floor and bikers riding their Harleys into the swimming pool. But when Chakiris tries bedding best friend Rodgers instead of his bride on his wedding night, Mossberg realizes belatedly that he's no good. She quickly divorces the scumbag. Now penniless, Chakiris starts gobbling so many ""sugar"" cubes he goes completely bonkers himself.Worried that she's done Turner wrong, Mossberg confesses all to Turner's secret new flame, Richard Egan (America's greatest playwright). ""Suppose she relived the part of her life she's trying to forget,"" ponders Egan with a straight face. ""What if I could write a play based on her experiences, then convince her to play herself?"" Thus, Turner is let out of the loony bin to star in a loony play with the loony plot of this loony movie. On opening night, she suddenly realizes she's enacting her own real-life saga and breaks down sobbing onstage, repeating over and over, ""I'm not mad! I'm not mad!"" Though the audience's response to Turner's statement is to shout ""Bravo!"" yours will be to shout ""Yes, you are!""",The Big Cube

680236,"""Fishing With Gandhi"" is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. This low budget wonder follows the adventures of Danno, a troubled hitchhiker, and his road trip with perpetual slackers Roy and Gil. Significant plot point revolve around badminton, puppy diseases, and wrestling moves such as the ""Brazilian Guillotine"" and ""Fishing With Gandhi,"" which Roy and Gil demonstrate with aplomb to hapless Danno.Believe it or not this film harkens back to ""Hamlet"", in that Danno is upset that his uncle has taken advantage of his father's recent (possibly suspicious?) death and married his mother, while Roy and Gil are near perfect Rosencrantz and Guildenstern analogs. I know this sounds insane, but I didn't make it up: I found it out from the director's commentary. After I thought about what was said, re-watched the film, and skimmed my copy of ""Hamlet"", I had no choice but to agree, which added dramatically to the deliciously subtle humor of the film for me.The cast is letter perfect and small details are done extremely well: I was especially amused by Christina Milano's portrayal of ""Bronte"", the weird Ophelia of the film who becomes seemingly more demented (as in ""Hamlet"") as the movie goes on. I especially love her scene where she breaks down into hysterics on recalling a nature documentary in which a water buffalo crosses an alligator infested river. She says that she needs to ""helicopter"" above the pain. Her companion responds ""Can you talk from the helicopter?"" Her answer, of course, is ""Sure, I'm hovering above the pain right now."" Which elicits from her companion the considerate, yet hilarious, line ""Do you want to hover by yourself for a while?"" Nuanced dialogue like this peppers the film, and makes it an absolute treat to watch in comparison to over-promoted Hollywood productions.The DVD has a lot of extra features including a wonderful commentary track, extensive outtakes, a director's introduction (which I loved), the theatrical trailer, and a wonderful animated short featuring Roy and Gil in the psychiatrist's office. Their description to the psychiatrist of the medications they are currently taking is priceless.This movie has a lot of subtlety to it, and is viewable on a number of levels. I recommend watching it as a straight comedy first, then watch for increasing nuance with further viewings. It is truly a film like no other, and I recommend it highly. If you can, try to find a copy of the even rarer Roy and Gil movie, ""Cow Monkey"", in which they pursue bigfoot.""Fishing With Gandhi"" isn't for everyone, but for the people it's intended for it is a wonderful experience.",Fishing With Gandhi
1052933,"Todd Field's digression from ""In the Bedroom"" to ""Little Children"" can only be compared to Paul Thomas Anderson's sinking from the gritty, realistic ""Boogie Nights"" to the lackluster ""Punch Drunk Love"" a few years later (from there Anderson basically dropped from sight for the next half-decade -- will Field's fate be the same?). Halfway through ""Children"" I was so bored I began googling the names of old high school classmates just to pass the time. The biggest problem I have with the movie is the spouses of Kate Winslet & Patrick Wilson. Winslet's husband is an internet-porn addicted loser and Wilson's (Jennifer Connelly) is a shrew who cares more about her work and her child than she does her husband. By portraying the spouses this way Field basically gives Winslet and Wilson a free pass to commit adultery which removes the elements of moral dilemma, suspense, and drama from their actions. Jackie Earle Haley's character, rather than being sympathetic, is just a loser, much like the spouses, so we don't really care about him either.

1045333,"If you're in to sadistic horror and outlandish gore, you might think that this is the movie for you. Unfortunately you'll be HORRORifically unimpressed. Freakshow stumbles along on a tightrope-thin plot vaguely circling around a group of workers planning to make off with a load of money by sending an unbridled tramp to seduce a circus master with laughably fake boils on his face.Try as you might, there's hardly a coherent plot to be found anywhere in this tedious botch job of a horror movie. Dirty sex abounds throughout, but for the most part, it ends up disturbing more than tittilating.This film advertises itself as being ""banned in 43 countries"". That's a good gimmick really. Until you realize that it was probably banned for being a meaningless jumble of adolescent pseudo-horror thrown together in a jumble by a few producers trying to make a buck off of exploiting the idea that they are using ""REAL FREAKS"". There are no sideshow types in this film. There is a midget, a man with no legs, a man with no arms, a big bald guy, a latexed Elephant Man ripoff, an Amazonian porn star, a guy with hair glued to his face (dogman), and a half-man/half-woman... none of these are ""freaks"" per se.Overall this movie is tremendously disappointing, and I'd like to help prevent future viewers of this movie from coming anywhere near it because it really is the lowest form of filmmaking to be so pretentious as to use a gimmick like the phrase ""freak"" to sell a hodge-podge of bad acting, cheesy gore, and hastily thrown together murder scenes.The murders are not interesting, the sex scenes are awkward, the gore is fake looking, and the script will leave you wanting to stick hooks into your own skin.The DVD has several special features, which are just as painful to watch as the film itself. The only cool part of the entire DVD is watching the man with no arms drive with his feet in a behind the scenes featurette. And that's only a few seconds.Please don't buy this movie. Don't even rent it. You will regret it. No matter how much you think you might be interested in this, I can promise that you won't be. I love horror movies: bad horror, gory horror, even cheesy horror. This is just low budget horror mascarading as something worthwhile. I suggest you bypass this garbage and get something that pulls off the ""so offensive it's interesting"" genre, like Bloodsucking Freaks or pretty much any John Waters film.As a final note, I'd like to point out that Freakshow is a remake of the 1932 horror film Freaks, and while the original is exciting and surprisingly interesting even today, Freakshow is a terribly executed remake vaguely following the original plot but tossing in needless sex and violence, and confusing the story to the point of being nonsensical.",N/A
199054,"Duck Soup is one of the classic rammed-to-the-gunnells gag movies. Its influence throughout so much later cinema, such as Woody Allen, Airplane perhaps is paramount, and there are certainly classic episodes such as the mirror scene. But I found that many of the gags fell flat, wordplay that was neither very clever or very funny, and some of the parody aspect such as the music hall comedy pastiche looks rather dated and not in a immortal, timepiece type of way. For me, I prefer the slapstick of Woody Allen's earlier films, but the Marx brothers are well up there as classic comic producers of all time, so who am I to say. I just found lines such as: 'Keep it under your hat, no, tell you what, I'll keep it under my hat' didn't ring many comedic cherries.",N/A
684905,"Before he went all soporific on everybody. Before he made the ill-advised ""Philadelphia"" and then the cleverer ""Forrest Gump"", Hanks was actually a fairly broad comic actor. Some of his movies hit the mark, like ""Splash"" and ""The Money Pit"", and others bombed badly, like ""The Man With One Red Shoe"" and ""Bachelor Party"". He was great at playing overly-confident, affable yuppies that were almost always put-upon in the extreme or finding themselves in odd situations, like he did in this one.In this movie, Hanks plays David Basner, a hotshot adman in Chicago, with comical co-workers and upper-middle-aged parents that are breaking up. While he tries romancing the daughter of a major client, (Sela Ward, hubba-hubba!) he also has to deal with his poor father (Jackie Gleason) losing his wife of 40 years and his job, all within the same month! The ""tough love"" tenderness Basner uses with his dad is offset by the kid gloves he uses with his mother, played by Eva Marie Saint. There are some ingenious comic scenes in this film, such as the ad company presentation to the Texan airline owner client, father of the Sela Ward character, (the woman with the guitar voicing the old lady on the plane is priceless,) and some other ad proposals are done well too. However, it is the later scenes with Max, his father, that will probably get to you the most. This was Jackie Gleason's last movie, and it is LIGHT YEARS better than most of the stuff he starred in late in his career, specifically the ""Smokey & The Bandit"" movies and ""The Sting II"". Hanks would go on to make ""Joe Versus The Volcano"", which was really Meg Ryan's movie more than his, his last broad comedy, and then made ""A League of Their Own"", which changed his career as well as saved it. There was no looking back after ""Philadelphia"", which was actually his first totally dramatic role.Frankly, I kinda miss the affable yuppy Hanks and would love to see him in another ""Money Pit"".Whaddya say, Tom....huh?",N/A

Poor people who actually live there in its worst slum called the ""City of God,"" built by the government to isolate them from the rich tourists in the city center, can tell you it is more like a precinct of hell.

I say all of that so you can compare your configuration with mine. I would say that the video quality is better and anyone who says that it is not is just being negative. I understand this negativity because honestly if you own Saw on DVD, I do not, I would guess that it looks nearly as good especially 1080i with Faroudja. However I have to say that the sound difference was stunning. I may be alone on this but I am as much a sound guy as I am a video guy and the uncompressed PCM in 7.1 was insane.

I believe the original story was written by a young Elmore Leonard.  The bombastic Frankie Laine soundtrack tune is pretty good too.

971715,"_Casshern_ (2004) is an excellent Japanese superhero science fiction film written and directed by Kazuaki Kiriya that deals with some of the profound questions of our time.  The film is in many ways a Japanese version of _Brave New World_ showing the role of the state in war and the role of personal greed in prolonging war and causing death.  The film is set in the Twenty-First century featuring an earth in crisis.  War has long raged between Europa and Asia and eventually this war results in the formation of an Eastern Federation.  Geneticists seek to create a healing mechanism making use of ""Neo-Cells"" which can rejuvenate the human body.  However, in order to do so they must plunder the bodies of those who live in Zone 7, who are deemed to be terrorists.  Dr. Azuma leads the front in the creation of these ""Neo-Cells"" in a mad effort to prolong human life (ultimately prompted by nothing more than old-fashioned human greed).  Despite the warnings of Dr. Azuma, his own son Tetsuya decides to go to war leaving behind his girlfriend Luna and his mother.  However, Tetsuya is tragically killed in battle.  It is at this point that a miracle occurs and a bolt of lightning strikes the tanks holding the ""Neo-Cells"" causing them to recombine to form human beings - known as the ""Neo-Sapiens"".  The humans decide to start hunting down the non-human Neo-Sapiens; however, the Neo-Sapiens have other plans and will make use of Europa's old robot army.  Ironically, Dr. Azuma decides to restore his own son to life by placing him in a vat containing the Neo-Cells, and thus is born Casshern, a warrior superhero and the resurrected form taken on by Tetsuya.  The rest of the film focuses on the conflict between Tetsuya as Casshern and the Neo-Sapiens as well as the palace intrigue surrounding the rulers of the Eastern Federation and the evil corporation sponsoring the geneticists.  Ultimately, this film will bring forth difficult questions such as ""Why must we fight?"" and ""Why is there not peace?"".  The film also touches on the potentially harmful effects that may result from mankind's tampering with nature through genetics.  The moral questions faced by those who seek to prolong life, even if that means depriving others of life, are faced directly in this film.  Questions of war and peace, love and life, and the devastating consequences which result from human greed are profoundly touched upon in this action movie.  As such, I believe this movie is worth watching and despite the fact that it is billed as an action movie, the subtle questions posed by this film cannot be avoided because we face the same sorts of questions in our world today.",Casshern (DVD)

1099133,"This story goes back and forth in time--through dreamlike memories of a dying woman--as she tries to piece together an important chapter of her life. Claire Danes plays the young ""Ann"" during a weekend in 1953 when she is the Maid of Honor at her best friend's wedding. There she meets a man, Harris, with whom she unexpectedly falls in love. Their moments together--what ultimately only seem like moments in a very long life--are romantic and memorable, and they forever have stars in the sky to remind them of one another after they travel separate paths through adulthood. For the aged Ann (played by Vanessa Redgrave), Harris was the one that got away.Ann's adult daughters, (Toni Collette and Natasha Richardson) keeping vigil at her deathbed, clearly love their mother and were clearly loved by her. The daughters each face their own (relatively mundane) struggles, but struggles nonetheless, and want very much for their mother to provide the answers and continue to show them the way toward fulfillment.This is a beautiful movie, and I recommend especially for mothers, daughters, sisters and best friends. I loved it.",N/A

385191,"This film does not need more reviews, but I can not help myself.  It is one of my all time favourites.  Unlike many of Ray Harryhausen's films, it is not just a special effects vehicle, but a very solid science fiction thriller, straight out of the paranoid 1950's sf school.This was one of Harryhausen's earliest films, coming just before he went into colour with The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.  It benefits from solid (if unremarkable) acting, and even more from a basic script that covers every base it should.  As a result, it has been copied (i.e., ripped off) about a zillion times.  Even Tim Burton paid it homage in his Mars Attacks (a film I find almost unwatchable).The fifties was a paranoid era for the US, with an overriding fear of communism coming just after several yeras of horrific war.  Just as the Japanese used Gojira (Godzilla, in the US version) to personify certain fears and themes, Harryhausen and crew used flying saucers. Where the Japanese film was somber and sad, however, this effort was strictly an entertainment.The film works just like the best science fiction short stories and novels from the period.  Odd things are seen in the sky, leading to alien contact (misunderstood) with Dr. Marvin and his sweetie.  Misunderstandings with the aliens leads naturally to them attacking.  The movie's plot is fast, believable (as long as once accepts the premise) and full of steady surprises, skipping quickly from one major plot point to the next.As noted, Harryhausen was really coming into his own here, with his budgets increasing after the success of The Beast from Twenty Thousand Fathoms and It Came From Beneath the Sea.  The saucers are excellent, in particular for the sense of movement he gave them.  The most is made from a small budget.For my money, Harryhausen's handcrafted special effects rule!  Today's CGI work looks increasingly like toons, with little individual character.  If you've never seen this film, buy it--you're in for a treat.",Earth vs the Flying Saucers VHS
946593,"The first thing I want to say is that this movie does not glorfy war.  I was also glad that this movie was not a 'Saving Private Ryan/Thin Red Line' type of production.  It was a drama, a movie in the 1960s or 70s type or style.  It had more of a look and feel of a 'Patton,' ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" or ""Longest Day"" to it, not like the 'Battle of the Buldge' though.The story itself was gripping enough, only five days to extract over 500 prisoners who were destined to die at the hands of their captors who wished to kill them because they viewed them as animals.I think the movie also gave a lot of lessons around one of the most ignored areas of World War II.  The Phillipines has mostly been ignored in movies about that epic in history.  This movie covers that part of the war in an overview fashion, even with a bit of a documentary at the beginning.The DVD has some great historical extras like the interactive timeline of the whole war and interviews of some of those who were involved in the great raid.  The Captain Dale Dye piece was also informative on how the movie was made and the training that the actors had to go through in a bootcamp setting for over two weeks.I really liked the story of sacrifice for men who were left to basically rot for a myriad of reasons by the US.  Really, there was no Navy to save them or to get to them since the first attacks of the Phillipines were just days after Pearl Harbor.  The fact that there were so many fighting men that languished in Corregador and main island of the Phillipines was almost appalling.  Most of the men died on the way to the prison camps in what is known as the Bataan Death March.  This alone, the history, is worth the whole time watching the movie.  Since there is no gore, kids could watch it without too much difficulty.I think the thing that got to me the most was seeing the footage of the real heroes and survivors of the raid and of the captives.  It was very touching to see video of what happened to them after they were freed.  To say the least, this was a very well done movie and since it was done in more of an old fashion way, the lessons learned and the desire and drive of all of the men and women involved makes for a huge lesson in sacrifice for your fellow man.The movie has three main locations it focuses on:  The capital of Manila, where the underground was fighting its fight, the prison camp where the prisoners were trying to stay alive fighting disease and deprivation, and with the soldiers who were their saviors from the beach head to the eventual attack and extraction at the camp.There is a lot of history covered in this great film.  Worth it for the whole family to watch since there are heroes and heroines.This definately rates among the top of the movies in my collection.Joe Slevin",N/A

There isn't any scaley, slimey thing popping out from behind a spaceship bulkhead and snarling.  No, this monster shares the same DNA as you and I.  It's a human creature, and sometimes a charming one, at that.I have been interested in issues of human evil for some time, as I have heard the word ""evil"" overused and mis-used quite a bit (I actually know people who describe dissenters in their church as ""evil"" - really!)  Real human evil (as opposed to mere name-calling) gets a good movie treatment in this motion picture, and also gets a good scholarly treatment in this book:Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass KillingI know that Forest Whitaker won a well-deserved Academy Award as best actor for his performance, here.  I recall him as being quite warm and soft-spoken in his Oscar acceptance speech.  He seemed a sweet and gentle soul.  Even so, I honestly would not get in an elevator with him after seeing this picture.  I know that's a strange thing to say, but I wouldn't.  I also read somewhere that he would come home to his wife ""in character"" after a day of shooting this movie.  She must be a wonderful woman. I would have divorced the SOB.  He scared me.

I think this was one of the last roles that Joe Flynn played before he died in a tragic pool accident - as a bumbling, inept surgeon whose primary function was the issuing of death certificates for his patients!!  The manner in which Stockard dispatched her enemies was as artful and as witty as the persona beneath the plain initial exterior - the way she disposed of the people who caused her such emotional and phyiscal pain and was ingenious - drowning of her former fiance in the bathroom of their motel room, the bubble headed cheerleader who backflipped her way out of the dorm's upper floor's window, the medical intern who succumbed to fate by appendectomy amongst other equally gruesome (but very ingenious) methods for her tormentors, with Ed Asner as her law-enforcement nemisis who not only captured her but also her heart.  I felt this was a movie for the underdog - a light at the end of the dark tunnel - that every (under)dog will have their day - although I'm not one to recommend murder as the way to deal with torment - it was nice to see that bullies dont always win in the end - and I'm glad to see that it finally made it to DVD!!!!",N/A

175242,"11-year-old Evan wants nothing more in life than to find his parents, or for them to find him. Labeled a freak by his fellow boys home residents it isn't long before he finds himself on the streets of New York in search of the mother and father he never knew. Like a fish out of water, the sights and sounds of the city that never sleeps are at once overwhelming and intoxicating. In every thumping foot, squealing tire, barking dog and rattling chain he hears a rhythm. Music. Harmonics no one hears but him. He knows if he just follows the music somehow his parents will find him. What he doesn't know is that his parents have no idea he exists.Ten years ago his mother, Lyla (Keri Russell), a gifted celoist, was a young prodigy herself when she met Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the talented lead singer and guitarist for an Irish rock band. Immediately they share a bond, and their night together changes everything. Can the power of music bring this family of strangers back together again?Don't let the somewhat un-inspiring title August Rush fool you. This movie is a heart-warming film with a rich narrative, visually diverse settings, and a lush original music score. Freddie Highmore's spot-on performance as Evan, who soon takes up the moniker August Rush, immediately invokes our sympathy. We truly care what happens to this bright-eyed, innocent boy who hasn't let himself become jaded by his harsh environment. (If he looks familiar it's probably because of his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Finding Neverland fame. He played the lead child roles in both.)But it's not just Highmore who carries this movie. Every actor nails their role beautifully. Keri Russell (perhaps known best for the TV show Felicity) is a natural on the screen, skillfully bringing to life the character of Lyla both as a naive young woman and a passionate mother. Robin Williams' supporting role as a music pimp to a brood of unwanted yet musically gifted children cinches that he can play the deeper roles right alongside his lighter comedy ones. You'll also want to take notice of Terrence Howard's performance as social worker Richard Jeffries, a man in the system who genuinely cares for the kids under his care but often finds his hands frustratingly tied.A few times suspension of disbelief is called for as August Rush is more about the fantastic than the realistic. It's a little hard to believe Evan is able to play both the guitar and organ like a master (not to mention conduct an orchestra) without ever having seen or touched the instruments before in his life. But you really don't mind. This movie has enough heart to carry it above and beyond those moments. Its portrayal of music's magic, that powerful tug on the human heart and soul, sets it apart from your average film tackling the same subjects.Parents will appreciate the filmmaker's tact in portraying Lyla and Louis' one-night stand. No more than the beginnings of a passionate kiss are shown. A few swear words (h-- and d--) probably aren't appropriate for youngsters since several are uttered by children, but they really did have their place in showing you the hard existence of some of the street kids.August Rush reminds us that amidst the hardships there truly is some good left in this world. You'll come away from this movie with a greater appreciation of music's power, not to mention the power of love and family. Definitely worth seeing more than once.--Reviewed by C.J.

In contradiction to whatever it was that set my expectations low, I will set yours relatively high.The Illusionist was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. And it's basically a 4-person show by Edward Norton (Eisenheim the Illusionist), Paul Giamatti (Inspector Uhl), Jessica Biel (Sophie) and Rufus Sewell (The Crown Prince); All 4 giving real A-list performances.Perhaps my low expectations were because The Illusionist was released right around the same time as Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, and I therefore at the time had a case of Magician-Movie-Overload. Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with The Illusionist during its first week on DVD. It was so good that, after viewing it on the way home from a business trip, I watched a second showing at home with my wife.My wife liked the movie as much as I did, and that's saying a lot based on her usual ""where do you find these movies"" comment after watching one of my DVD picks.The Illusionist is part Romeo and Juliet period drama based in turn of the century (no not the last one, the one before) Vienna.  It's part psychological drama...a kind of whodunit with a clever, but somewhat predictable twist. And the Illusionist is part magic show.A lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic...in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so. Don't expect to go into this movie and be truly amazed by wizardry. But the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, and I believe the intention was to deliberately raise the question of how tales of necromancy could have been inspired. The answer?

The album and concert film are radically different though in their track sequences.The album had The Spirit of Radio (not in film), Red Barchetta (same version as on the ESL film), YYZ (complete on album with full Neil Peart solo unlike on ESL film), A Passage To Bangkok (recorded in 1980 and not in film), Closer To The Heart (recorded in 1980 and different from film version), Beneath Between and Behind (recorded in 1980 and not in film), Jacob's Ladder (recorded in 1980 and not in film), Broon's Bane (not in film in complete state), The Trees and Xanadu (both tracks were recorded on a different night as opposed to ESL video), Freewill (recorded on different night as opposed to ESL film), Tom Sawyer (recorded on different night as opposed to ESL film) and La Villa Strangiato (not in film).Its off-shoot concert film consisted of The Camera Eye (intro)(not on album), Limelight (a superb version which was not released on the album but eMptyTV (when it was MTV) used to air this clip ALOT), Tom Sawyer(slightly different to the version on the ESL album), The Trees (slightly different to the version on the ESL album), Xanadu (slightly different to the version on the ESL album), Red Barchetta (same as on ESL album), Freewill (slightly different to the version on the ESL album), Closer To The Heart (different to the version on the ESL album), YYZ (shortened with interviews featuring Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart), By-Tor and the Snow Dog/In The End/In The Mood/2112 Finale (not on ESL album) and YYZ finale and interviews featuring Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart are sprinkled throughout the film.If you combine both the DVD and CD you almost get complete show except for Vital Signs (which was only released as B-side to New World Man), Hemispheres: Armageddon, Working Man (with reggae intro), The Camera Eye(complete), Hemispheres: Prelude and Natural Science.The next concert on Rush Replay X 3 is Grace Under Pressure Live 1984 and was the only one without a live album (until now as it appears here for the first time on CD). This concert was filmed in September of 1984 at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.The band starts off with The Three Stooges Theme followed by The Spirit of Radio, The Whole Original Fear Trilogy (The Enemy Within (previously released on Prime Mover single), The Weapon (with film featuring Count Floyd (Joe Flaherty of SCTV fame) and Witch Hunt), New World Man (previously released on Prime Mover single), Distant Early Warning, Red Sector A (previously released on Big Money single and Chronicles DVD), Closer To The Heart, medley of YYZ/The Temples of Syrinx/Tom Sawyer. Finally, Vital Signs and the medley of Finding My Way/In The Mood.The only songs missing are Subdivisions, The Body Electric, Between the Wheels, Red Barchetta, Kid Gloves and Red Lenses (with drum solo) but maybe the footage and multi-tracks were lost so that is why they are not here.Finally, we have A Show of Hands which was filmed in late April 1988 at the National Exhibition Centre (or NEC Arena to us Americans) in Birmingham, England. Like Exit... Stage Left, the A Show Of Hands film have songs that are on the album and not on video and vice versa.The album version of A Show of Hands consisted of Intro, The Big Money, Subdivisions (not on the video), Marathon, Turn the Page (different version than video), Manhattan Project (different version than video), Mission(different version than video), Distant Early Warning(not on video), Mystic Rhythms(not on video), Witch Hunt (not on video), The Rhythm Method(just the drum solo section almost complete save for the YYZ intro (which is on video and Red Lenses ending), Force Ten(different version than video), Time Stand Still (not on video), Red Sector A and Closer to the Heart.The A Show Of Hands film track listing consisted of:Intro (film with Three Stooges music), The Big Money, Marathon, Turn The Page, Prime Mover (not on album), Manhattan Project, Closer To The Heart, Red Sector A, Force Ten, Mission, Territories(not on album), YYZ(not on album)/The Rhythm Method (most of solo is present except for electronic drum finale and Red Lenses), The Spirit Of Radio (not on album), Tom Sawyer (with animated film and not on album), 2112 (Overture/The Temples of Syrinx)(not on album), La Villa Strangiato (not on album) and In The Mood (not on album).The songs that were also played on tour but not included on either the album or video are Limelight and Red Lenses (Lock and Key was on the laser disc of ASoH).Rush Replay X 3 also includes miniature replicas of the original tour booklets from the three tours which these videos were filmed.Three DVDs plus a bonus live CD and three mini replicas of the Moving Pictures, Grace Under Pressure and Hold Your Fire tour booklets for a list price of $40 is to steal the lyric of a Who song ""a bargain, the best I ever had!!!"" and that ain't no lie!The versions initially sold at Best Buy had bonus tracks on the CD containing Limelight and Closer from the ESL DVD and Spirit and Tom Sawyer from ASoH DVD.Hugely RECOMMENDED!",N/A
918656,"I didn't really expect Nero to be a good guy.  I understood him to be something of an insane monster similar to Caligula... and the movie eventually portrays him as such, but the transmogrification occurs so gradually that I really wondered at times how it would be pulled off.  I truly appreciate the way the story unfolds at a deliberate pace without rushing too much or dragging too much.  Wardrobing deserves special acknowledgement both for the Roman soldiers and for the opulent nobles. I rated this movie pretty highly because compared to other endeavors at dramatizing Roman times... I felt this one came off a bit more believably.  I was also surprised by the strong dose of Christianity in the film. . . and I would argue that the dialogue delivered by the Apostle Paul was too reliant on passages from his epistles.  Like Rome is burning and he starts quoting his own Biblical writings in some kind of soliloquy... not quite plausible in my estimation.  Otherwise I liked his character.",Nero

183478,Like all Japanese softporn movies Weather Woman is interesting from the standpoint of allowing us to exam a foreign culture and I'm sure there are many culturally pertinent things in the movie we Americans will never understand but that's what makes it such a trip. On the negative side is that typical childlike silliness that seems to invade these kind of movies and it becomes a bit repulsive. But we don't mind do we?

980992,"Along with ""Anna Christie"", these are two great adaptations of plays by O'Neil. Here we have a wonderful cast of typical Ford actors: John Wayne, Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald... a script by Dudley Nichols (Stagecoach), and a unique photography by Greg Tolland (Citizen Kane). Directed all by John Ford; what else can you wish for?So what is it that keeps ""The Long Voyage Home"" from being one of Ford's greatest films? I think there's more of the spirit of Ford here than of O'Neil: The tabern brawls, the excess of drinking, the fist fights, the omnipresent Irishness... his seal is stamped all over the film, which -to me- takes away from the original plays. O'Neil liked this take on his plays? Sure, it's John Ford directing. But it's one more case of a great literary work that doesn't translate -as one would wish- to the big screen.And what about the rough sea scenes? Makes ""The Deadliest Catch"" look like children's stuff. Sad and beautiful film. A poem in black and white about men at sea.",N/A
809195,"With YOSSI & JAGGER (2002) the director Eyton Fox gives the viewer an extraordinary first movie that foreshadows the even better film WALK ON WATER (2004) although he has nothing to be embarrassed about with this fine production. Yossi (Ohad Knoller) and Jagger, so nicknamed because he is as handsome as a rockstar (Yehuda Levi), are young Israeli soldiers stationed at the cold Israeli-Lebanese border. Their story is simple and straight-forward. They are lovers in time of war and have to keep their love secret in very close quarters.While I do not want to spoil the ending for those who haven't seen this film, there is a particularly bittersweet scene near the end of the movie when Jagger's mother remembers that there were so many things about him that she never knew. There is the obligatory romance that a young woman soldier fabricates with Jagger and her. She does everything she can think of while in combat to bed him, even supposedly losing a contact lens when her nose is inches from his. She never gets it; it is amazing that even in 2004 that straight women still act this way around gay men. Of course Yossi in a sad poignant moment recalls Jagger's favorite song, a fact that no one else knew.This sweet, sad film is not to be missed.",N/A
157467,"""A Bucket of Blood"" is not one of my favorite Roger Corman films and it has been passed around to various public domain companies for years.  The MGM version is the one to get and an official release with the best picture quality.  Don't be discouraged if it isn't widescreen as seen on TCM.  This was filmed in 1.37 to be played in 1.66 ratio.  What you get here is an open matte version meaning you see the entire scene shot by the camera before a mask is added to make it widescreen cutting the top and bottom for theater screen showings.  This is NOT the same as Pan & Scan v. Widescreen.  In fact, some releases done this way will find microphone booms at the top of the screen which would be hidden with the mask later on.  You actually get more picture here rather than less :-)The MGM DVD is still available so there is no reason to buy cheaper quality versions especially if you are a Corman fan.",N/A

229463,"When it comes to Charles Dickens `A Christmas Carol' I personally loath musicals . To me, they take away from the story. When I saw `Scrooge' I was 12 years old. It was Christmas Eve and decided to sit through it. Back when I was a kid there was no cable TV. We were limited as to how many channels we got. Needless to say, from the second I saw the opening credits, I was hooked on the movie. It became a tradition. I remember watching it one Christmas and how disappointed I was that they cut out a huge scene of Scrooge in Hell. I could not believe how they could do such a thing. When I saw that this movie was available on DVD in wide screen and surround sound, I immediately ordered my copy from Amazon. To me, this movie brings back so many great movies. I would not hesitate to recommend the movie to anyone.",N/A
716561,"I first saw this sequel many years ago in French class and it was probably one of the most beautiful pieces of poetry set to film that I had ever seen.  For those of you unfamiliar with the first in this two part film series, I really reccomend that you watch LA GLOIRE DE MON PERE (MY FATHER'S GLORY) before seeing LE CHATEAU DE MA MERE (MY MOTHER'S CASTLE).  This second part is based on the teen years of writer Marcel Pagnol and some of the most profound memories he had from that time of his life.  It follows him, his family and the people who cross his path along the way.  We see the triumphs and the tragedies and all incidents are depicted with grace and beauty (even when they are the most painful to watch).  Everything from the separation that occurs between parent and child to childhood crushes are shown in a very natural and believable way.  What's more, the cinematography just makes the scenes soar.  Some of the sequences appear as if out of a luscious landscape painting.  Whether you are a Francophile or someone new to foreign film, I highly reccomend this.",N/A

Other comics we have never heard of who spent more time roasting each other than Shatner got more DVD time than Nichelle.  Ben Stiller's relating George Takei's coming out with molesting children is offensive beyond even roasting.  And the entire segment shown on TV of Leonard Nimoy's phone conversation with William Shatner is entirely eliminated.  In the end, Shatner's closing remark that, despite all the material he had given the roasters to work with and they still couldn't nail him, was RIGHT ON!

24866,"Criterion has just released the new 2-disc transfer of 1938's ""The Lady Vanishes"", Alfred Hitchcock's last great British effort; filmed just before he was swallowed-up by David O. Selznick and Hollywood. Just before the war, the beautiful young Iris(Margaret Lockwood), traveling across Europe by train, meets the governess Miss Froy(Dame May Whitty), a charming old spinster, who promptly disappears into thin air. In fact, no one even recalls having seen the old lady aboard the train.  Iris turns sleuth, and soon finds herself drawn into a complex murder-mystery and robust adventure. The fictitous country where most of the story takes place is named in the movie by Miss Froy in her first scene:  ""Bandrika is one of Europe's few undiscovered corners"".  ""The Lady Vanishes"" is a love story, two daffy, English gents, and two car-loads of Nazi's, all tossed together in a quick-witted, devilish comic thriller. Droll English humor keeps the proceedings moving along.  In one scene, Iris complains: ""Hello, Boris? Miss Henderson speaking. Look, someone upstairs is playing musical chairs with an elephant. Move one of them out, will you? I want to get some sleep"".  A remarkable cast includes Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave, Paul Lucas, and Dame May Whitty. As the redoubtable Miss Froy, Whitty easily steals the entire film. The final sequence is just short of perfect. Dame May Whitty died at age 82 from cancer in Beverly Hills, shortly after her scenes in the movie ""The Sign of the Ram(1948)"". She once said, ""I've got everything Betty Grable has...only I've had it longer"".  Modestly budgeted, ""The Lady Vanishes"" was shot on studio stages, and relied on miniatures, rear-projection, stock footage, transparencies, and one ninety-foot-long railroad set. The real meat of the film is it's nimble acting and dynamic screenplay. There's a lot to chew on here. Criterion released ""The Lady Vanishes"" in 1998 with less results; it suffered poor video and sound drop-out.  There is one drop-out at 18 minutes into the film, but otherwise you have a high-quality transfer.  This new high-definition digital transfer was taken from a 35 mm composite fine-grain master positive, and audio restoration has reduced clicks, pops, and hiss.  Extras include audio commentary by Bruce Eder(a little dry), ""Crook's Tour"", a 1941 feature with Basil Radford and Nuanton Wayne reprising their roles from ""The Lady Vanishes"", Francois Truffaut's 1962 interview with Alfred Hitchcock, a new video essay by scholar Leonard Leff, an essay by critic Geoffrey O'Brien, photos, and art. Alfred Hitchcock made 37 cameo appearances in his films(from 1926 to 1976). 90 minutes into ""The Lady Vanishes"", you can see him walking along the platform of London's Victoria Station, wearing a black coat and puffing on a cigarette.  Alfred Hitchcock changed the way movies are made; both long ago, and right up until the end.  We're so glad he did.",N/A
1103321,"I must admit that I found myself a little bored at times, not to mention that some of the dialogue was pretty bad. I actually liked the movie more as it approached an hour or so into the mayhem. Bruce Willis did seem to be just going through the motions, especially early on, but he still had some clever lines and action scenes later in the film. Justin Long, as the helpless computer nerd, was much funnier than I thought he would be and really got the most laughs out of my packed theater.All in all, the PG-13 rating didn't hurt the violence one bit, but having John McClane not throw aroung the F word every few lines really felt out of place in a Die Hard movie. Even his famous line is muffled by a gunshot.Still worth seeing if you like mindless action, with a little humor thrown in for good measure.3.5 out of 5 stars",N/A

The hardships that both of them have to go through in dealing with life and with developing romantic relationships and friendships with their family and among themselves are worth watching. This movie makes a heterosexual person who is happy in her skin realize how good she has it and how confusing and difficult it is for someone who isn't in today's society. It's impossible to imagine how much harder it must be for a twin, one of a whole to deal with the entire issue.

499086,"This historical epic is definitely Hollywood-ized, but Hollywood-ized in the best sense: there are lavish sets, rich technicolor costumes, big dramatic situations, and biting dialogue.  And it's definitely intelligent Hollywood-ization, too, as I'm betting there's enough truth here about the real-life situation between Elizabeth I and Lord Essex to give one at least a rudimentary grounding in that situation.  And a painless grounding it is: just sit back and enjoy the verbal jousting and inflamed passions between Bette Davis and Errol Flynn.  History was never so entertaining.An overall wonderful print (only occasionally marred by a blurry, misaligned technicolor shot) is accompanied by some interesting special features.  The oddest one is a short subject about a little kid who runs a kingdom about to be overthrown, until a Wild West show comes to town to save the day.  There's also a rare serious-in-tone Warner Brothers cartoon from 1938 or so, depicting Porky Pig learning to appreciate our nation's history and what the words behind the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" mean.  Interestingly, the words ""under God"" don't appear in Porky's (or Warner Brothers') version of the circa-1938 pledge.  So, the belief in a separation between church and state DIDN'T start with modern-day ""lefties""?  Funny what you can learn from an old cartoon... talk about ""out of the mouths of babes"".",The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex VHS
1041570,"I don't even want to really review this one.When did Trent turn into Henry Rollins??  And before you superfans read further, yes I gave ""Year Zero"" a real lashing and think that he's lost his touch.I'm glad that a number of other reviewers thought ""And All That Could Have Been"" was better than this, because I tend to agree, though they are one in the same.  I think the sound quality (both instrumentally and vocally) in AATCHB is much better... probably because Trent spent a lot more time engineering that in post.  I think the tour visuals are better in ""Beside You in Time""  It's not really worth the price tag... I think I got it on sale for ten bucks so it was a decent buy for me... and is it me or is Trent's voice starting to go?  Perhaps the most important critique here of all that people fail to note is that AATCHB and BYIT take a major back seat to the first NIN tour documentary, ""Closure""Boo-Hoo Closure doesn't have an official DVD release... yes, it was released somewhere in the latter 90s on VHS, but it is an amazing piece of work!  Not simply a documentation of the on stage performance but a collection of music videos and backstage, studio, and other candid footage.  This video comes from a time when NIN were in their hay day.  It's raw and gritty and dirty and really puts you there... look away from the HD hype and look back to the days of vintage film and analog recording.SECRET!  Search a torrent of Closure.  Due to some sort of legal troubles, it would seem as though Closure can never be officially released on DVD.

878139,"The majority of American Laurel & Hardy fans have first seen this feature in a grainy copy of a 55-minute American release that Blackhawk sold for years. When first released, the Hal Roach Studios was releasing alternate editions of their comedies to the foreign markets, usually in longer versions, with the stars themselves speaking the translated dialogue. Historians have found evidence of at least four or five variants of ""Pardon Us,"" including an extended version of ""Pardon Us"" that is the content of this DVD release. This appears to be the British release version with the American titles retained (in Britain this was ""Gaol Birds"").In terms of structure, longer is not necessarily better. The movie is still what Laurel called a ""3-story building on a 1-story foundation."" It seems like three short subjects strung together with an arbitrary climax tossed into the final 10 minutes to wrap things up. However, many scenes in this release are longer, particularly the middle sequence on the cotton farm. The added minutes help the individual scenes, relieving the choppiness that has always seemed characteristic of this feature. And while the cotton farm scene slows the feature to a halt, the singing of the Etude Ethiopian Chorus, coupled with Stan & Ollie's song and dance routines, are a pleasant diversion, in spite of the dated imagery.The overall pictoral quality on this release is about a 1000% improvement over the film prints I grew up with, but apart from the overall quality of the feature, for which I'm grateful, this disk is very lean. There are no chapter stops, no chapters of publicity material, no chapters of alternate scenes, some of which still exist. It would have been instructive to have the leaner American release on this or a second disk for sake of comparison. But like too many other American releases of Laurel & Hardy (and Little Rascals) comedies, we're getting the bare bones and little else.But for the Laurel & Hardy fan, this movie is essential viewing. I hope it sells well enough to give the copyright owners incentive to be more ambitious with future releases.",N/A

456031,"A rather simple and short film by a young director. In black and white of course because it is cheaper, but also because it is very classic in that kind of psychological thriller. Hitchcock did it with Psycho, why not Coppola then? Basically it is the guilt that develops and is cultivated in a family when some unacknowledged, unrecognized and unknown children's game turns sour, that is to say ends up with a dead child. The point is that the situation lacks originality and what's more the cause of the death is even trite, drowning. The most interesting part is the study of the mother as a family tyrant that imposes some kind of eternal remembering of the dead sister. That puts everyone on edge, on the defensive, hence on the side of hiding what should not be hidden because it creates a sick atmosphere that leads everyone to some kind of psychosis if not schizophrenia. Then the film has some shortcomings, such as the inheritance and the mother's will, or whatever that disavows the daughters in law who are treated as so many strangers. Then what is the deal with the first son, the one who has a heart condition? How long can it be hidden that he is not in New York but at the bottom of a lake?

1044331,"This 1985-86 Season DVD of this detective drama wasn't too shabby, but Universal should display the information of each episode of MAGNUM's original air-date along with a brief description of what the episode is about along with it's original air-date, just like they did with MAGNUM, P.I.-Seasons 1, 2, and 3, before showing each episode like Universal used to do with all their shows before showing the episode or at least put the original air-date on the DVD case with each summary listed with the episodes like Warnes Bros. did with the CHiPs Seasons 1 and 2 DVD's and like Warner Bros. did with all THE DUKES OF HAZZARD DVD's.For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1985-1986 Season episodes on CBS were9/26/85-DEJA VU10/3/85-OLD ACQUAINTANCE10/10/85-THE KONA WINDS10/17/85-THE HOTEL DICK10/24/85-ROUND & AROUND10/31/85-GOING HOME11/7/85-PANIOLO11/14/85-THE TREASURE OF KALANIOUPU'U11/21/85-BLOOD & HONOR11/28/85-RAPTURE1/2/86-I NEVER WANTED TO GO TO FRANCE ANYWAY1/9/86-SUMMER SCHOOL1/23/86-MAD DOGS & ENGLISHMEN1/30/86-ALL THIEVES ON DECK2/13/86-THIS ISLAND ISN'T BIG ENOUGH2/20/86-WAY OF THE STALKING HORSE3/13/86-FIND ME A RAINBOW3/20/86-WHO IS THIS DON LUIS HIGGINS & WHY IS HE DOING THESE TERRIBLE THINGS TO ME?4/3/86-A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK, A LITTLE BIT OF GRIEF4/10/86-PHOTO PLAYThey should also do that with AIRWOLF-Season 3 and THE ROCKFORD FILES-Season 4 and ROCKFORD FILES-Season 5 as well as ROCKFORD FILES-Season 6.But other than that MAGNUM'S 6th Season wasn't too shabby, especially since all the episodes were complete & uncut just like they were originally shown on CBS as opposed to how they were shown in reruns on COZY-TV, A&E;, USA, and WGN which were all edited with deleted scenes & added commercials, but the 7th and 8th Seasons of MAGNUM, PI are actually quite a bit better than the Sixth Season, since the 7th and 8th Seasons were quite a bit more sophisticated than the 6th Season, but some of my favorite episodes from the Sixth Season were ""Round & Around"", ""Way Of The Stalking Horse"", ""Paniolo"", ""Kona Winds"", ""Summer School"", etc., since those were some action packed and dramatic episodes that made Magnum a real hero at the end of each of those episodes, which I think most MAGNUM viewers and fans would agree with me on, even though the 1985-86 Season wasn't as good as the last 2 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. and even though the 6th Season wasn't as funny or as amusing as the first 2 seasons of MAGNUM either, since Magnum and the rest of the cast crew seemed to have become quite a bit more serious and more dramatic in this season.This was also the season when Magnum and Higgins get to meet Robin Masters so-called out-of-control nephew R.J. Masters(Tate Donovan) in the ""Summer School"" episode when RJ ends up impersonating Magnum and stealing his murder investigation to gain acknowledgement and respect along with driving a green Ferrari similar to Robin Masters red Ferrari that Magnum always drove.Something else I noticed about the last 3 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I., starting with the Sixth Season was Robin Masters Ferrari was actually newer and more upgraded than it was in the first 5 seasons of MAGNUM, since Robin's Ferrari had the black vents on the hood of the car and had snazzier rims in the 6th, 7th, and 8th Season of MAGNUM, which Robin's Ferrari didn't have in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th Season, which you'd notice if you take a very good look at Robin's Ferrari in the last 3 seasons of MAGNUM and then take a very close look at Robin's Ferrari in the first 5 seasons of MAGNUM all over again, which was especially noticable in the first 3 seasons, since those were the seasons when Magnum(Tom Selleck) drove the Ferrari more along with the fact that MAGNUM, PI was obviously no longer in its honeymoon phase of the show anymore either since the honeymoon phase of this private detective drama was already long gone by MAGNUM's 3rd Season.I'm just surprised that Robin's Ferrari never had a carphone in it, unlike THE A-TEAM van, THE FALL GUY's truck, and Face's Corvette all had, especially since Robin's Ferrari was quite a bit more upgraded than all those vehicles.It was also interesting seeing Clu Gulager in the ""Way Of The Stalking Horse"" episode after seeing him on other popular prime time shows like CHiPs, THE FALL GUY, KNIGHT RIDER, AIRWOLF, etc. prior to that.This MAGNUM, PI-Season Six DVD also includes a cool bonus episode from MAGNUM's Seventh Season such as ""The Little Girl Who"" episode, which my wife and I enjoyed watching, especially since MAGNUM's 1986-87 Season didn't get released till 8 months later after this DVD box set was.MAGNUM's 1985-1986 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""CBS: We've Got The Touch"", since that was CBS's slogan from the Fall of 1983 thru the Summer of 1986.In addition, MAGNUM's 6th Season was also MAGNUM's last season being on CBS's Thursday night line-up, since CBS had moved MAGNUM to Wednesdays in the Fall of 1986.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Meredith Mac Rae in the ""Summer School"" episode after her co-starring days as Billy Jo Bradley on PETTICOAT JUNCTION and BEVERLY HILLBILLIES*Alan Hale in the ""All Thieves On Deck"" episode after his co-starring days as Skipper on GILLIGAN'S ISLAND-Douglas McClure in the ""Paniolo"" episode before his co-starring days as Mayor Applegate on OUT OF THIS WORLD*Phyllis Davis in ""The Hotel Dick"" episode after her co-starring days on VEGAS*Henry Darrow in the ""Paniolo"" episode during his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL*Gran Van-Dusen in ""The Hotel Dick"" episode before his co-starring days on PORT CHARLES and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS*Eddie Barth in the ""Rapture"" episode after his co-starring days as Rick & AJ Simon's retired private-eye buddy(Myron Fowler) on SIMON & SIMONSo now that Universal has released all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. out on DVD, I'm hoping this has inspired Warner Bros. to finally release the detective drama MATT HOUSTON out on DVD soon, especially since MATT HOUSTON was also a very popular TV show during it's 3-year run on ABC, which by the way was in competition with MAGNUM, since Matlock Houston(Lee Horseley) was a private investigator just like Thomas Magnum(Tom Selleck) was along with the fact that MATT HOUSTON was MAGNUM, PI's biggest rival, despite the intriguing fact that there was an interesting slight resemblence between Magnum and Houston, except Houston was a lot tougher, a lot huskier, a lot spunkier, a lot more organized, and a lot more fortunate than Magnum ever was since Houston was a filthy-rich private-eye from Texas who lived in the L.A. Area to take over a family-business overseas who ran a private detective agency on the side as a hobby, but Magnum was just a beach-bum style private dick who lived on a shoe-string budget and rent-free at the so-called wealthy novelist Robin Masters Estate in Hawaii who only worked when he wanted to.Therefore Magnum(Tom Selleck) was always broke and Houston(Lee Horsley) never was since Houston lived high on the hog in a fancy shmancy penthouse in Hollywood who also had a detective agency in Downtown LA along with the fact that Houston was always rolling in bucks living in luxury and always had foxy women around him, unlike Magnum whose cash-flow problem was often a laugh since Magnum was always barely getting by and struggling to make a living just like the often festidious gumshoe Jim Rockford(James Garner)was on THE ROCKFORD FILES, so Magnum could never even touch Houston for that matter either especially since Houston lived the kind of lifestyle that Magnum envied & would've wished he could've had too, despite the fact that MATT HOUSTON tanked after it's 3-year run on ABC when it was cancelled in the Summer of 1985 since MATT HOUSTON lost a lot of viewers thru MIAMI VICE when it debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1984 since MIAMI VICE was at the same time 10PM time-slot as MATT HOUSTON was.By the way I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 out on DVD on March 9th, 2010 and SIMON & SIMON will be released on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are both now available for pre-order online, so I can hardly wait to add MATT HOUSTON DVD's to my collection along with my MAGNUM DVD box sets.",N/A
700530,"This is a typical 80's romantic comedy. It is very formulaic yet it still manages to be fun. I love looking back on these films because I grew up with these movies, clothes, songs, and culture.If you love the 80s then you should see this movie. It is better than several other options. However, it is not the best option. I think ""Say Anything"" is my favorite. I am partial to John Cusack.The acting, story, and overall feel of the movie is fine. One of the other reviewers mentioned that some actors went on to huge careers and it shows in some scenes. However, some show their inexperience.So if you love the 80s you should see this film; if not rent ""Say Anything"" because every one should see this movie once.",N/A
1066488,"One of the characters in ""The Good German"" remarks that the best champagne has the smallest bubbles. The film unfortunately, has a few big bubbles that impress initially, but vaporize and leave a flat, bitter fluid later.The big bubbles are the name actors and homage to film noir. The overweaning style, heightened by the best component of the film (Thomas Newman's music) is intriguing to lovers of the genre, but the actors, professional as they are, can't bring much to their roles, probably as a result of the direction. Clooney is likeable as always but doesn't project the necessary intensity of caring for Cate Blanchett that the action demands. Blanchett does create a character, but it's too Dietrich-like to stand in its own right. So, after the plot ends and the actors leave the screen, you're left with disappointment, even though your hopes were up and you were saying to yourself, ""This film isn't as bad as they were claiming!""The bottom line for me is: the real comparison film is Lars Von Trier's ""Zentropa"" (or ""Europa"") of 1991. That film has 10 times more noir techniques of interest, and a stronger symbolic element that makes the necessity of characterization less important. For me it is one of the greatest films ever made, something for which Soderberg was striving, but didn't have the talent to bring off.""Zentropa"" has trillions of little bubbles in the details. The best!",The Good German
191794,"I also wrote a review today explaining the sequence of ""Dead Man's Walk"",""Lonesome Dove"" and ""The Streets of Laredo"".In this epic we are in the 1890's as the end of the Wild West is approaching.The buffalo are pretty much gone,the Indians are pretty well defeated,the railroads are pushing through,the towns are getting civilized,the ranches are developing.The Lawmen we knew so well after the Civil War ,up to and including the 1880' are ,either dead,married and settled down and now in their 60's or 70's.In this epic we have McMurtry at his best giving us great characters and then played by outstanding and well known actors. In my opinion ,I think the actors and their acting is the best of the three movies.The storyline is excellent and one fast action scene follows another;but in the end we see we are winnessing the end of a era. It's hard to believe that most or the things that happened in the Wild West;took place primarily after the Civil War and the end of the century;a relatively short period of only 35 years.As we listen to the many versions and verses of ""The Streets of Laredo"" or as it's often called,""The Cowboy's Lament"" we are reminded of these days of Saloons with bat wing doors,boot hill cemetaries,shootouts,painted doves,hangings,plain pine coffins standing outside the Undertaker's parlour,bank holdups,stagecoach and railroad robberies and the faithful local Marshal, Sheriff orTexas Ranger,trying to maintain peace and justice.This novel is reflected in this verse from one of the versions of ""The Streets of Laredo""Oh,his eyes were fast glazing,and death was approaching,His white lips were curled and tourtured with pain;As he spoke in a wisper of a scene far behind him,Of his home in the East which he'd ne'er see again.""",N/A

311315,"The Maysles' brothers had film rolling in 1969 on the Rolling Stones' American tour and we are left with a little snapshot of time, a window to the groaning disillusioned close to the hippie counterculture.I had high hopes with ""The Rolling Stones--Gimme Shelter,"" as most reviewers touted it as one of the greatest statements on Rock and Roll and certainly one of the best music films around.  After watching it, I'm not sure that I'd agree.  If you are a Stones'-Head, I can certainly see the allure.  I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan myself and I admit a similarly subjected documentary made about that band would leave me pulling out my wallet dialing up Amazon and making an advance purchase.  So if you fall into the category of ascribing to Mick, Keith, and the boys rock and roll demagogy, well, you probably are convinced that ""Gimme Shelter,"" is the greatest thing since sliced toast.  The movie is fragmented.  At the beginning we get this ringside seat of the Stones' tour, music-making, and dare I say, boring goings-on.  Yes, the Rolling Stones, one of the 60's, 70's, and 80's more storied wild rock n roll band...boring.  This documentary actually captures the band as such until Altamont that is.  At Altamont the documentary takes a turn and things get interesting.Wherever you are with the 60's counterculture free-love, free-spirit debate as to the value of its role on our cultural development, this documentary seems to come across tangentially as a statement on all that.  The boomers, the generation, that fervently stood up for world peace, free-love, communal living, getting together had some wonderful idealistic ideas.  So, famous boomers, the generation that produced both Bill Clinton and George Bush, Jr., also include Mick Jagger and Keith Richards...not to mention dear Charlie Watts.  Altamont though sees the counterculture exposed.  The bookend of the big festivals, Woodstock and Altamont are pretty diametrically opposed.  One worked and one tragically didn't.What we get from ""Gimme Shelter,"" is a statement that along with an idealistic approach to life needs to accompany a healthy dose of responsibility, accountability, and the need for organization.  You can't say you have general good-will towards humanity without taking responsible action to ensure that the human condition exists in a safe semi-ordered world.  That is reading entirely too much into ""Gimme Shelter,"" I know but as the concert organizers go through the parking plan of trying to accommodate tens of thousands of cars in space that won't accommodate all those cars, we get a window on an enlightened and funny scene.  One of the concert organizers at the event is trying to help with the parking situation and eventually just says...yeah man we are letting them park wherever, it's kind of like an experiment.  Hah...an experiment which leads into a far more serious 'experiment' the California Hell's Angels being in charge of security.The stage becomes unsafe as people press in from all sides on The Burrito Brothers, Jefferson Airplane, and the Stones.  Jefferson Airplane's lead singer even gets beat up by the Hells Angels, yeah that's right, the guys hired to protect them.  The Grateful Dead refuses to go on (smart guy that Jerry Garcia) and we eventually get to the chaos that kills a man, Meredith Hunter.  Mick tries to take some responsibility and attempts to lead the crowd and the Angels in a ""let's get together,"" plea reminiscent of Rodney King's ""can't we all just get along.""  So we see the band's reaction to reviewing the concert footage and can actually see the Hell's Angels' knife-welding member slashing down on Hunter and Jagger walks away numb.  Incredulously music is played after the incident and the show goes on.  There has been no solution really to the masses going haywire at Rock-N-Roll concerts...from the Who's stampede to PJ's Roskilde...safety and security in the midst of celebrations and in the midst of rock-n-roll rebellion is still an issue to be addressed.So on this MLK day 2007, there is nothing wrong with the concepts behind loving your fellow man, world peace, and all that 60's stuff.  MLK stood up for it and stood up for it with responsibility and accountability.  Altamont didn't have that.  Culturally, where are we going now in this time of GWOT and Brittney Spears?  The show must go on and the Stones still geriatrically rock.  The best rock-umentary of all times...Gimme Shelter...in my opinion probably not.  Check out ""Dig,"" for a really excellent updated statement on rock and roll.  If you are a fan of the Stones or just a fan of music history, watch Gimme Shelter.  If not I don't think you will get no satisfaction.--MMW",N/A

213789,"This was a difficult movie to watch but it was incredibly moving.  It's one of those movies that really makes you think, especially in the times that we are living in today.  This movie was made in 1983 but I could see it as a horrific remake looking at all the events that have happened between then and now.The movie follows a family & town that is dealing with the horrible aftermath of nuclear attacks on the United States.  When nuclear bombs go off, communication comes to a complete halt.  Throughout the movie you don't know what has happened to other people in the country, who attacked them, or if there is anyone out there who will be able to pull everything back together.  It really makes you think about the 'what if?' question and what the world would do if something like this took place.  Looking at this movie, it doesn't look like there would be much hope for anyone.Testament is an incredible story but it is NOT for children or anyone looking for a happy ending or happy movie.  It is based on a book that was written and is very similar to a book in the way that the movie progresses.The acting was excellent and the story very well written.  I gave it four stars because there were a few things that I didn't like (example: the mother's character and the priest's scene at the cemetery).  Overall though, an excellent movie that I highly recommend everyone watch.  It will leave you thinking for days after.",Testament VHS

495716,"While it may be assumed that those looking to buy a box set of James Bond films have already seen them all and formed a favorable opinion of them, that's not necessarily true. For instance, I had previously seen none of these, but had seen enough other Bond films to want to acquire them all and so I started with this set.Like several other reviewers, I was at first annoyed that they were not presented in chronological order. But then, the rightful profit motive of Eon Productions is immediately transparent. If they had been issued in chronological order, then those who preferred one Bond over another might be likely to buy only the set with their favorite in them. By presenting them in seemingly random order, Bond fans will have to get them all. Beyond thirst for profit, Eon Productions has done the fan a favor. The Ultimate Edition series is truly a smorgasbord for Bond fans. In order for the fan to get his money's worth, he will be forced to reevaluate his original opinion of a Bond film by having to watch it a second time. If the viewer follows the sequence of the random order, he can then usefully compare and contrast the films either to reaffirm his old view or form a new one altogether.I like all the films in this set to varying degrees. Some of them sometimes rely too much on gadgetry and loads of sexual innuendo to carry them, but they all do what they are supposed to do: entertain. While Goldfinger is often cited by critics as the benchmark by which all other Bond films are to be judged, its not my favorite here. Here's my list of favorites from most to least:1) The Living Daylights: That surprised me because Timothy Dalton is far less famous as James Bond than any except perhaps George Lazenby. Great action, exotic locales, obligitory evil villains and a luscious Maryam D'Abo as Bond's latest love interest. The scenes in Afghanistan are of topical interest because we are now there instead of the Russians. My favorite action sequence is the thrilling chase of Bond and defecting cellist Kara Milovy (D'Abo) through the snow by Czech troops and their subsequent escape into Austria from Czechoslovakia. Next I enjoyed Bond's thrilling fight with his nemesis while clinging to a cargo net dangling precariously from a plane flying high over the Afghan desert. The fight scene in the truck as it careens down a narrow mountain road on Gibraltar is no slouch, either. This one is an under-rated gem.2)The Man With the Golden Gun: Good story and acting although the martial arts scenes were somewhat cartoonish. Roger Moore makes an excellent Bond here and Christopher Lee as Francisco Scaramanga is delightfully wicked. I was surprised that to see that Scaramanga is not actually played by an Italian, because in the film his character has very classically Italian features. Britt Ekland as Goodnight is attractive, but her character is ditzy and often ""dumb blonde"". Even when she does something right, she somehow screws up. My favorite scene is the chase through the canals of Bangkok followed by the frantic effort to escape Scaramanga's disintegrating hideaway before it detonates.Herve Villechaize adds much to the menace of the film with his cunning portrayal of the not-so-loyal Scaramanga flunkey Nick Nack.3)Diamonds Are Forever: Sean Connery is back as Bond and in top form. Its another good but improbable story. The film is filled with appropriately evil villains who have the wits to nearly match those of Bond, another beauty in Jill St John, and more silly names to snicker at: Blofeld and Plenty O'Toole. My favorite scene is the moonbuggy chase through the desert followed closely by the scene in the mortuary where Bond was nearly cremated. Plenty of gags, a couple of wise-cracking gay assassins and sly innuendo will keep you laughing.4)Goldfinger: Here's an early look at Sean Connery as Bond. Suave, debonair, a real ladies man yet ever ready to meet danger. Bond insinuates himself into the affairs of super-tycoon Auric Goldfinger and just happens to overhear the name of his masterplan. What that plan entailed, Bond was soon to find out, and what follows is a non-stop sequence of action-packed thrills. There are plenty of interesting gadgets though fewer here than in some of the later films. There are the silly names Auric (=AU=gold) and Pussy Galore which though likely tittilating at the time of the film's release now sounds lame. My favorite scene is the climax of the film when the battle is on for Fort Knox. Auric Goldfinger's plot comes close to succeeding, but you know it won't.5)The World Is Not Enough: A very improbable story line, but not impossible. The film has great topical appeal even today considering on-going oil supply worries. There is action aplenty, of course. I like the helicopters that use huge saws to cut through every obstacle. The best scenes are the early ski chase and then the later battle on the ramshackle oil piers of the Caspian Sea. Villains abound and who is friend or foe not always clear. And of course, Bond always gets the girl(s) one way or the other.The biggest question to ask yourself before buying the set is ""will I get my money's worth?"". The answer to that is a resounding yes. Even if you don't like one of the films, Eon Productions gives you added incentive to buy the set by adding discs filled with extras for each of the movies. This is one instance when you are better off buying the box set rather than each movie individually. Now that I've thoroughly enjoyed the James Bond Ultimate Edition-Volume 1, its on to Volume 2!",N/A

'Stay' is a mind-bending, emotional roller-coaster of a film that is similar in fashion to 'The Machinist' and 'Vanilla Sky' although not nearly as dark as the former. It is one of those pyschological films where you think you know what is going on-although it is deliberately convoluted to keep you guessing-until you get to the ending and then everything is flipped on it's head. McGregor and Gosling are both remarkable in their roles and I found myself emotionally and mentally drained at the ending.

The story shows how Yuanjia rises to power and his life story.  A couple of parts the dialogue are kind of confusing and you get the sense that something is probably lost in translation with the subtitles. The cinematography, storyline and acting are good.  I liked the historical parts of the movie and showing how Chinese people when they were being colonized by the British. The Chinese and Japanese comradery and mutual respect was nice also. The action/fight sequences are great.  This film is loosely based on the actual Huo Yuanjia's life, there were parts of the actual Yuanjia's life which were shrowded in mystery because of the time period that he lived in. I watched some of the extra features and they were saying that this will be Jet Li's last film and he will retire.

646113,"I almost didn't watch this movie, but it ended up being the only one available at the time. Having watched it and read other reviews here I have come to one conclusion.The questionable death of George Reeves was given a finer moment than the horrendous murder of the Black Dahlia in the two recent films.My expectations of The Black Dahlia were dashed away early in the movie. But this movie is much better. The filming itself, costumes, sets and dialogue were done quite well.The acting is all stellar. Diane Lane again proves herself as a lasting force here. Adrian Brody does very well as the detective and Ben Affleck is suprisingly star quality as George Reeves. The understated Bob Hoskins is once again excellent.Drawn from true events, this film pulls a lot of peripheral events and tries to pull together pieces of the puzzle of Reeves suicide. Was it really murder? The film offers a few different thoughts on the idea and portrays them well enough to each be considered a possibility.What the film tried to do, which I feel it failed, was to show personal anguish of the detective investigating the death. All it really did was to distract. Personally I think those parts could have been deleted.What this movie did show was the sordid lives of the glamourous people of the 50's. The lies, coverups and affairs all exposed. It left out the duality of actors/acting, which I thought was good. After all, this was to focus on real life events.All in all this movie is definitely worth a look. It has more character and compelling story than others of it's kind. The acting, scripts, costumes and sets are all very well done. You won't be disappointed if you like film noir.",N/A

On this show, Alain Swan (Peter O'Toole) a legend, comparable to swashbuckler Errol Flynn (of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD), is to make an appearance on the variety program.  The problem?

Enter Benji (a very young Mark Lynn-Baker), the studio peon, who has been delegated as Swan's assistant and babysitter.  He is to make sure that Swan doesn't get into too much trouble, and that he stays dry upon going on the air with the rest of the cast.  As a side note, Swan is also a notorious womanizer. Is there any possiblity that this man can even be controlled?  Well, you'll have to watch the film and find out for yourself.Peter O'Toole received a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for this role, and I really think he should have won.  This film is very funny and entertaining.",N/A

1048313,"... and it's not only the Bond of this film which is shaken, but the entire franchise.Fans of the James Bond films have reacted with vituperative insults, slamming the film and (as Daniel Craig mentions in the special effects DVD of the 2-DVD set) sending scathing and vicious hate-mail to the new Bond. I can see why - many watchers of the James Bond films have a very specific idea of what they want in a Bond film, and it's often NOT a case of knowing the books and wanting the films to be faithful to that. How could it be, after all? From Roger Moore onwards, there does seem to have been quite a noticeable swing towards the concept of making James Bond almost a spoof of himself.This film is actually truer to the books than the earlier films were.The ""traditional"" James Bond (by which I mean the Bond many viewers today expect, based on the Bond films, especially on the more recent ones) is then not really the ""real"" Bond whom Ian Fleming created.I can't pretend to be an avid Bond fan - I'm not. But I've enjoyed pretty much anything that Sean Connery has done, and I feel that Connery did a superb job of creating a ruthless, hard character who was in many ways a sexual predator, a dysfunctional being, but one who was brilliantly unstoppable as a secret agent, and blazing with intelligence, sexual power and suave charm. Roger Moore's Bond was too reminiscent (in my opinion) of Simon Templar, the Saint (a role which I think suited him much better than Bond). And so on... I felt the recent Bonds had wonderful potential, but were hampered by increasingly silly plots and overwhelmed by gadgets. Yes, we all love the spoofiness of all of those gadgets, but they were already too much over the top - they could no longer be taken seriously. Ditto for the villains - they were caricatures rather than serious characters, and because of that, they failed (in my opinion) to present a real source of tension in the films.I'd heard that this film - Casino Royale - was a break in the tradition. I'd admired Daniel Craig's acting in Munich, and thought that this was a Bond film worth watching...... and in my opinion this is a very interesting film, well acted, well scripted, well directed. The film achieved what those involved wanted to achieve - this Bond is a harder, quite brutal Bond without the experience of the later Bonds (because he only gains his double-oh status in the beginning of this film), but still self-aware and with a disarming self-knowledge that has him able to laugh about himself. I found myself believing in this Bond, and that is not something I can say of previous Bonds (except for Sean Connery, but then... Sean Connery, after all... what more need I say?).I think those who want Bond films to have a spoof-like quality with amazing gadgets and unbelievable and over-the-top villains will probably not like this film. For those who want an intelligent and intricate action/thriller, the film will probably please. Daniel Craig is of course an extremely good actor, and he has the right face for this sort of hard-edged role. He is able to express so much just with the look of his eyes and the tiny movement of muscles around the mouth - he does most of his acting with his face. But his physicality comes in very useful here too, in some of the most realistic fight scenes (and a taxing torture scene) that have made it to the screen.The various villains are believably played, and Le Chiffre is particularly well done. Le Chiffre is the sort of villain that previous Bond films would have overplayed.The women are of course all ravishing, and as Vesper Lynd, Eva Green does a good job of creating an initially armoured woman with her own secrets.Unlike many, I very much enjoyed the intricacy of the card game - it's a hard thing to shoot, and it worked for me.There are several quite breathtaking extended chase scenes or fight scenes, and I don't think I'll forget the fight scene on the steel girder, the car chase where Bond's car rolls seven times, and (ouch) the scene in a cellar where Le Chiffre uses a rope on Bond to illustrate how elaborate gadgetry for torture is completely unnecessary.I give this film 5 stars for being successful in its genre. I don't think it's a film without flaws, but the successful tension, exciting look and good acting throughout make it work.",N/A

1017719,"Eddie Cantor's KID BOOTS (1923) is one of the rarest films in my DVD collection.  It has been lost for eighty years and makes its home video debut now from an independent DVD company called Big House.  The 60 minute print is quite good--it may be the only copy in existence.  Cantor is an unwilling witness to a not-yet divorce that involves a large amount of money if the couple can reconcile.  This fast and fun movie co-stars Clara Bow and Billie Dove.  On a separate sound short, Eddie recalls how Clara taught him to tone down his vaudeville personality and he taught her how to be funny.Speaking of which, there are another hour of priceless shorts on this DVD besides KID BOOTS.  They include a 1929 sound short, filmed at Astoria Studios on Long Island, showing us Cantor's blackface song and joke routine as done on the New Amsterdam Theatre roof at midnight. This is the only print in existence and was just recently found in a New Jersey garage. We also get a 1924 Lee deForest Phonofilm sound short with Eddie doing his Ziegfeld routine, without the blackface.  We get a few jokes and a couple of songs in a truly nostalgic short.The whole DVD is a must-own curio for Eddie Cantor and Florenz Ziegfeld fans, and it includes regular mail and e-mail addresses for the Eddie Cantor Appreciation Society.  A certain older audience will truly cherish this precious Jazz Age DVD.  You know who you are.",N/A
148251,"The MovieNevermind the pop culture boogie man the character became. The only superb film in the series was the first good horror/thriller in decades. It did this not by shedding the humanity of it's characters, but drenching them in it. The streamlined script (relying on exposition by showing memory in action rather than the usual talking head, for example, Clarices memories of her father), the superior direction and inventive cinematography steeped the film in tragedy, doom and suspense. The casting was perfect. All surrounded by institutional squalor and the flipside of the american dream.The DiscFinally we get the extras we deserve. I already have the Criterion Edition with it's interesting commentary track and more key players than you can shake a script at...well, all of them actually. Too bad they couldn't have combined the two discs for those who don't have the Criterion.

296739,"Night and Day is probably the worst of the reverential ""biographies"" of America's great theater composers which Hollywood cranked out in the Forties. Rodgers & Hart, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, the list goes on, were all smoothed out, glossed over, given awful dialogue and had to see their songs so over-produced at times it must have seemed that they were hearing the heavenly choir.Night and Day gives us a number of Cole Porter songs polished and massaged with the lush sound stage treatment. The movie also gives the songs pretentious orchestrations so foreign to Porter's style, plus bowdlerized and rewritten lyrics to insure little of Porter's naughtiness would survive to possibly offend middle America.Most surrealistically, we have Cary Grant as Cole Porter...and that is the kind of casting that makes the Hollywood studio system so wonderful to read about. In addition to being one of the great theater composers, Porter was short, enthusiastically gay, a bit pop-eyed and a terrible social snob. On the other hand, he was supposed to have had a great sense of humor, and reportedly was highly amused when Cary Grant was chosen to portray him. (Another odd bit of Hollywood casting was choosing Mickey Rooney to play Lorenz Hart in Words and Music.)One or two good biographies have been written about Porter. As a film biography, though, Night and Day is largely a work of hack Hollywood fiction. But don't we at least get a bunch of his songs? Sadly, the songs have been so over-produced, treated so respectfully and have been so sanitized, that watching the numbers often is just downright irritating.Porter, such a social snob and living the kind of high-maintenance life some might consider simply frivolous, is worth knowing because of his songs...and his songs are best enjoyed when they are performed with impudence and style. It's smart to remember that when he wrote...I love youHums the April breeze.I love youEcho the hills.I love youThe golden dawn agreesAs once more she seesDaffodils.It's spring againAnd birds on the wing againStart to sing againThe old melody.I love you,That's the song of songsAnd it all belongsTo you and me....he wrote it to win a bet that he couldn't write a hit love song using mundane images. Porter won the bet and thoroughly enjoyed seeing what he consider a mediocre string of cliches become widely popular.  If you enjoy detective work as well as Cole Porter songs, track down the CD's produced by Ben Bagley, the Cole Porter Revisited series of albums. I think Porter might have enjoyed them. And there is also this essential book,The Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter",Night and Day VHS
66939,"This 1943 thriller from the master of suspense features Joseph Cotton as 'Uncle Charlie' and Teresa Wright as 'Young Charlie'. Cotten having made 'The Magnicent Ambersons' and 'Citizen Kane' with Orsen Welles in the previous two years was early in his career (Shadow of a Doubt was only his 5th film) proving to be a versatile and subtle actor.Arriving to visit his family in California, Uncle Charlie is very popular with all the family, especially 'Young Charlie'. Hitchcock of course is very clever and allows Joseph Cotten to drop a few hints of his posible sinister side. But maybe its a double bluff from the master of suspense. There are many trademark Hitchcock moments, a few lovely set pieces. In fact early in the film he uses a shot that would be recreated in Psycho 18 years later.The script is very good and the cast matches it most of the time with classy acting. Just occasionally I felt that the acting was a little wooden. I couldn't tell you where it happened, which is good because this means I'll have to watch the film again. The DVD has an interesting documentary about the making of the film with some of the surviving members of the cast.For me this wasn't as good as 'North By Northwest', Psycho, Rear Window or 'Strangers on a Train' but it is a very good film, and one that I have only seen once. I am sure that with repeated viewings it will improve each time and regardless of my opinion if Alfred Hitchcock liked above of all his other films it must be worth getting.",N/A
670857,"Ummmm... I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the people who are killing other humans and eating their flesh, genius.  Depending on your point of view, the above line either makes or breaks this film.  Were the filmmakers really trying to use this most heinous, exploitative, misogynistic, nauseating piece of cinema trash as a morality tale or were they intentionally being ironic?  Or perhaps they were pointing the finger at the kind of people who who enjoy this revolting piece of supposed entertainment.  ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is the kind of film that is cheered by folks who have spent hours of their lives on the internet looking for snuff films and videos of rapes.  What this film gives you is the most realistic over the top, uncalled-for phony snuff film ever made. The film is so graphic and realistically shot that the filmmakers were charged with murder and had to produce the film's actors in a court of law to exhonerate themselves of the charges.  This is a powerful, incredibly well made and original film that certainly inspired the ""Blair Witch Project"", but while ""Blair Witch"" managed to terrify by not showing you anything and letting the storytelling do it's job, ""Holocaust"" has a silly story and shows you EVERYTHING: genital mutilation, gang rape, forced abortions, more internal organs than you'd think could fit inside the human body and, of course, cannibalism.  And let us not forget the very real animal torture the viewer is forced to endure.  One furry jungle creature (incorrectly dubbed a ""muskrat"" by one character) is held up to the camera and carved up, writhing and screaming in pain, with a knife.  In another instance which almost caused me to vomit, a very large turtle is dragged out of the river and hacked apart with a hatchet, internal organs jiggling like so much gelatin and limbs still kicking.  There's also a shot of a monkey getting his face chopped off with a machette.  The real kicker there is that they messed up the first take and had to get another monkey to redo the shot.  I should also add that none of these sequences advance the plot in any way, they are there just to be ghoulish.  That's where the irony comes in; you see the theme of the film is about the impossibly unethical and downright disgusting ends the film's documentarians go to to get sensational shots for their film.  One could easily make the same claim about the folks behind ""Cannibal Holocaust"" regarding these authentic animal mutilations that we are forced to sit through as we view this movie.  So again I wonder if, by deliberately attempting to make this film a morality tale about how humans dehumanize each other, they were being ironic and putting one over on the idiots who would take that line about who the real cannibals are as some deep philosophical commentary on our society.  If so, bravo.  But I doubt that's the truth; I'm of the opinion that it was a lame attempt by the purveyors of this garbage to justify a film that only exists to be so utterly disturbing and vile that only those looking for the most hardcore gore they could find would ever even attempt to watch it.  I love gore and horror as much as anybody (hence my viewing of the film), but this film is waaaay over the line for me and unless watching a newborn pulled from its mother's womb and thrown into a hole and buried as the mother's head is smashed in with rocks or a woman being violated with a disturbingly large piece of wood and then killed is your idea of must-see TV, I can't recommend you ever come near this film.",N/A
994009,"Well, depending on your taste, ""The Web Planet"" is either vintage wine or soured vinegar. Opinion is dramatically divided on this one, and while I guess I'm in the ""vintage wine"" camp let me just make clear that I see where the detractors are coming from. I'm not sure how the special effects appeared to viewers in 1965, but age has not been kind to them and they look pretty fake today. Yes, I have to admit, when I first saw the Zarbi on the screen, I laughed despite myself--and this was by no means the last occasion I did so during this DVD. And the pacing is slow as snails by today's post-MTV standards and is bound to make the contemporary viewer feel at least a bit antsy.For me, the epic storyline and the ingenuous conceptualization of the insectoid inhabitants of the planet Vortis more than make up for these problems. Especially the latter. In the 1960's how revolutionary it must have been to have ""bug-eyed monsters"" as the good guys, but the writer (Bill Strutton) goes way beyond that, endowing the characters with plausibly alien mannerisms, thought patterns, and cultural traits in a way unmatched by much science fiction even today. This is especially so of the Menoptra with their poetically alien turns of phrase almost sung rather than spoken, their gracefully moth-like body language, and their religion of Light-worship along with the cocoon-like organic, weirdly expressionistic design of their temples. And then there's the unusual idiom of the grub-like Optra, which makes them seem convincingly non-human (even if the actors' costumes don't): for instance, coming to a barrier in an underground passage, their leader says ""A silent wall. We must make mouths in it with our weapons, then it will speak more light."" Fascinating, imaginative, and original--speculative in the best traditions of science fiction.Oh, and of course there's the Doctor. As usual, William Hartnell's rendition of the character is classic, and his long, tense battle of wits with the Animus is a high point of the story. Much of the suspense of the story lies here, in fact: how long can the Doctor con the villain into keeping him and his companions alive while not completely giving away the attack plan of the Menoptra ""cavalry"" (as it were). Hartnell pulls this off brilliantly, projecting stern resolve and intense intellectual agility with just a sparkle of mischief in his eye.For all of these reasons, ""The Web Planet"" transcends its limitations and succeeds as vintage TV sci-fi a la BBC. To help with the (now) slow pacing, I might suggest watching only one or two of the six episodes at a time instead of watching it all in one go. Like a fine wine, it must be savored slowly, not gulped down. As for the effects, sit down and watch this DVD in the right frame of mind, disbelief suitably suspended and with a willingness to see past to the great story and fascinating ideas beyond the surface. Doctor Who fans should be well used to doing this anyway--in this case they might just have to work a bit harder at it, that's all.",N/A
947593,"I bought ""Yesterday"" with no misgivings.  I understood that it was an Oscar-nominated film in the category of Best Foreign Language movie.  For me, that category holds lots of promise for a movie; one that is cinematically sound but little known in the US due to the language barrier.  ""Yesterday"" lived up to those anticipations.  It is a story of a woman who finds that she is infected with AIDS.  It gives a look at the social stigma as it was felt by her in her native South Africa.  It also gives a look at a person whose determination helps her to remain focussed while much around her crumbles.  In that sense it is a moving tale of courage mixed with a look at life in a rural South African village and the challenges that adds to Yesterday's dilemna.The leading actress, Leleti Khumalo, has an infectuous smile that endears us to her from the start.  The entire cast was new to me and I confess that I was aprehensive when I saw that the movie was produced by HBO Films.  I was afraid to find a ""made for (cable) TV"" look about it.  I'm glad to say that my fears were relieved (However, I fully expected the film to close with an on-screen lecture about the ravaging effects of the spread of AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa...it didn't).  If the movie has any shortcomings then, for me, they lie in its' failure to more fully develop the community that Yesterday lives in.

Other reviewers have expertly detailed the contents of this set, so I'd like to take a moment to try and convince/convert those folks who may not know and love these things as much as I do. . .There has been, as long as I can recall, a misconception about Popeye cartoons.  I recently had this discussion with a good friend, who could not understand why I was so excited about this release.  She, like so many people, was raised on the color Popeye cartoons made in the 1960's.  ""They're all the same,"" she complained.  ""Popeye and Bluto fight over Olive Oyl, and Popeye eats spinach and beats up his rival.  Big deal.""  And you know something?  Based solely on the cartoons my friend had seen, she was right.  She knew nothing of these original black & white gems made by the Fleischers beginning in the early 1930's.  And while the voice of Popeye in most of those shorts is the same (Jack Mercer) as the later ones, that's where the similarities end.  The early 'toons are full of creative gags, ad-libs and boundless energy.  Plus, they have the inimitable Fleischer style, which can also be found in Betty Boop and, later, the first Superman cartoons.I hope that those of you who only know Popeye from the later, bland incarnations will check out this set.  Forget Poopdeck Pappy or Popeye's nephews (those these will eventually surface in the Fleischer versions); this is the REAL POPEYE in all his elastic, mumbling glory.Essential viewing for Popeye enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the early history of animated sound cartoons.P.S.

633854,"I found myself asking `what was he thinking' quite a bit during this film.  I remember when it was first released I was excited to see a family comedy that looked entertaining but `The Pacifier' truly proves to be anything but.  It's the true definition of clich&eacute;d corny antics with no real plot other than some washed up implausible, prefabricated, ridiculous, contrived storyline that grows old before it gets started.  I felt like I had seen this done before in every other ridiculously unauthentic family comedy yet each and every other time I feel it was done better.  The first and largest mistake was the casting of Vin Diesel as the lead.  He's not funny, not even in the whole tough guy gets schooled kinda way they tried for.  He doesn't land a single joke and his physical humor is nothing more than awkward and just plain painful to watch.  The second major mistake was the inclusion of Brad Garrett's character.  Not the fact that Garrett played him (although I find Garrett annoying and unfunny anyways) but his character as a whole, even played by someone else, was a total waste of script paper.The story follows Shane Wolfe, Navy S.E.A.L., as he's assigned to watch the children of a slain scientist while his widow is retrieving some valuable information from his safety deposit box in Switzerland.  In her absence Shane has to deal with intruders looking for some top secret disc or something like that.  Shane's biggest problem though is the children who don't want him there and fight him every step of the way.  Our biggest problem is the script that the actors muddle through and we have to try and find entertainment and or enjoyment in.  That is a hard job and one not worth fulfilling.Vin Diesel was at one time a Hollywood `it' guy.  He was in the big blockbusters of the season thanks to his pivotal role in `The Fast and the Furious'.  After that he was admired by all men and swooned over by all women.  But it's apparent that his career has taken a dive.  His choice in films lately has been anything but inspired or even smart.  Turning up in a film much better suited for washed up talents as apposed to rising stars goes to further twist the knife.  I can't really think of anything nice to say about this movie.  Granted, there are a few scenes, very few, that made me chuckle, like when Shane teaches the Girl Scout troop to fight and they get to try it out on some rival troopers, but it's not enough for me to say I'd consider watching this mess again.  It was nice to see Lauren Graham, but I say that only because she's very easy on my eyes.  In fact the ending alone is so outrageously ridiculous that I can't help but chastise this movie for trying to be taken seriously.  It's not funny unless you find cheap imitations utterly hilarious.",The Pacifier

I see people float around from one workplace to another after a short time. I feel that when the ""Yuppie"" was created that the days of the long-term relationships with employer and employee were severed, and therefore no chance of making friends with those we work with, and work became less-appealling. I feel that's what happened in this movie as I would see people getting jerked around not knowing whether they will have a job tomorrow, or not, and bowing to a corporate raider like he/she's God. Having to sell out all your values for cold hard cash, and flaunt it in front of everybody. Well this movie did that, but it also showed a person can change when he/she wants to. With the supporting character of Carter he plays opposite Dennis Quaid as Quaid's boss, and he climbed up the corporate ladder rather fast as he's only 26. He would get married, and then divorced in short order, and then he rebounds with Quaid's oldest daughter, and then loses her. Quaid in the meantime has done the job shuffle all throughout the movie. I see this as the workplace out of balance where those who are at the top make out all right, and those in the middle like Quaid and Carter take a risk of getting fired, or laid off. I see this as a movie that makes me not want to go to work, but do like Carter does at the end of the movie, and that's jogging on the beach; not sure whether he has a job, or not, but at least he's happy. I look back, and see that the conception of the ""Yuppie"" was done in 1981 when Reagan fired all the air traffic controllers at Eastern Airlines when they went on strike. This destroyed the union as a whole as it became easier for corporations to thrwart strikes, and keeping unions in check, and keeping workers uncertain about thier futures. I just hate the plots like this, but this was done rather well with the performances of Quaid, Scarrlett Johannsen as Quaid's eldest daughter, and Carter. I probably wouldn't watch this one again just because of the plot.",N/A

561579,I have had the chance to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVD.  This movie stays to it's wonderful action and great story.  Although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it.  Not having this movie on DVD helped make the purchase easier.  I have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which don't always go together.  Overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch.Now on the Blu Ray scale.  In many Blu Ray movies you either get two things.  A picture that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture.  I was disappointed when I made this my first blu ray movie.  I almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard.  Although after watching other movies I know better.  I don't believe they spent as much time as they should have transferring this movie over to hd.  That is generally the problem with some movies.  And for the price of Blu Ray players and the Blue Ray Discs you should only have the best picture.  So I only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the dvd version.,Gone in 60 Seconds

1052961,"I read Tom Perrotta's ""Little Children"", on which the film is based, right before seeing the film, and I think the translation to the screen suffers in the comparison. Had I not read the novel first, I suspect I would have given it four or five stars, as many reviewers here have done. But the novel is really much better -- and even though Tom Perrotta adapted his own novel for the screenplay, it just isn't as good.The acting, overall, is excellent. Kate Winslet is fantastic (as usual), as is Jackie Earle Haley. But Jennifer Connelly, though good, was somewhat underwhelming. Not that I blame her; she just wasn't given enough to do. Noah Emmerich and Patrick Wilson are also great, but not quite in Winslet and Haley's league.Turning to the film itself, I have to say that by far the weirdest, most distracting, and inexplicable choice is the narrative voice-over. Ugh. I don't know who to blame for this -- Tom Perotta (screenplay) or Todd Field (directing). But with only one or two exceptions, it just doesn't work -- at least, again, for those familiar with the novel.I will say that at many points, the direction and cinematography are very compelling. There's a particular sequence, designed to show the passage of time at the Town Pool over the course of the summer, that is just amazingly done. Those sorts of sequences are almost a clich&eacute; these days, but this one was fresh and visually interesting. Also, the -- ahem -- au naturel scenes between Sarah and Brad (Winslet and Wilson) are consistently framed in grey, recalling the dreary, rainy afternoon the first time they were intimate and reinforcing the ultimate emptiness of their relationship. This was a great touch.The ending of the film departs from that of the novel in a *major* way (which I will not spoil). I do have to say that in one, single respect (relating to the Ronnie McGorvey character), I think the film actually outdoes the novel. Perhaps Perotta decided he'd rather have done it differently? And it really works! But outside of that, the rest of the film's ending is anticlimactic, undramatic, and loses something very significant from the message delivered in the novel.Final verdict: pretty good (3 stars; but Amazon doesn't have  stars), but certainly not what it *might* have been, and not what I *hoped* for after reading the excellent novel on which it's based.",N/A
348587,"Except to one or two outright dismissals, the previous 44 Amazon reviews consist pretty much of raves.Let me be a contrarian and point out a few things that are less than stellar about this film.--The opening credits are cutesy enough to send some people into sugar shock.--The soundtrack is a disgrace.  Enrico Caruso warbling into large metal cones in 1905 was captured in higher fidelity than anything on this Criterion edition.  If the problem was in the original, Powell and Pressburger were using disgracefully sub-standard technology even for wartime Britain.  If the problem is with Criterion, then that outfit should have lived up to its prestigious reputation by either seeking out a better source or using the sort of technology that is routinely used to reveal remarkable fidelity in opera recordings made more than 80 years ago.--The musical score has been flattened to match the blandest English taste.  This is particularly apparent in the folk song that gives the movie its title.  The piece is sung at a dirge-like pace by a young girl of little talent who has obviously been told to make it as sweet sounding as possible.  The effect is something like Guy Lombardo playing ""Satisfaction.""  An actual Scottish choral group appears briefly in the big party scene.  For about five bars they are given a chance to let us know what decently trained voices singing at tempo can do with the music of the islands.  It is a pleasing but too brief respite.--There is a sub-plot, or rather a diversion involving a country twit of the huntin' and shootin' type and his hunting eagle.  This is so pointless that I suspect that Powell and Pressburger simply stumbled over a man at the shooting location who happened to have an eagle, so they wrote a part for the bird to display the landscape.--The central drama of a woman torn between two courses and two men is never established because the man Hiller's character has come to marry never appears.  He is heard only as a pompous voice on a radio receiver.  Hiller's dramatic conflict must simply be taken on faith.--The acting style is pure London West End stage stand-and-deliver.  Roger Livesey's acting technique consists of standing up very straight, remembering all his lines and delivering them in a relentless, affectless monotone.  (How much better the film would have been with an actor such as Robert Donat, who could actually act and offer a convincing Scottish accent, too!)  Wendy Hiller, more often than not demonstrates exactly how it was that she could be heard in the most distant seat in any theater.--The Hebridean scenery and weather are offered as things of romance and grandeur.  And I suppose they are, if you live in London or Nebraska.  I, on the other hand, live in a part of the world where the scenery is quite similar, except that the coasts of British Columbia and Alaska have mountains that are a LOT taller, the weather can be much worse, and we have trees.  I happen to agree with Dr. Johnson and Boswell who famously visited the very sites shown in the movie during the 18th Century.  They regarded them as cold, wet and gloomy.That said, I must now declare my nitpicking to be beside the point.  For all its many faults ""I Know Where I'm Going"" works.  I don't for a moment believe in Wendy Hiller's character but I still care for her.  Livesey is an absolute stick, but he's a curiously likeable stick.  I want to see them form a bond.  The gloomy scenery is more than the sum of its parts.  There is magic here, that inexpressible but unmistakable something that makes watching a film two hours well spent.  Down at the level of basic truth and underlying quality, all those uncritical rave reviews were perfectly right.This is a film well worth watching.ONE ADDITIONAL TRIFLING POINT: From time to time previous reviewers have referred to this as a film from 1947.  One of the additional features involves an interview with the woman who drove Wendy Hiller to the shooting sites every morning in the dark pre-dawn hours.  The trip down the narrow road was more than a little frightening because she could not turn on her headlights in the wartime blackout.  In point of fact, the film was shot in 1944 and released in December 1945, something that is specifically stated in the supporting material.",I Know Where I'm Going VHS

It pokes fun, in some cases more extreme than others, for our benefit.  If we're paying 8 and in some cases even 10 dollars to see a movie, we expect to see something hilarious!Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is raunchy, crass, and often the character Borat is racist and sexist, and yet it always makes you laugh.  While many laughs comes from Borat's statements and questions, many more come from the responses of the real life people involved, such as the scene where Borat asks a car dealer if he has a car good for running down gypsies.If you think it's not okay to make fun of anyone, you'll hate this movie.  And if you do, please don't trash it mindlessly.

Gilbert Roland (aka: Luis Antonio D'maso de Alonso)Birth Date: 12/11/1905 - Juarez, Chihuahua, MexicoDied: 5/15/1994 - Beverly Hills, California (cancer)Special footnote, actor Gilbert Roland first major role was as one of Clara Bow's love interests in the collegiate comedy ""The Plastic Age"" (1925). In 1927, he played Armand in Camille opposite Norma Talmadge, with whom he was romantically linked. He went to star opposite Talmadge in several more films but when sound ended her career, Roland's voice was well suited for the new medium and his career continued uninterrupted. He starred in several Spanish language adaptations of American films and continued as a romantic lead ... Beginning in the 1940s, Roland's roles became smaller but critics began to take notice of his acting and he was praised for his supporting roles in John Huston's ""We Were Strangers"" (1949), ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952), and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964). He also appeared in a series of films in the mid 40s as the popular character ""The Cisco Kid."" Catholic viewers probably know him best as Hugo, the agnostic (and totally fictional) friend of the three shepherd children in ""The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima"", which is based on the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima in 1917. His last appearance was in the 1982 western movie Barbarosa ... Roland died of cancer in 1994 at the age of 88. Roland was nominated twice for a Golden Globe Award, for his roles in ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952) and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964) ...

So it was with great reluctance that I bought my BlyRay player.  I bought about 20 DVDs right off the bat, most of them being the ones that were supposed to make the most of the format, including Fifth Element, 300, Planet Earth series, and the Pirates/Carribean series.  Now these movies did look and sound great, but I didn't think they warranted the huge upgrade in price.  Thankfully, Close Encounters came out and was SUPERB!  That was my fave until now.Blade Runner is the BEST BluRay transfer I have seen to date.  And by a huge margin.  In the first 10 minutes when you see that dark cityscape you'll be in awe.  When Batty and Sebastian cruise up to the pyramid, the detail of the pyramid is breath taking.As for the content, note that only the movie in all it's versions are bluray.  The discs with the extra content are NOT bluray even though they are included in the bluray set.  Not that they really need to be.The story of the FInal Cut?  Brilliant. I loved Blade Runner and at 39 was a product of the 80's.  I used my swingset for the Millenium Falcon.  I was immersed in the Sci Fi of the day.  Even at that young age I love Blade Runned.  But this new ""Final Cut"" version really isn't just another rehash.  It's far more mature and more dark than it's original release.  Most notable is the absence of Deckard's constant inner monolgue/narration of the film.  No ""driving into the sunset"" happy ending.So in conclusion, if you want a bluray disc that will really show off your system and amaze your friends, then Blade Runner is it.  If you're an avid fan of them film for years and are wondering if it's worth buying...yet again, then it most certainly is.  The quality is worth it alone, but the recut is actually very lovingly done.  All in all a true masterpeice of BluRay and it has raised the bar for what older movies can look like if they spend the time/money on them to make them look great.I can't recommend this particular title strong enough.",Blade Runner

In a quest to recover stolen drug money, evil incarnate (Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem) decimates anything in his way with almost supernatural power.  Bardem's mesmerizing portrayal immediately takes a place next to the quintessential evil men in film history, from Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter to Jack Palance's gunslinger Wilson from Shane.  Yes, he's that good.  In Chigurh's wake is left the bodies of his former colleagues and rivals and an endless string of seemingly good townsfolk who just happened to be in the wrong place when the evil winds came a-blowin'.Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is the object of Chigurh's pursuit. While hunting antelope, Moss discovers the drug money and soon realizes his great fortune comes tethered to an even greater price. The unrelenting, unstoppable Chigurh finds his way to all of Moss hiding spots, always armed with weaponry rivaling in creativity the arsenal of Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle. I'm far from a gun nut, but the two devices of death primarily used by Bardem in this film are flat out cool.The search for Moss and the ensuing body count plays out under the nose of Tommy Lee Jones' aging lawman, the film's conscious and analytic voice. As the man in the best position to save the innocent (and not so innocent) from Bardem's monster, Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell slowly realizes the futility of trying to stop evil. As an old friend and mentor tells him, wickedness has always and will always exist, and anyone who believes they can stop it falls victim to vanity.No Country for Old Men gives this seemingly nihilistic view to its audience, with an ending that will no doubt disappoint those expecting men in white horses to ride in and save the day. In fact, viewers expecting any kind of traditional ending (either good or bad) will find the ambiguous close of this film frustrating. Several people stayed in the theater through the credits when I watched it, as they almost demanded or even willed an additional scene to find its way to the reel.This difficult lack of closure, these frayed knots left untied shouldn't be the film's legacy. Up until the ending, No Country for Old Men gives its viewers a merciless edge-of-your-seat ride, full of some of the most unforgettable characters and scenes in years.  Its heightened sense of drama and tension is unmatched in anything since The Shining.  This film will cause you sleepless nights, as your only comfort will be knowing that you don't have a bag of Anton Chigurh's money, and he's not coming for you.",N/A

It's not scary, suspenseful, or interesting, nor does the story make a lick of sense. As a viewer, I felt cheated and insulted by the ham-handed way the filmmakers cobbled together a ""surprise"" ending.  The only reason it could be seen as a surprise is due to the fact that you wouldn't believe professional writers and filmmakers would attempt to provide such a ridiculous and implausible solution to their story. To make matters worse, I didn't like the way the picture was shot either; particularly the ""fantasy"" sequences, which I found jarringly annoying.

667762,"Director Shohei Imamura's film, ""The Eel,"" has one great asset: Actor Koji Yakusho. No matter what role Yakusho plays, or whether the film is average or below average, Yakusho's presence always takes the film a notch above what it would otherwise be. And the same goes for this film. The story begins in the year 1988. Takuro Yamashita (Koji Yakusho) has just received an anonymous letter detailing his wifes infidelity. He reads this letter while on the train to home. Greeted by his wife, he lets her know that he will be fishing as usual. However, this is just a pretense, as his jealous mind races with the thought of catching her in bed with another man. And eventually, in a fit of anger, he will take the life of his wife. Moreover, he will bicycle down to the police station to turn himself in. Later, when he is found guilty, he will spend the next 8 years of his life in prison. And his sole companion and friend? An eel.The films narrative begins after his release from prison. Upon his release after 8 years he is given the eel by the prison guards. As this has been the one and only true confidante Takuro trusts: a friend to whom Takuro even talks to. Placed on parole and under the ever watchful supervision of a Buddhist priest named Nakajima, Takuro purchases a barber shop: isolated and alone. And more importantly, away from everyone else--or so he thinks. He feels comfortable with just his pet eel as his companion. Yet, his nightmares of his past actions never leave him, as we are witness to his uncomfortable dreams that intrude with his sleep. Contrary to what he might think, he has much guilt over his past actions. I like the character of the priest Nakajima, who is the parole officer of Takuro. The priest berates Takuro, in a good way, for not feeling remorse over his wifes death, or that Takuro does not know where she is buried--as Takuro has never visited her grave.However, it is in this isolated region that Takuro will make contact with a woman who reminds him of his wife. Moreover, this woman will change his life for the better. Discovering a woman laying in the fields, he notifies his barbershop acquaintances and the police. The woman, Keiko (Misa Shimizu) has attempted suicide. And thus begins the start of Takuro's personal journey of redemption for his crime. Regardless of what Takuro may lead himself to believe, his guilt weighs heavily on his conscious. For example, when the young woman comes to work for him, at the suggestion of the priest, she cuts herself with a small cut on her finger. Racing on his bicycle with Keiko in tow, he peddles as if her life were in danger to reach the hospital clinic miles away. For it was a knife that Takuro murdered his wife with. He cannot escape his past.Keiko, like Takuro, also seems to be a lost soul. We see her her own hardship in small flashbacks, and understand that not only does she feel unworthy of another--but feels alone too! However, circumstances will place both of these two people together. And with this Takuro's own coming terms with the terrible crime he committed. Is he capable of redemption? Can he forgive himself? Can he come to terms with what he has done? More importantly, does he understand how terrible his crime was? He wonders to himself if there ever was an anonymous letter sent to him concerning his wife infidelity. And if so, what happened to the letter? His guilt weighs on him. He cannot carry on with his life until he comes to terms with what he has done. Are there second chances for those who commit horrible crimes? And can he come to terms with what he has done? There are parts of the film that I do not wish to spoil for you, where we see Takuro trying to come to terms with what he has done, and maybe even redeem himself. As for Keiko, has she found what she is looking for? This film is recommend with caution. It is not a film that will resonate with many viewers. Therefore, I recommend you rent it first.",N/A

395468,"Rocky III starring Sylvester StalloneSince I was a kid, I love to watch action movies.I often go to watch action movies - even though they may be deemed 'no-brainers' - with only two objectives in mind. One, to be entertained, & two, to learn something useful.Sylvester Stallone is one of my favourite action movie stars, despite the fact that he has drooping eyes, a crooked mouth & talks funny. I have watched many of his action movies, which included Rocky I to III, Rambo I (First Blood) to III, Judge Dredd, The Specialist, Demolition Man, Cliffhanger, Tango & Cash, Cobra & Nighthawks.I would like to single out one of his action movies, Rocky III, which I thought shares many valuable learning points in terms of life (survival) skills.The focus of the entire movie centres on his reluctant return (again as Rocky Balboa) to the ring after an earlier brutal knock-out & devastating defeat by Clubber Lang (played by Mr T), with the encouragement of Apollo Creed (played again by Carl Weathers). Rocky struggled through his fears & anguish as he kept playing the vivid images of past defeat in his mind.On the other hand, Apollo kept drumming into Rocky's thick skulls about the urgent need to regain his fighting spirit.It was very interesting to watch both of them & also to listen to their witty dialogue, as Rocky struggled to attain his former killer instinct, the eye of the tiger, while undergoing intensive re-training. Flashbacks of his failed encounter with Clubber Lang constanly kept Rocky awake at night. It was quite fun to watch Mr T in his meanest role as a wrecking machine in the ring.In one early training scene, Rocky was really exhausted & he wanted to stop: ""Let's do it tomorrow."" Apollo screamed: ""There's no tomorrow!""The scene at the beach & the subsequent dialogue between Rocky & his wife, Adrian (played by Talia Shire), was really touching & motivating.A very concerned Adrian asked one pertinent question: ""Why did you come here?"".Rocky began to reveal his inner fears & lingering doubts through his conversation with Adrian.The final revelation actually came from Rocky as he yelled: ""Nothing is real if you don't believe in who you are!""A lot of the times in our lives when we encounter stumbling blocks or setbacks in our path to seek out our fondest dreams, we often begin to lose steam & doubt ourselves. This often happen to kids & teens when they get an F in a test or may be just flunk school. Like Rocky, we keep playing the images of self-defeat in our minds & begin to lose the original focus & intended purpose at the beginning of the journey.The interview dialogue between Clubber Lang & the reporter was also witty but meaningful. When asked for his strategy to counter Rocky's comeback to the ring, his remarks were ""Don't need any!""When asked again by the reporter for his prediction, he retorted: ""Pain!""At the ring just before the fight, Clubber Lang said menacingly to Rocky: ""I'm going to bust you up!"" Rocky's immediate response: ""Go for it!""Putting these dialogues into a life-skill perspective, I am sure readers will concur with my following analyses:- If we don't have a strategy in life, pain is definitely what we will get.- The best way to deal with fear is to fight it! FEAR is just a FALSE EVENT APPEARING REAL!- Alway believe in ourself & in our ability to perform & succeed in the things we are working on. Believing that we can make it happen is an important step toward creating a desired future. Napoleon Hill, author of the 'Law of Success', rightly said that, it takes a person half their lives to discover that life is a do-it-yourself project.- In life, everything is possible; it's just a question of strategy!If you have not yet watched Rocky III, I strongly suggest you watch it quickly & carefully. You will learn hell a lot from this movie!All Mums & Dads out there, I strongly urge both of you to go & watch this movie with your kids & teens!",N/A

313501,"With the exception of the recent Billy Bob Thornton retelling of the tale, few epics have had quite as bad a press as John Wayne's The Alamo. If it is not the masterpiece Wayne set out to make, it is also certainly not the disaster it is often painted. Even financially the film eventually turned a very healthy profit, although the staggered nature of its roadshow release meant that it didn't do so quickly enough to save Wayne from having to sell his share in the picture he had invested so much in.Very much a personal crusade, he raised the $12m budget partially from a trio of Texas millionaires and from his own pocket. The set and surrounding village were actually built three years before shooting, ostensibly so that vegetation could grow naturally around it, though problems raising the budget seem more likely. Nonetheless, the film's much-trumpeted great pains to look authentic extends to the casting, enhanced by some of the great faces in the supporting cast, not least of them the irreplaceable Hank Worden, replacing Old Mose Harper's desire for a rockin' chair for 'the time to live and a place to die' in one of his best performances as the Parson. Laurence Harvey, a man reputedly in life as innately impossible to like as his character in The Manchurian Candidate, carries the dramatic element as Travis more than efficiently, while Wayne and Widmark give perfect demonstrations of fleshing out a part through star quality as Davey Crockett and Jim Bowie.Along with 55 Days at Peking, this was the biggest of the siege epics of the sixties (Zulu, Khartoum, The War Lord), recounting a somewhat romanticised version of the iconic battle that saw some 185 men hold off 7000 Mexican soldiers for thirteen days. Very much a populist epic, it is broadly entertaining but with a quiet dignity at its heart, and while there is sentiment, it is pure and honest enough not to seem desperately manipulative. Wayne's direction is a strong point, with a good visual eye that owes nothing to John Ford (who had less to do with the film than is commonly believed and nothing to do with the truly spectacular battle scenes) and a surprising generosity to friend and foe alike.There are many moments of pure visual poetry, too - a rider galloping through a stream, defeated Mexican troops reflected in a muddy pond while their women carry away the bodies of their loved ones and the astonishing finale where the screen is packed to bursting with thousands of extras. The cavalry sequences in particular are strikingly well handled, with a healthy respect for the horses (unlike many sixties epics, none were hurt or killed). True, it sure is a long time a-comin', but if there's a more spectacular battle scene on film this side of Bondarchuk's Waterloo, I've not seen it.Unfortunately, the DVD is something of a travesty. Facing personal bankruptcy, two weeks after the film opened Wayne asked his producer son Michael to cut the film to get in more shows to improve its cash flow - the film was popular, but at nearly three-and-a-half hours was limited to only two shows a day at a handful of theatres. No prizes for guessing which version MGM/UA have chosen to release. Although the uncut version was available on video and laser disc, the company's rationale for releasing the cut version to DVD was that since there were no foreign language soundtracks surviving for the uncut version and they were committed to releasing multiple-language versions, the cut version was preferable to subtitling the film for foreign languages. To add insult to injury, even the hour-long documentary produced for the laserdisc release has been cut back to 40 minutes to paper over any mention of the restored version!As a result, some half an hour of footage is now missing once again not much more than a decade after it was restored. Even the Overture, Intermission, Entr'acte and Exit Music from Dimitri Tiomkin's superb score have been lost. The only positive is that the widescreen transfer at least makes the most of Wayne and cinematographer William Clothier's careful Scope compositions - and films like this are what Scope is all about.As for what you're missing, much of the extra running time was taken up by slightly extended scenes, such as Travis' explaining why he knows ""I am better than that rabble"" that he commands, crucial to understanding his character. Nonetheless, there are several 'new' scenes, the more significant additions including: more of Bowie's opening scene and various bridging scenes enlarging on his conflict with Travis; the death of the profiteer Emil when he tries to stop Crockett taking the gunpowder from the church and a subsequent love scene between Crockett and Flacca; nearly a full reel after the Intermission where Bowie decides to leave the Alamo but is dissuaded by Patrick Wayne reluctantly lying about the number of reinforcements on their way; Scotty's patrol discovering the cattle and coming off badly at the hands of some pursuing Mexican Lancers and Dragoons; and the death of Parson and Crockett's quietly effective  prayer.Even if to some the film still felt too long at 203 minutes (and frankly, it do), none of these scenes should have been the ones to be cut, and their restoration helped the film flow more smoothly than the shorter version. Worse, it's not an isolated incident - MGM/UA meted out similar treatment to the restored version of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World] on DVD, while some other titles like The Dogs of War and F*I*S*T are available in two different cuts on either side of the Atlantic.The film's reputation may limit its appeal to Wayne's fans and the epic collector, but it's a fine film that deserves better treatment on DVD than it received.",N/A

1053987,"After watching the entire 5th season of ""Smallville"" and waiting through the long summer break before season 6 begins, I was definitely looking forward to another season of Clark Kent's epic journey on his way to becoming Earth's greatest hero, Superman. There were numerous reasons for my anxiousness regarding this new season, the inclusion of Green Arrow (a popular DC Comics character) and Jimmy Olsen held interesting promise, also the resolution to the Zod plotline that was put into motion in the final episodes of season 5, plus just seeing where the creative minds behind this show were going to take us over the course of this new season. But, with all of my excitement there was a small amount of fear, because during the summer the network that had been the home of ""Smallville"" for 5 years, the WB, merged with UPN to form the new network the CW. This merger put many shows in possible jeopardy, leaving many to wonder what shows from the two networks would survive to make it to the new season. Thankfully, when all was said and done, ""Smallville"" was among the numerous series' from the WB to make it through, and by the end of season 6 had proven itself to be one of the CW networks highest rated shows of the season (no big surprise there).""Smallville: Season 6"" begins exactly where the 5th season left off, with the Kryptonian villain Zod attempting to take over the world while residing in the body of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum). As if Zod's machinations weren't trouble enough, Metropolis is in the middle of deadly riots, Chloe (Allison Mack) is in considerable danger while trying to make her way to safety, Lana (Kristen Kruek) is standing by Lex's side, Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Lois (Erica Durance) awaken to find their plane about to crash, and the one man who has a chance of stopping the chaos, Clark (Tom Welling), is trapped in the Phantom Zone (Kryptonian prison for those who weren't aware). All of this is just in the first episode, throughout the season Clark must deal with his guilt over not being able to stop some of the devastation caused by Zod, while at the same time he discovers that his release from the Phantom Zone has brought some rather unexpected and nasty visitors with it. Lex is feeling somewhat remorseful over his part in the devastation that occurred in Metropolis, but his main concern is the continual manipulation of Lana as she gets closer and closer to him. Lois, however, gets to have some relief from the chaos of the first episode as she begins to fall for a new billionaire in town, Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), who just so happens to be the hero known as the Green Arrow, and his reason for being in town is to stop Lex's project 33.1, the construction of an army of super soldiers. Clark and Oliver become friends over time and aid each other in times of need and in their quests to stop Lex's evil schemes from coming to fruition. Along the way Clark and Oliver enlist the aid of some fellow heroes, that Clark has previously had run-ins with, to assist them in destroying one of Lex's most active 33.1 facilities. With all of these events in one season, and many more that I didn't touch on, you'd think that would be enough to keep Clark and company busy, but you'd be wrong, for at the end of the season a new deadly foe is unleashed who is similar to Clark, only a little more bizzare.""Smallville"" continues to get better and better with each passing season, and this 6th season is no exception. The story arcs for the season were very engrossing, especially the Oliver Queen/Green Arrow arc and the capturing of all the escaped Phantoms from the Phantom Zone. The writers for this series continue to faithfully capture the essence of all the established DC Comics characters that have been on the show all along or have been introduced along the way.The cast for the show has never been better, all members really deliver great performances this season, not that season's past had been shoddy, but they all really get numerous moments to shine in this season. The new additions of Justin Hartley as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow and Aaron Ashmore as Jimmy Olsen were perfect for their respective parts, bringing new energy and shaking up the show in really interesting and fun ways.The special effects teams really had their work cut out for them this season, but not surprisingly they rose to the challenge and delivered some really cool visual effects that were fun to watch, especially in the episode 'Justice' where Oliver's team of heroes takes down a 33.1 facility. So many heroes in one episode, with each getting a moment to showcase their power was no doubt fun to write, but was probably a pain to come up with from a special effects standpoint, but the team did a great job, and the episode proved to be one of the best of the season. Two thumbs way up for this department's job on the show.All of the elements I mentioned in the previous 3 paragraphs combined together are what allows ""Smallville"" to continue to be an entertaining series that just keeps getting better and better. This is definitely a show that lives up to its hype, and is a must-see!""Smallville: Season 6"" is unrated and contains violence and mild language.",Smallville: Season 6

You know basically everything that will happen from start to finish. There's no surprise, no smiles and no effort at being more than it is.The movie even suffers from ""End Credit Blooper Syndrome"", which is how you know the filmmakers even knew this was a turkey and figured they might try to solicit a few cheap laughs from you as you leave the theatre in hopes you might remember those cheap laughs and not all the time you spent looking at your watch.I'm at work now and bought this across the street in order to provide myself with some minor amusement. Sadly, even that minor level of amusement eluded me.This film centers around twelve extremely selfish and self-centered children who sabotage their father's efforts at having a career and trying to be a good parent. In doing so, he's managed to secure a huge pay raise, a much larger house and free college for his children. The bastard!Of course, the movie would have you believe that what's really going on is that the father is a Bad Man because he dares to try to have a career and tries to help out his wife so that she can have a career as well (strangely her having a career is not presented as any kind of a problem).This movie is what I would categorize as a ""KOMEDY!"". It's different from a ""comedy"", because in a comedy people do things that make sense and flow logically from what's been happening up to that point. In a KOMEDY! people do things because the script says they do.Case in point: in one scene the children soak someone's underwear in a pile of meat. In the real world, a: someone would have noticed what looks like several pounds of ground meat walking away, and b: no one would be stupid enough to put on underwear that smells of ground meat.Basically this a movie I endured, rather than watched (still better than something like the American version of ""Godzilla"", which can merely be survived and requires a long period of painful recovery afterwords). Steve Martin is a good actor and very funny, and he's the only reason this film gets two stars rather than one (well, and Tom Welling and Ashton Kutcher walking around in not many clothes helps).It's a pity, cause as I said, the basic plot idea here is a good one.

Netrebko and Villazon are incredible actors and singers, for me surpassing Alagna and Georghiu in the Lyon version.

In short, we have three of todays greatest stars, so it could not be anything but great. The performance never drags and is really fun to watch, and is also excellently singed.The only thing which was a bit of a problem for me was the audio, with the sound of the voices varying a bit depending on the location of the singers, which I assume, was due to a not ideal microphones placement. Nevertheless, it was very good in general.I completely disagree with Mr. Erik remarks about Netrebko's attitude.

985896,"After seeing Diary of a Mad Black woman, I decided to give this movie a spin and I'm glad I did.  The number one thing I'm surprised by is Perry's deep subject matters and at the heart of his message about the power of forgiveness.  This is not some hammy Lawrence movie like Big Momma's house.  It's a drama and a comedy and I don't think it was unbalanced at all.  Whenever things get too serious, Madea would show up and deliver the message with a laugh.  For me it was great to see Cicely Tyson, Dr. Maya Angelou and Lynn Whitfield working together.  Perry has found a good thing and I wish him nothing but continue success.  Highly Recommended.",Madea's Family Reunion

1095241,"Kubrick was a technical perfectionist, one who never forgot that always movies are at first a visual craft.I doubt if he considered future television presentations of his movies, as he was well aware of the coming widescreen HD television and that exactly when it would be in place was very uncertain.I first viewed HD t.v.'s for sale in Japanese department stores, when my Japanese wife, in an over-reaction, most appropriate for Japanese, wanted to replace overnight all of her televisons with HD t.v. sets. This was in 1993!!!if you are a Kubrick affectionario, and value image quality as very important, as it should be for Kubrick's masterpieces, then please reflect on the following:resolution WILL degrade when these non-anamorphic negatives are blown up for widescreen t.v.'s.Proper presentation would be matted, as Kurbrick most certainly would have probably desired, to match the original theatrical presentation WITH NO 16X9!However, this is a marketing no no, and Kubrick was well aware of both this and the visual degradation that would occur if released 16x9 with VGA resolution. You want bigger, so then accept the price. Hopefully with HD, we get it all. However, so far with every new digital ""improvement"" aesthetic quality has been compromised...such as downloadable music has very sloppy sound, but it can be marketed. Theoretically, it is possible that these DVD's will be better in some ways then when they are released on HD DVD's.  We are living in a world of trade offs where marketing rules. Those with patience usually do the best.Yes, with the proper matted version, you will have to sit closer to your tube monitor, (still the best viewing quality), to watch the restored, properly matted movies at maximum resolution, or instead, please wait until the HD DVD editions.For an example of the degradation that will occur, see the current widescreen DVD of Full Metal Jacket.Logic would be to wait one or two years for this set to be released on HD DVD. If you can't, then using a step up converter DVD player via a HMID connection to a HD television, probably will lessen the degradation to an acceptabele level. However..if you value highly the visual quality, you will toss away these VGA's soon for the HD DVD copies.  Myself...I do not plan to move on to HD. Only to retain my personal library of approximately 1,000 DVD's, (which I will prune to 700), and step up my VGA to HD using my three DVD players (for back up so I can play them for at least 10 years from now). Therefore..I will be buying all of these new versions, with the proper matting, and have acceptable minimal resolution degradation. In the future, I will begin building a library of HD DVD's but only for new movies and for new releases of ""old"" movies which are better on HD. Many may not be better, or as good. HD may be ""too good"" for early 4:3 black and white movies which thrive on grain. The future may not bode well for Kubricks early masterpieces, or for almost all pre 1954 movies.",N/A

In return, Dersu the jungle man is taken to the city to live with the Captain - a place where his survival instincts are worthless against a civilization that lives by modern technology and use of the gun.In the ultimate analysis, its an essay on the nature of man Vs the context of modern civilization  - how pristine survival instincts programmed since the dawn of human civilization is being progressively degraded and lost by the cocoon that creature comforts of modern civilization have spun created around us. There is definite sense of despair and  nostalgia about this in the message of this film.A must watch film with a serious message about humanity and most of all, about friendship and gratitude.PS: Stay tuned for my next review of a '70s hit comedy that has an uncanny  solidarity to the theme of Dersu Uzala.

380296,"I love the Friday the 13th films. My brother and I snuck into the first one when it was in theaters and I have been a faithful follower of the series since then. I have owned all of the films on VHS, bought the individual DVD's as they came available, and broke down and bought the box set when it first appeared just for the meager extras that were included. I love these movies. With that said, I only recommend ""Jason Goes to Hell"" if you are a completist and need the entire series on DVD. It's no wonder it took a decade after this film for ""Jason X"" to come out, as New Line nearly killed the series here. Fans of the series go to these films for basically one reason....to see Jason do his slasher thing with a forest full of annoying kids. That's it, we don't need a deep plot, we don't even really need an explanation of how Jason is resurrected once again, just have him show up and start chopping in more imaginative ways. So why New Line decided to launch their version of a Friday the 13th film where Jason is only in two scenes makes no sense at all! The plot of this film is a direct rip-off of a flick called ""The Hidden"", but intstead of an alien body-jumping, we get an evil worm thing. To top it all off, while this is a gory flick at times, it is also a very talky flick. The body count is pretty low until the last 15 minutes or so, and by then it's too late to try and save this thing. I see other reveiwers lumping this flick in with ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"", and while I understand their reasoning, I say New Beginning at least keeps the action moving with a HUGE bodycount and at least tries to capture the flavor of a ""Friday"" movie, ""Goes to Hell"" does not. I can see myself popping this thing in every 5 or 6 years or so, just because it's so forgettable I won't remember why I haven't seen it in so long...only to be reminded again at a later date just why this movie collects so much dust sitting on my shelf.",N/A
1075828,"This is one of the best movies of the past year and if it wasn't released so early in the year would be generating Oscar type buzz.  I finished watching this for the second time tonight and was just as blown away by this film as when I saw it in the theater.Who would have thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt from Third Rock from the Sun could give such a brilliant film performance.  He plays Chris Pratt, a former star high school hockey player, suffering from short-term memory loss as a result of a tragic car accident.  Not only did the accident kill his best friend and his best friend's girlfriend, but ended his promising career.Jeff Daniel's is not a favorite of mine, but he gives an equally brilliant performance as Chris's blind housemate.  All of the supporting roles are cast perfectly with Isla Fischer delivering a surpisingly strong performance.This movie resonated with me in a similar way that Memento did (for obvious reasons).  I saw them both right when they were released and came away thinking about them for weeks after I saw them.  The last 30 minutes of this film are absolutely riveting with Gordon-Levitt turning in a performance that is definitely Oscar worthy (even though I am certain the Academy will overlook him).

954260,"This is the first disc I bought from this series.  I bought Godannar from Tower Records when they were going out of business, (I saw the first episode on You Tube and decided to check it out).  All I can say is that I find this show a definite guilty pleasure. I like Giant Robot shows, I like dramatic storylines, and I was sold by the concept that the two Giant Robot Pilots were married.  It is refreshing seeing a female Giant Robot pilot that wasn't a princess or something (see Gundam Seed, Voltron, etc.) But this anime is action packed, quick, In-your-face, and loud.  Screaming commands like in old school anime.  The robot design is clean, cool and realistic (hey not everybody's robot can fly on its own).  I haven't seen that since Escaflowne (manga or anime), but then again, they used magic.The fan service....there is a lot of it.  Necessary and Unnecessary.  I cringe every time they show a panty shot of Lou, a 12 year old space dannar pilot.  The animators also have a lot of fun with Dr. Aoi...Anna's Mom, her breasts always enlarge during any intense situation.  They need to add a giggle counter on this one, because every fight scene, there is some gigglin' goin' on...like the jello commercial.The story is pretty good.  At the end of the disc, I was so pissed at Goh, for always yelling at poor Anna, who's dealing with his ex living with them after she returned from the dead. (HUH?)  Anna's a 17 year girl trying to fit in school, pilot training, being a good wife and battles all into one day.  That's enough to stress anyone out.  My favorite character is ""who the hell do you think I am?!"" Shizuru.  Her determination reminds me of Mokoto from the first season of Sailor Moon.Basically, if you like giant robot shows, a little drama and don't mind a healthy serving of FAN SERVICE...then GODANNAR is for you.Can somebody please tell me where the ""Marriage of god and soul"" is?",N/A
891485,"I was worried that the final movie in the trilogy would run out of ideas, and was afraid it would be so far different than the first film, since Blade 2 already took it to another direction from the first.  Trinity actually returns a bit to the original movie, but with still some fresh ideas in the mix, and the coolest of all - the return of Dracula.In Trinity, the vampires are back without the virus that infected them in the 2nd film.  They bring back the oldest and purest vampire to ever live who goes by many names, but most familiar is ""Dracula""  He is able to walk in daylight, and they are hoping to use him to be able to do the same.  Meanwhile, Blade is set up for murdering a human, and becomes the number one wanted criminal in the town.  The new charcaters eneter the scene - Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abagail Whistler (Jessica Biel) who help Blade and introduce him to their group of vampire hunters.Surprisingly, the addition of two more heores to the film was played out nicely.  Unlike Batman & Robin (a film that stank no matter how you look at it)  the adiditon of Robin and Bat Girl was ridiculous and pushed Batman aside.  Not in Blade Trinity.  Everyone has their own space, and fights their own fights.  Another good thing about this film is it improves over the 2nd with much less use of CGI.  The fights look real again, much like in the first film.  As far as fights go, I found there to be plenty of action, but actually less overall compared to the first two films.  While Blade's final one on one in Blade 2 was my favorite in the trilogy, his fight against Dracula was rather spectacular too.  Hannibal king also gets to fight a huge vampire bare fisted, played by Triple H - who not surprsingly gets in a few rather cool wrestling moves.Overall, Trinity is a pleasing end to the trilogy.  It actually opens more doors in a way than closes, but Spike TV went on to create Blade the series in 2006, which is worth checking out if its available to you.  In Trinity, I enjoyed the plot more than Blade 2, but in the end the first Blade is supreme.  The entire trilogy though, is one of the coolest trilogies ever created - go get it today.",N/A
1080381,"Yep, this is the 70's BBC production of Dracula. It is considered the most accurate portrayal of the book on film. And in my opinion, it is! All the way down tho the gory and often slooooooooooow details. Louis Jourdan does a great job as the Count and the rest of the cast does very well in their respective roles as well, but I often found myself wanting to push the fast-forward button on my remote just to get to some excitement. I can appreciate a filmmaker's desire to stay true to the novel, but their should be some surprises that those of us who've read the book won't expect. That's the whole point in film adaptations of books: FRESH INTERPRETATION!The scenery and sets are beautiful and as I said, all the acting is well done. It is old, so some of the SFX are outdated, but the fangs and blood red eyes add great scare tactics. The one other thing that bothered me, however, was the use of thermal imaging. In  a few shots (used for FX), we get to see vampires in HEAT VISION!

1034176,"Pitched as `the movie the oil companies don't want you to see' but instead proving to be the movie nobody wanted to see, The Formula is a classic example of how blockbuster novels so often turn into mundane films. It has a solid cast, a solid script, solid production values - everything, in fact, but a reason to watch it. It's one of those lethargic thrillers where cardboard characters constantly talk to each other about things that happened offscreen and which the film would have been far better showing us as George C. Scott's LA cop uncovers a conspiracy involving a Nazi formula for synthetic fuel that Marlon Brando's eccentric oilman wants kept under lock and key so he can artificially inflate the price of oil. The teaming of Oscar's two most famous refusniks sadly provides no sparks - indeed, there was reportedly more drama offscreen at the time between director John G. Avildsen and writer/producer Steve Shagan over the re-editing of the film, so it's a genuine surprise to find them jovially sharing the audio commentary on Warners' new DVD. Not that it seems that anyone else was so passionate about the film: there's no shortage of class talent here (John Gielgud and Beatrice Straight also turn up), but it's clear that the paycheck is of more interest to them than the script and they're just slumming it. Not a terrible movie, just a rather flat, uneventful and predictable one.Warners' widescreen 1.85:1 DVD transfer is adequate, but not up to their usual standards, with the mono soundtrack particularly flat.

738608,"Of all the ""Don Carlo's"" available I have only seen the Von Karajan.  But for starters any version which omits the Fontanbleu scene is out of the running.  Verdi rewrote the confrontation between Phillipe and Elisabeth and the final duet between Elisabeth and Carlo when he made the shorter version without the first act.  Unfortunately, all of these revisions weakened the drama in my opinion.  As to the principles, surely Domingo is a better singer and actor than Lima but Lima is more appropriate physically, even though his ""hamming"" gets a bit silly at times.  But Domingo may be the only asset in the Met version.  Judging from comments on this site about other versions, the Met had some problems with the lower roles.  In the Haitink performance Zancanaro gives a flawless performance.  Others have faulted his acting, but though it is understated, I feel that his work is beyond criticism.  He always strikes the right mood.  Watch his glances at the other characters that he is not addresssing.  He is always manley and subtle.  As to his singing, others have commented on his excellence. To me, he is the best Verdi Baritone on DVD.  Thanks goodness he did not stay a policemen (his first career, evidently) LLoyd has a gorgeous sound. And he is suitably imperious and mencacing. Some have complained about the Grand Inquisitor but he is supposed to be an old man.  I, myself, find it disconcerting when I hear a young singer with a fresh voice singing what should be a old person.  It doesn't work.  Generally though, age bothers me less than some other reviewers.  Elisabeth looks a bit old, sure, but Cotrubas give a very touching performance in a role probably too ""big"" for her.  But contrast her with Freni.  Between her vocal lines Freni is mentally counting until her next entrance. Cotrubas is in character every moment of the performance. The Eboli is disappointing although she acts well enough.  The voice just isn't up to the demands of the role.  Others have praised Baltsa but I found her Eboli in the Karajan unbelievable coarse.  I think it might be remembered that court life, especially during the Inquisition, was a very sticky business.  People would be more likely to behave in a restrained manner at all times lest a false move anger the people they served.  This production, as conceived by Lucchino Visconti, is dark and brooding, restrained and subtle as well.  After two viewings It emerges as moving drama which fits together in spite of flaws to form an absorbing whole. I feel that it totally serves the greatness of the work.",N/A

That would be news to Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny, and Suetonius who, by the way,((( weren't particularly inclined toward this messianic character )))or his fringe following.Unfortunately, that comment didn't carry sufficient heft for the academian.A troubling question--if Jesus never existed, how did a Christian community arise within the living memory of those who were his contemporaries?Even more--why did they allow themselves to be thrown into the Coliseum by Nero for a fictitious hero?For whatever one may believe about the historical evidence about Jesus, one stubborn fact remains: the emergence (and persecution!) of a first century community that grew out of the teachings of a leader whose credentials could have been checked out from any number of surviving eyewitnesses.Jesus myth - Did He really live?Is the Jesus myth true? Is Jesus just the fabrication of a bunch of religious zealots? Some people would like us to believe that the existence of Jesus is nothing more than a myth. To examine this question, let's start by looking at how some people have defined the word ""myth.""a traditional story accepted as history; serves to explain the worldview of a peoplea story, usually of teleological content, that relates not historical fact but historical ""experience"" of its writer or culture. It is not a chronicle of ""what was or is"" but a profound expression of ""how things are.""an anonymous tale emerging from the traditional beliefs of a culture or social unit. Myths use supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. They may also explain cosmic issues like creation and death.If Jesus did not really exist, He would fit these definitions because He would not be part of history or historical fact. Conversely, even if He really did exist, the last definition implies that who He claimed to be could still be a myth if the supernatural miracles He performed had natural explanations or He was not the Creator He claimed to be or He really didn't have power over death He claimed to have.It appears that the person who wrote the last definition tailored it to fit Jesus. He apparently believed that Jesus was not what He claimed to be and consequently was a myth.Raising the potential mythology of Jesus is a fair question and believing in the Jesus myth is an acceptable position as long as such a conclusion is based upon a careful, unbiased examination of the evidence and not based upon what we want to believe.Many of us may want to jump to that conclusion just to avoid our responsibility toward God and to our neighbors that we would be forced to consider if Jesus is real and is who He says He is.Any careful and objective study of the facts that surround Jesus birth, life, death, and resurrection will convince anyone that Jesus is real and that He is who He said He was.Many people have done research specifically to discredit the reality of Jesus and who He claimed to be or examined their atheistic beliefs and ended up proclaiming the truth of Jesus and the Bible.Some of these that have written their story in a book include Josh McDowell, Lee Strobel, Sir William M. Ramsey, and Randall Niles.Without even getting into many detailed historical, archeological, scientific, and documentary facts, consider the following to see if Jesus' existence and His claim to be God are consistent with the facts:Our calendar is based upon the birth of Jesus both counting backwards (BC) before His birth and forwards (AD) after His birth. Why would we base our calendar on a myth?Why have Christians been persecuted throughout history if Jesus is a myth?If Jesus is a myth, why do people take His name in vein?Why does the mere name of Jesus instill such hatred and controversy and why is just mentioning the name of Jesus taboo if He is a myth?If Jesus and His resurrection was a myth, why did all the apostles die for what they knew to be a lie?How have so many lives been transformed from unsatisfying, self-destructive behaviors that are like a curse on themselves, their families, and society to a purposeful, satisfying life that is a blessing to society?How do you explain the wisdom that Jesus had when answering peoples questions when they tried to trick and trap Him?How do you explain how Jesus fulfilled all the messianic prophecies in the Old Testament that could not have been fulfilled by random chance?Why was Jesus crucified and why were the apostles murdered if it's all a myth?Many religious concepts are consistent with human thinking. Some promise to make us gods. Some promise many virgins. Some promise utopia. These concepts are consistent with human thinking. How do you explain God's plan that includes Jesus giving up His God status to become a lowly man; to live a perfect life and to die for us by our own hand and to save us from our sins. This is clearly not a concept that men would create.In the beginning was the Word,and the Word was with God,and the Word was God.He was with God in the beginning.Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.Whoever believes in him is not condemned,but whoever does not believe standscondemnedalreadybecause he has not believed in the name of God's one and only SonLastly, is organized religion bad?Yeshas racism always existed, and still does?Yesdoes it exist around the globe and not just in the USA?Yes",The God Who Wasn't There

I've seen the Richard Gere version, and frankly, all I remember about it is the MTV music video for the theme song. The original gave me a completely different perception of the story, and the ending surprised me. I thought Jean-Paul Belmondo did a fantastic job with a complex character. There's a press conference scene that I thought was important to the story, as well. I wish I spoke French, because I think there are nuances in the dialogue not captured in the subtitles, but nevertheless, I think this is an enjoyable film in addition to all the cinematic masterpiece accolades.",Breathless A Bout de Souffle  VHS

1021096,"The most blatant flaw with this production was the casting:  The handsome Toby Stephens (like the gorgeous Timothy Dalton in the earlier BBC production) is totally inappropriate because Bronte depicts Rochester as an ugly, Vulcan-like man of medium height.  (Also, Stephens' acting (he's not convincing as a man who has lived in empty misery for 15 years) is mediocre, so he's not credible on that score, either.)  In the novel Jane is a small woman with irregular features.  Ruth Wilson is a tall beauty.  One of the things Rochester and Jane understand about one another is how it feels to be considered ugly relative to the population at large.  As a couple, Wilson and Stephens would easily fit in at a Hollywood party.  Clearly the idolatry of the modern age influenced the director, who, given the BBC's reputation for quality television should have known better.  The cynical view is that Stephens' status as the son of renowned British actress Dame Maggie Smith influenced his casting.A lot of time was spent highlighting the romance scenes between Rochester and Jane, Celine and Rochester, St. John and Miss Oliver, and even Bertha and Rochester. I believe this was done to attract young women viewers who will love these scenes -- and buy the DVD.  We don't, however, see much of (1) Bronte's criticism of the Church (i.e., St. John's coldness of heart, and its inconsistency with Jesus' character, or Mr. Brocklehurst's cruelty), or (2) the persistence of good in an evil environment (as displayed in Bessie, Ms. Temple, Helen Burns), both major themes in the novel.  Clearly, commercial appeal won out over artistic quality and the author's intent.Though the production is not embarrassing (notwithstanding the acting of several characters is not of the caliber one expects in a BBC production), it is disappointing in its blatant refusal to honor the key features of the novel (i.e., ugly people can find love, too; hypocrisy and cruelty in the Church of England; child abuse; Christian duty to do right when life has been hard).  (Again, these themes won't sell DVDs.) The Sorcha Cusack/Michael Jayston production (1973) is the most faithful to the novel and an absolute delight to watch.  This and the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke production are the best versions of the great story.",N/A

1079035,"Anthony Hopkins loves movies where he can wipe the floor with his costars. He is almost giddy in roles like Hannibal Lector. His character in director Gregory Hoblit's latest thriller, Fracture, is no different. Like the eggshell analogy that Hopkins makes to his costar Ryan Gosling, Fracture falls prey to the same smarmy advice the star gives out: everything, no matter how perfect it may look, has a flaw.When wealthy and intelligent aerodynamics expert Ted Crawford (Hopkins) catches his wife in an act of infidelity with a Los Angeles homicide detective, he cooks up an elaborate plan to not only kill his wife, but to legally get away with it. What should have been an open and shut case for District Attorney Willy Beachum turns into a career ending nightmare as Crawford seemingly outsmarts the law at every turn.Though the direction, acting and visual style in Fracture is fantastic, the hairline crack that splinters the picture is the film's attempt at creating suspense by relying on a twist ending that is easily predictable given the information that is presented early in the film. How exactly does Crawford shoot his wife in the face with a weapon that has never been fired? Given the revealing marketing for the film, which gives away the circumstances surrounding the murder, audiences can easily trace the steps that Hopkins takes early in the film, clearly giving them an idea of where Fracture is going.In the best thrillers, when the inevitable twist hits, it is the little clues scattered throughout the picture which give the ending credibility. While all these details are within Fracture, they are so clear that if you don't see the crack in the villain's flawless plan immediately, you will be kicking yourself when the film finally presents it to you.That being said, how does Fracture manage to hold the audience's attention despite its blatant reveal of the picture's number one mystery? While a less experienced director might rely heavily on this twist alone, Gregory Hoblit manages to see through what could have been a thinly veiled, plot driven movie and finds an intriguing character study.While Hopkins chews up the scenery with his vast intellect and charming whit, Fracture is really the story of Willy Beachum. Considering the fact that Fracture consists of a cast which includes an Academy Award winner and two nominees, it was to be expected that Hoblit should have no problem drawing performances from his actors. The real surprise in Fracture is just how well planned out the story of Willy Beachum was.Ryan Gosling's character begins the film as an arrogant, hot shot district attorney who has been put on the fast track, landing a job in the private sector. Thinking that Crawford's case will be the last in his short tenure serving the public, Beachum shrugs off what appears to be an easy win. His refusal to take the case seriously, combined with Crawford's meticulous planning, ultimately leads to Beachum's downfall. With his cushy job in jeopardy, Beachum's character develops a methodical obsession with Crawford, searching desperately to find the one clue that will put his nemesis away for good.As the film progresses Gosling's character changes from cocky to heroic. At first it is fun to see Hopkins toy with him, but thanks to Gosling's surprisingly good acting and Hoblit's taught direction, as Beachum changes, so does the audience's expectations. We want Gosling to come out on top. This change, from selfishness to selflessness is what gives his character the roundness that carries Fracture past its faults.Though predictable, it is the dramatic arc of Willy Beachum which separates Fracture from just another episode of Law and Order. While Hopkins' character begins the film as a smarmy antihero, he essentially pushes Beachum into becoming the unlikely champion of the story, and in some ways Fracture showcases one legendary actor passing on the torch to another.-Joe Russo",N/A

1027322,"Being a huge Kaiju Eiga fan, and (unlike the previous reviewer) crazy about the Daimajin films, I had to have this, even though I do own the ADV set AND the Japanese Laserdisc set. It's rather nostalgic to see these in the English-dubbed versions I first saw in the 1960s. Obviously, these films suffer greatly from the Pan-and-Scan treatment, and the dubbed dialogue is a bit silly at times. Print quality is watchable if far from ideal, and there is one ridiculous moment in MAJIN in which there is a reel change, and the leader is actually left in there...for a split-second, an upside-down photo of a woman can actually be seen! Come on, guys- how difficult would it have been to edit that out? Is Retromedia trying to recreate the ""UHF Experience"" with such goofs? We may never know...if you must see the dubbed versions of these films, get this, but be advised of its inherent inferiority to the real deal.

975198,"***1/2Lawrence Sterne's 18th Century novel, ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"" has long been viewed as a largely ""unfilmable"" work due to its enormous length and famously idiosyncratic style. The bawdy, satirical tome, done in the form of a mock-autobiography, originally appeared in nine volumes and broke new artistic ground by employing the kind of stream-of-consciousness narration and self-referential self-awareness that would later come to define the post-modernist style of 20th and 21st Century literature. As one of the characters in the movie exclaims, the ahead-of-its-time ""Shandy"" was already post-modern before modern existed.The movie, ""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story,"" is NOT a version of the novel either but rather a droll, frequently hilarious faux-documentary about one movie crew's valiant but futile attempt to bring this unwieldy literary work to the silver screen. Writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce and director Michael Winterbottom have used Sterne's novel as a mere reference point for their own slashing satire on film-making in general and the adaptation of great novels in particular. Indeed, the movie is as much a tribute to Fellini's ""8 1/2"" - another film about a filmmaker's struggle to complete a challenging movie - as it is to ""Tristram Shandy."" The movie makers even employ Nina Rota's score from that film as background for the action rather than music that would more accurately reflect the period of the story. Talk about post-modern!Steve Coogan plays himself as the actor hired on to inhabit the roles of both Tristram and his father, Walter, in the film that is being made. Joining him is Rob Brydon, who also plays himself as well as Tristram's uncle, Toby. In the modern scenes, the two are acutely funny as they squabble over how each is to play his respective part and who is to be allotted the most time on screen. However, the best parts of the movie are the scenes re-creating the novel on film, which are done with an anarchic spirit and a freewheeling cleverness that put one in mind of Tony Richardson's ""Tom Jones."" With their raillery and wit, these sequences almost convince us that, given the sufficient resources and the proper talents, maybe a decent movie COULD be made of Sterne's novel (or at least a small part of it) after all.Some of the film-making sequences are enjoyable as well, zeroing in on the compromises brought about by having to balance budgetary restraints with personal egos. Yet, the movie tends to run out of steam the further away it gets from Sterne's original story. Coogan is amusing as a character when he is focused on the mechanics of his acting, but he's far less interesting when brooding about his troubled relationship with his girlfriend, his role as a new daddy or his contemplation of an affair with his attractive assistant. These scenes, which take up a significant portion of the final act of the movie, wind up draining away much of the cleverness and energy that are found in such abundance during the earlier stretches of the film. Yet, if ""A Cock and Bull Story"" finally dribbles away into insignificance at the end, it still provides us with an hour and a half or so of really hearty laughter as compensation. And considering how few genuine laughs one generally encounters in movies these days, that's a strong bit of compensation indeed.",Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story

31977,"Adam Sandler's film career has had its ups and downs.  From the easily forgotten ""Billy Madison"" to the well-intentioned but slightly miscued ""Click,"" Sandler has played both straight man and buffoon to varying degrees of success.  In ""The Wedding Singer,"" Sandler manages to harness his inner goofball and pulls off a wonderful performance in what is probably his best film to date.Sandler plays Robbie Hart, an aspiring songwriter who plays weddings for extra cash until his career takes off.  He's nice to old ladies, lives in his sister's basement, and is the best wedding singer money can buy.  At the opening of the film, Robbie and his bandmates are setting the dancefloor aflame with the 80's classic, ""You Spin Me Round"" (originally by Dead or Alive).  While at this wedding reception, Robbie runs into Julia (played to sweet perfection by Drew Barrymore), a soon-to-be married server with the catering service at the reception.  The two hit it off instantly and become good friends.  Julia even works at Robbie's wedding and witnesses his being left at the altar by his would-be wife, Linda.Robbie falls into a funk, refusing to play any and every wedding reception he's offered, including Julia's.  He eventually agrees to help her set up her wedding with her Don Johnson wannabe fiance, Glenn (Matthew Glave).  As any good romantic comedy would have happen, Robbie and Julia begin to fall for each other and their respective fiances are proven to be no good and undeserving of their love.  Even though, neither Robbie nor Julia can openly reveal their love for one another to anybody.  In the end, everything is tied nicely together by a ballad sung by Robbie, and everyone goes home happy.The cast in this film is wonderful. Christine Taylor plays Holly, Julia's loose cousin.  Frank Sivero is hilarious in a brief role as Robbie's brother-in-law.  Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitz also have bit roles but make the most of them.  Sandler's buddy, Allen Covert, plays his best friend, Sammy, a limo driver who wants to be like the Fonz.  Alexis Arquette is George, a Boy George lookalike.  Also look for Kevin Nealon as a banker who interviews Robbie.Of course, the one thing most people seem to focus on in this film is the music and fashion of the 80's.  Pop culture abounds in this film with references to Van Halen's breakup, Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson's ""strong"" marriage, J.R. getting shot on ""Dallas,"" Freddy Krueger, all temperCheer, and the Dunkin' Donuts guy.  The musical lineup includes songs by Journey, Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, David Bowie, and Huey Lewis and the News among others.  Heck, Billy Idol even has a scene-stealing cameo on a flight to Las Vegas.Obviously, if you grew up in the 80's, you're going to catch onto most of the pop culture references in the film.  However, you need not know them in order to enjoy this film.  It's a hilarious romantic comedy that showcases the talents of Sandler and Barrymore, and I highly recommend it.",N/A

Lester Dent, Issac Asimov, and a host of other authors wrote what is now, decades before the real items existed.Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay, took a hit concept from the 80's and 90's, and with the assistance of exceptional CGI, turned out a movie that surprised film goers around the world.Transformers' Sam Witwicky, begins this adventure of a lifetime carshopping with Dad.  In the Porsche lot, out of the Porsche lot, into the used car lot.  Sam learns a valuable lesson from the salesman, you don't choose a car, it chooses you.  And so a beat up Camaro chooses his `master', while destroying the car lot.  And so Bumblebee enters his life, and soon, a full blown war between the Decepticons and Autobots engulfs his home town.Not only is there action, but humor as well.  Sam, his girlfriend, the US military, and his robot friends exchange barbs like `I bought a car.  Turned out to be a robot.  Who knew?'  And the `discussion' from Sam's mother on why he had to lock the door?  `Were you masterbating?  Or should we call it your private time.....?'  It's touches like that which turn this film from a CGI dominated production into a film you can watch and enjoy.Sure, it'll re-introduce many of the Transformers back into pop culture.  Sure, there will be a sequel.  Yes, the comic will come back one more time.  And yes, it will be a hit one more time.Don't forget the toys....Tim Lasiuta",Transformers

I must say that I, too, am disappointed that we are so limited to one episode per season.  It would've been nice if we had maybe at least five to ten  episodes from each season.  PLEASE put more than one episode per season as one is NOT enough!!!  And like Raul, I also got pretty annoyed with the Falling Baker's representing the Number 2 skit over and over again!  I would like to see Falling Baker's 3-10 skits if at ALL possible please!With the negative stuff out of the way, it was nice taking a trip down memory lane and pretending I was back at being a pre-schooler again.  Nice seeing the Fonz (Henry Winkler) and Archie Cunningham (Ron Howard)  doing a skit on brushing teeth, Helen Reddy singing about Growing. Kermit's skit of seeing Humpty Dumpty being put back together again and seeing him accidently knocking Humpty off again is a TRUE classic, among with a brief cameo of Carol Burnett (if I'm not mistaken) and the list is ENDLESS here!!!  LOVED seeing Don Music and his head-banging against his piano for the short of Mary Had a Little Lamb.  Please put more of Don in future Old School Box Sets!!!

847069,"I know how ""adorable"" Sofia Vassilieva supposedly comes across--but the character of Eloise she portrays in this Yuletide-themed disaster is nothing short of a horrific, negative example for children everywhere.She's pushy.  She's snotty.  She disregards Nanny's beautifully-accented orders at every turn.  Little Eloise also mistakenly believes that since her father owns the Plaza, it's her birthright to interfere in the private lives of both staff and guests.Now, clearly Disney transforms this nightmarish little Puck into an agent of Cupid and everything (as usual) turns out peachy keen for all involved.Still, Eloise is a pint-sized terror.  I was hoping someone would toss the midget, mouthy malcreant down one of the Plaza's many elevator shafts.One of the less tiresome moments for the character is at the very end, when a mysterious, face-cannot-be-glimpsed female figure (decked out in a fabulous mink coat--props for the outerwear) grandly arrives.  It's Eloise's mother.  Who apparently only can stand being in the presence of her child two or three times of the year.Do I feel that.",Eloise At Christmastime

1052912,"Audacious and unpredictable, `Little Children' focuses on a few lives in East Wyndorf, a pleasant, sleepy suburban town in Massachusetts.  Probing below their decency, director Todd Field unfolds a vision where everyone is found out to be amiss in some way.  Although `Little Children' is the title, the adults headline the movie, even if the children become their antecedent reflection.  Sara (Kate Winslet) brings her daughter, Lucy, daily to the pool or park.  While Lucy plays, Sara listens to the idle chatter of other moms.  Her path crosses with Brad (Patrick Wilson)--known to them as ""The Prom King""--when they bet her she can't obtain his phone number.  Immediately, she makes a move, and, when successful, they become indignant, even if they only refer to him in lustful terms.  Brad also brings his son, Aaron, to the pool and park.  He's the caretaker, studying for his bar exam, while his wife remains the breadwinner away at work.  Sara catches her husband, Richard, having a fantasy affair with someone on the Internet.  Brad seems to go through the motions of a marriage with a wife he considers ""a knockout"".  This gives them a justifying context for adultery. At first their infatuation starts as companionship, but a storm consummates their infidelity.  In the meantime, child sex offender, Ronald (Jackie Earle Hayley), known for exposing himself to children, has moved into town, even as his face is plastered on every post and broadcast on the local news.  He has the disposition only a mother could love.  (""You're a miracle,"" she tells him, ""...because as humans we all know the people we love can be taken away."" ""Animals aren't like that,"" she reminds him.)  Brad also makes reluctant connections with Larry, a disturbed ex-police officer friend who had an entailed mishap with an alleged young mall-sniper. He enlists Brad on ""The Guardians"" football team, a group of officers whose campaign against Ronald is the focus of their camaraderie.  Insecure, he seems to need ""Ronnie"" as a scapegoat for his own shortcomings.The movie's acting has been justly lauded, and the haunting development is a real draw.  Thinking the movie might be a travesty, I was surprised by the humane treatment it gave its subject matter(s).  It`s easy to see why critics are raving and the public is turning away.  Hard to describe, sometimes 'Little Children' seems like 'Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' without the laughs.  There's a build up to the movie, though.  Using the town's train as a sort of Freudian metaphor and atmosphere of tension and passion, the movie meets it's climax with some thoughts to ponder.  `Little Children' studies the premise we are all half living:  What would happen if everyone got what one wanted?  The film answers this question by asking a different question.  If everyone got what they wanted, who would suffer?  Surely, only a decent person could answer.",N/A
650306,"I didn't think it was possible for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" to be worse than the last pirates movie, ""Dead Man's Chest."" I was wrong.I can't understand why the second and third installments of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films are so craptastic when the first movie was so amazing. ""At World's End"" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. As with ""Dead Man's Chest,"" the problem rests entirely with the script. I will not even attempt to describe the plot of this movie because it's so ridiculous and awful. The third movie is the worst of the series because the basic plot is stupid, there are 25,000 dumb things going on at once, and most of the dialogue is lousy and provides little comic relief. Among the asinine aspects of ""At World's End"" are the schizophrenic Jack Sparrows, the ""Attack of Johnny Depp's Nose""/crab walk scene, Calypso the 100-foot-tall giantess, and what happens to Will Turner at the end of the movie. (Is this seriously supposed to be a happy ending for Will and Elizabeth?! My cat could have penned a better script!)There are a few redeeming qualities about the film, and there's room for me to list them all here because they are so few and far between:+ Geoffrey Rush is back as Captain Barbossa. If he wasn't in this movie (which is almost three hours long, by the way: it was excruciating to sit through), I couldn't have made it to the end. I seriously would have walked out of the theatre after less than an hour.+ The special effects are fantastic.+ We get to see Johnny Depp without his shirt on. (It's only for a fraction of a second and he was looking rather pasty, but still...it was definitely a highlight of the film.)+ We also get to see Bill Nighy's face without the crazy Squid Man ensemble. That glimpse only lasts for a brief moment, but I welcomed any break from Squid Man.+ Keith Richards has a brief cameo as Jack's father. He's absolutely hysterical in the film. (Sadly, I think there were only a handful of people in the theatre who knew who Keith Richards IS. It's so sad.)To say that I was disappointed with this movie would be an understatement. It's a terrible, terrible film. I wish the ""Pirates"" sequels had never been made, or that I'd been asked to write the screenplays instead, because I can guarantee that I'd crank out better material than this garbage.Let's just hope that there isn't a ""Pirates 4!""",N/A

It is a devilish appearance and this confirms the multi-faceted talents of a Great Actor as McKellen rightfully is.Brad Renfro, although playing his role with honesty, is far less threatening as one may wish, although he adds a component of freshness to his role, in which we can honestly believe.Younger generations can, at times, be very cruel, but don't many times, fully understand or appreciate the risks and dangers connected with reopening old wounds in elder people.It is a very interesting social case study, very well developed by director Bryan Singer, who is a very good storyteller and paces all his movies in such a way, as never becoming stale.It is shocking to see that at times, fiction foretells reality.But this is not just a thriller or a psychological horror movie, it is far more.

Director Romero does an excellent job of reproducing Hutton's hidden ""twin"" who sprang to life as an alias,protecting a young college professor's true identity. But,devilry often seems to feed upon itself, especially here when Hutton goes on writing binges which satiate his dark  side on paper, but also fuel the flames of his ""twin"".

1013001,"After watching this movie on cable recently, I didn't know what to think. Was this supposed to be a ""romantic comedy""? If so, maybe I missed something, because I failed to see any real humor in it. If anything, I found it to be rather sad - two people in a relationship suddenly finding all kinds of faults with one another until they decide to call it quits. And oh yeah, they just happen to share a condo together, but neither one of them wants to move out. I guess that was supposed to be the humorous hook in this script, but even that isn't very amusing. The whole story itself was conceived by Vince Vaughn, who I give kudos to for coming up with a pretty good idea. Because Vince was behind it, you would have expected it to be funny - not so. It starts off funny, but somewhere along the line, you stop laughing.I just never believed that these two could be a couple in the first place. After all, they had nothing in common. Vince as Gary is in partnership with his two brothers in a Chicago tourism venture, but he is also lazy, sloppy, loud, immature, uncultured and he reverted to his bachelor habits far too quickly for me to believe that he really had any feelings for Brooke (Jennifer Aniston). Brooke is an uptight, prissy, perfectionist-type who works in an art gallery and seems too much of a diva to find Gary to be appealing, not to mention entering into the kind of commitment buying a condo together would take. They are as mismatched as oil and vinegar and I just didn't feel like there was any on-screen chemistry between them. Off-screen, it might have been a different story for Vince and Jen, but that didn't translate well in this film. I found it hard to sympathize with either of their characters. All I saw was a couple constantly arguing, finding different ways to hurt each other's feelings over and over again, and demanding family and friends to take sides in their dispute. It was upsetting, not to mention tiresome. Again, there were some moments that make you laugh, but not enough to label this a comedy. However, I especially liked Judy Davis' role as Marilyn, the fiesty gallery owner and Brooke's boss.Like one of the reviewers mentioned, real love means accepting someone for whom they are and not trying to change them, which I thought Brooke wanted to do with Gary. She should have paid more attention to the type of person he was, because I'm quite sure he wasn't hiding those aspects of himself from her. She could have made the decision not to get involved with him. So basically, she knew what she was getting into. It should have been no surprize to her when Gary didn't want to do certain things or behaved in an immature manner. All of the pain they endure could have been avoided if she kept those things in mind.I will say, however, that the ending was totally unpredictable and I expected to see something else. This is not a bad movie; it kept me interested from beginning to end. But be warned - don't expect to laugh too much.",N/A

1016657,"ER has had several memorable episodes over the course of its first five seasons.  We saw Mark Greene attempt to deliver a baby in Season 1 that cost the life of the mother.  We had Doug Ross in Season 2 courageously saves a boy trapped in a storm drain.  And yet, as powerful as those episodes were, even they pale in comparison to Season 6's ""All in the Family.""Before I comment on that episode, we see some new additions to the cast of ER.  Goran Visnijic debuts as Dr. Kovac.  I liked him much better in these earlier seasons before they made him a carbon copy of Doug Ross when he was a womanizer.Michael Michele comes aboard as Dr. Cleo Finch, the new Attending Pediatric physician.  Finch is a good doctor who really cares about her patients, and Michele does a great job of demonstrating this.Erik Palladino is a new, young ER resident, Dr. Dave Malucci.  Malucci is the gung-ho doctor who doesn't have much of a bedside manner, but who is over-eager for the most difficult cases.  Malucci's impulsiveness tends to land him in hot water, especially with Dr. Weaver.Ming-Na also makes her return here as Dr. ""Deb"" Chen.  I really liked her in Season 1 of ER, and I was thrilled when she came back.  She was always a good counterpart for Carter, as the two always seemed to be in competition with each other.Season 6 also has the first appearance of Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) who is doing a rotation as an OBGYN nurse before beginning her rotation down in the ER.Season 6 also has one of the great guest appearances by Alan Alda playing Dr. Gabriel Lawrence.  Dr. Lawrence was the doctor who trained Kerry Weaver, and when a medical condition arises in Dr. Lawrence, Weaver has a difficult time facing her mentor and friend.  There is a great scene between these two characters during his final appearance that is touching.The season is a good one, and the acting talents of Noah Wyle are really put to the test, especially in the episodes that follow after ""All in the Family"" when Carter tries to deal with his guilt as well as the trauma that he suffers.  Wyle was always a strong actor and played Carter with an almost innocent quality.  Perhaps this is truly the first time that we see Carter with a loss of that innocence.This season also sees the exit of the third member of the original cast.  One of the small problems in this season is that, at times, you have too many cast members and too little screen time.  At one point, there are twelve regular cast members during the course of this season.  There simply isn't enough time to really showcase them all, especially the new additions to the cast.SPOILER ALERT BELOWNow, on to the episode of ""All in the Family.""  I still recall vividly the first time I saw this episode when it aired.  It was unlike anything I'd seen on television before.  It was so powerful and poignant, that even seeing it again moves me inexplicably.Dr. Carter and Lucy Knight have just been brutally stabbed by a psych patient.  This occurs at the very end of the previous episode.  So, imagine waiting an entire week to find out what happens next!  This was one of the biggest cliff-hangers that I can remember, and everyone made sure they were available to watch this episode to find out what was going to happen to Carter and Lucy.  Very few people foresaw what transpired.The entire ER springs to action when Dr. Weaver discovers them on the floor in the trauma room lying in pools of blood.  There's nothing like a team coming together for a single purpose, especially when that purpose is dire.  There is something especially powerful in such actions.Benton is nearly out of control when he discovers that Carter has been injured.  Perhaps for the first time in the series, we really see and understand how the usually emotionally cold Dr. Benton feels about Carter.  It's on his face and in his actions.  As Benton tries to assure Carter that he will be all right, Carter says in a cracking voice, ""I'm glad it's you,"" when he realizes that Benton is going to operate on him.Equally strong is Dr. Corday and Dr. Romano working feverishly to save Lucy's life.  Dr. Romano, who seems to care about no one at all, can't even hide his anger, frustration, and grief when it's clear that Lucy can't be saved.  In many ways, Romano is the doctor who speaks for the audience.  Seeing this episode for the first time, it was unbelievable that Lucy was dead.  It wasn't often that a major character was killed in an on-going series, and so Romano expresses his anger and disbelief for us, and he does it well as he sends surgical instruments flying across the room.Just when you think that ER can no longer surprise you, they came up with this episode.  Word has it that Kellie Martin no longer felt comfortable being on the show as her own real-life sister was a traumatic victim of lupus.You have to credit the writers for coming up with this episode.  Very few, if any, characters up to this point in television history have had such a powerful and heart-wrenching exit as Kellie's character here on ER.  I recall the following Friday everyone talking about it.There have been previous events in ER that were terrific episodes, and there were even a couple more that would follow after Season 6, but ""All in the Family"" is still the premiere ER episode that truly defines the pinnacle of a great drama series.",N/A

958788,"House of 9 (Steven R. Monroe, 2004)Sometimes you go into a movie not expecting much, and you end up wowed by it. House of 9 is the first movie to do that to me this year. I was expecting just another not-very-good entry in the microbudget horror wars; what I ended up with was a fine (though not without flaws) absurdist drama, The Exterminating Angel on crack with gratuitous violence. I'll tell you now, before writing the rest of the review: you want to see this movie.For reasons of his own-- reasons of which neither the characters in the film, nor we, are ever apprised-- a nameless, unseen, very rich individual (voiced by Ella Enchanted's Jim Carter) abducts nine people and seals them in a mansion. Their mission: to be the only person to leave the house alive. The reward: five million dollars.While the movie suffers from some average-at-best acting and an overly facile ending you'll see coming a mile off, they're balanced out by a smashing script, brilliant set design, and a willingness to break every rule in the book. House of 9 isn't a horror film. It's not even a survival thriller, at least not for most of its length. The first half of the film is about the characters forming bonds, trying to learn the rules of their environment, and eventually devolving (with outside assistance). Luis Bunuel would probably not jump to anoint Steven Monroe his successor based on this film, but at least he's not spinning in his grave. If you go into this movie without expectations, you'll find yourself with a very pleasant surprise. *** ",House of 9

This movie is about mismatched romantic partners and it is also about friendship, classical music, philosophy, and there is even a bit of slapstick comedy thrown in for those who get easily bored with talk.One of his best movies and I suggest you watch it or buy it.",N/A

From ""Dinner at Eight"" in 1933 to ""My Fair Lady"" in 1964, the genius of this man has created a body of classic films unequaled in my humble opinion.

180161,"BEWARE SPOILERS!One of the Message Boards threads at IMDb had two women talking about Colin Firth, how they watched the movie only because of him.  Obviously these were two young women; but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally.  The brilliant, and I mean brilliant, performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed, not only by audiences, but by the Academy and by most of the critics.I think I know why.  First, the plot--or actually just the setup--is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit.  Their names even begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia--Rose, Ginny, and Caroline.  And I guess ""Larry"" (Jason Robards) works for ""Lear.""  The apparent idea envisioned by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize winning novel was to tell a Lear-like story from the point of view of the daughters, and to tell it in a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the Bard.  The problem is, in Smiley and Moorhouse's story, the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities.  His only strength is his ability to make a financial success of the farm; however, we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it.The second problem--and this is one I cannot personally attest to, not having read Smiley's novel--is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel.  Still, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen.  The vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints don't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist.  Given five or six hours, perhaps Moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with Smiley's novel.A third problem is one that is perhaps Moorhouse's alone.  She began her directing career with the very well done Aussie film Proof (1991) starring Russell Crowe.  She follow it up with How to Make an American Quilt (1995) which celebrated women, especially women of a certain age.  However it was a bit heavy-handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick.  In a sense A Thousand Acres takes off from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some.  Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad daddy. He beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them.  He ran the household with an iron fist.  Jess (Colin Firth's character) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear.  And then he goes to Rose, who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership, and hooks up with her, while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident.  The rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance, the way they often appear in romance novels.  I think most audiences were put off by the heavy-handed incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story.Having said all this, I think the critics and the public are wrong.  I think the direction was biased against men, but in this story it needed to be.  I think Moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty.  And the acting by Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational.  They seemed to feed off of one another in a way that I found absolutely authentic and deeply moving.  In particular Pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent-up anger and hatred.  The way Moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to Pfeiffer's outstanding performance.  And the skill with which Moorhouse guided the change in Ginny's character as she went from a ""ninny,"" as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent.  The fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else.  He needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back.  And Robards in his intensity and madness was also very good.I predict that this film, which bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on DVD.  My question is, whatever happened to Moorhouse?  Her talent is obvious, but she has yet to director her fourth feature film.  When she does I hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well.  I think, actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film, but didn't pay enough attention to the others.  In addition to the unnuanced father, Jennifer Jason Leigh's Caroline was unfinished, leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did.  And the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins.  They needed to be engaged and involved.",N/A

The first season is our favorite, the second is next.  As a mother to a ten year old girl, I got some good ideas about how to handle my child, and she got to see how good parents handle situations.  There are some issues that came up in episodes that I never thought to discuss with my daughter, and so it was perfect for us to watch together.  One issue per episode is shown from different points of view at the different levels of the family members -it gets one thinking.  There is a bit of emphasis on dating, but that's probably what keeps people of all ages watching and it's done tastefully.  These seasons have been enjoyable for our whole family.",N/A

336983,"like its original soundtrack, ""swing kids"" is a fine example of a movie replete with swing music, swing moves and swing kids...it tells the story of four friends caught in the middle of world war II. only in their teens, these friends were forced to choose between loyalty to their government and frindship.  they are forced to face situations unbreable for their age.  luckily, there was the american swing music they could count on. but alas, even that was banned by hitler and mused nationality among the young germans.  forced to go underground, these rebels called themselves swing kids in protest to what is happening around them.the story revolved around four friends who had to make a difficult choice - enjoy swing music or be one of hitler's followers. what ensued was the most dramatic scenes strongly molded on friendship - a sensitive subject.the situations presented were so real, the acting was excellent (christian bale and robert sean leonard) that you could actually feel what they are talking about.  even the supporting cast, barbara hershey and kenneth branagh in uncredited role were superb.the music by james horner (pre-titanic) is also good. but one of the real stars of the show was the swing music draped all over the movie.i bought a lot of swing cd's that time because of this movie before i got the original soundtrack. whew, i felt good watching the movie and listening to the music...buy it if you are interested in swing music or a movie on friendship and bits and pieces of world war II atrocities.this is one great movie...",N/A
797091,"Shona & Rebecca wrote great reviews. I can add just my 2 cents that at first I hated this since the music was soft, ambient, lullaby style which can ruin any good workout. Even though the stage was empty except her, the music added to the sleep inducing slow start of posture & muscle alignment & easy step & turn leg preliminary ballet footwork practice.The workout perked me up when she added leg lifts & circles that help improve balance & more of a stylish routine ballet footwork that she does several times so you do get it even w/o lengthy verbal cues. I was pleasantly surprised when she said ""ballet doesn't have to be rigid"" & added some hip bumps & circles & then went on to slightly funk jazz steps & grapevines. At this point her teaching style, positiveness & joy for dancing & body awareness allowed me to ignore the too slow/soft music.The 5 minute bar work was short & sweet with stretching the legs at the bar & more balance work holding leg lifts behind you & in front.The mat work was all stretching & pilates toning of the abs & legs. The pace was surprisingly faster considering the slow pace of the dancing. There's a lot of leg lifts to tone the legs, ab crunches/bicycle & very good deep stretches, not much traditional yoga poses except for wide leg, single leg & straight leg forward bends, bridge, supine spinal twists, butterfly & child's pose.I felt more stretched out in a long time & energized & more then from some yoga videos because her stretches were different. This video really helped me to become aware of my body better then most workouts including many yoga ones or Jennifer Kries ""hot body cool mind."" At first I was a little sore & thought I overdid the stretches, but the next day I felt very lose/flexible like I already did yoga when I woke up & when did pilates later that day, tight tendons that rub/pull on joints in my lower back/hips/knees that keep me from certain movements (leg lifts, etc.) for YEARS were NOT a problem. I could do movements I couldn't do before since poor body mechanics using gym weights & overdoing some yoga salutaions years ago & over tightening those joints. I'm SOOOO happy!Stephanie Herman has been a prima ballerina for 10 years, She still has beautiful grace & awesome body awareness that can help you to be in more touch with your own body. Her teaching style is quick to the point, she knows her anatomy & how each muscle pulls another body part, how it feels & says it well with analogies. Her positiveness & joy for dancing & body awareness is beautiful to watch. Her teaching is very soft but strong & patient. You can see she loves teaching & it's perfect for her. Her grace from being a prima ballarina is gorgeous to look at.This video is for therapeutic, stretching & body awareness, not cardio or hard toning. This video is great for light days when you don't want to exercise or afraid to start & be too tired to finish. This video will energize you to increase your energy to want to workout more or improve your mood for the day.UPDATE: After renting her Artistry of Fitness & her Dance with me: Jazz workout, I realized she uses the exact same mat workout on her Jazz dvd. The music on her Jazz dvd is much more livelier, but the basic idea of the moves is exactly the same. Which is all from her Espirit da Danse from her Artistry of Fitness DVD. The ballet has 33 min of slower paced music, but great ballet moves & bar. This Jazz one is is 38 min dance & has GREAT music & quicker pace. The jazz one has some moves from the Espirit De Danse, the ballet has others. The matwork on the Ballet & Jazz is better then the one on her Artistry of Fitness. All had too many repetitions of the same dance moves. I love her spirit & style, I just wish she would condense everything into 1 great dvd & also make another with strictly ballet moves.",N/A
454682,"This review is not regarding the actual film itself, but rather the poor quality of this DVD release.The transfer used on this ""25th Anniversary Edition"" DVD is of VHS quality.

218937,"Okay, so much for my weak attempt at humor.  In all seriousness, this is a classic film which is likely to be different than anything you've viewed before. Originally to be set up as a contest between the North American Blackfoot Indians and John Colter in Wyoming, it was filmed in Africa instead for financial reasons. This was a real story in which Colter evaded his pursuers for 11 days in a run for Fort Raymond.Basics of the (film) story are:Group of white ivory hunters leave British fort with their native bearers in search of elephant tusks. I say to myself, ""self, this is another safari film.""A hunting party (scouting party?) of local natives meet the safari and want gifts for their chief in exchange for passage through their lands. Safari guide, Cornel Wilde (the man), wants to oblige them, however the leader of the safari refuses, saying the goods he is carrying are for trading for ivory, not to be used as handouts to every native beggar who comes along and pushes the native leader aside. Big mistake.White hunters find elephants and massacre the herd. The bearers are removing the tusks and some of the meat while the white hunters clean their weapons and relax around the campfire. Native hunting party has followed and is watching from the bushes.Native party attacks the safari and, after a brief fight, captures or kills the safari. The surviving safari members are taken to the hunter's village where the jealously guarded goods for trade are pillaged by the locals under the grinning guise of the chief as the white hunters watch.Native court is set up and each of the members is sentenced (to death in some gristly, unique fashion) by the chief among the cheers of the village. When at last Cornel is to be sentenced, the leader of the hunting party speaks briefly to the chief of his wanting to pay the tribute earlier. This earns the Man a chance to live.The natives fire an arrow into the distance. The Man is stripped naked and set to run towards the arrow. A group of hunters are ready to pursue (one by one as each passes the arrow) when the Man reaches the arrow.The first native hunter is off and pursues the Man, tossing his javelin and barely missing his target. The man takes up the javelin and kills the hunter ... taking his clothing, food and weapons.  At this point the movie settles into the chase. A group of pissed off natives, expert hunters and trackers all, and the solitary white man. The man evades his tormentors through the chase, sometimes narrowly and eventually makes his way back to the British holding.I venture to say that much of the success of the film was because it was shot in Africa. Had it held true to the actual chase in 1808 in America, it would be just one more Indian/white man movie. As it is, this is unique.Shot with beautiful panoramic views of the landscape and interlaced with the day to day doings of the wildlife in the savannah, this film offers a magnificent view of the dark continent ... free of the common themes and cliches of other African stories. One will note that there is no Hollywood style background music in the movie at all. All background music is authentic African songs and drums. This lends authenticity to the film and contributes to its uniqueness. Dialogue is minimal after the initial safari sequence, consisting mainly of short conversations between members of the hunting group chasing the Man. Dialogue is in the native language (with no subtitles) so you can't understand the words, but the meaning of what is being said is very clear through expressions and gestures.This is a gem of a film which will please anyone who enjoys the outdoorsy adventure kind of story presented. If you like stories about Africa, so much the better. Unfortunately, this has never been released on DVD and the video is out of print. So choices are limited to finding a used copy of the tape or trying to catch the movie on TV. I have a worn copy I made from a television showing some twenty years ago and would certainly welcome the crispness available on today's digital medium.The film is not overly bloody (though there is a little), but might be disturbing to the younger set. I would think that most children seven and up can handle it without any dreams that night. Very young children will probably not know what's going on and will more than likely not be interested in the movie.A very adult movie with an adult theme which I highly recommend.~P~",Naked Prey VHS

116199,"It is the movie that set new standards in the world of movie making.  Terminator 2 did it in 1990, and the Matrix took it to the next level in 1999.  Other films, such as Romeo Must Die, have tried to duplicate these wonderful effects, but have come up short.  Not only is the Matrix a first in superb visuals and animation, but it is a dang good movie too.If you haven't heard of the Matrix yet, this first installment explains everything.  It might take a few viewings to understand every nook, but once it all fits into place it is a great theme, ""is this world we live in real, or not, and what exactly defines ""real"".  The Matrix will explain it all, in the eyes of Neo (aka Mr. Anderson as Agen Smith likes to call him), from his simple days as another man in the Matrix to becoming unplugged and becoming ""The One"".The story is great.  The characters are top notch and the visuals are to die for.  Many even place this movie into martial arts category, as each fight scene displays true martial arts choreogrpahy intertwined with visual effects of animation.  Truly though, the Matrix is a sc-fi action blast.  Although there is the R rating, I have seen PG-13 films with more questionable content that this film.  Most teenagers and above should be suitable for this.Arguably the best in the trilogy, The Matrix is in my opinion that compared to the other two.  Be sure to watch Reloaded and Revolutions, though not as good in story, the visuals are simplying mind-blowing, only expanding on what the first installment created.",N/A

996313,"The second Voltron collection celebrates the orange-clad Hunk and his blue-eyed Yellow Lion.  Inside the super neat-O tin case is another set of three DVDs on an attractive but inconvenient folding cardboard holder with a terrific illustration of Zarkon and Haggar on the back.  Overall, the episodes here are substantially better than the ones on the first set.  Although many of the plots employ the usual Witch Haggar Robeast formula, they don't seem quite as repetitious now thanks to the addition of Zarkon's endearingly-evil son, Lotor, and a few new planets (Pollux, Lyra and Tyrus), minor characters (Farla, Romelle and Bandor) and Voltron weapons (the Electro Saber and the Argon Force Field).  Like theBlue Lion Collection, these discs contain a total of fifteen adventures, including these exciting classics:""My Brother's a Robeast"": The sinister King Kova, warmongering ruler of Planet Pollux, meets with Zarkon to request that his son, Prince Avok, be transformed into a Robeast so he can crush the indomitable Voltron.  With the linking lions out of the way, Kova and Zarkon will finally be able to conquer peaceful Planet Arus and divide it between them.  Since the freckle-faced Avok is Pollux's greatest warrior, his scheming father is certain that rotten old Witch Haggar can easily mold him into the most awesomely powerful monster in the galaxy.  First, though, the pugnacious Prince must defeat Zarkon's white-haired son, Lotor, in the infamous fighting arena.  This shouldn't be too difficult to do, as Lotor is so busy staring at the beautiful blonde in the audience that he can't keep his mind on the duel.  She is Prince Avok's loyal sister, Romelle...but why does she look so much like Princess Allura?""The Buried Castle"": Three chubby children are hiking through the lush Arusian woods when a spooky old fortress mysteriously rises from the ground beyond the trees.  Fearlessly, the young explorers approach the ominous structure as lightning bolts crackle in the sky.  They are soon joined by Pidge and one of the Princess' colorful rodent friends.  The diminutive adventurers cross the wind-whipped castle's doorstep and make their way to the treasure room.  Suddenly, bony fingers pierce the creaky floorboards and seize their tiny ankles!""The Deadly Flowers"": Strange pink and yellow seed pods rain down on Arus and quickly bloom into fragrant flowers.  Initially, the planet's citizens are thrilled with the vast fields of pretty posies that carpet the Arusian landscape...but they soon find themselves gasping for breath before falling flat on their faces!  The only antidote for the devastating flower-bourn illness is found on Lyra, a planet known to have a strong magnetic pull that renders robotic lions inoperable.  Fortunately, Lyra's mighty magnetism is neutralized by water, and the Blue Lion was specifically designed to be driven underwater.  Unfortunately, Princess Allura, the Blue Lion's pilot, was among those sickened by the aromatic blossoms.""Raid of the Alien Mice"": Princess Allura wishes for peace while stargazing from her picture window in the Castle of Lions.  Instead, she gets a metal-munching army of fang-faced purple space vermin, sent from Planet Doom by the haggish Witch Haggar (who else?).  It's up to Chitter and his lovable pastel-painted mice pals to stop their vicious alien cousins before they gnaw through the wires that power the Voltron Force's main computer.  Meanwhile, a serpent-headed Robeast with very broad shoulders has landed outside!""Short Run of the Centipede Express"": While Zarkon's multi-legged spacecraft soars threateningly through the cosmos, the intrepid Voltron Force navigates the treacherous meteorite fields surrounding Planet Moura, where Lotor's latest ultimate weapon, the Doomsday Gun, is under construction.  Simultaneously, within the dark towers of Castle Doom, the lilac-skinned Prince is punishing his disobedient slaves with the help of a carnivorous alligator-man with an extra eyeball embedded in his scaly neck.""The Treasure of Planet Tyrus"": Inside a hideous skull-faced fortress on Planet Tyrus, the cleanly Witch Haggar bathes her blue feline friend in soap bubbles and tomato-red lava liquid while Prince Lotor begins his annual birthday celebration with a relaxing massage from three lovely slave girls.  Little does the Spock-eared birthday boy know that the Voltron Force is nearby, aboard a damaged treasure ship bound for Tyrus, admiring the gigantic solid gold statue sent by dear old Dad, King Zarkon.The Special Features this time around consist of: ""Viva Voltron,"" a music video by the masked electric guitarist, Buckethead, who is known for his KFC headwear; and a featurette entitled, ""International Voltron,"" which includes the original Japanese opening and closing songs from GoLion, plus the French Voltron theme.

1004742,"By 1974 Amando de Ossario's Blind Dead films seemed to be in a rut. The release of The Ghost Galleon (Horror of the Zombies in America) did nothing to help the series'eventual demise. What started out as a fairly interesting concept had collapsed under its own weight.The Blind Dead Knight's Templar are back but now they exist in another dimension upon a forever floating ghost ship. The plotting is fairly non-existent. Two models are set adrift on a boat in the major shipping channel by sports equipment tycoon Howard Tucker (Jack Taylor) as a publicity stunt to draw attention to his new water craft. The two girls drift into a mysterious fog and see an ancient floating galleon. This galleon promptly crashes into them. One of the models (Margarita Merino, in an uncredited role) boards the ship rather than stay in her own boat. That night screams are heard and she is never seen again. Her model partner Kathy (Blanca Estrada) follows her friend onto the galleon finding that the Blind Dead are on board who rapidly turn her into zombie dinner.Thrown into the mix are a would be rescue squad led by Tucker. The group also includes Nomei (Barbara Rey) with whom Kathy may have been having a lesbian affair, Kathy and Nomei's employer Lillian (Maria Perschy), a seemingly lost Professor, and Sergei, Tucker's henchman bodyguard. What follows is fairly predictable with the zombies killing off each one of the rescuers as the film progresses.The Blue Underground disc features both Spanish and English audio. On this film I opted for the English. The picture quality is very good considering the source material. The viewer should be aware that much of the film is dark and very foggy so clarity is a major issue.The story as I alluded to is pretty bland. The acting is adequate for a B movie of this type. Performances are generally wooden. The model work is very dated. If you watch carefully at the end of the film you will easily notice problems with the scale of the ship as compared to the ocean it is floating in. On the horror level the film is fairly non gory and except for one or two instances of blood there is no offensive violence. Unlike the first two films the nudity in this outing is nonexistent.This is worth a viewing for the Ossario completest but is generally not worth seeking out otherwise. The disc also contains the original theatrical trailer, promotional materials for its American release as Horror of the Zombies, and a stills gallery.",The Ghost Galleon

783778,"I am hesitant to classify ""Father Ted"" as a Brit-Com, as it is primarily Irish actors and set on the Emerald Isle.  It was a BBC offering, though, so one can apply that label if desired.  I, personally, prefer to think of Father Ted as a comedy for the world, especially those that don't mind jibes towards the religious community.Unfortunately, Dermot Morgan, who plays the title role, died a day after the last episode was filmed.  Doubtless, there would have been many more seasons of this outstanding and absolutely hilarious series.  Fortunately, we are left with this great set of the complete season, a living memorial of an amazing comedic actor.  It certainly helps that Ardal O'Hanlan (from more recent 'My Hero' fame) plays the increasingly empty-headed assistant to Father Ted.  The rest of the cast round out brilliantly, and guest appearances (including Graham Norton on two episodes) add to the amazing acting throughout the series.Set on Craggy Island just off the west coast of Ireland, the three priests fight off boredom, competing parishes, strange allegations, and religious oppression (strange, I know) in all manner of zany circumstances.  It is part visual humor, part slapstick (light on that front, thankfully), part dialogue/verbal humor, and mostly situational hilarity and parody of itself.If you are very sensitive to religious issues, specifically mockery of the Catholic Church, then this series is not for you.  While all done in good-natured fun, it does take many shots at the Church from the Vatican all the way down to the lay community.  If you are open-minded to such jokes, or if you are merely a fan of britcoms, Irish humor, religious humor, Dermot Morgan, Ardal O'Hanlan, sitcoms, or any similar genre, then this is a must-own DVD.  You will be laughing hysterically, I assure you!(Also, the DVD quality is nigh perfect.  There aren't an extremely large number of special features, but there are enough to round out the DVDs and the episodes have a high level of replay value).",N/A
922908,"I only saw one reviewer mention the VHS but, for some reason they failed to mention the following....the DVD is incomplete!!!Like some of the other reviewers, I was really looking forward to this being released on DVD. I bought the VHS way back in 1983(so old it's in mono!!!) and was greatly looking forward to hearing the musical performances in 5.1!But....lo & behold... this isn't the entire VHS that was originally released!!! And among the missing parts is THE major reason I was looking forward to the DVD - the single greatest Blues Brothers performance (in my opinion)....B Movie Boxcar Blues!!! I was so disgusted that I have yet to do a skit by skit comparison so am not sure what else is missing but I am certain some comedy skits are missing as well.I also soon realized that there are many new skits as well and one of them is the Samurai Night Fever skit with OJ Simpson. Since this wasn't on the original VHS it can only be an editing decision made after the OJ fiasco. As another reviewer noted, we definitely could have done without this skit and I hope OJ didn't get any proceeds from its addition. In fact the only reason I can think of for its inclusion is the demand for more Samurai skits. But they could have picked from many others, the 2 skits with Frank Zappa conducting his band & The Samurai musician are both priceless and rarely aired.Also, I agree with the reviewer who stated there are better Joe Cocker skits too. In addition to the one mentioned with Joe himself, there is also a hilarious skit with Belushi doing his impersonation along side a female singer (I forget who....Ann Margaret?) and she ends up laughing so hard she can't finish the song!!Bottom line....if you are a fan of Belushi by all means get this!! I only wish it contained ALL the material from the VHS. I guess I'll have to wait on the appropriate season DVD box set (or get the Blues Brothers DVD) to get my beloved B Movie Boxcar Blues in 5.1 hi-fi!!",SNL - Best of John Belushi

563630,"I loved this film (I have the VHS version) for numerous reasons: it was in good, bright color, it wasn't too hokey, the cinematography was brilliant, and, most of all, I really like The Lone Ranger. The larger theme here is, of course, the struggle between good and evil (good wins) and the actual story sort of focuses on the bad treatment of Indians by rotten local whites, especially by the evil local sheriff. The Indians are in a poverty plight and, if The Lost City of Gold could be located by the tribe, their situation would be alleviated.There's plenty of action and the locations are just tops.

931985,"Okay, here goes.  These orphans, who all look to be in their twenties decide to escape from the cruel orphanage.  They work out this clever plan.  The clever plan?  Get out of bed and walk out the unlocked door then wait for the security guard to come out and beat him to death so they can then walk away. Yeah, that was clever.  So they escape the orphange and they go into the woods where there is this book, passed down from the Druids.  So they won't be caught and returned to the orphange, (even though they are all old enough to be holding down real jobs), they commit mass suicide, using some Druid spell, so that they can come back some time in the future when some unsuspecting souls wander into the woods and step into their magic circle.  One guy and I have no idea where he came from, becomes the guardian of the circle and it is his destiny to defend the circle and make sure no one ever goes into the circle and be possessed by the orphans.  So what does he do to make sure no one ever steps into the circle by accident?  He builds a wall around it.  Unfortunately, the wall is only about one inch high.  Really..I'm not making this up.  So a group of hikers (woo-hoo! unsuspecting souls)wander into the woods and all but one of them walks or trips or stumbles into the circle (I'm having trouble going on because this is so stupid) and they become possessed by the deceased orphans.  The guardian, who was apparently sleeping on the job when this happens, decides he has to hunt down the now possessed people and destroy them to protect the Earth.  He enlists the aid of the one guy from the hiker group who was not possessed to help. (And this guy is dumber than dirt) The guardian and the idiot hiker guy then enlist the aid of some young woman who is just a random friend of the guardian.  So how do you track down these demons from the pit?  I guess the plan was just to run in mindless panic, hiding in stupid places and hoping the demons find you, which they did with incredible ease.  So after the demon orphans, one by one, never as a group find our three heroes, they are then dispatched by the guardian's secret weapon.  Again, I'm not making this up.  Now when I'm fighting demons, my arsenal consists of things like holy water, wooden stakes and silver bullets.  A nice sharp sword that might behead one of the demons might come in handy too.  Maybe carry a small Bible in a pocket.  What does our hero use?  A shovel he gets from a hardware store.  With his trusty shovel, Excaliber, he beats the demons back to the burning pit. The only thing worse than the plot of this mess is the acting by an entire cast, and particularly the guardian guy.  I have never seen such horrible acting.  This guy should be the poster boy for bad acting.  If you don't pay attention in drama class, this could be you.  Anyway, if you want to see some incredibly bad acting in a movie that makes absolutely no sense at all with poor make-up and terrible camera work, this might be for you.",N/A
516164,"I really wanted this movie to be great. I really felt that it had the potential. And you know, it started out pretty good. But the longer the movie goes the weaker it got. It was almost like they started with half a script and when theu got to the end of that they just winged the rest.The premise of the film is that a gang called the rebels had pretty much taken over the streets of this urban Indiania neighborhood. They are extremely bad and horrifically violent and refuse to let anyone get in their way. One citizen see's one of the gang kill a high school basketball star and calls the cops. The gang retailiates by trashing his store, beating him up, shooting him, and leaving him for dead. Enter John Bookman.Bookman (Fred Williamson) is the son of the shop owner, an ex-NFL football star, and, it turns out, the original leader of the rebels some 30 years ago. He returns home to find a war zone. After failing to start a dialog with the gang with the help of the local preacher (Paul Winfield) he turns to his old comrads-in-arms to try and take back the streets.Joined by his best friend from the gang days (Jim Brown), who has his own demons to over come (the son he never knew had just been killed by the gang) they begin to orchestrate a neighborhood revolt. Joining them is Brown's old girlfriend and the mother of his son (Pam Grier), and a couple of ex-gang members (Richard Roundtree, Ron O'Neal).Here is where the problems begin for this movie. After this great set-up it starts to deteriorate into just pure violence. A previous reviewer says this movie has a ""deep message."" What's the message, that you have to become as vicious and brutal as the gang you're trying to stop? We see people being executed with a bullet to the brain, burned, having their necks snapped, knifed, beaten with baseball bats, and just gunned down in a all-out hail of gunfire. As the heroes continue their onslaught we see that in the end, they really are no less violent and brutal as the gang. In the final scenes we find Williamson & Brown in a fight with the two current gang leaders while a rival gang looks on. Once they dispose of the hoodlums finally the police, missing completely during the firefight, show up. What started out good ended silly. What a shame.I would recommend this only to those who are either into Blaxploitation movies or if you have about 100 minutes to kill. Not bad but just could have been SO much better",N/A

Never in my entire life have I cried for so long and so hard during a movie.  No movie has ever affected me this way.Many of us remember that morning so vividly. September 11th, 2001.  I really wasn't sure if I wanted to see the film.  I remember watching the TV, glued to it, for answers to the questions that I never will have answered as to how something so horrible could happen. This film doesn't attempt to try to answer that question, instead it looks at the spirit of people and how we can come together to help others.I am so glad I decided to see this! It is a powerful work of film that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. It's a film of last words and feelings we tend to develop after years in a relationship. There are tears of joy, laughs, and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this film with strong acting from a huge cast.I highly recommend this film although it may certainly be tough for those who lost loved ones in the buildings.",N/A

1104805,"VITUS is a film from Switzerland that has garnered many accolades and nearly won an Oscar.  And yes, it is that good!  Written by Fredi M. Murer, Peter Luisi, and Lukas B. Suter and directed by Murer, VITUS explores the life of a child genius, a lad who from the age of five is obviously gifted in that he can play Bach et al after only a few months lessons and is able to read books and understand concepts that make his stance in a regular kindergarten class untenable.  But the film is less about the gifts of a child prodigy than it is a story of how a genius child longs for a normal childhood.  It is in the telling of the story that the audience is privileged to discover the joys and trials in a child's view of being extraordinary.Vitus - played at age 6 by Fabrizio Borsani and at age 12 by Teo Gheorghiu - is referred to as a little Mozart by his parents Helen (Julika Jenkins) and Leo (Urs Jucker), and by the family friends who are amazed at Vitus' gift as a pianist.  But as is often the case with gifted children, they are overprotected, not allowed to engage in the normal activities of being a kid.  Vitus finds consolation in his grandfather (a brilliant Bruno Ganz) whose creative energy includes Vitus in his longing to fly and to build complex machines.  While Vitus continues his love for the piano he also takes risks with his beloved grandfather.  Vitus' intelligence serves him well in analyzing the complexities of his father's job and his grandfather's role in that position, and it is his genius that leads the family in a direction no one thought possible.  And of course with every story of an extraordinary young lad adapting to a puzzling world, there is also a love interest: Isabel at age 12 (Kristina Lykowa) is his fun-loving babysitter and at age 19 (Tamara Scarpellini) is the queen of his inexperienced heart and fill a void in Vitus' life that otherwise would be empty.  Fitting all of these subplots together is made magical by Vitus' constant playing of classical music - a feat the young actor is capable of performing on his own!The cast of this film is not only gifted but is also endearing.  Bruno Ganz is a brilliant actor and he is matched by both of the young actors who play Vitus.  The story is tender but avoids bathos. It simply is an uplifting, inspiring, entertaining film.

27038,"Released the same year as ""Psycho"" and offering many parallels, it's mystifying that Hitchcock's film was a hit, Powell's a fiasco. There is a claustrophobic immediacy to ""Tom"" that ""Psycho"" lacks- the film's in color and has a documentary feel, which may have hit 1960 viewers too close to home. Also, critics expected murder and mayhem from Hitchcock, not from the fabled director of ""The Red Shoes"". That aside, director Powell lived long enough to see his film vindicated with audiences and critics twenty years later, when friend Martin Scorsese oversaw its re-issue. ""Tom"" stands up as a virtual masterpiece of psychological horror, with Boehm bloodless and creepy in the title role, and Powell's inspired camera-work putting the viewer uncomfortably close to the wrong side of Mark's camera. A subtly perverse treat for horror and thriller devotees.",N/A
1129836,"I'm in no way saying that this story is a masterpiece. It isn't. The acting is inconsistent, ranging from the best with the two regulars, Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant, (in a desparate bid to carry the story) to the worst with the actress playing Vena, who looks like she's being forced at gunpoint to do this, reading nearly every line in a monotone,  the story ending is a cop-out (""I'll explain later"" the Doctor says, when Peri asks him how he survived the Bandril's missile), and yes, the some of the set looks unusually cheap (But why should the last thing be a massive issue?)Why do I like it so much then?The whole H.G. Wells storyline is a massive plus for the story in my view. Every time I watch Timelash, I found my interest hitting high-gear. Just putting the naive, spirit-mad, writer wannabe young H.G.Wells before he became famous with the most angry, aggressive-eccentric, moody Doctor, and BAM! Fireworks.Also deserving a mention is the Borad. Most reviews I've found for the VHS release I've seen just lump every part of this story in the ""Horrible"" category, but the Borad has to be one of the most well-realised monsters of the classic era, done so well on a small budget, like Colin says on the commentary, it's like a trick camera profile, with one side human, and one side Borad, and the two meld in to make it a VERY convincing monster. The scenes between the Doctor and the Borad are easily a highlight of the storyAll in all, have another watch on DVD. Buy Timelash, Grab a beer, pizza, whatever, sit down on the couch, empty your mind of 2000's special effects, and enjoy.

349068,"The other reviews here seem to be about some individual movie. I'm reviewing the United Artists Super Deluxe Gift Set.Warner Home Video has put out these giant megasets before, and now United Artists is doing the same thing. However, United Artists has less boxed sets on the market than Warner does, so your chances of double dipping are less in this collection. However, there is some danger of double dips. In particular United Artists has best picture collections, musical collections, Woody Allen collections, and James Bond collections that all duplicate movies in this bunch. On the bright side, for the films that have double disc editions, that is what they are offering, also the total price works out to a little under six dollars per disc, which is not bad. Do remember though, in single disc editions, United Artists/MGM seldom put any extras in with their movies. The highlights of this collection are:1. 5 James Bond films - On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me, The Living Daylights, Goldeneye, Dr. No2. Best Picture winners - Marty (1955), The Apartment (1960), West Side Story (Widescreen, 2-Disc) 1961, In the Heat of the Night (1967), Midnight Cowboy - 2-Disc (1969), Rocky- 2 Disc Edition (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Rain Man (1988)3. Some classic Spencer Tracy performances - ""Judgement at Nuremburg"", ""Inherit the Wind"", ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World""4. Some classic noir in ""Woman in the Window"", ""The Killing"", and ""Night of the Hunter"".5. Many other classic films such as ""The Defiant Ones"", ""The Miracle Worker"", ""Good, Bad, and the Ugly"" 2 Disc edition, ""Birdman of Alcatraz"", ""Elmer Gantry"", and ""I Want To Live"" among others.There is some junk hiding among the classics -""The Man in the Iron Mask"" - Not DiCaprio's finest hour and obviously made just to capitalize on his power to draw teenage girls to the box office shortly after his Titanic fame.""Road House"" - 1989 film that is the stuff adolescent male dreams are made of - beautiful girls that fall for drifters and a chance to be macho and get paid for it.""Heaven's Gate"" - A long expensive boring 1980 western that led United Artists into bankruptcy. For a studio to start with Mary Pickford and Charles Chaplin and to end up here...oh the agony.Overall this package consists largely of both old and modern classics with just a few junk movies thrown in. You have to expect that, how else is United Artists going to get anyone to buy the last three films I mentioned? Overall, a very good buy if you can afford it and if you haven't double-dipped too much in other collections already.",UA Prestige Collection

1069577,"I think this collection might be my favorite television DVD collection out there. Sure, i love ""The Simpsons"" and ""Seinfeld,"" but I can catch those in syndication on a regular basis. However, I haven't seen Woody Woodpecker and Friends since I was a kid, and this collection constitutes one of the best samplings out there, in my humble opinion.The collection consists of 3 strong DVD's, with loads of Woody. Out of the 75 collected ""cartunes,"" 45 feature the red-headed instigator in some of his wackiest hijinks. As a kid, I always thought the early ones were the best, and while Woody is pretty ugly in his debut (and first couple of episodes), nonetheless he is at his side-splitting best. You get healthy doses of Wally Walrus (my favorite Woody foil), and Buzz Buzzard (another favorite), together with a smattering of other characters (Andy Panda, whom I never really cared for, makes a couple of appearances in the ""Woody"" features, for example).In addition to the Woody cartoons, the viewer is also treated to some of the other ""Cartune"" favorites, such as the ""Oswald the Rabbit,"" ""Andy Panda,"" ""Chilly Willy,"" ""Swing symphonies"" and others that don't really have a characterization. These are a mixed bag - I was never really a fan of Andy, although I enjoyed his cartoons presented here. I love Chilly Willy, but Oswald really did nothing for me. As a kid, I always hated the non-character-related ""cartunes,"" and here is no exception. Of course, this is a matter of personal preference, but I feel the ""Swing Symphonies"" and the generic ""Cartunes"" are of a lower quality all-around. Thankfully, this only makes up 15 total cartoons, and a couple of these ARE watchable (I actually liked ""Crazy mixed-up pup""). I am still amazed that somehow, Siam (Thailand) is considered an Arab nation, judging by the costumes of the characters, but what are you going to do?I am sad that some (well, all, but it really shows in some cases) of the cartoons weren't restored - there is a definite change in sound and visual quality from 'Tune to 'Tune. I love some of the ""plots"" present (in one of my all-time favorites, Woody poses as the baby boy of Wally Walrus. Wally then tortures his son with a ""comeback ball,"" before deciding to do away with him via dynamite).I enjoyed most of the extras on this set. I was particularly pleased with the late Walt Lantz show telling the story of his origin. He claims to have created the technique of combining live action with animation, and also has absolutely no sense of a timeline (he claims that a cartoon he wrote regarding confidence and the Great Depression led to a job offer - in 1929. Hmmmm). The lone stinker of the bunch was the Woody Halloween episode - it just doesn't have the ""oomph"" of the other episodes!Nonetheless, the flaws mentioned are slight. I am overjoyed at this collection, and look forward to future ones! Huh huh huh huh huh!",The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection
172360,"`Brokeback Mountain' will stand the tests of time, for that I'm certain.  Many would argue that it's only because of it's taboo subject matter or controversy but in the end, after the dust has settled and the smoke has cleared `Brokeback Mountain' is more than just a superlative talking point, it's a monumental powerhouse of a motion picture, from it's brilliant script to it's earth shattering acting to it's award winning directing.  At it's very core `Brokeback Mountain' is a story about life as we see it, live it and need it and it reaches to the heartstrings of much more than would be expected.  This is far deeper than `gay cinema' as some have labeled it but is modern cinema at its finest and teaches valid and life changing points that everyone can learn from despite their orientation and or morality.The film, based of Annie Proulx's short story, centers around the lives of two sheepherders Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  The two meet when they are but eighteen, Ennis engaged to his sweetheart Alma and Jack just trying to find himself.  They spend the summer together on Brokeback Mountain, herding sheep and albeit unintentionally falling in love.  The film setting begins in the early sixties and advancing twenty-some-odd-years before its conclusion and throughout the notion of repressed sexual feelings it made apparent. It's not culturally acceptable for these two men to even entertain the idea of loving and or being together, and so after their summer-long affair they go their separate ways, Ennis to marry Alma and Jack to eventually find and fall for Lureen.  Years later, after the births of their children, the memory of their affair still plagues them, not in regret of action but in regret of leaving it alone for so long and so they start up again, rekindling a flame that could only end in tragedy.The film is less a `gay love story' and more a universal cry for love in the most complex of terms.  This film proves that you can't pick the one you love but that the thoughts and feelings of those around us, whether it be close family, friends or the idea of a culture in whole can and will affect our decisions to whom and how to love.  While I feel that Jack Twist's character is and was a homosexual man I feel that Ennis was more or less a man you found love in a place he least expected it.  He never sought after the attention of other men as Jack did.  In fact even after Alma leaves him he still seeks the affection of a woman, but Jack and Jack alone had stolen his heart.  That's what's so moving and inspiring about this film is that it parades the truth that love is love and one must embrace that love of lose all happiness they could ever know.What helps elevate this film so far above the competition is the brilliant acting on the entire cast, a cast of young talented stars who blew up in such a big way by taking on such a mature film.  Looking at the roster one may not believe they could handle the material but everyone involved is stellar.  Ledger plays Ennis with such restraint and precise confusion that one is brought to tears almost as much for Ledgers star turn as he is for the tragedy wrapped within his character.  Ledger creates a performance that stays with you.  Gyllenhaal also manages to brilliantly create a character we can relate to.  Jack Twist is someone we know and maybe even a little bit of each of us, a man who just wants to live his life and doesn't care what the consequences.  Death to him is a fair enough price to pay for freedom.  Michelle Williams is a revelation as Alma, her pain, her subtle emotion, her breakdown and her silently unraveling sanity is as moving as it is astonishing to watch.  Anne Hathaway, while not receiving the critical attention of her co-stars delivers a brilliant performance and deserves to be recognized.  Her performance as Lureen may not have been as baity as the character given to Williams, but she maneuvers her character through her scenes with a maturity that she is recently blossoming into.Visually stunning and emotionally captivating `Brokeback Mountain' is a movie that demands to be seen and taken seriously and is one that will stay with the viewer for years even decades to come.  We feel the pain in Ennis' gut as he falls to his knees in despair over leaving Jack.  We feel the torment in Alma's eyes as she watches the man she loves embrace another man.  We feel the frustration in Jack's demeanor as he pleads for Ennis to stay with him, give him anything more than an annual escapade.  But most of all we feel our own heart breaking and setting as we realize how this film and it's very essence effect us in ways we'd never imagine.  Gay, straight, male or female we have all met our Ennis or Jack and maybe even let him or her go because of outside influence or confusion of heart.  May this tragic tale of love denied and love lost move us to never let that happen to us again.",N/A

It was at this Rumble where the stipulation of ""winner gets the WWE Championship title shot at WrestleMania"" was put into play that is still continued to this day that featured such highlights as the first two men which would be considered a dream match for long time WWE & NWA/WCW fans, a new record set, past & current rivalries revisited, who decided to make their first impression on Undertaker, ""every man for himself"" coming into play between former tag team championship partners, and how one man forgetting the rules of match cost him the victory.  Other matches include WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. Razor Ramon, the long awaited match between Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Marty Jannetty match with Sensational Sherri making her return for the first time since she was knocked out with the glass mirror, Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Big Boss Man, Steiner Brothers vs. Beverly Brothers, and the debut of Bobby Heenan revealing ""The Narcissist"" Lex Luger.1994 - This Rumble took place in Providence, RI at the Providence Civic Center featuring the Rumble debuts of Jim Cornette, Billy & Bart Gunn of Smokin' Gunns, Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash, Jeff Jarrett, Doink The Clown, Mabel & Mo of Men On A Mission, Bob ""Sparky Plugg"" Holly, Brian ""Adam Bomb"" Clark, and Great Kabuki.  This Rumble featured such highlights as one man's dominance & having the most eliminations in the match to the point where the crowd got behind him, five to seven men working together on more than once occasion to eliminate one, one wrestler unable to compete, rivals either working together or against each other, and what happened to the final two that's never happened before & the crowds reaction.  WWE Champion Yokozuna defended the championship against Undertaker in not only a Casket Match but what would also be Taker's only title match against Yoko in a match that was literally Taker fighting the odds as Yokozuna showed that he had a lot of friends in high places.  Bret & Owen Hart had their issues after the previous Survivor Series PPV only to bury the hatchet & challenge WWE Tag Team Champions Quebeckers in a match that saw Bret suffer an injury that would change more than just the course of the match.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. I.R.S. that saw the appearance of another man having issues in regards to the Intercontinental Championship, and Tatanka vs. Bam Bam Bigelow.1995 - Tampa, Florida's USF Sun Dome hosted the 1995 edition of the event featuring the Rumble debuts of The Roadie a.k.a. ""Road Dogg"" Jesse James & wrestling legend Dick Murdock.  The special guest hostess for this event was ""Baywatch"" star Pamela Anderson as she was set to escort the winner of the Royal Rumble match to the ring at the upcoming WrestleMania as the Rumble was actually the shortest Rumble in history as every participant came out after 1 minute instead of the traditional 2 minutes featuring such highlights as history being made in regards to not only what number the winner drew but how he took advantage of the rules to win the match, another superstar who went a very long distance in the match, and a wrestler looking for revenge for what happened earlier in the night.  WWE Champion Diesel defended the championship against Bret Hart in his first televised match back since Survivor Series that saw Bret use a more aggressive style that anyone has seen from him that saw both of them continue to go despite so many instances of the match getting out of control that gets overshadowed by their Survivor Series match later in the year.  Other matches include Jeff Jarrett vs. Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon, Bam Bam Bigelow teaming with Tatanka in the Tag Team Title tournament finals against 1-2-3 Kid & Bob Holly along with the confrontation with Lawerence Taylor afterwards, and Undertaker vs. I.R.S. in what began the year long story in regards to Undertaker's urn.1996 - The event returns to California at Fresno's Selland Arena featuring the Rumble debuts of Ahmed Johnson, Skip & Sunny of The Bodydonnas, Dustin Rhodes' ""Goldust"" character along with his wife Terri a.k.a. ""Marlena"", wrestling legend Dory Funk Jr., Hakushi, Vader, Hunter Hearst-Helmsley and Steve Austin.  The Rumble this year featured various highlights including the impressive debut performance of the future Triple H, the battle of the super heavyweights...on more than one occasion, Jerry Lawler's performance...or lack there of, Jake Roberts' return, one wrestler looking for revenge for what happened earlier in the night, best friends & partners going at it, Vader getting out of control, and a Rockers' reunion.  WWF Champion Bret Hart defended his championship against Undertaker, still wearing a mask protecting his face from the eye injury months earlier, in a match where both Taker & Bearer made it clear that they would do whatever it took to win the WWE Championship even if it was unpopular & against the rules with the biggest story being what happened before the match that would have an effect later on.  Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon walked into the Rumble for the third year in a row defending his championship against Goldust with the debuting Marlena with Goldust making Razor very uncomfortable during the match with his mannerisms with this match being very controversial due to the backstage politics of how one man refused to work with the other.  Other matches include Tag Team Champions Smokin' Gunn vs. Body Donnas & Ahmed Johnson vs. Jeff Jarrett.1997 - The Alamodome in San Antonio, TX set a Royal Rumble attendance record of over 60,000 people this year which featured the debuts of Ron ""Faarooq"" Simmons, D'Lo Brown, mexican legend Mil Mascaras, Marc Mero, Terry Funk, Flash Funk a.k.a. 2 Cold Scorpio, Mick ""Mankind"" Foley, and Dwayne Johnson/The Rock under his ""Rocky Miavia"" character.  The main event was the hometown hero Shawn Michaels challenging WWE Champion Sysco Sid in a Survivor Series rematch with this also being the last time that his manager Jose Lothario would be in his corner with Shawn having a new (or his old) attitude but also fighting the fact that he was wrestling with a high temperature due to the flu in a match that showed signs of ""deju"" from their previous encounter.  The Royal Rumble battle royal itself featured such highlights as many of the matches earlier in the card picking up right where they left off, the dominance of Steve Austin & his constant encounters with Bret Hart, the issues between Tag Team Champions British Bulldog & Owen Hart, one person almost setting a record, the hardcore Foley/Funk feud continuing once again, and the controversial ending.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Hunter Hearst-Helmsley vs. Goldust, Ahmed Johnson vs. Faarooq, Vader vs. Undertaker with an unexpected appearance, and a special attraction of a six man tag match featuring stars of the A.A.A. promotion in Mexico.",WWE Royal Rumble: The Complete Anthology - Volume Two

We really never know how Reilly actually fit in these stories.The stories are great, wish they'd made more of them.The sets are really cool and original. Must have been lots of location shooting for these series. I look for many details in sets and it's really there for this period piece.Two cons;- The damn music and sound recording is bad. Par for anything the Brits do in movies, they never seems to understand what role music has to do in movies. Keep your finger on the volume knob. Either you don't hear what they saying or your ears will be blasted by music and you really can't hear what they saying.Then, those damn flutes!I said it other Brits movies that the flutes and playing it ear-pearcing loud is a must for them.

234377,"A downbeat love story pickled in bile and booze, this melodrama of addiction by the great Blake Edwards skirts the same terrain as ""Lost Weekend"" without ever getting preachy. Instead, Edwards examines the sullied yet undying connection between his two self-destructive protagonists, played by Lemmon and Remick with unblinking honesty. (Two specific scenes--his in a madhouse and hers in a motel--are wrenching.) Charles Bickford lends terrific support as Kirsten's widower father, as does Jack Klugman in a small role as Joe's AA sponsor.

119296,"What I really liked was the acting by the veteran actors (meaning experienced in the acting, not necessarily in the military sense).  My favorite was James Whitmore as the tobacco chewing, gritty sergeant who kept going although his feet were frozen.  Van Johnson, Ricardo Montalban, Jim Arness, Richard Jaekel and others were fantastic in their memorable roles.  I will always remember Van Johnson's character with  the raw eggs dripping off his steel pot.  That scene where the GI is blowing smoke rings in the face of the German soldier while negotiations were going on with General McAuliffe (who answered the Germans with ""Nuts!) showed the termity and stubborness of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne. I remembered those scenes when I saw it back in the 1950's as a kid.  They always will be with me.  They showed how human the GI was.Technically, it is not at the same level as Saving Private Ryan, but at that time the expertise.  This was before Stephen Ambrose got veterans involved in telling their stories and in the making of movies.  Sure I would have liked to see more of the German soldiers and tanks, but the movie reflected the times.",N/A

178040,"Dashiel Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective.In The Glass Key Hammett takes a little different run at that same idea. The protagonist this time is not the usual detective but an old fashioned political `fixer'. No, not the `spin doctor' or `flak' of modern media-driven politics but the older handler of the retail politics that counted in local urban scene with the added factor of a little off hand, old fashioned mob influence. Nevertheless, the `fixer' Ned Beaumont has all the resourcefulness, toughness, loyalty, and hard-boiled common sense that we have come to expect of Hammett's real detectives.The plot revolves around the familiar problem of electoral politics-getting elected. In this case getting a Senator with a beautiful daughter, Janet, and an errant son, Taylor, reelected. Add in some political factions, also mob-dominated, a fair share of corrupt officials, an off hand murder and other crimes and misdemeanors and you would hardly know we are not dealing with a `normal' Hammett novel. Further add in a slowly evolving romance between Ned and the afore-mentioned Senator's daughter who is also the object of his boss's affections and you have quite a mix. Frankly, I prefer Hammett's detectives but any time you can get your hands on one of his books do so.In the film version of the novel that follows the script of the book pretty closely the part of Ned is played by a young Alan Ladd. The Senator's daughter, Janet, is played by Veronica Lake. Naturally in the film the romantic tension is given more play than in the book. Some of the scenes between them, especially that classic Lake look when she is being coy, are worth the price of admission. Brian Donlevy as Ned's boss also has his moments.",N/A

We're a borish clan of belicos chicken arena leather-heads who don't appreiciate such talent in writing or plot. I can't even imagine why this would be ""upsetting"" anyway except for the Patty Duke schnanigans with her Mordia character's finger bites(a poison thumb tack that's all).  Didn't know this show even exhisted at all but got season one last year and it was unlike any ""cartoon"" (animation) I've ever seen as a child or adult!  This aired when I was maybe 21 but I would have enjoyed it then as much as children yet no one did in my neck of the wood.  I did breifly see a DVD commentary of ""well, maybe a season two in the next release"" by the tactfully sounding filmmaker in response to Noel North's over eager enthusiasm of her being a Knight in part two.  That is why I am led here to see if that release became reality. Thier are only a handfull of major actors here but they are all profoundly talented and some extras are thrown in from time to time as Patty Duke's wonderfully witchy voice as Mordrea and other well known VO only talents that I've heard since childhood(Skeletor as Merlin?)

1028213,"Otto Preminger's ""Angel Face"" has always had a special place in my heart.  Preminger, as a filmmaker, is certainly noteworthy--but aside from a few films (including ""Laura"" and ""Anatomy of a Murder""), he isn't one of my particular favorites.  I don't know--to me, he was more of a technician than an artist.  He made good films, in general, but doesn't have the appeal of some of the other ""big name"" directors.  I love ""Angel Face,"" however, pretty much for one reason--Jean Simmons.  Simmons, I believe, is one of our most underrated actresses.  She has played the lead in some very high profile and versatile films, including the scathing ""Elmer Gantry,"" the epic ""Spartacus,"" the terrific musical ""Guys and Dolls,"" and Olivier's ""Hamlet.""  Relegated to mostly TV roles for the last few decades, I wish her film legacy was more widely appreciated.  ""Angel Face"" is particularly noteworthy in her film oeuvre because it gives her the rare opportunity to play a femme fatale type.Robert Mitchum, playing an ambulance driver, responds to call involving a wealthy matriarch.  It seems as if Mrs. Tremayne has been mysteriously poisoned by gas.  Upon his visit, he meets Mrs. Tremayne's freeloading husband and her stepdaughter--played with haughty playfulness by Simmons.  Infatuated with the young beauty, he soon falls under her spell and actually starts to work for the estate as the chauffeur.  Relinquishing a former relationship and financial independence, he becomes more and more involved in the family dynamic playing out in the mansion.  It soon becomes apparent that not all is as it seems and a psychological thriller, of sorts, starts to develop.Essentially, while ""Angel Face"" is structured as a conventional noir--it can also be judged as an effective character study.  From the haunting music, the shadowy stretches of mansion, the wistful stares from rain-streaked windows--the mood and atmosphere establish a familiar ambiance.  But pitting the tough guy persona of Mitchum against the emotional aloofness of Simmons, we see two distinct and intriguing personalities.  Simmons, with her doll-like features and regal manner, is really what distinguishes this picture.  With a more typical noir leading lady, ""Angel Face"" would not be nearly as effective.  Simmons' playing against type adds to the suspense and mystery--it's almost as if we are lured (along with Mitchum) deeper into the story due to our expectations connected to Simmons as an actress.I highly recommend ""Angel Face.""  While not Preminger's best film, it certainly ranks in the top.  And while not necessarily the best or most original noir, it certainly is effective and creepy.  This is the case of a lot of talented individuals making a very solid and entertaining film.  KGHarris, 01/07.",Angel Face

1032338,"The movie is interesting in that you know from the very beginning that  the lovers will be re-united in the end; they give you plenty of clues along the way. The movie tells how Ed Norton tricked the inspector played by Giamatti to do the right thing in the end. The interesting part of the movie is to figure out how the Illusionist will win his true love. All the acting is good. Giamatti steals the show. Norton is his usual competent self. The cinematograpy is great. Glass's score is terrific. The biggest disappointment to me is that the tricks were all special effects. You don't know whether the illusionist is a trickster or a supernaturalist. The movie really never explains. I'm sure that confusion is intended. Some of the tricks defy explanation in the conventional sense in 19th century Vienna. The only thing ""The Prestige"" has over this movie is that some of the tricks were explained. In the Illusionist nothing is explained except for how they fooled the inspector.However, this fault is a small point. On the whole, I strongly recommend the movie. The locket is nice symbol throughout the movie of the love of the couple and life in general. The movie is very entertaining.",N/A
260361,"product reviewed: Beneath the POTA, various releases of same widescreen DVD version from 2000-2006I place this film among my favorite SF movies. Regardless of its status as a sequel, I find Beneath to be a great science fiction in its own right. It is both a post-apocalyptic tale as well as apocalyptic, due to the cyclical history presented in the Apes universe. Astronaut Brent crash lands on an unknown planet far in the future. Apes rule the planet, but are challenged by a surviving race of mutant humans with superior mental powers of thought control. These human remnants also possess a doomsday bomb!It is interesting that in the final battle, both apes and mutants feel a similar sense of holy crusade against the infidel. Brent is caught in the middle, neither ape nor mutant. He has few allies and no place in this world. Both the film and the novelization focus on the psychological distress that Brent suffers, and James Franciscus plays the part with conviction.I love this film, regardless of its association with the great Planet of the Apes saga. It stands apart from the first film as a unique story with a mystery that unravels before Brent. The wayward astronaut discovers not only where he is, but what happened to humanity after the near-destruction of the world centuries earlier.This DVD edition of the early 2000s is widescreen, and the cleanest picture yet. There are no bonus features to speak of. All the key players are dead at this point, but a running textual commentary option by a knowledgable author or film historian would have been much appreciated.Extras: trailer.

185380,"If you're about my age (late 30s), then you're likely to have fond memories of Schoolhouse Rock, the adorable short educational cartoon songs which were shown between commercials on Saturday mornings during the 1970s.  Now, for the first time, you can have every Schoolhouse Rock tune ever made on this great 2-disc set.  Of course, all of your familiar favorites are here, from ""Conjunction Junction"" to ""I'm Just a Bill,"" but there are many forgotten treasures as well, such as a Nike ad using ""Three is a Magic Number.""  The show's original creators have also written a totally new song, ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College"" (about the electoral college), which perfectly recaptures the magical feel of this amazing series.Schoolhouse Rock may be 30 years old, but this set takes full advantage of modern DVD technology, offering a wide variety of viewing options (such as jukebox and shuffle features) as well as some fun extras on Disc 2.  And don't be fooled into thinking that Schoolhouse Rock is too outdated for today's kids:  my 7-year old nephew, who excels at Math, recently loved watching all of the number songs with us, and my younger neices are captivated by the catchy tunes and silly graphics in songs like ""Elbow Room.""

775169,"Even though this DVD was directly transferred from an imperfect tape (only occasional brief glitches or tracking lines that don't really detract from the show anyway), and it's in MONO (Dvd box says Dolby Digital), I still loved this show. By the way, the show is only about 37 minutes long (not the 48 minutes, that the Amazon product details, lists it as).It had a demo tape/Dvd vibe to it- as if this tape/Dvd was made for the network exec's.- to decide if they should get their own show. It worked. They got it. I felt privileged to get a chance to watch it. The fact that it was unpolished, made me like it even more.They reminiscence about how they met, and show pictures, all while the ""I Got You Babe"" music plays. Then they sing ""I Got you Babe"", an entire 3 minutes sung while they were both still sitting on the couch.  Very nicely done and almost hypnotic.

143479,"I think Sid & Nancy might just be the best rock-based biographical film yet done. Better than Oliver Stone's The Doors, better than last year's dismal Brian Jones flick whose name isn't worthy of being repeated here. The reason Sid & Nancy rises above the rest can be summed up in one word: talent. Sid & Nancy is the result of a passionate filmmaker getting near-perfect performances from his well-chosen cast, of welding great music and attention-grabbing scenery to a modern tragedy that touches many emotions. The result is a five-star film.People are surprised when I tell them the Sex Pistols rank among my all-time favorite groups. No, I was never a punk, and besides, when I was growing up `70's punk bands were mostly curiosities from modern pop culture history, but I do like the music the Sex Pistols produced on their one and only legitimate album, and the film Sid & Nancy, much criticized by pompous purists and much praised by most everyone else, is a chronicle of that era and two of its most infamously doomed participants. The chameleonic Gary Oldman brings Sid Vicious not only to life, he somehow surpasses the original to vicariously embody a character more memorable than the flesh and blood young man on whom the role is based. Likewise Chloe Webb (who really deserved better career choices than she got after this movie) brings the manic-depressive Nancy Spungen back from the grave in all her alienating, irritatingly pathetic hideousness.Some say this movie takes liberties with the timeline of Sid and Nancy's short lives, and others say it manages to glamorize them for the wrong things. Probably legitimate gripes, I'll grant, but there are also those who refuse to see the greatness in, say, Shakespeare's Richard III, because the fictionalized villain bears scant resemblance to the real man. That's much the same case here. For all one might say in criticism of this movie, Alex Cox did the impossible and revived the decaying, culture-shocked world of 1970's London, and against that stage he crafted a story that works well. Sid & Nancy is about drugs, music, twisted love between two misfit human beings, needless death, and a revolutionary movement that imploded on its nihilism even as its message was lost on the masses. Sid & Nancy is not only about Sid and Nancy, so emblematic of their time and place, it is the tragic chronicle of the spirit of misguided post-adolescent reaction against a dismal age.",N/A

I don't watch too many new movies, but I was ""forced"" to watch ""Night at the Museum"" as someone had purchased it for me as a gift. It was a pleasure to watch it, and I would happily recommend it to others.The sets are really beautiful in this film. From elaborate Roman soldiers to beautiful African safari scenes, this movie spared no expense on the stage. It makes for highly entertaining viewing even before you take any other aspects into account.The humor is quite funny as well. Mickey Rooney definitely shows his age, but he spits insults with fury, and definitely brings a smile to your face. Van Dyke is less funny, but he is also good in his role (I think the funniest Van Dyke scene might actually be in the end credits.) As far as the remainder of the cast, I wouldn't say the actors (Stillar, Owen Wilson, and Robin Williams) are as funny as the scenes and lines they are given. There are some truly ""laugh out loud"" funny moments. (The ""Gulliver's Travels"" set stands out in my mind.) While the movie loses a little bit of the humor steam an hour through, this brings laughs to the end.The one possible ""turn off"" is the fact that the film is incredibly cheesy. This isn't a problem for someone who just wants to watch some entertainment and is willing to overlook the cheesiness, but if you try and take the movie seriously at all, you will be turned off by Stillar's ""chat with the Huns,"" for instance. Take the film with a grain of salt as you are supposed to, though, and this hits the right buttons.And who is this film intended for? Well, the kids should love it from beginning to end.

Trying to make one as an independent feature minus all the Hollywood gloss and big production numbers is even tougher but then this film isn't your typical combination of music, drama and romance.""Once"" manages to be both bold and marvelous at the same time. This delightful film tells the story of an Irish musician (Glen Hansard) who falls for a classically trained piano player and Czech immigrant (Marketa Irglova) who is living with her daughter and mother. The two discover a surprising musical compatibility as well in addition to their unexpected romance. A small independent release that disappeared from theaters as quickly as it opened, ""Once"" is one of those films that you can delightfully discover as it moves on to its second life on home video without feeling guilty about the quality.Hansard who plays in the rock band Frames brings his character to life as much through song as he does through performance. Written and directed by Hansard's band mate John Carney, the film takes a bit to take off but once it does it soars. This isn't your fantasy musical however and Carney doesn't shy away from showing the hardship that two street musicians face in a world that largely gives them an unsympathetic ear.The film looks quite good on DVD considering its low budget nature and feeling that it was shot on the fly. Audio sounds quite good as well with a crisp, clear quality that one might not expect on an independent film such as this.We get an observant and intelligent commentary track by director Carney and his stars. They discuss everything from their characters in the film to making music. There is also a track specific commentary track with the trio as well. ""Making a Modern Day Musical"" is a very good featurette that focuses on the challenges that Carney faced with the musical genre as well as the difficulties he and the cast faced in trying to pull it off convincingly. ""More Guy, More Girl"" focuses on the unnamed main characters and their relationship.

778626,"I just wanted to comment briefly on the video quality of this set. I just bought a new HDTV and was looking forward to watching this series filling that nice large screen in a proper 16:9 aspect ratio. As everyone probably knows, all the DVDs in this series suffer from some quality issues due to the way the CGI shots were originally done. This was noticeable in previous season releases as well as this one. So I was prepared for this when I popped the first disc in. But I wasn't prepared for the extreme amounts of grain in the video. When watching this on my old 32"" Trinitron TV, the video looked fine. But on my new 46"" HDTV, it looks really, really awful. All the flaws are laid bare on a large HDTV screen. At first, I thought it was an issue with my TV. But all my other DVDs look fantastic. So I tweaked the settings as much as I could, but it didn't really help much. Then for comparison purposes, I popped in a disc from Season 1. There is some noticeable grain there, too, but it's still quite watchable and it even gives it a nice film-like quality which is kind of pleasing. I also tried the movie ""A Call to Arms"" from the Babylon 5 movie collection set. It looks pretty good, too. But on the Season 4 set, and on ""Thirdspace"" from the movie set, the grain is seriously distracting and looks just plain bad. It has unfortunately ruined my enjoyment of this very good season. From what I've read, this seems to be a problem with the source and not with the DVD transfers themselves, so I don't know if this will ever be correctable.

The movie was puzzling, scarey and totally capturing of interest. I recommend this miniseries to anyone that likes science fiction mixed with mystery.",The Lost Room
417726,"The reviewers who complained about the quality of the DVD are correct. The sound was muddy; nothing was crisp.Now, to the substance -- the movie, incorporating a figure who appeared in an interpolated story in an early Sayles novel (Union Dues) into the historical shoot-out between Sid Hatfield and the Baldwin-Felts thugs, is excellent. The pacificism of Sayles' union organizer stands in contrast to the quick-tempered violence of the miners, but both stand against the pure brutishness of the Baldwin-Felts agents. Matewan's mayor and Sid Hatfield stand as heroes, as do more than a few who pick up guns in the final confrontation. Yet the young man whose maturation we witness in the story leaves as a disciple of Sayles' organizer. He chooses words, not guns.Good performances, including an excellent performance by James Earle Jones.",Matewan VHS

The singing is fabulous and Renee is obviously vocally giving everything she has to the performances. She also seems to really be enjoying the ability to hear her voice soar in the cathedral. ""Laudaumus Te"", and ""Ave Maria"" are the standouts.Renee also looks fabulous with her classical beauty and designer gown.",Renee Fleming: Sacred Songs
949400,"I had actually owned this movie for awhile, but had not gotten around to watching it until we went to see STARDUST...based on another Neil Gaiman story.  We enjoyed that very much, so I dug out the DVD and my wife and 14 year old daughter and I plunked down for an enjoyable evening.104 minutes later, my wife was asleep and my daughter barely awake.  I was still watching, but felt guilty for having wasted so much time.The movie is STUNNING to look at...no question about that.  It basically captures a feeling of a dream better than almost any movie in recent memory.  A young teenage girl, feeling worried and guilty about her mother's serious illness, falls into a dream inspired by her owned crazy drawings and driven by a growing need to rescue a ""white"" queen and vanquish (sorta) a ""dark"" queen.  Both queens are played by the actress who plays the mother, so we immediately assume that story is how the girl will work out the conflict between herself, her mother and even her mother's illness.The movie is fantastic to look at.  It is highly creepy, and made us all question the PG rating...we thought PG-13 would have been more appropriate.  The dreamland is populated by an assortment of disturbing creatures.  Each new scene brought a new visual splendor.  The film does not lack imagination.  It's like watching visual art come to life.  For awhile, we were enthralled.But then it become quite obvious that the film had nothing of real interest to tell us through these visuals.  The idea of a young girl working out serious problems in her life through dreams or dream-like incidents was just played out a  million times better in PAN'S LABRYNTH (although, to be fair, MIRRORMASK is even more visually creative).  The plot was quite skimpy and the journey of the young lady became repetitive and more and more uninvolving.  It was simply hard to want to watch through to the end.  I glanced at my watch every two or three minutes...thinking surely 15 minutes have gone by.Over the history of filmmaking, many visually stunning films have been made that stretched the boundaries of technical and visual possibilities.  2001: A SPACE ODDESSEY.  NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  And like those films, MIRROR MASK failed to enchant on a basic story-telling basis.Before I forget, let me first praise Stephanie Leonidas, who plays the teenage hero of the film.  She is terrific and I would have liked to see more of her performance and perhaps less upstaging by the visuals.The movie is an interesting failure.  In most cases, a film that bored me so thoroughly would get no more than 2 stars, possibly just 1...but MIRROR MASK has too much creativity to simply get slapped down.  But beware...it is tough to get through.",N/A
958915,"Why this movie is an award winner I don't know, and can't imagine.  Its production quality is first rate, but the values in it are horrible from a traditional values point of view.  The Thief Lord is a son of a wealthy family that steals.  In a way, he is a fifteen year old Robin Hood.  It isn't made clear what he does with the money, except that he seems to support a bunch or orphans and runaway kids.  There is a bit of fantasy in the story as a magical merry-go-around turns kids into adults and adults into kids.  If parents show this movie to their kids, there is much to discuss.  I sometimes say that nobody is completely useless; they can always be used as a bad example.  I'd say the same about this movie - it isn't completely useless, parents can point out all these kids are doing wrong or immorally.  However, there are so many great movies with good traditional values that it seems pointless to waste time on one such as this.  There are even a few swear words in the movie.","Thief Lord, The"
899466,"I picked this up on a whim from the clearance bin at a local video store, and I was very pleasantly surprised!  This little film was plainly a labor of love for its creators -- unknown actors, low-budget, and a story line that's waaaay off the beaten path.  It's also witty, touching and very funny!There have been a number of harsh reviews here saying that this is either (take your pick) a commercial for the Mormon church or an exercise in Mormon/Baptist bashing.  Bunk.  It's a low-key, personality-based comedy and a perceptive look at small-town America.  I assure you no Mormons or Baptists were harmed during the making, or viewing, of this film.If you'd enjoy a little, well-written, down-home comedy/romance that's safe for the entire family, then I recommend Baptists At Our Barbecue!",Baptist At Our Barbecue

1045254,"I really love this movie. It is very moving but yet sad as well, because of the untimely tragic happening that had happened to Bobby Kennedy, a man who was really hoping to make things better for the nation. The year was 1968. It was a year that the nation had encountered some negative occurrences. The war in Vietnam was worse than ever, people were getting high on drugs, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in April of that year, and, there was still racism and prejudice. The movie stars William H. Macy, who plays a manager of the famous, but now demolished Ambassador Hotel, Sharon Stone plays his beautician wife (who looks almost like Barbara Eden of I Dream of Jeannie and Nancy Sinatra), Helen Hunt, Martin Sheen, and a few other well known actors of today. What is really wonderful is the archival footage of Bobby giving speeches, and his famous speech in the Embassy Room of the hotel being meshed into the movie. It is so excellent that when you see the footage of his victory speech, you almost get the feeling that the crowd in the movie is watching him give it. From what I learned among one of the special features of this DVD is that some scenes were shot in the actual hotel one week before it was demolished. Thirty-six hours after the film was completed, the famous Ambassador Hotel was gone. When watching this movie, you almost get the feeling that you are actually in Los Angeles inside that hotel and in 1968. This movie is highly recommended for any person who is into famous events in U.S. history. Now, as for the special features, there is Bobby: The Making of an American Epic, Eyewitness Accounts from the Ambassador Hotel, and the Theatrical Trailer. The Eyewitness Accounts is wonderful to see, because it has people who were working with Bobby on his campaign and were also at the hotel on that now famous night in June, 1968. Descriptions of the campaign and the events from that night are also revealed in that feature as well. From what I learned, if Bobby had won the election in 1968 (and been inaugurated as President in January, 1969), things would have been different and possibly much better for the nation. The racial tensions and rioting would have ended, the war in Vietnam would have ended in 1969 instead of continuing on until 1972, the Watergate scandal would not have happened, and perhaps several other positive things would have been made possible by Bobby. When Bobby was shot, all of the nation's hopes and dreams were suddenly taken away from us. It was all over. Things became more chaotic and hectic for the next several years. Get this movie; you will love it!!",N/A

236266,"""The Bad Seed"" holds a unique place in cinema history for daring (in 1956) to show a small child as being a wilful and calculating evil killer.  I can only imagine the impact it must have had on it's release in the 1950's when portraying such cold-blooded behaviour in children would be unprecedented. But as a viewer today, I can only review it based on my own impressions, and whether it lives up to it's reputation and still works today.The story is not complicated, it revolves simply around an eight year old girl named Rhoda and her family. Rhoda appears to be the perfect daughter, all plaits and smiles and frilly dresses, but unbeknown to her mother she is a skilled troublemaker, and has no compunction or guilt in ""removing"" obstacles that stand in the way of her getting what she wants. Most notably, the action centres on a school handwriting competition that sees Rhoda denied first place. The prize goes to another classmate who is subsequently found drowned...is it possible that rivalry among a class of kids this young could lead to murder? And how could it possibly be the ultra-cute Rhoda with her cute manners and sunny demeanor? It's left up to Rhoda's mother, Christine, to face up to the terrible truth behind her daughter's perfect facade.What works the best is undoubtedly Patty McCormack's performance as Rhoda. Without her portrayal the film would not be half of what is is here. Totally relaxed and confident, McCormack brings the character beautifully to life. Her delivery, ranging from petulant, suger-sweet, angry or cruel is spot on every time, and her facial expressions rival many adult actors in terms of ambiguity. It's easy to believe Rhoda has most adults in the palm of her hand with her disarming good manners and sweet behaviour, but it's equally easy to imagine the evil underneath when she is seen purposely covering up damning evidence or taunting the few brave souls that dare speak out against her. As long as Rhoda is on screen, the film is a joy to watch. But conversely, when she's not....oh dear. The film creaks to a slow crawl as the adult characters mill about with lots of hand-wringing and soul searching as they try and make sense of the bizarre goings on. The worst offender is Nancy Kelly in the pivotal role of Christine, Rhoda's anxious mother. Both Kelly and McCormack played the same characters in the original stage production, but unfortunately, unlike the serene McCormack, Kelly acts like she's still on stage, gesticulating with tremendously exaggerated movements and hammy histrionics at every one of Rhoda's misdemeanours which look far too over-the-top on celluloid. This weeping and wailing hampers the dramatic tension greatly, and a little firmer direction of her performance could have darkened the overall tone to even better effect.Veracity is not further helped by some sadly very dated psycho-babble about the possible cause behind Rhoda's homicidal tendancies. Nancy Kelly's confession, when she reveals why she suspects Rhoda to be a ""bad seed"" is amusingly implausible, and presumably based on some kind of mid-1950's quack psychology, because it really sounds daft today. However, I will say though, that Nancy's final scene as Christine still has some potency, as she takes final measures to stop all the madness in the only way she can see how. Thanks to the tiresome Hays Code of the day, though, the film is famous for having a tacked on ending that follows Rhoda to her come-uppance (one which the stage version never meted out), and although many audiences have howled at the obvious ""divine retribution"" tone of it, if you watch it, it's actually not that bad as a plot continuation, although the actual depiction of it is rather ridiculous. What really fails, though, is the wildly inappropriate final curtain call which shows Christine enthusiastically spanking Rhoda as both giggle profusely. This 30 second shot, with no reason or relevance to ANYTHING that has gone before in the film, is the worst mistake of the whole affair, and should have been erased from as many releases as possible - it would have been a perfect DVD extra, no way should it still appear as the final shot of the movie.Having said that, the whole film itself is a lot of fun. I woudl recommend it for an afternoon's entertainment, as long as you watch it with hindsight about restrictions that go with it's time, you can appreciate the plot pretty well. It does suffer from some stagy acting, and some stagy setpieces as well, with over-reliance on a few conversation-heavy sequences that take place in just one room. But Rhoda, the blond-plaited, frilly skirted, murderous poppet who has since become almost iconic in cinema visual language, saves the day. Well done to Patty MacCormack and director Mervyn LeRoy for creating this legacy.",Bad Seed VHS

1056886,"I passed on seeing this film when it came out in the theaters, in spite of all the hype and Forrest Whitaker's Oscar win.  I thought it was going to be a biopick of Idi Amin and that didn't interest me.  However, I got it free at the library and, the night before the DVD was due, I put it in the machine to see if I might be interested.The fact that the protagonist was really the young Scottish dr. made it more interesting to me than I had expected.  When I watched it, I assumed that it he was a real character.  Then, by reading the reviews here I discovered he wasn't, which puts the whole film in a different place in my head.  How much was real and how much wasn't??  It could worry me a little but I chose to let it go and just enjoy it.Actually the use of the dr. is a smart device that works well and it certainly makes for an interesting story.  James McAvoy is a bit annoying, but that is good, too, given the nature of the fellow he's portraying.  At first I thought he was going to be a real hero and I kept wondering when he was going to wise up and get out of there. A lot about him was ""wrong"" --he looked way too young and was just too scrawny and silly looking to have so many women falling for him.  And what was he, really, a good decent guy who wanted to help out, or a spoiled punk who was just out for an adventure???  I thought the character was really very well written and acted by showing the complexity of the guy.  I ended up by seeing him as totally believable.Forrest Whittaker was superb and surely deserved the Oscar. He portrayed the full range of this distressing man's personality with brilliance as everyone here has remarked.  I especially liked the childlike, innocent facet.But, after all the smoke cleared, it was the character of the dr. that most interested me.  Too bad, he was fictional!",N/A
