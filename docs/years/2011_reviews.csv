1134943,"The love story between the two gals is simply not believable because there is nothing prior to their ""awakening"" that indicates either one of them was physically or emotionally attracted to the other. Was Nina a lesbian when she first appears on the screen? Was Lisa a lesbian coincidentally working in the restaurant? No clues given. The director (Parma) was ultimately timid about the subject and the first kiss between Nina and Lisa is delivered without spark and passion -- and if there's more to being a lesbian than just two women kissing, you won't find it with these characters. The story of two women destined to find an interest in each other beyond their attachment to the restaurant lacks evolution. Finally, the pseudo-Bollywood ending was not only out of place, but it made whatever came before it absurd.",N/A
53285,"The first hour of ""Casino"" (1995) represents Martin Scorsese at his best - a mini-masterpiece of cinematic bravado depicting the inner workings of a Las Vegas pleasure palace. Unfortunately, once you get past the dazzling semi-documentary introduction, the remaining two hours become a tired self-parody of the director's earlier crime films. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone cannot redeem a disappointingly melodramatic script by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. In the end, the ambitious yet overlong ""Casino"" fails to pay off.",N/A
1324181,"The Social Network is another masterpiece by David Fincher. The film is gripping, entertaining, and important. The Facebook movie easily could've become a joke but Fincher is able to make things that are boring and foreign really exciting. I saw The Social Network first in theaters and thought it was solid but after watching it on blu-ray multiple times the film has really stuck with me. There are lines in the movie that I still think about weeks after seeing the film. Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin and Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg are both tremendous. Garfield is the heart and soul of the film in my opinion and Eisenberg is so believable as the aloof and slightly arrogant lead character.The blu-ray version of the film looks and sounds wonderful. The film is really dark in the sense that there is very little light in the film and most of the scenes are in the dark and indoors. This is where the blu-ray quality really stands out - every scene is clear and there are no dark spots. I can't speak to the quality of either of the commentary tracks or special features but there does seem to be a reasonable amount of features.",N/A

She is certainly very strong, but I greatly enjoyed all the performances.The orchestra and sets are very enjoyable as the singers simply carry you away.  I didn't care too much for the candy stripes on the stage floor, but found that to be no more than a mild irritant that can be quickly forgotten.If you are a fan of this opera, I think it's well worth adding to your collection.","Mozart - Le nozze di Figaro The Marriage of Figaro Haitink, Finley, Hagley, Fleming, Glyndebourne Festival Opera VHS"

51833,"First, I just want to make clear that I think Blues Brothers is a classic, as evidenced by the five stars. However, except for the few extra bits of great music you get, the so-called extended cut of Blues Brothers is not that good, IMO. It kills the flow of the movie by explaining too much, I think. Who cares how the Bluesmobile gets its powers, or what Elwood's job is like? The genius of John Landis' comedies was that not everything would be laid out for the audience. They're random, messy, chaotic, and sometimes you didn't get a detailed explanation. To me, that's what made them so great! For proof, just compare the first Blues Brothers film with Blues Brothers 2000, which is full of backstory and character motivations and blah-blah-blah. The theatrical cut is a classic, and whenever I've heard someone extol the virtues of the extended cut (which has been the version available longest on DVD), I just shake my head and rewatch the original.As to the quality of the Blu Ray itself, I think Universal has done a pretty nice job for a comedy that's over 30 years old. I've owned the original DVD release and the 25th Anniversary Edition, and this Blu-Ray beats both of them (as should be expected). I don't know whether the sound has been remastered, but it seems to have a little more oomph to it. My favorite musical sequence in the movie--the church sequence with James Brown--got so loud that my neighbor knocked on the door!Upgrading to Blu-Ray isn't always a necessity in the case of older catalog releases, but I'd have to recommend picking up ""The Blues Brothers"" Blu-Ray. Just make sure you watch the theatrical version first, and then go from there!",N/A

Created by the same company that created Reboot, this classic Computer Generated series is the follow up to the original Generation One Transformers. Beast Wars in America, Beasties in Canada (Canada has a rule that no show aimed at children can have war in the title). An enjoyable series that had previously been released in bare bones sets by Rhino (which I own and are now discontinued), it will now be rereleased by Shout! and they are currently working on creating some extras. While I will update this post when I know more I just wanted to express my excitement that Beast Wars will finally be getting the release it deserves!First Season Episodes:Beast Wars (1)Beast Wars (2)The WebEqual MeasuresChain of CommandPower SurgeFallen ComradesDouble JeopardyA Better MousetrapGorilla WarfareThe ProbeVictoryDark DesignsDouble DinobotThe SparkThe Trigger (1)The Trigger (2)Spider's GameCall of the WildDark VoyagePossessionThe Low RoadLaw of the JungleBefore the StormOther Voices (1)Other Voices (2)And that's all 26 episodes, the storytelling may start out slow but improves greatly as the season moves along and there are plenty of later references to the original G1 series (perhaps most noteworthy is an episode where Starscream returns and possesses the body of Waspinator). The Characters are for the most part great with a wide array of personalities and just as many interesting bots on the heroes side as on the villains. Megatron is a wonderfully twisted villain, Optimus Primal is the quintessential boyscout (other than a few key moments) and a nice element of constant tension is added by having Dinobot defect from the Predacons early and joining the Maximals. The marketing device of having status pods crash every few episodes to introduce new marketable characters is actually fairly clever and makes for many fun episodes where the teams race to collect a new member for their side. It all culminates in a season finale cliffhanger that I couldn't believe as a kid and that leads to the excellent second season where the G1 series is really revealed as relevant to the series in a much deeper and more immediate way. Hopefully Shout! will make this a release that will Maximize our viewing pleasure. Beast Wars!Note*: A Beast Wars Complete Series Set has been announced by Shout! It will be similar to the recent Reboot set -Reboot-Definitive Mainframe Edition. Announced special features for the Beast Wars complete set will reportedly be a 24 page book - Dawn of Futures Past (a comic that serves as a prequel for the series), another 12 page booklet, retrospective featurettes, interviews and art galleries.

And even that reassurance doesn't do quite enough to ease the overwhelming feelings of disgust and revulsion elicited by the torture scenes.

276861,"I've always been a fan of this little gem of a movie, but hadn't seen it in years... it still holds up and with Wiki around i did some sleuthing. I looked at the back of my dvd 1976, then looked up The Shining and both book version dates for either film/book, well it turns out this movie does predate The Shining and that explains the similar story plots, which are basically identical. While I still value each film it was surprising to find that King was a bit of a hack! lol. Anyway I won't spoil any of the storyline any more, but if you like The Shining you'll appreciate this film to a certain degree.

1380818,"Darren Aronofsky certainly knows how to make dark psychological dramas: ""The Wrestler"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" were both gritty, disturbing films that seemed almost like documentaries. Aronofsky typically gets stellar performances from his Actors and ""Black Swan"" is no exception. Natalie Portman's performance as the fragile ballerina who descends into madness is wonderfully dark. Winona Ryder's brief role as an aging, broken ballerina is outstanding as well. But the film founders about half way through and suddenly becomes twisted, dizzying, and hard to follow. The backstories of a carping ""Mommie Dearest"" and an ""All About Eve"" understudy are cliched and add detract from the film's success. But stay with it if you can and the ending is spectacularly twisted.",Black Swan

1191291,"I think the idea here was to turn Cormac McCarthy's novel into a film which was more similar to ROAD WARRIOR, however with more literary value and somberness.  Somber they got down.  This is so somber that I had trouble sitting still.  I was getting bored.  The pacing was off too.  I really like Viggo Mortensen and I am thinking of the many splendid movies he has made.  My favorite of his was HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. There sure was nothing somber or leadenly paced about that film!So this is a film about a man and his son who keep living and trudging about in a post apocalyptic world even though they don't have a moment's enjoyment in the lives they are living. The father teaches the son how to commit suicide.  They come across some suicides in a barn.  They also come across a band of marauders.Viggo Mortensen can't save this film and that is saying a lot.

1513416,"I was getting far too comfortable seeing Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, Pirate Radio, The Replacements) playing shaggy, directionless buffoons.  FINALLY he has received a strong lead giving a command performance as the Earl of Oxford.  In this compelling period piece it is he, and not the otherwise famed name, who actually penned the works of William Shakespeare.  Growing up in a noble household in which poetry and theater are analogous with sin, he finds himself the recipient of voices, rich with prosaic observations of life, which plague him until they are inked to parchment.  The products of which are the works of Shakespeare.This comes to pass as the Earl bribes a mediocre playwright (Ben Johnson, played by Sebation Armesto) to claim his plays as his own.  However, when the time comes to assume credit before his invigorated audience, Johnson hesitates.  Opportunistically, William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), a desperate actor in the play privy to Johnson's secret deal, steps forward and assumes the role.  What ensues is a web of political deception and betrayal, littered with twists which culminate in a tale more tragic than ""Shakespeare"" himself ever penned.  While I'd love to explain how, I'm NO SPOILER.Online reviews of Anonymous vary wildly in ratings from ""amazing"" to ""boring.""  While I advocate that my opinion is unique to any other and we all have our preferences, I have difficulty understanding how anyone but an ill-educated child could possibly find this ""boring"" unless we're confusing ""boring"" with plotty or ""I didn't like it.""  In defense of other aspects of this film, the set design and cinematography (occasionally CGI-enhanced) didn't quite receive the budget it deserved.  At first, this was disappointing.  However, as I watched on, I appreciated how the budget was used and enjoyed shots of poverty-stricken cityscapes and aerial views of gross architecture.  I get it--these sets are expensive.  It is also worth mentioning that I did not enjoy the characters of William Shakespeare and Ben Johnson.  These characters do little more than serve humbly as the spoon delivering the castor oil that is the ""truth"" of the plot.  I won't rule out that they could have been written considerably better, but this movie is more about the Earl of Oxford, political subterfuge, and his secret.  It's not about the over-the-top, illiterate William Shakespeare.  In fact, the least tragic element of this movie was Shakespeare's fraud.My defense of these flaws clearly identifies my stance on the movie.  I liked it a lot--really, I loved it.  Rhys Ifans has never failed to entertain me, but has never entertained me like this.  The Earl is strong yet desperate, vulnerable with respect to his work yet callous to his wife and civic responsibilities, and deeply methodical yet inconsiderate of consequence.  The Earl is the object of political and romantic turns which drive the story forward, and he is well-complemented by the Queen (played young and old by Joely Richardson of Nip/Tuck and Vanessa Redgrave, respectively) and the manipulative Cecils (played by David Thewlis and Edward Hogg).By the way, the ending...very heavy, very touching, very real.  I was truly affected.",Anonymous

792081,"Tale focuses on the British SOE (Special Operations Executive) who recruit and train British women who have backgrounds that will let them pass as French women in Nazi occupied France during WWII. For those so interested the SOE really existed and was created in 1940 by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton to conduct guerrilla warfare against the Axis and to instruct and aid local resistance movements. The main characters include an aristocratic woman and a factory worker who train together with others and are later sent to the same area of Nazi occupied France to go undercover and gradually gain crucial pieces of information. This series is much more interested in the characters and dialogue, especially how the war wears them down and affects the heads of SOE as well as loved ones back in England. The series was on a budget at times. Indoors felt like the stage of a play and there were some minor moves by the characters here and there that didn't make sense or were things operatives would never do (I can't list the main points without giving spoilers). There are some nice touches in here as to how to appear French or German compared to English (i.e. how you take your tea, etc) but one of the agents seems to resort to using British swear words out in public and even though it seems private you just would not do that. Sometimes the music helps the scene but other times, especially during those rare action scenes, it sometimes works against it. Jazzy music for action scenes during the 50s and 60s was in but not so much in the late 80s and on. While there are criticisms the series was done particularly well in other areas: the characters, their dialogue and as I said above the grinding down of agents overseas and back home, as well as their loved ones. Other than the music and the slips by one of the agents this series seems pretty tight and interesting. I'll try the next season out (there are three).

419907,"""The Satan Bug"" (1965) has to be the most nerve-wracking movie I've ever experienced. I loved it.  Like a number of the MGM/UA DVD-R that have lately come through, there are some problems reported.  Besides a few blemishes that I do not remember in the VHS version I bought some time ago, some of the early credits are unreadable on the small screen or just do not come across clear enough, but it is a satisfying purchase.  There is very little today that allows for us to enjoy George Maharis as most of his work is not available on DVD except re-runs of ""Route 66.""  In a day when credits only took a few minutes (rather than ten or more as films today run them), Maharis would have certainly been in more.  It's sad.  John Sturges, the director of many classic adventures prior, directed one of his last successful hits here, later directing the film version of another Alistair MacLean novel, ""Ice Station Zebra"" (1968).  The DVD-R says it was made from ""the best source material available.""  The ""archival"" CD of the soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith had to be made from once thought lost tapes and had to include sound effects as well.  The sound here is a bit muddled.  But thankfully it is generally intact and well worth looking into and taking care of.",Satan Bug VHS

309883,"Ladies and gentlemen, the odd duck of the Bond franchise - the orphan child, or the one starring that other guy. Call it what you will. There's more than one story about why this was Lazenby's only outing as Bond. The cause may have been his ego, or on-set conflict, or his own lack of acting experience - which admittedly shows in the film. He's a bit stiffer than the other Bonds, and he's clearly trying too hard to emulate Connery. Regardless, he looks good, has the requisite athleticism to carry off the role (far more than Roger Moore, it should be noted), and isn't nearly as bad as some other critics would try to argue. Had he stuck around, he might have developed nicely.The film also has a magnificent score, very scenic vistas, solid action, and a tight pace - despite a runtime of almost 150 minutes, a feat no doubt due in part to director Peter Hunt's experience as a crack film editor. The film moves. There is also a surprisingly touching love story that is also fairly convincing - at least for a 007 film. Adding to the picture's odd duck mystique, it was the only film in the series until Casino Royale that featured an unhappy ending. Oh, yes - did I mention Diana Rigg is in it? The film gets an extra half-star for her presence alone. By Bond standards, great stuff.",N/A

1435841,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, those lovable Brits from ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", are back. Pegg and Frost star as Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings, two grown-up nerds who've come to America for Comic-Con and a tour of all the famous alien hot spots. It's the ultimate nerd ""holiday"", as they would call it. What they didn't expect, was actually coming across an alien, which of course is what happens. The alien is Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen): he's on the run from the FBI, and he really needs a ride in their RV.Ironically, part of what makes the character of Paul so unique is just how normal he seems to be, which is as refreshing as it is unlikely. The character of Paul is basically if Seth Rogen was an alien, which again, is totally fine with me. There's something comforting about Paul being essentially human in nature, yet not at all; he's cool, easygoing, down to earth (pun intended). He smokes (cigarettes and weed), swears, gets drunk, and references pop culture. It's hard not to like Paul.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have built-in chemistry, and Rogen sidles in to the mix quite nicely. Overall though, there begins to be too many supporting players, with Kristen Wiig tagging along as the evolution-denying religious nutcase (she has a t-shirt with Jesus shooting Charles Darwin), the three FBI agents on their tail, two rednecks (three if you count Wiig's dad), and Jane Lynch, Blythe Danner and Sigourney Weaver all making small appearances. None of these people give bad performances (Bill Hader is predictably hilarious as the bumbling FBI agent), but a lot of times I just wanted more focus on the three stars of the film.The movie does get caught up a couple times in lambasting religion, but at least it doesn't hijack the plot (I'm looking at you, ""Invention of Lying""). And the stereotypical bible-toting, shotgun-bearing redneck comes close to ruining the whole thing. Like Paul says, ""Whatever, dude"". Overall, the movie ""Paul"" is a lot like its title character. It's goofy, light-hearted, maybe a bit thin, but overall a great time and leaves you with a smile on your face.",Paul

Later Jack discovers Marybeth is a Dunstan and orders her out and to go talk to Rev. Zombie. Victor shows up at Jack's shack, rips out his intestine then uses it as a cord to pop off his head. The killing and gore in this movie can best be described as ""Troma"" style. Every death scene hits a major squirting artery. This beginning scene also has the bulk of the movie's nudity as Jack views a found video camera.Marybeth, who is perhaps the worst at acting in this film, visits Rev. Zombie (Tony Todd) who explains how Victor Crowley became a ghost/legend/killer with a remarkable story telling voice aka the James Earl Jones of horror movies. As it turns out, Zombie's boat was lost in Honey Island Swamp. He forms a posse (including one hot blond for one last nude/sex scene) to retrieve his boat and to kill Victor Crowley once and for all.People die in all kinds of ways as Crowley seems to have an endless supply of gasoline powered tools. Notice when faces are being smashed, they have a tendency to bounce back as if they are made of rubber. In the old house, where everything is grown over, there is a new door. Cletis was my favorite redneck character. He was realistic.Caution: If you are an easily offended Christian, there is one scene (in addition to all the killing, gore and nudity) that you might find offensive. You will know it when you hear it.",Hatchet II

It's a very entertaining movie, it contains nudity so anyone that may be offended by this should not watch it. But it is a different kind of movie, has humor as well as drama.

1369387,"House moves seamlessly from John Hughes-style teen comedy, to Sam Raimi-style horror come Theater of the Absurd. The film, originally released in 1977, but never in the US, is hard to define. The horror is too graphic for the film to be a comedy, yet too knowingly asinine to truly be horror. Because of it's uneven mixture of Easy Rider acid trip sequences and over-the-top humor House becomes more and more incomprehensible as it moves forward (which may be the precise recipe for a cult classic). Gorgeous and friends (all named with an odd seven dwarfs bent) retreat to her aunt's home for the summer. They make their arrival at the house with The John Hughes Cheese Factor off the charts. But it doesn't take long after their arrival for things to turn for the worse, as one disappears during dinner. Moments later her head is found inside of a well, just before it flies high in the air and swoops down, laughing, to bite her friend in the butt. Obayashi utilizes every effect and tool he can think of to make this as psychedelic as possible, further distancing this film from easy classification. If the trick was available in '77, he's trying it here. From there the film unravels into a non-sensical plot. The film is hilarious in ways that most films would never try to be. It's morbid, yes, but it's also slapstick. It is whatever kind of humor uses a jaunty tune to soundtrack a piano eating a girl and flinging her limbs in the air when it slams the lid shut. House unravels, yes, but it's satisfying. And maybe making sense, here, is unwarranted. Ultimately, the film just doesn't need to resolve, because it accomplishes its goals without tying up the loose ends.",N/A

1300899,"I've been looking forward to this movie for ages. To me - a short, uncoordinated, curvy girl - being a dancer sounds brilliant. Unfortunately, rather than take dance classes when I was young, I preferred to watch cartoons. So there must a part of me that still dreams she could be a dancer, so I get by watching these movies. Give me Showgirls, Coyote Ugly (although technically singing but never mind), Save The Last Dance, and Make It Happen and I'm a happy girl.Despite this being delayed for a little while on DVD, I finally got a copy to watch and LOVED it immediately. The movie starts off with a very YOUNG looking Christina (playing Ali) stuck in a dead end job in Nowhere-ville, dreaming of being a singer and a dancer. She ups sticks to LA and walks into a slightly camp looking bar called Burlesque and comes face to face with her dreams. And Cher. Cher manages to steal every single scene with her remarkable body for a woman in her sixties and stunning powerhouse vocals, which Christina, once she gets going, really can match.The storyline is pretty standard - I could have written it my sleep. There's nothing shocking, just very safe in terms of the storyline and characters. You've got the pretty girl who wants to make it big, the owner who's got a Heart of Stone until the right person gets close, the bad girl who will have you shouting insults at the screen, the token gay men and the token hot guy who sheds his clothes and wears eyeliner. (And has a very memorable scene with a box of cookies and not much else. That scene could keep a girl warm on a lonely night!) Oh and the bad guy who can't act, trying to steal the good girl away from the hot guy.The soundrack was amazing, and I was actually dancing in my chair a few times, and of course it will be a necessity to buy the soundtrack and play it at full volume and pretend I'm Christina Aguilera in front of a crowd of adoring people. The only thing that is missing from the soundtrack is a duet. What were they thinking??? How could they not combine Cher and Christina's talents by having them duet? Shockingly remiss of them.The last movie I saw Stanley Tucci in was The Lovely Bones - and from that movie to this, he plays completely different characters, to the point where my Dad doubted it was the same guy. He doesn't have that major a role in this film, apart from the funny gay guy who makes a brilliant comedy double act with Cher. (Did I mention she's looking AMAZING for a woman of her tender years?!)The only quibbles I have about this movie is Alan Cumming and the running time. Alan Cumming seems just a random character, thrown into the mix for no other reason than to interact with Ali when she comes into the club, and do a saucy little dance routine between dancers. It was such a throw away scene, that seemed to have been maybe added in with Alan larking around between takes. And his one ""singing"" scene is stuck in the extras. The running time is close to two hours, but could have easily been shorter and still not lost any of the storyline. And the extras could have been a bit more meaty too. Cut dance routines and a blooper reel? Give me something more exciting please!This movie is never going to win any awards - it's a feel good, enjoyable film with plenty of eye candy for the gentlemen and the ladies to both enjoy. So drag your partner by the hand to see this and get practising your dance moves. Or get the DVD and clear some space in the living room and shake what your mama gave you!",N/A

This movie explores the ways that people affect one another.  I think it does lack in the area of how personal responsibility affects a life as well.  Other people have some influence but not to the degree that this movie suggests. In some ways, this movie is advocating the idea of helplessness.  That circumstances/situations have 100% control and that a person cannot overcome those things on their own. This movie would make a good discussion with others on various life themes.",N/A
984109,After watching this series when I was young I couldn't wait to pick it up. I found it cheaper at another retailer *cough* Walmart *cough* But thats not the point. The series was over all presented great on the dvds. You could choose between Japanese or English audio and to my surprise it didn't stop there you could also choose from the original Japanese text intro and song or the English intro and song. (The difference is the intro credits in eng vs jap) The one thing that turned me off on all four of the season sets was how small they were. They shoved 2 small dvd cases into a small paper box set and put 2 dvds per case.

1392365,"Let's see here you got Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Casey Affleck, Michael Pena, and Eddie Murphy in a heist movie where do I sign up?This is a nice twist on the heist genre with a couple of bumbling idiots who wouldn't be able to steal a stick of bubble gum much less steal money getting all together to make a truly funny experience.Plot:Ben plays Josh Kovacks who is head of the tower where he works. He finds out the boss he used to have respect for Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is actually a crook who has stolen not only his money but all the employees money in the whole building. We're talking wages, life savings, what have you. Shaw is already under investigation by the Feds, so he has nothing to lose and could care less if he's brought a lot of suffering to people he swindled ala Bernie Madoff.Josh vows to get revenge assembling all of the people with an axe to grind on Shaw and planning an elaborate heist. Trouble is no one has a freaking clue how to pull it off.Josh enlists a crook named Slide (Eddie Murphy) to bring his expertise to lead the plan.This movie is very funny. Obviously all of the big names here are all comedy veterans: Stiller is a joke a minute, Broderick has always been good in whatever role he's been given, Michael Pena is a good and up coming actor,but probably the biggest surprise here has to be Eddie Murphy.Eddie is a comedy veteran to be sure, but he has been in a A LOT of bad, bad movies, so this was a nice change from all that. In fact I got a ""Trading Places"" vibe here when he gets recruited by Josh to be part of the team.There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie that everybody will have a favorite one. I personally like the ""mall scene"" early in the movie when Slide enlists the guys to rob things from the mall to show if they really have it in them to steal something.All in all this is definitely worth not just a viewing but multiple viewings at the theater.",Tower Heist

1283749,"I enjoyed this film and so would most others.The movie is meant to be a critical commentary on the modern Korean society. Much of the humor is subtle and requires an intimate understanding of the Korean society to fully understand it.The main male character is a very average Korean male. He is always harped-on because he doesn't excel in anything. He went to an average university, works at an average job, and now finds himself entering middle-age with heavy debt and his future now looks fairly bleak. His girlfriend dumps him. He decides to kill himself by jumping off a bridge and that's when his adventure begins.The main female character suffers from an acute social anxiety disorder and refuses contact with the outside world, even with her family. She lives in a room of her parents' house and texts them whenever she needs something. She never opens her doors (she locks them) except when she needs to wash and use the bathroom.Based on the above, you can see where this story is going.The female character is played beautifully by Jung Ryo Won. It isn't an easy character to play. But she comes off not as a crazy nut, but as a deeply vulnerable character who goes to the extreme to shelter herself from the strains of the world. I was very convinced of her character and I was impressed with Jung Ryo Won's acting ability.I felt the director and the writers could have left few nauseous scene out. There is a scene when the male character licks his body for salt and even gathers his sweat for salt flavoring (ewwww). That imagery almost ruined the movie for me.Here are the subtleties you may have missed if you are non-Korean:1)The noodle in the movie is called JaJangMyun. Its delivery is like pizza-delivery in the US and the Koreans consume hundreds of millions of that dish every year (it is quite delicious). The JaJangMyun delivery man is often obsessed with getting the plastic bowl back and nothing pisses him off more than not getting that bowl back (most delivery service now deliver in a disposable bowl). I won't ruin it here by explaining why that's relevant, but that fact comes into play in the funniest scene of the movie.2)The two main characters communicate in English. In one scene, the male character says in English, ""You are Korean, I am Korean, and we speak in English..."" This is meant to be a criticism of modern Korea, which is so obsessed with learning English that people often talk to each other in English to improve their skill. The two characters only communicate in English until the very end.3)The air-attack drill scenes are indeed enforced twice a year to prepare for possible North Korean attack. The movie states they are done twice a year but never explains why the Koreans do the drill.",Castaway on the Moon (Standard Edition) DVD
1425972,"First a quick word:  After reading the other reviews about the camera madness, I was really reluctant to purchase this.  I had it in my cart, deleted it, ordered it, tried to cancel, but didn't get to it in time.  Bottom line, I am really glad that I bought it.  The camera's in my opinion are not crazy.  There are alot of point of view changes, double screens, sometimes triple split screens, but camera madness?  I didn't feel that way at all.  Once I got used to the POV changes, the concert flowed and I liked the tempo of the changes and face it, these guys move around, especially Angus.  It's ACDC!Now why I rated five stars.  The picture is amazing playing through a ps3 on a new HDTV, I was truly happy with the picture quality, so amazingly bright and clear, and the sound, is also incredible, so clear in fact you can hear every nuance of Angus playing, even the occasional flubs (it happens to everyone once in a while!).  All in all, this band is still great live, such high energy, such great songs.  I thought the song choice was right on, this was in support of Black Ice, so why would they not play songs from it???  When you have a band with such a prolific career you are not going to satisfy everyone when a setlist is concerned.  Also there were a few cute moments, the ""strip tease"" of Angus and the devil horns.  As stated by other reviewers these fans are high energy and SO excited.  Their jubilance was a great part of this show, they deserve a star all on their own!!!  Where can I get a pair of those devil horns??I nearly forgot to talk about the extra features, forgive me!  The backstage features are :  The Fan, The Roadie and the Guitar Tech and the Meat.  And another featuring the animation they used on the big screens.  I enjoy the sections on the fans, there are some pretty wild fans in Argentina!  So many slept out there overnight in storms and rain to get the best seats they could.  Music really does unite people all over the world  I also  love the backstage looks.  They  had a soccer game the night before the concert and had to work two overnight crewss to get the stadium ready for ACDC, this was a huge show and required alot of work.  I love seeing the stage builds, preparation, the guys coming out and getting a look at everything as it goes up.  You see all those shots here and hear from the roadies and the guitar techs.  You get shots of the setlist, guitar setups, interviews with many different people associated with putting on the show, including the film producer who talks about selecting Argentina and the challenges of setting up filming.  You get to see them filming.  Some very cool extras I must say.  I also loved the animation (pink floyd and ozzy use animation on big screens too and I dig it)All in all the product deserves five stars, afterall, when it comes to blu-ray it's all about is it worth the money for the picture and sound, I haven't viewed the DVD but I would say YES.One thought, they  had a very cool long cat walk with an extra stage in the center, this was used only once by Angus, during an extended guitar solo/jam.  Brian occasionally went about half way along the catwalk, but I wondered why they didn't utilize it more.  Just a random ??Anyway, I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.  What a great band, I wish I had been there.  Both ACDC and Argentina know how to rock.",N/A

If you can't tell by Birdy's expression on the box cover you're in for some stuff with this one.This season focuses more on Birdy and her past.

It never becomes clear what demons Gilbert is wrestling with, she doesn't seem to really learn anything from her travels, and the big questions of life are barely even hinted at, much less seriously engaged.  Having sugary Julia Roberts play Gilbert only makes all of this worse. And to top it off, the movie is drainingly boring, with even the scenery failing to generate interest.  In short, the movie lacks both substance *and* style.I hope the book is better than the movie.

1396508,"(Mr J. Lovin's review is for another movie altogether).This is a true western in widescreen color with a darn good remastering job. Better than some I've seen lately. They knew how to make westerns in the '50's and this is a classic example. Two guys formerly of Quantrell's Raiders are secretly released from Texas incarceration to join up with the remnants of the Raiders in Arizona to help capture them. Audie Murphy, who does a good job here, is conflicted as to whether he should join the newly formed Arizona Rangers headed by Buster Crabbe, or head for Mexico.With lots of action and riding through great western scenery, this movie almost feels like an epic story. You might think this is all about raiders, rangers and cavalry - groups of men fighting each other, and there is that, but really, it is about 2 guys trying to find their way after the Civil War. It's what makes it a good solid western. I've seen this before in 4x3 blurry vhs quality. It is far more impressive this way. It's like watching a totally different movie.",N/A

1414988,"Well, here we are, number two of the four big super hero films of the summer. And it is... pretty damn decent.X-Men: First Class centers around a younger Charles Xavier and his new friend, Erik Lehnsherr and their efforts to stop Sebastian Shaw. Shaw has a plan to start a nuclear war so that the radiation will cause more mutations in people. Apparently that's how mutants got their start, which is somewhat confusing since the opening scene (lifted directly from the first X-Men film, a movie which came out, good grief, 11 years ago), shows Erik in 1943, a couple years before nuclear bombs were going off. But never mind. Along the way to stopping Shaw, X picks up several recruits including scientist Hank McCoy, a woman with dragonfly wings, a boy who can scream even louder than the children in my apartment complex (and who looks like an escapee from a Weasly family reunion), and a black guy. Guess what happens to him? Efforts to recruit a cigar smoking Canadian are not as successful.There is an awful lot that I liked about this movie. First James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do an excellent job playing younger versions of characters made popular by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. Nicholas Hoult also continues to impress, showing that his performance in Skins isn't an aberration. The other members of the cast are also quite good, including Kevin Bacon and January Jones, though I kept seeing her as a naughty Betty Draper more than anything else. The cast is further helped by the fact that Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones and Luc Till are all exceptionally easy on the eyes. There was also some lovely continuity between this movie and the others, though I'm sure some people will bitch about certain errors that crept in.Really the only problems this movie had were that it was a bit longer than it needed to be, and a bit more crowded. We didn't really need all that many mutants up on the screen. Havoc, especially, was adorable but could have been written out without damaging the movie in any way. There were also a couple of very odd edits where it's clear certain scenes were meant to go longer than they did, and instead were just awkwardly chopped. It's also very clear that this is a setup for a new franchise, and while I don't have a huge problem with that, it does cause its own set of problems.That said, it was fun summer escapism. I liked it a bit more than Thor, but it's really apples and oranges with those two. Also, don't bother staying to the end of the credits hoping for a nice Easter egg, cause you won't get one. But stay until the end anyhow, cause the people who make these movies work hard!",N/A
1334467,"After five and a half hours - a full seven episodes - of this addicting reality show, you're likely to look around your own home and feel a little bit better about the clutter you may have. ""Hoarders"" - a reality show in the best sense of the term - features people (and sometimes couples) suffering from a debilitating compulsive disorder that prevents them from being able to part with pretty much anything. But these aren't just people who happen to have a lot of junk lying around, these are people on the verge of personal crisis - some are facing foreclosure, some are in danger of having their children taken away, some already have had their children taken away, and one especially incredible case features a man who is facing jail time unless he cleans up his property. Each case is unique and intriguing and though no two hoarders are the same, there's a clear throughline in the show - despite constant signs of distress and looming personal risks, these people are often unable to part with even the simplest objects.Each episode begins with a brief description of the disorder - which seems to include a mix of obsessive-compulsive disorder among other things - and covers two cases each, usually of hoarders with very different problems. For example, the finale includes a child who can't throw away even a single cotton ball on one hand and a grandfather with a few acres of scrap metal (including a full school bus!) on the other. The juxtaposition of the two cases in each episode keeps the show moving, especially as it becomes clear who will benefit from the assistance the crew on the show are offering and who will not. The show features a rotating crew of psychologists, moving crews, and professional organizers who show up at the designated hoarding houses and attempt to help the afflicted person(s) purge their houses. As often as not the attempts to help are unsuccessful, and though this can be frustrating as a viewer, it's also a testament to how intense the illness is. At the end of each episode there is a brief follow-up to say what the final outcome was of the intervention. These are especially interesting, though I often wished these bits were a bit more in-depth, particularly for those who had the most trouble letting go of anything.The 2-disc season one collection features a few minutes of extra footage from each episode, and once you've gotten through the show you'll be more than intrigued by what could have been filmed but left out. The series will soon be in its second season on A&E; and after sitting through the first season in a single sitting (maybe I have a bit of the obsessive-compulsive disorder myself!) I'm already ready for more. If you get a chance to check this show out, don't miss it.

254429,"Will Vinton brings his creative genius to the task of bringing complexity and depth to the work of Mark Twain. He does this via putting his Claymation Twain on a hot air steamship to rendezvous with Halley's Comet in 1910, the year of Twain's death. Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher stow away and are subject to Twain's wry observations and humor. Unbeknownst to the kids, Twain's evil twin is also on board, trying to scuttle the journey. The confusion between the works and words of ""light"" Twain and ""dark"" Twain account for some of the journey's dramatic moments.I would have expected a Twain film to highlight Twain's great works - Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. But these are mostly missing, except for a terrifying cameo by Injun Joe. Instead, Twain's lesser known, more difficult and adult-oriented works are highlighted - Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven, The Diary of Adam and Eve and Letters from the Earth. The last, with a terrifying Satan playing life and death games with little clay people, is extremely dark and creepy.Kudos to Vinton for trying to being the ""real"" Twain to life. And kudos with bringing Twain's more difficult works to public notice. Bravo for putting Twain's own sayings into this character's mouth -- though some, like ""as surprised as a Presbyterian in Hell"" are dated and almost impossible to comprehend. Congrats also with showing a man in his humorous and evil-tempered sides. Congrats also for daring to poke pointed fun at Heaven and Hell with any audience.But is this a kid's movie? The subtitle, ""Where dreams become reality,"" seems to suggest this, but is pretty misleading. There is nothing in the story about dreams becoming true -- other than Twain's morbid expectation that he would go out with the comet as he came in with it. And the odd choice of offbeat Twain material makes this a poor choice for introducing kids to the great author. Not to mention that what was included would be nightmare materials for many kids. I think even some 12-year-olds would find this stuff too much to handle.Yet ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" is extremely well made and innovative, if a bit pokey in the dialog. If anything, it will give non-kids a sense of the mature (and often religious) themes that obsessed Twain. Watch the movie, then pick up ""The gospel according to Mark Twain"" to get the full treatment of his often funny, often insightful musings about religion.",Adventures of Mark Twain VHS
935210,"The title ""Billy the Kid Versus Dracula"" probably stirs images in your head of fangs and bullets battling it out in the west..... the OLD west. Saloons, coffins, the lawless, bats, this all sounds as if it were to be the classic cinema fight.While those images are entertaining, you will not find that here. Look at this film more as a romantic western comedy.Or, just Romantic in general.You've got an old guy chasing a blonde who happens to be dating an ex-murderer/robber, it's the ideal love-triangle!There's really only one physical fight between Billy and Dracula (it's laughably poor, anti-climatic), the rest of the film is just the two trying for the heart of an 18 and beautiful blonde.The copy I received was in obvious poor quality. Came off as if it were a beaten-up vhs tape, with the opening difficult to make out. I'm not too huge into quality, but even someone such as myself fount it to be rough, yet viewable for the most part.There were no extras on the DVD.Came in traditional DVD case.Anyways, fun film for cheap thrills.

1044395,"THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING revolves around a young man named Doug (David de Vos) and the relationship that grows between himself and a man named Gene (Victor Lundin).  Doug is a pilot and the owner of a flight school. His school is doing well, but some delayed payments threaten to destroy his thriving business. He has been spending so much time at work that his wife Abby (Frances Black) feels neglected and spends most of her time eating junk food and watching soap operas.  A few weeks for Christmas, Doug receives a telephone call informing him that his biological father wants to contact him.  He agrees to meet the man whose real name is Eugene Holland. Gene was a former award-winning scientist who became a hermit after the death of his wife, Doug's birth mother. Gene has been spending the past thirty years working on a ""theory of everything"", a theory that unites all the mathematical and physical theories of the universe.  Gene is very close to succeeding, but he needs help. Unbeknownst to Doug, Gene is dying and his request for help is his attempt to finish his masterwork before he dies. The movie attempts to show how close Gene is to finishing his work by displaying Doug using Gene's mathematical and scientific theories to economics to win money from new financial supporters for his flight school. Gene misses his deceases wife dearly and feels that if he can decode the theory of everything, he will be able to open a doorway to heaven itself where he longs to see his wife.  Doug is a Christian who thinks that what Gene is missing is faith in Jesus and lovingly tells him so. In the meantime, Doug's half-sister threatens to ruin everything by having Gene committed for mental instability.Though it's not initially apparent, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a Christian movie. What that means is that a sermon (though not one in church) is contained in part of the movie and there is a ""come to Jesus"" moment where a character makes a declaration of faith. This isn't a bad thing, but viewers should be aware of it. Those moments are handled more believably in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING than they usually are in Christian movies. The ""sermon"" isn't very preachy and the character's conversion is one that actually seems natural.David de Vos does a good job as Doug. He also directed, wrote, and co-produced the movie. Victor Lundin gives the best performance in the movie. I enjoyed watching the scenes he was involved in the most.I understand the confines of low budget, independent filmmaking. However, even taking that into consideration there are some obvious flaws to THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. The story is actually fairly good, but the way the story is told isn't.  There are gaps in the movie that wouldn't have been so awkward with a little more explanation. For instance, Doug was an adopted child but the word ""adopted"" is never really mentioned, it's hinted at but never spoken. There are other parts of the movie that don't make much sense.  The biggest being the reappearance of Doug's half-sister. Towards the beginning of the movie she agrees to give up any responsibility or relationship she has with Gene. Then she suddenly reappears in a dramatic fashion towards the end of movie where her husband batters Doug's daughter in the presence of a couple of police officers. Conflict is essential for any good story, but it should be conflict that actually makes sense. In all honesty, her reappearance was unnecessary and the story would be smoother and more coherent without it.The other major flaw of THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING was the cinematography.  During most of the major conversations in the movie, some of the smaller ones, and many of the movie's key moments the camera revolves around the characters over and over and over. The technique is supposed to give the viewer a sense of omniscience, but it is overused in the movie and made me dizzy at times.Despite these flaws, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a movie that many will enjoy. It's a movie with a strong message that has no sex, foul language, and minimal violence so families will probably enjoy watching this together. It's also not as preachy as most Christian movies. With a decent script and good acting from the movie's leads, I wanted to really enjoy THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, but I only found it ho-hum. The gaps and nonsensical moments of the storytelling grated on me and I found the oft-used circular use of the camera to be annoying. Personally, I think the movie is a good effort, but one that doesn't meet its potential.",N/A

I found far too many easy coincidences, such as the ridiculous number of preserved photo negatives from a 1966 parade in a nowhere town in Sweden that allow the disgraced journo and his punk g-friend to solve a 40-year-old murder. And the convenient stacks of 1960s Vander Co. business records, containing just the right clues, were another absurdity for me. I appreciated the hint at such a multi-layered mystery, but in the end I was not convinced by the reality. This could not have happened in real life, so I was not transported. It's also hard to see how someone could disappear to Australia and never be found until just the right moment. The leading man here is not much of an actor, either. He is semi-expressionless throughout, as is the girl of the title. Others find her performance great. I just thought it was one-dimensional. All the computer hocus-pocus seems unreal as well. not to mention the get-even finale which also depends on an absurd amount of written records all coming together thanks to the ""genius"" girl researcher.

1430632,"In arguably the performance of her life, Florence Henderson (Brady Bunch) stars as an eccentric, rough-around-the-edges farmwoman who nurses bunnies back to health.A troubled foster child named Julia has been tossed from home to home, largely because she won't speak and obsessively watches an old videotape of The Velveteen Rabbit. Her foster families don't know what to do with her--and Julia's Mom is a drug addict incapable of caring for her.Enter a loving but fallen-on-hard-times family that includes an out-of-work engineer for a father, a stay-at-home furniture-painting mom and an adolescent boy who have decided to take on a foster child (doing double duty for additional income and filling a void in the mom's heart).The caseworkers place Julia with the family, but the transition isn't smooth--especially because of Julia's lack of communication and anti-social behavior.During the holidays, cousins come over and an uncle gets the boy a BB gun. They run out in the woods and start shooting at birds--and end up injuring a bunny. Julia takes to the bunny and the family rush the animal to the vet.Barring an expensive operation, the bunny has little chance. However, the vet knows a woman who's a ""Bunny Lady""...a rabbit whisperer, if you will. The family goes to the Bunny Lady's farm and get a chilly reception, but she agrees to keep it and try to mend it.Unbeknownst to her family, Julia gets off at a different bus stop (which worries them): it's at the Bunny Lady's farm. The Bunny Lady allows Julia to visit every day, and she teaches Julia how to care for the rabbits.When the bratty boys take the healed bunny and decide to put it in one of their ""sleighs"" to push down a steep snow hill they made, Julia screams--and bites one of the boys...and then runs away deep into the forest on a bitterly cold evening.The rest of the movie shows how a family's love (and a rabbit's!) breaks through to a sad, mistrustful, lonely little girl--and how a grown man learns humility for the sake of his family and how a bitter widow's heart softens towards humanity.The Christmas Bunny isn't a saccharine holiday tale (despite receiving Five out of Five Doves from the Dove Foundation), and does have a few unsettling moments. Still, it's a redemptive, well-acted movie likely to elicit more than a few tears, as well as feelings of thankfulness for family and community.-- Janet Boyer, author of lots of stuff",The Christmas Bunny
411434,"If you want to know every aspect of the plot, etc., read other reviews.I just want to give some thoughts...The Cutting Edge (1992) is my favorite romantic comedy of all time.  It's funny, entertaining, serious, and emotional all wrapped into one great movie.  The acting is outstanding.  The best acting comes from, well, everybody.  My personal favorite is Moira Kelly's portrayal of an ice skater with a spoiled brat attitude, Kate Moseley.  D.B Sweeney also does a great job as  conceited ex-hockey star-turned-figure skater, Doug Dorsey.  Supporting actors Terry O'Quinn as Kate's father Jack Moseley and Roy Dotrice as figure skating coach Anton Pamchenko also perform great.My favorite part of the movie is the argument that takes place about the ""button"".  I find it humorous and serious at the same time.  I also like the ""double or nothing"" and ""finger painting"" scenes.I saw this movie in the theater probably seven times back in 1992.  I had never seen the same movie in a theater more than twice before.  In the years since this movie came out, I still haven't seen the same movie in a theater more than twice.If you want to watch a different kind of romantic comedy that is many things rolled into one, then give The Cutting Edge a try.  I highly recommend this great film.",The Cutting Edge VHS
1376520,"WWEBRAGGING RIGHTS 2010Spoilers1.DANIEL BRYAN VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-what an incredible match up to kick things off with. These two put on a brilliant performance each in a show stealing match. This match is so well done with both working their respective styles and making them compliment one another. This match is back and forth near fall after near fall and the crowd is way into it. Bryan ends up winning this putting Raw up one to nothing but everybody won with this one.2.[TAG TEAM TITLE]CODY RHODES & DREW MCINTYRE VS JOHN CENA & DAVID OTUNGA-this is of course is when Cena was forced into being a member of The Nexus. Honesty The Nexus was such a great storyline starting out but they let it just fade out. After Cody and Drew come out and claim there is no one worthy of a title shot Nexus leader Wade Barrett [who is great as a heel] introduces Otunga and Cena as the title contenders. Otunga started the match out but would soon tag Cena in, Cena then stayed in the rest of the match. Cena battles back and forth with the champs to finally sink in the STF to win the titles. Afterwards he attacks fellow Nexus partner Otunga before heading to the back.Love Matt Striker here as they are hyping the next match, the guy cracks me up, just watch him as Cole is talking. I wish Striker would come back as a full time announcer.3.GOLDUST VS TED DIBIASE-I have always been a fan of Goldust and I really hope they do more with him. His first run in the WWF was excellent as he was a great I-C champ in my opinion. Any way I liked the storyline going into this as Dust was finally being used again on a regular basis. Pretty good match here between these two with a good pace. Both come off well here but the big story was the ladies getting into it, this of course cost Goldust the match. Of course they also are to blame for Dibiase taking a final cut after the match.4.[DIVA'S TITLE]LAYLA VS NATALYA-LayCool just cracks me up every time they do their thing, ""flawless"". Any way of course I am a huge Natalya fan as she is coming out of the Hart family. Love Natalya's shout out to her dad The British Bulldog [R.I.P.] as you will see. Natalya is all power and high impact moves while Layla is more about breaking her down with submissions and such. After McCool interferes Layla keeps the title within LayCool.5.[BURIED ALIVE WORLD TITLE]KANE VS THE UNDERTAKER-this was by far Kane's best year in forever really. In fact this may have been Kane's best and strongest storyline since he debuted and was smashing everyone. Kane of course was on a great winning streak against his brother and was World Champ at this point. I was a fan of this storyline and saw the whole Paul Bearer thing coming but still it was fun. This match was just what it should have been, a fight. A match like this is supposed to be every where and more of a brawl than anything else. Plus these two put on a good match and it ended like a lot of these matches do, interference for the heel to win. Kane keeps the belt after Nexus attacks Taker costing him the win and title.6.[ELIMINATION MATCH]THE MIZ, CM PUNK, JOHN MORRISON, R-TRUTH, EZEKIEL JACKSON, & SANTINO MARELLA VS BIG SHOW, EDGE, REY MYSTERIO, KOFI KINGSTON, JACK SWAGGER, ALBERTO DEL RIO, & TYLER REKS-now for the longest time the two brands have gone at it at one point during the year every year. Some times it has been at one of there shows or maybe at the Survivor Series all the way to this PPV made for it. I have actually liked this concept though some years it is executed better than others. I think each time it would be better if something was on the line each time other than brand pride. Like if you participate and win all surviving members will get a title shot on an episode of their respective show or something. Like these matches always are it was pure fun and full of action, never a dull moment. Also listen to the commentary on this match as the real heat between Striker and them is obvious here at points. There are all kinds of high spots here and some great stories being told like Mysterio and Del Rio in particular. Of course you know I love The Miz and CM Punk so it is great always going back to this and seeing them here. I also loved Alex taking that hit for Miz, still it is not enough as Edge and Rey survive after a great match.7.[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS WADE BARRETT-the main event of the night would see then leader of The Nexus Wade Barrett trying to take the title off of Randy Orton. John Cena who was now a tag champ was forced to be in Barrett's corner and was told that if Wade lost he would be fired. So the match kicks off and for what it is it is a pretty good match. I am a big fan of Barrett so you know I was cheering for him here, the action here is a bit of a brawl. The Nexus hit the ring at one point only to be attacked by Cena, and afterwards he gave Wade the AA. In doing so Randy was DQ'd and Cena kept his job since Barrett won.Over all this was a good event that I enjoyed though not an epic event it did have some good matches. Special features include an interview with team Smackdown and Taker's last ride.",N/A
1290876,"This was an excellent movie, from the story to the acting, to even the camera work. It was a very touching piece. Mainly it was about how different people deal with the loss of a family member. And this didn't mean the death of one for all the characters. Clive Owen gave a brilliant performance as (Joe Warr)a grieving and now single father or a precocious little boy. He did drink heavily at first, but once he realized he had to deal with being a father he decided to become more mature. You couldn't ask for more from the six-year-old Nicholas McAnulty that played Artie. He was funny and cute and ill-tempered in just the right ways. He was the embodiment of how children do not know how to deal with the death of someone close. As for his older son from his first marriage. His name was Harry, he was played masterfully by George MacKay. This character was supposed to be moody and burned by his father's leaving him with his mother, who was now moved on with her life and had very little room for Harry in it. This is why he was so angry with his father. George portrayed all of this emotion quite brilliantly. He was the right person for this role. And has a promising future as an actor. He was angry and teen-age ""I'm mad at my father"" moody, and mature, and pleasant to his half brother... all in just the right ways. The only thing I hold against this movie, is that Joe was seemingly interested in another woman and it was never pursued.

The story centers around 15-year-old Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), who suffers through the pangs of adolescence which includes seeing his parents' marriage about to crumble (mom Jill is played by Sally Hawkins and dad Lloyd is played by Noah Taylor). This fact is not helped when mom's ex-boyfriend becomes their next-door neighbor.As he struggles with this issue, Oliver is also facing problems at school - he is not the most popular kid, and becomes romantically attracted to Jordana Bevan (Yasmin Paige), a dark-haired beauty who is not above tormenting the weaker ones amongst the student population. Despite this, Oliver is hopelessly drawn to Jordana and goes about trying to win her heart.Frankly, I did not find the central characters very likable, but the storyline is interesting and the cast does a credible job in their respective performances.

I liked it with us showing Reid developing the Green Hornet rather than in the shows with Green Hornet as is. However, the flaw with the series was always the villeins were really not very impressive, simply put they were ordinary criminals for the most part with little characater or charisma. They could do a bit better with better villeins and characters. Since the Green Hornet did a cameo and a guest star in one episode on Adam West's Batman, I would love to see the next film with the Green Hornet mixing it up with Batman like they have with Batman and Superman.

26438,"""Charade"" may very well be the best Hitchcock film not directed by Hitchcock. Minus a psychological subtext as powerful as those in ""Notorious"" and ""North by Northwest"", Stanley Donen's beautifully paced thriller is most comparable to Hitch's ""To Catch a Thief"", starring as it does Cary Grant opposite a considerably younger but supremely stylish actress (Grace Kelly in the former, Audrey Hepburn in the current film)in a travelogue perfect locale (Monte Carlo,Paris). The stars are complemented by a fine cast of future Oscar winning supporting actors, Walter Matthau, George Kennedy and James Coburn, all playing murder-on-their- minds villains.Beginning with Henry Mancini's catchy pop title song and Maurice Binder's Bondian titles, ""Charade"" has never looked more cinematic than on Criterion's gorgeous Blu-ray iteration. Audrey Hepburn displays exquisite class not only in her Givenchy wardrobe, but in the verbal ping pong she plays with the intriguing Cary Grant, a man of no less than 4 identities. As did Joan Fontaine in ""Suspicion"", Hepburn must grapple with the existential question, ""Is Cary Grant trying to kill me?"" From the opening sequence in which the first victim is hurled from a speeding train in his pajamas,(a recurrent motif in the film), ""Charade"" betrays a Hitchcockian fascination with trains and public landmarks (Notre Dame, the Champs Elysees) and a love for double entendres. Peter Stone's witty script has the future lovers meeting cute, thanks to a water pistol, and developing their relationship through a series of sight and verbal gags involving food, which satisfy several viewer appetites all at once.With its vivid colors, sharp editing, crackling good score and sound effects, but above all with its beautiful stars in beautiful locales, ""Charade"" is the next best thing to a visit to Paris itself.",N/A

The twenty-two episodes of the show's second season is overall a mixed bag, with many of the show's strenghts continuing to be in evidence, and many of the show's weaknesses still present.  There has been a tendency among some fans of the show to overly idealize the first season, in particular the first thirteen episodes, a tendency I would overall reject.  I don't think overall that the second season represents a notable drop in quality from the first.  However, the show's shakier aspects (particularly in terms of narrative and character continuity) have continued to be evident, and I think fans are increasingly demanding that the show improve in those respects.  Some spoilers follow.Whereas the first season was split into two halves that saw New Directions go to its Sectional and Regional competitions (which made the outcome of the latter contest rather obvious from a structural standpoint), this season has a three-way split:  Sectionals (episode 9), Regionals (episode 16), and Nationals (episode 22), and announces from the start that the Nationals competition this year will be in New York City.  This predetermines the outcome of the earlier contests, but that likewise wouldn't surprise anyone, given that the club's existence depends on their winning the first two contests anyway.  However, the majority of the season is given over to two focuses:  couples drama, and gay-related Issues plotlines.Concerning the former, some of it is well-done (mostly the gay ones; see below), but in many instances it becomes extremely repetitive and trying on patience.  This is particularly pronounced in the case of the show's supposed central coupling, Rachel (Lea Michele) and Finn (Cory Monteith).  Originally they were supposed to be together all season, but instead they broke up a little less than halfway through and spent the rest of it orbiting each other; the writers dredged up last year's obstacles again (Quinn [Dianna Agron], in an excruciatingly illogical plot, and Jesse [Jonathan Groff]), and their final reconciliation just spotlights how little their stories had advanced in a year.  They more or less redo the first year's finale in the second.  And the back half of the season does neither character any favours:  Finn, who was cheated on by Quinn last year and broke up with Rachel over an incident of cheating, then persuades Quinn to cheat on Sam with him; this gigantic hypocrisy goes unremarked on by all; Rachel, meanwhile, becomes a pathetic hanger-on.  If these characters are going to be together, then let them be together and develop their stories; it is no coincidence that easily the best Finn/Rachel storyline of the season is in ""Duets"", them working together to achieve a common goal.  Various other romantic couplings occur, such as Tina/Mike [Jenna Ushkowitz/Harry Shum, Jr.], which is more or less ignored from the moment it begins; and Puck/Lauren [Mark Salling/Ashley Fink], which is a surprisingly successful comic courtship.Then there are the gay stories.  ""Glee"" attracted some controversy in Year Two from people who thought it was ""too gay"", an idea I categorically reject; given the paucity of gay representation on TV (though that's improving), the idea that one of America's major teen-oriented TV shows would embrace gay issues is laudable in the extreme.  This complaint, I think, is partly a manifestation of a more valid complaint:  that the writers don't give the straight characters the same care and attention that they do to the gay ones.  Particularly with Kurt (Chris Colfer), the only character who is allowed a major season-long storyline and a genuine parental presence (Mike O'Malley as Burt); there's an obvious gulf between the quality of the material here.  Kurt's search for a boyfriend (who arrives in the form of Blaine Anderson, played by Darren Criss) is a reasonably well-done story.  Criss is an energetic addition to the cast.  More problematic is the gay bullying storyline, which greatly confuses the issue by ultimately becoming about redeeming a closeted gay kid who bullies (and who is consequently more or less let off scot-free for his behaviour).  There's also a pronounced double-standard between the now-serious treatment of Kurt's bullying and the farcical depiction of the bullying of everyone else - ammunition for people who think the show is slanted in Kurt's favour.  Also in the gay front, pleasingly, the show finally stops pretending that Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) are straight, and in the second half of the season they take centre-stage more and more; and this well-executed story carries quite a bit of the latter half of the year, making great use of two of the show's best talents.Acting-wise, this is probably Colfer's season; I wouldn't be at all surprised if he wins the Emmy for his contributions here.  Rivera, as Santana, is close behind; finally given the chance to play Santana as more than just a bitchy mean girl, she is astonishingly poignant.  The ""Landslide"" and locker confession scenes in episode 15 are truly amazing pieces of acting, and, in a just world, would also put Rivera in major awards contention (though she'll likely be blocked by co-star Jane Lynch as the show's nominee in the supporting actress field).  Lynch, meanwhile, suffers greatly in comparison with season one; Sue is increasingly irrelevant to the show, and it's emblematic of this that a number of the season's best episodes (""Duets"", ""Silly Love Songs"", ""Born This Way"") don't include here at all.  Heather Morris, like Rivera, gets an expanded role, and, though she has some shaky bits, eventually proves to be surprisingly credible as a dramatic actress as well as a comedienne.  Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, and Matthew Morrison (Mr. Schuester) continue to do good work, but they're underserved by their material this year.Superb music, vibrant characters, and writing that is capable of being very affecting; at the same time, paired with shaky narratives and sometimes ill-judged stories.  ""Glee"" continues to be a good show that is just shy of being truly great.  With a larger writing staff being hired for next year, one hopes they can improve further, particularly is this is indeed the last time with the original cast.",N/A

The acting by the two leads is spot-on just right and the screenplay and direction are also very effective. This is a film with fascinating visuals and background. I learned allot about working on a farm - and it was interesting to me. There is an almost documentary style at work here in which the budding male-male romance fits in comfortably.

1325503,"""You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home."" After being away from home for a long long time Tommy (Hardy) comes back to see his father Paddy (Nolte). Across town his brother Brendan (Edgerton) is having financial troubles. The only way the two brothers can find a way to make the money they need is by fighting in an MMA tournament. Tommy asks his father to train him and the family dysfunction grows until the tournament. Regardless of what I say here this is a great movie. My problem with this is that I think my expectations were too high. Any movie that draws comparisons to ""Rocky"" gets my hopes up (like ""The Fighter""). Much like ""Rocky"" though, this movie has the fighting as a secondary plot to the family struggles that are going on. This movie is very interesting in the way that you are not sure who is the ""good"" brother and are not really sure who to root for the entire time. If you have seen ""The Fighter"" you may agree with me when I say that the movie was good but Christian Bale's performance made the movie. Nick Nolte gives that kind of performance in this one. He takes a part that could get glossed over and makes it stand out enough that to me he is the front runner for an Oscar. Overall, a very good movie but my expectations were too high to love it as much as I wanted. Of the last ""fighting"" movies to come out I would have to say this is 3rd on my list. After ""The Wrestler"" and ""The Fighter"". Still very much worth watching though. I give it a B+.*Also try - The Fighter & The Wrestler",N/A
1421058,"I have noticed that many have criticized this documentaries as if ""it very much slanted against the Germans and their allies""... First of all, let's say that this is not about Germans or Russians, or any other nationality in particular. There were people among Germans, who disagreed with Hitler's politics, as well as hundreds of thousands of Russians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Georgians, Jews, Armenians and many other nationalities were sent by Stalin prior, during and after WWII to Siberian concentration camps. Second of all, Nazis had no business invading Soviet Union. If a thief comes to my home and I kick him out with a gun point while defending my family and my property, should I emphasize on public that I might be biased against that thief and should I try to persuade the public to support that thief's point of view equally with mine? This is ludicrous! So don't expect people, who were defending their motherland, to do so in this documentaries. Stalin was hiding in Kremlin while many nationalities of all ages (children, teenagers, men and women, elderly) were fighting, starving to death and sacrificing their lives in order to free their homes from those maniacal Nazi thieves. So, let us at least honor the memory of those human beings, who sacrificed their lives and stopped the brown plague from taking over the world. If the Nazis were not stopped then, I doubt that by now anyone would be left alive here to criticize this documentaries.",N/A

970864,"Being an Ape fan from my childhood, I purchased the ultimate collection when it first came out.  I was pleased to go back and watch all the films, the TV series and the animated series.  The audio/video quality of the animated series in the Ultimate Collection was really lacking.  There was hardly any color palette, other than oranges and browns, and it was botched by tons of dust, scratches, and artifacts.  The sound was muddled mono track with pops and hisses.  After years of holding out, I finally broke down and took a chance on double dipping on the remastered animated series.  I popped in the original from the Ultimate Collection, just so I could have a fresh image by which to compare and contrast.  The newer release loads with the same menu design, so no real differences yet.  Once I pushed play on episode one, IMMEDIATELY, my mouth fell open as the differences were glaring right before me.  Colors and details that were not visible in the Ultimate Collection were now presented to my wondering eyes.  I couldn't believe how crisp and clear the images were.  I popped in the old one again just to see it, and was dumbfounded at the stark differences between the two version.  You can now see every brush stroke and pencil line in the animated cells,  Contrast that with the original where everything was blurry and there seemed as if someone had overlaid the whole image with a dark filter.  The audio is still mono, but it too has been cleaned up.  There are still a few examples of some specks here and there, but this is the absolute best I've ever seen this.  Another annoying aspect of the original release was that the whole screen seemed unstable, as it would wiggle and shake.  This is especially noticeable in the opening titles.  That has been corrected, and now you have a stable image without the annoying jiggling.  Fox is truly to be commended for doing such a great job at cleaning up this series that is a fond memory from my childhood.  Of course, since we only had a black and white TV at the time, it is truly a treat to see this series in all its colorful glory.  If you have the Ultimate Collection, you owe it to yourself to spend a little money and get this newly remastered edition.

23888,"This is what I consider to be the epitome of the cutting-edge film genre for many reasons. Case in point: it was banned by the Nazis and then portions were used in propaganda films. I read that the director (Fritz Lang) fled Germany the day he was offered a role in the Nazi film industry (my guess is that his brilliance was too impressive to be ignored and subsequently needed to be manipulated, threatened and controlled). But what I consider most awe-inspiring is the brave, outspoken statement about a terrifying, sensitive and all too common threat - which he dramatically exposed in a very public way. This film was one of the important ground-breaking moments in cinema history.It blows my mind that this was released in 1931. The story is emotionally and politically charged with subject matter that is all too current in the daily news. The term ""serial killer"" is a common phrase today, but that wasn't the case before we had access to national and world events soon after after they occur.I think about the many times I've heard my parents and grandparents say, ""it used to be safe to let your kids out of your sight"" or ""we played outside all day ... but we had to be home for dinner ... and after that, before dark."" A very important message still rings true: we must watch out for others and protect them from predators - who often present themselves in non-threatening forms and then take advantage of the naivety and innocence of their victims. That is true of so many crimes that are committed - an opportunity is seized by an individual with who sees an easy target for their harmful intentions.It's a tragic reality that there are incredibly sick individuals who manage to blend into society long enough to commit deplorable acts before they're (hopefully) caught. This story also delves into the dilemma of attempting to determine whether or not a person is fully responsible for their actions when they are obviously mentally ill. It especially becomes a controversial subject when we're given the opportunity to see that a person who appears to be ""evil incarnate"" seems psychologically incapable of understanding right from wrong.",N/A

I don't know what the problem is why they can't release this good movie. Both Natalie and McQueen are gone now and its so nice to see them in this movie together.

The photography is grainy, the sound is muddy, the editing choppy.  The acting is often amateurish.  There are two possible explanations for these flaws.  (1) This could be the result of a shoestring budget, or (2) it could be a deliberate attempt at cinema verite, or quite possibly both.

It manages to give us nearly everything we could ask for in one film; honour, chivalry, betrayal, love, romance and more besides.This tells the story of William Wallace, who was a Scottish commoner who fought the English for his countries freedom. The actual person existed, although the details of his life are sketchy and this film fills them in without being factually correct. But all that aside I tend not to care about the inaccuracies (although I dislike Hollwood rewriting history) and enjoy this film for what it offers; which is passion.The battle scenes are gruesome (as battle scenes should be) and they are filled with tension. I tend to find them all the more exciting as this film was shot before the excessive use of CGI and you can tell the groups of fighters were actually there and choreographed very well to be filmed.This has an evocative soundtrack, probably one of the best I own, and James Horner manages to compliment the scenes with his style and compositions very well. This is one of those soundtracks I happily enjoy listening to in it's own right.This has excellent direction from Gibson (before he had his meltdown and became the pariah of Hollywood) and shows what a good eye he has for framing and capturing the emotion on screen. This has an excellent cast and Patrick McGoohan is especially good as the ruthless and menacing King of England, Edward the Longshanks.There is plenty of intrigue, double crossing and betrayal to keep you second guessing and shows the mercenary aspects of medieval politics very well. All in all this is a very satisfying film and one I can happily watch again and again (and I do watch this at regular intervals) and whilst it has it's detractors, if you take it in the spirit it was made in, this makes for one exhilarating and spellbinding movie.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",N/A

1432885,"When I first began watching Smallville, I was hooked from the ""Pilot"" episode.  I mean, blown-away, put-in-the-next-DVD-RIGHT NOW! hooked.  As a fan of the Superman character from childhood (running around the living room in my red velcro cape Supes pajamas) into early adulthood (buying the Superman II: Donner Cut just to see those few different scenes!), I was 100% sure that this show would be the new torch to carry the Superman mythology.  I couldn't get enough of the subtle hints at farmboy Clark Kent's coming destiny, his innocent high school crushes/antics, or the bevy of villains (from both movie and comic cannon) that he runs into as a youngster.  Having not yet stumbled into LOST, Smallville was my favorite TV show of all-time.But then, a funny (but ultimately very sad) thing happened: In season five, an incredible episode entitled ""Reckoning"" airs and, once again, takes my breath away.  However, from that point on, a slow bleed begins to take place.  I won't go into details for fear of spoiling certain plotlines, but for the next five seasons of the show, it becomes a shell of its earlier self.  Gone is the tight writing, well-developed characters, and epic Clark Kent journey, replaced instead by predictable plots, shallow characters (most of the main figures are not even around by the last few seasons), and a wishy-washy path for Clark to become the Man of Steel.Thus, while I recommend the first five (MAYBE seven) seasons of Smallville as high as I possibly can, the final 3-5 seasons are no better than 2-3 stars.  As such, the incredible quality of those early seasons allows me to give this set 4-stars, but I would recommend going on a season-to-season basis, allowing you to choose when to drop out.  I ""stayed the course"", but suffered through 2-3 atrocious seasons as a result.  Buying this set may subject you to the same.",Smallville: The Complete Series
3320,"A staunch supporter of the original ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" I was more than a little intrigued when an updating was announced. A true piece of television history for five seasons of groundbreaking drama, the modernization certainly had a lot to live up to. So I was very surprised that this promised series only had three episodes--and it was actually a sequel of sorts as opposed to a re-imagining. Well, the truth of the matter is--this version definitely lacks the bite and complexity of the original series. But with such a limited running time, I suppose that was to be expected. However, the resultant product (while perhaps not the stuff of TV legend) is a fitfully entertaining confection in its own right. Glossy, well produced, well acted--this version may be slightly superficial, but it sure is likable enough.Set several years after 165 Eaton Place closed it doors, the current series is set in 1936 at the precipice of world conflict. New inhabitants (Ed Stoppard and Keeley Hawes) move onto the premises and must rebuild the house to its former glory. Hawes enlists the aid of an employment specialist (Jean Marsh reprising the infamous role of Rose, but with a bit less pluck) to staff the quarters. Complicating matters, the indomitable Eileen Atkins (cue expected Emmy nomination) is on hand as the free spirited, but strong willed mother in law. The introductory episode plays largely to comedic conventions as Hawes and Atkins engage in subtle warfare. Each episode gets progressively darker, with the rise of fascism playing as the predominant plot point in the second show. And for the finale, things wrap up pretty conveniently for everyone. This is not meant to be a dark historical treatment--the unpleasant backdrop is really secondary to the antics of the cast. It's entertaining soap opera mayhem against the backdrop of history.Again, forty years from now, this won't be considered the enduring classic that its predecessor is. But that's really not its intent. The cast is fun and engaging--there isn't quite the pronounced distinction between Upstairs and Downstairs that helped define the original. Funny and touching, it's hard not to be enchanted by this show even with its more fluffy approach. I thought everyone was great--but once again, Atkins takes the prize for most valuable player. Haughty, hysterical, and surprisingly down to earth--she will be what I remember most about this contemporary visit to the legendary 165 Eaton Place. And if you haven't seen the original, do so.

548583,"I really enjoyed this series, mostly of Raymond Chandlers earlier shorter stories that were not made into feature length films.  Powers Booth is an excellent phillip marlowe, the dialogue is preserved well from the written stories.  On the outside the stories might seem a little complicated, they are not filmed like other mysteries where the viewer can try to guess the overall MO and/or identity of the murderer(s). And alot happens in a short time, leaving the viewer with few clues.  The REAL DEAL is always left until the end and only Phillip Marlowe can figure it out!  The quality of the DVD is ok.  There are no subtitles, or closed captioning (it wouldn't work on my TV anyway), sometime you have to rewind and turn up the volume to catch the clever quips.  In one story, for instance, a lady is passed out and snoring.  Well the snoring isn't just quiet background noise, it makes it hard to hear the actual dialogue of the two persons in the room with her.  Is this a DVD flaw or on purpose by the film makers to emphasize her loud snoring?? I'm not sure but it makes the scene unforgettable.","Philip Marlowe, Private Eye Collection VHS"

Certainly didn't end as well as the book by far.  Scenes between characters barely exist.  If you like action, you'll love the film.  It's filled with it.I would much rather have seen more of the story line, and much less of the action.  There was practically no story line at all. Just a chase and get 'em scene, blast and fire, death after death, one after the other.I always liked the earlier DVD's the best because the stories were good and matched the book pretty quite well.

234347,"If you're looking for a pick-me-up movie--or even a film with a feel-good resolution--then by all means pass by DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.  The timeless story about a couple floating in a sea of booze, as their lives subsequently unravel, is harsh and bitter; in a word, sobering.  Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick play Joe and Kirsten Clay, an up and coming couple about to pursue the American Dream.  Except Joe can't resist those company martini lunches and after-hours excursions; soon he's convinced Kirsten to join him, and before long the alcohol has taken center stage in their lives--with both in denial there's a problem.  As the couple becomes more dysfunctional, as their lives spin further out of control, Joe realizes they need help; he even climbs on the wagon a time or two, always to fall off at Kirsten's urging.  As the film concludes, Joe realizes he must make a choice--Kirsten, or sobriety.  His decision is, again, in a word, sobering.Lemmon and Remick give excellent performances as the besotted couple, yet had the gushy melodrama been dialed down a notch the story would have been so much more believable.  For example, Joe not only gets drunk--he gets maniacally out of control to the point of violent destruction.  I realize the film's premise is to establish the horrific byproducts of alcoholism, yet the over-the-top antics fall well short of believable (Which certainly doesn't make DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES unique; all films during this era were guilty of offering excessive doses of contrived melodrama.).  Despite such purple-ish production DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES is a powerful and riveting attention-getter.  For a more contemporary, albeit even more somber, portrayal of alcoholism,Leaving Las Vegasis also recommended.D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning",N/A

1345433,"When I came across this version of Romero's classic, I was at once intrigued and skeptical (and I attribute my skepicism to the anniversary edition which included the ""new footage"" including the fire-and-brimstone preacher (as described by one reviewer). But my aforementioned intrigue won, and I ordered this. I guess I was expecting something different, perhaps an ""anime-style"" version. The opening scene in which Barbara and Johnny are sitting in the vehicle talking initially made me say to myself, ""Oh, geez..."" but the pace picked up, somewhat. This isn't really my proverbial cup of tea, but I do give credit for the vision. The live-action sequences were interesting, but the still panels reminded me of the narrated animation version of ""The Watchmen,"" which I found very distracting.Word of advice (and kudos to the production company and the ""Count"" for this suggestion): If you have never seen the original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" do not let this ""reanimated"" version be your first experience. Watch the original first; otherwise, you may be distracted and decide to bypass this classic. May I recommend the Millenium edition?

1234038,"Unlike Bob Dylan, his only rival as the greatest songwriter/poet to emerge in the 1960s, Leonard Cohen is an affable sort, prefacing his songs with remarks to the audience whom he calls ""friends."" While glum Bob acts like he's making a sacrifice by appearing before his fans, Cohen thanks them for ""keeping my songs alive"" and says, ""We're honored to play for you tonight."" He jokes with them in his witty, self-deprecating way. In Leonard Cohen Live in London, taped at the O2 Arena on July 17, 2008, he recalls that he was 60 when he last played London, ""just a kid with a crazy dream.""And the crowd loves him, cheering enthusiastically, and roaring their approval when, in his raspy baritone, he sings those lines from 1988's ""Tower of Song"":""I was born like this, I have no choice,I was born with the gift of a golden voice.""Cohen's voice IS golden, and the songs are magnificent. He performs 24 of them in this concert, all but one from his selective pen. Most of his signature works are here - ""Suzanne,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" ""Take This Waltz,"" ""Hallelujah,"" ""Sisters of Mercy"" (but not, alas, my favorite, ""Joan of Arc"") - songs whose melancholy tone nonetheless have a calm, soothing effect, the perfect antidote to a world that, as Cohen observes, ""is plunged in darkness and chaos."" Hallelujah, indeed!Cohen is also kind to his collaborators, introducing his band and backup singers several times, and highlighting their exceptional work even during the songs (""Dino Soldo on the saxophone,"" he points out midway through ""Bird on the Wire,"" and ""Javier Mas on the archilaud"" before Cohen has even sung a note of ""Who By Fire"").I'll always rank Cohen's October 1988 appearance on PBS's Austin City Limits above any other live performances since it was then that I was formally introduced to this incomparable artist (and when will that glorious hour be released on DVD?), but Leonard Cohen Live in London is outstanding. This is a moment in time to be cherished, now and in the future, when, to paraphrase the man himself, we ache in the places where we used to play. If possible, his voice and music will resonate even stronger then, and heal the most battered heart and soul. I love you, Leonard.Brian W. Fairbanks",N/A

720551,"Five years before she butted heads with James Stewart working at Matuschek and Co. in Ernst Lubitsch's classic pen-pal romance,The Shop Around The Corner, Margaret Sullavan was playing another character living in Budapest, this time a nave young woman chosen to become an usherette in an elaborate movie palace. This warm-hearted 1935 screwball comedy has impressive credentials beyond a luminous Sullavan in only her third film, as it offers a screenplay by Preston Sturges (The Lady Eve) and direction from William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives) who married Sullavan during the tempestuous production. Alas, this was their only collaboration since they divorced less than two years later, but this long-forgotten collaboration is a fruitful one as the then-25-year-old actress sparkles in a role that could have easily been cloying if Wyler didn't maintain the right tempo for Sturges' alternately scatterbrained and clever story.Sullavan plays the improbably named Luisa Ginglebusher, a gregarious, pig-tailed orphan who regales the younger girls with her fanciful fairy tales. A blustery theater owner comes to the orphanage looking for girls to be silver-costumed usherettes at his Budapest movie palace. The head of the orphanage allows Luisa to accept the job on the condition that she performs at least one good deed a day in the real world. At the theater, Luisa meets Detlaff, a waiter who gets her an invitation to an exclusive party at which he is serving. She almost immediately has to hold off the bold advances of Konrad, a somewhat lascivious South American meat-packing millionaire who wants to seduce her and shower her with gifts. However, she isn't interested and lies about being married. When he insists on employing her ""husband"" so he can send him away, Luisa randomly picks a name from the phone book, hoping to do a good deed and divert some of Konrad's wealth to someone else. The lucky man is poor but proud Dr. Max Sporum, but complications obviously ensue when Luisa meets Sporum and Konrad finds out the truth.Although she had few opportunities to play comedy, the adorable Sullavan shines in this type of shenanigan-driven farce, whether using her electric wand to point patrons to their theater seats or prancing with a multiplicity of her mirror images as she models a ""foxine"" stole at the department store. Reginald Owen (Scrooge in the 1938A Christmas Carol) gamely plays Detlaff with rubbery charm, while Frank Morgan (the Wizard inThe Wizard of Oz) is a bit too fey and downright wizardly as Konrad. Generally a tight-lipped presence on the screen, Herbert Marshall (The Little Foxes) has never appeared more animated in a movie than he does as Sporum. Familiar character actors show up like Alan Hale as the cinema impresario, Beulah Bondi as the orphanage matron, a hilariously over-the-top Eric Blore (from all the early Fred-and-Ginger pictures) as a monocled drunk, and a menacing Cesar Romero as a pushy stage-door lothario. An unusual entry on Wyler's resume, this is quite a charmer thanks to Sullavan. The print is clear on the 2002 DVD, which includes the original theatrical trailer and a photo gallery as extras.",N/A

1317816,"""Welcome"" begins with a 17-year-old Kurdish refugee Bilal's attempt to get smuggled into England. He is on the last lap of his long road to reunite his girlfriend Mina now living in London with her family. When Bilal's attempt fails, however, he finds himself stuck in Calais, the closest French town to England across the Channel.The opening part of a French drama ""Welcome"" might remind you of a 2002 film ""In This World"" directed by Michael Winterbottom, but as the story unfolds, you will realize that ""Welcome"" is more about the unlikely friendship between two people than the journey the young protagonist takes. Bilal (Firat Ayverdi), though being a poor swimmer, takes lessons from the local instructor Simon (Vincent Lindon, ""Pour Elle""). It doesn't take much time for Simon to see why Bilal is so eager to learn swimming. Bilal is going to swim across the Channel to meet his love.The film's story is told with a very low key and somber approach. Though dealing with a political subject matter like illegal immigration, the quiet film refrains from shoving a message down your throat. ""Welcome"" is carefully crafted with an eye for detail that makes the two major characters Simon and Bilal vivid and complex.""Welcome"" benefits from compelling performances from the cast, most notably from the stars: newcomer Firat Ayverdi as Bilal, and Vincent Lindon as Simon, whose original motive for helping the Kurdish boy might not be totally altruistic. Simon still loves his estranged wife Marion (Audrey Dana), a schoolteacher who also works as a volunteer helping refugees. Is it that Simon only wanted to impress her?""Welcome"" is an engaging drama that maintains its dramatic tension throughout, greatly helped by the strong acting from the cast and the believable characters you really care.",N/A
1430659,"I only got to see half of this movie one night on TCM.  I had always wanted to see it because I'm an Otto Preminger fan and it's rarely ever shown (but now is being released on DVD).  It's been treated like it's the worst movie ever made by many critics, who savaged it when it came out in 1968.  The meeting of hippies and Otto Preminger was far too much for the critics to take back in those days, I guess.Actually having seen the 2nd half of the film made me realise that the film, while not perfect, is actually pretty creative and crazy.  It's hard to recount the plot, as it's pretty convoluted and kind of inconsequential considering the craziness that's going on in the film.  Some of the schtick in the film feels forced, but overall, I found the 2nd half of the film really funny and charming.  Gleason's ride on a baloon is a wonderful highlight, and the whole cast is pretty game given the circumstances.  It was also rather brave of Preminger to try something as experimental as this at this point in his career.  It doesn't always work, but the film has enough positives to make it worth seeing, even for those who don't care for Preminger.And yes, the final credits are hysterical.  Yes, they are sung by Harry Nilsson, and it is one of the best credit sequences in all of cinema.Otto Preminger's Skiddo can finally be seen, and it deserves to be.",Skidoo

708257,"Because the six-part television series (now on DVD) is of such high quality, I knew that the recently released theatre version would find the series to be a hard act to follow.  I saw the theatre version  26 December, 2011.  My concerns were fully justified.  Everything remarkable and captivating about the series is missing. My advice is to read the book and to see the DVD.  I consider it to be my favourite cold-war spy story, and the quality of the series has much to do with it.To start with, the original book is of high quality.  Then, the television screen play is excellent both from the stand point of plot and with dialogue.  Each character was perfectly cast for physical appearance as well as acting skill.  The audience consequently is able to gain clear insight into the individuals' personalities, characters, roles in MI6, interaction among each other, their strengths and their weaknesses.  The characters come across as real people whom the audience learns to know.  Sir Alec as George Smiley succeeds in communicating more with his tone of voice, pauses, and non-verbal communication than many actors can speaking.  For example when near the end he is asked to ""take charge for a while,""  the potent effect of Smiley's delivery upon the others at the meeting table is so memorable that I can quote those lines.Tinker Taylor is a journey back into a different time, a cold-war time when the old-boys network dominated the intelligence services and time seemed not so rushed as it is in the 21st century.  The series permits sufficient time to allow for long pauses in dialogue during which the characters communicate much through their behavior and visual affect.  This is time well spent that any theatre version would be unlikely to take.  I have watched and shared this DVD series several times with friends, and I never have grown tired of it.",N/A

Her boyfriend is in jail, turns out he is a serial killer. The woman starts going to AA meetings for her alcohol problem. She meets this seemingly nice guy at one of her AA meetings and they start dating. At the start of the movie we get to see the serial killer- the old boyfriend- doing his thing to his victim. I have to say that the guy who played the serial killer wasn't bad, in fact he may have been the highlight of the movie, he did pretty good as far as acting is concerned and overall personality of a serial killer. The rest of the cast didn't impress me. It felt as though some of them were hired right off the street to act in this movie. They didn't capture my interest.If I were to explain to you the whole plot of this movie and give away the ending you would probably say ""wow, that sounds good""- that's the problem- It sounds good but it isn't.So, we find out the boyfriend serial killer has escaped from jail is looking for her and now the old girlfriend needs a place to hide. She goes with this AA meeting guy to a cabin in the woods to hide out and then bam... Twist in the story. The ending sounds good on paper but on the screen it just didn't work for me.

165468,"I've actually watched this movie twice now and enjoyed it the second time as much as I did the first.  This is sort of strange because before the first viewing I came fully prepared not to like this movie.  I had of course heard about it and of course knew something of the subject matter having followed the Flynt odyssey through the press as it unfolded over the years.  To begin with, two of the primary characters being portrayed in this movie, i.e. Larry Flint and Jerry Falwell are right at the top of my list of guys I would be least likely to hang-out with in real life.  To be quite frank, I am not an admirer of either...and that is putting it mildly.Well I was wrong.  This is actually a very good movie with some of the best acting I have seen in quite some time.  Woody Harralson's portrayal of Flint is rather amazing and I feel a good argument could be made that it is Harralson's best so far in his rather strange career.  I am normally not a big fan of Woody's, but I have to tell you that he won me over in this one.  Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife and turns in a performance that will absolutely haunt you.  The chemistry between Harralson and Love simply leaps from the screen.  Both have their part nailed perfectly.Now in many ways this is not an easy film to watch.  Potential viewers should be warned that there are quite a number of rather raw and graphic sex scenes in this one and that there is some rather harsh language.  I suppose this was necessary when you consider the subject matter.  This is not really an objection on my part, only a warning.  Also, many people consider Larry Flint a truly despicable person.  I cannot say that my opinion of him is all that high but I do have to admire him for standing up for all of us and taking his lumps like a man in his battle over free speech.  Rather than focus on my feelings for both Flint and indeed, Falwell, I focused on the movie and found it to be well made, entertaining, in a rather perverse way, and most certainly unforgettable.The acting alone in this one, including all of the supporting cast, is some of the best I have seen in any movie is quite some time.  Each and every player did their part perfectly and realistically.Overall while the subject may be distasteful to some, if you try to be objective, most will find this a very good film.Don BlankenshipThe Ozark",N/A

474327,"Sergio Leone's success caused a flood of Spaghetti Westerns to enter into this country. Many, most were forgettable. This entry isn't bad but it's nothing you haven't seen before.Here's the scoop. A young boy stands by and watches as his father, mother and sister are murdered by some thugs. Their farm house is set on fire and he's pulled out, at the last minute, by someone and avoids death. Fifteen years later he's working on his shooting skills to find those bad guys and do them in. Lee VanCleef is just out of prison after fifteen years and wants to do in his bad guy buddies who double crossed him. Turns out both men are looking for the same men. They form an uneasy alliance.As far as Spaghetti Westerns go this isn't bad. It's directed well enough and things like editing and sound mixing are pro level. The problem is that Leone is a tough act to follow. He had great, colorful characters in his movies. He also knew how to frame a shot. His movies looked great. Here, the two main characters are lackluster. VanCleef is Okay but he seems to be the same character as he was in ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."" John Phillip Law is wooden as the hero. He has nowhere near the charisma Eastwood had. A few of the secondary characters you'd recognize from the Leone films. The story is a simple revenge tale.

1362017,"""The Evil"" is a decent haunted house movie starring one of my favorite actors ever, Richard Crenna.  Crenna is money as usual, and the rest of the case was passable as well.  It could be said that the acting actually saves the movie in a way.  With lesser actors, the movie could have been a disaster.  The story is about a group of doctors who want to set up a drug rehabilitation center in an old and supposedly haunted building.  Strange things start happening early on in the movie, and things get progressively worse in a hurry for the unsuspecting guests.While ""The Evil"" is atmospheric and does a decent job of establishing an overall scary mood, the ""The Evil"" just is not all that it could be.  In short, its execution is severely flawed and lacking in creativity while the movie is also quite short on style.  Haunted house movies are very difficult to pull off because the mood is so difficult to establish, but the hardest part is the manifestations of the horror, and ""The Evil"" fails here as well.  While a reasonably decent haunted house movie especially for the type, ""The Evil"" still has its warts and is definitely an overrated movie given these high reviews.  Recommended for lovers of haunted house movies and ghost stories, but temper those expectations a bit.I have to admit that I have not nees ""Twice Dead"" yet, but I will update the review when I do.",Roger Corman's Cult Classics: The Evil / Twice Dead
1220388,"One of the most depressing, unsettling and bleakest movies I have seen in a long time, 135 minutes long Import/Export 2007, written/directed by Ulrich Seidl is gloomy, dark, and disturbing film. It feels like a documentary, and the winter landscapes in both parts of Europe, Eastern (Ukraine) and Western (Vienna, Austria) look and feel equally un- inviting and mean. Who would think that beautiful out of the fairy tale Vienna could be shot so un-appealing but I guess the nursing places for the ill and old patients are not the most cheerful places anywhere in the world, and they only add to the overall feeling of pessimism, degradation, lack of hope or anything uplifting in the existence of two main characters who never met because their lives moved in the parallel directions, and every character they come across.Ulrich Seidl excels in giving Import/Export feel of a documentary and in showing how advanced the humans are in corrupting and humiliating one another. I think this film takes a prize for the amount of the un- sexy, most unpleasant and longest X-rated scenes ever filmed. I guess if sex is not accompanied with love, desire or at least, lust, it is very boring and uncomfortable to watch and makes a viewer guilty for the degradation they are forced to watch and makes them want to stop or fast-forward these scenes as fast as possible. If that what Ulrich Seidle intentions were - he succeeded fully. Let me put it this way - Import/Export is a well-made move. It made me think of the serious matters - for instance, how high is the price of freedom to look for and to find a better life, to support yourself and your family, to be able to go to any country you chose and to succeed there. I did not see a single false note in any performance given mostly by the non- professionals. Import/Export achieves what it was set to do but I would never watch it again.

340174,"Last night we sat down to watch ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" because it is a classic not shown on any Classic TV station anymore, and it's a Christmas movie that is never shown at Christmas time. It was as great as we remember it was.Bing Crosby is the leading man and parish priest, Father O'Malley assigned to an improverished and delapidated school that is being run by Sister Benedict, played by leading lady, Ingrid Bergman. St. Mary's is a rundown grammar school near and dear to the hearts of the nuns who teach there, especially Sister Mary Benedict. Her prayer for the school's salvation is that a selfish businessman (Harry Travers) will sell the building next door, which she envisions as a school rather than a factory. He envisions a dilapitated St. Mary's as a parking lot for his building. Sister Benedict also has a rather unconvincing clash of wills with Father O'Malley over the development and care of the students, in particular, one failing student from a troubled background named Patsy. Father O'Malley decides to transfer Sister Benedict from the school, but not over the differences, as the good sister thinks.The transfer takes this movie from a delightful fun film with singing interludes by Bing Crosby to emotional, tear-jerk, Oscar-level performances from Bergman and Crosby. Bergman reaches down into her soul to produce emotions that convey disbelief and understanding simultaneously, that convey bitterness and hope. Crosby' face shows the turmoil of telling Sister Benedict the reason for her transfer vs. keeping a dark secret. At this point even the most unemotional soul wlll reach for the Kleenex.Surprisingly neither won the Oscars they were nominated for. (Wow! The winners must have been really good)! This film is much better than what you will find with the remote control in your search for something uplifting.This is one of the things I miss about Christmas.Merry Christmas!",N/A

If anything, it's better now because there's a LOT of stuff that was flying right over our heads, or stuff that we understood, but only on one level, and as it turns out, there are more.The movie is smartly written, well-acted, and although it depicts a New York that in many ways does not exist anymore (pre-Giuliani,pre 9/11,seedy-filthy-Times-Square New York) it still holds up well and isn't ""hopelessly"" dated.The cast is stellar.

418325,"I hope the Blu-ray is good -- the DVD is an inferior transfer.* John Huston's The Bible ... In the Beginning was one of two films photographed in D-150 (the other was Patton), designed to be projected on a deeply curved screen 92 feet wide from a 70mm print. In any home theater I've ever seen it would be impossible to get the hypnotic immersion and suspension of disbelief available in either a D-150 equipped theater or in one of the other 70 mm theaters ... and suspension of disbelief is especially helpful with a film like The Bible.* The older DVD of The Bible was very substandard, but in 70mm the film had a marvelously clear ""walk into it"" quality.  If the Blu-ray is good, sitting much closer to your screen than usual may help get some of the involvement back.  This would be true with most Blu-rays made from 70 mm prints (or 65 mm original color negatives).* At the San Francisco Film Festival John Huston said he regarded the film as ""a poem of a myth, like the Illiad.""  Most reviewers didn't get that.  Religious liberals tended to object to, and were mystified by, the literalist treatment of the subject matter, and some fundamentalists didn't like the (few) liberties taken.* Certain sequences (e.g., The Creation) do constitute a visual poem, and a good one at that.  Huston's portrayal of Noah was utterly charming, as was that whole sequence.* The Noah's Ark sequence was shown during Huston's appearance at the film festival.  Immediately afterward, someone in the audience asked him ""How could the critics so dislike this film?""  Huston answered, ""They really missed the boat on this one.""

946161,"SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING!""The Island"" is one of the better science fiction movies I've seen. It has obvious similarities with ""The Matrix"", ""The Village"" and ""The 6th Day"".The year is 2019. Humanity has been forced underground, due to an environmental disaster that contaminated most of the Earth. The underground society is crowded and authoritarian, with overseers regulating every detail of the citizens' lives. A mysterious place known as The Island is the only place on the surface that hasn't been contaminated. The only way to leave the underground compounds is to win a free ticket to The Island in a special lottery.However, the main character of the movie, Lincoln Six Echo, starts to suspect that something is terribly wrong with this futuristic society. He discovers that the outside world isn't contaminated. He also sees how two of the lottery winners, rather than being taken to The Island, are gruesomely murdered by the overseers! Bizarre cloning experiments take place in a secret part of the underground facility.Lincoln and another inmate, Jordan Two Delta, manage to escape from the underground base. Chased by black helicopters, they pass several ghost towns, but finally make their way to Los Angeles, which turns out to be a thriving, hyper-modern city with no contamination problems whatsoever. More bizarre revelations follow, until Lincoln and Jordan decide to return to the underground facility (really a prison) to free their friends from the clutches of the overseers...""The Island"" got pretty mixed reviews when released in the United States. I agree that the movie lacks the magic that makes ""The Matrix"", ""Blade Runner"" or even ""Star Wars"" so special. Instead, we get a combination of two or three over-worked Hollywood themes: futuristic prison break-out, chase with special effects and cool wheels, and (surprise) a bunch of clones. Still, I'd say ""The Island"" is above average. Somehow, the stereotypes seem to work, and the plot is pretty interesting.For that reason, I give it five stars.

1240707,"**THIS HAS MAJOR SPOILERS (LIKE I CARE!)**HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS - PART 1 (2010) is a great warts-and-all film. How ironic, since it is about witches and wizards. My original review, though almost all here, is scrapped in favor of kicking off complaining about Daniel Radcliffe. He can act, certainly, but in this film he's more than flat. Frustration and angst is the character's hallmark, but the days of a sometimes sweet and charming Harry are days long gone. Be aware of that and beware Radcliffe's unforgivable failures as a young adult actor.This is a very skillful adaptation of novel-to-script, and let no one dispute that fact.The kids (Daniel Radcliffe in spite of it all, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson) are a delight, a true delight! How they've grown, yet they remain themselves.This film's power is mostly in its gloomy silence. Andr&eacute; Desplat's soundtrack, as thin as wispy mountain air, is nonetheless brilliant. Also, Yates handled the disgusting scenes very well. He had to put them in - Rowling wrote it that way, didn't she? I believe Yates split the story - that is, brought Part I to its end - at the perfect moment. I wondered where they'd split it.Now the BAD:The others in this film are a bit on the cardboard site. One expects better, though the acting (such as it is) is great. If you do not blink, otherwise you'll miss it. It angered me that Rufus Scrimegeour (Bill Nighy) was not introduced in the last film as he ought to have been, and here he appears for all of exactly five minutes, including a full minute-plus in the opening scene. This was saved only by the fact that Bill Nighy is as great as ever.What I did love about Scrimegeour was his speech, that opens the film. It was straight from Margaret Thatcher and would have done the old lady proud. I thought it was deeply moving yet hilarious; English audiences will instantly perceive it but I doubt it will have any impact on the American viewer.While I myself cannot tell whether Scrimegeour is talking with a Welsh or Scots accent, it is a precise growl that grabs your attention no matter what. (He says, ""deluminator-r-r-r"" with a velvety purr.) The whole character is reminiscent of the character's name: it is a Scots name and has its own tartan, but it is a sept of a larger clan name. This is the kind of depth you can expect from these great actors, given what little they've got with which to work here.Further, the film sags horribly during its central 40 minutes. Bad, especially after its genius beginning and follow-through. It was intended to do that, but I think it was 40 minutes totally wasted.Oh, now give me a break: Indo-Chinese style shadow puppets to tell the story of the Three Brothers? How unnecessarily cheap Yates can be! They do better than this with crummy historical reenactments in documentaries. And how he skimped on the magic - a fate Roger Ebert tellingly prophesied almost ten years ago.There were disgusting moments that, although I can see as necessary, really should have been re-written for younger viewers. That's just me. Otherwise, there's nothing else. I LOVED this film and wish that the POTTER craze had used a bit more of Yates' tricks in the past. Impossible, but I wish it. Someone said this is ""the most cinematically satisfying"" of all the films. Agreed, but only to a degree.WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SEE AND WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED: Harry and Hermione seeing the ""Potter Memorials"" in Godric's Hollow. A bit more dialogue might have helped.WHAT I REALLY LOVED SEEING (ALMOST AS MUCH AS HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE): Domhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasely. He's a handsome redhead and I wish they'd shown more.PAY ATTENTION: I will only ever explain this once and tough toenails if you think it spoils anything. It is about the wands. Dumbledore of course owns the Elder Wand. Draco disarmed Dumbledore at the tower before Dumbledore died, so the Elder Wand belonged to Draco. Note: one does not need to take the actual wand or fight against it to defeat its master.Therein lies the trick: when Harry disarms Draco of some paltry wands at the Malfoy mansion (shown vividly here), Harry becomes the Elder Wand master. So the fact that Dumbledore is buried with it, and Voldemort steals it, is of no consequence. Harry is still its master as soon as he beats Draco by disarming him.Ending: Voldemort cannot kill Harry with the Elder Wand stolen from Dumbledore's tomb: the wand recognizes its true master. However, he does stun the part of himself that lives in Harry. When Harry awakens, all he has to do then is defend himself and let Voldemort kill himself with his own Avada Kedavra curse. See? Simple.Get this film, no question about that. I hear the Blu-Ray or whatever it's called has terrific extras, which the single, plain-jane DVD does not. The single edition only has deleted scenes, and not nearly as much footage as I expected.DVD COMPLAINING: We were cheated with the plain single DVD for some reason. It has some deleted scenes and there was a lot of smoke and mirrors about what extras would be on the single edition. Remember, this is the arm-twisting that will force us all sooner or later to get Blu-Ray. That angers me more than Warner Brother's habitual broken promises and lies.Yes, there is a double-disc plain DVD edition because we considered it before just getting the single plain one. I'm tired of the almost-100% lame quality of POTTER extras. It's just that there is so much more and apparently the Blu-Ray special is a 3-disc. See? The air is full of rip-offs!We didn't get our single edition at W**~M*** but they did have the double plain DVD edition there ... where was that ...

Ryan P. has filled out a bit since I last saw him in Crash, and he seems perfect for the pretty rich boy role he was cast into. *spoiler at asteriskStill, the plot was the main feature here.

Who was trying to frame the lawyer and what was their personal motive in doing so? Why would Ryan implicate himself in a murder? He didn't appear to be the killing type; it seemed random.

At the risk of repeating other disappointed reviewers, ""Dark of the Moon"" is an utterly lazy, mind-numbingly stupid re-hash of cliches, offensive potty humor, and implausible ""action"" scenes that insult the intelligence even of fans willing to go to great lengths to suspend disbelief for the sake of this movie (a dozen mostly-retired soldiers with 21st century firearms and 6-8 Autobots wipe out hundreds (or thousands...it's not really clear since they position themselves around the whole planet) of Decepticons armed with futuristic lasers??

More pointless blather from Sam's parents; more offensive sterotypes in the form of bit-part Autobots; lots of blurry action that is so close-up you can't even tell what's happening.  It's as if Michael Bay decided since he did a decent job the first time, there was no need wasting good animation on the point of the WHOLE FRANCHISE: robots that ""Transform"" into vehicles!  The first film actually put some effort into depicting these scenes in CG.  In Dark of the Moon, the machines just pop in-and-out of vehicle or robot mode so fast you hardly notice.

The film itself centres on the character played by Tippi Hedren (The Birds). She is a troubled soul who despises the very thought of a man coming near her, let alone touching her. This is unfortunate for big Sean because he falls in love with and marries her! The film explores the concept of such fear and gradually uncovers why the fear (and the sight of the colour red, anywhere) exists.

These were a great start, but the DVD Collection for the TV show never appeared like I hoped it would, until now at least.Right Stuf is releasing the series in 2 13-episode parts (3 discs each). The show itself is a fun 80's action/comedy similar to something like Lupin III - overall a very enjoyable show that should have been released years ago.While the 2-part DVD releases are a bit disappointing with the current trend of releasing single-collection DVD sets, it's much better than what we had even just a few years ago with the individual volume releases for close to the same price as this collection.I am disappointed that it doesn't have a dub - I found the dub on TV to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the show and would gladly have paid a little more for the set if it meant getting a dub produced. With that said, I'm guessing they're not expecting this set to break records in sales so I can see how they might find it hard to justify producing a dub for it. No point deductions here as this is pointed out on the release (although I was a bit surprised to see that, with how almost ever release over the past few years has had a dub).It seems the idea of a dub might have been thrown around - the individual cases in the box list ""English and Japanese Language"" for the audio tracks.For a 25-year-old anime, I thought it looked pretty good. Certainly better than similar titles like Bubblegum Crisis (1987) which had rainbow effects, aliasing and ""marching ants"" at times. The video isn't comparable to modern-day anime, but I wouldn't expect it to be. I'd give it about a 4 out of 5 considering the age. Even on a 50"" TV, upscaled to HD over HDMI, it looks great.Audio is also clear, but isn't going to blow anyone away or win any awards.Subtitles are in yellow and white (alternating when needed to prevent confusion from multiple people talking onscreen).Extras are a bit lacking - while I understand there might not be a collectors-edition worth of extras for a 25 year old anime, this only includes a clean opening credits, trailer for Part 2 and a few other titles. SOMETHING would have been nice, even if it were produced specifically for the DVD release.The box itself is very nice and includes 3 thin-pack DVD cases inside (each with outer artwork).If you liked Bubblegum Crisis, Lupin III or any other Dirty Pair releases (OVA's or movies), this one definitely holds up well next to them and gets my recommendation!","Dirty Pair: The Original TV Series, Pt. 1"

I can easily say that this is my favorite roll by Colin Farrel because he played a really insane vampire. Anton Yelchin also did great in this movie as a freaked out teenager.

1287785,"While there are warm scenes between Darwin and his daughter Anne and also, of course, between Darwin and his wife, the movie as a whole has a somber tenor about it.  The tone of the film is necessarily sad because of the argument being made that the existence of evil argues against God's existence, certainly an age-old argument.  To make the point there is a lot of suffering shown:  by Darwin, his daughter, and by certain creatures that are highlighted.  In making this argument the film-makers do not take into consideration how the fall of man that we read about in Genesis brought death upon all of creation.Darwin as played by Paul Bettany suffers greatly from physical and emotional illness (just as Darwin did) and he is mentally tormented by what he sees as purposeless in nature and the needless destruction of animal life: in the film Darwin mentions the trout, for example, producing myriads of offspring which are then eaten by other animals.There is some historical inaccuracy that I was able to detect.  The major impetus for Darwin writing his seminal book was not so much Huxley, but Darwin's receiving a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace who also conceived the theory of evolution.  Wallace, a spiritist, had received the theory in a vision.  Darwin's colleagues such as Thomas Huxley urged Darwin to write his book so that he would be given sole credit for the theory.  The film makes the reason for the writing of the Origin of Species a moral argument coming from Huxley and agreed upon by Darwin when really it was  the threat from Wallace that was the reason.Christianity is rather misrepresented by the local village pastor who is cruel and unreasonable to Anne and in the end abandons Darwin.  This is an unfortunate representation of Christianity but it helps the argument of the film.  During Darwin's lifetime there were very sincere and Godly Christians who were providing housing, food, and clothing in Bristol and in London.  Thousands of orphans were helped.  This was only a small part of what was happening in Christianity.  It is also true that there were men taking positions as country vicars who cared more for a respectable position and  their hobbies than the souls of men,  but, as I say, there was much more to the picture than what they represented.Also, Darwin's theory was not opposed only by the religious, a point made by Huxley in the movie.  It was also opposed by reputable scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Gregor Mendel to name a few.  Also, many who were religious, including many clergy,  jumped on the Darwinian bandwagon.  Darwin's theory was an excuse to disregard the Bible, or, at the least, not regard it as an authority.  This is the reason why in many religious circles today, the Bible is considered to be only myth or poetry.Many of us can relate, I am sure, to Darwin's struggle (at least to some extent) with the existence of evil and the seeming lack of purpose of things.  For many of us, when we came to know Jesus Christ, we looked at God's creation quite differently and could understand the purpose of things.  We could also appreciate the effect that the fall of man has had upon the creation.  But we can watch this film and realize that before we were Christians we similarly did not appreciate God for who He is and His creation for what it is.",Creation anglais

880737,"I bought Set Five of Midsomer Murders based on a chronology given by a reviewer on Amazon.  If I am going to start a series I like to follow it in chonological order.  I didn't see the series on TV but the reviewer stated that the first episodes were contained in Set Five.  I am 2/5ths of the way through this boxed set and I am baffled by the great reviews that this series has garnered.These two first episodes present some of the nastiest persons that it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. Life is way too short to spend it with people who are so mean-spirited.  First of all, Inspector Barnaby is constantly and unnecessarily sarcastic to his young Sargeant.  There is no reason for this except for unkindness of spirit.  Secondly, in these two episodes everyone sneers at everyone else.  Even if there were no other faults in these episodes who with a healthy mind would want to spend time with these really unpleasant people.  But there are many other things wrong. The killer(s) turn out to be two self-absorbed young people - brother and sister - who have been having an incestuous relationshiop since they were teens and who killed in order to make way for the sister to marry a widower whom they then plan to kill for his money.  There is a hideous mother-and-son blackmailing duo who are grotesque and sickening in their relationship.  But all these nasty people, unpleasant as they are, pale in comparison to those in Episode Two.In Episode Two we have sexual abuse of a young boy by his father, patricide, transvestites and the sort of teenagers that reminded me of Lord of the Flies.  A high school drama club decides to entice their drama teacher to have a sexual relationship with one of the fifteen-year-old girls, photographs him and then, as a group, sends him the photos and tries to blackmail him for money.  When he declines to pay these little monsters post the pictures on the village green so that the whole town can see them.  And, as usual, everyone is sneering at everyone else all of the time.Except for Inspector Barnaby's wife and daughter there doesn't seem to be a single normal human being in these first two episodes and I am really at a loss to understand the fulsome praise that this series has received.  If one wants to see life in an English village I'll take Miss Marple every time.  There are unusual characters to be sure but the overriding miasma of plain mastiness and meanness that I've encountered in Midsomer Murders is entirely absent in the Agatha Christie characters as developed in Miss Marple and in Hercule Poirot.I will watch the next three episodes because I bought them but I am fearful of what horrors next lie in store.

1380905,"""Black Swan"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Nina is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth Macintyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.The cast led by Natalie Portman (in her superb, Oscar-winning performance as Nina), Vincent Cassel (as Thomas Leroy) & Mila Kunis (in a solid performance as Lily) is brilliant!

1453342,"For two decades, most of the famous films of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy have been off the video market, thanks to apathetic handling by the company then holding the rights. Now, finally, the rights have reverted to knowledgeable hands, and that means the boys are back.This 10-disc set includes most of Laurel & Hardy's talkie shorts and features produced by Hal Roach between 1929 and 1940. These are among the funniest comedies ever made, as many vintage-film buffs will agree. Laurel & Hardy were often capable of carrying the action almost entirely by themselves: BRATS has Stan and Ollie as themselves and their own sons (with giant sets and trick photography); THE MUSIC BOX is the Oscar-winning featurette with the boys as the world's worst piano movers; HELPMATES has Stan helping Ollie to clean house after a wild party; THEIR FIRST MISTAKE has our heroes adopting a baby; TOWED IN A HOLE has them rehabbing a boat; BUSY BODIES turns them loose in a carpentry shop. You'll see dozens of examples of how inventive they were with pantomime and dialogue. Their short subjects were so successful that they branched out into full-length features, including their famous hits WAY OUT WEST and SONS OF THE DESERT, the prison comedy PARDON US, the ""gypsy"" comedy THE BOHEMIAN GIRL, the hour-of-sight-gags BLOCK-HEADS and SAPS AT SEA, and several others, including both versions of A CHUMP AT OXFORD (the standard 63-minute print of 1940, and the 42-minute, differently edited ""streamliner"" released in 1943). The supporting casts read like a who's-who of familiar faces: Edgar Kennedy, Billy Gilbert, Charlie Hall, James Finlayson, Mae Busch, Anita Garvin, Walter Long, Harry Bernard, Eddie Dunn, Daphne Pollard, and a host of others. You'll be laughing through 58 L & H comedies.The wonderful news about this set is that the DVDs have been remastered in high definition, from the original surviving 35mm film elements. They are NOT taken from RHI's tape transfers that aired on AMC in the 1990s, or the broadcast masters prepared in 1986 for TV's ""Laurel & Hardy Show"" (some of which are still playing on TCM, and often in shortened form). The DVD producers went back to the source materials, meaning that the vintage Laurel & Hardy comedies have never looked or sounded better on video. The DVD producers have taken some pains with the restoration: picture and sound have been cleaned up digitally; most of the subjects feature the attractive, seldom-seen original titles; and even individual shots cut short in current prints have been restored to their original lengths.In the early days of sound films, before the advent of voice dubbing, some American producers made international versions of their films, with the actors speaking each foreign language phonetically. Laurel & Hardy made several of these multilingual versions, and seven of them are included in this set. These versions offer some surprises, with many of the ""American"" gags extended, and even some entirely new scenes unique to the continental prints.This set differs from the European 21-disc set in that the silent films and the colorized TV editions have been omitted, which cuts the disc space down to a manageable and economical 10 discs. The total running time averages out to a little over three hours per disc, perhaps not the ideal compression rate but about par for the ""double-feature"" DVDs on the market today.The set also includes some two hours of bonus features, of special interest to Laurel & Hardy admirers. THE TREE IN A TEST TUBE is gorgeous, in excellent color, and appears to be a first-generation video copy from the U. S. Government source (except for the main title, the source print appears to be uncirculated). The team makes cameo appearances in ON THE LOOSE, ON THE WRONG TREK, and WILD POSES, and all three shorts are included in their entirety.Print quality on the titles I've seen is superior to any previous video release. For a sample, I went straight to the traditionally battered and bruised titles to check the quality. COME CLEAN, which is usually seen in murky, contrasty prints, is here in much-improved condition, from 35mm with the original main titles. PARDON US, the boys' first feature, is the longer, pre-release preview print, with original main titles and in much better shape than usual (the song ""Lazy Moon"" has none of the patchwork repairs we're used to seeing). THEIR FIRST MISTAKE is seen at last with the full, original title sequence intact. HOG WILD has usually been seen in slightly soft focus; the video version is an improvement. Keep in mind that some of these 58 comedies won't look like they were photographed yesterday because the negatives have been consulted far more often than is customary. Theatrical reissues, TV revivals, and home-movie reprints have caused the 35mm materials to be run through printing machines again and again over the years, with wear and tear showing in the copies. It is a tribute to the DVD producers that they found and used superior archival materials for this set, and many of the ""shopworn"" subjects have been upgraded.Collectors will appreciate many new versions of old favorites. PERFECT DAY is seen in its familiar 1936 form, and (surprise!) in its original 1929 form without the music track. BRATS is also seen with alternate music tracks (but curiously, the ""1930"" version has vintage-1937 reissue titles, even though the original titles are known to exist). PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES is the longer, original-release print; it includes some unpleasant domestic-abuse scenes that were removed for reissue, but it also includes a longer version of the ""Three Bears"" bedtime-story sequence.Bottom line: this long-awaited release is the best boxed set of comedies offered in years. Ideal for family viewing, and these timeless classics can be enjoyed over and over again. Laurel & Hardy are true masters, and you won't be disappointed.UPDATE: Here's a list of the actual content, as reported by Lou Lumenick for the New York Post:DISC 1:UNACCUSTOMED AS WE ARE 1929BERTH MARKS 1929MEN O' WAR 1929PERFECT DAY 1929 [original 1929 track]PERFECT DAY 1936 [reissue with musical score]THEY GO BOOM 1929THE HOOSE-GOW 1929NIGHT OWLS 1930LADRONES (Night Owls, Spanish) 1930BLOTTO 1930DISC 2:LA VIDA NOCTURNA (Blotto, Spanish) 1930BRATS 1937 [reissue, new LeRoy Shield musical score]BRATS 1930 [original score of stock jazz-band records]BELOW ZERO 1930TIEMBLA Y TITUBEA (Below Zero, Spanish) 1930HOG WILD 1930THE LAUREL-HARDY MURDER CASE 1930NOCHE DE DUENDES (The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case & Berth Marks, Spanish) 1930ANOTHER FINE MESS 1930DISC 3:BE BIG! 1931CHICKENS COME HOME 1931POLITIQUERIAS (Chickens Come Home, Spanish) 1931LAUGHING GRAVY 1931LES CAROTTIERS (Feature: Be Big! & Laughing Gravy, French) 1931DISC 4:LOS CALAVERAS (Feature: Be Big! & Laughing Gravy, Spanish) 1931OUR WIFE 1931PARDON US (Feature, extended version) 1931COME CLEAN 1931ONE GOOD TURN 1931BEAU HUNKS 1931DISC 5:HELPMATES 1932ANY OLD PORT 1932THE MUSIC BOX 1932THE CHIMP 1932COUNTY HOSPITAL 1932SCRAM! 1932PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES (Feature) 1932THEIR FIRST MISTAKE 1932DISC 6:TOWED IN A HOLE 1933TWICE TWO 1933ME AND MY PAL 1933THE MIDNIGHT PATROL 1933BUSY BODIES 1933DIRTY WORK 1933SONS OF THE DESERT (Feature) 1933OLIVER THE EIGHTH 1934GOING BYE-BYE! 1934DISC 7:THEM THAR HILLS 1934THE LIVE GHOST 1934TIT FOR TAT 1935THE FIXER UPPERS 1935THICKER THAN WATER 1935THE BOHEMIAN GIRL (Feature) 1936DISC 8:OUR RELATIONS (Feature) 1936WAY OUT WEST (Feature) 1937SWISS MISS (Feature) 1938DISC 9:BLOCK-HEADS (Feature) 1938A CHUMP AT OXFORD (42 min.) 1940A CHUMP AT OXFORD (Feature, 63 min.) 1940SAPS AT SEA (Feature) 1940DISC 10:SPECIAL FEATURESA Tribute to Laurel & HardyOn Location with the Boys: tour of set locations and interactive mapLaurel & Hardy Guest AppearancesLaurel & Hardy Trailers",Laurel & Hardy:  The Essential Collection
1293952,"In the first installment of the ""Millenium trilogy"", the paths of goth hacker Lisbeth and whistle-blower journalist Mikael crossed, leading the two to solve an intriguing 40-year old mystery involving a toxic aristocratic family. In the second installment, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"", the focus is almost entirely on the monsters that make up Lisbeth's tragic past, and how they all seem to come together to create the central storyline. Lisbeth's past seems to be made up of a trilogy of monsters; all older men who used their positions of authority in order to abuse, violate, or silence her.After going abroad for 18 months, Lisbeth is back in town to deal with the first of her trilogy of monsters, the Guardian who brutally raped her in the first film. Her Guardian has apparently hired someone to steal back the videotape Lisbeth made of the rape that she's been using to blackmail him into leaving her alone. Lisbeth confronts her Guardian using his own gun, which unfortunately later ends up being used in three murders, leaving Lisbeth the prime suspect and a wanted woman. Mikael becomes enmeshed in the story when a young reporter working for his paper, researching an article on the illegal sex trade industry, is murdered, and Lisbeth becomes the suspect. Mikael knows Lisbeth enough to know she's innocent, and works to not only try to clear Lisbeth's name but avenge the death of the young, idealistic reporter.Two of the other trilogy of monsters from Lisbeth's past play central roles in the film as well; the second being the psychiatrist who abused her while she was illegally institutionalized as a child, and third, and most importantly, Lisbeth's father. Shown only in a brief flashback in the first film, when Lisbeth set him on fire at the age of 12, her father is apparently still alive, still horribly scarred physically by what Lisbeth did, and planning on killing her.Much of the film has Lisbeth on the lamb, both hiding from the police and from her father's thugs, as well as trying to find evidence to clear her name. Lisbeth, the character, is most compelling when she's in full-on fighting bad-ass mode, and this film probably has the most action of any of the trilogy, especially featuring Lisbeth. As in the first film, Lisbeth is an incredibly compelling character (playing by a compelling actress); magnetic, charismatic, vulnerable and yet indomitable.The film ends with plenty of loose ends, and once again, I find myself immediately wanting more.

For Colored Girls is not a popcorn movie that u would watch with a date or family.  I think it's more designed for intellectual types, artists or film lovers.  The performances are what really carry this movie.  My favourite character was Lorretta Devine's character.  Janet Jackson also gave her best acting performance in her career.

1428044,"After all the rumors and promises throughout the years, Shout! Factory is giving the US Transformers fans what the others have never come through on. Glad to see this series is finally getting its long over do region 1 release. I have seen some of the episodes on Youtube and it seems to be a very cool continuation of where the series in the US ended (for whatever reason, rather it was just the declining poularity at the time or the rumors that these episodes were shipped from Japan to be aired in the US but would end up being destroyed in some type of fire. Either way it was ended with the Rebirth (Season 4) series).Without spoiling too much I thought the concept was just as cool as having the Humannoids as the head and as guns in Rebirth. The only difference is that the these robots are ones who left Cybertron during the Great War to live in peace. While on the planet they picked for their home they designed bigger robot bodies and then they became the heads of those bigger bodies. You will see a lot of new characters as well as some of the older characters from the first three seasons of The Transformers. Like Transformers: The Movie, this series is another transition from earlier characters to the focussing on the newest characters which were the newest toyline at the time.All in all I have liked what I have seen of the series so far on sites like Youtube and can't wait to get this and see the entire series. With this release and the re-release of Beast Wars I hope Shout! Factory sticks with it and we get a region 1 release of the remaining Japanese series (Masterforce and Vitory for G1, Beast Wars Second and Beast Wars Neo for Beast Wars) as well as the one shot episode for Transfomers: Zone.I recieved the DVD this week. Shipping was prompt, the only knock I give it is that it was not packaged too great. It was loosely put in an oversized envelope and look like it had been moving around in shipment. It seems Amazon is a little hit or miss anymore with their packing of the items for shipment. Other than that the set was fine, none of the plastic inside or out was broken, no loose DVDs inside and no scratches or anything on the DVDs.As for the episodes, this is a lot better than finding and watching these on Youtube. The episodes were good to watch and the dialogue seems like it has a little more humor in some spots espcially when watching the antics of Daniel and Wheelie.

I liked Eli (although not as much as Abby) in the Swedish version but Oskar, with his nose running all the time, I could not stand.I thought Eli's eyes were great.  I liked the scene with the crane taking the body ice cube out of the frozen lake.  I liked the acid burns better.

1412731,"A very delicate subject is given a sweet, sensitive treatment in a beautiful film from Brazil, ""From Beginning to End"" written and directed by  Aluisio Abranches.  Francisco and Tomas  are half-brothers who have always been very close--too close, some say--as boys.  When they reach adulthood their closeness blossoms into a sexual relationship following the death of their mother.  This incestuous relationship is treated with restraint and compassion, never sensationalized.  In fact, so touching is their relationship that the viewer soon forgets the nature of that relationship.Everything about this film is first-rate.  The performances by Joao Gabriel Vasconcellos and Rafael Cardosa as the adult brothers and Lucas Cotrim and Gabriel Kaufmann as the brothers as children are outstanding.  The rest of the cast is fine as well. The cinematography is gorgeous.  The score is evocative.  The writing is intelligent the direction is crisp.The sex scenes are erotic and yet very tender.Like many foreign films, the story unfolds slowly, too slowly for some (but not for me.)  But the pace allows the audience to get to know the brothers better and appreciate their feelings for one another more fully.The story might take some getting used to, but ignore the controversial subject and view it as a tender story of two very attractive men in love.",From Beginning To End

The chemistry between Jake and Anne is very realistic and believable.- Love scenes. Wow, I wasn't expecting this much, but there is a a lot of sex scenes and nudity. I mean, A LOT.- Parkinson's theme representation was decent. The movie explored the disease just enough to not bore me.Overall, entertaining romance flick.",N/A
1365807,"... for the great mythic American Western! How could anyone who saw ""Shane"" first run like me, or ""Liberty Valance"" or the spaghetti westerns of Clint Eastwood, or John Wayne at his surliest NOT relish this warm-hearted resurrection of the classic gunfighter western?!?Great cinematography was part of that classicism; the first time I visited the Grand Tetons, I knew every vista intimately from having watched ""Shane"" half a dozen times. The Coen Brothers give us that sense of landscape which is the emotional core of the Western as a genre.Bridges, Brolin, and Damon ham up their roles relentlessly, but that too was part of the classic western genre, which included such hamsters as Roy Rogers, the Cisco Kid, and Gene Autry. Only later did the western go through a 'noir' bloodbath-and-nastiness phase. The Coen brothers have synthesized the Saturday matinee westerns of the 40s and 50s with the faux-realism of the later westerns.And the girl Mattie Ross, played by Hailie Steinfeld, was miraculous!

Gozilla is an independent company and the claim of ""digital remastered"" did have me doubting.  When the package arrived I was in for a good surprise. The packaging is well done and the 8 discs are well secured in the single case. The image quality was a lot better than expected. It is true that it is not 1080HD but Gozilla made a very good effort in enhancing and improving the original prints on each episode.While some artifacts remain the image itself is very clean, sharper and the colors are bright and balanced.Occasionally the sound levels drop but not a big deal.  I recommend this to anyone since there are only a couple box sets available and I do not think the full collection will ever be officially released by any major studios.Note: On each episode the Gozilla logo flashes in and out in the lower corner, not a major issue but wish it was left off of the actual episodes.

1426542,"Zoe Jakes is a charming and graceful instructor, whose dvd is a well-planned thing, which could have been better executed. She is VERY verbal, talking non-stop, and painstakingly showing correct positions while slowly going through the drills. She makes a few errors as she speaks, but instead of doing another take, she corrects herself, occasionally laughing at her own flub. This might get annoying with repeated viewings. The group drills definitely flow better than the individual instruction section, with no stopping to explain technique, but the viewer is confused by the strange angles. Zoe faces her students and everyone is filmed at a sort of sideways angle to the camera. Speaking of camera, at times the cameraman focuses on Zoe's upper body during a drill (and also, unforgivably, during Zoe's performance.) It might take me several viewings to figure out some of these drill sequences. This is not a dvd for beginners, but for more intermediate students of tribal style belly dance. In summary, I like this dvd, but I wish there could be some kind of training manual for people who film instructional dance dvds. Rule #1: We need to see the instructor's entire body!",N/A

1234296,"If you are squeamish about your movies, if you can't handle violence or sexual content or dark psychological trauma, do not view ANTICHRIST.  Just don't.  Turn away and don't look back.  Because this is not an easy film to watch.  I say this as someone who is seldom disturbed by fiction; it isn't real, it doesn't get to me.  ANTICHRIST does.  I can't say that I will ever watch it again...and yet the viewing experience will last for quite some time.The film's plot is deceptively simple.  A couple (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg) suffer the loss of their infant son.  The tragic event throws the wife into grief, and her therapist husband suggests a trip to the woods to help her overcome her grief.  As you may expect, things don't go quite according to plan.For two actors to hold a film on their shoulders requires an immense level of talent.  Dafoe and Gainsbourg both turn in performances that are stellar; the only reason these actors haven't received infinite accolades is because the film itself is so controversial...the controversy in large part due to the realism of the performances.  This is a highly surrealistic film, yet the pair manages to grasp a level of reality and cling desperately to it.  The result is graphic violence--often sexual in nature; consider yourself warned--that hits harder and surer than the ""torture porn"" films that are being tossed about these days.  This isn't the latest SAW sequel.  This is Lars von Trier ripping at your guts, going below the belt and doing considerable damage.  It's a film full of art-house imagery, macabre scenarios (von Trier has been studying his Lynch), and thoroughly disturbing concepts.  Slightly misogynistic in nature (but intentionally so, without judgment) though it may be, ANTICHRIST is a film that will leave a lasting impact.  You can love it or hate it; there's no middle ground.  Either way, you have to admit, this film succeeds at its intended purpose--that is, it gets a reaction from you, a visceral response that leaves little room for doubt.",Antichrist
1389737,"I'm a big fan of horror.  HOWEVER, the zombie genre is waaaaaay down on the bottom of my 'to watch' list.  I've seen them, but personally I don't like them very much, never really have.  Maybe it's because at one time these were human beings.  Heck, even the young aren't spared the possibiltiy of being turned into a rotling.  And, it's never just one zomboid comin' after your arse, but a bagillion at once. The walking dead have always just creeped me out!With that being said my son MADE me watch the first episode.  I was sooooo agitated, uneasy, and hyper darn near yelling at the TV to ""SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT, DON'T GO IN THERE, RUN YOU SOB, RUN!!, DON'T GO DOWN IN THAT PITCH BLACK STAIRWELL, DON'T DO THAT, GO GO GO!!!  (alas, the TV nor the actors ever listen!).  Yet, by the end of the first episode and how it ended, I felt strangely compelled to watch another episode. YEAH.... let's set myself up for more MAJOR squik factors, agitation, and nightmares which are sure to follow!Needless to say, I'm hooked!!  I love this show!  It's so much more than just the rotlings looking for their next snackie. Plus you find yourself saying, ""Oh hell no..... a person wouldn't do this or that"", thereby putting yourself in the situation of how you'd handle yourself in a Zombie Apocalypse.This show definately elicits strong emotional repsonses from the viewing audience, as this core group of survivors do some bone head things.  I think that's why I get agitated & aggrevated, because in a real life survival situation, you wouldn't DO some of the DUMB THINGS they do. No way in hell I'd be going out into the forest to pick mushrooms alone....ALONE!!!! ""Off I trapse, tra la, tra la....."" I'd have more friggin' armed sentry around me than the Queen of England protectin' my butt!!. I'd also be raiding places for silencers, heck, even poor man silencers would do, (noise attracts the rotlings, among other things).  But then if our group of survivors didn't do all these stupid things, we wouldn't have a show, now would we?  I would soooo want Daryl on my side when things go in the pooper!...  Go Team Daryl! He rocks!!  Glen also has a good head on this shoulders.There are excellent character dynamics going on.  You come to care about these folks in their quest for survival.  Some of their behavior will shock and surprise.  But that's what makes this show awesome, you're never really sure what's happening next. The special effects are quite good too. The first season was only 6 episodes long.  A&E; wanted to see how well this show would be received.  Apparently it's been overwhelmingly positive.  Season 2 is following suit, though a little bit slower paced. They didn't have to cram so much into just six episodes, and the mid-season finale for season 2 was a corker!!Even those who get squiked and are squimish about rotlings and all things dead should give this series a try.

1369692,"Another review suggest this movie is actually a TV show or mini-series that has been spliced together for release into a 95 minute movie, and that makes a lot of sense to me after watching this. Kung-Fu Master is no piece of art, as a movie or as a genre entry. Dou Xiao's direction is incredibly poor, and the martial arts are a curious mix of actual skill, badly done (and silly) wire-fu, and cut-aways evincing incredibly bad editing. While a plot can be thin in this genre, it should at least be serviceable. This movie has no discernible plot, and the end makes zero sense.What's good about it? Well, Kung-Fu Master has some excellent long shots of some of the fights that incorporate several combatants at once. Most of these sequences involve fights with javelins or sticks. There's also (I think?) good effort displayed by star Yuen Biao, but the wire-fu and endless cuts always make you question whether it's real or completely faked.It almost seems as though the movie is trying to be a modern day version of one of those cheesy chop-socky movies from the 70s, but I can't quite believe the people behind Kung-Fu Master had that much vision. I got the movie dirt cheap at a close-out sale for a Blockbuster Video store. And that's about all I can recommend you expend for it. Poor.",N/A

Though not particularly well-directed, Fleischer does nothing to screw up the material, and ""Soylent Green"" is effective, especially the last 20 minutes.""Soylent Green"" fairly intelligently addresses issues that have become even more important since it was made -- overpopulation, and the loss of resources. The screenplay conflates the multiple stories in Harry Harrison's novel (which wouldn't work well as a movie) into the events surrounding the brutal murder of a Soylent executive (not in the novel), and Thorn's (Heston's) investigation. The surprise ending (also not in the novel) is the logical outgrowth of how a profit-making corporation would handle the need to feed an ever-growing population. Jonathan Swift would have laughed his ass off.""Soylent Green"" is worth seeing just for Edward G Robinson's last performance. (He was never even /nominated/ for Best Actor.) Charlton Heston is his usual stiff, stilted self (it's impossible to understand how such an intelligent, self-aware person could have been such a poor actor), except for a few scenes with Robinson. Their shared meal of food stolen from the victim's apartment is charming, and Heston seems genuinely upset at Robinson's death. (Heston was the only person Robinson told he was dying, hoping it would influence his performance. It did.)Star Trek fans will note that the head of the Exchange is Celia Lovsky, T'pau of ""Amok Time"". Her famous line, ""De air is de air"", gains resonance in a film about environmental pollution.The musical score is unusual. Almost all the music is brief source music (eg, a radio playing). So when Beethoven and Grieg are played during Robinson's death, they have an impact they would not otherwise have.WARNING: If you're elderly, and not much in love with life, Robinson's death might send you to the kitchen in search of a large, sharp bread knife.The Blu-ray edition is better than any version I've seen.

Despite obvious Production Code restrictions, director Anthony Mann has crafted an unusual genre-bending film - marred by a painfully weak finale and the miscasting of Wendell Corey (who, unlike Gilbert Roland, displays zero  chemistry with Stanwyck).  Victor Milner's Oscar-nominated cinematography is complemented by a classic Franz Waxman score.

1381189,"Saw this on the airplane.While the premise of a teacher who hates her students is definitely serviceable, I was annoyed by two things:1.  In the movie, the teacher's supposedly brutal sense of humor was too soft.  She really should have been much crueler.  I think this is because the film was going for the wrong sense of humor.  It was going for the shock-joke nature of comedy, while it should have been aiming at a sardonic, ironic kind of humor.  I kept waiting for her to unload some nasty, soul-crushing comments on the students or other faculty, but instead she was just a paper tiger.2.  While her character was well-sketched, she underwent a complete, unprovoked reversal at the very end that betrayed everything that had gone before.  Quite apart from the fact that that ending could be seen coming from a mile way, the movie hadn't ""earned"" it.  It felt abrupt, felt like they had just done it because her renouncing her big goal abruptly at the end of the movie and starting to love teaching was what was expected by the audience.  But the movie would have been tons more effective and memorable if she stuck it out through the end, got her plastic surgery, and then given everyone the finger at the end of the movie.  It would have been much truer to her character and the nature of the film in general.In other words, ruined by a Hollywood ending.",N/A

1060647,"The only quibble that I have with the remarkable third season of HBO's revisionist western is that the series was not picked up for a fourth season which left the rich saga of the corrupt mining town without a sense of closure.  Perhaps someday fans will be rewarded with a resolution to the series, but until that time arrives Deadwood's three season run will rank among the finest television accomplishments of the past decade and of all time.Season three is an improvement over the strong but somewhat unfocused second season which seemed to suffer from the lack of a dominant storyline to keep things moving at a swift pace.  Instead of offering numerous plot threads that didn't quite seem to completely come together, the 12 episodes of this final season are tied together by a power struggle between Al Swearingen,, the camp's power hungry saloon owner, and George Hearst (Gerald McRaney) a ruthless captain of industry who cares only about what resources he can extract from the town using whatever means necessary.  As Hearst, McRaney is a force to be reckoned with.  He gives an amazing performance effortlessly portraying Hearst as a barely controlled volcano of rage capable of erupting at anytime with the slightest provocation.  It takes quite an actor to overshadow McShane's heart of darkness, but McRaney is up to the task.  The tension that he brings to every scene ratchets up the drama and suspense of season three and his presence even lingers in scenes that he is not in.While Hearst dominates the proceedings, the other plotlines take on a stronger sense of relevance and gravity.  Seth Bullock runs for sheriff, his partner runs for mayor, Joni Stubbs and Calamity Jane work towards happier existences, Trixie is torn between her feelings for Sol and her loyalty to Al, Ellsworth and Alma struggle to keep their marriage together and Alma continues to suppress her feelings for Bullock.  All the while the dialogue is as poetic and pungent as ever and acts of violence erupt at the drop of a hat.  It all makes for an exceptional third season and even though things are left unresolved, there is a certain poignancy in the season finale when Al bemoans the desire of one of his underlings to be ""told something pretty"".  Life in Deadwood is extremely difficult and only those who can accept that will make it out alive.  Season three, for now, will leave us wondering just who those lucky few would have been.",Deadwood: Season 3

1350087,"When ""Modern Family"" premiered in the fall of 2009, it was a breath of fresh air. An incredibly brilliant, well written and acted series depicting family life of the Pritchett/Dunphy clan. It was one of the best things I had seen on network TV in years. From start to finish, the debut season was an instant classic, and the show deservedly got the attention from critics and award shows. But then came the obvious question. Can they do it again? Was the show a one season wonder? Would they suffer from the ever dreadful 'sophomore slump'? When season two premiered in the fall of 2010, it was apparent right away, especially with the first few episodes, that any fears or doubt were instantly washed away. Season 2 premiered as strong as ever, and rolled out 24 high quality episodes. But first....A little catch up. The series features Pritchett family patriarch, Jay (the fantastic Ed'o'Neill), who is married to a much younger columbian woman named Gloria (Sofia Vergara), and step-father to Manny. His daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) is married to Phil (Ty Burrell), and they have three children, Haley, Luke, and Alex. Jay's son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) lives with his partner, Cameron (the hilarious Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted daughter, Lily.Season 2 got things off on the right foot. The season premiere, ""The Old Wagon"", was a strong welcome back that showcased everything that makes the show so great. Humor and heart. The episode dealt with Phil finally deciding to get rid of the old family car, but not without one last trip down memory lane. One of the season's best episodes for sure. Next up is ""The Kiss"". The show had had some controvery surrounding the gay characters of Mitchell and Cameron never kissing. This hilarious episode focuses on Mitchell's growing concern of Cameron's reluctance to show passion in public. It was such a well done episode that made the ballyhoo surrounding it into nothing, as the episode handled it in such a normal, natural way, and didn't make a big deal out of it. Brilliant! Episode 3, ""Earthquake"", was supposed to be the season premiere, but was pushed back to be the 3rd episode. It doesn't take much to figure out what the episode is about. ""Unplugged"" is a great episode that features Phil and Claire persuading the kids to all give up their electronical devices and learn to communicate better with each other. ""Halloween"" is another instant classic. Claire goes all out for the holiday and has everyone playing a part, but of course, it doesn't go too well. Elsewhere, ""Caught In The Act"" is an unflinchingly funny and honest episode where the 3 Dunphy kids catch their parents 'in the act '. Valentine's Day laughs return in the hilarious ""Bixby's Back"", and Nathan Lane shines as a Mitchell/Cam buddy who befriends Jay in ""Boys' Night"". ""See You Next Fall"" deals with Alex's middle school graduation, and the hilarity that ensues trying to get there. The season ends with Jay's birthday and him just wanting to go fishing, but his family has other plans in ""The One That Got Away"". There's so much more!Some say season 2 DID in fact suffer from a sophomore slump, but I just don't see it. The second half of the season isn't as strong as the first, but that doesn't mean anything. It's still great. The overall season is yet another testament to the great writing, acting, and directing that was established in season one. Each character is still fully fleshed out and with their own unique personalities. The incredibly talented cast continue to make their charcaters full fledged, fully fleshed out characters we love, care about, and laugh with. It doesn't hurt that the writing is so sharp, so clever, so relatable, and the humor as top notch as ever, for the actors to once again display why they are the best ensemble cast on television. I love how the show never shys away from the sweet moments, how almost every episode ends with something nice. That's just not something you get a lot of on television these days. It's the show that not only makes me laugh, but can also move me and make me feel for these people. I can't remember the last time I said that about a network television show.The season 2 set also comes pretty well packed with special features. Just like the season 1 set, it comes with Deleted Family Interviews, Deleted And Extended Scenes, and a Gag Reel.

1494856,"""Midnight is Paris"" was the perfect title for a story that narrates a universal struggle of spouses stuck in irreconcilable differences. The fiance was overwhelmed with his partner's detachment and uncaring behavior. The fiancee's inability to separate from her previous romantic attachment caused her to take her present fiance for granted and to approach him as a failing and unworthy lover. As in many failing relationships, the in-laws united with their daughter in pushing her to the edge where her male partner was cornered with three hateful family members.The major cause of success in the movie was the docile and decent conduct of the fiance who portrayed a helpless victim of spousal abuse in face of pushy and demanding fiancee. His only escape from his tormentors was traveling back in time through the early decades of the twentieth century in Paris. Those day-, or for that purpose, night-dreams lent him greater support in bailing out of a pending disastrous marriage.Through the real world, of a daughter and her family cooperating in messing up a new blossoming relationship where the daughter obsessed of fitting her new fiancee into her past broken romance, and the fictional world of esacping into the past and living the great era of art and literature of France during the twentieth century, the movie painted the complex struggle of a writer dreaming to reconcile his fictional imagination with a materialistic and fast lifestyle of ordinary people.The fictional night-dream was a true paradise for an aspiring writer where many great theories, plays, characters, and acts could come to live and assure the struggling victim with his true worthiness in the universe.  The real daily world with filled with sun light that made characters and objects appear fake and artificial. Both the victim and the viewers were relieved by the courage of the fiance to end a hellish relationship despite the sad end of his fictional day-dreams that crashed in another broken romance.",N/A

A battle of wills ensues with Luke versus all comers: prisoners, camp guards, tracking dogs, visiting family, God and finally the camp captain played by Strother Martin. While scenes of the egg contest and the girl washing a car are now movie icon, it's the less lauded scenes for me that grab you and keep you.

1379995,"If you love music and life you don't want to miss this performance!Along with countless others I too have been an enthusiastic fan of this great work; I have had the opportunity to see it on stage and have owned the LaserDisc version of the 10th Anniversary Concert for many years. The power, beauty and drama of this work never fails to profoundly move me when I watch it and the melodies haunt me for days afterward.When I saw the 25th Anniversary Concert was available on Blu-ray I ordered it immediately; my first thought was how it would compare with the 10th Anniversary Concert that I had watched so many times on LaserDisc. I almost thought of myself as a judge who would sit in judgment and pronounce sentence.I wasn't very far at all into the performance before I lost that mindset; I was swept up by the beauty, power, and emotion of this performance. Yes it is different from the 10th Anniversary Concert but suddenly that was of absolutely no importance as I felt I was witnessing a glorious, emotional performance of fabulous music.To get the technical considerations out of the way; the video and audio are all you would expect from a contemporary Blu-ray recording. The picture is clear and crisp and the surround sound is a delight to the ears. The only real disappointment with this disc is the absence of any liner notes; no commentary, pictures, nothing. It doesn't really seem like too much to ask that something be added that gives information on the cast and performance.The performance itself left me feeling that I had received my money's worth and more; I noticed at the end of the disc, after the concert that people in the audience seemed to be milling about, not really ready to bring the evening to a close. I felt the same way as if a wonderful experience was over before I was really ready for it to end.The closing credits mentioned something I was unaware of, a movie version was in the works. Well hooray, finally a movie version of the entire musical! I had off and on been checking to see if a movie version with full staging and action was available but had always been disappointed to see that it had not.It appears that during an interview in Spain, last September, a journalist asked Cameron Mackintosh why a movie version of Les Miserable's had not been made. It is reported that he said a contract for a movie had been signed and he said in part,""We'll be working with a screenplay writer over the next few months and hopefully if all that comes together, we will find a great director and start."" That is really good news to those of us who have loved the concert versions.I'll not make an attempt at evaluating all of the individual performances but will say that Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean brings a truly memorable voice to the part. The other roles are handled with emotion, power, and conviction; I found I had tears rolling down my cheeks at several points during the performance. Two tidbits of casting trivia, Lea Salonga, who sings the role of Fantine in this production sang the role of Eponine in the 10th Anniversary Concert; Jenny Galloway performs as Mme Thenardier in both performances.If you enjoy great music, well performed, you really owe it to yourself to buy this disc; if you don't have Blu-ray then get the DVD, just don't fail yourself by not buying it!",N/A
403962,"I first watched The Truth About Cats and Dogs, many years ago when it was first released on VHS. It remains one of the movies that, whenever I'm running through my library of films and my finger comes across it, I have to take it out and watch again. As some of the other reviews have mentioned, it's rather simple in its telling and the outcome is obvious from the onset. However, it's a story so full of ""moments"" that it's wonderful to watch over-and-over.Oddly, I've never been an Uma Thurman fan. This movie is the exception and possibly because it makes fun of the very attributes normally touted for her roles. Quite the opposite is true about Janeane Garofalo... I've always enjoyed her acting (more so than her comedy--go figure) and have been disappointed that there weren't more films with her in a central role. So ""Truth..."" gives me a good dose of Janeane, and Uma in a form that I can enjoy. As for Ben Chaplin, he was delightful and charming, and it was nice to see a male lead who was attracted to a woman for something other than her physical attributes.As for my favorite scene (just one of the story's ""moments""), it would have to be Janeane's and Ben's walk along the beach which ended with them watching the sunset as the air turned cool. After offering her his coat and holding her to help her stay warm, you could feel the chemistry between the two, even before the truth of the situation had come out. It's a shame that films like this are so often dismissed as trivial and unimportant, when in fact, if the characters are believable and the tale is warm and kind, and unfolds in a way that's fitting for the circumstance, it's a good movie.If you like romantic comedies or films that are full of warmth and feeling (with some humor thrown in for good measure), I'd recommend this one.",The Truth About Cats & Dogs VHS
1296640,"I had read reviews and thought about buying this DVD for ages.  So glad I finally bought it!  Petra is a great coach and the workout is a lot of fun while still being serious.  She does combos of workout sequences, starting out with a basic routine, then giving it a dance twist, and then doing an intense minute at the end.  Each of these sequences ends with a one minute relaxation stretch before the next sequence begins.  The entire workout is about 60 minutes, but there are 3 ""express"" segments which are a little under 20 minutes each.  You can do one or two of these if you don't have time for the full workout.  I really like Petra's personality--she gives solid cues and is energetic and fun without being annoying or chirpy. Highly recommended!",N/A

174524,Some people have said this movie is scary including my mom who really wanted to see it. If thats how you think so be it but dont stop other people from seeing it. Im a big fan of Christmas movies and have never found it scary. I just wish Id known it was a Christmas movie when it was in the theater although in hindsight which is twenty twenty the word polar should have been a clue. What these people call scary I call thrilling and entertaining.To each his own I guess unfortunally. A little kid is unsure of the existance of Santa Claus so a train takes him to the north pole on Christmas eve. Thats all it is. The fact that it had a little action in it is just coincidental.That was probably done to keep viewers interested and all of you people who said it was to scary have obviously either missed the point of the movie or not bothered to watch it long enough.

1107985,"It's difficult to make a movie about childhood and the teen years. When we're young, the world is a small and emotionally charged place in which mad things are taken for normal. It's a world of miniatures that seem huge and it's a claustrophobic place. All this is difficult to capture in a movie. Yet this movie succeeds brilliantly through a combination of outstanding camera work and deft direction and editing.Blanche Baker is superb as the small-scale Eichmann who vents her bitterness and frustration on the two girls in her care. She hits just the right note: neither underplaying nor overplaying her role. The ""look-the-other-way"" tendency of humanity was particularly in evidence in 50s American suburbia and that's also captured here with great subtlety yet force, in a way that reinforces the quiet insanity of ""Aunt Ruth"". Everything conspires to enable the abuser and disempower the abused.It's easy to understand why many people have difficulty in watching this movie. Unlike most of the schlock churned out by Hollywood, this has real emotional impact and it is about real-world events. The scene in which Aunt Ruth sadistically beats the helpless crippled child for whom she's supposed to be caring is authentically gut-wrenching in a way that no amount of fake-blood-Rambo-violence-stock-movie-effect can ever hope to approach. Everything here is with the volume turned down. It's the evil of banality, the evil of small but insidious things.One reviewer wrote that maybe some things shouldn't be the subject of movies but I disagree. If we don't acknowledge the evil we're all capable of, we won't try to prevent it from happening. As many scientific studies have shown, most people have the capacity for genuine evil within them. We all harbor the concentration camp guard or the exploiter within us. When society lacks the mechanisms to keep such behavior in check, it's all too easy for insigificant, insecure, embittered and inadequate individuals to become monsters. This is a movie about private hell and it's a salutary lesson for us all.",N/A
1391205,"I am really unsure of how to sum up On Stranger Tides in simple words. Before I begin this review, let me state 2 things: 1. I absolutely love the first three movies, and 2. To that guy who said ""the skinny girl is not in the movie"", that skinny girl is named Kiera Knightley. OK, now moving on, sort of.The first three movies were good old fashioned fun that didn't take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed them all very much and have seen them numerous times. I thought Verbinski did a hell of a job, considering he was a punk rock video director before a filmmaker. When I heard a fourth movie was being made, I got super excited. However, I had a stirring feeling of disappointment when I found out Verbinski was not directing. I'm not down with Rob Marshall- I thought Chicago was overrated and Nine was a confusing and slow mess. But, it's a Pirates movie, so I figured it'd be fun.Since I'm kinda pressed for time, I will sum up what I liked and didn't like.FIrst, the cast were great as per usual. Visually it was entertaining and the movie moved along at a nice pace... for the first hour. That, and Penelope Cruz is hot!!! And she did a great job as Angelica. Blackbeard was a cool villain, and Ian McShane does a fantastic job. There's a creepy scene involving mermaids, and that got a good reaction from those at the theatre.The bad... is everything else. First off, Barbossa is in the movie for only 20 minutes. The last hour is boring, drags a lot, and that's not all- there's a MAJOR plot hole involving the fountain of youth which is really annoying. And the 3D sucked.Overall, this is not a bad movie, but the writers are running out of ideas and it's clear.PROS:-Great acting-Hans Zimmer's score rules-Nice after the credits codaCONS-Pointless characters including the mermaid and the religious dude-About 30 minutes too long-Jack thinks far too much in this film-Drags greatly in the second half",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
106161,"29-Dec-2011The Searchers [Blu-ray] is a must-have for people who are serious about knowing and understanding Western movies. This is John Wayne's favorite ""John Wayne movie,"" and his acting is superb.The scenery of ""The Searchers"" is beautiful. Monument Valley doesn't have anything to do with cattle ranching - dude, it's DESERT - but so what? We're watching either the actors, or the sweeping landscapes. The color is absolutely true to life - the sky is blue, the scrufty plants are varying shades of green, and everything else is red. It feels a lot like being dropped onto Mars.The cast is fabulous - John Ford's cadre of western regulars is very well represented. None of them (except Wayne and possibly Ward Bond) were capable of carrying even a minor movie, but as an ensemble they all do their jobs to perfection. My favorite among the supporting cast is Bond - a perennial Wayne sidekick - playing Rev. Capt. Samuel Johnston Clayton, the preacher who is also a Captain in the Texas Rangers.If you haven't seen The Searchers, you're in for a real treat. I absolutely recommend it.[I've read a couple reviews complaining that the Blu-Ray transfer isn't wide-screen. There is a really great reason: John Ford didn't have what we would think of as wide-screen cameras. (See what I mean about knowing about movies?) In 1991, I stayed at Goulding's Lodge, the hotel in the middle of Monument Valley, which is where a number of Ford's movies were shot. The Searchers was made 40 years earlier in somewhat cruder conditions; it isn't any particular wonder if at times it appears bit grainy on a high-res display.]",N/A
348220,"Updated 9/6/2012I was just re-watching this film and decided that I needed to update my review to further reinforce my opinion of this being one of the best Criterion releases.  Lately Criterion has been putting out films with less extras and thinner booklets, yet charging in the range of $25 to $40 MSRP.  Ugetsu contains a 72 page booklet with an essay as well as the three short stories that Mizoguchi based this film on.In addition to being based on three short stories, the film is influenced by Noh and Kabuki theater.  You can hear the Kabuki style musical chanting in the background at several points in the film.  The setting is pre-Edo period Japan, so it is in the late warring states period.  The film mainly follows the two main male characters.  One man, Tobei, wants to become a samurai, the other, Genjuro, wants to acquire great wealth.  Their purpose in these achievements is also to return to their wives and flaunt their achievements.  But in gaining these fortunes, the two men inadvertently cause hardship for their spouses.I would recommend reading the booklet and watching the interviews after watching the film.  There are some interesting turns of events, and though nothing would really be a 'spoiler alert', there are some moments which are better when they surprise the viewer.  But the nature of Mizoguchi's film actually allows the viewer to guess what is coming next but still be startled, or at least slightly surprised (the 'Aha! I knew it! factor).  Despite this, the film speaks to the viewer on multiple levels.  It is a film that doesn't quite try and teach a lesson, but instead it seems to just chronicle the results of these men's foolhardy actions.  You get a sense early on about just how foolish they are when Genjuro runs back to check on his pottery kiln despite the fact that bandits are still looting his village.The film is wonderfully shot in gorgeous black and white.  There was a joke that Mizoguchi hated moving the camera, and so you do notice that the camera rarely pans.  He was also a fan of one scene, one shot; and though this was more used in his earlier films, you do tend to notice that each scene is shot in one long take or a few takes at the most.  But rarely do we see different camera angles and different takes while focusing on one scene.  Exceptions are when he uses several takes from different parts of the market when Tobei is running from his wife.  But if you notice the point where she loses him, he comes back into the shot after she leaves and into the armor peddler's tent in the same take.I also enjoyed when Mizoguchi put a lot of extras onto the screen.  The scenes which come to mind are in the market, the samurai encampment, and the whorehouse.  These are great scenes, and it shows Mizoguchi's mastery that these extras don't come off as extras but seem to blend magically into the setting and story.  Also of note, Kinuyo Tanaka (Miyagi) and Masayuki Mori (Genjuro) were two of the most noted Japanese actors in their time and were in high demand.  It is a tribute to their art that they 'got grungy' for their respective roles in this film when many Japanese actors in the 50s wouldn't dream of dirtying their image (so to speak).  Also for some fun trivia, most of the main characters were in Kurosawa films, (as well as other directors' films).  Masayuki Mori and Machiko Ky&#333; were in Rashomon together; Kinuyo Tanaka was in several Ozu films.I would argue that this is one of the most important Japanese films of all time.  I would probably say with conviction that it is the best classic Japanese film not directed by Ozu or Kurosawa.  There really is no weakness in this film.  Everything, from scenery and set design, the brilliant use of many extras, and the dialogue are near perfect.  If you have time for a break from the aforementioned directors, then this is the film you must watch.------ (Part of original review)I enjoy watching a ton of classic Criterion re-releases, but I actually check most out at my local library.  It's very rare that I actually buy one, but Ugetsu is one of those that is worthy of a purchase based on the plethora of additional content.Included are two discs full of extras such as commentary and interviews.  The 72 page book is another nice touch.  Plus Criterions masterful restoration is something to behold.  They lovingly restored one of the ultimate classic Japanese films to breathtaking levels without losing the heart and soul of the film.  Though there is some noticeable grain and sound, it is only really noticeable on very dark shots.  This is a splendid film with an enchanting story.",N/A

1310636,"I have to start out by saying that generally, I am not a person who watches romantic comedies. However, now that I'm purposely taking on movies made by the stars of 'Hawaii Five-0' so I can review them for ""Hawaii Five-0 Online,"" I've begun watching lots of movies I may have steered clear of six months ago.Having said that, I'm seriously beginning to wonder if there are other gems I've been missing considering I avoid certain genres like the plague. I've seen The Back-up Plan twice now, and as a whole, the movie is hysterically funny and heartfelt, with endearing performances by Alex O'Loughlin (Stan) and Jennifer Lopez (Zoe). And you've just got to love Zoe's dog.After having watched Mr. O'Loughlin for an entire season of a show where he plays nothing short of a bad-ass guy, albeit with a warmth that bleeds through in even his most butt-kicking moments, it was refreshing to see him in a looser comedic role. The chemistry between him and Ms. Lopez is palpable, and his smiles light up the screen right next to hers.The story itself, and indeed the movie, were absolute perfection...until it hit a certain point, when it kind of fell apart for me. Now, because this isn't your standard movie review - but instead is my gut reaction to the movie itself - the following is a bit unusual for me. But to say I was disappointed at what had so much potential as a pivotal scene later on in the movie is an understatement. I'm going to warn you, the following contains **SPOILERS** so if you don't want to know about the major conflict from the third act of the movie, don't read the next two paragraphs, which are surrounded by **!**Right after the giving-birth scene in which Zoe faceplants into the small pool and Stan is so completely shell-shocked he can barely form a coherent sentence, is the scene that did it in for me. What happened was that in a movie that was so cleverly crafted up to that point, we were suddenly thrown one of those embarrassing sitcom misunderstanding moments that not only threw me completely out of a movie I had spent the better part of the evening growing to love, but seemed so awfully contrived and out-of-place that it actually made my gut twist.****I'm talking about the moment when Zoe decides that because Stan told ""Muffin Girl"" that the babies weren't his, it means he doesn't want to be with her or them, and will leave her at some point using that as his excuse. I have to wonder why the director went with that, because as a writer, I can think of at least half a dozen ways the same scene could have gone without Zoe blowing something out of proportion the way you might find a sitcom character doing. In a sitcom, it's fast and funny and (in many cases) deliberately obtuse. In a movie that to this point was such a high-caliber piece of work, it pulled the rug out from under me and made it difficult for me to continue watching...both times.**Okay, enough spoilers! Once I forced myself past the point mentioned in the paragraphs above, I managed to enjoy the rest of the movie, for the most part...except the parts which referenced the above incident. Linda Lavin was glorious as Zoe's grandmother, and we even got Tom Bosley thrown in for good measure! They were absolutely adorable as a couple.I would have given this movie hands-down rave reviews up one side and down the other with the full amount of stars I could give if it hadn't been for my point mentioned above. But still and all? You definitely should see this movie. Lopez and O'Loughlin are brilliant together. They are both incredible actors with lots of talent and a gift for making you love their characters.And for those of you who are die-hard 'Five-0' fans, there's nothing better than seeing the man you watch on TV every week doing something different. O'Loughlin fans the world `round, who've followed him for his entire career, will tell you, ""Eh, we always knew he was that talented.""

The search for the missing person becomes metaphoric as searching for a theoretical particle. However if you can't figure it out, the movie explains it you.The comical lines spoken by Banderas were good, but it was like having someone who can't tell a joke tell you a real funny joke. Someone like a younger Bruce Willis needed to play that role. If you are going to create a movie which is a metaphor, don't explain it in the movie. The audience is supposed to figure it out for themselves. Sam Elliot was good. This could have easily been a cult classic in the style of Tarantino, but having Banderas as the lead and explaining the metaphor in the film ruined it.

(There was a scene involving a poor farm cat...)Unlike most Found Footage films, The Last Exorcism has been edited and background music has been added. Who would have found the camera and decided to produce it with the kind of serious material found inside?Ashley Bell does a good job of giving the camera creepy stares and how in the world can she go so long without blinking?Like most horror films, this has an intriguing storyline with a few twists to keep things interesting. But sadly, the ending almost ruins the film. It takes one twist too many and ends in an almost different place. Too many scary movies fall into this trap: scary movie until the ending/big reveal.The Last Exorcism is rated PG-13 for disturbing violent content and terror, some sexual references and thematic material.",N/A

492532,"4.7 starsSo glad this one got the BD transfer it deserved. One of Burton's best, and also one of Elfman's finest musical efforts. Depp is wonderfully understated and even Ryder comes off well, but Wiest is the real star here; she makes this movie. Arkin is also very funny, as is Baker. There are in fact few dramatic missteps here.The colors of the ""perfect"" '60s suburb really stand out on blu-ray and bring Burton's vision all the way home. This is as much social satire as allegory/fantasy, and rarely have housewives and the American Dream been skewered so neatly. There's a whole lot of humor mixed with the pathos, a very tough combo to pull off. Burton was at his peak here in many ways and the semi-minimal budget made him work harder than he now has to, to splendid effect.I saw this the week it came out and remember well how great it looked and felt then; this blu-ray does that original experience full justice. A great movie and a great blu-ray, even with only a commentary and short featurette as extras. It's the movie that counts, and ES shows how truly gifted and visionary Burton was, even at the start of his career. Highly recommended on every level.",Edward Scissorhands

As other reviewers have mentioned, it has no point, and is mostly a tedious trip to nowhere that really drags on at times. I love spirituality in films when it is presented in a moving and intelligent way. For that reason I really wanted to like this film. But there were so many twisted and silly elements (it presented heaven as like a sunny day in the midwest) that I fast-forwarded through most of the last act. The performances of the very talented cast are decent, but have no chance of making this film watchable. At times it's pretty to look at, and it does have some nice music -- so for that it deserves 2 stars.",The Lovely Bones
1247538,"That isn't to say that I don't appreciate Jolie's talent or enjoy her in more serious fare, but there is something about Angelina that demands your attention, and that attention is never better arrested than when Angelina is drop kicking bad guys and jumping out of moving vehicles.Surround her with explosions and she shines!`Salt' is an interesting film.  On the outset it seems like a generic action adventure film with little merit outside of Jolie's commanding presence.  Instead, what one finds is a remarkably well rounded film that understands the importance of building a story instead of staging a series of random action sequences.  The story presented in `Salt' is an engaging and thought provoking one, and while it is obviously handled in a way that puts the emphasis on the explosions, it doesn't forsake `brains' in the process.`Salt' tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt.  Apparently she's a Russian spy.  This is news to her and soon she is on the run from her former friends and colleagues who want to detain her.  She seems to be mainly concerned for her husband's wellbeing, and of course clearing her name.Twists, turns and a lot of `booms' ensue.The action is top notch here, wonderfully paced to implode in the eardrums and eye sockets of the movie-watching public; and it works great.  Angelina kicks serious booty, and the slick editing makes for a thrilling ride.  I will call caution to the film's constant violent nature.  To be honest, there are many sequences that feel almost too graphic for the film's rating.  I'm shocked that it didn't receive an R rating (that stairway execution scene in particular was very rough).  So, be mindful of the kiddies.  The acting is all what you'd expect from a film in this genre.  I want to say that I really love Liev Schreiber and really wish he'd get better roles.  He has such acting talent (I still cry when I think of his performance in `A Walk on the Moon') but he never gets to really use it.  It appears that he has Peter Sarsgaard syndrome (great actor reduced to stereotypical villain roles).HOLLYWOOD, GIVE THESE MEN BETTER ROLES!!!Alas, there is no real reason to gripe about that here, since the film is elevated with his presence, and I'm happy about that.  In the end I totally recommend this.  It's loud, abrasive and IN-YOUR-FACE, but it has depth of story that is not often found within this genre.Stand up job, if I do say so myself.",N/A
1412659,"The world of From Beginning to End resembles a fairy tale's:  a rich world, like a castle's, and therefore, in some ways, free for those who belong to it; a beautiful world and beautiful people, full of grace and gifts; a world in which nature and the elements, especially water, are part of what people take joy in almost as much as they do in one another;  and it is a world of step-siblings.  But unlike, say, the step sisters in Cinderella, or the dark fairy tale-like world of the step brothers in King Lear, the brothers are not rivals or cruel to one another.  They are, instead, lovers.  Though Francisco's father dies and the two boys' mother dies much too young as well, though death and even doubts momentarily intrude upon the boys' lives, most of this movie takes place in light.  Even many of the more dimly lit scenes, as of the brothers making love in bed or dancing, have a radiance, an inner light to them.There is something of the spirit of Latin American magic realism to this film, more so, perhaps, than there may seem to be at first viewing.  When the brothers do make and declare their love, seemingly for the first time, after their mother's death, the moment is filmed in a way that is in no sense ""naturalistic.""  It is carefully styled and artful.  The sensuality, the eroticism is thereby heightened and intensified.  Like much in magic realism, perhaps an overused term which I am borrowing for convenience's sake, the ""magic"" lies in the way its excesses, its transcendence of realism's commonsense, reveal a profounder real than realism, with its reliance on surfaces and materialism, can.  This is true of many other scenes in the movie that might look realistic at first,  though others, as when their mother joins her sons after her death as they swim or when the two brothers dance naked, bathed in a filtered amber light, clearly mean to expand the movie's world beyond naturalistic limits.  It is, after all, a film much about sight, about what Thom&agrave;s saw in his brother's eyes when the younger brother opened his own late, the shift from black and white to color mimicking in a way what the unseeing baby boy sees until his brother enters his world.  And what he sees, what color means, the movie says, is love, from beginning to the end.  In every sense, this is its vision, how it sees one with what it sees.Perhaps it is the genius of some comedies to make seem possible a world otherwise believed to be impossible.  I mean those comedies which are free from irony and the critical, skeptical side of the comic spirit.  It is a comedy at its greatest in music, rare in words, in part because it is so audacious.  How can one imagine a world in which love begins at the beginning and ends only at the end, at death, if then?  Narrative demands drama and drama demands conflict.  But From Beginning to End mostly lacks it, save in the troubles that ensue when Thom&agrave;s leaves for Russian to train for the Olympics.Before Thom&agrave;s goes, partly prodded by Francisco-a motif of love as self-surrender is introduced here-and before Francisco offers Thom&agrave;s a wedding ring (on the right hand rather than on the left, since this is another beginning as yet), Francisco reads from a book, largely in praise of men loving men, though it does speak, not kindly,  of women, too.  That passage predicts how Francisco will react to Thom&agrave;s's absence and their separation.  In a way, by reading it aloud, he is letting them both know.  It speaks of the love of male love but also of danger.  He goes out, he parties, he invites a woman he meets back to the brothers' home, he kisses her, too forcefully, in a way that hurts her some-not a passionate kiss, but a self-conscious one, it would seem.  (Perhaps it is a woman and not a man he would seduce precisely because a man would be too dangerous, too close to his own desires.)  But she sees the ring and stops their petting, obviously to Francisco's relief.  This episode is the realization of the occasional, but insistent talk about 'jealous' and 'jealousy' that Francisco usually initiates that is his serpent in the garden.  This is the ""conflict"" or threat, and Francisco must experience it, must make it overt, not just use its words.  Thom&agrave;s senses that.  It is his worry, too.  He knows, or fears, that the words Francisco has used may be becoming real.  And, yes, we do see some of that still lingering on his face in the last scene in the movie.  But he has just been listening, smiling broadly, to Francisco's reciting Shakespeare's ""Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments,"" in Portuguese of course, and then opens the door to find Francisco there, in Russia.  The last shot of all is Thom&agrave;s's smile, close to elation or, anyway, close enough to suggest that the love between them is the love of which Shakespeare's sonnet 116 speaks:  ""an ever fix&egrave;d mark.""The brothers' elation at that ""fix&egrave;d mark"" seems to me much the abiding spirit of this profound film.  Even their parents come to share in it, whatever doubts they may have had at first that their intimacy might become ""sexualized.""  As has been noted elsewhere, when the two brothers are telling each other why they love each other, Thom&agrave;s, the film's ""narrator"" at times, says, ""I love you because to understand our love they'd have to turn the world upside down.""  He's speaking of the double taboo, in many minds, of gay incest, of course.  But he's also at least intimating that their permanent love, one that endures throughout two lives for good, an intimacy so complete it is  incomprehensible, one they share throughout their lives, would also make others have to turn their world upside down.  What would the world be like if such love were real, more real than any of the stories of love told before, whether in fairy tales or novels or movies?  That is the deeper taboo no  ""realism"" could speak of it, depict, tell its story.  And even history, even art would seem to be over the centuries against it.  A love so complete, both have claimed, must notoriously end in separation or death.  Realism dictates it cannot last.What From Beginning to End dares to offer is the comedy of a permanent and complete love that breaks all the rules, that is, in effect, magical-that lives beyond the way the world is supposed to be.  The film understands the need for it to be tried, to be brought into question, and then restored.  This is, after all, the structure of comedy.  But this comedy, just as Thom&agrave;s says, requires those who affirm it to turn their world upside down, to erase their previous sense of love, founded in realism, say, and bring to it a new vision.  For From Beginning to End is in many ways a visionary film.  It may resemble fairy tales in many respects.  But it is not finally limited by their dictates and their archetypes.  It expands beyond them.  It is a movie in love with a vision of an enduring love that revisions the world.",From Beginning To End

1018071,"Do we really need a 2 disc collection with Clerks II? I remember watching the making of Clerks II and other special features about the movie. Kevin Smith sure likes to talk about how he wrote his script in Las Vegas on his laptop within a week. Granted, Kevin Smith is not known for making big budget disasters. He seems content on making low budget, goofball offensive comedies like Clerks.His first Clerks was an awakening about reality with a largely unknown cast of characters. Some of whom were friends and relatives of Smith's like his mother who played the milk maid. In this sequel, Dante and Randal's relationship (a platonic friendship and nothing more) is tested when Dante announces that he's moving to Florida with his hot fiance, Emma. In the day of a life at Mooby's, Randal has a final going away party with interesting results.Now I don't mind a two disc collection if the film had been considered a classic or revolutionary. Sometimes, I think the two disc collection here is over-rated. Kevin Smith does love his fans and appreciates them but I think he talks and smokes too much. He's not daring enough as a film-maker in order to grow.This film showed an ending and resolution to Clerks but Kevin Smith needs to grow as a director and writer in his own way. He likes complete control which is something that keeps him away from the studios. He likes his creativity but he needs to grow and search for the next project. He has made good movies like Chasing Amy, Jersey Girl, and even Dogma (one of my favorites).This two disc collection would be great for all Kevin Smith fans but I would have liked to have seen some of the original players like Marilyn Ghigliotti and those who appeared in the first film again.",Clerks II

1214976,"ZACH AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO (2008) is one of the most foul, hilarious and profound comedies I have ever seen. I suffered through this with my sides splitting as I rolled on the floor - in spite of my squeamish attitude toward X-rated ideals.Let me explain ... Zach (Seth Rogen) and Miriam (""Miri"", Elizabeth Banks) are essentially a married couple who are not married and not even very attracted to each other. That they know of, anyway. Sharing a crummy apartment and getting utilities shut off, one at a time, they attend a ten-year high school reunion where they meet an old pal.Their strapping old friend, Bobby Long (a charming and hilarious Brandon Routh) introduces them to his boyfriend, gay porno star Brandon St. Randy (Justin Long, my hero!!!) - and no, the irony of those names is not supposed to be subtle.The two, Zach and Miri, decide a pornographic film might just make them some money - that is when they discover they are truly in love. I was surprised, but the razor-sharp wit of the dialogue, the humor that cannot be described here, all of it made me think that porno and life may be something other than what we all assumed. With an essential idea borrowed from THE FULL MONTY and Monty Python-style segues, well ....The appearances by Gerry Bednob, Traci Lords and Jason ""Jay"" Mewes (the ""Jay"" half of ""Jay and Silent Bob"") elevate this film to something more than a cheap ANIMAL HOUSE-level comedy. Written and directed by Kevin Smith (the ""Silent Bob"" half of the old team) and shot on location in Pennsylvania, this has to be seen to be believed - and enjoyed fully.A word of warning: I would NOT allow anyone under 18 to view this very adult comedy. I also promise you no regrets for having enjoyed it as I only recently did. Why did I see this after resisting for three years? - because of Justin Long, duh!And the star rating is for the frankly gross sexual nature.",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

Band of Brothers shows, from a very bottom up perspective, the human condition during one of the largest events in human history to date.

From training to the end of WWII in Europe the story focuses on a small group of men that live, eat, sleep, train, fight and some times die together.

1389887,"First off, I don't watch much TV and we don't even have cable television in our house, just cable internet. I never heard of this series until it was offered through the Amazon Vine program. Out of curiosity I ordered it, thinking I'd watch the first episode or two and formulate a review.Well good thing there are only 8 episodes because otherwise I'd have spent a lot more time watching this instead of doing whatever I should have been doing. Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop because I had to see what was going to happen next.You can get the basic plot details from the other reviews posted here. What I want to say is that I got addicted because of the quality of the plots and the acting - I became immersed in the series and felt like someone who was actually there with this small band of survivors, feeling constantly on edge because of the dangers to which they were exposed and also imagining a world in which something like this actually happened.One thing I want to point out is that it is a very gruesome show - most definitely the scenes of violence and bloodshed are graphic and disturbingly real so if that kind of stuff bothers you, then I'd suggest watching something else. It's a virtual hackfest of blood spraying all over the place and body parts flying in all directions. This is not solely for shock value, though - it is just part of the overall experience of watching this series, and part of what I feel are very intelligently written and believably acted plots.While I am not planning on getting cable television just to watch season 2, I am looking forward to the new season so that they can hurry up and release it on DVD.

1262688,"As of submitting this review, I just finished watching Camille for the first time. I didn't quite know what to expect from the movie as most of the reviews seemed to be evenly spread on Amazon and has a just above average rating on IMDb. But it sounded like a movie I'd enjoy so I decided to check it out. I was somewhat surprised actually. It's not a particularly great movie but a good movie nonetheless.The movie follows newlywed couple Silas and Camille. Silas is a petty thief on parole who has recently married his parole officer's niece. This is more a marriage of convenience for Silas as he's truly only wanting to get to Canada. Camille however actually does love Silas though she somewhat starts to think early on he might not return the feeling.On their way to Niagara Falls, the two are involved in a motorcycle crash in which it's discovered later that Camille really did die in the crash. Feeling guilty over what happened, Silas starts being kinder to Camille and the two slowly and truly begin enjoying their honeymoon trip all the while back home, a local sheriff believes Silas has murdered Camille and they go after the two.The movie actually is a fairly sweet romantic comedy. Good news for guys is that it seems to be pretty evenly directed at both genders and not obviously directed at just women like some romantic comedies.  The ending was definitely pretty touching. As far as te actors, I really enjoyed David Carridine as Cowboy Bob the most though all the actors did pretty well.

1396699,"Wow. This set is wonderful. I love Italian movies, especially Italian CRIME movies and this one does not disappoint. Fernandao Di Leo knows how to film action (gunplay) scenes. It's better than most modern movies.First up is CALIBER 9. It's about a guy who gets of prison and everyone wants to know where the money is. What money? Well, our guy Ugo says he doesn't know. No one believes him. Ugo doesn't care. He's a tough, quiet guy who is similar to Jason Statham. I won't ruin it for you but the end is pretty great.Next is THE ITALIAN CONNECTION, about a small time pimp who gets in over his head and ends up getting a price on it. Then they hurt him in a way they should never had and well....it's revenge time. I liked this a bit better than CALIBER 9. What's unique is that there is a team of two hitman, one black and one white (Henry Silva and Woody Strode) and you can't help but realize that's where Tarantino got the idea for the hitmen team in Pulp Fiction. Great stuff.Up third is THE BOSS with Henry Silva again. He plays a cold-blooded killer. Some of the parts are excellent but as a whole I'm not sure it's as good as THE ITALIAN CONNECTION.Last is RULERS OF THE CITY (aka MR. SCARFACE which you can find on butchered public domain copies). Jack Palance is somewhat out of place as a crime boss in Italy. What separates this film from the others is that parts of it is quite funny. Our two ""heroes"" are somewhat bumbling. The last fifteen minutes or so is pure action with cars and motorcycle chases, shoot-outs, etc. Overall, pretty satisfying.As a whole, this set is close to perfect.

1161228,"Arrange a competition around surviving the night in a haunted house, and I will watch it.  I guess that means I'm part of the reason why bad low budget movies like Death on Demand keep getting made.  All is not a total loss here, though - sure, the acting is atrocious and the script is juvenile, but there's a decent amount of gore involved.For any insane killer, there's always someone more than willing to exploit that person's crimes for material gain.  Twenty years ago, ice climber Sean McIntyre returned home (after losing it on a climb and killing his Sherpa guide because he thought he was a Yeti) to his loving family, only to slaughter all of them and then hang himself.  Now, a young entrepreneur has put together a Halloween night webcast in the house, giving one of three local college couples a chance at winning five grand - if they can solve all of the clues scattered around the place and find their way out.  Eager to prove himself to his doubting father, he's somehow managed to replace one of the original contestants with adult film star Velvet Luv in order to sell more online subscriptions.  Velvet is partnered up with an emo lesbian (whose voice is even more annoying than Fran Drescher's), while the other couples consist of two antagonistic football jocks (Biff and Brad) and their girlfriends.  Brad and Biff epitomize all of the worst stereotypes you've ever heard about football players - and they dislike each other intensely.  After a s&eacute;ance to call up the spirit of Sean McIntyre, the contest finally begins.  It's fun to watch the reaction of the contestants' buddies back at the dorm, but the action inside the house is just stupid and boring.  Of course, we all know what's going to happen to these annoying characters.Apart from the gore, it doesn't look as if anyone made any effort whatsoever to make this a movie worth watching.  This is truly a film that only a bad movie lover can possibly enjoy.  Those without a weird sense of humor and a weakness for really stupid movies may find themselves fantasizing about the death of director Adam Matalon and everyone else involved in this embarrassingly bad film.",Death on Demand

1364406,"The Company Men explores the very contemporary issues of the effect of redundancy during a recession and its specific effect on the personal lives of the people at the receiving end of the dreaded layoff notice. There are several stages to the process. Firstly, from the corporate perspective the company, in this case a company in shipbuilding, is under enormous pressure to perform for its stockholders as the economic slump bites and orders fall off. The all too predictable response is to cut costs and since payroll is the biggest cost, this means cutting jobs.The axe cuts deep and the company is forced to make difficult decisions to terminate long serving and loyal staff. The film focuses on three of these people and explores the various personal issues involved. There is initial incredulity and some bitterness that they could have been treated in this way, but optimism about finding a new job. Then realisation that it is difficult in a harsh economic climate for someone of 37 to find employment, let alone someone nearing retirement. People react in different ways to both the emotional issues of being out of a job and the economic implications and most of the film focuses on these aspects.This an interesting and absorbing film, but in many ways depressing as the situation it describes is one which many people will be able to relate to or will have experienced at some stage in their lives. Ben Affleck plays a confident Sales Director, Chris Cooper is the older, senior executive, who has worked his way up from the shop floor and Tommy Lee Jones is one of the company's founders and a senior statesman. Affleck is particularly outstanding and his reaction to the economic reality of his new status is quite revealing as the trappings of his middle class life style are impacted. You may not feel a lot of sympathy for the plight of these guys as they are obviously well off, but expenditure grows to the level of income and when the income stops............So to summarise, a worthwhile film which explores important and real life issues, but certainly not a light hearted way to while away an hour or two.",N/A

295910,"""The Exterminating Angel"" is a film about a group of sophisticated, professional members of the haute bourgeoisie, who have presumably just been to the opera, and are now attending the after-party at a luxurious mansion, who apr&egrave;s-diner find themselves mysteriously trapped in a swanky living room.  The film itself is a metaphor for those who are suffocated by their institutions, be they professional or religious--IE later in the film, a similar scenario begins to play itself out in the local cathedral.  The message is plain: Bu&ntilde;uel is telling the audience, as usual, BEWARE THE DANGERS OF CONVENTIONALITY.  ""Exterminating Angel"" does contain elements that date back to Bu&ntilde;uel's roots in Surrealism (IE the Inexplicable Presence of a Bear and Flocks of Sheep, the Hand of the Dead Man that Moves by Itself, the Feverish Dreams of the Exhausted Partygoers, Occasional Nonsensical Dialogue among the Guests).  Yet despite the frequent touches of Bu&ntilde;uel's humour, the atmosphere of this film more closely resembles ""The Twilight Zone"" (in the best sense)--by presenting a nightmarish separate reality, out of context, that is not only surreal, but hyperreal.  As for the supplemental material on CD 2, the interviews with both Silvia Pinal (she relates how she often discussed ""Exterminating Angel"" with Bu&ntilde;uel while acting in the film; she comes across and genuine and sincere) and director Arturo Ripstein are very good.  However, the documentary, ""The Last Script: Remembering Luis Bu&ntilde;uel"" (2008), featuring Bu&ntilde;uel's son, director Juan Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, is far too long.  Although I have great respect for Mr. Bu&ntilde;uel, the documentary's various cast members go on and on--ad infinitum, ad nauseum--sycophantically waxing poetic about Bu&ntilde;uel's greatness: half an hour could easily have been edited out of this 90 minute documentary.  I have to think that Bu&ntilde;uel himself would have been against that kind of self-promotional adoration, even when directed towards him.  However, ""Last Script: Remembering Luis Bu&ntilde;uel"" does have its highlights, including black and white stills taken by Bu&ntilde;uel, and the following quote by Carri&egrave;re: ""Bu&ntilde;uel had a Comic / Spanish Obsession with Death"".Stephen C. Bird, author of ""Hideous Exuberance""",The Exterminating Angel VHS
711671,"I saw The Pacific first and didn't think it could be beaten.  I don't know how I missed this one when it first came out.  I'd heard of it, but never saw it.  I have to admit that this is truly one amazing series.  While I still like The Pacific, I finished watching this one in less time because I was so captivated with the story.  I also liked the interviews with the real soldiers at the beginning and on the extras DVD.  I'm glad those interviews and the reunion were recorded while they were still alive.This series and The Pacific really show the truth behind WWII and what those men had to endure.  I was especially enamored with the episode about the medic because I was an army medic years ago.  It was very easy to sympathize with him since I know many medics during war time (then and now) are targeted.My DVD's arrived two days past the estimated arrival date, but I can't complain since it was Christmas week.  All DVDs were in great condition and none missing as I've seen reported.  I was surprised the series was not shot in widescreen, but that didn't deter from the quality of the program.I highly recommend this series as well as The Pacific, but I think I'm leaning more toward Band of Brothers as my new favorite between the two.  I'm glad I have both and hope to see more.  This series could have cost twice what I paid for it and it would still be worth it.",N/A
802727,"Considering how much I've come to despise Judd Apatow as a creator, director and producer, he was a force to be reckoned with in his early days. Freaks and Geeks is a pretty great show, and I recommend it to anyone. From beginning to end, there is very little to dislike about this show.The DVD set is chock full of commentary, by almost everyone involved in the show. If you're into that, you'll learn so much more about Freaks and Geeks then you ever thought possible.UPCOMING SPOILER ALERTSAs far as the show itself - SPOILER ALERT: (Maybe) - does anyone else know why Busy Philipps isn't included in the main cast? You've got every geek and every freak, but where is Kim Kelly, Daniel's angry girlfriend and Lindsay's (eventual) close friend? She's in every single episode, she's pivotal to many storylines, and has her own backstory and evolution just like all the other characters. I would say that Kim Kelly is a more fully evolved character than both Ken (Seth Rogen) or Bill Haverchuck (Martin Starr) but they are both ""main"" characters, both included in the cast photography on the box and part of the opening theme. It seems strange that there are two fully developed female characters in the show, ostensibly as main characters, but only one (Linda Cardellini) is an official ""main"" character. The others are all male, giving this odd lopsided perspective that there were just more boys than girls in high schools.MORE SPOILER ALERTS: This is an unfortunate pattern in all of Apatow's productions to treat it like a ""no girls allowed"" universe. I also think it's interesting that of the freaks, geeks, stoners, etc, the majority of the ""weird"" characters are male, while almost all of the female (high school) characters in the show are cheerleaders and/or hot and popular. Girls are mostly invisible in this show, and portrayed (mostly) as untouchable ""goddesses"" on pedestals. There's Lindsay and Kim, of course, as well as Lindsay's nerdy friend Millie, but most of the high school girls we see are cheerleaders. Isn't that odd? Even Lindsay is given the pedestal treatment by Nick, which destroys what could otherwise be a perfectly healthy high school relationship.Okay, so I have criticisms of the show, obviously. But I stand by my 5 stars because, despite it's flaws, Freaks and Geeks is an amazing show with powerfully developed characters. It's all the more impressive because it only lasted one, 18-episode season.",N/A
492523,"Big Tim Burton fan so it's not a surprise I bought this movie.I love how the menu starts. It's a pop-up affect, which I appreciated. Most DVDs are just the title of the movie, menu options and a screenshot from the movie. So just want to throw that out there.Great movie if you haven't seen it. A lovely blend of comedy, fantasy, and romance with that Tim Burton touch that he's known for. A dark child-like creature in the middle of Suburbia (love the pastels!).

It is the continuing true story of Jill Kinmont the Olympic hopeful in skiing who had a tragic accident that left her alive but with so many challenges to meet afterward. She finds her way in the world through teaching and in meeting her husband-to-be John Boothe. This sequel is mainly about her courtship, romance and eventual marriage to John. Marilyn Hassett and Timothy Bottoms do great jobs portraying Jill and John. It is very moving inspiring and real. REAL LOVE does happen for some people in this life and this couple found it with each other. Jill's mother has always been Jill's caretaker so John must learn how to take on that responsibility. Jill has some serious emotional challenges to work through before she can marry John. In the end they marry and are now livivg in Bishop California where they both grew up.

1345299,"When I first realized there was a possible underlying religious theme to this movie, I rolled my eyes and thought about shutting it off, because I am an antitheist. But, I enjoy Matt Damon's acting, and it was a very clever movie up until that point, so I kept watching. In the end, I was glad I hadn't stopped watching.This film has everything many of us want in a movie and then some. It's sci-fi, action, humor, drama, suspense and romance... and only just enough of each genre to make it an enjoyable movie. It's a great date movie, but it's also a great solo movie as well, if you are prone to ""deeper than sheep"" thinking.The movie makes a very clear statement about theology and our responsibilities as humans... that we have the power to create our own destinies and make our own paths, if we really want to and if we believe in ourselves - instead of believing our fate is predetermined by a higher power or fate.Unfortunately, we never see the beautiful Emily Blunt or Matt Damon wearing the clothes in which they're pictured on the front cover or the movie poster, which I think is bad marketing... trying to make a movie more physically attractive than it already is. Boo on you, marketing profs!But, aside from that, this is now one my favorite films. It's a very clever twist on an old story, and everyone involved in the production did a fantastic job in creating this movie. Bravo!",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

202810,"This movie isn't as bad as some reviewers make it to be. Movies are about fantasy and sometimes we need to suspend belief. Sure it's hard to imagine the Duke as Genghis Khan, but he physically looks the part. Vocally, his speaking drawl was a detriment. Susan Hayward is drop dead gorgeous and watching her shimmy during the sword dance sequence was a real treat. She is defiant, fiery, and dignified. Hayward was one of my favorite actresses and she didn't receive credit due until her masterpiece performance in ""I Want To Live.""  Overall, you get to view spectacular scenery, good fight sequences, the Duke as you've never seen before, and the wonderfully talented and beautiful Susan Hayward for 110 minutes in technicolor. Also many of the cast and crew died of cancer possibly related to filming close to nuclear testing.

1072448,"Do you remember the hype that was Episode I?I remember hearing rumors early in the 90's that the long anticipated prequels would happen, many years passed before I caught my first glimpse of Episode I on a grainy over the air broadcast of Entertainment Tonight. Those next few months were agonizing since I couldn't wait to see the first Star Wars film in 16 years, however there was a question that I feared, what if it sucks?Well, unfortunately we all know how the prequels turned out and they are a pale imitation of the vastly superior original trilogy (pre-special edition screw ups).By 1999, Lucas was no longer a filmmaker and was a savvy business man who knows how to make a buck (or a billion) and made the prequels as two hour long commercials to sell more toys that bare the Star Wars name.The plot was convoluted, the acting was stiff and wooden under his direction, annoying comic relief (I'm looking at you Jar Jar), and the special effects were not that special. Call me old fashioned but the slick look of CGI is jarring and takes me out of the action, give me props, models and costumes!The movies were marginally better with each release with Episode III the only one I would consider re-watching at this point (not completely void of cringe worthy moments).I don't completely hate the films, there are a few things that I do enjoy but as a whole, I just can't get into 'em anymore!",N/A
325461,"Some random thoughts after recently rewatching after a very long time the 1977 TV miniseries JESUS OF NAZARETH Directed by Franco Zefferelli. First off the dvd presentation screws things up by, instead of it being in its original episode form, some bright bulb decided to cut out the end and begining credits making it one long eight hour movie........which ruins the film's inner dramatic structure.That said it is still probably the third best version of the Life of The Christ, the second best sound version and the one the most accesible to non-Christians though of course still not to atheist bigots. While there is still the odd miracle, they are VERY VERY lowkey and left unexplained. Presumably to allow viewers of that bent to come up with their own explanations. Other elements are simply not presented. Jesus is never shown meeting Satan or walking on water for example. A great deal of time is spent of Israel's political situation at the time regarding the Zealots, the Sanhedrin, the Roman occupation and the two Herods thus putting Jesus within the context of his times. The film bends over backwards--perhaps too much--to avoid any criticism of any Jews for Jesus' death but this also tends to diminish the roles of Caiphas and necesitates the creation of, I believe, a fictional character named Zerah do the actual dirty work of getting Jesus dead. The film seems harsh towards the Zealots---Judas being one---and goes close to blaming them as the real reason for Jesus being killed. It is hard to tell but one hopes this was not a veiled attack on Zionism.Though it has more time to tell the story, it is odd what the film cuts. Minor things like Pilate  not washing his hands for example and the centurian does not say ""Surely this man was the Son of God."" I wonder why?That all said. This is a first rate production. Well directed. Nice score and a glorious cast not just of major names like Rod Steiger, Olivia Hussey and Christopher Plummer but in smaller roles one can spot such diverse actors as Simon MacCorkindale, Martin Benson and Frances De Wolf. Robert Powell makes for a fine Jesus which is an immensley difficult role to play. The film should be of interest to fantasy/horror/sci fic genre fans as besides the names already mentioned Donald Pleasance(who played Satan in THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD) and James Earl Jones both appear pre HALLOWEEN and post STAR WARS respectively.  Michael Yorke needs to be seen to be believed as John the Baptist. He is that good.  Ralph Richardson, James Mason and Lawrence Olivier all appear as does Anne Bankcroft, Ernest Borgnine, Anthony Quinn, Ian Holm, James Farrentino, Ian Mcshane and Stacy Keach among others I am probably forgetting.Watching Peter Ustinov's superb performance as Herod the Great, I suddenly realized that appearing in historical epics was, along with playing Hercule Poirot, a major aspect of his career.All in all a solid historical film about the Life of the Christ and well worth the time of any fan of the history of that period.",N/A

263584,"I was but a strapping lad of 18, in my first year at an engineering school, when I first saw Zardoz. My classmates were unanimously scornful - ""What the hell is this?""  they asked. But I was fascinated - an early sign that my days in the sciences were numbered - with small numbers at that. But 35 years later, the film still beguiles me -- more for its wacky charm and for its effort to send a Message.Zardoz is about a tripartite system of humans in 2293 - in other words, wicked far into the future. At the top of the heap is an ever-youthful race of Eternals, who live in agrarian bliss inside protected bubbles called the Vortex. They live the trippy 1970s dream of agrarian hippies - gathering wheat and  baking bread - wearing skimpy tops and meditating. At the bottom of the social pile is a dirty, heaving mass of Brutals, eking out a living in burnt-out cities. Life not being miserable enough, they are beset by gun-wielding, horse-riding Enforcers, who shoot them down at every opportunity. Both Brutals and Enforcers worship Zardoz, an enormous flying stone head, who demands sacrifices of grain, and bestows guns and ammo to the Enforcers. When Zed, an Enforcer (played by a bare-chested, pigtailed Sean Connery) stows aboard Zardoz along with a load of grain, he comes into contact with the Eternals. They consider him a beast, but are fascinated by his existence as well as his virility - an aspect of humanity they have deemed expendable.Up to this point, Zardoz seems like a silly film about an effeminate race trying to get back its mojo. But there's a lot more going on than meets the eye. Zed's existence spawns an existential crisis in the Eternals, who are starting to question the value and validity of their system. Is Zed really a subhuman slave? Or does his existence suggest superiority? Is the Vortex a safe haven or a boring and inescapable trap? The Eternals are anxious to keep such thoughts at bay, and isolate those who disagree. These renegades are sentenced to age, and to dodder on blissfully on the margins of their world.The first half of Zardoz was well-paced and a helluva lot of fun. Connery was aptly laconic as terrific as the cold-hearted, hot-blooded Zed, playing him with often hilarious reserve. Consuella (Charlotte Rampling), the female leader and enemy of Zed, was all icy rage and purpose. Quite a horsewoman too! The idea of a flying ""god head"" was inventive, funny and awesome. The questions at the heart of the film were intriguing. But new ideas and themes and images kept piling up, with no end (and no easy resolution) in sight. Characters who spent the whole movie as enemies suddenly (in the span of a single sentence) became allies and lovers. Forces that were all-powerful succumbed after the lightest of probings. The effects were primitive (really - how many mirrored halls can one movie show?),  and the skimpy wardrobe hilarious (the film has more boobs than a National Geographic special. But the acting was unironic, the script great. plot twists brilliant and the ending perfect.All this indeed make Zardoz a messy failure, as my classmates believed, but a noble and even daring one.  Zardoz found a boldly imagistic way to explore the value of mortality and to question whether the wealthy and connected can establish societies that benefit hem to the detriment and exclusion of others. Zardoz touches on politics, death, religion and freedom. Not bad for a silly sci-fi flick.",Zardoz VHS

1221252,"""Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon"" is pretty much a standard SyFy channel offering, with the exception that it's set in the early 1900's. This was definitely not the best movie I've ever seen, but I can't say it was the very worst I've ever seen, either. Mildy entertaining, but at times I found my mind wandering. I give it 2.5 stars, so I rounded up to 3.Fans of Stargate SG-1 will appreciate seeing Michael Shanks (SG-1's Daniel) and J.R. Bourne (SG-1's Martouf). Oddly enough Michael Shanks is an archeologist here, too. I won't detail the storyline as others have already done so.I realize this is from SyFy, and that life isn't all roses, but I was kind of surprised at the amount of gore, some of it was quite gross. I haven't seen it quite this bad with SyFy's other movies. Since this is a TV movie and it's ""not rated"", I wanted to point this out. (I would rate it at least pg-13 due to the gore.)A few examples: a man gets shot in the forehead with an arrow, someone commits suicide and chunky-looking blood is shown hitting the wall, a couple of people are cut open on an alter (while conscious) and their hearts are taken out while blood runs down their sides, and the worst was when a man had half his head cut off at a steep angle in a booby-trap. While we're talking about content, there are no bedroom scenes, however a man makes an inappropriate comment when he finds a woman looking for something in his tent. Hopefully this partial content review will help someone make a more informed decision! :)I really can't see watching this more than once...while I did watch the whole thing, I have no desire to ever see it again. At times it wasn't too bad, but other (most) times I was anxious for it to be over. If you're curious, rent it or try to catch it on Syfy, but I wouldn't recommend making a decision to buy it until after you've seen it.",Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon

1370064,"""The Bisbee Cannibal Club"" is an extremely low budget attempt at a comedy, and there are, to be certain, moments that almost made me laugh. But that's really the best I can say for this film.The story involves the discovery by a group of Bisbee, Arizona, locals that there is an organized group of cannibals in the town. The locals form a group to fight against the cannibals (who, by the way, prey only on vegetarians). With this set-up, the film is mostly slapstick, albeit at times gory slapstick. There is a scene, for example, in which one of the cannibals is being chased. He runs past an empty pizza box, stops, goes back to the box, and looks inside in hope of food. That scene was mildly amusing. On a similar level were the multiple bat-to-the-head strikes that were somewhat amusing, though I'm not sure they were intended to be so.The end result is a film that is not especially funny, not in the least bit frightening, and not quite bad enough to make watching the entire thing unbearable.

After watching two disappointing films, the third just makes me want to dig a hole in the back yard and curl up into a fetal position. I don't seem to see what is good about these films, so I must be going crazy.This film is poorly written, the acting talent is not even there. The worst part is that there are two decent young actresses in this film in Dakota Fanning and Bryce Dallas Howard. Yet, they barley get any screen time in this movie. For a movie that was suppose to give me an incredible epic battle of Vampire vs. Vampire and Ware-wolf...I am left with just a cheap blur of second rate special effects. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson again horrible and Taylor Lautner is so pathetic in his delivery of dialogue. I mean...""Let's face it...I'm hotter than you???!!!'

I also have nothing against Pattinson because I loved him in the film 'Water For Elephants' Frankly, once Twilight is over he will be able to bask in the glory in all of his Twilight royalties, and even if Twilight keeps getting the MTV best movie awards, I feel that in about 20 years no one will even understand the question 'So what are you, team Edward or Jacob?'",N/A
571580,"Vampire Circus (1972) is an excellent Hammer horror film that mixes vampires and a circus.  It stars Adrienne Corri, Thorley Walters, Anthony Higgins, and David Prowse (Darth Vader in Star Wars episodes IV, V, and VI).Basically, the movie takes place in an Austrian village in the 19th century.  A little girl is killed by a vampire, Count Mitterhaus.  The villagers kill this vampire in revenge for killing the girl.  Years later this village suffers from the ravages of the plague.  Some fifteen years later, a circus comes to town which actually consists of vampires.  That's all I want to say about the plot so I don't spoil everything for you.  Watch to find out what happens.This movie has lots of blood and gore, some full nudity, and some decent special effects for a low budget Hammer movie.  The circus atmosphere and props are pretty decent, as are the costumes.  The circus animals are amazing and appear to be well trained.  Watch for the dancing tiger woman.  She's a sight to see.  This movie possesses a sort of dark fairy tale atmosphere mixed with pure circus horror.  The movie has that classic low budget Hammer look and feel to it - somewhat cheaply made, but the cheapness is made up for with the story, attitude, and scariness.This DVD package actually contains two DVDs - a regular DVD and a Blu-Ray DVD.  The extras include a documentary called The Bloodiest Show On Earth: Making Vampire Circus, a featurette called Gallery Of Grotesqueries: A Brief History Of Circus Horrors, a featurette called Visiting The House Of Hammer: Britain's Legendary Horror Magazine, a motion comic book called Vampire Circus: Motion Comic Book, a still and poster gallery, and the theatrical trailer.I recommend this movie because it's one of the better Hammer films and is a film that ranks pretty high on the all-time list of best vampire flicks in movie history, according to many fans.",N/A

The cinematography and ambience of the bleak desert is excellent.  And still I couldn't quite rid myself of a nagging question.An Apache warrior is trying to ""rescue"" his young son and his mother, a white woman who was captured by the Indians many years ago.  I realize that the stalker forced his advances on the woman, but the son is completely innocent.  Obviously the father was attentive to the son, and there is some reason to believe that the boy would like to be with his father.  Thus, there is a puzzlement:  does the father deserve some sympathy, or should all our sympathy be for the white woman and her rescuer?  I couldn't help but relate this to the case of Elian Gonzales and the father who wanted to retrieve the young son from his ""rescuers.""And it is this puzzle that made me like the movie, that made me wonder what this movie would have been, had it been told from the point of view of the Apache father.",N/A

I say this despite the cheesy music, the low-budget look, and the accent issues that seem to have put off so many other Amazon reviewers.  ""Wish Me Luck"" had an actual former agent as technical advisor and it shows.  I couldn't believe how much information they were able to pack into this first season: the mysogyny of some in the SOE, the personalities of Buckmaster and Atkins, British class issues, French collaboration, French political issues, French anti-Semitism, realistic details regarding training and clandestine work, and even the idea of sacrificing agents for the greater good.

1388547,"""Pregnancy Pact"" is another Lifetime Channel movie that straddles the uneasy line between well meaning social commentary and lurid melodrama. A ripped from the headlines plot is inspired by the Massachusetts case that received national news coverage involving an extremely high preponderance of high school girls getting (you guessed it) pregnant. The real life story was, without doubt, fascinating and disturbing. So I held out hope that the hype surrounding the actual circumstances might elevate Lifetime to produce an accounting of more substance than their usual output. A cast of unknowns--except the A grade talent of Thora Birch, Nancy Travis, and Camryn Manheim--is stranded with a lackluster and obvious script that hopes to illuminate the issue of teen pregnancy but really just makes everyone seem a bit (or a lot) foolish.The premise, obviously, has some merit being grounded by actual events. And the movie starts out promisingly enough. A school nurse (Manheim) pursues more awareness in the schools after having administered a ridiculously high percentage of pregnancy tests in the preceding year. Unbeknownst to the conservative authority figures, a group of girls are actively seeking to bring babies into the world. One of the primary proponents of an abstinence only education is Travis, but she soon gets blind-sided that her perfect daughter may be caught up in a bigger scandal. Luckily a roving Internet blogger (Birch) is on hand to blow the lid off the story. If it sounds a bit odd to have a blogger doing the legwork--well, it is!It all boils down to expected stereotypes--different factions and different politics--everyone is represented in some rudimentary form. The girls themselves are particularly silly--even villainous as painted by the film. The film really shies away from coming to any sort of real societal conclusions. Instead, we're treated to the melodramatic trappings of generic moralizing. With plenty of music montages, you know that healing and forgiveness can't be far behind. ""Pregnancy Pact"" takes compelling true life drama and whitewashes away any real discussion of the issues for a quick and easy conclusion. But that's really no surprise, is it? KGHarris, 12/10.",N/A

1420694,"""Farewell"" (L'affaire Farewell) is a Cold War espionage thriller inspired by the real-life case of Vladmir Vetrov, a KGB officer who, in the 1980s, gave the French domestic intelligence agency DST the names of KGB agents in the West who were involved in industrial and technological espionage. While there are obvious similarities in Vetrov's story and that of the characters in the film (e.g. Vetrov passed information through a French engineer of his acquaintance), Vetrov was a good deal more careless, and drunk, than his likeness in the film, which was a fatal flaw. Director Christian Carion adapted the screenplay from Serguei Kostine's nonfiction book ""Bonjour Farewell: La verit&eacute; de la taupe franaise du KGB.""In 1981, a French engineer working in Moscow, Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet), gets deeper into the espionage business than he intended when a favor for the French security agency DST puts him in contact with a high-ranking KGB officer who wants to pass secrets. Col. Sergei Grigoriev (Emir Kusturica) thinks the Soviet Union needs a new revolution and that it will only have one if the supply of pilfered technology from the West is cut off. He intends to expose the network of Soviet spies called Line X. Pierre is uneasy in his role but can't bring himself to quit. French President Mitterand (Phillipe Magnan) receives regular reports on the project, as does US President Ronald Reagan (Fred Ward), who is surprised to learn that the US space and air defense programs were an open book.Most of ""Farewell"" takes place in Moscow in the early to mid-1980s. The period detail is interesting in itself. It's a character drama with tension but without suspense until the final act. Pierre Froment is an anxious man, Grigoriev a disillusioned dreamer. ""I can change the world,"" he says. Maybe he could. Vladamir Vetrov cut off the Soviet Union's supply of new technologies just as the empire was buckling under financial pressures, hastening the USSR's demise. But ""Farewell"" is mostly quiet, carried by the performances of Kusturica and Canet. Pierre is an everyman, while Grigoriev is a sympathetic, if flawed, hero. There is a lot to like in this trip back to the Cold War. In French and Russian with English subtitles that cannot be turned off.

I will be honest, I was worried about Adele having so many throat problems while on tour and when she had surgery in early summer, I was expecting a drastic notice in her voice.

There were several sets available at the time; ""Drive-In"" ""Sci-Fi"" ""Horror"" and ""Western"" but I picked ""Mystery"" because it seemed like the detective genre is the hardest to mess up.  I've seen atrociously bad movies in all those other categories, but I've never seen a classic mystery movie which I didn't like on some level.  I made the right choice.  Some of these movies are silly, some are stupid, the writing & situations are occasionally painful (the inexplicable casting of Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, and Bela Lugosi as Asian characters for example, or the excruciating no-deduction-required ""It was Moriarty!"" conclusion of all the Sherlock Holmes movies.) But some of these are actually (amazingly) good ... and all of them are at least WATCHABLE.  It took me months to get through the whole collection, and after each movie I congratulated myself on scoring this incredible entertainment deal which amounted to something like 40 cents per movie (plus tax.)All of these movies are black & white except for one.  ""The Man on the Eiffel Tower"" is in a Technicolor so washed-out it's more of a duochrome orange & navy blue.  It is also one of the worst movies in the entire collection, with an insufferable villain and a pathetic misuse of the great Charles Laughton in a role that required no acting.  Black & white holds up rather well through the various stages of optical & video transfer these movies suffered before being digitized, so picture quality (with a few exceptions) is actually Pretty Good.  Sound quality is uneven; none of the soundtracks could be considered ""clean"" but some were definitely more murky than others.  In a few I noticed that the optical soundtrack's surface noise combined with digital audio artifacts to create the illusion of somebody frying bacon or twisting a giant sheet of bubble wrap somewhere just offscreen...For entertainment value you just cannot beat this collection.  There's something endearingly wholesome in the naive moral outlook of some of these movies.  The films are arranged by category and in loose chronological order, so if you watch the disks in order you can see a slow progress from the optimism of ""good guys vs bad guys"" detective stories of the 1930s to the depressing grittiness of later Film Noir.  The newest movie in this set is ""Suddenly,"" a tight, tense drama starring Frank Sinatra in an unforgettable role from 1954.  The oldest is 1931's ""Murder at Midnight"" with a meandering plot, bumbling police, and the poorest sound & picture quality in the batch.  Quality ranges all between these extremes.  Nevertheless this set is worth getting if you like old-fashioned crime & detective stories.

1264361,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.  I recently watched the earliest BBC version of Emma and was disappointed.  I was expecting similar acting in this film, but from the first half hour, I could tell I wouldn't feel that way.  I was tempted to write a review before I finished watching it, I was so pleased!What I enjoy most about this film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility is the cast!  Elinor was just wonderful.  One other reviewer commented that she was made attractive, whereas most Elinors in other adaptations were made to look plain.  I too, enjoyed that Elinor was beautiful in this movie.  In truth, I don't remember from the book whether Elinor is supposed to be plain or attractive.Marianne was, I think very good.  There were a couple of times she seemed to be over the top, but from what I remember of the story, that could be a reasonable portrayl.Edward was very good.  Mrs. Jennings was fabulous.  The Misses Steeles were very good, I thought.  A big improvement over some some of the later movies.  Willoughby was fine - I don't think the audience is given enough time to be drawn to him.  Sir John Middleton, outrageous as he is, does seem to fit the book, as I remember it.There are two reasons I gave this adaptation a four rather than a five.  The first is that there were several marked differences in dialogue and events.  The youngest Miss Dashwood is eliminated, which I think is unfortunate, as her presence helps to endear Edward to the audience (and to Elinor).  Also, at the end of the story, Elinor's emotional outburst has been eliminated.  I felt that THAT was an inexcusable omission.  Elinor is so calm throughout the story that her emotions getting the better of her is a very significant part of the story.  There were other, smaller, differences as well. It is still decently faithful, even with those changes.The second reason is that the ending seemed a bit awkward.  It sort of just fades out, and it doesn't feel like it should end there.  I found that unfortunate, since I felt that the execution of the film was very good throughout the whole three hours . . until the very last two minutes!One other difficulty (which had no affect on my rating) was that the camera seemed at times to be unfocused.But I really enjoyed it throughout!  The acting in the very first minute or two felt ""stagy"" (a term a couple of other reviewers have used), but it really didn't feel that way to me for the rest of the movie.",Sense and Sensibility
970151,"An excellent story set early in the last century about a stuffy English butler who's services are gambled away by an Earl, to an older American couple who live in the wild west.  Each tries to convert the other into their version of a model citizen but the kind, self-reliant spirit of independance from the couple and their frontier friends helps Ruggles break out of his shell with surprisingly funny results.

299912,"Ken Russell's Tchaikovsky opus, while not quite given the release it deserves, is here available in the best version since the film caused such a hue and cry on it's original cinema release over 40 years ago.I don't want to wish my life away, but I'd loved to have seen the hullabaloo: a fried homosexual married to a deranged nymphomaniac! Those oh-so-earnest arts programmes which inspired so many of those infinitely more entertaining Monty Python sketches, aghast at the treatment of one of orchestral music's guiding lights, yet pragmatically defending the artist's right to free expression and establishment non-intervention....Lovely.Proper culture.Looking at 'the Music Lovers' today, the only real shock comes in the realisation that behind all the grotesquerie and frenzied headiness, there's actually a damned good film going on ~ and one that really shouldn't be taken so ludicrously seriously.Richard Chamberlain is great as potty old Peter and Glenda Jackson equal to him as his driven-loopy-by-sexual-frustration (and we've all been there !)  gold-digging spouse.The rest of the well-capable cast is from Russell's own personel stock: Aris, Gable, Telezynska, Faulds, Colley, Armitage, Claire with a special mention to Max Adrian - always magnificent for Russell - as Tchaikovsky's critical professor and one of the earliest cultural exponents of tough love.It's a well known fact that Russell only managed to secure finance for the picture after promising the keepers of the UA purses that he would completely sensationalise the story - and this he did...The British film industry was split three ways in the early seventies: Hammer horror was merrily stripping off in the wake of the relaxation in censorship, the bawdy Carry On films were also taking advantage, the euphemisms more shamelessly lavatorial than ever; and the 'worthy' 'art' film,  Loache's 'Kes' and Anderson's 'If' being recent - and brutal - examples, were operating embryonically effectively but still very much in the margins.Russell combines all three, as usual with not much subtelty and even less restraint. He lashes his spunky creativity to every frame,  exaggerating and mocking each genre until the droll mutation is irresistibly defined.'The Music Lovers' is hilarious, ugly, cruel, angry, beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. It's the kind of film that needed to be made in the UK in 1970, delivering a hefty swift one to the cobblers of all that had cinematically preceded it in the previous purple satin decade (even, to some extent, Russell's own work). It isn't by any leap, a hasty follow up to the courageously inferior 'Women in Love' ~ it's its own bellicose beast. A veritable black box of hysterical despair and lewd, clever, rip-roaring bleak humour.How factual it all is is open to debate (and debate, and debate...), this is obviously Tchaikovsky's story as Russell sees it - and, as has been observed elsewhere - it is a strange truth he sometimes sees. No-one should care. To paraphrase from another vulture of controversy hovering around at the time, 'The Music Lovers' is a 'man sized crast.' Who is bothered if he never actually met Madam von Meck, his adoring patron, or the men in white coats didn't come for his cuckoo missus til AFTER his death ?  Not this reviewer for chips.Enjoy it in 'Scope for the first time too; a film this size thrives on Panavision like the cholera bacteria thrives in fecal waste water. Yet even in it's eye-pleasing vastness, 'The Music Lovers' paints tiny cameos. Russell - like David Lynch - should be forced to film everything he does at 2:35, including his tv work. Great visualists (cinematicians I call them) have nothing to fear from the empty corners.Another reviewer claims 'The Music Lovers' to be the greatest British film ever made, and this may well be so. The proclamation seems wild, yet I can't think of many UK productions more important or so thunderously enjoyable. What the Puttnam/Forbes axis would make of that I really can't say, but I'd like to be in the studio audience of that Idle-presented, profoundly reverential tv show, when they, Russell and Melvyn Bragg (The Music Lovers excellent scriptwriter) thrash it all out.",N/A

1148503,"The packaging: very nice. It's organized very well, and the box is surprisingly durable. It's also a great space saver, as individual season box sets (1 - 8) would take up substantially more room than this all-in-one box set.My one criticism of the packaging is that, included is the script for the last episode, which is bound with little brass rivets. The rivets unfortunately have a tendency to catch on the lip of the box when removing it or putting it back in. Also, the accompanying episode guide has a brown paper ""cover protector"" (like on high school textbooks) and that cover also has a bad habit of catching on the lip of the box, creating little tears. But these are minor inconveniences, and as long as you remember them, you can remove the items carefully and prevent any damage from being done.I'm giving this 3 stars not because of the actual box set (which I was very impressed with) but because of the show itself. This show was a lot funnier when I was a teenager and I didn't yet understand all of the tired TV tropes that were used on this show - the token stupid foreigner, the token hot girl(s), etc. I loved the detail that was put in the show, especially how the sets were designed, and the guest stars they brought in (which were frequently 70's TV stars) was a great touch. I hate to say this, but it was the characters that spoiled the show for me; or rather, the main characters. Eric was too arrogant and treated everyone around him like some sort of servant; Michael was too stupid and slapstick to be likeable; Fez was less of a character and more just one long, racist joke; Jackie was just as annoying as Eric, but smaller in size; and Donna, like Fez, was less of a character and just one long, sexually-objectifying joke. Hyde was the only bearable character, and that's because he didn't have the requisite unbearably annoying personality ""quirk"" that every other character had. It was the supporting characters - the parents, basically - that were at all sympathetic as characters.So I feel torn on the show, as I love the premise, and I greatly admire the detail that went into the show, but I felt so little empathy for the main characters that it was difficult to really engage with the storylines.",N/A

He gained access to the Tsar-family because of his ability to ""heal"" the ""Tsarevich"": Alexei (son of Tsar Nicholas II). Rasputin was a big man so I can see why Christopher Lee is playing him. I personally enjoy cult-movies, and this movie has ""Cult"" written all over it. This movie is from 1966, but it is in color. It really has that 50s/60s-atmosphere to it.

She seemed to improve as a film actor in the last 15 years of her career, she was not at her best here. Using film acting technique more acceptable in the thirties. William Holden is so so miscast, twenty years too old for the role. A wonderful actor nonetheless, but it spoils the whole film that he is so old for the role that should be played by someone about 25 to 30.

It's one of my favorite DCA movies yet. It's right behind ""Batman: Under The Red Hood"" for me. I thought the animation complimented the graphic novel nicely, actually thought they improved on it.

Though my favorite Berlin show is the ill-fated much-maligned and to me at least glorious all-hits ""Mr. President"" - I also love the songs from ""Madam"".

I am not a fan of Donald O'Connor alas (I have the Merman/Dick Haymes recording of the tunes, and am a fan of Haymes - conscientious objector and all - only in America - or Germany!), but still think it's a great flick.  BTW the recently released TV production of ""Anything Goes"" without seeing it would NOT recommend for two reasons.  First, in a 50s TV production, I'm sure the title song is bowdlerized in the expectable ways (""now heaven knows"" and ""now only use three letter words"" - only in America - or China).  The other reason is Sinatra.  I won't have that guy in the house.  Even Porter, Lahr and Merman can't overcome my two objections.  And those objections must be very strong to overcome those three things!Tried a 2nd time to add a note.  How innocuously can I put this?

1378219,"I've been a major Star Wars Fan ever since the Fantom Menance appeared in theaters back in 20001, so you can imagine how excited I was to find out that these TV shows were coming out on Blue Ray!I'm someone that needs to have everything on the latest technology, so I've already thrown out my old DVDs, those are so 2010 anyway!, in anticipation for this release.I'm really glad that they decided to put Anakin Skywalker(Hans Christain Anderson), one of the most beloved of all Star Wars characters, for the cover of this release, instead of say, old characters from the 70s version of the show, like Luke Skywalker(Some old guy).If you read the title of my review, then you already know my next point. The older films have too little CGI special effects in them. Some of the scenes in these older episodes aren't even shot in front of a blue screen. There are some CGI special effects in the older ones that look really good, such as Yoda and when Gweedo(Thomas Haden Church) shot Han Solo(Indiana Jones). It is so awesome how Han deftly dodges that laser blast by moving his head to the side like a sassy black woman. Even so, the special effects are few and far between, even in this updated edition.Also, for some reason the episodes in this set are placed out of order, so the newer, better episodes are numbers 1 through 3, and the earlier, stupider, episodes are 4 - 6. I give them a break on this, because I think they wanted to put their best foot forward by putting the better episodes first, knowing that most people wouldn't' get around to watching the later ones anyway because by the time they make it to them there would already have been another Blue Ray DVD set out with better graphics.In case you are reading this review because you've never seen the Star Wars show and are interested in learning more about it, I can devote the rest of this review into catching you up. First, there's the cast of characters.Anakin Skywalker - Cool guy that starts out as a kid but turns into a Jedi Knight. (Think an actual knight only 100000x cooler). Falls in love with a hot chick and then turns into Dark Vader after killing her.Jar Jar Binks - Amazing space alien that does magic tricks. Saves the world by falling into a cannon in the first episode, but then becomes a senator and we don't see him as much.Princess Amaldala - hot chick.Luke Skywalker - guy from the earlier episodes.

1320700,"Part of After Dark Horrorfest 4, Kill Theory (2009) directed by Chris Moore, features a twisted variation of the kill or die scenario, when a group of friends is forced to turn on each other.  Once set in motion, events play out dramatically and violently, though not very credibly, as the characters demonstrate few critical thinking skills, and a fair amount of treachery.The instigator of the mayhem is a fellow named Walter (Kevin Gage) who to save his own life while mountain climbing, cut a rope that sent three of his friends to their deaths.  Tried and convicted of manslaughter, Walter spends several years in a mental institution, before being conditionally released.  Unfortunately Walter still has issues, and seeking closure, he sets in motion a deadly scheme.Seven friends gather at a home in the country, to celebrate their upcoming graduation from college.  Shortly after the group settles in for the night, Nicole (Steffi Wickens) is abducted while grabbing a snack.  Soon after, Nicole's dead body is hurled through a window, awakening everyone in the house.  Cut into the dead girl's belly, are the letters ""TV"".  The group, switches on the television, and view a video narrated by the killer.  It shows Nicole being urged to shoot her sleeping boyfriend, and then later having refused, they witness the killer slitting her throat.  Walter says that if more than one person is alive in the house at 6am, they will be killed.  If only one person is alive, then no harm will come to them.  For those in the house, the options are either all will die, or only one will survive the night.There is some panicking and a lot of loud discussion, however not a lot of rational behavior comes from it.  Cell phones don't work, and there is apparently no internet, so the group is on their own.  Anyone who leaves the house is apparently fair game, as the killer has traps planted at various locations, and also has a rifle.  The group attempts to escape in the only available vehicle, but the Killer disables it using another trap.  Paranoia grows stronger, as people start to die, and the Killer steps in to provide some additional motivation.  The survivors start to crack under pressure, and turn on each other in an overdramatic last act, that is terribly written and acted.  In the end, Walter does gain some closure, and the reason why the group was chosen for his experiment, is revealed.The film creates a situation, cranks up the pressure, tosses in a few weapons, and then some selfish unlikeable characters, destroy each other.  It doesn't plays out in a very credible way.  The Killer can't be everywhere, so if they had just split up and gone in different directions, the situation would have fallen apart, or at least more would probably have survived.  For whatever reason, the victims apparently believe that the Killer will actually keep his word, and spare the sole survivor.  Through this turns out to be the case, there is really no reason for that trust.The cast do a decent job with what they are given, but the screenplay doesn't do them any favors, having them behave like morons, who stab each other in the back for silly reasons.  Almost everything feels fake and stilted towards achieving the desired goal.  Starring Agnes Bruckner, Patrick Flueger, Ryanne Duzich, Teddy Dunn, Steffi Wickens, Daniel Franzese, and Theo Rossi, the film is worth a watch for the very curious, or those that prefer a slasher type flick with a downbeat ending.",N/A

1084044,"This is a small budget BBC film that explains the heart break of the Rwandan genocide as succinctly as possible when telling only one aspect. In the Uk it was released as `shooting dogs' as the UN were only allowed to shoot the dogs that had taken to eating the corpses of the victims, the Un were not allowed to use their firearms to defend the victims. One of a catalogue of disasters that added up to the 1994 genocide.The film stars John Hurt as a Priest based in a UN school where new teacher (Hugh Dancey) is building up a positive reputation and has a star pupil who he wants to encourage. When the fighting breaks out they are convinced that the UN will protect everyone in the school and those who flock to them for protection. However, as anyone who knows anything about this tragic affair, the UN not only pulled out but only offered succour to Europeans; actually it was only French and Belgians at first.The priest and the teacher face the dilemma of staying with their charges or escaping with their lives and both choose different courses of action both with life changing consequences.Shot on actual location and actually featuring some of the actual survivore4 as both cast and crew and deals not only with the Rwandan genocide but asks us to examine how we would react when faced with evil of such magnitude.

1326858,"I'm writing this review in response to Lotte's review of the dvd, ""Scruples.""  I was appalled when I read the review, thinking that Lotte had mis-judged the series.  I do not own ""Scruples"" on dvd yet.  But I do have the original VHS copy, and I also have a personal copy of my own which I had watched so many times until the product became worn.  Lotte, I really do believe you've over-looked something fundamental when viewing the dvd. ""Scruples"" has always been a superb piece of '80's drama, and having Lindsay Wagner at the helm of the production vehicle was a superb choice.  I have always regarded her as the quinessential queen of the '80's mini-series.  And I only wish the television moguls would re-consider bringing back the mini-series before reality t.v. completely takes over the spectrum.Lotte, please give the dvd another once-over.  I'm sure there are some things you've missed.  Or maybe you were viewing on a bad day. ""Scruples"" is an excellent choice of material and a pertinent display of dramatic caliber that should still be apart of your movie collection.A Dedicated Movie Lover",Scruples

The story centers around the students and teacher at a small school in a remote Japanese coastal town.  The viewer watches as the story progresses and the children grow and pursue their futures.  The film begins with the years before WW2 and continues into the years afterwards.This is a touching story, and one that is well told.  The actors are very good, especially surprising since many are children.  The settings are very beautiful and only add to the overall evocative feeling of the film.  I highly recommend this film, it is surely among the best ever filmed in Japan.",Twenty-Four Eyes
1378357,"I read lots of mixed reviews on this DVD. Most seemed to slam Megadeth and praise Anthrax and Metallica so I wasn't sure what to expect but I figured considering the price of the DVD and 4 bands, there's gonna be somewhere I'll get my money's worth?In some cases, negative reviews come from the fans themselves complaining about two songs they thought should have been played but didn't or a drum solo in the middle, a medley or whatever.Well, we've watched this video 9 times and here's the verdict and out of all four bands, I favor no one band over another so this is completely un-biased.Overall, this DVD won't disappoint. It's very entertaining. The lighting and camera work are first rate.I'm going to assume each band was given the opportunity in the final mix of the music because every band sounds different.Anthrax and Megadeth had the most balanced sound. Slayer was very thin and sounded awful and Lars wanted to make sure the world heard his awful (and off time) drumming loud and clear over the rest of the band in Metallica's set.Vocals - I think all the singers struggled... I'd give the nod to Mustaine out of the 4 and I've never been a Mustaine fan.Overall performance - Megadeth hand's down ACED it... Anthrax had a very tight set too. Metallica at times had difficulty keeping time and James struggled with the vocals. Slayer's performance itself was good but was overshadowed by poor sound and an aged singer.James Hetfield made a good point towards the end of the video. He said, ""we've been around almost 30 years"" and he's right. These guys aren't 20 year old kids anymore and at some points it shows.I'd suggest buying this video, I think there's something in it that could entertain everybody... Enjoy!",N/A

1357425,"3-D has taken the theaters by storm this past year. So much so that everything but the kitchen sink has been tossed at audiences (and I'm not certain that even that hasn't been thrown). Greek Gods to zombies have found there way to the format so is it any wonder that a horror series jumped on board? SAW 3D THE FINAL CHAPTER supplies that need.Fans of the film series have loved every gruesome, gory scene offered. But now they had the chance to witness it in 3D in theaters. But with the movie being released on DVD in regular 2D format is it a good movie? Without the comin' at ya type effects, is it any good? The answer is yes and no.If you've been following the series at all you know that the film began with 2 people chained in a run down old subway type bathroom being provided knowledge of how they had wronged people and given a chance to make a choice, one that would involve some great pain or damage, but that would give them the chance to make write their wrongs.The series continued in this vein with the main character of Jigsaw, the culprit who was behind the dangerous torture fueled traps that held each person captive, who in reality was John Kramer (Tobin Bell). It seems that John was diagnosed with an inoperable condition and then treated poorly by everyone from insurance agents to police. With nothing to lose, he set out to help people change their lives, giving them an opportunity to become valued members of society or perish in the process. Talk about tough love.By the time this film opens, John's last assistant has gone on a rampage and disgraced the original intent that John began with. Sure it was crazy, but Det. Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) has taken it into a whole different direction. As seen in the last film, rather than truly offering people a chance to change, he's set out on making the traps inescapable. Instead of a chance it is now out and out murder.It appeared that he was facing death at the hands of John's wife (Betsy Russell) in the last film, but he escaped and is now searching for her as well as setting up a whole new game for Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flannery). It seems that Dagen claimed to be on of Jigsaw's victims, profiting from writing a book about his experience and going on to creating self help groups for other victims as well as a DVD of their meetings.Now Bobby must face Jigsaw for real in the form of Hoffman. And with each new trap we are witness to another form of torture that has the potential to end gruesomely and with much blood spilled. While not quite out and out torture porn, as this genre has been named, the film does have the viewer bear witness to some truly gut wrenching deaths. Perhaps not if you've seen the other films, but anyone just now jumping on may turn their head more often than once.As Hoffman pursues John's wife and sets in motion Bobby's trial by fire, the police are hot on his trail. Tracking him through the clues left behind, they narrow it down. But will the get there in time to prevent another death forever linked to Jigsaw?One thing the movie does offer is the chance for it to truly end. And the surprise ending here was one that caught me off guard and was actually quite satisfying. But it did offer the slightest chance for the series to continue. One can only hope that the makers of this series let it go out on a high note rather than milk it for one last dollar. I mean does anyone really feel the need to pull out JASON GOES TO MANHATTAN? Six films in a series that has only one (in my opinion) truly bad film is something to take pride in.So if you're a fan you'll love this one. If you've come and gone, you'll get a decent solution to the story. The lose ends are tied up nicely by the last minute. The series has a beginning, middle and an end. And the ending offered is satisfactory.",Saw: The Final Chapter

The general plot - a typical modern-day family juggling the pressures and challenges of everyday life, while adding a cranky grandfather riddled with health problems to the mix - also sounded promising. But overall, the movie was just plain depressing, and certainly didn't qualify as having any ""comedy,"" as the DVD jacket claimed. Despite being family members under one roof, everyone from the spouses to the two teen sons seemed to be living separate lives that didn't connect with one another at all, which is often true to life; but in a movie, their stories should intertwine somehow, and they really just didn't.

1130185,"Other reviewers are absolutely correct when they say this flick has nothing to do with any of the George Romero movies, and it's not exactly honest to use the name of one of those films to further along this steaming pile of crap. The only things in common are the names of some of the characters like Captain Rhodes and the idea that the military working with the scientists against the zombies while having been used by our government theme, yeah okay - been there, done that how many times now?Acting? It's OK. Nothing special. No one walked away with any awards fr their parts played.Special effects? Variable; some are good, some are not so good.

108277,"If only law enforcement could actually handle a detective like Gino, my God this world would truly be a safe and secure place. (I'll wallow in my fantasy dreams later, but for now understand this)The 80's and 90's brought us action aficionados just what we wanted: Real men with real purposes; Real firepower with real edge; Real villains with real persuasion; but most importantly, great entertainment and everlasting memories.  I am happy to say that my first exposure to a Steven Seagal film was this true masterpiece (well, in my humble opinion) Out for Justice. It is important to remind you that my expectations for this film were severely hyped and inflated by a friend but he eventually stopped talking and let Seagal do the talking instead, or more plainly spoken, let the wreckage and destruction begin.The plot couldn't be more simple than a true and false question:Gino (Seagal) is an NYPD detective from Brooklyn who does not, and I repeat does not hesitate for a split second; he is simply instinct, and my oh my does he have a beautiful and charismatic way of expressing it. After Gino's close partner friend, Bobby Lupo, (The name is poetic to my ears) is killed in public by a crazed and unbalanced lunatic Richie (William Forsythe) things get a little personal to say the very least.Gino is not only out for justice now, but  is out for just about anybody that subsequently impedes his path to finding and killing Richie (Even the mob). Richie was the childhood enemy that everyone in Brooklyn couldn't stand, but now there's a bigger problem. Richie is still unlikable as ever and now he has developed a crack/cocaine addiction that is only exacerbating his already unstable mentality. Unfortunately for Richie, Segeal is not the only one after his blood, but the Italian mob is too after Bobby's blood was shed in front of a mob owned restaurant.  I think it is appropriate to leave up to the rest of one's curious imagination what exactly happens to Richie and how far his addiction takes him.Within the first 5 minutes of the film actions fans will be cordially welcomed to find out how well taken care of they are when Seagal goes toe to toe with a pimp whose outfit is just as bad as his small and puny frame. Without getting into too much detail and most importantly, without over hyping this scene, this is probably one of the greatest introductions I have ever appreciated in action history; moreover, it is highly masculine and testosterone driven that comes off very raw too in some ways. On a different note, I feel as though the film's true nature and dark tone is exposed in greater depth when Richie randomly kills a woman after she honks her horn at him to move out of the way. Richie's incredibly unbalanced character along with his zero empathy for life is quite unsettling. His edginess and sheer lack of compassion is enough to send one to grip their seat as even Richie's accomplices have difficult coping with his drug induced psychotic nature . The dark music score by David Michael Frank only reinforces Riche's exceedingly perilous killing spree and not to mention adds a very nice touch to the theme.Thankfully, Gino understands crime and the nature of Richie all too well and couldn't possibly express this emotion more accurately in the way he handles and ultimately eliminates criminal trash. Seagal for lack of a better term, is utterly relentless in this film. Gino's firepower and disregard for danger is fueled by revenge and this revenge leads him to the final showdown against Richie that is impossible to forget because it is so choreographed to perfection. Seagal is simply as ruthless as Richie's addiction. Gino's natural fuel of persistent revenge is absolutely no match for Riche's artificial and short lived cocaine high. This is only reaffirmed when Gino admonishes Richie that it's a shame that he is all out of bullets because "" those bullets could of saved him a lot of pain"", and boy was Gino not exaggerating with those words.Enjoy.",N/A

I gave this 4 out of five (the one fatal flaw, as others had mentioned earlier, racial stereotypes in some of the very early shorts), but generally very hillarious. Among my personal favorite Rascal/Gang shorts, 1932's ""Free Wheeling"" when Stymie drives fellow rascals around in a cart, mule breaks lose, cart ends up rollind down Southern California roadway...and of course that's when all hell breaks loose. Another one is ""Lucky Corner"" when they parade, try to sell lemon aid (a bully steals it), then Spanky & Alfalfa plant some electrical devise in the bully's pants & the bully jumps, winces & squirms all over the place. I also like ""Divot Diggers"" where the kids are caddies for some golfers from 1936-the cause havok on the golf course as well (note Darla fast picking dandilions or flowers as the kids are on some flat board as they slide down the hill) right around the same time 3 Stooges did a short ""Three Little Beers"" where Moe, Larry & Curly creat havok on a golf course as well. Darla Hood & Spanky Mcfarland were always my favorite rascals with Alfalfa Switzer, Buckwheat Thomas, Stymie Beard not too far behind. These are the Roach shorts. I own several of the early MGM shorts--the first dozen or two of the MGM shorts were not bad, but I simply refuse to watch the later ones where too many of the classy original rascals left, replaced by Janet or Frogy, pretty much the same way I feel that the Stooges were right on the mark 80% of the time,with Moe, Larry, Curly or Shemp-but I refuse to watch the Joe Besser ones.

And I was much impressed.  But  I love this version of the Ballet, with some reservations, as noted below.  I'm a fan of Tamara Rojo and Carlos Acosta ((see them in Romeo and Juliet and in Manon with the Royal Opera Ballet (Wow!) I was hoping to see how Tamara and Acosta (and Marianela Nunez) stacked up to Svetlana and Roberto, and Marianela to Darcy Bussell in the latter's superb performance in the  older Royal Opera performance.  Well, I loved Tamara and Marianela.  I thought both were superb dancers and actors who knew how to use mime to supplement their dancing skills.  I was disappointed with Carlos.  I felt he was doing the steps, but that's all.  He lacked emotion.  Fortunately Tamara and Marianela supplied that important ingredient. I found the Shades sequence entrancing - yet not as good as that in the Paris Opera Nureyev version. Comparisons are always odious.  Yet I had to make some here. But I'm not knocking the Corps de Ballet.  Those girls really danced up a well orchestrated storm in all their routines.  Too bad Carlos was out to lunch when they did their stuff.  He could have learned something from the way they demonstrated emotion even within their regimented ranks.

He shines in this as he did in the film TAI CHI 2. This is a great martial artist and actor - and you'll die of ennui before you'll ever find anything worthwhile about him on the web. Even the Internet Movie Database has a paltry sliver of an entry about Yu Hai. (In spite of playing the abbot in 2011's SHAOLIN, it is still billed as a Jackie Chan film. In all fairness, SHAOLIN is also a Yu Hai film!)At around 3 hours, this is really pure Chinese fun. When they do that in China, they do it right. While it has sagging moments, this is as great as it gets. The cast here is extravagant and the production values are better than many major Chinese theatrical films. Jacky Wu is charming and dazzling as a martial artist.Thankfully, very few crummy sets plague this film: much of it is shot outside and to great effect. While one sees the occasional crummy old-school Chinese acting here, it is a must-see for all enthusiasts. The quality of the martial arts is more stunning than most films show us. One warning: titles and plotlines can get extremely confusing, because a film with this generic storyline is made about every decade or so - I've seen two really old versions and then there's Jet Li.THIS great piece is the only Tai Chi television drama series that has been released on DVD.This, however, is a landmark treat, a real treasure for anyone wanting some long-term commitment entertainment - and some serious martial arts.",Tai Chi Master
1493123,"*Episode Spoilers*I love this episode through and through: the danger lurking in every corner, the eeriness of the deserted landscape, the road-block and the cars, the herds of zombies. The imminent danger and terror were palpable at every moment, perfectly conveying that mood of terror and desolation. The herd scene was very intense and almost difficult to watch as i felt so drawn it, it was like i was there with them, being scared to death that one of the walkers might bend down, see them and take a bite. It was pure terror. I like how the episodes (Season 1 until now) go from delightfully scary to unexpectedly terrifying about half-way through. The scene where Andrea is still in the RV playing with her gun when the walkers are right outside and the little delay until she discovers them but it is too late and she is trapped inside: perfection. So intense. I was dying watching her locked up in the small restroom and the walker right outside. If only all episodes in this season were like that.What did bother me was all the men deciding that the little women shouldnt get any guns in a world overrun by zombies and where a walker seems to be waiting at every turn. That was ridiculous and pretty sexist and short sighted. I also couldnt believe that the kids were allowed to just roam around as they pleased and how Carl was allowed to go on the search for Sophia; in fact that entire scene where he asks for permission and Lori gets all ""cutsie"" about it  - as if she was debating whether she should let him go camping tonight and not as if she was juts about ot send her 10 year old into the woods filled with zombies - seemed ridiculous.I did like how Andrea eventually confronted Dale and accused him of having taken away her choice to die on her terms as opposed to being torn apart by drooling freaks. I had never thought about it that way but given their predicament it did make sense and as the audience it does make you wonder what you would choose if the world had come to an end and being scared and the race to stay alive where the only things to live for. Suddenly Dale stopped looking like a hero who saved her life. It was acted very believably because you see that moment of epiphany in Dale's face where it occurs to him for the first time that what he did wasnt selfless deserving gratitude, but in fact quite selfish. That is the kind of strong dialog and exchange I expect to see throughout this season.Altogether I think this was one bada$$ episode from start to finish and I am so disappointed that the subsequent episodes of this season have failed in that regard and that we have gone essentially from a fantastic season premiere filled with all the amazing elements that made Season 1 excel to one that looks like an empty balloon you let all the air out of and that is sort of just sitting around deflated. This is how I see the subsequent episodes anyway - especially compared to Season 1 and the Season 2 premiere.  Bring Darabont back and fire the new writers who seem to be coming from the daytime soap genre.",N/A

949552,"Be prepared to pay for your sins when you enter THE CONFESSIONAL! Cult British Horror director Pete Walker uses the film to take a penetrating look into religion, particularly in the archaic practices of the Catholic church. Father Xavier Meldrum uses his confessional booth to spy on his parish, using the tapes he collects to blackmail the members of his church and coerce them into doing whatever he likes. Young Jenny becomes the object of his obsession, and when blackmail fails to bring them together, he tries the next best thing: murder! The priest claims to be cleansing his flock by forcing their sins out into the open, where he threatens to expose their adultery, premarital sex, and abortions to their friends and families. The more modern Father Cutler frequently tries to convince Meldrum of the church's outdated practices, but Meldrum is locked in his ways, and accuses Cutler of allowing their members to fall into temptation. These impacted questions of morality are as relevant today as they were in 1976 upon the film's release, allowing THE CONFESSIONAL an added significance and deeper meaning than the average exploitative shocker of its kind. Walker's key lighting creates an ominous mood in the church setting, where a great number of the unexpectedly brutal and bloody murders take place. Although its pace often suffers, the performances by Anthony Sharp, Stephanie Beacham, Norman Eshley, and the great Sheila Keith hold the audience's attention throughout the slower exposition. This is one of Walker's better films, falling somewhere between HOUSE OF WHIPCORD and FRIGHTMARE in quality and style.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",The Confessional: House of Mortal Sin

Some boyhood-surrealist themes work ---- CINEMA PARADISO-- but with those you know you are watching surrealism;  Butcher Boy never establishes its genre.I also am uncomfortable with the movie's un-judged acceptance of a boy ""hero"" whose response to a father's brutality is to adore the father and glibly rechannel his true feelings into brutally murdering another woman --- hello?

118152,"I purchased this film because of the rave notices it received here and because I've never seen it before.  Unfortunately, I was more than a little disappointed that, from my point of view, it turned out to be just adequate.  I've seen far better war movies that I've obviously kept due to their value as films I can watch multiple times without tiring of them.  The only thing I found of interest in this film was the terrific job by several actors that later went on to play iconic TV characters (most notably, George Tobias/Abner Kravitz on Bewitched & Hugh Beaumont as the Beaver's dad), plus the always dependable Henry Hull.  And of course, that harrowing nighttime battle towards the end (of an 142 minute movie!) was worth the viewing.  Other than that, most of the film involves a long hike through muck and mire (a joke used in the film by George Tobias).  It was interesting to note that the film was initially banned in the United Kingdom due to grandstanding by the Americans, who apparently had little to do with this particular campaign but were more than willing to take all the credit for it (at least on film).  Considering this movie was made during a time of war and was obviously used as a means of recruiting, that charge might be excused.I am not sorry I got the chance to see it at least once, but I don't ever want to watch it again.",N/A
1389712,"What is it about Zomebies that makes them so appealing nowadays? As one that loves the classic monster movies, Zombies are the new kids on the block. They became a hit with the cult-classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" back in 1968. Back then, Zombies were reanimated dead people that had an insatiable craving for human brains. They were slow fumbling ""simple"" folk. As other people made Zombie movies, each writer, director, and producer added their own twists on what it was to be one of the undead. Of crouse the biggest inside joke was that in all the movies, they are never called ""Zombies"".Today, Zombies have a cool factor about them. They have even starred in extremely hilarious cult movies such as Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, and Fido. Now the cable channel AMC has brought back an entirely new Zombie story and for the first time, they are at the heart of an episodic television show. The first season of ""The Walking Dead"" was truly landmark TV and something TV viewers are so desperate to have. It's unique, compelling, and highly entertaining. My only lament is that the first season was only six episodes long.So what makes it so special? Well for one, like all good science fiction, it's about the human condition and our society set in a fantastic fictional setting. A sheriff is shot in action and slips into a coma. When he wakes up, the hospital has become a wild abandoned haunted house with things that go bump in the night locked behind chained doors. When he gets up and gets out, he discovers his home town almost deserted. He makss a bee line to his home where he discovers his wife and son have packed up thier most precious belongings and fled, He then meets a man and his son that have been surviving the ""zombie-pocolypse"" that bring him up to speed on what's gone on. There has been a deadly virus that once it kills you, it reanimates your body into a mindless flesh-eater. The rumor has it a lot of people have fled to nearby Atlanta for sanctuary, so our Sheriff goes to his local precinct, loads up for bear, and heads for Atlanta. Once there, he meets up with a reg-tag band of survivors and this is where the great dynamic begins.The survivors are a cross-section of Americana, complete with all its flaws. The only thing they have in common is that they want to survive. This is what makes Walking Dead stand out amoung all the other zombie stories. It reminds me of what I thought made the recent version of Battlestar Galactica so great. Its not about the Zombies, its about the human condition. The Zombies are there to present an on-going crisis that compells tha central characters on to confront their frailties and issues. The stories and scripts are so well written, I am going to be quite upset if this off-beat show is not nominated for an Emmy for its writing.Also, it's writers are not afraid to take risks and just like Battlestar, everyone is at risk. People die and they have made it quite clear that no one, even its central characters, are safe from death or zombification. Another thing I quite liked is that so much was packed into these six episodes, it seems like a series that had twice the number of episodes. The pacing is extrordinary and while it's never overpwoering, it moves at a brisk pace. Also, when the last scenes have played out in the final episode of the season, it is a great ending that not only leaves the door open for Season 2, but it clears the slate so that anything can happen.This is must-see TV and I highly reccommend anyone that can get past the concept of Zombies to watch this series. I can not wait until Seaosn 2 airs.",N/A

1395191,"I have to say that when I first heard about the concept of Cowboys and Aliens I laughed out loud.  It sounded like fun - like Blazing Saddles meets Space Balls - and I'd have loved to see a serious satire about aliens invading the old West.  Then I read they meant to keep it serious, like maybe True Grit meets Predator.  That sounded good, too.  After all, if there really were aliens  who had the capacity to come to Earth it makes sense that they wouldn't just visit L.A. in the present.  Why wouldn't they show up in medieval Europe, or even the wild West?  I'd love to see what the man with no name does with a xenomorph.  I really liked what Favreau did with Iron Man, and liked the Star Trek reboot by the writers of this show, so I ended up deciding to check this out when it played in our local theater.It turns out, though, the film didn't live up either to its initial hilarity or the subsequent promise of a serious Western in which the townsfolk are abducted by aliens.  They should have gone for funny, because my wife and I laughed out loud as the film hit clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.  I believe it's supposed to be loosely adapted from a graphic novel, but it felt like the writers decided to watch a bunch of Westerns and sci-fi flicks and then tried to come up with a plot that would give them a chance to hit them all.  The nameless drifter with a criminal past, the apparent prostitute with a heart of gold, the manipulative cattle boss and his psychopathic son, the native Americans with their wisdom rituals, the toothless bandits, the familial reconciliation, the ride off into the sunset...and then why is it that after Alien every sentient being from outer space has an outer shell that opens up to reveal internal mouths and other body parts?They hired decent actors and then gave them lines that were laughable.  They tried to sell Harrison Ford as a greedy and vicious man, who had the whole town under his thumb - in a role reversal of the type that worked brilliantly when Sergio Leone cast Henry Ford as the cruel force of evil in Once Upon a Time in the West.  It didn't work here - both because I didn't find Ford convincing as a bad guy and because the writers chickened out and let him turn out to have a soft side.  They ended up explaining why Olivia Wilde seemed so implausibly awestruck by the sight of Daniel Craig - but even when it was clear who she was her story didn't make sense.  Without revealing anything specific I'll just say it's utterly implausible that, being who she said she was, she'd be there just waiting for the coincidence that Daniel Craig's character happened to have the knowledge and the power that she'd travelled so far to find.  That's just one among many loose ends in the story.  I have a lot of patience, but I found the first half of the film to be overly boring and long.  Eventually it had a few thrilling moments - they didn't entirely waste their special effects budget - and that's why I'm giving it two stars, since if you were distracted and bored at home there might be worse things to do than waste time watching this one.",Cowboys & Aliens

Although I didn't enjoy this film as much as I didThe Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray] andThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre [Blu-ray] it was a joy to see just how well this blu-ray version has been restored as the picture quality although not pristine perfect is still very good and the only gripe I have with this release is the relatively poor audio quality.  They missed the opportunity to do a DTS HD MA 5.1 Surround Sound like the excellentAll About Eve [Blu-ray Book] leaving us with a pretty lame Dolby Digital Mono which didn't really cut it.  Disappointing really but at least the picture quality is a lot better than the sound and the shots of the wildlife in Africa in Technicolor was a real treat.

They don't have any fear, don't have any comprehension of the worries that plague us all when we travel, or go out alone at night. In Jumper, there's a new category of world traveler: the superhero.Jumpers, you see, are teleporters.  They can teleport anywhere they've seen and they leave jumpscars - dimensional portals - open for a minute or so after they jump.  If you're fast, you can jump in after them.That's all you need to know about Jumper, and that's all Jumper is going to share with you.  There are no details behind teleportation (hint: according to modern scientific theory, if you can teleport you can time travel). Filling the role of villain is a shadowy government agency known as Paladins who have figured out how to anchor Jumpers by lassoing them with electrified nets.  They believe that Jumpers are a threat to mankind and see the ability to jump as religious blasphemy - kind of unnecessary, really, as you can imagine that any government agency would be plenty terrified of Jumpers without all the Biblical angst.But anyway, that's the premise of Jumper: boy meets girl, boy learns to teleport, government agency tries to kill boy, boy meets girl again, repeat until somebody dies.  Only nobody dies.Jumper has to be the most attractively hollow movie I've seen in a while.  Nothing is resolved. Good guy David Rice (Hayden Christensen, broodingly bland as ever) doesn't ever really learn his lesson, Paladin-hunter Griffin (the far more interesting Jamie Bell) is left in limbo, love interest Millie (also bland Rachel Bilson) doesn't deal with the consequences of a romance with a Jumper, and even archvillain Roland (Samuel L. Jackson with crazy white hair) isn't permanently defeated.  The big reveal about Rice's past has no impact on the plot at all since it's revealed in the last five minutes of the film.And that's a shame.  Jumpers are weird folks.  They don't need to worry about money, or responsibility, or fear of death.  They just jump away to some other place.  Do that enough and you start to get a little weird.  A relationship for a Jumper has to be quite strange, especially with someone who can't jump - I imagine Jumpers regularly order food and never pay for it, steal clothes and just walk out of the store, and travel all over the globe at a whim...but there only hints of any of this in Jumper.

The premise of four people staying overnight in a house that is notorious for its debauched past and may still be inhabited by nasty spirits is a good one with plenty of possibilities, and the movie makes the most of it.The movie was reasonably faithful to the book (unlike the movie treatment of another Matheson classic, ""I am Legend"").

The puzzle's solution hinges on some ludicrous coincidences, but the surprise is emotional enough that it doesn't matter. The civil war flashbacks have a curiously intimate feel; the director wisely focuses on scenes of brutal aftermath rather than full-scale battles.

We only see so little of Julia Roberts, her fans should take a pass.Personally, I'm not a fan of Tom Hanks -- I'm tired of his good-guy persona. But this was on a weekend special, and I'd heard it was pretty good. It isn't -- certainly nowhere near a 4-star.It's so boring that I wanted to turn it off. Since I ""paid"" for the movie, I decided to see it through. It isn't worth even $1.99, maybe 99 cents.",Larry Crowne

100466,"This movie will never enter my DVD/Blu-ray collection, this and Batman Forever. I either have, or will soon have every Batman movie, TV show, serial, live-action and animated that has been released on DVD. I love Batman, and I don't even love all of these movies and shows, the 60s show was kind of stupid, I don't much care for ""The Batman"", and the Burton films are just alright to me. But all of them had respect for the source material. Even Forever had more respect than this piece of garbage. But still, the dignity of the Batman franchise destroyed notwithstanding, even to the casual moviegoer, this is just a terrible movie, it's all over the place, the acting is terrible, and well, I can't say much else but that it is just godawful. I wouldn't stand to see this with my DVDs. Even if for some reason if I ever get Foerever, I will not have this, for where Forever is a crappy movie, not worthy of a spot between Returns and the animated series, this is an insult to everything that Batman is.

He decides to live live like a white man after inheriting a boarding house from a white man who took him in while he lived in both worlds growing up on San Carlos reservation and getting some education in the white man's world. In addition, he knows the day of the Apache Indian is quickly coming to an end as he knew and believed in.The supporting cast is really good, especially Richard Boone playing the tough bad guy as well as anyone could play it. The cast takes a ride on a stagecoach that is carrying an Indian agent and his wife that have been stealing from the San Carlos reservation and Boone and his band of outlaws realize the coach is carrying the cash and this is where the story kicks into the another level where the people show the dark sides of human nature. Newman knows people well enough that he takes the low, middle, and high road in the the movie. I love Newman's role all the way through the movie.This is a dark western and viewers should realize that things don't always turn out the way they want or should.A great, gritty, tough, and intelligent western.",N/A

1452752,"Vietnam is my generation's war. It is hard to comprehend the young kids shooting the video presented in this DVD are now, like me, in their sixties. This DVD is not an in depth study of the war. It does not get into the reasons why this country became both mired in it, and torn apart by it. The Gulf of Tonkin is mentioned as the first step toward increasing  U.S. involvement, but it does not discuss the controversy regarding legitimacy of the Tonkin incident. It doesn't mention Mai Lai, nor does it spend a lot of time discussing the reasons why the American public turned against the war. It is not meant to. This is the recollections of the young Americans who were on the ground, a nurse who served there and a P.O.W.'s wife. It does a great job of describing all the different hard fought engagements with the NVA, and the horror of it all. Many who went to Vietnam were volunteers,but many were draftees with no say in the matter. These young men served without caring about the politics of the time. They went, did what they were told to do, and just tried to stay alive. All Vietnam Vets who served risked their lives, and should be honored for the sacrifices they made. Some just wanted to survive and get home. Others returned home to join those speaking out against U.S. involvement. All were patriotic Americans, and hearing their personal stories put a human face on this war. For those who were interested in this DVD and/or the history of the Vietnam War, I recommend the exceptional PBS Documentary, ""Two Days in October"". Remembering my friend, John. Deployed in August of 1967, and killed in Kontum Province, March of 1968. 19 years old.",N/A

1307210,"From the opening scene to the credits, ""Machete"" was violent, gritty and action packed. What I will say is that you will either love this movie, or hate it. I am one of those that LOVED it. Ok, you should also know that I appreciate Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), Charlie Huston (Author of Hank Thompson series), Wayne Kramer (Running Scared) and Troy Duffy (Boondock Saints). I enjoy the crime noir or pulp noir genre of crime dramas because they tend to generate heated debates and discussions. No matter how you classify them, or what side you fall on (the love or the hate side), these sort of movies produce strong feelings...either negative or positive, and I think that is what most writers and producers hope for. There were some pretty controversial issues woven throughout the story.....vigilantism, immigration, drug abuse, sex, and violence....all of which set the stage for some pretty extraordinary events.  Although the subject matter and the dialog may seem on the surface to be in poor taste and offensive, I viewed it as a vehicle to tell the story, and a very entertaining story at that.Synopsis:Day laborer Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) has been approached and hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to shoot Senator McLaughlin (Robert Deniro). This assassination attempt was meant to endear voters to the Senator who is running on a ""strict regulations against illegal immigrants"" platform. What's better than a fallen hero?  Anyway, what Booth does not realize is that Machete's past is a little more complicated than he initially realized. Machete is an ex-Federale (Special Agent) who was presumed dead after being shot in the head following a case that went terribly wrong, and even resulted in his wife being beheaded. Now living the simple life as a day laborer, Machete is associated with some very unique characters, among them Luz, a vigilante/activist whose main goal is to help those who truly need rescuing while running a taco truck. Unbeknownst to them both, they are being watched by the very tenacious, ICE Agent Santana Rivera (played by Jessica Alba) who wants to prove herself and bring in the bad guy(s). Meanwhile, Booth is restless and has his own agenda, not to mention a very unstable drug dependant daughter, April (played by Lindsay Lohan) who he has some very impure thoughts about. To complicate matters, Booth also has a relationship with Von Jackson (Don Johnson) an eager border enforcer; and Drug Lord Torrez (played by Steve Seagal), none of which will result in anything positive. Even Machete's brother, Padre Cortez (Cheech Marin) isn't immune to what is going on and finds himself in a precarious position. As the violence escalates and the story unfolds, you see an underworld that contains gun totting nurses, a patch wearing Rodriquez, hired assassins, and dirty politicians, not to mention seeing the knife wielding Machete kill several dozen people who stand in the way of vengeance or justice.So before passing judgment on the movie, I suggest you just give it a chance. Challenge yourself to look beyond the stereotypes, violence and other things that on the surface are disturbing, and take it for what it is....a story about wrongs being made right, and good overcoming evil. I highly recommend this movie, and think most will enjoy it.",N/A

1346092,"""Unthinkable"" presents a difficutl situation; what morals and ethics are we willing to violate to find save millions of lives?When a homegrown terrorist Steven Younger (Michael Sheen)who has converted to Islam the FBI brings in a Black Ops interrogator known as ""H""(Samuel L. Jackson)used by the CIA to help FBI Agent Brody(Carrie Anne-Moss)determine whether or not the three nuclear bombs that Younger claims to have planted in U.S. cities are real. ""H"" will stop at nothing to get the information that he has been charged to pull out of Younger and while Brody recognizes the importance of finding and deactivating the bombs she doesn't believe that torture will give them the truth much less the location of the bombs in time.The movie which didn't receive a theatrical release (due to one of the production companies going under)is a psychological thriller that brings up a lot of important moral questions on the war on terror. The performances are stellar throughout with British born Sheen giving a brilliant, tortured (pardon the pun)performance as the zealot Younger. Equally as powerful are Jackson and Moss who often go toe-to-toe during their scenes. Written by actor/writer Peter Woodward (as an actor ""Crusade"", ""Babylon 5: A Call to Arms"" and as a writer ""Closing the Ring"" and ""The House of Angelo"")and directed by Gregor Jordan (""Ned Kelly"" and ""The Informers"") the film remains taunt even though most of the action happens at one location.The Blu-ray looks extremely good with a sharp looking transfer. There's just enough grain evident to make remind us that this was shot on film. Colors are a bit muted but that compliments the sense of ""reality"" of the film.The Blu-ray has an optional alternate version with a slightly different ending that was shot at the insistence of the production company because preview audiences felt dissatisfied about a question that was raised in the film by ""H"" (they shouldn't have--the original ending works much better and is much more logical if a bit less unsettling)as well a a commentary track by the director. Jordan gives us a lot of detail about how he and writer Woodward strived to stay as realistic as possible and not violate the premise of the film as well as his decisions for camera placement and various shots chosen for the film.We also get trailers as well as Sony IQ interactive fucntionality and Blu-ray Live connectivity.A powerful film that raises far more questions than providing answers (I don't think THAT'S the point of the film though--it's to raise these issues within the context of a thriller), ""Unthinkable"" features complex characters and thoughtful performances.Recommended.",N/A
1386100,"I have a couple of confessions to make. First, I was not even aware of ""Dark Skies"" when it aired on NBC in 1996-97 because my rabbit-ear antenna did not pick up the channel (it still doesn't, but that's another story), so the series was completely new to me. Second, I am writing this review without having watched all of the episodes!If another reviewer were to admit to not watching a DVD set such as this one before writing a review, I would jump all over him or her (""How can you possibly review something you haven't even seen???""). So be it--guilty as charged. But I now relax my own hard-and-fast rule for one simple reason: ""Dark Skies"" is so darned good that I just couldn't wait to post a review and hopefully encourage others who may be unfamiliar with the series to give it a try.The positive reviews posted here made me as anxious to pick up this set as any release in recent memory. The series' concept--a ""shadow"" organization fights an ongoing alien invasion in strictest secrecy--is fascinating. I especially look forward to seeing the threads of various themes of UFO conspiracy theories, such as alien abductions, crop circles, cattle mutilations, Roswell, MJ-12, etc., weave together against a background of actual historical events and people during the 1960s. I love the idea, and the quality of the execution in what I've seen so far completely blew me away. Having experienced just a part of the story, I'm ready to say that this is one of the best television series I've ever seen, and it will definitely bear watching again and again. It's a real shame that it didn't last longer than its brief run.You don't have to be a UFO believer (I'm not--you'd be hard pressed to find someone more skeptical of ""extraterrestrial visitors"" than I am) to really enjoy ""Dark Skies.""

Of all the dinner parties and gatherings I've attended in a personal sense, I've not known people to converse like this. But movies are usually elusive and illusional, aren't they?

Smart yet unstable, stable yet not smart. Got it. I liked the speech by Sam number 2. It was a speech which would have benefited my own life at one time; I would have listened, but unfortunately I didn't have the guy capable of understanding or presenting it.

713571,"The Forsyte clan would at once seem to be otherworldly with their Victorian English clothes and manners.  But when you look deeper all the familiar foils are there - sibling rivalry, black sheep and ne'er do wells that haunt every family.  Told at the turn of the century when people were marrying for money first and love second - it twists around the central character of Soames.  He's played amazingly by Damian Lewis, as a misunderstood man who loves beauty but can only own it rather than experience it.  In the hands of a lesser actor, Soames would have no redeeming qualities, but Lewis makes him human - odd with strange quirks and tics, but someone who wants to get love and just can't.  His frustration makes him mean and controlling, but for the want of someone, anyone who will show him some affection.I never read the books, but I found Irene to be a cold, vixen who made a choice to marry for money and then took up with every man who crossed her path - except her husband.  That had to annoy him - but nothing on the order of excusing the brutal marital rape scene depicted.  Soames is supposed to be unlikeable, but I found myself understanding, even empathizing with him.Their dysfunctional family includes the elder Forsyte brothers always in competition; the lecherous gambler - Darty and his wife Winnifred (Soames' sister) who put up with his debauchery - to a point; the two judgmental unmarried aunts; George who never seems to do much, but is always there; the black sheep (Joylon) who betrays his vows to follow his heart and some how still ends up with Irene (as does virtually every other man in the story).The other central character is June who is an abandoned child, then an abandoned woman (betrayed by Bossiny and Irene) and who must ultimately accept the woman who stole her lover as family (again).  She for some reason hates Soames, but forgives everyone else everything.  June I find a bit false in that she never seems to arrive at her betrayal being a function of both Irene and Phil, but rather lumps all wrongs onto Soames - he's a convenient target and easy to dislike.This is high drama, soap opera, lovers, trysts, betrayals, double crosses and in the end I return to Soames who must chose between his wife and the child he so desperately wants but can't seem to get in a heart wrenching decision - made dispassionately in classic Soames fashion.  It's as if he feels the emotions, but lacks the tools to express them - it all comes out as anger.  But there are moments...like when he lies to his father about having a son to give the dying man his last wish; or having to chose between his wife and child; or having to leave the wife and new born to go to his father's death bed.  He bears it stoically, but could you wipe away the steam and see underneath that glass - oh, what a roiling pot of trouble you'd find.  And the final scene of Soames and the baby took me back to the story his mother told about him smothering that kitten with too much love.  It's as if he lacks the ability to modulate his emotion - you get it all at once or none at all.The production's British, so naturally it's austere, understated, beautifully costumed and the sets are marvelous.  I, for one, would love to live at Robin Hill and having seen this I know now I must read the books from whence it sprang.  Lovely production and well worth the cost for the DVDs.",N/A

It is presented beautifully here, with each of the discs in its own thinpack, plus a separate thick booklet of the same dimensions. A solid box encloses all four pieces.This is the start of the Utena series. It introduces us to Utena, to Anthy, and to the members of the Student Council. The one thing I don't like is how often Anthy gets slapped. There are many relationships, some new, some long-established (including the girl with a long-running crush on Utena).It's a stylish series, with repeating elements, such as the shadow girls, which break up the storyline and add entertaining elegance.  The one piece of repetition that irritates me is Utena's approach to the dueling arena - it is always exactly the same - lazy animation. Once she arrives, each duel is different.This is the first third of the series, covering Utena's duels with the various members of the Student Council, and revealing some of their motives. The second third is already available in the same form (presented equally well) - it is the Black Rose Saga, and introduces a new challenge.

The first recipient of the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007.  This prize recognizes profound and popular effect of popular music.With Simon's various styles of music, entertainers came to perform his music, from the reggae style  ""Mother and Child Reunion"" with Stephen Marley, to the gospel sound of Jessy Dixon and Yolanda Adams singing ""Gone at Last"";  the black gospel quartet, Dixie Hummingbirds with James Taylor for ""Slip Slidin' Away""  to the African influence ofGraceland (2011 Remaster)with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, for ""Diamonds on the Souls of Their Feet"" and ""Homeless""; and  ""Under African Skies"" with Miriam Makeba.A few more outstanding performances, Marc Anthony, who is on Simon'sSongs from The Capeman, sings ""El Condor Pasa"";  ""Me and Julio"" with Stevie Wonder.  Allison Krauss with Shawn Colvin do a tender rendition of ""The Boxer"".  A very enjoyable performance was ""Love Me Like a Rock"" with the Dixie Hummingbirds, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon.There are some great clips that included George Harrison and Simon for ""Homeward Bound"";  the Muppets ""Feeling Groovy"" and a tribute to Joe Dimaggio at Yankee Stadium.This, to me, was really an enjoyable concert; the lighting was right, the entertainers were top of the line, the music was beautiful, and of course, the sound was excellent!  ........

The sound and visual quality are the best I've encountered since the theatrical release (even better, really, given the state of many theaters at the time). Much of the exterior work reveals a 70's era look, and graininess, but the interiors are sharply photographed, and there are some shots that are magnificently well lit. It's impressive how effective the opening montage is at setting up the future world, an extremely bleak one in which global warming (which almost no one discussed in those days except academics, who were consulted on the production) has destroyed the climate, the middle class is gone, the poor fight desperately for any kind of job they can get, and the superrich live in protected high-rise bubble universes, surrounded by guards.

1362543,"Like many people, I considered Jeremy Brett's depictions of Sherlock Holmes in the 1980s and 1990s to have been the non plus ultra of dramatizations of Conan Doyle's famous detective.  Thus I was somewhat skeptical when I read of plans to film new Sherlock adventures set in the 21st century. ""Blasphemy!"" was my first reaction: Holmes belongs in gaslit fog shrouded Victorian London.Fortunately, I was willing to give the new series a try, and from the first few moments I was riveted.  Benedict Cumberbatch is an ideal Holmes, transferring all the detective's celebrated mannerisms and quirks and giving them a new, modern polish.  Likewise Martin Freeman brings Watson to life marvellously, and the supporting cast is perfection.  The scenes move as rapidly as Holmes' own mind, so that you are literally on the edge of your seat hardly daring to blink lest you miss an important clue.The three adventures in this set come with a promise of perhaps more to come, and I certainly hope that is true, because I will never again see Holmes as a period piece, but as the thoroughly modern sleuth he deserves to be.",Sherlock: Season 1

This has all the episodes from the series across four discs, as well as extras including a bloopers reel and a short documentary. The various episodes are as humorous as the first series and my personal favourite has to be the one where Leonard's mother comes to visit; to see her interaction with Sheldon is nothing short of genius and makes for twenty minutes of exquisite TV. Wolowitz is as funny as ever trying to find love (be it in it's physical or relationship form) and the lines he comes out with will make you both burst out laughing and cringe. Penny and Sheldon's relationship develops as well and the episode where they buy Christmas presents for each other is especially good and touching. You also get the tension between Penny and Leonard and whilst their love never quite blossoms, they do develop a deeper friendship over the series. I still maintain that Sheldon is the funniest character but to be honest they all manage to raise a laugh at regular intervals. The series finale is especially good and I can't wait to see how it will pick up in series 3, fingers crossed it comes this way soon! All in all if you liked the first series then it is a safe bet you will enjoy this as well. It manages to maintain the high standards it set out for itself and continues to make geek chic the thing to aspire to. Well worth a viewing.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",N/A
500175,"""The Last Dinosaur"" is without a doubt one of my favorite films from growing up in the 70's. For years, fans wanted this film to come out on dvd since the Japanese import version was running $50 to $60. This release is the uncut version just like the Japanese import. The transfer is nice (looks great upconverted to 1080p via HDMI) and is anamorphic widescreen. This is the film that really made me like Richard Boone (R.I.P.). He was awesome in this film and when he did the voice for Smog in ""The Hobbit"". And who doesn't love Joan Van Ark? This film and ""The Land That Time Forgot"" ruled back then with the exception of the Gojira and Gamera franchises of course; even though they are monsters not dinosaurs. ""Dinosaurus"" and ""One Million Years B.C."" are classics too. The big megahit came when ""Quest For Fire"" was released in 1981 showcasing primitive humans; Rae Dawn Chong was incredible in the film. ""The Last Dinosaur"" is a fun and exciting way to spend a couple of hours on the weekend for any age. The legendary title song sung by Nancy Wilson is still incredibly beautiful but yet haunting.",N/A
1164689,"John-Pierre Melville's 1961 exploration of the friction between faith and desire stars John-Paul Belmondo in a cassock.  There's something very cool -- certainly intentional -- about Belmondo's look that only further fuels the sexual tension he evokes among the women encounters on his life's path.  But there are many factors at work here beyond the repressed sexuality inherent in a vow of celibacy.  Looming over everything are the shifting values of a post war France recovering from the war.  There's an aura of ambiguity and uncertainty in the world of this story, themes to which Melville would return and to which he was personally attracted.Belmondo's priest is the spiritual guardian of a small French village during the Nazi occupation.  He believes that anyone can be saved.  So when he encounters Barny (Emmanuella Riva), a sexually frustrated widow and communist militant who barges into his church and tears his religion apart, he reacts with compassion.  Thus an unexpected relationship is begun that is the core of the film's dramatic tensions and pleasures.A Jewish atheist, director Melville surprises us with a movie seemingly filled with religion.  But a closer look reveals only the frightening distortions created between lonely people caught in prisons of their newly discovered existential freedom.  Or, in other words, the paradoxical dilemma of the traps imposed by our free-will choices.Melville once glibly said the main idea of the film was none of the kind, but only to ""show this amorous priest who likes to excite girls but doesn't sleep with them.""  But I think Melville knew better.  One thing's for sure: It's impossible to imagine this film with a star other than Belmondo.  His rumpled charisma and physicality, even in a liturgical frock, are astonishing.  That face!","Leon Morin, Pretre (The Forgiven Sinner) - with ENGLISH subtitles (Import)"
439033,"Viewed: 8/08Rate: 108/08: Although I've seen the lame, stale spoofs Airplane! and Airplane II: The Sequel a few times in the past, I wasn't familiar with the original film Airport until now. I must say, saying that Airport is the king of disaster films isn't unrealistic because it's that good. Moreover, I found the suspense to be exhilarating and exciting. The heavy drama behind the central focus of the film made the whole film intriguing and gripping and not all that different from the movie From Here to Eternity. The performances given by the cast are excellent, and the standouts obviously are Dean Martin and Helen Hayes. Burt Lancaster was pretty good himself. I loved the story and the unfolding of it right up to the climax. One of the best scenes in the film is when Dean Martin was asked why the plane is turning around, and he explains to the boy in very technical language as possible to sweep off the inquiring minds. Another scene is how Helen Hayes, as Ada Quonsett, plays the cunning con making her way from the bathroom into inside of the Boeing 707. There is plenty of disaster films that seem to prefer to go straight into the disaster within fifteen to thirty minutes. But not Airport...this one took a long time since much of the time was spent on secondary stories before finally the chief reason of why the film was made in the first place...pretty much similar to how the 1997 film Titanic worked. One great technique of Airport is how the editor skillfully put together two shots of people talking to each other as if they were on phone, radio headset, etc. I mean, I've seen this device to be used many times before in a bad way, but in Airport, it's brilliant, flawless, and purposeful. Another thing I loved about Airport is how instructional the movie is: how aviation works, how best handle an imminent airline disaster, and how to react to certain situations. Surely, what I will know will come from my knowledge of seeing Airport. Looking at the etiquette of the passengers in an airplane, I was actually surprised how different it is from today, and even the people were allowed to smoke and be granted a glass of champagne. All in all, Airport, although I am saying that it is a perfect film, has it all: the drama, the suspense, the thrills, the unpredictability, and the gripping feel. It's certainly one of the best films I've seen in my life.",Airport VHS
1041350,"First Preface: This movie was so entertaining at so many different levels that I wish Amazon could organize their movie reviews in a more dynamic way so I could ""get at"" the more interesting, insightful ones faster.Second Preface: I was angry and embarrassed when Hollywood saw fit to give ""American Beauty"" the Oscar for Best Picture and then claim the award was all about the film's ""transcendental irony,"" ""magical realism,"" etc. ""Stranger than Fiction"" is several times cleverer and more transcendental (magical? surreal?), and not so much as a whisper of attention that I am aware of. Never mind that ""American Beauty"" came out several years before this one. They should have passed over ""American Beauty"" anyway and held out for something that was REALLY entertaining, uplifting, AND truly out-of-the-mold, avant garde, etc.I bought this movie after enjoying Maggie Gyllenhaal in ""Secretary"" opposite James Spader. When I want to see more of a particular actor after seeing one of their films, I look them up on Amazon and read the reviews of the films with the best average ratings. For Gyllenhaal, ""Stranger than Fiction"" attracted my attention and the list of other actors in the film sealed the deal.As others have noted, five minutes into this movie I knew I was going to REALLY LOVE it. Everybody was photographed so well. The writing was superb... as was every actor's performance.Some other points worth mentioning:1. As full an experience as this film was/is, the extras made it that much more so. Generous, illuminating, and a completion of an already superb experience.2. The integration of GUI-style graphics in this film broke new ground in my experience by adding a whole new layer of information about what the main character is thinking as he is acting, AND being narrated by the voice-over of Emma Thompson's character. How RICH and COOL is that?! Previously, a similar GUI device was used in the ""Terminator"" to underscore the fact that ""The Arnold's"" character was a cyborg. USed her with a human, it added an extra dimension of description of the (human) character. Given a choice, this film buff would prefer to see this device explored more fully by Hollywood than the rehash of 3-D.3. I am intrigued by one of the opening scenes in which Ms. Thompson's character steps off of a tall building. I knew she was going to do it, but I could not look away. Once it became clear that the author with writer's block was not deceased, I am at a complete loss as to why it is in the film... all the more reason to watch the movie a seccond time in as many days.4. Maggie Gyllenhaal does not disappoint. Quite the opposite. Who is this woman? In an effort to find out, I'm going back for another of her movies. Also, as a result of her perrformance in this movie and ""Secretary,"" I will trust the next movie that comes out with her in it... I trust her judgement that much... first rate... ditto the director.5. For me, this movie was wonderful in the same strange and magical way as M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" and I hope to discover others situated in this odd nether world between realism and surrealism... perhaps I will give Robin William's ""What Dreams May Come"" another viewing.6. After a few days and a reading of Henry David Thoreau's essay, ""Civil Disobedience,"" I have an elevated appreciation for the subtext of civil disobediance undertaken by Miss Gyllenhaal's character, and by the choice to write the hero as a functionary for the IRS. As described by Thoreau, Ms. Gylenhaal's character is Thoreau's avatar in her insistance on living her life from the inside-out, and resisting the government's interest in her support for policies with which she disagrees (implied by her refusal to pay her taxes in proportion to the size of the government's expenditures for things with which she disagrees). Likewise, the fact that she becomes involved with (in essence) a tax collector who is more machine than man makes this association even more compelling. Any reading of Thoreau's essay will convince the reader that it was a powerful influence that shaped this story line. Interestingly, this is only hinted at in the special feature commentaries by Miss Gyllenhaal.",N/A
1349199,"After waking up in a small wooden coffin, Paul Conroy (Reynolds) uses everything he has (lighter and cell phone) to find a way out.  The movie opens with no sound or picture for about 30 seconds, then the lighter flicks on and we see Conroy.  That's where the camera stays the entire time.  Except for a short cell phone video Reynolds is the only person we see in the movie.  But much like Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"" he is enough to carry it alone and you forget you only see him.  I know what your thinking...how good can a movie be if it only has one person in it the entire time with only a lighter and a cell phone.  The answer is simple.  Fantastic!  This movie feels so real, (the claustrophobia aspect helps) that it is the most tense I've been while watching a movie since I can't remember.  You are right there feeling his frustration and outright anger at the people he calls you want to throw something at the screen.  Not to give anything away, but the ending will leave you breathless.  That also leads to the one downside of the movie.  Like the ""Sixth Sense"" its not one that will have the same effect when watched a second time.  I give it an A.",Buried
1353511,"Neal Caffrey's beloved girlfriend has been blown to bits in a plane explosion. So it's not surprising that the former gentleman thief spends ""White Collar Season 2"" searching for whoever killed her, even as he struggles to help Peter with even more elaborate cons, thefts and murders -- as well as an ever-twisting game of trust.Devastated by Kate's death, Neal (Matthew Bomer) goes back to working with Peter (Tim DeKay) and the FBI. But now he isn't just trying to stay out of prison -- he's trying to find out who is responsible for his girlfriend's death, and why she had to die. The secret lies in the mysterious music box that the FBI has in its custody, which holds the key to a long-buried secret.And in the meantime, Neal and Peter solve some very elaborate crimes -- corrupt politicians, bank robbers, a copycat criminal, a disappearing waitress that Mozzie is attracted to, adoption extortions, corporate espionage, FBI corruption, an aging conman, corporate espionage, diplomatic disasters in Burma, an old enemy who has Peter kidnapped, identity-switching to uncover a power company scam, and Peter being framed for a crime he didn't commit...The second season of ""White Collar"" actually feels more like the second half of one reeeeaalllyy long season -- the running subplot of Kate's death and the mysterious music box run all the way through it. Those subplots add a lot of suspense to this season, particularly since we never quite know what the music box is for until the end.The writers maintain a solid balance of solid action and detective work, but they keep an eye on the warmer side of the show -- such as Peter's loving relationship with his wife, or Neal and Diana goofing around in bathrobes. And as always, there's a small but healthy dose of comic relief, mostly from the ever-entertaining Mozzie. He's always doing something strange and/or hilarious (""Hiter clones!"" ""Please tell me he's joking"").The one writing downside is that the writers clumsily shoehorn not one but TWO love interests for Neal at the end of the season. It feels like a forced attempt to have a love triangle.Bomer and DeKay still have great chemistry -- they have that buddy-cop atmosphere, where there's just a little tension and witty sniping to spice things up, but they really are solid friends. Willie Garsona and Tiffany Thiessen round out the main cast very well. And they thankfully got rid of.... whoever the female FBI agent was last season, in favor of the wry, witty Marsha Thomason.""White Collar Season Two"" plays out the various subplots that the first season set up, and introduces some solid new crimes.

282419,"I grew up with a recorded VHS broadcast of this ballet and even now, it still strikes me as a beautiful and emotional piece of work. Barishnikov has created exquisite and poignant choreography that's not just pretty leaping and jumping, it tells a story in itself. Echoing what another reviewer said, this is especially evident in the Act II Pas de Deux (my favorite piece from the ballet), where the emotion and romance is highly palpable compared to another Nutcracker production I have (Nutcracker: The Motion Picture--1986), where it honestly seemed that Clara and the Prince were just going through the motions. Gelsey Kirkland, Mikhail Barishnikov and Alexander Minz all execute their roles beautifully and it's simply just a joy to watch every time! Some important points:The Arab/Coffee dance is omitted from the production because Barishnikov was under a time constraint for the televised program.In addition to the three toys that dance for the children at the party, there is an additional puppet show that Drosselmeyer puts on for them, which is not part of the traditional plotline and foreshadows the battle between the Prince and the Mouse King.Fritz appears but is not involved in the breaking of the nutcracker at all--that honor goes to a drunken guest at the Christmas party. In addition, the traditional reason for the breaking was out of spite, but in this version, it happens because Clara asks Drosselmeyer to make the nutcracker lifesize. The drunken party guest overhears this and coming over to Clara, pulls on the nutcracker's head trying to make it bigger, which results in it coming off in his hand.It is heavily implied in this adaptation that this same party guest reincarnates later on as the Mouse King, as they are seen wearing similar/identical attire. As another reviewer states, this can be translated into Clara's apparent fear of men (traditionally she is in her teens or even younger), and the dream that Drosselmeyer gives Clara, especially the Act II Pax de Deux, is a therefore a form of gentle godfatherly encouragement for Clara to step out of her shell. This is only one way to analyze the adaptation. All in all, the drunken guest breaking the nutcracker is a great way of foreshadowing his later reappearance as the Mouse King, an arc that gives the story a greater sense of depth as far as Clara's psychology is concerned.Mother Ginger does not appear in this version, and the corresponding dance number is done by four court clowns. The dance delves into the more acrobatic side of dance and for me, is always enjoyable to watch. The clowns in general are great fun as well, their acting is wonderful and they do a great job of adding humor here and there when featured on camera.This version is, I think, less lavish than others especially in terms of sets. The second act in particular has a relatively bland set that, when darkened, fades to a murky dark backdrop and nothing more.But when it comes down to it, this adaptation is a jewel. Strong points include tangible emotion in the storytelling, especially in the Clara-Prince-Drosselmeyer dynamic, and also the dimming of stage lights for Clara and the Prince's solo dances and their Pas de Deux, which gives the story a much more intimate feel and boosts the romance factor in the Pas de Deux. Although the sets are a bit lacking in vibrancy in Act II, that is not necessarily a bad thing as it is guaranteed not to distract from the dancing. Simply put, this is just beautiful. Some people complain about the quality, but then again, this was done in 1977, when Blu-Ray quality was still an impossible dream. Besides, it's good enough that you'll stop noticing after a while :)",The Nutcracker The American Ballet Theatre  VHS
9513,"As a celebration of the mythic power of baseball and its central place in the American cultural unconscious,""The Natural"" is virtually without peer in film. Although the film bathes characters and events in a honeyed light totally at variance with Malamud's dark and pessimistic source novel, Levinson's film is emotionally satisfying, if narratively improbable. Redford, at age 48, is a decade too old for the unlucky Roy Hobbs, but his waning golden boy aura combines with the dappled sunlight of the countryside and the shower of electric light particles at the film's climax to create indelible imagery. His blonde co-stars, Close and Basinger, are Janus-like romantic partners, one devoted and one duplicitous,as part of a cast which includes Duvall as a cynical sports journalist and perfectly cast Brimley and Farnsworth as the Merlin-like elders guiding the NY Knights, stand-ins for the NY Yankees and Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. Both the natural elements of light and dark, sun and rain, and the precisely rendered ambience of 1930's hotels, restaurants, baseball stadia and locker rooms are vividly realized in this Blu-ray which is a masterpiece of its kind.

I  will side with the second hand.  One reviewer says that acting and writing has improved light years from this movie.  Well, if it has, I haven't noticed.  Movies are an art form, that is unless you're into documentaries.  Art emits emotions and feelings: like disgust, intrigue, lust, pain and pity.  Great art also comes from great artists and Elizabeth Taylor is one of the greatest.  I have to admit I had prurient expectations going in- just look at the cover, for god's sake!  And i wasnt disappointed because Elizabeth in my book was/is the most beautiful woman on the planet.  But what I forgot is that her acting ability is superior.

266429,"Henry Fonda is so believable in his starring role in The Grapes of Wrath.  Though slow-paced, the movie gets you very emotionally involved in his family's journey from Dust Bowl-destroyed Oklahoma to California, because you sympathize with Fonda and the rest of his family immediately.  From the beginning, he seems like he's a bit scared and kind of helpless, and all of them feel that way about leaving their land.  Once in California, the family is no better off.  As I found out on the audiocommentary, the Farmers' Association in California terrorized migrant farmers about as badly as the KKK terrorized black people.  They exploited migrant farmers and looked down on them for being hickish, and smeared anyone who wanted better pay as a ""Communist"".  They had thugs trying to create conflict so they could intimidate organized labor.  It was interesting to learn that John Steinbeck, the author, was not himself a communist, but felt people ought not to be quick to stereotype anyone with communist views as ""un-American"".  The movie is said to be a lot more hopeful and less politically radical than the book.  Steinbeck said he wanted the book to be revealing, not satisfying, and provoke people to enact social reform.  It really opened my eyes to the day-to-day difficulties of surviving in poverty.  Director John Ford is very visually expressive, and on this, he has Citizen Kane cinematographer Gregg Toland working with him, creating a starkness with shadows, a closeness to the land through the composition of the shots, and a documentary feeling.  On the back of the disc are a documentary about the Fox studio head, Darryl F. Zanuck, and several other smaller features.  This is not a ""fun"" movie, but it is worthwhile and should make you forever more sympathetic to the plight of the poor.About the Darryl Zanuck documentary on the back of the disc:For a general story of 20th Century Fox and its contributions to entertainment, look no further than this biography of Darryl F. Zanuck. A & E Biography always does well at combining personal and private, film footage and interviews, and narration in a fast-paced, meaningful way. This documentary is on the DVD of The Grapes of Wrath. You learn about the person of Darryl Zanuck and some of the risks and contributions he made to cinema. One thing I found particularly interesting is that The Longest Day and The Sound of Music were both made under intense financial pressure to recover from the extremely wasteful spending of Cleopatra (which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton). Some of Zanuck's unique contributions were his willingness, like Harry Warner of Warner Brothers, to shine light on disturbing social problems, and that he used CinemaScope to get people going back to theaters after television threatened the movie industry.",N/A

1423672,"Sure, all of us played the game, Ghost, when we were kids.  Most of us, however, didn't take it as far as the chuckleheads in this movie did.  Shallowness of main characters aside, Forget Me Not is still an interesting take on the traditional ghost game.  It is also a body count and revenge flick all rolled into one narrative.  Without throwing in that annoying spoiler, you will also experience an inversion of the traditional protagonist-antagonist motif, as well as varying degrees of altering reality.  All in all, this is a pretty impressive accomplishment for a supposedly B-grade movie.  And now for a quick word on our scary ghosts who were scary, because they didn't appear on the screen for too long a period of time.  Pale and indistinct from the sheer brevity of sight, they hearken back to the childhood time when boogiemen really did seem to exist out of the corner of your eye and you almost always just-but not quite-caught one moving towards you.  In the spirit of this, the most time your mind will ever have to take in one of movie ghosts is one, maybe two seconds.  Is it a perfect movie?  Oh-ho, no.  The acting is never above quasi-believable and the writers obviously spend about as much time creating these believable characters and the film itself did inside the movie theater, if it ever even got that far to begin with.

Christian Slater plays the cussing, drinking killer priest (all only in church though) and Kim Coates plays the bad guy. At the ten-minute mark the screening became almost a laugh track as so many things had already gone wrong; The BD clarity was DVD to below average quality, the sound had been mixed poorly in every scene, the writing was obviously being improvised (later proven so in the making-of), and the overall feel of the film was beneath the low-budget approach.The long list of things that kept going wrong with the film made it to where I ended up offering the film for free and no customers were interested that had watched the clips. The music score drowned out dialogue, the flashbacks throughout the film of varying characters were cartoonish, and when the two main leads (Gooding and Slater) made it appear they were unhappy and miserable doing their parts - the film just becomes pointless. Kim Coates does save the day though, both in the film and in the making-of. The 11:49 minute supplement is also laughable as they left in all of the ""chaotic"" issues in making this film. But Kim gave a great snippet about knowing Gary Oldman years before and the advice shared by Gary to him, worth the watch just for that.The packaging shows Region 1 coded (obviously Millenium does not even invest in making their BD art correct), the sound says 5.1 but I dispute even that, English and Spanish subs. Writing about this will seem like I am trying to find more things wrong with the film but mostly I was making sure the four planted reviews here were countered just a bit. Not even a renter.",N/A
1300374,"Freddy Kruegar is back in this all new 2010 remake of Wes Craven's 80s classic, A Nightmare on Elm Street. Freddy is taking revenge on teenagers, he's haunting them in their sleep and if they die in their sleep, they are really dead. While teenagers try to save their lives by not sleeping, they are only killing themselves. Freddy is here for revenge, revenge for the teenagers who told on him and for their parents (trying to) kill him!Okay, let's start it off her, I've only seen four Nightmare on Elm Street movies including this one, I've seen the first, second, and Freddy vs. Jason (if it counts), but I actually really liked it. The acting was pretty good and the movie kept me interested. The first time I saw this movie (in the theaters) I didn't like it much, it took to long to start and I was waiting for it to begin by the time it ended, but I decided to give the movie one more chance thinking, ""Maybe it's a better movie at home?"" and it was! I was surprised by how much more I enjoyed it! It is definitely worth watching!I rented the Blu-Ray and it is the RENTAL editon with no special features whatsoever.If you want to buy this movie do NOT buy it New from Amazon because they are currently selling the 1-Disc Edition. I recommend you buy it from an Amazon that offers the 3-Disc edition and I'm sure it's cheaper than Amazon itself.[RECOMMENDED]",N/A

What you'll see is some dv camera filmed low budget serious mystery/horror movie with un-hammy bad acting.  You'd think Angle is the problem; nope, he's fine compared to the other bit characters.  The moral of the story is that just because you have a script and a camera doesn't mean you should put it on film without thinking about it first.  If this was shot with 35mm and the actors hammed it up in the 80's horror/comedy style, it would work and be enjoyable; in digital with ""serious"" acting, it does not.",River of Darkness

257487,"The year 1969 marked a radical change in the way people looked at that most American of genres, the Western; for in that year, even though John Wayne was able to secure an Oscar for his performance in the old-fashioned TRUE GRIT, the Western underwent a shocking transformation via three films of the rapidly changing times variety.  Two of those were director Sam Peckinpah's extremely violent epic THE WILD BUNCH, and Sergio Leone's equally magisterial (but less violent) ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.  The third, and even less violent, of this trio was BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.Although the film greatly softens the story of the real-life outlaws, who were every bit as merciless as any in Western history (they robbed banks and trains for much of the 1890s in the Rockies, and killed many before they were forced out by progress and a relentless Pinkerton agency), it benefits greatly from having Paul Newman and Robert Redford paired together in the first of their two hugely successful big screen pairings (the other being THE STING), portray the two outlaws who, after blowing up a Union Pacific train with enough dynamite to level a building, find themselves hounded by Pinkerton agents as they make a break for it.  Aided and abetted by schoolteacher Etta Place (Katharine Ross), they journey way, way South to Bolivia to continue their bank-robbing ways, which subsequently makes them a target again.  It all climaxes in the little Bolivian town of San Vicente, where, trapped by the Army and refusing to surrender, they come out with their guns blazing one last time.While both director George Roy Hill (who would also helm THE STING) and legendary screenwriter William Goldman, together with Newman and Redford, do a great deal to sand down the much rougher aspects of the real-life outlaws, there are plenty of solid action sequences (the blow-up of the train; Newman and Redford jumping off a cliff into the river; the last moments), and a great deal of funny one-liners that are breezy and hip, while also acknowledging the durability of the Western genre as it exited the 1960s and entered the 1970s.  Ross adds a lot of credibility as Etta Place, as do such well-known genre acolytes as Strother Martin, Jeff Corey, and Henry Jones.  Bacharach's period score, which also includes the B.J. Thomas hit ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" (written in collaboration with Bacharach's partner Hal David), is also hugely appropriate.Although far less radical than either THE WILD BUNCH or ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, BUTCH CASSIDY is also a long ways away from the John Wayne model as well, since, for all its humorous elements, there is that creeping cynicism of progress and the law shutting down the old West in this film that was evident in Peckinpah's and Leone's films.  As with so many Westerns, this film is blessed with the solid cinematography of Conrad Hall, who also worked on THE PROFESSIONALS, and location shoots in various Western locales and (as a stand-in for Bolivia) the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.  The end result may not have been the seismic shock wave that Peckinpah's and Leone's epics were, but it still reflected a new way of thinking about the genre and appreciating (and, in many ways, even mourning) what we lost on the way to progress and civilization.  This remains one of the genre's all-time unquestioned highpoints.",N/A
1326203,"I enjoyed ""ThirtySomething"" when it originally ran on TV and I now enjoy their DVD sets again. This is a show that really gets into the hearts and minds of a variety of individuals whose lives are intertwined through friendship, family and marriage. The series explores the real problems experienced by these individuals and does so very honestly and openly. Struggles with children, careers, infidelity, health, relationship - all very real and still dealt with and faced the same way today as they were when the series first aired. Young and older viewers, I feel, can relate to the characters. It's something that never changes or grows old.Each episode is packed with stories of issues that are meaningful - some will make you laugh, others will make you cry, while still some others will show you just how confusing life is and how, with the help of good friends such as are within the group which comprises the cast of ThirtySomething, we can get through it all, one way or another.I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed it the first time around. Good stories, good acting by a cast who presents themselves as very realistic characters - the kind of life portrayal that will make you feel like you're joining your own close friends in conversation about the very real facts of everyday life. Guaranteed - you'll bond with some, or all, of these characters, for every aspect of life is explored in this series - you can't help but find yourself within there!I highly recommend this series - any and each season!",N/A

1412124,"I am not overly familiar with Bollywood films but I understand that, as many of them as they make, they are the same few plot lines over and over again. Here they remake an old Peter Sellers movie 'After the Fox.' Tees Maar Khan is a master criminal who is going to pull off a huge heist. To do so he poses as a film director who will shoot his next masterpiece in a small village and use the villagers in the film and unwittingly in the heist.This is a comedy but the Indian sense of comedy isn't the same as ours so it just doesn't generate many laughs. Their facial expressions and physical movements are all over-exaggerated. Pretty much like something you'd see from Jerry Lewis in the 60s. Those days are long and gratefully gone.The cast is OK. Katrina Kaif is stunningly beautiful as the female lead. Akshay Kumar is so-so as the male lead. He has a decent screen presence but I found nothing particularly appealing about him. The secondary characters didn't do much for me. Their performances, along with the writing, are out of step with the times.Surprisingly, at almost two and a half hours, there are only three dance numbers. The first, featuring Katrina, is great. The choreography is outstanding and she is a thrill to watch. The other two are good but pale by comparison. The other production values are OK. The color schemes are vibrant. A lot of primary colors blast their way off the screen. The set compositions are OK as is the directing.This is not a bad movie but there are better Hindi movies out there and at this length I really cannot recommend it.",Tees Maar Khan
1125525,"Alright, I'll admit I wanted to watch this movie in large part because kick-ass Jodie Foster is in it, but it delivered.  You have the complicated, slightly twisted protagonist (Erica Bain) who goes to the dark side, as it were, after suffering an inhuman assault that leaves her would-be husband dead.  It leaves her with PTSD and the chilling realization that she has not only the ability but the desire to kill.  Labeling the antagonist of the movie is rather difficult.  There are the men who beat her and her fianc&eacute;, but they do not play a major role in the movie.  I would claim that she is also the antagonist.  She is fighting herself the whole movie knowing that what she is doing is wrong (killing bad guys on the street) but also knows there needs to be justice.  Very interesting character.

1379303,"I saw this for the first time when I was around 9 or 10years old. My step father took me and my siblings and we were bored to death. He ended up just taking us out of the theater because we were obviously restless. I had thought that as an adult I would appreciate the combination of the beautiful artwork and the classical music. I was wrong. I turned this on, and while I do think it is beautiful and the music is fantastic I was asleep within minutes.

1399265,"The film critics I've read have done an unusually good job discussing The Lincoln Lawyer, as I saw it.  I will just hit the main points about the movie, pro and con, that made an impression on me.  Overall, I thought the movie was well-acted, well-produced, and entertaining, even if limited by what might be called a good TV-caliber screenplay.The movie drew me in at the very start when the Lincoln town car of the title and its driver turned out not to be the phony Hollywood glitz I had expected but a seedy image that fit the movie perfectly.  (One amateur review's complaint that the car somehow failed to serve its purpose simply because the title character drove around in other vehicles at various points is silly.)  The well-acted characters and unusually dingy L.A. settings generally felt authentic, as far as they went.  Matthew McConaughey fit naturally, smoothly, and effectively into the lead character of Mick Haller.  Haller is a slick, shady L.A. criminal defense lawyer who gets results for his low-life clients, even if things do not always turn out for the best.  Haller runs into serious problems, suffers blows from them, does not act always and mindlessly cocky (unlike the annoying, one-note young prosecutor-on-the-make in the movie Fracture), yet draws on enough strength, ingenuity, and resourcefulness that his confidence rarely fails him.  This made him fun to watch.  Sometimes, he stepped over the line, but not so far as to throw believability to the winds.  The story was basically interesting and tied up fairly neatly.  In fact, it is quite an accomplishment to make a mystery thriller that was generally this entertaining and satisfying without going completely over the top, the way so many of these kind of movies do (such as The Firm, Final Analysis, Just Cause, Guilty as Sin, General's Daughter, and the Ashley Judd films Double Jeopardy and High Crimes).  Lincoln Lawyer was refreshingly free of exploitative, sensational scenes used to gin up cheap shock value, horror, suspense, or titillation.At the same time, I have to agree with the critics that the movie's story and characters do seem familiar.  Although workmanlike, including the courtroom scenes, well-handled by McConaughey, the movie lacked the sparks of imagination, originality, intricacy, and electricity that can sometimes come from films like this.  It did not really hit the high notes that make watching not just enjoyable but exciting.  The writing, while good, seemed more like a script for a high-quality TV show than theatrical film.  And some of the supporting characters, especially Haller's ex-wife and the bail bondsman, were badly under-developed and pasted on, wasting talented actors in nothing or contrived roles.  Haller's interactions with his ex-wife were not convincing.  Similarly unconvincing was the degree to which he felt a crisis of conscience about the way he represented a past client in light of newly discovered information from representing his current, rich-boy client, accused of trying to beat to death a woman he met at a bar.  Haller had more practical and selfish reasons for resolving the current case the way he did, without delving so deeply into soul-searching and noble motives, which seemed ill-suited to the rest of the movie.",The Lincoln Lawyer

I remember seeing Dangerous Liaisons many years ago, and I cannot say it made a lasting impression upon me.  However, this film certainly did.  The lavish costumes and settings were pleasurable to watch, and the acting well done.  I'm surprised that it never received the attention the Hollywood version did.

1414426,"I just saw ""Bill Cunningham New York"", a documentary movie about a person previously unknown to me, and what an exuberant work it is! The brilliance is in the editing, so that we gradually move from an outside perspective to a sense of what might be driving this extraordinary individual. A written description might give the impression that he is perhaps slightly autistic but, watching him interact, you realise he is a highly focused and driven person, with a good nature, joyful disposition and wonderful sense of ethics that is doubly wonderful because it is never imposed on others.For me the two key take-outs were firstly, a celebration of New York and Paris, the two great cities that most embrace liberty. Thinking of my own hometown Melbourne Australia and its tut-tut brigade and rigorous policing, Bill could never pull this off here. I mean, you can't even ride a bicycle without a helmet. He'd have been arrested thousands of times for photographing, jay-walking or weaving in and out of traffic. And the people he films - those individuals who define ""the edge"" in all its glorious variety - again the movie enables us to develop a vivid sense of New York's vibrant imagination. Liberty - such a celebration!The second point is perhaps more striking. This movie is much like the wonderful ""Into The Wild"" from a few years ago in that both chart a the true story of a man who completely forsakes the materialistic life and in the process achieves near-total freedom. The remarkable thing about Bill is that he manages to pull it off while living in the midst of a highly individualistic, hedonistic, materialistic environment. He is vigorously engaged with it but seemingly unaffected; he never seems to criticise, his photographs are invariably kind. And he takes ""conflict of interest"" to a whole new level; the movie undoubtedly will challenge the comfortable assumptions we all make. While ""Into The Wild"" charts a young man's journey into an unmaterialistic life, in ""Bill Cunningham New York"" he reached there many decades ago and we are left to wonder about his journey. What we do see is the daily existence of a highly productive, unmaterialistic and essentially free person, we see that it is real and possible.",Bill Cunningham New York

Even though it was released in the mid-90s, the special and visual effects in this film are still jaw-dropping amazing!  Most effects nowadays are done with computers, but this film combines digital effects with models!  And they managed to do it so that it doesn't look like it was filmed in someone's basement!This film is loosely based off of a book with the same title which was released in the 50s, I believe.  While they refurbished, updated, and rewrote portions of the original story, this film is still compelling.Be forewarned though.  There's a measureable amount of blood and gore in this one.  But it isn't so much that the movie is unwatchable.This product arrived in a timely fashion from the seller.  I would definitely purchase from them again if the situation presents itself.",N/A

313284,"Wow, how do you get a flirtatious extramarital affair past the censors in 1945?  A big no-no, especially with their leading ladies and boy nextdoor leading men.  But they found a way to double-cancel the problem and love conquers all.Esther Williams winds up abandoned on her honeymoon and keeps bumping into Van Johnson, who can't swim.  She's lovely, lonesome and feeling neglected.  Van is handsome, smitten and just back from being lost in action during the war.  With nothing else to do, she winds up teaching him how to swim.The music from Tommy Dorsey's orchestra still sounds wonderful and vibrant, just what you'd want to hear in a beautiful hotel.  Opera singer Lauritz Melchior is perhaps a little off the wall in this piece, and a bit of a ham, but he has a Gerber Baby look about him as he tries to endure a strict diet.  Who goes to a first class hotel to go on a diet?  A hotel worker watches him like a hawk and even sits down and eats his food when he tries to cheat.  That part is a little silly, but you'll enjoy the stars, the swimming, the swing music and the sets.",Thrill of a Romance VHS
391317,"`A Walk in the Clouds' is a gentle, touching film that makes for perfect Sunday afternoon viewing.When a US soldier (Paul ) returns home after the second world war he comes across a pregnant lady in distress (Victoria) and pretends to be her husband to save her family from dishonour. He accompanies her back to her families vineyard in the Napa Valley, California and struggles to win over her father, whilst learning about family commitment and the ways of the vineyard.The settings of this film are stunning and the valley vineyards and redwood forests make for a beautiful backdrop to this heart-warming story.  Keanu Reeves, as we have sadly come to expect, acts terribly; the wood in the vines around him have more life and nuance.  But it goes some way to show how good this film is that it retains its charm regardless of the poor performance from the leading actor.  Anthony Quinn is wonderful and full of life as the family patriarch and Victoria's grandfather.This film doesn't have, and doesn't need, any big effects or gimmicks to sell it the audience.  It is old fashioned film making at it's best where the story itself is enough to win you over and keep you watching.  This film has it's flaws, but they aren't insurmountable and generally it makes for a pleasant, heart warming 90 minutes viewing.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",A Walk in the Clouds VHS

1277968,"Astoundingly cheesy, lame and pathetic. And this coming on the heels of a previous review stating how much I enjoyed the films that had come out of the WWE. Guys like Steve Austin and Dwayne Johnson had dispelled the idea that wrestling types could be nothing more than cardboard caricatures.Sadly, this Kurt Angle vehicle proved that my original fears were, at least in this case, correct.This barely b-grade flick is evocative of the annual high school drama class production which we all cringed to watch in the school auditorium. 'End Game' delivered the near-perfect symbiosis of stiff wooden acting, ridiculous score, horrific costume design, derivative cinematography, and a plot that must've been written on the back of an IHOP menu.This pile of crap would've made the Troma guys embarrassed and Golan & Globus of the Cannon Group gawk in stunned amazement.If you went to film school for exactly one day and quit - you'd still have a leg up on Bruce Koehler, the hack that was given directorship of this cheapo monstrosity.",End Game
1428388,"This will probably be a strong seller in TCM's ""Greatest Classic Films"" series, a programme designed to bring some of the best MGM/Warner-controlled films to the masses in budget-friendly sets.  Unlike the previous TCM sets, this collection has each film presented on it's own disc, as opposed to four films sharing two double-sided discs.MGM's 1940 production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of my favourite screen versions of the Jane Austen classic.  Greer Garson stars as Elizabeth Bennet, and Laurence Olivier (fresh from his ""Wuthering Heights"" success) is a fine Darcy.  MGM costumier Adrian threw the original Regency period setting of the book out of the window - the result being that Garson and the ladies almost suffocate under costumes made of endless frilly laces and satins.  Classic MGM...never let a story's period setting get in the way of a good costume!  Special Features - Oscar-nominated Crime Doesn't Pay short ""Eyes of the Navy"", and classic cartoon ""The Fishing Bear"".MGM's 1949 colour remake of LITTLE WOMEN sparkles with June Allyson (perfectly-cast as Jo), along with Mary Astor as Marmee, Margaret O'Brien as Beth, Janet Leigh as Meg, Peter Lawford as Laurie; and a blonde-wigged Elizabeth Taylor as Amy.  Though it falls decidedly short next to the well-regarded 1933 RKO version with Katharine Hepburn, MGM's 1949 remake oddly copies many of the original set and costume cues from the earlier film.  Special Features - ""Lux Radio Theater"" broadcast with the original stars (audio), and ""Successful Women-Successful Films"" essay.Jennifer Jones is positively haunting, as Gustave Flaubert's MADAME BOVARY.  This 1949 Vincente Minnelli-directed masterpiece, filmed in crisp black-and-white, may very well just be Jones' greatest screen performance.  As the simple country doctor's wife who yearns to experience a life of glamour, wealth and romance, Jennifer Jones madly spins into her doom in the movie's signature ballroom sequence.  A sheer masterpiece.  With Louis Jourdan, Van Heflin and James Mason.  Special Features - Pete Smith Specialty short ""Those Good Old Days"", classic cartoon ""Out-Foxed""; and the trailer.Greta Garbo had already filmed Tolstoy's tragic story of ""Anna Karenina"" (as ""Love"") during her silent days, but the 1935 MGM remake of ANNA KARENINA stands as one of her finest performances.  Matched by a fervent Fredric March as Vronsky, Garbo's Anna is as mysterious and otherwordly as the fog from which she emerges at the beginning of the story.The original stand-alone DVDs ofLittle WomenandAnna Karenina (1935)are now out-of-print (withMadame Bovary (1949)looking like it's going to be discontinued soon too); so this set will be good for those who missed out last time.",TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Literary Romance (Little Women / Pride and Prejudice / Madame Bovary / Anna Karenina)
1171497,"3.4 starsI loved the series, especially the running storyline with Smoking Man et al. I also enjoyed many of the stand-alone tales, into which this movie fits. But even in the extended cut I find this film to be barely as good as even the most mediocre old episodes.One of the best things about the series was its subtlety; it gave the viewer credit for intelligence, and rarely hit us over the head with gore or violence. But not here. The occasional gruesome scenes really distracted me from the main thing on display, the rekindling of the Mulder/Scully thang.[Spoilers] So M and S do some kissing, and are shown in bed, etc. Nice for those who waited for it, but for those of us who loved the show mainly for sharp dialogue and very crafty ideas, there's little of either here. The banter is ok but not up to snuff, and who needs to see all those hacked limbs and severed heads? Just doesn't feel like what I want from the X-Folks. Which is weird, as Carter and Spotnick did all of this. Maybe they thought they needed some sensationalism to sell tickets.Oh well, it ain't bad, and it has some strengths such as good production values, etc, but all in all I had hoped for a lot more, and a lot less.However, the blu-ray does have a fine set of extras, especially a history of the show with many many clips and a long, in-depth summary of every episode. It would take you many days to read and see all of that, so if you're a serious fan, you'll love that a lot, and the making-of/keeping it secret docs, commentaries, etc. It's a good package, and the film got a good transfer.If they make another movie, I hope they resurrect the old storyline, drop the blood and guts, and get on with what made the show great: quiet intelligence.",The X-Files TV Series
1237141,"""I want to die young in order to be a beautiful corpse"" is one of the key assertions of some writers of the Romantic literary movement. If Novalis died at the age of 29 and Heinrich Von Kleist at 34, on the contrary Victor Hugo died at the highly respectable age of 83. Some people don't manage to separate their ideal aspirations from real life, some do.

He is used to being the problem and figured he would take the fall instead of her.Some of the reviews talk about how ""scattered"", ""mopey"" ""dreadful"" or ""self centered"" this movie is, but I will tell you none of that!Freddie and Emma are wonderful actors who took a dreary, slow, somber script about coming of age as teens about to embark on a new path in life and gave it life!Freddie Highmore who we have all come to love in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Arthur and the Invisibles, August Rush, Finding Neverland is right up there with Dakota Fanning as far as acting chops. I cannot wait to see how far he does. He has grown into a tall child (5'10) and has border Zac Efron looks.Emma Roberts is Kristen Stewart without the awkwardness and quiet mannerisms.Freddie's George is a deep, thoughtful, smart boy who has way too much going on in his artistic head. The weight of his family life and his unsure movement into manhood creates a tornado of emotions that he doesn't have the tools to deal with. The secondary characters, especially in his school Blair Underwood, Alicia Silverstone, Jarloth Conroy are wonderful. My favorite moments of the movie were with his teachers and principles.I was sobbing in his last scene with Jarloth Conroy!Freddie is AMAZING so forget about all the other reviews and see this for what it is...a stepping stone of an amazing actor moving from children's movies into adult movies.",N/A

341894,"You already know about the film - It preys on nostalgia and enjoys taking its time with sweet, memorable characters that will especially resonate with those of us who went to the woods for camp as kids.  It's pure 90's in its style and aesthetic, save for the beautiful shots of the outdoors.So let's get technical and talk BluRay.  First, the DVD release of this film was poor in every regard.  It wasn't anamorphic, the coloring was off, and the ability to enjoy the film suffered as a result.  It was brought to life with very little care on the part of the manufacturer/distributor/whoever, as a VHS copy would have likely done the job just as well.  I blind bought the BluRay in hopes of at least an anamorphic transfer, but sort of half expected an up resolutioned version of the DVD that stretched to the corners of my widescreen television.Happily, the BluRay is a major leap ahead in terms of image quality.  It certainly isn't reference quality - you can stick to your Pixar films and modern day superhero films for that - but it  more than does the film justice.  There is surprising detail on the actors faces, and the beautiful shots of the lake and mountains look much better than previous home releases.  The film is also anamorphic and features a lossless 2 channel DTS-MA sound output.  If this were an action film, that wouldn't be ideal, but it's Indian Summer, a talkative film that relies on verbal and light physical humor - so it more than suffices.  Even Warner Bros slights many of their releases in the sound department with non-lossless BluRay soundtracks, so its nice to see a relatively unknown manufacturer put care into the films presentation in the visual and audio elements.No extra features to speak of on the disc, but the fact that we get a better than decent transfer of the film for the home theater is miracle enough.  At the budget price it comes listed at, this is a more than worthwhile purchase, especially for fans of the film.  And one minor note:  There is a review online from a major news source that bashes the films BluRay technical quality, but the review is either misguided or completely mistaken.  It appears as though the reviewer reviewed the DVD copy - which as stated above was poorly transferred to home viewing in every way.4 stars out of 5 simply for lack of extra features.  Highly recommended for fans of the film!",N/A
62454,"`One True Thing' is a familiar piece of family tensions that erode relationships only to reveal stronger connections and everlasting bonds.  It is handled with manipulative casualness, which strips away some of the honesty and gives it the appearance of heavy handed falsities.  `One True Thing' tries so hard that it loses the `true' part of the equation.  The performances are strong, especially from Zellweger, who undergoes some serious emotional shifts throughout the film, and she handles them with ease (she would have made a far more inspired Oscar nominee, as opposed to the always great but often over-nominated Streep).  Hurt is his usual self (with so much promise in the 80's, he fell into predictable shtick) and Streep tugs heartstrings with calculated fervor.  The thing is, when all is said and done, this film isn't memorable.  It just isn't a great movie.  I agree that the police angle was a misstep, but it wasn't the most grievous.  The film's internal tone just needed to be lifted from the obvious.  It is too apparent what the film wants you to feel, even within the plot manipulations that should read as honest twists (like with regard to Hurt's character and his apparent lack of concern); they come across too weighted down by the filmmakers intentions.  Insert scene, project sadness, receive bounteous tears; that is the whole objective of this film and it works well on that front, but when I walked away from the film I forgot most of what I felt because it never felt `real'.",One True Thing VHS

1355323,"I never got to see the entire series when it first ran on HBO, so to have the entire series (and the multitude of bonus features) on DVD is a delight.Many of the episodes that were collected for the ""Best of"" set a few years ago look a tiny bit different here:  on my widescreen TV those episodes have a tiny bit of what looks a VHS tracking glitch at the top of the frame.  That glitch is on several episodes but ONLY episodes that were in the ""Best of"" set.  Curious.And one can see a slight change in picture quality between those ""Best of"" episodes and the others, most noticeable on the title card.  It isn't enough to get one's underwear in a twist, but it is noticeable nonetheless.Does all that diminish the enjoyment of the series set?  Heck no.For a great many years, my all-time favorite movie or TV character was sales manager Herb Tarlek from ""WKRP in Cincinnati"".  He was a lovable loser.  Jeffrey Tambor's ""Hank Kingsley"" character from ""The Larry Sanders Show"" is posed to bump Tarlek down to second place  (Robert De Niro's ""Rupert Pupkin"" from ""The King of Comedy"" sits at third place and Daffy Duck at fourth.)The writing on ""The Larry Sanders Show"" is as sharp as it gets.  The line between reality and parody/satire can get very blurry sometimes.  They also take the occasional dig at Leno now and again, and that was back when he was still brand new at his ""Tonight Show"" gig and he wasn't very good at it.  The jokes are still relevant though because not much has changed since then.One of the staff writers (and occasional actors) on the show was John Riggi.  Riggi was a club comic for many years before getting the ""Sanders"" gig.  I saw him perform several times at a club in Memphis back in the 1980's.  I can even still remember some of his routine.  One was about caulk.Buy this DVD set.  As mindless as TV has largely become in the past several years, it is important to have something of quality in one's video library to remind you of how good TV can sometimes be when the right elements mix together.If you have this set and the complete set of HBO's ""The Wire"" in your home library, then you can stake a legitimate claim to having the best library on your block.Other reviewers here have complained of a glitch in a season 4 episode.

The robot, the infamous Ro-Man is charged with wiping out the one remaining family in the world, but somehow can't just go out his cave entrance and shoot at them cause he lives right by them. The movie is horrible, but the guys do a great job with it. The Commando Cody shorts are funny as well, as they always are.

Bela plays a mad scientist who has a place in the swamp complete with an octopus and an oversized dumb oaf played by Tor Johnson. Its the usual mess of an Ed Wood movie and the octopus attacks are just laughable. Joel and his bots do a great job making it more than passible. Also the Hired short is quite entertaining. Favorite Line: ""A big bald deranged kitten that can snap your neck like celery""Episode 818: Devil DollHere's a ventriloquist who has a dummy named Hugo that has a mind of its own. Also there's a guy investigating if this ventriloquist is involved in any of the murders that keep happening and there's a woman who has a lot of money and guess whose after it?

Favorite Line: ""I'm sweaty cause I was choking the puppet..... no wait""Episode 911: Devil FishThis schlock is a horrible boring piece of crap that has many Italians pretending to be Americans and doing the worst job of anyone I've seen in film.

1378501,"SPOILERS****1/2""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is a documentary about a documentarian, a film about filming.  At times, it's hard even to tell who's the subject of the film and who's the creator.  At some point in the movie, the street artist and the filmmaker switch roles, with the street artist becoming the filmmaker and the filmmaker becoming the street artist.  It's all very mind-blowing and Pirandellian, to say the least, but it sure makes for one hell of a clever and fascinating film.  A bit too clever, perhaps, for there are those who've accused the film of being a hoax, of being just an elaborate work of ""street art"" in its own right.Thierry Guetta is a French &eacute;migr&eacute; living in Los Angeles who has apparently recorded virtually every single moment of his adult life on videotape and film.  A few years into this obsession, Thierry began filming a number of underground ""street artists"" from various cities, as, under the cloak of darkness, they secretly created their works.  These included such well-known figures as Shepherd Fairey (he of the ubiquitous Obama poster) and Bansky, a British artist who had already established quite a reputation for himself in London.  But not only did Thierry film them doing their art, he frequently joined them in the process, often at great risk to his own freedom and safety.It is with Bansky that the movie begins to get truly mind-bending and complicated, for it is he who directed ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" not Thierry, yet he uses Thierry's footage.  So who is the actual maker of the film?  Who can say?  And what does that say about the fluidity of the creative process?  About blurring the line between art and its subject?  (To hide his identity, Bansky appears only in silhouette as he films himself giving interviews for the audience).  Then about halfway through the movie, we discover that Thierry has become a street artist (going by the appellation Mr. Brainwash) himself, sponsoring elaborate gallery shows displaying his own work.And as Thierry begins to achieve fame, fortune and international acclaim as the ""new Wharhol,"" we can't help noting the irony that an art form that originally sprang up as a subversive reaction against the Establishment has now gone full-board mainstream itself, earning millions for its pieces and high-profile celebrity for its artists.  No more furtive forays into the dead-of-night for this dude at least.If you're confused by all this, don't worry.  Even after seeing the film, I still cannot say I understand everything that takes place within it.  But that's just what makes ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" such a unique and trippy experience.  And besides, it offers a rare glimpse into a scene few of us have any real familiarity with, so whether the thing is real or fake doesn't really matter all that much in the end.  The ""experience"" is what counts with ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" and that, I guarantee you, will be unforgettable.",Exit Through The Gift Shop
336868,"This is a great, but uncomfortable film, about a deeply flawed man.  Dixon Steele.  Although he hasn't written a successful script for some time, is still a highly regarded writer.  He is also a revolving, 360 degree pig.  He is moody, self-centered with numerous flashes of violent anger.  Because, as we learn, Dix had some kind of unspecified military role during the War, we might conclude that Dix' personality is the product of PTSD.  That would be a far too superficial analysis of the labile, non-insightful Dix.A lovely young woman has been brutally murdered.  She is the same young woman Dix lured to his apartment the previous night on the pretext of her retelling and summarizing a book she's written and would like to see worked into the script of a film.  The whole thing--including the girl--is so shallow and dreary to the world-weary Dix that he tells her to find her own way home.  ""Here's some money for the taxi.""  He gallantly offers.The next morning Dix is picked up by the cops and interrogated.  On learning of the girl's death, Dix is neither frightened nor guilty about the fact that, by not seeing her safely home, he has inadvertently delivered her up to death.  Dix, as a matter of fact, is cool, calm, unflustered and uncaring.  He's even too stupid to recognize that his thoughtless behavior NECESSARILY puts him under the police microscope.  Let me emphasize that these are not PTSD symptoms.  They are symptoms of something far darker and deeper...something produced perhaps by twisted DNA.The woman Dix supposedly loves becomes increasingly frightened of her unpredictable paramour.  She doesn't know whether he's a murderer or not but she does know that he's explosive and dangerous.  She's caught in a classical 'abused woman' scenario.  She needs to get out...and get out now...before he kills her.I believe Bogart was at his very best when playing deeply flawed characters.

The acting is adequate but not inspired.  The dialogue is not bad, but not very memorable, either.  Gun fights and car chases go on far too long.  Although mostly entertaining, the running time at 2 hours, 20 minutes is about half an hour too long - we know that Dillinger will get shot outside a Chicago movie theater, so there's little suspense in the last half hour.

He did wonders for the Gamera franchise and brought Godzilla back from mediocrity. With a recent viewing of Gamera 3 on blu-ray, it has now become one of my favorite kaiju films of all-time. I threw myself into the story and was completely sucked in. The blu-ray looks incredible. Many of the close ups of Gamera have that HD pop to them which make them look three dimensional. But be warned, the flashbacks the girl has of Gamera are very creepy and weird showcasing him in black 'n white and with all-white eyes; you might even say it is a little disturbing to the point of possible scaring young children. But other than that, Gamera 3 is an incredible film on many fronts. Epic fights, nice CGI for Gyaos, nice story and a creative new monster (Iris). My favorite modern kaiju films are ""GMK-Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"", ""Gamera: Awakening Of Iris"", ""Long And Dark-Haired Monster Geharha"", ""Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: The Movie"", ""Negadon Monster From Mars"", ""Gamera The Brave"", ""Gamera: Advent Of Legion"", ""Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S."", ""Big Man Japan"" and I like ""Godzilla Final Wars"" but that film had a little too much cheese and over-the-top stuff in it; though I am a fan of Ryuhei Kitamura as well. ""Death Kappa"" and ""Demeking"" are just aweful. I haven't seen ""Deep Sea Monster Reigo"" yet. Monster mayhem films like ""The Host"", ""Cloverfield"", ""Super 8"", ""Monsters"", ""Troll Hunter"", ""The Mist"", ""Chaw"", ""Sector 7"" are always a blast too.",Gamera 3 - Revenge of Iris

1427089,"Rather than reviewing the show(if you're on this Amazon page, then you're most likely a Utena fan already and don't need a rehash of the plot), I'll get right to the actual details of the boxset itself.First of all, it looks gorgeous.  Inside a (very sturdy) carboard case(though it's too bad that it's a non-glossy paper), there are three slim dvd cases, each holding a single disc.  The covers show familiar Utena images(some of them were used for Central Park Media's original DVD releases), against a white background.  It gives a very classy look to the first set.Disc 1 holds episodes 1-4, and in terms of extras has these:  clean opening, clean closing #1, and a couple of Nozomi trailers. Disc 2 holds episodes 5-8, and has many more extras than the first disc.  They are: japanese cd box set tv spot(which is currently sadly out of print), japanese remastered dvd box set character tv spots, japansese remastered dvd box set 30 sec. tv spot, and more Nozomi trailers.Disc 3 of this release has episodes 9-12(meaning that ep.13(a.k.a. the recap episode) is going to be on Set 2).  For extras we have: rondo revolution tv spot, rondo revolution music video, and some more Nozomi trailers.The only criticism I have towards the DVDs, is that I would have liked the menus to have some animation(they are static, with Utena-related songs playing in the background).  To those who are wondering about the quality, don't worry.  I have the original Central Park Media DVDs, and this Nozomi release is a very big improvement.  If you're a fan of the dub, don't worry!  It's included.Whew.  I'm not done yet.  :)  The last, and in my opinion, the most interesting extra is the lengthy booklet included.  It was so awesome to read Kunihiko Ikuhara's episode commentary.  It's like a DVD commentary, not dull at all.  Here's a small sample of Ikuhara's comments:- "" ...no matter how bombastic I was, nobody understood me past the level of: ""It sounds like an eccentric show.""- ""Which scene is the climactic one?!"", I agonized.  Looking back on it now, maybe it was the part when Nanami slipped on the banana peel?""After this fun extra, you get even more.  First are Ikuhara's comments on the theme song(Rondo Revolution).  Then you get a 'making of' article on the making of the ending animation.  For those interested in the remastering process used on the Japanese editions and on Nozomi's release, you get interviews with the staff on the process.  There's also an article on the audio remastering, with staff interviews.We're not done yet!  There's an article called ""Revolutionary Girls"", on what exactly 'shojo' manga is like, and how Utena exemplifies it. There's a sketch art gallery.  Those sketches have a 'half finished' look to them, but are very pretty to look at nonetheless.The last article in the booklet are excerpts taken from the Japanese laser disc release. Very cool to read, especially for US fans, who otherwise might neversee these.",N/A

1129815,"So much marks this story as one of the very best of the latter years of Jon Pertwee's long run as the 3rd Doctor. The very first appearance of the feisty Sarah Jane Smith, an overly curious journalist who gets swept up in the Doctor's adventures here and by the time she leaves his company years later will have become one of the best-loved and most successful companions ever. The very first appearance of the Sontarans, who will later return to plague the Doctor many times in both the Classic and New series. The wonderfully believable Medieval setting, and Sarah Jane's incredulity about it after her first (and accidental) time traveling experience. And Jon Pertwee himself, at his swashbuckling, monster-fighting best.There's something ineffable about this story that I just love. And it's full of beautiful moments. The Doctor and Sarah in monks' habits sneaking into Irongron's fortress. The wonderful villain that is the Sontaran warrior Linx and his conversations with the brutal robber baron Irongron, both of them men of war and violence but in different ways. The thrilling action sequences. Sarah's mistrust initially of the Doctor, having only just met him. The scenes in Edward of Wessex' castle, sparkling with fine dialogue.This one's a charmer, make no mistake, and my favourite story of Season 11.",N/A
1380763,"Director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) has done some offbeat films but has always elicited strong performances from his leads.  Perhaps his greatest achievement is getting an Oscar worthy performance from Natalie Portman in Black Swan, a film that does an impressive job of depicting a psychological downward spiral of a competitive ballerina in the role of a lifetime.Nina Sayers (Portman) works hard at her craft and gets the coveted starring role in Swan Lake.  Doted on by her mother (Barbara Hershey in an unusual role) and pushed to extremes by her ballet director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), she begins to feel threatened and becomes delusional and loses touch with reality.  A new arrival, Lily (Mila Kunis), understudies her and becomes not only her friend and night scene companion, but also her main competitor and threat.  Is she undermining her on purpose or is Nina just imagining it all?  As opening night approached, the visions become even more disturbing to the point that Nina is at the brink of her sanity and the curtain opens on the most important moment of her life.Portman projects a complex series of conflicting emotions including anxiety, jealousy, and even guilt as if she does not deserve the lead.  Guided by Aronofsky, she soars as she has never done before.  Not only does she perform a substantial amount of physically demanding ballet, but we see things through her eyes and feel her pains. Does she really commit the horrible acts she thinks she may have done or is it all in her warped mind?  It's not a pleasant journey.  There is extremely disturbing use of mirror images that reflect Nina's face and become Lily in the next instant in jarring and unexpected fashion.  Is Nina seeing Lily or is it a reflection of her own self?  A moment that shows the various pieces of wall art at her home coming alive in nightmarish figures is truly unnerving.Kunis as Lily brings enough menace to her role.  Winona Ryder has a supporting role of a retiring, vindictive ballerina, Beth MacIntyre, who ends up in the hospital.  A scene where Nina worships Beth is reminiscent of Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in the dressing room scene of All About Eve.  Beth is bitter and even self abusive which kind of foreshadows what awaits Nina.  Cassell is effective as the ballet director whose sexism and unusual methods are suspect but never his quest for the absolute best for his production.  Hershey registers as an overly concerned, controlling mom.The film does a good job of showing the mental and physical toll that rehearsal and practice take on a performer, and to make matters worse, the angst exhibits itself seemingly on Nina's body in distorted and grotesque manifestations.  The physical mutations would probably amuse and please the likes of David Cronenberg and David Lynch.  As Leroy demands more than what she shows in technique, she knows she has to give everything in her soul and more to satisfy the ballet's demands.  There is an interesting dichotomy showing two sides of a ballerina's psyche with the repressed, uptight Nina whose frigidity is counterpointed by the free spirited and sensual Lily.  Lily evens brings out her sexuality and inner yearning that seems all too real, or is it a dream?  Something that is never mentioned or shown is if Nina is a virgin or ever had a real boyfriend.  Then there is the duality within Nina of White and Black Swans in which the dark side must emerge if she is to fully inhabit the lead role.Much of the film recalls other memorable films that bend reality like The Fight Club or Affliction, and Nina's descent into madness has striking similarities to Roman Polanski's classic Repulsion whose woman descends into psychological delusions and paranoia.Aronofsky's use of camera work is startling as it works in concert with Portman's performance, and when you see the change in her eyes near the end, it is stunning.  The film employs lots of handheld shots with cinematographer Matthew Libatique to visualize a subjective viewpoint for Nina.  The score by Clint Mansell is well done with a touch of foreboding.  Both of them are Aronofsky veterans.  The final scene as Nina readies to perform the last act as she morphs into the Black Swan to complete her transformation is haunting.  The final shot is unforgettable.  Some viewers may be turned off by its repellent imagery but others will be astonished by a powerful depiction of madness at any price.",Black Swan

Carrey is a toned-down version of himself, but if you're a fan you'll still find it plenty Carreyish. The script is familiar but pleasant, like the whole movie itself.All the standard moral lessons are achieved, family is the only thing that matters, etc (though having mega-millions for a 3,200 sq. foot Manhattan penthouse does help). As in Liar Liar, mean successful Jim becomes nice (and still successful) Jim, makes the kids love him again, gets back with the Mrs., learns his lesson, etc. If that's a spoiler for you, don't worry, you can see it coming from about one minute into the film.The alliteration of the P's has its moments, and there are enough decent laughs to make this worth watching for more than just the good family fun aspect. The penguin story is on the whole ridiculous, but that's what sells it.

These are the least of the families worries, however. Regular beatings aside, the family finds their routine shaken up when the eldest Montelli child starts rebelling. It turns out he is being possessed by some sort of demon and just when you think things couldn't get any worse, they get much worse. Much worse.""Amityville II: The Possession"" is a prequel to the 1979 semi-classic ""The Amityville Horror"" and is (very) loosely based on the DeFeo murders that took place in the famed house before the Lutz family moved in. The script, as penned by Tommy Lee Wallace, is about as brutal and dark as it can get. Just when you think the film won't go there, it goes there. We're talking children being treated violently, a relationship between brother and sister that goes too far and the worst offender of all: the farting priest. See the DVD at exactly the 26 minute mark for evidence.The first two thirds of the film set things up beautifully. The film is stylishly shot by Damiano Damiani, giving the film a visual edge over its predecessor. While the sequel comes very close to besting the first film, it unfortunately comes crumbling down in the third act. Without giving too much away, the main business is dealt with in the first hour, leaving the last forty minutes to just sort of dangle in the wind a bit. To quote Jerry Seinfeld, ""that's a pretty big matzo ball hanging out there."" Somehow the film becomes an odd amalgamation of the first film and ""The Exorcist"" and in doing so, does a great disservice to itself.When compared to the later installments in the series, this one at least comes out on top. In spite of its awkward ending, it's still a disturbing and thrilling ride that will take even the most jaded by surprise. Fans will get a thrill out of a story that takes things to the next level, while the average viewer will get a kick out of seeing Uncle Paulie himself, Burt Young, going off the deep end. Without a doubt, ""Amityville II: The Possession"" is a film you're not likely to forget anytime soon.",Amityville II: The Possession VHS
1178489,"Dark Floors (2008) is a Finnish supernatural horror thriller, that takes you on a weird journey through the wards of a hospital.  The story is atmospheric, and the special effects are mostly well executed, but the plot is slow moving, and a bit all over the place, as the characters make their way through what appears to be an alternate reality.  Director Pete Riski and Tomi Putaansuu, better known as ""Mr. Lordi"", came up with the story.  Lordi, and his four bandmates in the metal band Lordi, appear in the film as malevolent ghosts, demons, or monsters.A young girl named Sarah (Skye Bennett) is a patient in a hospital, and after an accident occurs while she is having an MRI, her father Ben (Noah Huntley), decides to take her home in the middle of the night.  Wheeling Sarah in a wheelchair, Ben enters an elevator on the eighth floor, as Emily (Dominique McElliot) a nurse, attempts to talk him out of leaving.  Riding down with several other passengers, something strange occurs and the car jerks to a stop.  Eventually the doors open on the sixth floor, which appears to be deserted.  The setting is quite eerie, as the group sees no one, until they encounter a woman with her eyes gouged out.Retreating in fear, they enter a stairwell, and move down one floor to the fifth, which is also deserted.  Acting as a group, these people are remarkably clueless, and Ben is continually losing track of his daughter.  When a ghost suddenly appears, Rick (Leon Herbet) a security guard, fires his gun with no effect, as the group heads down to the fourth floor.  Breaking from the pack, Jon (William Hope) attempts to take an elevator down, but is attacked and wounded by some kind of monster, before being rescued by the others.  It appears that Sarah is somehow the key to the strange events.  The survivors continue to work their way downwards to try and reach safety, but a deadly journey lies ahead for those who manage to stay alive.Dark Floors is a fantasy where anything can happen, but with a freehand to do almost anything, the direction the story takes is somewhat disappointing.  Even after seeing what they have seen, these people are trudging along with no sense of urgency to get out, seemingly unafraid for their lives.  Putting his daughter's life in the wrong hands, Ben is a guy with questionable judgment, and major problems maintaining focus on the task at hand.  Watching him gets to be increasingly frustrating, as he's painfully slow to react, and is kind of a bungler.  The film would be more effective if a solid emotional connection was established with Sarah, but she remains mostly a mystery, and a person that is difficult to really care about.  You might expect that some endearing quality might emerge about her, but it just doesn't happen.  While things seem to end well, it's hardly uplifting.Dark Floors is a slow moving atmospheric thriller with good production values, that for better or worse, features each of the members of the band Lordi to fairly good effect.  A reoccurring element involving loops in time, doesn't seem to add much to a story that is a more than a little obscure.",Dark Floors
994448,"Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa takes place two years after the end of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime series.  Edward is in the parallel world (which is Earth) in the year 1923, and he no longer can use his alchemy.  He is living in Munich, Germany, during the time period between World War I and World War II.  Edward is researching rocketry with Alfons Heiderich, in the hopes of being able to use rocketry to return to his own world.  Edward rescues a gypsy woman named Noah after she has been purchased.  It turns out Noah has an ability to read a person's mind by simply touching them.  A group called the Thule Society wants to use her to open a passageway to a place called Shamballa to get power and weapons to help Adolf Hitler take over the German government.Meanwhile, in Edward's world, an alchemy circle opens up with a group of fighters from Earth to test the gateway.  Al is able to help defeat this threat.  The Homunculus Wrath takes Al down to the city beneath Central City to the alchemy circle there.  The Homunculus Gluttony is there, and with Gluttony and Wrath, Al is able to open a portal to Earth.  What ends up being the repercussions of this action, and can Al and the others save the day?Overall, I thought there was a very interesting story presented in Conqueror of Shamballa.  There was also decent animation, except for a few shots where the 3D animation really didn't meld well with the 2D animation.  One of the worst uses of the 3D is early on in the film, when Ed and Alfons are riding in the cart with the gypsies.  There are some shots of the surrounding landscape, and it was decided to use 3D animation for the trees.  To me, the 3D really called too much attention to itself in these shots, and I thought the 3D wasn't really necessary to use for something like trees.There are five features included on this release.  The first is ""The Making of Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa,"" which is a 40-minute documentary.  It has Japanese audio with English subtitles, and it includes interviews with the director, you get to see some the drawings and promo items for Fullmetal Alchemist, and there is footage and explanation for the various steps of the production of the film.  Overall, I thought this was a rather enjoyable documentary.Next is ""Original Trailers.""  It includes one US trailer for the film, seven Japanese TV trailers, and the Japanese theatrical trailer.  For the Japanese trailers, they also included English subtitles.  ""Production Art"" is a slideshow that runs for one minute and fourteen seconds, and it includes character designs and backdrops.  However, the viewer has no control over when the images in the slideshow change; this is frustrating, since each slide is only up for about a couple of seconds before it moves on to the next one.  ""Image Gallery"" is another slideshow, which runs for one minute and thirty-five seconds and includes still frames from the film.  The disc also includes trailers for the Funimation Channel, Dragon Ball Z, Moonphase, Trinity Blood, Case Closed, Spiral, Lupin the 3rd, and the Z-Store.This is a film I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime series and wants to see how the story comes to an end.

517381,"Theses on AUCH ZWERGE HABEN KLEIN ANGEFANGEN (1969), a film directed by Werner Herzog1.) No film is more subversive, more revolutionary.2.) A film that goes wild, a world without a head. Midgets run amuck, perform an insurrection, razing buildings and trees to the ground. A Lilliputian assault: the dwarves take revenge on the tall people who once dominated them.3.) Not so much a film about violence as a cinematic act of violence against society.4.) A paedophobic nightmare: The children of the world revolt against the world of adults.5.) Reason's nightmare. Typewriters are smashed, telephone lines ripped down, flowers set ablaze. The revolt of the dwarves is a symbolic one: everything that is pure, everything that is sacred, everything that is dignified is brought down into the mud. Absolute de-rationalization, de-intellectualization, de-idealization. A camel---the symbol of piety, nobility, and grace---is repeatedly forced to kneel. A dwarf's psychotic laughter fills our ears. The revolt against reason. Social anarchy. The smashing of plates, the throwing of food. The end of all propriety. The absence of limits.6.) The viewer loses all sense of perspective, proportionality, and distance. Spectators are forced to identify with the dwarves. It is the world that has lost its balance; the dwarves are normal.7.) And yet the dwarves are nonetheless grotesque. The dwarves who massacre the pig are completely unsympathetic. Unsympathetic, and yet we are forced to identify with them. A reconceptualization of what it means to be human.8.) A corruption of the sacred, a besmirching of all that is holy. Ridiculing all that is pious. The inversion of all relations. The crucifixion of a monkey. One chicken cannibalizes another. A dead sow is fed upon by her piglets.9.) Meaninglessness, absolute infantilism, irrationality, chaos. But like the student rioters of May 1968, are the dwarves searching for a new master? One must take into account where the revolt takes place: an educational institution that resembles a penal colony. Public institutions demand their own infringement, their own violation.10.) A remake of Tod Browning's FREAKS (1932). We lock away the freaks, rejects, mutants of the world; they are the strangers, the foreigners, ""the Others."" But in this film, we the spectators have no sense of what we would usually consider ""the norm."" Are we not like the dwarves? Only a few steps away from being freaks ourselves. ""We will make her one of us, one of us, one of us..."" The nightmare of the normal people.11.) In a profound sense, the film is anti-humanist; the human animal appears as absolutely grotesque. The viewer loses his bearings: ""Am I large? Are they truly small?"" The world moves out of whack.12.) The subversion of logos, narrative, language.13.) Midget sexuality. The dwarves lust after tall women.14.) A real live homunculus gangbang, smashing a century of Hollywood cinema to pieces.Dr. Joseph Suglia",N/A

1447257,"I happened on Once Upon a Time by accident and the first two episodes had already aired. Once I watched the show I was certain of two things: This is a different take on fairy tales and someone needs to ramp up the acting.The biggest problem with putting across a show based on fairy tales is that the actors must be fully invested in the story and believe they are the characters they portray. Most of the acting is flat and uninspired and the actors' tongues are too prominent in their cheeks. Snow Falls came closer to what this show could be and I think that was because the actors have had a little more time in their parts.Snow Falls is a very different take on the Disney version of what happened to Snow White after the huntsman let her go and took a hart's heart back to the Evil Queen, and I don't remember reading in any version of the fairy tale that Snow White turned thief and terrorized the rich to keep for herself. That was unexpected and quite delightful. For the first time, I believed Snow White AKA Mary Margaret and that bodes well for the rest of the show.Emma is not nearly as surprising and tends to be flat and ho-hum about her part, even when cutting down the Mayor's apple tree. I wanted to see glee and a healthy shot of ""I can hurt you, too,"" coming from her and it just wasn't there. The most exciting part (a previous episode) was the long shot of the tree being cut.On the whole, the show is new and the actors not all that well known, which could play in their favor. Except for Rumpelstiltskin, who is devlishly demonic and gleeful, if not a little mad, the rest of the cast has a lot of work to do. Snow Falls was a step in the right direction and Snow White/Mary Margaret took the lead. Here's hoping the rest of the cast can muster their tongues out of their cheeks and get down to business with zest and zeal. I have my fingers crossed.",Once Upon a Time: Season 1

1360306,"So I'm starting here with that simple statement, I don't get it. And I just don't. I watched this series just released on DVD and found that I just didn't get the attraction or rave reviews the show has garnered. For a comedy show about a comedian I found it offered very few laughs.LOUISE tells the story of comedian Louie (played by Louis C.K.). Just divorced and a doting father, it tells of his everyday life and what happens in it. Some moments are touching, some funny and some just perplexing. But it's his life and so we watch what happens. We try to relate to the situations he finds himself in. And short of living in New York I don't think many people do find themselves in most of these situations.The series covers such topics as dating after divorce, trying to raise kids, having fights with your friends and more. Intermingled with the stories are a few comedic moments but for the most part each episode just feels dry and lacking something. Laughs perhaps?The series has received all sorts of accolades and comparisons to other series like CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM. I might be in the minority here but that's a series I've never seen. And if it's anything like this one I doubt I'd ever want to.So what is it about series like this that make people rush to praise them and talk about how wonderful they are? Why is it that shows concerning themselves with the miseries of someone trying to get on with life are entertaining? All I saw here was a man who had great friends but had trouble with a love life or a life at home. Isn't that the life that most people lead? Aren't we all having problems we have to confront and find solutions for daily? And if so and I'm living this, why would I find it entertaining watching someone else do what I do every day? Well I mean with the exception that I'm not making nearly as much money or on TV each week.I've seen Louis C.K.'s stand up act and know he can be quite entertaining and funny. But there's a difference between writing a stand up routine that is fine tuned over so many weeks on the road and trying to make up new jokes or funny antics on a weekly basis. The episodes I made it through here felt like they were one joke ideas that entire episodes were then built around. A single joke with plenty of filler. It would be as if a regular hamburger were placed on a Big Mac bun and covered with double toppings. Sure the meat was there but it was so covered by other items that you couldn't enjoy it.I don't know. Perhaps over time I will get what everyone else is saying about shows like these. Perhaps I won't want to. Until then I'll watch things that make me laugh, make me cry, keep me on the edge of my seat or make me jump out of it. As for now I think I'll pass by this one. You should too unless you like something so far off the wall that you can't even find that wall.I know I'll be raked over the coals by fans who adore the show as has happened to me before here. But the fact remains that not all comedy works for all people. Some may enjoy this while others don't. If you choose to give it a shot, then walk in with an open mind not swayed by my slam or by those who praise it. Make up your mind for yourself.",N/A

His character is terrific because he's a handsome, intelligent, shy gentleman who behaves like someone who has great upbringing, and he is in love with his friend who is a girl. I love that he spends most of the film trying to get her. I also love that Jake's character has a good relationship with his parents. And Jake's character treats the African lady with respect, which is rare seeing as how Africa and Africans are often portrayed as being primitive on TV and in movies. I also love that it's about global warming, which is a very serious issue!

1345175,"Based very loosely on the short story by Phillip K. Dick's short start the Adjustment Team, Adjustment Bureau is on it's own pretty much after the first 25 minutes//story wise story wise. You may know Dick's hand in the sci-fi hits as the classic Blade Runner and the not so classic Total Recall. But what they do have in common with Bureau like most of Phillip K. Dick's work there's one big mindfrak after another. This is a timely release after the success of the equally trippy ""Inception."" The premise of things not being what they seem mix with a unrequited and ill-fated romance that should never be, the romantic angle is where the short story stretches to feature length.  Matt Daemon's character learned the hard way that ""Sometimes Being early is just as bad as being late."" David Norris, a would be US senator, president even, brought back from the brink of ending his political career by a speech  inspired by a woman, Elise (Emily Blunt),who encouraged him to be more honest, later he meets her again on a bus he was ""fated"" to miss, he then arrives to a meeting on time but he witnesses situational ""fixers"" in stylish hats no human was meant to see. This is explained to his as is that he must never see the girl again, nor tell of the Bureau's existence. He is also told that ""the plan,"" made by someone they refer to as ""the Chairman"" must be followed. They warn Norris if he tells anyone he will be ""reset"", a personality lobotomy. Norris spends the next three years riding the same bus before finding the woman again, and he must risk threats that the two will lose their dreams as well as overcome the strange suited forces working to keep them apart with the advise and aid of his own bureau guardian angel Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie).The report between Matt and Emily is as fun and solid, even believable, as that between Matt and Mackie, the other suit ""antagonists have equally superb banter, especially Mr. Richardson (John Slattery) and Terrance Stamp as the Bureau's own Mr.Wolf-style fixer...

1293653,"** This review contains spoilers **I thought the Blair Witch Project was successful because the scares were dependent more on what you didn't see than on what you did.  Paranormal Activity is successful for the same reason.  Replacing blood and gore are strange sounds in the night, doors that open and close on their own, and other oddities.Even though, like the Blair Witch Project, I knew this wasn't real footage, it still had a definite creep factor to it.  I especially liked the scenes where the woman gets up in the middle of the night, stands at the foot of the bed and just stares at her boyfriend....for hours! It plays on that fear of the unknown - of not ever really knowing who your partner is lying next to you at night...of not knowing if they could ever turn on you.I also liked the progression of the hauntings in this film, too.  You see the entity testing how powerful it can be and then grows more confident as the story unfolds.  Again, this is successful because you don't see much...just shadows and moving objects...but is still successful because of that fear of the unknown - you don't know what this entity is that's haunting this couple.I would've liked more explanation on this entity, though.  Why did it track this woman since she was 8?  Why did it wait 'till now to get aggressive?  Why was it so threatened by her boyfriend?  Did it not like him because he was interferring...or was this really about getting to him the whole time?Answers to these questions would've given this movie more depth.I also would've liked a better ending, too.  Not that the ending was terrible, but was a little cheesy and gave away too much.  What made this movie so successful thus far was not giving away too much.If I had to change the ending, I still would've kept the part where the boyfriend goes downstairs, yells in fear, and then you hear a loud thump followed by silence.  The part I would've changed was what happens next -- after some time passed, it would've been cooler if the girlfriend had walked, or even crawled, through the bedroom doorway, looked up at the camera so we see her mouth and clothes covered in blood and then -- without the cheesy smile -- raised her hand up towards the camera and the camera tips over on it's own, ending the movie.That would be enough information to let you know what her powers were and how she killed him.Overall, though, I enjoyed watching this naturalistic type of horror story.",N/A
1333447,"Himura Kenshin is an ex-assassin, known as ""Hitokiri Battousai"" in the Meiji era. After having battled the Bakumatsu war ten years before, Kenshin now wanders around the country helping people to atone for his gruesome past and vows never to kill again. In the first episode of the series, Kaoru, a dojo instructor, stumbles across Kenshin and claims him of being the murderer that is killing the people of the village and ruining the reputation of the Kamiya Kasshin fighting technique. Later, the imposters are found out and justice is served. In the next few episodes, other main characters are introduced, including Yahiko, a child thief, and Sanosuke, an ex-fighting merchant. Season two's plot is mainly about Kenshin and his ex-enemy(for now at least) trying to stop the evil and powerful Shishio from conquering Japan. Season 3 is nothing too interesting besides some filler episodes with some minor bad guys thrown in.It's really a shame that this anime isn't more known - it deserves to stand along high in popularity with fellow classic shows like Inuyasha and Bleach. RK has a very deep and dark intricate plot with lots of action and drama. All of the main characters are worth liking (even the bad guys!). Season 1 was focused mainly on character development but the season following has one of the intensest episodes in the entire series. Some of the greatest sword scenes also are displayed in this season. The plot delves into each of the characters' minds and dark but hidden pasts and also explains how they got to be who they are.This show has amazing Japanese voice castings (not so much the dubbed, unfortunately). There wasn't a single character's voice in the subbed version that I didn't like. Also, this anime has some spectacular music - good thing there are a ton of soundtracks out with it! The graphics were good and of course, the swordfights were awesome as well.I recommend this to anyone who likes a good story, samurai and action, or historical Japan (and believe it or not, it does have some accurate historical lessons such as the Shinsengumi and Sekihoutai groups).",N/A
195564,"It is a strange twisting plot, but the acting of Foster and Lithgow is, as usually, excellent.The main reason I bought this movie is because Lithgow is in it , and I think Foster is one of the best. The music is great, and the whole experience is bizarre.I think she did a good job for what she had to work with, which was a pretty dull script. The costuming and sets were all pretty top notch, as was most of the acting. John Lithgow, who played her husband, did a good job, in that he gave me the creeps. There was pretty good chemistry between she and her brother in law, making you believe they could have a thing goin' on.An orphaned New Zealand girl married to an older, wealthy businessman learns to deal with his strange sexual desires.There are so many problems with Mesmerized, it is difficult to decide just where to begin with them. This was a very poor screenplay with stilted dialog, zero character development & the plot drags like a stubborn mule. To sum it up, this film is dull, slow-paced and pretentious. This movie suffered from poor cinematography with dulled-out color & poor lighting. Jody Foster also served as co-producer.Whatever happened behind the scenes with Mesmerized, it is clear that Jodie Foster bears culpability for much of this film's awfulness. She gave what was quite possibly the single worst performance in her acting career thus far. Throughout the entire movie, Foster's eyes have the glazed look that is so typical of cocaine users.. This is interesting in light of the fact that in December 1983, she was arrested and charged with possession of a small amount of cocaine. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year's probation and had to pay the costs of court.I really like Jody Foster but this is her worst. Don't waste your time or your money.",N/A
1422769,"The reigning queen of insult comedy has got to be Lisa Lampanelli. Brassy, bold and oh-so-naughty, Lampanelli rose to prominence with memorable performances on many of Comedy Central's celebrity roasts. The self proclaimed ""lovable Queen of Mean,"" she has been compared to Don Rickles and has a take-no-prisoners approach to comedy. With Lampanelli, there are no sacred cows--every topic is fodder for her humor. Political correctness goes out the window as she skewers everything from ethnic stereotypes to religion to vivid anatomical imagery. Even Lampanelli herself is a prime target for her own material, and I think it's this openness that makes her so likable and accessible even when she's being nasty!So why the lengthy introduction? Well, if you know Lisa Lampanelli then you know what to expect from her new comedic concert performance ""Tough Love.""  And she comes out of the gates swinging!  With the orchestra pit stacked with a diverse cross section of the public, she launches into an insanely funny dissection about what makes each fan in this group particularly unique and valuable.  We've certainly heard some of the jokes before, but she has such a vicious momentum that it all seems fresh and new.After being convinced that the entire concert was going to slay, however, things taper down by the middle section.  There is so much testicular humor, and it goes on for so long, that I was yearning for a complete change of topic.  When we finally get there, she revisits her attack on the audience--but now it plays as a bit of a rehash.  And in another big section, she roasts various celebrities that she thinks deserve the deluxe treatment.  A nice idea, but her targets are so easy--commonplace pop culture icons/jokes--that, while there are some funny lines, it just seems a tad obvious.Look, I love Lampanelli and she won't get a harsh word from me.  I'll just say that after busting a gut for the first part of her performance, things started to feel a bit familiar.  A solid set, overall, but not necessarily the stuff dreams are made of.

In the beginning, a high percentage of the underground were communists who initiated this fight in solidarity with the Soviet Union.IN this movie, the brave souls portrayed who were not born in France took up arms and fought - and died - to protect that country - even if it meant fighting against the French born collaborators.

926479,"On my quest to see every movie ever made, I've been catching up on some of the international films I've missed through the years. One of my absolute recent favorites was not a film I knew a lot about, although I was familiar with its actors. ""Brothers"" is a serious minded drama from Denmark. It stars Connie Nielsen who has enjoyed some English language success, most notably as the female lead in ""Gladiator."" The main cast is rounded out by Ulrich Thomsen from the brilliant ""The Celebration"" and Nikolaj Lie Kaas who was tremendous in Lars von Trier's ""The Idiots."" Not really knowing what to expect, I found this a powerful examination of love, war, and family--one that doesn't shy away from the emotional devastation that a war can create on the homefront.Set within a ""normal"" middle class family, Thomsen and Nielsen play a married couple with two daughters. Into their lives comes Kaas, as Thomsen's brother, a problematic character always on the wrong side of the law. Kind of the black sheep, he spends his days on liquor and women--no one expects much of him and that's what he consistently delivers. Thomsen, who is an Army major, is called to Afghanistan. Almost instantly, his copter is shot down and he is reported as dead. The loss pulls Nielsen and Kaas together as they struggle with grief and loneliness. Kaas ends up finding some real meaning to his life as he comes to terms with what is left behind. But not all is at it seems, as Thomsen has actually been taken prisoner and is alive.""Brothers"" then follows concurrent storylines--one in Afghanistan and one in Denmark. Both are beautifully executed. The atrocities of war are well documented and the psychological implications are well established. Thomsen is great as a man who has everything stripped away, even his humanity. At home, the film is a poignant look at the grieving process, familial commitment, and learning to start again. Nielsen is an absolute revelation. Having found her rather stiff in most things, she is light and natural here. She blends the many layers of her character with great affect. And Kaas has much charm. His character's evolution is satisfying and rewarding.As I mentioned earlier, I was a blank slate going into this film. But the movie resonates with real emotion and power. There is a realness to every situation, this is a true look at normal people caught up in a crisis. The heartbreak, rage, bitterness, jealousy, and shame displayed in the final acts provide bravado acting opportunities and searing emotional impact. I cared about these people, I wanted things to work out. But credit the film, again, for not taking an easy road--if tidy resolution is what you're after, this isn't the film for you. An incredibly moving, timely, and thought provoking experience. KGHarris, 01/07.",Brothers (2004)
1308295,"Min-Woo Hyung's ""Priest"" was a Korean manhwa about a gun-toting priest who sets out to defeat a gang of fallen angels bent on destroying the world.Now forget about that, because the movie ""Priest"" has absolutely nothing to do with the manhwa. Instead, this a generic vampire-slaying/rescue/revenge movie set in a completely generic dystopic future, with a choppy rushed story and painfully predictable writing. Paul Bettany is mildly cool, but we're never really given a reason to care about his character.It takes place in a dystopian future where vampires have... somehow turned the world into a desert wasteland, before being shut up in reservations. The only surviving authority is the Catholic Church, who trained vampire-slaying Priests to kill vampires -- but after the war, they were disbanded and are now shunned.Several years later, a small-town sheriff (Cam Gigandet) enters the walled city to ask the help of an unnamed Priest (Paul Bettany): the Priest's brother and sister-in-law have been murdered by vampires, and his niece has been captured. Against the orders of the Monsignor, he sets out to rescue his niece... but he doesn't know that she's in the grasp of an old enemy.Since it basically dumped the manhwa plot, ""Priest"" is cobbled together with bits of other movies: ""Blade II,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""Mad Max,"" a teeny bit of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and especially ""Solomon Kane."" And no, it's nowhere NEAR as much fun as any of the above films, even the horrible ones -- it's too bad to be enjoyable, but not nearly bad enough to be funny.And Scott Stewart is just AWFUL -- what else could you expect from the guy who made ""Legion""? Horrible dialogue (""I can smell the blood running through your veins. Smells like... dinner""), chaotic action scenes that might give you a seizure, and lots of unintentionally hilarious moments (usually the ones in slow-motion). I have to admit, the eyeless jagged-toothed vampires ARE a bit cool.But even a good director couldn't have made this mess anything but mediocre. There's barely a plot, lots of predictable ""twists,"" huge plot holes, and only some vague attempts at backstory. Everything feels like it was lazily slapped together without much thought, and Stewart just rushes on through as quickly as he can.Paul Bettany's character is as wooden as a plywood cross, and he's never really given any backstory or development to make us like him. He just drifts around in a quasi-religious, stone-faced haze of mild boredom. Gigandet is... okay; Maggie Q is pretty awesome as the buttkicking warrior Priestess, although I never understood why she was helping Bettany.As for Black Hat... aw, Karl Urban, why do you do this to me? I really like you, but you keep starring in horrible, horrible movies! In this one, Urban is basically a bad guy who doesn't even need a NAME -- he's just the Villain In The Black Hat who talks in a villainous whisper.""Priest"" is apparently this year's dark fantasy/horror/sci-fi stinker -- a clumsy, tedious mess cobbled together out of better movies. Maggie Q is basically the only reason to watch.",N/A

The story's general ending is never in any serious doubt.  Even the dialogue leans heavily on movies like Predator and Aliens.  But the action is like a roller-coaster ride.  Get yourself a bowl of popcorn, snuggle up on the couch with your main squeeze, and fasten your seat-belts.Oh, I almost forgot to mention, this movie has a seriously dislikable, backstabbing, weasel-of-an-officer you're going to love to hate.  Right from the opening scene of the movie you start to want this guy to buy it in the worst way.  Towards the end, you don't know who you want to see get waxed more; the weasel-officer, or the werewolves.  Maybe, just maybe, if you're really, really good...you won't have to choose.",N/A

1248450,"I saw this movie in the theater and got it again as a rental, and I'm still just not impressed. This plot has been done over and over and over again. The only difference was it had a lot of eye candy in it, including that cute, father cop who had an ""incident"" by the door. I think ""The Losers"" was far better and showcased Idris Elba's acting chops much more as a criminal/trying-to-be-good-guy-but-failing. I like to see Paul Walker in ANYTHING, but I wasn't even enthused about him in this film. Chris Brown's dialogue was weird for someone his age. Who says ""jazzed"" nowadays (or at all)? Michael Ealy was barely seen except being hostile to T.I.'s character, and T.I.'s character was too much like himself. The whole movie was ""Blah"" to me. If you want to see a good movie with better dialogue, better acting, a better scenario and some bonus laugh-out-loud moments, please see ""Losers.""

578428,"I can't find a more fitting time to review this movie then on the day of the ""final"" space shuttle launch.  I must say that I am rather dubious if this is really going to be the final launch, manly because in the realm of politics, economics and American government things are seldom absolute.Switching gears, this movie, ""Space Camp"" has an interesting story about when it was released.  This film was released only five months after the Challenger tragedy. I remember that day so clearly, January 28, 1986, I was eight years old and living in New Jersey.  My mother had a bad cold and I made her a PB & J sandwich.  I also made my first batch of tuna fish salad, watching something on TV I just didn't understand.I digress, when this movie was finally released, I don't think the public was ready to embrace the idea of a disaster and/or mishap adventures in outer space.  Now I just watched this movie for the first time last week.  I must say that it was an interesting watch, because I was laughing so hard I couldn't stand it.  I realize many people found charm and nostalgia in this film; I just found it totally harebrained, even by 1980s standards. First and foremost the fact that boys and girls in their late teens and early twenties being that stoked about space camp didn't seem very believable.Lea Thompson plays a girl who is hell bent on going into outer space.  No dreams of college, GRE/SAT scores, dating a cute boy or finding a job.  She wants to go into outer space, yeah that is the norm.Kelly Preston plays a Madonna/Debbie Gibson stunt double.  She really demonstrates some dualism, being both daft and brilliant.  For instance, she is an air head in social situations but can dissect aspects of space technology.Tate Donovan plays a guy whose father bought him a jeep; he can keep it as long as he completes space camp. Huh?Larry B. Scott plays a guy who wants to have fast food joints in space.Finally we have the character Max, played annoyingly by a young Joaquin Phoenix, is a twelve year old kid who is obsessed with Star Wars and is making references to it constantly. I love SW but became bored of all the alluding.  I began to wonder if George Lucas was paid permission for all the citations from the SW films.Kate Capshaw plays the teacher, who takes her job as a space camp instructor a bit too seriously.  Tom Skerritt, who has been in every movie, plays Capshaw's husband.Let's provide some lucid reasons why I found this movie to be an unintentional comedy.* In space camp it is wrong for an adolescent girl and boy to sneak off site to talk and neck.  Yet it is totally acceptable for Max to hide a 68 million dollar robot in his closet.* This same robot, name Jinx talks to NASA to send these kids into space.* This team of kids fail their flight simulation, resulting in death, but then is give the honor of sitting in a real space shuttle.* Space Camp students are put in a real space shuttle that is ready for launch.* When the shuttle takes off a random seagull flies across the screen.  Loved this part.* NASA is able to keep this rogue shuttle launch secret from the President of the United States.* The portrayal of how inept NASA is.* Kelly Preston performing the Morris Code for eleven hours.* Joaquin Phoenix floating in space.* Kate Capshaw being accosted by an oxygen tank.I could go on, but there is no point.  Overall I found this movie very enjoyable, not because it was a family film or a good film for that matter.  I found nostalgia in it, being that it was a film from the 1980s and it was so asinine it was a hoot.  My rating is strictly based off the B movie factor.  This movie is a total sign of the times, the Regan Era, the end of the cold war, the Space Program and sadly the Challenger.This film, believe it or not has some historical reference of an era that is long gone.  Under the assumption you have a twisted sense of humor, like me you will love this movie.  If you are looking for a low violence film to show the kiddies, this might be your cup of tea.  The DVD is bare bone, no special features.  So saddle up, grab your space suit, because in space camp you are going up!!!",N/A
1408480,"Rock Hudson found his feature film career basically over by the early 1970's. However, he was eventually cast in NBC's ""Mcmillan and Wife"", a mystery-themed telefilm that aired on a rotating basis with other made-for-TV movies like ""Columbo"" and ""McCloud"" on Sunday nights.""Mcmillan and Wife"" was really the inspiration for the Stephanie Powers/Robert Wagner vehicle ""Hart to Hart"" years later.The 90 minute telefilms dealt with Hudson playing a San Francisco police commissioner who solved mystery's like deaths and kidnappings alongside his young and vibrant wife played to perfection by Susan Saint James. Hudson would later claim that he hated doing the series/films because he felt the writing was terrible and the plots asinine, but he did it for sole economic purposes. Up until the day he died he and Saint James remained the closest of friends.In season three there were six telefilms made and the following are a list of those episodes along with their airdates.

1365416,"I wish I'd watched this movie sooner. Of course, I knew of the well-known actors in it, knew of the Academy nominations and wins, but for some reason I didn't catch it till its release through Redbox this week. ""The Fighter"" surpassed my expectations.Based on the true story of two small-town brothers, both boxers, ""The Fighter"" tells of Micky Ward, a welterweight fighter who got in the ring with Alturo Gatti three times. Although his will and heart became the stuff of legend, it's his struggles at home that make him interesting. His older brother, renowned in their town for having knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard, is now a crack addict whose life is being documented by HBO. While he fights his addictive and narcissistic ways, he also brings down his younger brother who has more realistic chances at a world championship.From Micky's relationship with Charlene, played with surprising toughness by Amy Adams, to his struggles with a controlling mother and interfering sisters, ""The Fighter"" ends up showing a lot of empathy for all involved. It is a story of triumph over one's background, one's personal demons, and co-dependency. It is a true ode to what it means to be a fighter in all areas, and Christian Bale deserved his Best Supporting Actor award, as did Melissa Leo her Best Supporting Actress nod. This ranks with ""Rocky"" as one of the great sports movies, for its heart, its honesty, and its tale of triumph over adversity.",N/A

We have multiple layers of meaning, doors of perception banging in the digital breeze, philosophical explorations of the outermost limits of inner space, but all of that is regularly put aside for wild rides on very fast motorcycles - or what the movie calls ''lightcycles''. It's a bit like Fast and Furious, directed by Stanley Kubrick on holiday.The Movie was great to watch and the story line was solid from  beginning to end for the movie.Trong Legacy is an incredible feat. Everything from the visual effects to the Daft Punk scored soundtrack and plot is amazing.

661800,"This made-for-TV movie is a strange beast; the only episode of Doctor Who to be co-produced by Americans, it attempted (and failed) to relaunch the series for a multinational audience in 1996. Thus, many Doctor Who fans regard this movie as a weird aberration - America's lone, tacky contribution to the Doctor Who mythos, sandwiched uncomfortably between the original and relaunched British versions.I don't quite share that negative view of this movie, however. As an American myself, I've always wanted to see Doctor Who take off in the U.S. - and this movie remains Who's only truly significant foray into the U.S. market. Such concerns aside, I also admire the movie for its slick production values and sense of fun. To me, this is still the best-looking Doctor Who production of all time, particularly in terms of sets (huge), extras (numerous), and direction (arty-farty).Certainly, Matthew Jacobs' often-convoluted script needed some work; if you compare it to ""Caves of Androzani"" or ""Midnight,"" you're bound to be disappointed. But I'd still rather watch this movie than, say, anything involving the Quarks or the Slitheen - if only for Paul McGann's charismatic performance as the Eighth Doctor, and his awesome TARDIS interior.But even for fans who hate the Doctor Who TV Movie, there should be no denying that this is a first-rate DVD package. The remastered movie itself looks and sounds great (why no Blu-ray version, I wonder?) But the real attraction is the huge array of special features. The longest is a documentary called ""The Seven Year Hitch"" about the movie's epic production history; though a little dry, it offers some compelling glimpses into the workings (and thought processes) of the BBC.Another standout feature (not listed on the back of the DVD, oddly enough) is Paul McGann's audition tapes; these are particularly interesting, because he reads from a totally different script from the one ultimately used for the movie. Other cool features include: special effects tests for CGI Daleks; a featurette on press coverage for the TV Movie; another featurette on how interest in post-cancellation Doctor Who was sustained by books, comics, and fan videos; and a fun roundtable discussion in which three nerdy fans talk about what they like (and dislike) in the movie.Overall, this is easily one of the best Doctor Who DVD releases, putting many Hollywood releases to shame; so even if you're lukewarm or hostile toward the movie itself, I'd consider picking it up.",Doctor Who: The Movie
833297,"There are always reasons to love and dislike films. However, some of them are borderline - we often do not know why a certain film is found appealing, or appalling. With this one the message is clear, its a tale of Russia's Hercules.The story with ""Ilya Murometz"" is such that there a few films that can depict a Russian Spirit, Russian Soul - and that I think is what the character of this ""bogatir"" (a tatar word meaning ""a stout, near perfection man, a hero"") is all  about. Ilya Murometz is a rural man, who is long paralyzed - with the help of travelling healers - he is healed and becomes a hero the world has never seen.The movie is colorful, playful and is just very enjoyable in its naivete. Plus I had revealed absolutely nothing of the storyline, which is pretty architypically complicated - we encouter Ilya's tender relationship with his parents, his son, his wife.

1414656,"Insidious is a movie that blends many different types of horror movies. It works for the most part. The movie is about a coupel with two kids, one of the kids goes into a coma. The doctors don't know when he will come out so they take him home only to have creepy events happen in their house. They come to find its not the house that haunted. The film starts slow with a very tense feel to it and this tone stays with the whole film. The director (James Wan) really builds suspense. The soundtrack whilst does have an orchestra at times, uses mostly organic sounds to give the movie a heartbeat one example there is a grandfather clock that has a beat that builds more suspense than orchestras.The acting is strong and believable. The movie is one of a new trend of horror movies that has a very low budget, making the director use his imagination. Paranormal Activity started this popular trend and Insidious borrows form the feel of it. After 30 minutes of this, the movie switches from the Paranormal Activity routes to a more original feel that many may be lost on, but It gives the movie a fresh take and separates it from other house haunting movies. The movie is a rare PG-13 movie that people enjoyed. It has zero gore, but replaces it with many well built jump scares. With a little more development in the last act this movie could have been amazing, but I still enjoyed it and it made me jump a few times which I hardly do.",Insidious

198732,"Even though this film varies drastically from its source material (Frankenstein (Book, 1818)) it still manages to be both frightening and entertaining. The movie follows Henry Frankenstein who is engaged to a girl named Elizabeth. He leaves his fianc&eacute;e for four months to work on an experiment with his assistant Fritz. His experiment is to revive a dead corpse but since he is unable to find a perfectly healthy human corpse (they had to have had something wrong with them if they died after all) he ends up grave digging and putting all of the pieces together to create ""The Monster"". When he succeeds in giving it life the Monster manages to escape and cause trouble throughout the entire countryside, killing at will. Will anyone be able to stop the monster? So basically the story is very good although it hardly follows the novel at all, even changing the main characters name from Victor to Henry (yet they named a minor character Victor to add to the confusion). The Monster's intelligence is also drastically brought down to the point where he can't even speak. The main loss though is the fact that the good guy/bad guy relationship is much more black and white. In the original novel it was open to interpretation but here the Monster is clearly bad with Henry being good. So the story is very entertaining, but also a missed opportunity.When it comes to the acting in this film I truly feel that all of the actors did a great job in their roles. Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein and really pulls off the mad scientist vibe really well. Then there is Mae Clarke who plays Elizabeth but the script doesn't give her very much room as it makes her out as the damsel in distress. Keeping that in mind though she pulls it off well. And next up is Dwight Frye as Fritz, often incorrectly called Igor by viewers. Frye is great as the crazy and stupid hunchbacked character. Most importantly we have Boris Karloff in the film that raised him into star dome. Even though he is covered in makeup and doesn't have a single line of dialogue he manages to be the best actor in this film. He really helps the audience sympathize with his character but at the same time manages to be the angry evil monster. So overall there is some great acting here.All of the makeup and special effects are excellent here with some realistic looking wounds and decomposition on the corpse of the Monster. In addition there are some great sets in the film which truly set the mood with the exception of the final scenes where the Monster is being chased on a mountain which looks somewhat fake. And as for the musical score it complements the picture tremendously. Frankenstein is a very technically sound film overall.As a classic of the horror genre at the time and one of the most famous monster movies ever made I was slightly disappointed with the film. I am a huge fan of the original novel and was disappointed that so few elements transferred over to the movie but nevertheless it is still an excellent monster movie and one that is worth your time. It is very good technically with excellent special effects, sets, and music plus it has some great acting especially from Boris Karloff as the Monster. So give this film a try if you have any interest whatsoever in monster movies, horror, or Frankenstein. But don't expect it to be anything like the book.Score: 8/10",N/A

It is set in the future, with futuristic weapons and means of travel.  Everything that qualifies for a Sci-Fi flick.  Pandorum contains action and a ever so evolving plot.

1293149,"If you have any experience with a large corporation as of late, Up In The Air is a film that may make you squirm with emotional discomfort. The recognition of the cold, unresponsive attitude of upper management driven to have greater profits at the expense of a loyal work force seen only as ""inventory"" is almost too much to watch. Up In The Air is character driven, and the thin story is played out through those experiences.I both loved and hated this film. The knowledge that Clooney's charming and handsome portrayal of a corporate hatchet person was just that -- charming and handsome -- did nothing, for me, to soften the ultimate recognition that these positions are often filled by sociopaths who glory in the opportunity to damage others. Jason Bateman's cavalier approach to this business was perfection as he found new and more damaging ways to suck more profits from his trade.I could not help but view Up In The Air through a lens of current financial and corporate reality, and the experiences of friends and family around me.

1394841,"Let me say this from the start: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a quantum leap improvement over its wretched predecessor (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition).  Featuring a comprehensible story that flows logically, some solid acting from Shia LaBeouf (in top form as the hyper Sam Witwicky), Peter Cullen (who IS Optimus Prime), John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and Patrick Dempsey, and top-notch special effects, it is a fun ride that is very enjoyable to watch.In fact, if someone stopped the movie after the first half, I would have said that it was THE best of the three movies by far.  (Minor spoilers ahead) Transformers: DOTM takes a risk in its opening scenes by deciding to jump into conspiracy theory territory with its assertion that the Apollo lunar program was designed to get NASA astronauts to the moon to investigate an alien crash landing, but the risk pays off marvelously as the film masterfully interweaves news footage of the lunar landing with the mysterious discovery of a crashed Transformer spacecraft.  This spacecraft (The Ark), as it turns out, contains Sentinel Prime (voiced by the always excellent Leonard Nimoy), former leader of the Autobots, in stasis.  Sentinel, in turn, is the only Transformer who can activate a device that could not only unleash an army of Decepticon warriors on Earth, but even end life as we know it.  The movie contains some nice plot twists and double crosses that I will not get into here, but all in all, it has a solid plot on par with the first film.  Visits from likeable characters from the previous films- Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), Agent Simmons (John Turturro), Lt. Colonel Lennox (Josh Duhamel), and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are very welcome.Oh, and for those who were wondering if Megan Fox could be replaced, YES she can.  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, besides featuring her obvious beauty and attractiveness, acquits herself quite nicely in her first movie.  Will she be winning an Oscar from this film?  Of course not, but let's face it: the script uses her mostly as eye candy, but she admirably rises above that as Sam's likeable and sweet new girlfriend.Where the movie loses a point, and thus falls behind the first movie (Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition)IMHO, is in the second half, when the Autobots and Decepticons engage in a battle royale, winner-take-all struggle in Chicago.  It is at this point in the movie that you can almost sense that the script has been barely holding Director Michael Bay back like a rabid attack dog on a leash.  Once we get to Chicago, the leash is dropped and Bay ferociously attacks the viewer with a special effects assault unlike anything seen before.  Now, the effects are UNDENIABLY impressive.  The 2007 original film featured very impressive effects, and it is surprising how much they have improved in four years time.  Autobots and Decepticons destroy humans, buildings, and each other in a dazzling display of digital imagery.  The mistake Director Bay makes is failing to heed an important lesson: LESS IS MORE.  By having frame after frame after frame of shooting, explosions, carnage, and mayhem, eventually I became numb to the special effects and they lost some of their punch.(Also, a word of warning to those who go see the movie in 3D- eat your popcorn/munchies before the battle in Chicago.  Besides numbing, I found the all-out special effects extravaganza to be slightly nauseating with the non-stop motion, loud noise, and explosions.)In short, the movie would have been better if the Chicago battle was cut in half.  I cannot believe that SOMEONE- one of the editors or Executive Producer Steven Spielberg, for example- did not urge Bay to cut back on the special effects-laden climax (although in fairness, perhaps they did and were overruled by Bay, who is clearly in love with his digital toys that he can blow up).  Bay is a talented director to be sure, but the movie would have been better served if he had allowed the viewer to breathe from time to time in the second half.So what we're left with is a fun summer, popcorn movie that I will be excited to add to my DVD collection right next to the first movie, and is a good end to the trilogy.  The new movie - wisely - ignores the second movie almost completely, so I think Transformers fans can be proud to have the first and third movies on their shelf and pretend the second one never happened.  Both Director Bay and Shia LaBeouf have stated that this is their last Transformers movie.  That may be for the best.  I would be excited to see what a director like J.J. Abrams - or even Steven Spielberg himself- could do with a Transformers reboot.  A movie that balanced character development, plot, and the JUDICIOUS use of special effects would give us the Optimus Prime of Transformers movies.",Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon

She plays Beverly Sutphin, a Baltimore housewife who has secretly gone off the deep end and become a serial killer. But she's a serial killer you can kind of get behind.

238145,"First off, this is a much better movie than you would think by just looking at the cast and production.Yes, essentially this is a wartime romance with all the tear jerky stuff you would expect. (which I happen to enjoy too) But, and this is where things take a turn toward the interesting, this film properly portrays several elements of the US military during the Vietnam War. Including what I consider an incredibly detailed Navy Seal Ops unit, both in characterization and temperament. It borders on the bizarre that such a nugget of special ops combat would be hidden inside a romantic flick.Their mission, of course, is based on the real life US Army Special Forces rescue operation/raid on Son Tay Prison. But the effect is amazing. A sort of ""what if"" had the Navy been tasked with the rescue.Additionally, the hilltop firebase and field hospital scenes were again surprisingly realistic. As well as the actions of the personnel on the naval hospital ship. I'm not sure who the advisors to the movie were, but their on-hand knowledge were well used by both the director and cinematographer.This was at the height of star Ken Wahl's career - so it comes as a sad reminder of careers that 'could-have-been'. The acting is well done and the romance with beautiful Cheryl Ladd very tangible.Finally, kudos to Lane Smith who portrays the by-the-book Navy doctor, Commander Markel - and R. Lee Ermey as the Marine Gunnery Sergeant. Not surprisingly R. Lee wasn't stretching his acting muscles too much since he is in fact a globe-n-anchor combat vet who did multiple tours in Nam.",N/A

786999,"Perhaps one of the most interesting points of this DVD is the closing remarks where it is said that a lot of the information of this film could not be authenticated therefore it is left to viewer's discretion.  People are tired of character and reputation damaging ridicule, scorn, and of being dismissed as idiots and wanna-be fakers of allegedly trying to make possible for ourselves the big time benefits of fame, fortune, and being remembered for something unique and individual about ourselves.  Who is qualified to decide whether or not somebody deserves the positive reward they seek?  Community, family, social assemblies, academic pursuits, career environments, religious participation, private and/or public situations are all frontiers of human experience where each of us having subjected ourselves to them in one way or another, formulate anticipated return analysis so that we can be objective about our perspective and decide at what level we wish to continue submitting ourselves in that area of self-compromise.  Therefore, we tend to add disclaimers, loopholes, and escape clauses whenever we reduce our thoughts to writing so that our dreams don't end up replaced by regrets and so we are not incarcerated as those who need cleansed from society by permanent capital purging.  Nobody wants to commit themselves to culpability, responsibility, and/or expose themselves to the negative consequences of society's decision as to right or wrong these days; and given the ease of ability for research and the inherent reality that there is no end to ""experts"" on either side of any debate, many of us hesitate to offer any suggestion of any kind - to anybody.  Physically, spiritually, mentally, emotionally, financially, and esoterically, we all aspire to being given recognition, validation, significance, and to sense our own above average worth through tangible compensation of some type.  We all wish to be given (even if merely articulated) accolades of reward for performance, achievement, skills, experience, creativity, education, talent, motivation, integrity, honesty, ambition, and other arenas of excellence - real or imagined.  In fact, it is later in life many of us realize we will never be afforded opportunities, breaks, given a chance, or even have dumb luck let us fall into a position of fate providing us the better life and greater happiness that seems to elude us; unless we become convinced overwhelmingly that we can only achieve these vicariously.  It has been said that to find success you must have several connections and networks with people who WANT you to succeed, without which no amount of human effort can remove the foot of power off of the back of our neck.  Some people turn to chemical addiction, some to perversions and vice, and others turn to worship of some other thing or individual they consider higher than themselves - some other individual that has achieved what they themselves cannot (an example are extreme spectator level fans of professional sports, another example is the followings amassed by televangelists who bilk the multitudes out of life savings so that religious icon can live as though they were a peer to senators and congressional representatives who want us to believe they are public servants).  ""Out Of The Blue"" is a documentary for those of us who have come to realize we need something beyond above mentioned individually achieved independent routes for escape from our otherwise meaningless lives, and who look for that escape through any and all possible resources that lack legal consequences of the negative variety.  I doubt seriously if alien abduction would end up quite like most of us hope for, and unfortunately the genre of Sci-Fi fuels the nostalgic sentimentalization of what potential there is for wonderful and beautiful experiences beyond this earthly existence otherwise referred to as the ""rat race"" of working a thankless job and striving toward keeping your children out of prison or off of death row for being unable to adhere to irresistibly imposed requirements for social conduct and tolerance at the individual level (not found in larger society, groups, or committees).  If you believe that sitting in a chair for 40 years all by itself without further aggregate contribution gives you seniority rights of rank, privilege, and honor that negate any less senior peer regardless of the latter's education, performance, achievement, skills, experience, talent, motivation, honesty, creativity, ambition, integrity, honesty, or other allegedly superior characteristics, then you will criticize ""Out Of The Blue"" as being nothing but crap.  If you're not one of the cronies reaping benefits of being pandered to, then you might enjoy the potential this DVD suggests as frontiers for alternative human experience than what we've been exposed to so far.  If you are among those who fear a bit of metaphoric chlorine in the gene pool, then you won't be interested either.  ""Out Of The Blue"" held my attention for 2 hours and 35 minutes, and I would comment that they offer above average information on the subject of extraterrestrial life as being at least possible, especially since it is presented as being a documentary.  Released 2004, Hannover House studios, directed by James Fox, and narrated by Peter Coyote.  I like the presentation style, I like the sincerity of presentation, and I like how it doesn't keep repeating itself to fill up an allotted time requirement to justify being a documentary.  But there are more up-to-date films, photos, and interviews available.  I felt like this was presented by people who only consider the previous fifty or sixty years of information as viable, without regard to what has been happening in the last five years.  I was disappointed that all we got was whatever has been declassified due to the age of the information.  It is like waiting for the Vatican to release archeological discoveries that have information which challenges modern day thinking.  If I am to believe in UFO's and extra-terrestrial life, I don't want the history without the present.

Given that, I fell hook, line, and sinker for this new overpriced 3 disc set from Timeless ""Authorized By The Gene Autry Estate.""Gene Autry did not produce or own exclusive rights to this public domain serial.  This set claims to use as a source his own personal print.  For $35, I expected it to shoot the moon.  Not so fast, though.  Gene's ""personal copy"" was evidently a 16mm print, because that's what this looks to be sourced from.  No cleanup to image or sound has been done.  Dirt, scratches, and other trash are apparent throughout.  Timeless, not one of my favorite distributors (remember those great old Universal TV shows they licensed, and used horrible 16mm syndication prints as sources, e.g. Checkmate)?I'm sure that Autry's agents forced Timeless to spread this 12-chapter serial over 3 platters to avoid over-compression, with the best possible intentions.  No restoration or cleanup has been done.  Sad.The Serial Squadron sells a version of EMPIRE through their site, which is superior to this.  Also, VCI has their own version out that looks pretty good.  Nothing will ever be perfect for this title unless a first generation source can be found, and that's unlikely to happen.  The folks at Serial Squadron did clean up their version digitally and certainly looks the best.So, if you have either the VCI or Serial Squadron versions, you can't do much better by them.  Timeless' price is ridiculous for what you get.  The only supplement to amount to anything is a brief intro done for Autry's Melody Ranch Theater syndicated TV show that ran his films.

It just so happens that there are several cars of a toxic substance on the runaway train.Denzel Washington plays a veteran train engineer (of 28 years I think) who knows the tricks of the trade that you cannot find in books.  Chris Pine (of Star Trek) plays a young conductor.Realistically, I don't know why they could not have fixed the situation earlier in the movie, except that it was written in the script that way.

1396577,"No, not every detail of the series is perfectly accurate, but it gets most of the major details behind ""The Jackal's"" life correct while keeping the viewer's interest high. The action of the series is good enough to please those looking for a political-thriller and historically steeped enough to please the cold war history buffs like myself. It begins with the raid on OPEC that made Carlos famous. As a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Carlos led a small band of guerillas on a mission that would later result in Carlo's expulsion from the PFLP and propel him through various stages of rebellion.The acting is generally good, although the make-up artists tried far too hard to make Carlos, physically, look like Che Guevara, and the plot points thoroughly investigate the major events of the man's life. Of course Carlos, the real Carlos who will spend the rest of his life in prison, didn't think he was portrayed all too well, saying the piece was guilty of ""deliberate falsifications of history, and lies"", and threatened legal action to stop its release. In the end Carlos turns out to be a rebel of all sorts: jumping from Marxist, to Palestinian freedom fighter, to his current theoretical commitment, Islamic fundamentalist. From Marx to Bin Laden? From opiate of the masses to heroin addict? I just don't buy it. In the end Carlos is a political opportunist with a bit of a megalomaniac complex; he simply adopts whatever rebellious doctrine is dominate at the time in the hopes of being propelled to the forefront of the movement; some men are just power hungry. This series is well worth the watch, but make sure you watch the series and spare yourself the lengthy film.","Carlos the Jackal [UK import, Region 2 PAL format]"

While the series has been synonymous with the terms ""overrated"" and ""pretentious"" at times, that's not to say that such things are completely true. Partially, maybe, but not completely.I first watched the movie subbed (and in not the best of quality), having to sort through all the technobabble I was reading from the subtitles and piece together a story, resulting in not the best of experiences for me. That said, watching it dubbed made things significantly easier to follow on my part. Though, at the end of the day, both versions are essentially the same, the dub keeping as close to the original Japanese script as possible, while taking some liberties here and there for the sake of better expressing the characters for English-speaking audiences (ie: expressing Mari's character through stronger swears).As for the story itself, I am glad that things are finally stemming away from the original 26-episode series. The problem I had with the first ""Rebuild"" movie was how close it stuck to the scenes in the original anime, while keeping the pacing rather slow, especially during the sluggish buildup to the climax. This time around, we get a good mix of old material and new material, keeping oldentime fans as well as newbies on their toes as to just exactly what will happen next.And if the movie itself wasn't enough, the special features will definitely warrant the buy. Not only is there an audio commentary for the movie, but original Japanese trailers for the movie and DVD release, deleted scenes, and additional behind the scenes work, showing scenes as the make it from the drawing board to animated form. One minor complaint would be the inclusion of a ""play all"" option for the trailers, but not for other features, such as the deleted scenes. Being sent back to the main menu after 2 or so minutes only to select another 2 minute clip can be a pain after a while.The picture quality is also excellent--one of the few animated movies that deserves to be seen in high definition, what with its mix of 3D-style animation alongside detailed 2D backgrounds.

I expect a lot of plausible, realistic (for a movie) fighting that looks bone-crunchingly painful.Ong Bak 3 has minimal fighting, and is more like a crappy Asian drama with no cohesion that just happens to have some fight scenes in it.  For the majority of the few fight scenes that do happen, there is use of wires and CG.  The reason Ong Bak 1 and 2 were so good is because they didn't include that crap.  There is one fight involving the Crow character from the end of Ong Bak 2 vs. a bunch of lackeys, and the wire jumps and CG make it plodding and unimmersive.It also seems like the director was trying too hard to be ""cinematic"".  Many parts of the movie just feel cheesy, and it is extremely apparent you are watching a movie.  When watching Ong-Bak 1 & 2, I felt like I was witnessing a story, not watching a movie.  I got absorbed into Ong Bak 1 & 2, but not 3.Overall, the fight scenes feel very weak.  The first fight scene is conceptually cool (I won't say much about it in case you do watch the film), and the second to last fight is the only real stellar fight.  That scene is Tony Jaa in his element:  No wires or CG, restrained & non-intrusive use of slow-mo, and furious combat against many foes.  Frankly, it's the only reason I didn't give the movie 1 star.TL;DR - The movie is more like an over-the-top asian drama, with quite a few moments of ""Aw, that's B.S"" weak supernatural storytelling.

In fact, I had only seen the original 1996Mission: Impossibleprior to this viewing and heard rumors that the two previous sequels in 2000 and 2006 were simply retreads of the first movie, which was in itself a reimagining of the popular 1960's TV series, granted an extravagant, multi-million-dollar reimagining directed by Brian DePalma. This one showcases an older yet still agile Tom Cruise returning to the role of intrepid IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and even as he closes in on fifty, he demonstrates the same unparalleled commitment to dangerous, high-flying derring-do he displayed in the first one fifteen years ago. This time, the reins have been handed over to Brad Bird who makes his live-action directorial debut after scoring with a couple of Pixar's megahits,The IncrediblesandRatatouille. The results are fortuitous because Bird brings great visual flair to a film that demands gasp-worthy action sequences.In fact, the action is so propulsive that the convoluted plot takes a decided backseat. Written by Andr&eacute; Nemec and Josh Appelbaum, the story feels like a throwback to the days of Soviet spy-versus-spy intrigue and A-bomb secrets.

He is so feared that Hunt has to be sprung from a Russian prison where it is unclear why he is incarcerated until the very end of the film. A small IMF team has been assigned the duty, consisting of sultry but tough Jane Carter, tech wizard Benji Dunn, and unexpectedly, the IMF Secretary's chief analyst William Brandt. They need to track down a French assassin for hire who has already killed one of their own in cold blood for the briefcase. The team ends up in the Kremlin where their plans go fatally awry. The CIA points the finger at the IMF team for the disaster and invokes the dreaded Ghost Protocol.The now-rogue agents make their way to the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, where Hunt has to scale the outside of the building to manipulate the building's computer system. A botched transaction with the assassin leads to mayhem and then a final stop in Mumbai where there is the inevitable race against the clock to save the world. The movie is really all about the set pieces - the Russian prison escape, the Kremlin break-in and explosion (an excellent special effect), Hunt's gravity-defying climb in Dubai and an overwhelming sandstorm, and the movable multi-level parking lot in Mumbai which sets that stage for the final showdown. Performance are secondary in this kind of movie, but they are mostly workmanlike. Cruise is inarguably in his element as an action hero, and he appears to perform most of his death-defying stunts.  Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) also shows the necessary chops as the initially mysterious Brandt, and it is clear he will be playing a larger role in the next installment.Paula Patton, a long way from the inspirational teacher she played inPrecious, brings the requisite sexy strength to Carter, in particular, in a no-holds-barred fight scene with the assassin played by L&eacute;a Seydoux (whom I was surprised to discover is the same actress who played the shy antiques dealer inMidnight in Paris). Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz) initially tries too hard for laughs as Dunn until he finally settles into the film's more tongue-in-cheek tone. Michael Nyqvist only has to convey relentless menace as Hendricks, which he does just fine. Anil Kapoor (Slumdog Millionaire) shows up as a wealthy Indian tycoon, as does Tom Wilkinson quite briefly as the IMF Secretary. The actor who plays the Russian intelligence operative, Vladimir Mashkov, bears such a striking resemblance to SNL's Fred Armisen that for the longest time, I thought it was Armisen in an impressive change-of-pace. Veteran cinematographer Robert Elswit (There Will Be Blood) does excellent camerawork in the various locales - Budapest, Moscow, Dubai and Mumbai. Fans of the franchise shouldn't be disappointed.",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol
337900,"My son is 7 years old and loves the 3 Mummy movies- that is: the Mummy, the Mummy Returns, and Dragon Emperors Tomb.  He loves the almost constant action- he skips those scenes where characters talk.  What has this to do with the 1958 Christopher Lee The Mummy?  Almost everything.  While a sub plot(?) of 1999 Mummy is Imhotep trying to raise his lover, Christopher Lee's Mummy, I think, directly focuses on the tragedy of the forbidden love Kharis (Christopher Lee) had/has for his Princess Anunka and the depths he will go to to raise her from the dead.  Christopher Lee doesn't speak because he- like Imhotep- has had his tongue cut from his mouth and can only communicate with his eyes and other body language.  Christopher Lee is brilliant.  He makes his audience almost feel sorry for him.  But, alas, Kharis must die- again.  The Mummy is one of Hammer's best.  I highly recommend it. And what of my son?  He was fascinated with the Field Museum's Ancient Egypt exhibit.  While watching the new Mummy for the 15th or 16th time said: ""Dad, I want to go to Egypt.""  Am I raising a future Egyptologist?

After all, I loved the series and the first movie. I should have listened to everyone I talked to about this movie.IT WAS HORRIBLE! So bad. Oh, man was it bad. The only thing I found funny was when Charlotte said something about not wanting to lose the nanny.The movie went by so slow and I was thinking ""when will this be over!?"" throughout most of the movie.Too many bad puns. Jokes fell flat. And I didn't really like any of them. They weren't themselves. I'm just going to act like this movie never existed.",N/A
1393888,"If there's one man in Hollywood who knows how to create a ruckus, it's....uh, Robin Williams.  But if there's one DIRECTOR who knows how to consistently bring sequential chaos to his films, it's Jay Roach.  The man behind the Austin Powers and Meet the Parents trilogies, Roach's talents are the pinnacle of persistent, albeit uneducated, humor.  There's nothing sophisticated about him, but it's difficult to stand by idly and maintain a flat face during pandemonium that is rivaled only by vintage Python.During this (dinner) party, you'll feel stupid.  Let's just get that out of the way immediately.  There are no high brow comedic moments to be found in Dinner for Schmucks.  It sticks to its slapstick strengths, and doesn't wander more than a few steps from said territory throughout.This is a film that is absolutely determined to make you laugh by its principles, and will fight tooth and nail to assure us and itself that these goals are met.  Is it a flawed strategy?  Probably, and it certainly wont make any friends in the movie industry, but funny's funny, straight up; the audience's destination to the laugh rarely matters.That said, this is hardly an excuse for everything.  Indeed, Roach's nutcase of a movie occasionally finds itself floundering under the unpredictability of its own comedy, often indulging in itself so much that it leaves its audience clueless and in the dark.  You'll know these moments when they arise, and it will be a struggle to find the proper emotional response.More often than not, however, the movie hits its mark, relying on viciously quick cuts and the understanding of its lovely cast to set the tone and keep it there.  When all cylinders are blasting in synchronization, the movie's a senseless riot that will crack ribs.It really owes its success to a series of performances that are committed to the cause; given what this movie may or may not represent in the genre - that is, a degradation - that's giving a lot.  Carell's performance here is the stuff of legend, reveling in so many absurdities and peculiar idiosyncrasies - and pulling each one off, no less - that there's simply no stopping the uproars when he's on the screen.  Rudd is quick to join the esoteric group of actors who excel at playing themselves in every performance, and Galifianakis, for what may be the first and last time in his career, finds himself in the presence of even more ridiculous personas.For what it's worth, it all comes together more cohesively than you'd think.  The premise is, ultimately, a gimmick, a one - trick pony, but it's one that goes a long way towards giving you your money's worth in breathless laughs.",Dinner for Schmucks
840541,"Buck Rodgers of the 25th century.5 double-sided disc's .....1799 minutes of late 70's early 80's nostalgia and cheesy, campy fun. The entire series except for the last 10 episodes say "" Don't take me seriously, just watch and enjoy""Includes 24 episodes of season 1 ( the best of the set ) and 11 episodes of a re-tooled but actor strike-shortened season 2 .The entire series premise is built on the back of Buck Rodgers (Gil Gerard ) who is a 20th century american astronaut who somehow gets lost and frozen in deep space only to reawaken 500 years later. He finds a 25th century earth as a post-apocolyptic desert wasteland, but high-tech at the same time.This is explained in ""The Awakening "" , the original theatrical version of the pilot, that was not released on television.This original version had opening credits that I swear, I thought I was going to watch a ""Hardcore Porn"" flick. It was just unreal and hilarious at the same time ...no wonder this version did not make it to the TV set.The props and sets looked like the Director Larson moved them right from the cancelled "" Battlestar Galactica "" set on ABC to the Buck Rodgers set on NBC. If he did then they surely fit right in with the same storylines and overall feel of Galactica series  except they took the show more serious on on ""Galactica"" then on "" Buck Rodgers "".The show gets nowhere if it was not for Gerald who played a believable character and at the same time looks like he is enjoying himself with all the campiness.Of course the show would be nothing without the beautiful Erin Grey who plays Colonel Wilma Deering. What spandex uniform will she wear next ? is what every red blooded male was looking for , every week.....and she never dissappointed !!!!Pamela Hensley played the evil but enticing Princess Ardala ....her goal was to seduce Buck Rodgers and also win earth all at the same time...all in rather revealing clothing. The series could have done much better if they had her in more than just 4 episodes.This series is a delight of tight fitting spandex uniforms set in a future disco world of campy cheesiness that can't be described only enjoyed.

1437341,"Come on WB, where is the season set?!!At least give us volume's that have more than 4 episodes. The other downside to these releases and why WB is quickly falling behind in television releases, is that they don't include any worthwhile extras and don't release the show in HD. The recent Scooby movies haven't had extras either, disappointing for such a long running character, but I can justify buying them to see them in crystal clear high definition. This series deserves the same treatment. As is, with only four episodes a release and in standard definition, I'm better watching these episodes online at my leisure and these releases seem to only be aimed at parents, or perhaps complete purists who don't mind being ripped off.At any rate for anyone who wants to purchase this ridiculous release, not even a behind the scenes feature yet about how they designed or came to creating the new series, the four episodes included are:Battle of the HumungonautsWhen two giant monsters start to attack Crystal Cove, Mayor Jones asks Fred and the gang to help him and the sheriff capture them. Meanwhile, Shaggy has to choose between his relationship with Velma and his friendship with Scooby.Howl of the Fright HoundA monster called the Fright Hound starts attacking Crystal Cove and people believe Scooby-Doo is behind it. Could be Scooby the one attacking the city or is someone setting him up?The Secret SerumThere's a vampire loose in Crystal Cove, terrorizing the residents and stealing an odd assortment of loot. When the gang does some sniffing around, they discover an unlikely suspect... Daphne's MOTHER. Things are already strained within Mystery Inc., and with this latest blow, the gang is truly torn in half. Girls on one side, boys on the other.The Shrieking MadnessWith Mystery Inc. broken up, the gang decides to check out life after high school and spend a weekend at DARROW COLLEGE. But things don't go as planned when a creature called CHAR GAR GOTHAKON begins terrorizing the campus.A decent enough four episodes, this series tries to bring back the dark tone and creepiness of the original series, so despite its arguable flaws I enjoy it. It tries to do some new things while still being strongly tied and close in roots to the original series. Give it a try if you haven't seen it or had been turned off by other recent Scooby ventures. As far as these releases, WB is starting to stand for Why Bother.UPDATE: Apparently, as of October 13th 2011, WB is listening to the fans... somewhat. After these first three releases that basically rip customers off they have announced the second half of the season will be released in a 2 disc dvd set with the final 14 episodes, Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated Season 1, Part 2. Date is set for January 24th, 2012.There is no mention, however, of Blu-ray or of any special features being included. At least the dvd set, if nothing else is released, allows fans to own over three times as many episodes as these volume releases but at only $5 more suggested retail price. The set will be only $19.99 and likely sold on sale by amazon and other retailers.",Scooby-Doo: Mystery Inc. V3 (DVD)
179157,"J. Lee Thompson's 1962 film about an ex-con out for revenge is a superior thriller.  Gregory Peck plays a lawyer who's testimony about a back alley beating put sexual sadist Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) behind bars.  Mitchum serves his time and gets out of jail.  He has only one thing on his mind, making Peck pay for taking away 5 years of his life.  Polly Bergen (really beautiful), Telly Savalas, and Martin Balsam provide top notch support.  Lori Martin plays Peck's teenage daughter and the primary target of Mitchum's revenge plot.This good movie becomes a great movie because of Robert Mitchum.  Mitchum is often critized as a lazy actor who sleepwalks through many of his roles.  However, watch ""Out of the Past"", ""Night of the Hunter"", and this film, ""Cape Fear"", and I think you will have a hard time finding an equal to his talent and incredible range as an screen performer.  Whether he is playing a flawed hero, warped man of the cloth, or sexual sadist, Mitchum shows no fear. He takes chances that few actors are brave enough to attempt and he succeeds. Mitchum's Max Cady performance in ""Cape Fear"" is so good you will wonder how some of the scenes ever got by the censors of the 60's.  However, when you realize it not what you saw but what you knew Mitchum's character was THINKING that needs to be censored, you begin to understand the power of Mitchum's performance.glpearmanLaguna Hills",N/A

38277,"I had never seen Magnolia before, but I couldn't resist the Amazon sale price so I thought I'd check it out. Let me start by saying that the blu-ray is great. The picture and audio leave little to be desired. There is minimal film grain, and the colors are clear and crisp. I am not an audio aficionado, but the audio sounded fine coming out of the built in speakers on my HDTV. There are multiple supplemental features including a feature length documentary on the film. The packaging is the standard blu-ray case, the ""recycled case"" for anyone who cares about that sort of thing. Overall, the product itself has no problems. The film though, is a different story.While I enjoyed parts of the film, its not something I will probably care to watch again. From a visual standpoint, the film is well made. Additionally, the story-line is original and intriguing. Unfortunately neither of these delights can save the film from the boring and unlikable characters. The vast majority of the characters are so unlikeable, one-dimensional or neurotic, that its difficult to care what happens. I understand that this film aims for a more realistic approach towards the characters, they all have real problems and are not romanticized in the way most Hollywood movies tend to do, but  John C. Reilly and the young boy seemed to be the only characters worth caring about. While there are many films where we like the characters because they're so unlikable, here its less about the characters being unlikeable as it is them being flat or tiresome. At the end of the movie, everyone supposably has an awakening experience, but its hard to believe that any of these characters have actually learned anything and will change their lives for the better. If the movie extended for another hour, which with a running time of over three hours it thankfully does not, I think we would see that most of the characters would be just as miserable and confused as they were at the beginning of the film. Of course there are many themes in this movies concerning love and regret, but its difficult for the audience to appreciate these themes if we don't believe that the characters have actually changed. And as far as the ""raining frogs"" scene, it did not affect my view of the movie one way or the other. For anyone wondering though, the scene does not play out like a surreal event with frogs floating down from a cloudy blue sky. This is how the back of the case portrays it, but the frogs actually fall out of the darkness like huge balls of hail, splattering on the sidewalk and shattering windows. Let me reiterate though, this scene did not ""ruin"" the movie for me and actually might have been something that I would have greatly enjoyed if it had occurred in a different movie with more authentic characters.The blu-ray itself works great, but the sad fact remains that in spite of the film's interesting set-up and potential to enrapture some viewers, it was impossible for me empathize or identify with any of the characters. This might not be a problem for some films, but for a film that sets itself up as a vast web of intertwining character studies, the whole experience may leave some viewers feeling the way I did, hollow and indifferent.EDIT: 4/8 I just traded my copy in for an Amazon gift card. Ultimately I decided that although its not a completely terrible film, it wasn't really worth owning.",N/A
1412080,"To celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the off-Broadway standard ""Forever Plaid,"" this presentation was filmed and showcased as a special event in movie theaters across the country.  That's a big accomplishment for a little show!  But ""Plaid"" seems to have an enduring appeal.  It harkens back to more innocent times, and is both sweetly nostalgic and amusingly corny.  The gentle comic tone may be slightly off-putting to new audiences accustomed to flashier entertainment choices--and yet nothing seems to have dulled the glow of this irresistibly appealing production.  If you are already a fan, there is really nothing that I can say that will change your mind so buy the DVD already!  However, for newer viewers, I'll offer up a bit more.The story, slight as it is, has to do with a fifties era boy band that were killed in 1964 on the way to their break-through gig.  For an unexplained reason, the band reunites from the afterlife five decades later (usually in a small lounge type environment) to complete the performance they were never able to give.  Much of the early humor comes from the fact that they are a bit rusty, but as the show proceeds--the numbers get progressively bigger and more appealing.  The highlights, for me, have to be the hysterical sing-along calypso and the frantic (and prop laden) recreation of the Ed Sullivan Show.  But it's all rather charming and features some of the classic songs of yesteryear including Three Coins in the Fountain, Cry, Love is a Many Splendored Thing, Heart and Soul, Rags to Riches, and Chain Gang.  I'll be honest--I've seen ""Plaid"" in various productions throughout the years and this is easily the best incarnation I've encountered.  I find it all very sweet and amusing, but I don't know how much appeal it would have to younger viewers.This production reunites Stan Chandler, David Engel and Larry Raben from the original cast (with an assist from Jersey Boy Daniel Reichard) and was taped in 2009.  The film adds some opening graphics, a brief narration from David Hyde Pierce, and some visuals unique to the screen version such as overlapping effects.  In truth, these embellishments added little to the experience and a few I found outright distracting.  But it's a small point.  The show has always succeeded as an intimate stage production and that allure is captured in this showcase.  Again, there is no question that existing fans will want to enhance their collection with this DVD.  Hopefully, I've given enough information to newbies to ascertain whether this is a good fit or not.  KGHarris, 9/11.",Forever Plaid

1246609,"I don't know what prompted me to rent this in the first place, from the cover you could easily mistake it for a made for TV stinker... so I was pleasantly surprised when I ended up really enjoying it. It's a pretty straight forward teen comedy about an average kid who is trying to find a date for the senior prom. In the midst of this quest are all sorts of complications and plenty of side stories including his wacky parents who are going through a divorce and both trying to find new mates themselves.What made this movie fun and enjoyable for me is that it was easy to relate to, it was very honest, and despite the movie itself having a pretty clich&eacute; plot it managed to feel fresh and funny. I think this film successfully draws the line in having some great adult humor but not being overly raunchy (I have nothing against raunchy comedies, in fact I love them most of the time... but it's nice to see a movie be funny without going overboard).

Writer/Director Tom McLoughlin opts to take things a bit less serious than past chapters of this saga have been, adding in an element of humor to the mix and toning down on the graphic gore (although, personally, I think we could have used a little bit more of the latter). It's a formula he would use in many of the horror works he'd do after this, for both the big screen and the small one. While in less capable hands such things usually become a train wreck, McLoughlin never lets the humor stray too far into goofy slapstick and utter parody. There are a few of the in-jokes and camera mugging moments that are groan worthy, but overall the humor never totally overpowers the more horrific aspects of the film, as has happened in other attempts like this.The cast, which is mostly a &#34;who's who&#34; of television roles, does an overall solid job with the material they are given, with Thom Mathews and David Kegan the real standouts. Mathews does a great job of making you feel for Tommy's plight, while Kegan's sheriff is a great foil to Tommy. Jennifer Cooke (who fans of the 80's television series &#34;V&#34; will remember) is sexy, but never in a trampy way. In fact, there wasn't really anything in the way of nudity in this film, unlike so many others of its kind, but I never even missed it, as I was just having a lot of fun watching things unfold.In a lot of ways &#34;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI&#34; was one of the earliest films that help to bridge the gulf between horror and humor, that many others would follow for the next couple of decades. And while those efforts are certainly a mixed bag, I think they made it work well enough here to make an enjoyable little popcorn horror-comedy, provided you don't think about the actual plot too much. Die-hards of straight-laced horror and gore, as well as this saga's previous chapters, will probably not find this film to their tastes. But for horror buffs who can take their scares a little less seriously, this film is a great way to kill an hour and a half and have some fun doing it. It's a fairly enjoyable sequel to this franchise and certainly a decent horror-comedy in its own right.",N/A
680133,"This is the fourth volume in the Stone Cold series titled after his popular catchphrase at that time (and still done today a decade later) in ""What?""  Now this takes place two years after the previous volume ended with so much happening to both Austin & WWE during that time period such as WWE buying WCW making their footage available to use for the first time along with Austin being out for a year with neck surgery & recovery so this is a different look at Austin than the previous videos have shown.  Throughout this presentation, you'll hear from Austin & his peers like Arn Anderson, Ric Flair, Harvey Whippleman, his then-wife Debra, Kurt Angle, & Earl Hebner.The documentary begins with Austin talking about his match at WrestleMania X-7 against The Rock, his heel turn with Vince, and joining with Triple H before going into his thoughts on Triple H & their match the previous month at No Way Out.  Austin then goes into details about how he was trying his best to be a hated villain with examples being shown of him assaulting Jim Ross in his hometown, being extremely violent with chairs, and how he felt he was at his peek wrestling Chris Benoit in his hometown.  Austin's early years were discussed next talking about who he grew up watching, getting into WCW, what was different from his style then compared to now, and who he watched & learned while others were commenting on what WCW did wrong with Austin.  After talking about his appearance on MadTV, Austin went into details about trying to expand his character with his comedy bits such as his bad singing, interactions with Vince & Kurt Angle, and the origin of his ""What?"" catchphrase.  Austin & Angle's SummerSlam match was talked about next going into details of the story they were trying to tell to make it a classic encounter, the episode of SmackDown after the 9/11 attacks, talking about his off-camera interaction with the audience & staff at ringside, and concluding with Austin's closing thoughts on his career & the business.Again, I only saw the VHS version of this & not the DVD so I don't know what the bonus features are but I know that this was a great set to have in regards to Austin because this was the first time we got him & others talking in detail about his WCW career with the footage to show for it.",N/A
1364408,"A time will come in which the current crisis caused by the sharks of Wall Street and the banks, among others, is going to be examined in more detail by Hollywood. We need a strong testament about how greed is always a cause for so much misery - even if we don't learn from it. Perhaps the riveting and unforgettable ""The Company Men"" will suffice for now. It is a warning call for those who watch it and those who have been suffering due to our present economic mess.Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) is a young, successful high-profile executive at GTX (Global Transportation Systems). Just when everything is going well for him, he is informed that there has been a consolidation at the corporation, and that his position has become redundant. Because of this, he is fired. As you can imagine, everything down spirals for him from then on. He lives in a big house, drives a fancy car and has a beautiful wife and two children. With time, pressure begins mounting and he can not make payments anymore. He tries to look for jobs, but has no success. Eventually, Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), one of his co-workers, is also fired, as well was Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), who happened to be their boss. Curiously, Gene, together with James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson), were two of the original employees of GTX. Salinger eventually becomes the owner of the company and begins consolidating his power, guided by greed and corporate sharing. He uses Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) as his henchwoman, who is in charge of downsizing personnel. The film guides us through the lives of Walker, McClary, and Wood ward, as they desperately try to survive.""The Company Men"" is honest and eye-opening. It tells us that we are all together in the current state of things - in this particular case, the movie focuses on extremely highly-paid employees, including a millionaire. It shows the evolution of despair in great detail, and how it affects the family and the self-respect of the individuals who are victims of downsizing. It also shows the role of wives in sharing the pain. The film also stars Kevin Costner as Bobby's brother-in-law. The way the movie ends, I won't be surprised if there is a sequel - it screams for one. ""The Company Men"" is a great companion to ""Wall Street,"" and Ben Affleck's character will remind you to the one that he played in ""Jersey Girl."" The Blu-ray edition also includes an alternate ending, deleted scenes, making-of documentary, and audio commentary by writer-director John Wells.

It is by far one of the best scary movies I have seen in quite some time.The acting in this movie couldn't be more perfect. John Cusack is exceptional for this role. When I heard that the movie would basically have one setting, room 1408, I was a bit disappointed at first.. I kept thinking how could they make an entire movie with this one ""scary room?"" Boy, was I wrong. This movie has everything a horror movie fanatic would love; it's creepy, it plays on the psychological effect (is he going crazy or is it just the room), its emotional. And just when you think it has ended, and he has finally died, it continues but does not drag on. The movie was so good my palms and feet were sweating (haha).The only thing that I wish they included was what the room looked like when he finally left. Was everything that happened all in his mind, or did all those horrible things really happen? *SPOILER ALERT* his wife is called and when he tells her to call the police and come to the room she tells them that she did, and there was no body in it. Was that just apart of him going crazy or did that happen? I just can't figure out, especially when at the very end his wife hears him talking to his little girl.. which means everything really did happen to him.Either way, this was an amazing movie. I highly suggest watching this.",1408

For whatever reason the glue had soaked through the paper & made it have an unattractive brown line down the middle of  the paper. Besides the glue stained paper, it doesn't make sense to have it on the outside because it will get torn up whenever I put it on the shelf with other movies. It doesn't fit in the box, either. Beyond that you have a very attractive box.Should you buy it? It would probably be cheaper to buy the separate releases.

As Clooney says in the special features, the star of this film is the screenplay.With Clooney's ""Bob"" loosely based on Bob Bauer( to hear more of Bob Bauer, check out his commentary on RED ), this has plenty of realism from the intelligence side, and the consultants are not party political, but as they emphasize, they aim at being a-political; however, I am aware that me saying that is not going to be agree-able to some. Since the film reveals the structure of what happens, and as one producer says, those people doing things that  we might think as morally questionable do not see them as such, in fact they have very good arguments to support their side. So, as stated a few times, its not all black and white but more grey, with plenty of scope for questions.This is a brilliant watch with a superb finish.The extras show some great material, and the deleted scenes are great, and I would question why they were deleted.A note about second hand items: I bought this accidentally as second hand ( I thought I had bought a new copy); I did not worry since it was Amazon, and I thought with a rating of ""Used"" Very Good"", I thought it would be great. Well, the digital break up at the start and finish of the film is extreme for a ""Very Good"" copy, and might be passable for Good or ""Okay"", but not ""Very Good"".I will avoid second hand movies in the future.Meanwhile I will hopefully be able to buy a new copy somewhere.",N/A

The movie is a lesson on solidarity as the two children cooperate with their mother even tough they are still very young. It is also a lesson in parenting as the mother never loses her mind or charges on her children as most stressed out parents do. The unconditional love among the three of them is a constant, the stability of this story. It is a movie with a happy ending because they managed to survive anyway, against all odds.

1307127,"Machete"" is one f those films that you need to view when you are in the proper frame of mind.  And while you are in this zone, you need to consider just what the film is and what the film is meant to be.  I watched this one late at night and ran across it while channel surfing, which is the only way I watch T.V.  I have to tell you that I very much enjoyed it, as hokey as it was.Hey, you have Danny Trejo (A recent favorite of mine for action films; he is as good as Arnold and most certainly can act better) staring along with Robert De Niro, Cheech Marin (Now who on earth does not like Cheech?), Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan (They both could do a movie without saying a word and I still would enjoy it), Steven Segal (Playing Steven Segal...need I say more), Stacy Keach and a slew of other familiar faces.  This is a good cast and each named here have turned out some fine movies...well, most of them have.  If you start with a good cast not much can go wrong...right?  Well the answer to that question will all be in the eye of the viewer.  Let's take a look at what this movie is and what it is not.First, as other reviewers have so well pointed out, this is a parody of the old racial exploitation movies of the 1970s, make no mistake.  To take this movie with even the slightest grain of seriousness would be a grave error and greatly distract from the enjoyment of the entire film.  The plot is absolutely silly and the action shots will stretch the viewer's credibility to the limits.  Many of the lines in this movie can best be described as hackneyed at best.  It must be remembered though that this was done on purpose.  The maker of this film was out to make a point and in my opinion, he did his job well as did his actors.Secondly, there is scene after scene after scene after scene of extremely graphic and completely gratuitous violence.  I lost track of the body count and the maiming early on in the film.  Again, as far as I can tell, this was the intent of the films maker.  It also contains completely gratuitous nudity and partial nudity, but considering whose skin we saw, I must say I was grateful for this aspect of the film.Third, the movie does exploit and does make a political statement, crude though it may be.  We basically have illegal and legal Mexican immigrants' verses stereotyped right-wing gun nuts and racists.  Both the parts of the abused and down-trodden immigrants and the wing-nuts are overplayed to the hilt and both are so stereotyped that it is quite obvious that it was done on purpose.  If it had not been so grim and gruesome, it would have been funny.Forth, this is most certainly an action thriller and the action is plentiful, graphic and almost nonstop.  The severed heads and limbs are without number and the casual shooting and blowing up of people...well; even the most jaded viewer should be well sated after this one.On a personal note; Steven Seagal really needs to stay away from the surgical enhancement people, the botox parties, and back away from the chow table...Steven, Steven, Steven!I am giving this one four stars simply because I am taking the film for what it is and it was sort of fun to watch...once.  I am taking one star away because I would have loved to have seen a bit more of the gratuitous nudity and semi-nudity and I most certainly would have liked to have seen more of the leather warrior woman outfits.

1346304,"Our video came with a warning that it was for 12+, and I strongly agree and caution parents. While this is a Disney product, it is NOT as light hearted or cartoonish as the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The violence and Foley effects (sound effects) of squishy stabbings are a bit too gruesome.The plot centers around three brothers, sons of a King of an ancient Persian Empire, who uncover sedition on their boarders, and invade a Holy City, which enrages their father the King. One son is the first-born heir, the other a military general, and the third a loveable rogue, who was adopted by the king for an act of bravery in his adolescence.The Holy city holds a mysterious secret, and a beautiful girl who guards it, and provides a wonderful McGuffin of button-button-who's-got-the button for the rest of the romp.The acting is fine, and there are characters by the dozens. Lots of elements are heavily borrowed from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and similar action adventure stories, but the plot never drags and the hero and heroine have an amusing friction as they fall in love through their trials.Sadly, Ben Kingsley's make-up makes him look odd, but it was delightful to see him and he does his usual excellent job. Jake shares his chiseled good looks and apparently does a lot of his own stunts, it was only afterwards that I learned the film is a derivative of a video game, but many of the intricate acrobatics make sense once you learn this.The movie is quite long, but doesn't really flag. Our 12-year-old daughter and my wife both enjoyed it, although you would have guesssed the film was pitched for teenage boys.Once again, be very cautious on the violence, this is not for the eyes of those in their tender years.Final word, we are a very conservative traditional Catholic family, so we are cautious about movies with to much ""magic"" in them and distortions of the supernatural. While there is a strong element essential to the plot that involves ""the [g]ods"" within the context of the film it makes sense and while I did discuss these elements with my children, they had the good sense to recognize the difference between the film's structure of fantasy and reality. But not every parent, particularly conservative Christian parents increasingly concerned about our continually coarsening world where the demonic is accepted as normal, would come to the same conclusion.

903402,"Like many ardent Doctor Who fans, I spent much of the 1990s wondering if the BBC would ever get around to producing new episodes of its signature science fiction program. Well, I should've heeded that old cliche, ""be careful what you wish for,"" because the Beeb did start making Doctor Who again and I ended up sorta hating it.To start, I should try to explain the ... ah ... strange appeal of the classic series. Despite being filmed on the cheap and in a rush, the original Doctor Who generated a lot of witty and engaging episodes, which hold up well for those of us who can tolerate (or even enjoy) camp. To me, the show was always at its best when it was cerebral (e.g., The Aztecs, City Death, Snakedance) while the ""action"" or ""scary"" episodes were much overrated by fans (see Earthshock, or almost any of the Troughton Doctor's kiddie-oriented monster episodes).Alas, this revival series can't really be described as ""witty"" or ""cerebral""; indeed, it throws out the intelligence of the old show in favor of gloopy sentimentality and domestic drama of the soap opera variety. (Will Rose and the Doctor kiss? Or will Rose go back to her doofy ex-boyfriend? Oh, the suspense!) Now, I quite like domestic dramas, when they're well done; indeed, my favorite film director is Yasujiro Ozu, who elevated the genre to high art. But watching this season of Doctor Who, with its shrill cardboard characters (I'm thinking of Rose's mother here) and superficial conflicts, is as far from good domestic drama as Earth is from the sun. It doesn't help that every ""emotional"" moment is underlined by manipulative music, over-the-top acting, and lots of crying.On the plus side, this season had an impressive star in Christopher Eccleston, who may be the most accomplished actor to ever play the Doctor. That said, he is not the best Doctor by a long shot, because showrunner Russell T. Davies didn't use him right. Indeed, throughout this season, Eccleston veers from effective to obnoxious. His overall character - an angry man who tortures a helpless Dalek and practically taunts Rose by showing her the destruction of planet Earth - is not really that nice, or that evocative of the more charming gentleman-genius Doctor of the original series. But at times, Eccleston is a good enough actor to vault over the bad writing and make his Doctor memorable.Like the Doctor himself, the scripts here are uneven. Mark Gatiss writes an excellent episode about Charles Dickens fighting zombies, and Robert Shearman contributes a pretty good script for the Dalek episode (I'm not sure why he wants me to sympathize with the mass-murdering creature, though). Alas, showrunner Davies consistently pens the worst episodes, and uses the series as a showcase for his weird opinions on such irrelevant topics as reality TV and, of all things, weight (one of his villains is depicted as being too thin; another is too fat). Another flaw of Davies' writing is his over-reliance on silly deus ex machina resolutions; the season finale is particularly bad in this regard, as it literally ends with a god emerging from a machine and solving all the Doctor's problems for him!Finally, the production design is also hit-or-miss. British fans and TV critics tend to describe the new Who as a big-budget spectacular, but to my jaded Yankee eyes, this looks like just another cheesy BBC production. The ""redesigns"" of the TARDIS and the Daleks look little better than the originals, the opening credits resemble a screen saver, and the quality of the video footage is poor (the actors' skin tones look orange!) The CGI special effects, meanwhile, improve on the special effects of the original series (anything would) but are still mediocre; I, for one, prefer older Who special effects, which are quite funny when approached with the right attitude. As for the Slitheen, they easily rate among the stupidest-looking Doctor Who monsters in history, and they appear in no less than three episodes of this season. I'll take the Destroyer or the Zygons over them any day...In short, I was disappointed by this revival of Who, and I'm afraid that the show only got worse with time (with the exception of season four, which managed to produce a few good episodes, like ""Midnight""). As for the DVD package itself - well, these episodes weren't filmed in high definition, so they already look a bit dated and rubbish. And the special features mostly consist of the production team congratulating itself for its own cleverness. I prefer more honest, retrospective features to this kind of self-praising stuff.Anyway, while this isn't exactly *terrible* science fiction, it is overrated, and I'd give it a miss in favor of (a) modern sci-fi that's better written, or (b) older sci-fi that's funnier and more soulful. Like, erm, Doctor Who...",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series
1368242,"I well remember the night in Philly when I stepped into the theater to see this for the 1st time; there was a life-size (plaster?) model of a cow in the lobby painted in wild day-glo, psychedelic colors. Can't recall if there was a sign next to it which read ""sacred cow"", or if that was simply my own conclusion...Anyway, I actually REELED when leaving the theater, the whole experience hit me that hard; over the years if you were lucky you could catch it @ a University showing or @ one of those great ""alternative"" second run movie houses. GREAT hard-hitting rock n'roll, mellow times: a communal joint would usually work its way down down the row of seats, total strangers united in their appreciation of the world's greatest rock n'roll band.So catching it in a 1 night only showing last year was a blast...just wanna counter those nay-sayers who have reservations about ""primitive recording quality"" or think the DVD is somehow akin to a ""poor quality bootleg"".

Sure, the book and the movie are controversial, but if you take it as entertainment, rather than a serious look at history, it is a fast and fun experience.

838841,"This is an endearing and thought provoking movie about Sarah, a straitlaced teacher in Idaho who finds herself falling for Virgil, a heavily tattooed hulking tattoo artist with a heart of gold.While the movie centers around Sarah's character and her development, I think what sells it in the end is the actor who plays Virgil.  He's a big, obese guy with dozens of tattoos and sort of a person who you might find yourself feeling a bit nervous about if you encountered him on a dark street at night.  But appearances are deceiving, because he's got an artist's soul and a gentle manner that makes plausible the idea that a beautiful young woman might fall in love with him.Another good point to the film is that while several characters are out of central casting of cliches (Sarah's domineering older sister and Virgil's biker-stoner friends), Virgil's antagonist, Sarah's fiance, is not depicted as a jerk or loser.Still another plot device of note is borrowed from ""When Harry Met Sally"" in that the movie is interspersed with what we can assume are real people who talk to the camera about how and why they got tattoos.&lt;spoilers>One mistake in the plot I think was to have Virgil drop by Sarah's house after they had slept together and get greeted at the door by Sarah's half-naked fiance (after when Sarah and the fiance reconcile briefly).  I suppose that's something that can and does happen in real life but it made me like Sarah a little less and keep in mind the admonition that getting involved with someone who is going through a break up in a long term relationship is a great way to get hurt.But I give the movie points for not having Sarah run into Virgil's arms at the end.  She instead goes off on a road trip to ""find herself."" And Virgil doesn't say, ""I'll wait for you babe,"" but indicates whether they reunite will depend on what their future selves decide.But the movie implies a happy ending because Sarah is fitted into the ""real people"" framework I mention above (because she got a tattoo from Virgil before going off on her road trip).  In that brief conversation with the unseen interviewer she mentions she ""fell in love with a biker.""  So I for one am concluding she and Virgil are a couple in the fictional world created by this film.","Tattoo, a Love Story"
399575,"When you watch Anthony Hopkins play Richard Nixon you forget all about Anthony's Oscar-winning role as Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", a feat I believed he would never pull off. This really adds credence to the kind of wonderful actor Hopkins is; highly identified as the mad serial killer he became known as, Hopkins tore into the role as the complex and very controversial 37th President of the United States. An Oliver Stone film, ""Nixon"" tells the dramatic story of a young boy growing up in California who would become the only President in U.S. history to resign from office on August 9, 1974 due to his involvement in the Watergate scandal.""Nixon"" also dramatizes the President's battle with alcohol and presription drugs and his battle to end the Vietnam War.Although some critics loved the film ""Nixon"" became a box office disappointment grossing a modest 13.5 million dollars on a $44 million budget. The film received four Academy Award nominations including a nod for Hopkins as Best Actor and one for Joan Allen as Best Suppoting Actress for playing Pat Nixon.This new DVD and Blue Ray release features over 25 minutes of rare footage never before released along with a new documentary on Nixon, trailer, a ""Charlie Rose"" interview with Oliver Stone, and more.If you enjoyed this film others you may enjoy include ""JFK"" (also written and directed by Stone) which details the death of John F. Kennedy, and the movie ""W"" starring Josh Brolin as George W. Bush.",Nixon VHS
1214318,"I don't get all the negative reviews -- this movie actually has a lot going for it.  And personally, I've always liked this kind of tripartite structure, whether the three separate stories interconnect at the end (as is the case with this film), or connect only through an actor or general theme (as with my favorite, 1955's excellent ""Three Cases of Murder"").  I was entertained by ""Amusement:"" it is not just a flick to help waste your time, and the folks involved in its making clearly wanted to make a good movie, despite the budget.As mentioned, ""Amusement"" consists of three stories with somewhat open endings, all three of which are resolved in a common d&eacute;nouement at the end.  Other than the first story, which I felt was the weakest of the bunch, ""Amusement"" is mostly carried by the main actor, Katheryn Winnick.  Despite her demure clothing throughout, Winnick is decidedly more Playboy-bunny (well, a very athletic bunny -- she is after all a Taekwondo champion) than ordinary-girl-next-door, and at first I thought she was slightly mis-cast.  I was wrong -- not only does she give a truly solid performance (notably better than the norm in these sorts of roles), her inherent sexuality seemed to enhance the sense of a strong, tough woman who will survive no matter what.  Winnick is much more than eye candy here; she actually carries the film.The sets deserve a special mention -- they are above the norm.  The pacing, and focus on telling a coherent story (really hard, I would think, in a movie structured like this) are also above-average.",Amusement

790490,"""Rain"" is based on a short story by W. Sommerset Maugham. A very young and lovely Joan Crawford gives a wonderful performance as a former prostitute on the lamb. You see little of the later persona she created for herself here but she was perfectly suited to the part. She meets a powerful and opinionated preacher and his prudish wife on the island of Pago Pago in the Rainy season and by means of what most of which seems much like cruelty tries to convert her to his own religious beliefs and the consequences of that belief to her personal life. Other travelers also add to the plot with their observances and opinions of the relationship between ""Sadie"" (the prostitute) and the Preacher. I won't tell the story and ruin it for you but there's a lot more going on in this drama. The ending is profound indeed but the real story is found in the dialog and the actions, thoughts and feelings of the characters. A true piece of classic storytelling. The role of ""Sadie"" was also played prior to this version by the beautiful Gloria Swanson in ""Sadie Thompson"" but the Joan Crawford version really holds up even now. A remake of this would be wonderful if someone would do it. I love this book and for Joan Crawford fans this movie is a must. Well worth the price. You'll want to watch it over and over and you'll notice something new each time. I recorded the audio book version of  ""Rain""(Version 2) by W. Sommerset Maugham on librivox and it's free to download and listen to so if you want a preview of the movie which stays marvelously close to the book please check it out.

385719,"In the 1950's, British working class kids were looking around for something new and original.  Was it ever thus?  The Blue Collar classes had the Music Halls and Variety, and were satisfied with that.  Probably because they were happy to have survived WW2, and already had had enough excitement to last a lifetime.  The younger generation though, not having much if any recollection of the war wanted to find something fresh and novel to bring meaning to their boring, hum-drum lives.  All the best stuff seemed to be coming from across the Atlantic.  The movies, the Jazz, the Blues, and the Swing Orchestra's - and also this new stuff called Rock and Roll.  And what about that alarming young man who sings and moves in such a provocative manner called,ermmm - Elvis something or other?  All over Britain the kids enthused over this stuff.  They tried to copy and recreate these performers and their music, for a domestic audience because the demand was insatiable.  Unbelievably, there were no proper venues anywhere in Britain to entertain a mass audience like a rock concert for example.  Elvis never came to Britain to perform through his whole career for this reason - according to the Colonel...  There was also a great deal of prejudice from the older generation who just did not like this crazy music scene at all; and boys with long, untrimmed hair were an absolute disgrace!  Britain produced its own Rock & Roll stars like Lonnie Donegan, Billy Fury, Marty Wilde, Frankie Vaughn, Tommy Steele, Cliff Richard to name a few who were really nothing more than Brits trying to be American on stage.  However authentically American they tried to be, they just sounded sort of - British!  Few of these artists made any impression in America that I can remember.  When the Beatles burst onto the scene in that extraordinary year of 1963 they were a marvel.  I was only about 15 and got completely carried away with the whole Beatle-mania circus.  I ache with nostalgia for those heady times when I look back now that I am well into my 60's and approaching retirement.When the Beatles made their first tour of America in February 1964 the feeling here was they probably wouldn't catch on in an America still mourning the tragic loss of JFK just a few months earlier.  Would they really like and appreciate a bunch of `Limey' kids bringing their music back home to them?  I thought that Americans would probably ignore them at worse or tolerated their presence at best.  It is difficult to explain to younger people today how poor international communications were in those far off days.  News took a day or two to circulate as satellite telecoms were in their infancy and needed a special effort to set up.  It took me nearly a week to find out how the Beatles had gone down in New York.  I can remember listening to a broadcast from New York on short wave radio about the Beatles driving down Broadway in separate limousines.  If it hadn't been for a BBC radio show called ""Saturday Club"", hosted by the great Brian Matthew, I really don't thing I would have heard anything at all. We Beatles fans feared that they had completely bombed and had become a national embarrassment.  Gradually, the news hit that far from being a dismal failure - they had created a sensation!  I noticed that many, many people I met over here at the time were simply gobsmacked and open-mouthed with wonder about the Beatles' amazing reception.This glorious film, ""A Hard Day's Night"", gives a modern viewer a taste of British Beatle mania.  To me it is a treasure trove of nostalgia from a rather worn out and rather shabby England that was gradually coming out of its post-war gloom.  An England that was beginning to stir and to re-awaken, and we the younger generation had to prove to ourselves that we really did have something to offer the world.  An ancient, anachronistic country, weighed down by its long history.  Exhausted by war and its aftermath, deeply in debt; no longer a first-rate power.  Great Britain was finished - and the future was to be American!  What was to happen next has become - well, a sort of a legend.  ""A Hard Day's Night ""captures a brief moment of time that became a fulcrum in my own life's experience, when things were never to be quite the same again.  It is a documentary as much as it is a film.  But whatever - it is smashing entertainment; but 'tis a pity that such an important film has been given such a poor rendition for a presentation on Blu-ray. Hence the measly four stars. Surely it deserves better...",N/A
1156781,"Funny Ha HaFor all the time I have had this movie, I still have not watched Critical Condition! I guess it's an ok movie, though I bought the disc for Brain Donors anyway. This double feature was cheaper at the time than the DVD of just Brain Donors, so I ordered this instead.Brain Donors stars in the lead roles John Turturro, Mel Smith, and Bob Nelson. Turturro is probably best known today for his roles in the three Transformers movies.There is literally an ambulance chasing lawyer named Flakfizer (John Turturro) and is called upon by his client Lillian Ogelthorpe to help settle affairs with her estate after he husband dies.  To arrive at Lillian's house after being summoned he meets and shares a cab with Lillian's employee Jacques (Bob Nelson).  The cab driver Rocco (Mel Smith), whom later becomes an employee of Flakfizer's along with Jacques arrive at the Oglethorpe estate and the craziness ensues.  Much to the dismay of another attorney also employed by Lillian Ogelthorpe, Edmund Lazlo (John Savident) Lillian hires Flakfizer to run a Ballet Company along with Lazlo.Lazlo is a serious, business minded lawyer as compared to Flakfizer that cannot do anything without either acting outrageous or concocting some type of scheme.  Flakfizer is unsuccessful in his attempts to attract the ballet dancer ""The Great Volare"" (George De La Pena) to the new ballet company, instead pursuing a lesser known dancer.  Lazlo however is successful at hiring Volare and the reactions and schemes and silliness goes to another hilarious level.  The movie is more and more outrageously funny as it goes along, never making any attempts at any kind of a meaningful plot.I really loved how the movie was a journey, a discovery, an experience of the situations all of the characters found themselves in....and it was fun to watch.  One other great thing I loved about the movie is that I forgot I was actually watching a movie and I felt I was seeing a story unfold.The ending scenes are full of slapstick, silliness and also a satisfaction that even though you had no idea how it was going to end - it works out like you knew it would.  That's my take....don't want to say too much about it...in case you have not seen it just yet.  To see Falkfizer going up against Lazlo and all the silliness that is following.....it's great!  I wish there could have been a sequel.....this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!The line ....""A likely story""..... is my favorite. You have to see the movie to appreciate it. While the movie may be about a ballet company, this movie is far from artistic.

1300547,"Pixar has changed the way we look at animated films, and truly become the standard against the way we measure these sorts of movies in the 21st Century.  The detail that goes into the plot, character development, and animation is nothing but the best.  Unfortunately, Alpha and Omega isn't from the studio that gave us Buzz, Nemo, or Dug the Dog.  That's not to say it's a bad movie.  Just that its an `also ran'.The plot is harmless enough.  Kate and Humphrey are members of the same pack, but not of the same social standing.  Kate is an Alpha - a hunter and leader, driven and trained to be the very best.  Humphrey is a good-natured and loveable goofball who pals around with his buddies, rising to the occasion whenever absolutely necessary.  Sadly, Humphrey - an Omega - has feelings for Kate, and that's not just going to fly when it comes right down to pack law.  Think Romeo and Juliet for the Wild Kingdom set.But when the pair of wolves gets tranquilized and relocated hundreds of miles from home, the journey back gives them a chance to discover each other.  Sadly, the journey just doesn't live up to its potential.  You can see each plot development coming from a mile off.  We're also subjected to numerous jokes involving bodily functions and butts.Hayden Panettiere and Justin Long do a passable job as the star crossed Kate and Humphrey.  Dennis Hopper and Danny Glover also turn in decent efforts as the senior statesmen of the Wolf community.  Vicki Lewis from Newsradio, and more recently Sonny With a Chance, is also fun as Kate's tough mom, Eve.Alpha and Omega may be a fun way to pass a rainy afternoon, but its unlikely it'll earn a cherished place in many family's video libraries.",N/A

I believe anything could be better than this 'film', even cutting myself to pieces and filming it would be more fun than this crap!Danny Glover stars in this. I had to check the main Amazon page to verify that sense I don't own this crap. Isn't that a shock in the rubber parts??!! To think at one time he was doing such GREAT work in classics like ""The Color Purple"" to sink to doing this. Wow, what a downfall!! I think Danny Glover needed the money. I was embarrassed for him! And, I thought he was embarrassing in ""Gone Fishin"", but this is the bottom of the barrel. This is unwatchable garbage.Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value.This isn't 'horror', nor is it a 'film', but disgusting pieces of footage combined together to whet a poor filmmaker's egotistical fetishes and air them in public for all to see; and, what vile carnal garbage this is, at that. Bilge like this should be flushed down the toilet, along with the people who made it. I couldn't sit through more than 20 minutes of this crap. It isn't merely disgusting, it's PRETENTIOUS JUNK that's pretending to be ""art"", when in reality it has NOTHING to say or add to the world...except maybe provide viewing pleasure for people who get off on watching torture. And THAT'S scary. We've sunk pretty low. These are some sorry individuals who made this!The scariest thing is indeed the fact that so many people love this crap. Some are starting to call it ""torture porn"", meaning that it's pornography for people who love violence, not sex. I think that's an apt description.These movies are inhuman. People, mostly kids and young adults, are paying good money to enjoy watching inhuman acts. Society is becoming like ""Lord of the Flies"". And the people who are the sickest are the least likely to see it in themselves, apparently.I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema.I read someone reviewing ""Hostel part 2"" saying that Hitchcock would love it. HUH??? REALLY???! What drugs are these people on to even remotely try to compare this garbage to anything Hitchcock???! He wouldn't even watch such crap, let alone applaud it. And the same goes for Jonathan Demme (the director of the classic ""Silence of the Lambs"", another film these 'fans' are comparing this crap to).Don't get me wrong, for I believe everybody has the right to form their own opinion, but these type of films were hidden from sight and considered illegal just 20 years ago, and now they are being paraded from theater to theater with pride. What the h*ll happened to our society???If I wanna see someone digging in a toilet, I will watch a plumber working, that would be more entertaining than this trash any day.And, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there.

1405012,"Contrary to most previous reviews, this is an acceptable to good movie. I base this statement in that: the story is based on historical events rarely addressed in cinema before, that is, the conquest of Northern Italy by German emperor Frederick Barbarossa during his quest to redeem former Carolingian Empire. Second, digital recreation of Milan, a few parts of Rome and other Italian cities is good. Third, battle scenes are gory and far from mediocre. I do agree with some reviewers in that acting by the Italian hero could have been better, and some awful ""freedom"" screaming could have been reduced. So, if you are looking for a fine action movie on a rarely addressed historical episode during European Middle Ages, give this a try.As far as I could appreciate, the audio sound was fine. The digital transfer seemed pretty good to me (I watched the movie in a 46' Sony led TV). English and Spanish subtitles are provided, so are a few extras (Behind the scenes featurette, trailers).

The technical crew gathered together here was fantastic: Rob Bottin (special effects), Albert Whitlock (matte), Ennio Morricone (musical score) and, of course, the crew of actors headed by Kurt Russell. The film carries a dark mood that doesn't go away even when the movie ends. Perfect.Carpenter would later adhere to more pulp subjects: Big Trouble In Little China, In The Mouth Of Madness, Prince Of Darkness; like he'd already done with Escape From New York (1981), which is before The Thing (1982) but the latter is not just fun, is a masterpiece. Like Halloween, The Thing and  is a serious horror construct that creates pure tension in the viewer.Though I still like his other cheap entertainments (Escape From NY and Big Trouble... being masterpieces of such style), I can't compare they with his more stern works.

1114626,"I remember liking the music that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers made when they first came along.  My rock and roll listening years coincide pretty much with their history.  And I'm from central Florida too, so it made it a little more special I guess that they were a good band.  I remember the buzz that ""damn the torpedoes"" created when it came out.  So many great songs on one album didn't seem possible.  But to be fair, I didn't try to be an expert on them.  I'm not an expert on much of anything.  But if you were young during the 60's and 70's, and you liked listening to fm radio, then you can better judge my qualifications.  But I do remember an early thought, that Tom Petty sounded like one of Bob Dylan's incarnations.The biographical movie (the product being reviewed) is good.  It's made in modern times, so you get some good quality sound and video for your home system.  I enjoy this modern way to enjoy rock and roll, and own several other dvd format covers of rock legends.  This one on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is a good mix of talk and music.  It's pretty much all positive perspective, so I'd guess it was conceived and financed by themselves (Tom Petty).  That doesn't bother me, because it delivers good entertainment value, and I already liked the music.  I wasn't looking for someone to knock them down anyway.I'm sort of old now, but I was paying attention when the Beatles were still new and Ed Sullivan was important, ""The times, they are a changin"" was being covered in all the grade school talent shows, and everyone knew who Roy Orbison was.  So when the Traveling Wilburys popped up, and the album was great....that was a great joy for me.  Tom Petty seems to understand how special that opportunity was for him, which I'm happy to know.The ""other"" disc is a concert in Gainesville, Florida.  It features the modern band line up (which is fine).  As a historical document, it's unfortunate that Petty doesn't look well and seems medicated (to me).  Everyone will have their favorite songs, so I won't try to add something meaningful here.  But I will say, I enjoyed watching another concert video from much earlier in their career that was killer.  Search for Santa Monica New Years concert 1978.  The band is really good live.I got one of those email reminders to go to amazon and review this purchase.  So I'm here, but I can't really offer anything more profound that what others have said.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have released some great songs and albums.  There are unrecognized gems that never get heard.  One of my favorites is their cover of Dylan's ""License to Kill"" for his 30 year all star concert.  You can watch it on a youtube search.  It really grabs me in a way I can't explain....",Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - Runnin' Down A Dream (4-Disc Set)

Unfortunately, it's as exciting as watching drapes fade.The creature is horribly done and amateurish.  Richard Hatch is awful and Koenig is worse!

1207840,"""Vacancy 2: The First Cut"" attempts a prequel of the original film, ""Vacancy"".  The result is a decent film that pretty much accomplishes what it sets out to do, albeit, without the acting of the original.  Basically, the Meadowlake Motel was originally used to videotape its guests having sex with one another.  One night, the owners of the motel discover something they believe to be far more profitable.  Eventually, three people come to the motel for a night, but they get a little bit more than they wanted out of their visit, and the movie turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse from there.Nothing special about ""Vacancy 2"".  It has a decent plot, but the acting is clearly inferior to that of the original.  On the other hand, there is more overt violence in this film than the original.  ""Vacancy 2"" is better than most of the trash we see today, but it's nothing special.  Basically, this is a ""C-"" film which may be worth watching if its on or if you are a big fan of the original.  The objective of this film is to inform the viewer how this business of videotaping violence started, and it does do this to a certain extent, but it fails with the characters in general.  There is no explanation about how the managers of this particular hotel relate to the managers in the original film.  I guess the creators of this movie felt that wasn't important, but I like to have a little more continuity from my sequels.  Today's Hollywood seems to think otherwise.",Vacancy 2: The First Cut

She plays a pampered rich girl and she does it so well it makes me laugh. When she is taken home to Kurt Russel's messy house and unruly kids; it makes me laugh as she tries to control the chaos.Of course, the basic theme of the movie is that money can't buy you happiness and that true happiness is with your family. And there are some minor themes of service and family running through this as well.This is an adorable, enchanting movie that is often overlooked. However it is one of my favorites.Enjoy.",N/A
761746,"The first time I saw this movie, I was spellbound.  It was premiered on Showtime about ten years ago, and the memory of the production remained in my head for years.  And I always vowed I would get a copy of the dvd whenever it was released.  Recently finding out on Amazon.com that it was released, I didn't waste any time ordering my own copy.  I am an avid movie watcher and I am in the process of collecting every movie I love.  I know this arduous task is gonna take years to do, but ""Feast Of All Saints"" is on my personalized ""Favorite Top 400 Movies"" list.  It actually ranks number 10.........after such favorites as ""Driving Miss. Daisy"", ""Mahogany,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""the Notbeook,"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons"" (in that order). And after seeing ""Feast Of All Saints"" after so many years, I'm beginning to wonder if it shouldn't be higher on my list.Ann Rice did a superb job of telling this unforgettable story.  I have not read the book, but I was totally familiar with her partiality to the Creole lifestyle and language.  I have always enjoyed time-pieces in movies and ""Feast Of All Saints"" ranks right up there with the very best like ""Roots"" and the multi Oscar-nominated ""The Color Purple.""  It's a shame how movies come and go right before our eyes.  As soon as a movie is premiered these days, there are soon locked away on a shelf, especially if it wasn't a hit.  Or even if it were a hit, sometimes the movie is over-exposed and still get lost in the past.  I wish there was a mini-series channel on cable where all the great mini-series could be viewed, just by checking your local listings.  And although I now own the dvd, I would still watch ""Feast Of All Saints"" on the Mini-Series Channel just for the commarderie.The cast of the movie was excellent.  I found it a joy to have the amazing and late Eartha Kitt apart of this ensemble.  I'm pretty sure this was probably one of her last major performances before her death. And I'm sorrowed that we've lost her when she was still a major force and one of the last pioneers of black cinema and Hollywood as a whole.  The film also includes the performing expertise of Oscar-nominee, Rudy Dee, and her late husband, Ossie Davis.  Their paths did not cross in the film.  But just to see them together again for the umpteenth time in a film was a joy also.  It's a shame that Miss. Dee's role was pretty quick and concise. An immediate smile comes to my face whenever she comes on screen.Another one of my favorites was the star himself: Richard Ri'chard. He did an excellent job portraying the innocent, often-times unlearned main character. I could go on about this movie.  There were so many superb moments that are embedded in my heart. Another one of my favorites was Jasmine Guy from the ""A Different World"" comedy series. It was nice seeing her in another genre different from which she made popular.  I've always enjoyed a good drama piece and ""Feast Of All Saints"" does that in a superb way.  Some of the storylines are a little nerving to some who may not be used to strong subject matter.  But, nonetheless, it adds to the in-dept look of the past and the taboo subject of the other world of voodoo-ism.  If you are thinking of buying this dvd, you will not be disappointed.  It's a full 3 1/2 hours of good fun and a history lesson about another world that we may not be accustomed to. Thank you, Ann Rice!!!!!!",The Feast of All Saints

Robinson, Jane Bryan, Allen Jenkins, Ruth Donnelly, Willard Parker, John Litel & Edward BrophyDirected by Lloyd BaconMay never be remembered as one lf his best films, but for me it is - full of weird, comic characters, and the extremely well written textbook brings out the very best of one of the greatest screen actors ever - Edward G. Robinson. The film gives you everything you expect from a sophisticated comedy of the Thirties,A gangster who owns a brewery decides to ""go straight"" and become ""respectable"", along with his unwilling gang and all sorts of funny events surface. His daughter (Jane Bryan) wants to marry a state trooper (Willard Parker) plus bodies show up in his house, and the laughter begins and erupts into hysteria.Edward G. Robinson is excellent in this hilarious, sometimes surreal gangster spoof from Warners, directed by Lloyd Bacon. Robinson is an ex-bootlegger who goes legit after the repeal of the Prohibition. One of the joys of ""Slight Case of Murder"" is that it is so harmless and never takes itself too seriously. You get the impression that everyone in it seems to be having a great time.Watch ""A Slight Case of Murder"" to see a great dramatic actor Edward G. in his prime doing comedy of all things----and very successfully!

1313105,"The Town was one of the best films of 2010 and given the large number of solid films, especially in the second half of the year when The Town came out, that is saying something.  What I did like is that Ben Affleck the director lets each of these actors play to their strengths so that we are seeing to a large degree Jeremy Renner's performance in Hurt Locker again and we're seeing Jon Hamm channel Don Draper into his role.  I think this is also a great way for Pete Postlethwaite to go out.  His quite menace is amazing.I can only offer two things that keep this from being 5 stars.  The first is that Ben Affleck as an actor just can not hold his weight with this crowd. He comes across as wooden and stiff and it's obvious that the great performances of others is pulling him along. He needs to stick to directing.  Also, speaking as a native of Boston, I have to say the North End and Fenway Park robberies border on the almost comic. I don't hold it against the film it's one of those things you have to let go to enjoy the film but I did laugh at how they were driving in the North End.

So I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this recent phase of his work. It is well produced, clean and straightforward, beautifully photographed. The casting is perfect - especially the fiery Penelope Cruz. And best of all, Woody Allen has finally become a professional auteur who makes structured, superbly crafted films about other people and their life issues, not his own. Perhaps his own rocky path has beaten the narcissism out of him. At age 75, he has matured as an artist. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a delight.",Vicky Cristina Barcelona
1404990,"Featuring a freaky fictional creature with the head of a shark, and the legs of an octopus, Sharktopus (2010) is a film that just can't be taken seriously.  And appropriately, the movie does have a lighthearted and comedic tone that is moderately entertaining, with a crazy monster and some messy kills.This Sy Fy original movie, this is your standard escaped creature tale.  Blue Water Corporation has been paid by the US Navy, to genetically engineer a creature known as S-11 designed to be used as a weapon.  Dr. Nathan Sand (Eric Roberts) and his daughter Nicole (Sara Malakul Lane) created S-11, and were able to track and control it, until it escaped in a training accident.  Now the beast is loose in the waters around Puerto Vallarta, feeding on the occasional beachgoer.The Sands hire ex-Blue Water employee Andy Flynn (Kerem Bursin), to help them recover the creature, and he heads out to sea in a small boat, while Nicole attempts to track its location on her laptop.  The monster then goes on a spectacular killing spree, showing up everywhere to grab a bite to eat.  The beast even leaves the ocean to make an appearance at show for the touristas, chomping up a couple of dancers before returning to the sea.  Flynn and Nicole eventually hook up with TV reporter Stacy Everheart (Liv Boughn), and Bones (Hector Jimenez) her cameraman, as they make a last desperate bid to destroy S-11 at a water park.Directed by Declan O'Brien (Wrong Turn 3), Sharktopus features some cool topical locations, and colorful scenery, it's fun predictable trash where you can see the kills coming, and almost all the characters do become monster snacks.  The acting is often pretentiously bad, but then it's supposed to be, and even features a cameo by producer Roger Corman as a beachcomber.  Blake Lindsey is pretty amusing as fisherman Pez Kingsbury.The special effects are slightly better than what you see in your typical Sy Fy feature, and actually shine at some moments.  The Sharktopus is pretty weird looking, and is most impressive out of the water perched on its legs.  The monster seems to vary in size, and by the end has become quite massive and highly aggressive.  Since it often appears on the Sy Fy Channel, you might want to catch it there before you buy.  It's not great by any means, but better than average for a Sy Fy production.",N/A

Pacino is a great sport for agreeing to do this movie. I guess he feels like he should since everyone else seems to be doing comedies - Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman have certainly done well for themselves with comedies lately.Sandler's latest flick isn't as bad as some of the terrible stuff he's released in the past several years, but only because his work has been abominable in the last decade.

Saying that, all of the performance's from all involved are very strong and the direction is superb as well. The Amazon synopsis explains the story very well, as do other reviews here, but suffice to say this is a richly woven story with an interesting analysis of human nature. Most WW2 or holocaust films can be particularly harrowing and although this is also the case with this film (but only in places) the emphasis is most definitely on the human relationships involved rather than graphic details of cruelty. The relationship between the young Michael and Hanna is intriguing to watch, with an unusual dynamic that is explained as the film develops and you begin to understand why she enjoys being read to so much. The relationship between them when Michael is an adult is more complex and conducted from afar and both these aspects of their relationship are portrayed extremely well. This is quite slow going in places but is worth persevering with and this makes for a couple of hours good viewing and engrossing drama.

1460619,"I like both Salman Khan & Kareena Kapoor a lot, that's the major reason ""Bodyguard"" was mostly enjoyable (which I saw on DVD).He plays the character 'Lovely Singh' - a dedicated Bodyguard, with great strength & fighting skills, who owes his life to a rich/respected man named 'Sartaj Rana'.  She plays the character 'Divya Rana' - the Daughter of 'Sartaj', she attends college and doesn't want a bodyguard but unknown to her she is a target.The information I've seen indicates this movie did well in India (mostly based on the Star power of these 2 main actors and good songs - the background theme music is very good).The first 2/3 of the movie is silly humor, but the 3 songs/dances in that first part are good (contemporary in look/sound) and seem primarily for Salman Khan (the first song includes a 1:25 short cameo by Katrina Kaif).  The several fight scenes are well done even though over-the-top as usual (almost as impressive as 'Dabangg').  The large side-kick guy character didn't click with me, just seemed a little obnoxious.In the last 3rd of the movie, the story/characters get better.  The remaining music video ""Teri Meri"" was really good/powerful, and has a better balance of Kareena Kapoor and Salman Khan (still can't get this song out of my head, Shreya Ghoshal has a really beautiful/pure voice - her singing is also great in movies like ""Vivah"").  The final fight scene is long, skillfully edited with good visual/audio effects, and brutal (but unique enough & well done).The movie's ending (last 10 minutes) can seem a little odd or hard to believe, with the time sequence jumping around, but it worked for me.Over-all the cinematography has good sharpness, lighting, color, & scenes (although no special/exotic locations).  The editing is usually good, especially in the fight scenes.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio is very good, with lots of action in the back speakers.But the DVD quality has slight noticeable compression, because even though 'Reliance Entertainment' did use anamorphic format they unfortunately squeezed it onto a single layer DVD disc(only using 4.2 GB file space, being a shorter than typical Bollywood movie at just over 2 hours long, they crammed in Special Features:""The Making Of 'BODYGUARD' movie"", ""The Making Of 'I Love You' dance"", & ""The Making Of 'Desi Beats' dance"").The END CREDITS have some 'out-take' clips shown on the left side of the screen (and some samples of the 'Teri Meri' REMIX fast tempo song version), and the ""Making Of"" also has a few funny 'out-takes'.The first movie I saw Salman Khan in was ""Marigold (2007)"" with Ali Larter, which is a good Hollywood/Bollywood hybrid movie (98% English dialogue, good music/dances & nice story, it got me hooked on Bollywood).  I first saw Kareena Kapoor in the movie ""Khushi (2003)"", which I liked a lot (very good contemporary music/dances & 'college-time' love story).",Bodyguard

Sandra Bullock has played this type of part (the workaholic, all-consuming business professional) dozens of times before, and Ryan Reynolds has ten stages of annoying (in this role he is at stage six; no, make that seven); yet the premise is cute enough:  Bullock's character is in danger of being deported back to Canada, so to avoid this little dilemma she strong-arms her apprehensive assistant (Reynolds) into a faux engagement.  And to further dig themselves into a hole before a suspicious federal agent (Denis O'Hare), the would-be couple announces they will be heading for the weekend to introduce the would-be bride to the would-be groom's real life family--in Alaska (more on that later).  Once the story shifts there, the deception is further layered, before it unravels--yet (who would've thunk!) both protagonists suddenly realize they are hopelessly in luv.It's cute (like I said), and there are some giggle moments, and the venerable Betty White is constantly rushed in to say the choice one-liners (playing Reynolds' grandma), yet there's nothing here to offer a new twist or unique plot shift to keep THE PROPOSAL from rushing headlong towards its predictable ending.  Speaking of annoying, what in the world is Oscar Nunez doing in this picture?  (Besides annoying us?)  Further speaking of annoying, as I spend half my time in the great state of Alaska, trying to pass off a Massachusetts seaside community as Sitka, AK, is the greatest howler of them all.

After an attack which leaves his friends dead, he awakens in a crude coffin with a butane lighter and a cell phone which is not fully charged. So begins this movie that is essentially telling the story of Conroy being held hostage for a hefty ransom while waging a battle against time to be rescued and dealing with increasingly irrational captors.Given that Reynolds is the only actor that the audience sees during the film and that his stage is his cramped coffin/wood box, he manages to do a great job as the anxiety filled captive struggling to be rescued.

Reynolds did such a great job adapting to his film environment that I had a problem not feeling confined.The script was clever and not completely predictable. At one point while Reynolds is in a frenzy to be located (remember he has no idea of exactly where he is because he didn't come to until he was already buried) the company he contracted with goes through a protracted process of firing him over his ebbing phone signal so they won't bear any responsibility regarding his kidnapping. While I had a problem with a couple aspects imbedded in the script, this was a taut thriller that managed to be suspenseful and terrifying.",Buried
1432644,"This movie puts a new spin on the possibility of changing realities. It is a wild mix of the movies: D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu and Ground Hog Day. And yes there is the element of a terrorist bomb and yes there is an iterative segment of time involved, in this case it is only 8 minutes.The storyline centers around Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal)- an American Army helicopter pilot whose last memory is flying in Afghanistan. He then wakes up on a commuter train, but he looks like someone else.The movie starts off like an adventure computer game, where you are thrown into a scenario where you are not sure where you are and what is really happening. As the movie progresses, you begin to realize that Colter is also in the same position, being totally unaware of his full situation.The movie is very interesting and like the case with Ground Hog Day, in each iteration of the eight minutes, Colter gets more and more done. The story is quite gripping and unfolds on two levels:- [1] the Train bomb situation- [2] the real situation of Colter StevensThe latter is quite moving emotionally and draws you into a deep longing that Colter has to make peace with his father and to hear his voice just one last time.So, although it may not be quite original in its design, there is a lot of emotional content to absorb the viewer in. In my opinion, it is a good movie and well portrayed. The end had a nice twist to it. Enjoy.",Source Code

Unfortunately that doesn't happen here.I cut the East Side Kid movies a lot of slack where production values and plot coherence are concerned because I usually find them very entertaining anyway. For me, the best part of these movies is the humorous interaction between the characters and sometimes the goofy, even improbable storylines. This movie though, is not funny, and it's only marginally entertaining at best. Most of the humor either feels forced or plain just doesn't work.So what's good about this one? I do like that when the boys realized the error of their ways they didn't just apologize but took action to make up for their mistake. In that sense this movie shows some of the heart for which the series is known. Robert Armstrong is good in his tiny role and Florence Rice has a great smile.

This was a very small budget movie shot for vhs release back in the 80's. It used cheap film and was in full screen format. The format is preserved here and the film has been cleaned up. THis looks outstanding, and this how ALL IMAGE BLU RAYS should be done. Remastered and cleaned up, with no print damage. There are a few extras on this one too that add to the experience. No obviously non  horror fans would trash this movie with it's quick cutaways and minimum budget. But we lovers of low budget horror and this is not a b movie , it's lower budgeted than that: dig this kind of cheaply made horror flick. The effects are everything from stopmotion figures , (they take pictures of a model frame by frame) to very effective puppet work ala many movies of that era. WHich often still looks better than some of todays cgi. See fright night for that. The first one is much better because of it's manual effects and far better story actually too.  The acting is decent for firsttimers and the lead actor did a good job actually. Basketcase is good very low budget horror film, it suceeded in being a twisted movie when other higher budget movies like xtro did only a so so job.

619901,"Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" was a big hit in 2003-2004. It's about an aging actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who's in Tokyo doing commercials for a week. His homelife is mundane and he's experiencing a bit of the mid-life crisis. He runs into an attractive 20-something woman, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who's in Tokyo with her photog husband, but he's gone most of the time and takes her for granted.This is a mature, one-of-a-kind film and you have to be in the right mode and maturity level to appreciate it. I said ""maturity level"" and not ""age"" because some people are pretty mature at 16 while others are completely immature at 50. I didn't view the film until last night and it worked for me. The story, music and visuals pulled me into these character's temporary world for the 104-minute runtime.The film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight. I'll only focus on the deep love element. It's been noted that the story orginated from writer/director Sofia's experiences with an aging actor, possibly Harrison Ford. Sofia is obviously Charlotte, while Charlotte's husband is Sofia's ex and Anna Faris plays the role of the other woman, which would be Cameron Diaz in real life. So there's a lot of reality in this picture.But it's not just a cathartic piece, Sofia has some powerful insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love. For one, love transcends age difference (Bob is about 30 years older than Charlotte). For another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another. Not that this ever justifies adultery, it's just a fact. As the story progresses you'll see how comfortable Bob and Charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes -- the windows of the soul -- in a profoundly naked sense. This can happen in the flash of a moment where the two people just KNOW or it can take place over a period of time, as is the case with Bob and Charlotte (a handful of days). They see the same things and speak the same language, and I don't mean English. But this presents a conundrum for Bob. Bob could take advantage of Charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vunerable. Will he or won't he take advantage?!!SPOILER ALERT!! Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.If Bob loves Charlotte so much (not to mention his wife) why does he have a one-night stand with the lounge singer? Bob slept with the singer to release sexual tension that had been building up between him and Charlotte. This was a moral failure, but keep in mind he was drunk (another failure, but have pity, he was going through a mid-life crisis). While all this is obvious, it goes deeper...Bob could have taken advantage of Charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end. Bob could sleep with the singer because he didn't love her (not that it justifies his actions). Simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.The ending is powerful and tear-inducing. No CGI, explosion or action stunt can compare. It's just an older man and a too-young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million. Tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered. They could never be a couple, even if they weren't married, and they know they'll likely never see each other again, but their love has been expressed and will be treasured for eternity.",Lost in Translation
1393552,"The short version of my review is this: the animation is spectacular and makes up for most of the weaknesses in the film. Now for details. Those who have stated in their reviews that this is the most visually beautiful film they have ever seen are NOT exaggerating. As my family watched this dvd in our living room (on our 1080p plasma) my husband kept saying, ""We should have gone to the theater to see this in 3D."" It truly looks amazing. I can't speak to the blu-ray since we only have seen the dvd, but I imagine it would bring even more of the incredible detail to life. No one in our family had ever read or heard of the books this film is based on, so the story was unfamiliar to us, though it is a familiar enough story. Young owls are kidnaped from their peaceful forest home and enslaved in an evil kingdom. They escape, find the mythical Guardians, and become involved in an epic battle of good vs. evil in which they much face their fears, draw on strength they didn't know they had, etc. There are so many elements of the story that are familiar (basic hero's quest stuff) that even my kids kept saying things like, ""This is just like Lord of the Rings"" or ""That's like when Obi Wan dies"" or even ""This reminds me of Harry Potter."" The dialogue was difficult for us to make out (we kept having to turn up the volume), but I'm not sure if that is a fault with the sound or something to do with the Australian accents. The overall tone of the film is rather dark and dramatic, and the interjection of a perky Owl City song in the middle was somewhat jarring. My 13 year old son said, ""That's cute to have an Owl City song while we're literally looking at an Owl City, but the song is too cheerful."" The names of the characters were hard to understand, and we couldn't even read some of them when the credits rolled. All that being said, I recommend everyone see this film in order to understand the sheer beauty of the animation. I thought I'd seen everything that cg animation could do, but I'd never seen anything as jaw-droppingly gorgeous as this film.",N/A

1357971,"Well, THAT was the most fun I've had in a movie in a long, long time! This thing is intricately plotted, perfectly photographed, and extremely well cast! Although there was little or no profanity and no sweaty bodies, we did see a lot of gunfire, car chases and blowie uppie stuff. The audience ate it up!First, let's talk about that cast:*  Bruce Willis (""Cop Out"") is a former CIA black-ops agent, now he's Retired, Extremely Dangerous...get it? He's trying to deal with boredom and inertia, and has taken to calling a particular gal in a call center about a check he keeps insisting never arrived.*  Mary-Louise Parker (""Weeds"") is that gal (see above). She reads bodice-rippers like Love's Savage Fury and dreams of having a manly man come into her life and sweep her away to excitement, passion and exotic locales. She is hilarious!*  Morgan Freeman (""Invictus"") is another retired agent, now relegated to a nursing home where he is dealing with a terminal illness. He too, is bored and lonely; this is NOT the way he expected his life to end.*  John Malkovich (""Secretariat"") is also part of this bunch. He spent a few years being injected with LSD, so his hold on reality is a bit shaky, but he LOVES guns, ammo and explosives! Talk about a loose cannon!*  Helen Mirren (""The Last Station"") isn't quite as retired as her buddies; she admits she still ""takes a side job or two."" She can wield a machine gun with the best of them and still packs a yen for an agent she had to shoot.*  Ernest Borgnine (""SpongeBob SquarePants"") should have retired years ago, but he's still working in the CIA's top-top-secret archives.*  Richard Dreyfuss (""My Life in Ruins"") is an industrialist who knows WHY a mysterious list was made of people who MUST die.*  Karl Urban (""Star Trek"") is absolutely perfect as a new-generation black-ops agent, every bit as well trained and deadly as his predecessors. I'm always impressed by him.This terrific film was beautifully directed by Robert Schwentke (""The Time Travelers's Wife"") and I could hardly wait to get my DVD from Amazon.com. When every scene is deliciously shot, with guts, glamor and LOTS of giggles, we naturally look to the director. Let's keep an eye out for this guy, okay?",Red

592256,"My kung fu favorites were always the classics, though I have always loved the cheesier ones -- the ones with the very bad dubbing, the ludicrous plots, and all the other cliches that came with the genre once it began to go downhill during the mid to late 1970s (with some obvious exceptions).  In particular, I've always loved the many many Wu Tang movies, many of which were completely insane but in a way that you grew to love.""Kung Pow - Enter the Fist"" is an obvious spoof of the worst of the genre, using - funnily enough - a rather serious and rather good movie, ""Tiger and Crane Fists aka Savage Killers"" - for inspiration and lifting entire scenes from that movie.  The director, writer, and star obviously knows the genre quite well and pokes fun at many of the things you would ordinarily find funny anyway while watching a typical, lesser grade wuxia film.If you know the genre, you might find this film quite clever.  Indeed, you will 'get' many of the jokes and genre nods.  However, I am not sure that the fact that you will 'get it' will make the film a winner for you.  It 'is' a clever film but it is hardly ever as funny as the real thing is.  Frankly, I would much rather watch one of the original films, badly dubbed, and laugh at that.  Which is, funnily enough, what I did once I got halfway through ""Kung Pow.""Again, that isn't to say that the film is bad -- it is funny in a very silly way, but it is hardly a winner.  There are some giggle moments but no laugh-out-loud moments for me.  Most of the humor comes from the concept itself, which gets old about 10 - 15 minutes in.  Yes, the originals were badly dubbed, the camera often panned funnily on the faces of the protagonists, the sound effects were ludicrous at times -- we get it.  But after about 10 minutes, it isn't really funny anymore and you find yourself wanting to see the originals and laugh at the often unintentionally funny segments of those movies.  Or watch ""Drunken Master,"" which has many of these conventions but is legitimately funny within the concept of the movie (and the English version 'is' badly dubbed).Could have been better.  As it is, a decent spoof.  If the wuxia classics ""The 36 Chambers of Shaolin"" or ""The One Armed Swordsman"" get 5 stars in my book, this one could never possibly get 5 or 4 stars.  And the originals, like any of the worst Wu Tang or fake Bruce Lee movies, would get a 3 or 2, then this one gets a 3.",Kung Pow! Enter the Fist
1398454,"From the box this looked like a rather brainless comedy, and some days, when you've worked all day and you want a laugh that is what you want, something fun, not too deep that will make you laugh.  The movie far exceeded expectations for me.The premise of the story is two rich, and totally opposite 20 somethings are left penniless when their father has a heart attack on his 55th birthday.  They are devastated, but even moreso when they realize he actually had filed for bankruptcy and the high life would soon change for them, when they move from their mansion near Rodeo Drive to their aunt's home in East LA.  One sister is going to law school and she is the one that adapts the best, the other can't quite make the transition to the new neighborhood.  One of the best lines in the film is when she judges a guy she sees on the street who is wearing a hoody and looks a little scruffy, saying ""Are you Homeless?"" and he says ""No, are you?"".  Yeah, that one was tough.  Can't judge a book.....Though this looked more like a comedy, and had comedic moments it is more a story about how family, tradition and heritage are so important and having a good life doesn't necessarily mean having all the material things that you want.  Both sisters learn important lessons in their fall from Prada to Nada and come out the better for it.I did not know any of the actors in the film, but felt that the acting was good and the story, though a bit predictable was very enjoyable.  I'm also a sucker for a good ending and I really liked this one.Overall, a feel-good movie, with a bit of heart.",N/A
1288048,"Let's be honest, zombie movies are rarely ever scary.  They're only able to provide short term laughs but never any actual substantial fear.Zombieland is pretty short on the zombie appearances for the most part, having lengthy segments near the middle of the film devoted more to the four main characters getting to know each other inside Bill Murray's mansion.  The zombie attack-fest doesn't really occur until the final 20 minutes and of course, the first 5 minutes.  The zombies are apparently speed runners too.For most of the storyline, we experience teenagers acting fairly normal, and in the case of the teenage boy, his goal apparently is to find a way to have a relationship with the one brunette girl he finds attractive.Woody Harrelson provides most of the laughs, acting like one of the teenagers himself most of the time and coming across like he's sort of drunk and unaware of his surroundings.  I've seen him act the same way in other films so it's not exactly a surprise.I did like the clever ways the two teenage girls get to the boys as a means to stay alive from the zombie outbreak involving sneaky tricks (one of them taking place in a grocery store, the other outside in the middle of the main highway).Woody Harrelson's long running twinkie gag was hysterical, and the entire carnival scene was well done.

1253020,"SORORITY ROWAh remakes, those pesky little things they just keep on popping up on us. Well this one is a few years old but still I think you know what I mean. This of course is a remake from the slasher pic ""House on Sorority Road"" and is not all bad. I went into this expecting another horrible film and came out kinda liking it. Now it is not a classic and I don't think you will find anything new here, but it is ok.From the title I bet you can guess this is college related and is about none other than a sorority. Yes indeed I know that is a shock but that is what it is about. And like any good horror flick it is about a group of females, you know what that means. You guessed right kiddies, lots of blood, death, and naked girls; I know it doesn't sound that bad. The film follows a group of sorority sisters that play a prank, said prank goes wrong and a fellow sister is dead. Of course from there the ""ladies"" and the prank victim decide that they should dump the body as not to ruin any graduation plans and life after school. The leader of this group is particularly all about image and not going to jail, that makes her kinda fun.Time goes by and it is graduation time which of course means party time, why not,  you only killed a so called ""sister"". So like any good teenish horror flick a killer pops up and knows what these girls have done. Will the killer go to the police with the information, no silly, said person would not be named killer for no reason. So the girls start to get threatening texts and videos and stuff to their phones. This of course only leads to multiple deaths in various ways.Now I have to say one thing first off, I could never take a killer seriously if they started texting me. I am not a texter and refuse to read them when some one sends me one, therefore I wouldn't even know there was a killer after me. If some one has something to tell me then they can call me. Any way as for the deaths this is a pretty good flick but everything else is your typical new age horror flick. I will say that the first part of this film is really good. The build up to the prank and the entire prank scene are really well done, and the aftermath at the scene is just as strong if not stronger. Everything after that is just your typical flare.The acting is everything you would expect from this type of film, which is good because that is what this type of film calls for. The leader of the sorority is wonderfully evil here, especially in the aftermath scene of the prank. Any way this is a good enough flick for a rental I would guess and who knows you may like it better than me. Was this a classic, no, but was it fun, yes.",Sorority Row

303984,"I hadn't seen Thelma and Louise in years. I had forgotten everything about it except the attempted rape. It's an okay film but I still don't get how it became such a big hit. I guess the star power of Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon made this film so popular. They definitely brought spark to their characters but other than that this movie is nothing special.Thelma and Louise are two hometown best friends. Thelma is married to a car salesman, Darryl and Louise has a thuggish boyfriend named Jimmy. Other than that, we know hardly anything about these women. The movie begins with a tiny glimpse of their regular lives and then they are off on the open road for the entire film.While at a truck stop bar Thelma meets a man, Harlen who tries to rape her in the parking lot. Louise shoots him and the two take off. From there Louise and Thelma spend their time in hotels, staying clear of the cops.There are many familiar faces as supporting characters such as Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt and Harvey Keitel.The only big problem I had with the film was Thelma's completely unrealistic and annoying behavior. Here she is almost raped and in the next scene she acts like nothing ever happened to her! It was so maddening to see how she behaved. And if that's not bad enough she even has an affair (after almost being raped)! Pathetic and pitiful. That is why it's so hard to take anything that happened in Thelma and Louise seriously. Thelma's actions were despicable and too unbelievable to even comprehend. A huge disservice to people who have dealt with that type of violence and abuse. Even Louise didn't seem realistic. She just shoots a man and her friend is almost raped and she seems to feel nothing. She is just as cold and heartless to Thelma as she could be. Granted Thelma didn't seem like a victim but still Louise could've shown some compassion for her friend. All you get is, ""Shut up, Thelma!"" Louise was very selfish. All she cared about was getting away, not helping Thelma.People always hyped this up as the classic chick flick but to me it makes women look dumb and silly with the things they did. Thelma acts like a two year old and Louise acts like some gunslinger who is living in a fantasy world. Neither of them reacted with any sense. You'd never be able to make this film in today's world and not be criticized for the women acting so dumb.Another thing about this movie is it looks very dated even for being made in 1990. It looks more like it was made in the early 70's. The quality of the film hasn't held up well at all.If you haven't seen this film in all these years you probably never felt the need to.

1374486,"Depressing, derivative, unoriginal, SKYLINE is somewhat of a merging of INDEPENDENCE DAY - meets - ALIEN - and meets - CLOVERFIELD.  Then it contains everything that has come before (and after) it from WAR OF THE WORLDS, ""V"" (the old and new tv series), ALIEN NATION, DISTRICT 9, MARS ATTACKS, the current BATTLE L.A. (which is almost the same film released just a few months apart), and the upcoming tv series FALLING SKIES... etc. Nothing worth watching except for the seamless special effects, but even the aliens and the alien spacecrafts of the film aren't interesting. There is somewhat of a social commentary about the negative 'Hollywood' lifestyle and it's denizens. It was so, that, nobody cares if the characters in this film live or die. This reviewer recommends just putting in INDEPENDENCE DAY, if one wants a rousing ""alien-attacks-earth /earth-fights-back""/type film!",N/A

I ordered it new, and surprisingly enough, it was brand new. I tried watching the movie, and realized that for the attempt, it was in fact better than I thought it was when i originally watched it.

1277276,"I enjoyed ""Jack Goes Boating,"" and oddly enough, so did my wife who usually has difficulty with movies like this.  Movies like this?  I mean movies that are produced with absolutely no commercial ""hooks.""  No beautiful people (with the exception of Amy Ryan, and even she is atypical), no obvious plot, relatively few cliches, and very few easy scenes.  ""Boating"" is loaded with ambiguity, untidiness, and complexity, and we are consistently challenged to figure out what is going on locally and universally throughout the film.OK, so why did we like it?  Hoffman and Ryan are brilliant together.  A good portion of the action, or non-action as the case may be, centers on the faces of these fine actors as they cope with events in their lives.  Hoffman's reactions are so slow and intense.  Is Mona Lisa smiling?  Da Vinci isn't around to tell us, and we can't ask Hoffman.  His facial expressions are marvelous, but early in the film we wonder whether Jack is emotionally or mentally slow.  As time passes we begin to understand that Jack's feelings are intense, and he is just fearful and struggling  with what he feels.  Likewise, Amy Ryan's Connie character is dealing with all kinds of life problems and she appears to be justifyably afraid of everything.  Yet as the story unfolds we come to understand these two characters are actually very courageous, ambitious, thoughtful, and sweet.  My wife and I developed great affection for them by the time the film was over.We loved the story.  Its was adapted from a stage play, and Hoffman's direction pays tribute to its past.  But Hoffman the director is obviously thrilled to be shooting in New York.  There is a brief segment in the DVD ""extras"" where the actors talk about how great it was to film in New York, how great New York is, etc. etc.  Agreed, New York is critical to the impact of ""Boating."" But the New York shot in this film is dark, intimidating, dangerious, dirty, and overwhelmingly lonely.  This has the very important impact of further isolating the main characters, and intensifying their courage and the warmth of their love.We liked the complexity of the characters.  Clyde is Jack's best friend and fellow limosine driver, and the scenes where he teaches Jack to swim in the ancient YMCA pool (wonderful scene selection and filming) are marvelous.  Lucy, Clyde's wife, helps Connie at the mortuary and assists Jack while he grocery shops.  Yet these kind and generous people are also bitterly cruel, and unfaithful to each other.  As the relationship between Clyde and Lucy falls apart, we watch the relationship of Jack and Connie catch hold and survive on its own.There are special scenes that stand out.  Connie, realizing her job is hanging by a thread, closes a phone deal while bleeding from the nose after a subway assault. The visualization scenes, when Jack and Connie are imagining what they want to happen were well done.  The first scene in the YMCA pool when Jack is learning to swim, including the underwater shots and those goggles.  The scene in the hospital bed when Jack visits Connie. And of course, the fabulous crescendo dinner party, where everyone is high, dinnerware and smoke alarms are attacked and destroyed, and three of the four characters spend some time in the bathroom fleeing the caos.Its not perfect, but the imperfections in ""Boating"" generally serve to enhance the experience and reinforce the reality.  I probably would have toned down Jack's violent and angry reaction to burning dinner.  It didn't seem to fit Jack's otherwise peaceful and goodness seeking character.  There are plenty of times when the viewer is left (for a few moments) to wonder where its all heading, and there are a few times when just looking at Hoffman's face doesn't add much value to the art.But overall, ""Boating"" an interesting study in character, and a very worthy departure from all the commercial schlock that sells all the popcorn and fills all the theatre seats.",N/A

The music is also typically outstanding.The package I bought contains two DVDs with the movie, eight deleted scenes (probably cut for time constraints), a bonus episode from the show, a digital copy of the movie, 8 music tracks from the movie, and best of all, a ""Platypult""! :-)One mild word of warning if you have little ones (say 6 and younger) that like P&F; this episode is a little darker than what you see on typical episodes on TV. Two of my kids were scared a little, and one had to be coaxed to watch till the end to see that no one got hurt and that the ""good guys"" won. Tellingly, they haven't asked to see it again as they do for other episodes we own. This isn't to say that this movie is too over the top or unsuitable for kids, but you may want to watch it first if you have youngsters who might get scared and make your own call.But the wife and I absolutely loved it.

I watched my Avatar 3D Blu Ray one night and then watched this 3D Blu Ray the next night and I have to say that, IMHO, this movie wins hands down for 3D effect.  This movie literally was packed with jaw dropping 3D from start to finish! While Avatar is just plain visually stunning overall, Step Up 3D is without a doubt the BEST 3D Blu Ray I have watched to date.

1403672,"Ok..........where to begin. This movie sucked. I'm sorry. Sometimes movies just suck. I heard Warner Bros spent Avatar money on this movie, marketing it as the big action adventure. Woah. Firstly, the Green Lantern is not even in the second tier of super heroes. He is so far down the chain among notables such as batman, spiderman and superman. I doubt most people even knew who this was. I knew who it was, but I never wanted to be green lantern for halloween. However, the trailers for it looked interesting enough and there was nothing out at the time. I saw it in theaters. I don't know what you get in the blu-ray version. It may not be worth it unless there is a free copy of spiderman 2 in there.Hal Jordan is cocky test pilot. For some reason, the lanterns choose him to be their next guardian. Apparently, the universe is full of green lanterns and they pick their members very carefully, but hall doesn't understand why they would pick him over everyone else. The usual super hero cliches begin. He gets powers. Learns them. Makes wise guy comments while doing so. Fights inner demons. Learn the ""real"" reason why he has been given these abilities. Fights a lame villain with a huge head. Fight another villain who is an escaped space monster. Fight said villain in large metropolitan area. Rescue a girl.What should be cool about this movie is that the Green Lantern can create stuff with his mind. A giant fist? Yes. Machine gun? Yes. Giant ramp resembling hot wheels? Yes....? This is where the movie really gets cheesy. In one scene, a helicopter, after launching from a helipad, quickly spins out of control endangering the people below. There is a party going on down below and no party is complete without helicopter launch pads. I dont know. Maybe I'm just a high roller. What does the Green Lantern do? He clips the wings which causes the helicopter to pummel to the ground. UH OH! Its going too fast and now its sliding on the ground? What does the Green Lantern do now? He makes a ramp out of thin air for the sliding machine to go onto. Yes....a ramp. In the effort to make this movie cool, no solution is ever practical or ground in common sense for the green lantern. Extravagance is on Hal's mind. Any number of things springs to mind here. What if I had these powers? I'm sure you thought you could either make giant arms and punch the thing away, build a wall to stop it, or blow it up with a canon (something he does use later in the movie). But none of this happens. The result is a weird mix of awkward action sequences that are not cool at all and look downright silly at BEST.Don't bother buying this seriously. Why spend 30 dollars on this????? Buy anything else instead.",Green Lantern
236421,"Even though it's an oldy and in black and white I loved this movie. Bought 3. One for me, one for a sister and one for a friend. You will not see blood or gore. That's one of it's best features. As you follow along you hear screams and yelling and know what's happening. You use your imagination to picture the horror of what's happening and sometimes your imagination can be a lot better and more frightening and vivid than an actual picture. The characters performances were great in keeping your mind on the unfolding story. And, in the end, you do get to see the little girl get her just reward. I watched it with some family members and as the mother was coming to understand what her daughter may be and on the verge of a breakdown she was constanly pouring a drink as well as some of the other cast members. After a while we just started laughing and remarking that the woman may have a drinking problem. As each scene unfolded we made comments like ""here we go, time to pour another drink.""

1073649,"Beady-eyed, twitching Norman Bates--the late great Anthony Perkins--returns to menace audiences with three surprisingly effective sequels.""Psycho II"" (1983) is probably the most ponderous film of the three (as far as pacing goes). After twenty-odd years in an institution, Bates is eligible for parole...much to the protests of Vera Miles, reprising her role as the sister who's been forever haunted by Janet Leigh's death (from the original). Bates returns to the motel--and his old home--and is almost immediately besieged by memories of ""mother"". The main question being: Is this all in his mind, or is the horrible past repeating itself? There are some nice wink-wink moments, such as Bates cutting a sandwich (you can hear a hair-raising scrape sound effect) and contemplating the blade. Does he lapse back into his old ways? Sorry, you have to watch. The Perkins-directed ""Psycho III"" actually delves into issues of religion & romance (yes, believe it or not, Bates almost has a girlfriend!)amidst the bloody mayhem. A young woman (Diana Scarwid) fleeing her deeply troubled past as a nun wanders onto the Bates motel property. Coinciding with a rowdy football party on the premises--which, of course, Bates gleefully slashes his way through--Bates inadvertently rescues the girl from a suicide attempt, and to his surprise, begins a courtship. There's a wonderfully bizarre showdown in a motel room between Bates & drifter Jeff Fahey--himself driven as looney-toons & applying blackmail--as these two caged-up crazies go at it to a brutally disturbing conclusion. My fave was a darkly-amusing moment in which the local sheriff--investigating the disappearance of a young woman Bates just off-ed--absent-mindedly crunches from an ice binge tainted with the victim's blood as Bates' face twitches in acknowledgment. But will ""mother"" once again interfere with Bates' chances for happiness? You can pretty much guess...The most fascinating offering is the final chapter, ""Psycho IV: The Beginning"", a prequel which cleverly fills in the blanks to Bates' past, courtesy of him chatting about matricide on a local nighttime radio talk show. Now released from the hospital, married, and starting over at a new home, Bates peels away the psychological layers of his deeply troubled past via flashbacks to his relationship to mother (played terrifically by Olivia Hussey as a pretty but seriously schizophrenic person)as moments of twisted manipulation, obsessions, and near-incest surface. As the talk show host connects the dots & conclude that their anonymous caller is none other than the notorious Bates, they become frantic with keeping him on the air & talking. Sure enough, Bates plans a ""birthday surprise""--returning to the long-abandoned, creepy Bates property to commit one more murder. But the twist ending will finally bring closure for the Bates character.Good transfer to DVD for all three movies (although there's no ""making of"" featurettes). For fans of ""Psycho"", this is well worth the price!",Psycho II / Psycho III / Psycho IV - The Beginning

1400953,"Zack Snyder just hasn't made the same impact on me that he apparently has on the rest of the moviegoing population. I enjoy his work, but it always seems like there's something to be desired when his films finally fade to black. With Sucker Punch, Snyder isn't really looking to change the formula his films have become notorious for, but the storyline just didn't sit right with me. We know ahead of time that this is all taking place in Baby Doll's head? That's like knowing ahead of time that Teddy Daniels is patient 67 in Shutter Island. Oh wait, we kind of did and that still turned out pretty great. Sucker Punch is fairly disappointing on one hand, but mostly just incredibly entertaining on the other.The Zack Snyder formula mentioned usually just involves heavy use of slow motion while most of his films have a particular look to them like they're all sent through the same filter before reaching the screen while also feeling like they all taking place in the same universe. Snyder became notorious for his R-Rated films, but then broke that mold with Legend of the Guardians. Sucker Punch is Snyder's first PG-13 film, so don't expect a lot of gratuitous gore, endless strings of profanity or graphic sex scenes on spaceships that last an incredibly long time since there's none of that. If you're a fan of any of Snyder's work, Sucker Punch still hits all the same buttons that films like 300 and Watchmen did; the action sequences are still insane and the slow motion technique is used in a way that adds a bit of gusto to each scene it's used in. When the girls first arrive on the train and they're in the middle of trying to retrieve a kitchen knife, a gun is fired as we see the bullet bounce off and shatter a robot's head. The shell then flies by the screen as we hear the air in the room howl through the shell before it falls to the ground. So if you're a doubter of the PG-13 rating, it doesn't really affect much here.This film is like a man's action movie fantasy. It's like Sucker Punch tries to roll everything a guy would enjoy in a film like hot women, heavy gunfire, a mother dragon who basically makes explosions come to her, and enough insanity injected into its most adrenaline racing scenes to keep you talking around the water cooler for hours. It's like trying to combine Showgirls, the Dawn of the Dead remake, Dead Snow, The Lord of the Rings, and I, Robot into one movie. During that same train sequence, I could've sworn the score suddenly paid homage to Terminator 2. Sucker Punch makes sure to tickle all of the brain cells in your head that are still attached to action films from your past.While the film's charm mostly comes from its action scenes and the films they pay tribute to, the flaws in Sucker Punch aren't exactly minimal. The main one being that the film's constant use of music with vocals makes Sucker Punch feel like the director's cut of an extended music video. There are three songs used practically in full in the first thirty to forty five minutes of the film among countless others as the film progresses. The film also takes place within two layers of the mind in addition to what's actually happening in reality, which makes the film feel like a less complicated version of Inception. The plan that Baby Doll comes up with seems a little too grandiose for its own good with such little payoff at times. Do you really have to dance to go to another reality where you're fighting robots on a train while trying to disarm a bomb before it explodes all for nothing more than a kitchen knife? It honestly just felt like a group of guys got together and threw all their favorite action movies into a pot and created a film with an amazing looking incoherent film before coming back around and adding a story to it to try and make everything have some sort of meaning.At the end of the day, Sucker Punch is basically just a glorified music video with really spectacular eye candy. The film can also be considered a fanboy's wet dream. If you're a guy, Sucker Punch is practically guaranteed to at least touch upon at least one of the things you look for and love in an action film. Whether it's giant samurai warriors wielding Gatling guns, steam powered zombie soldiers, hideous orcs and fire breathing dragons, an overbearing clan of bloodthirsty robots, or the fact that you just like to watch scantily clad, young women annihilate their enemies with nothing more than a blade and an endless supply of bullets, Zack Snyder's latest probably has you covered. Sucker Punch may not be the best written film of the year, but it's an action film that can still be considered a hell of a lot of brainless fun.",Sucker Punch

1401495,"Today, the ruling ideology could be found in the realm of the popular culture, first and foremost the movies. It is easy to dismiss this movie as an innocent light entertainment, but I think it is not that simple. What we are consuming is ideology of a specific kind, an ideology of caricaturing the other cultures, while asserting a dominance of the Western norms. I think ""Ghost Protocol"" incites fear, loathing, and ridicule vis-a-vis the ""Orient"" in a jokey kind of manner.""Orient"" is not a geographical term, but a cultural one. It is a gap that separated ""the West"" form ""the Rest"". The hallmarks are: a reflexive cultural contempt and even mild racism, expressed in patronizing superiority vis-&agrave;-vis other cultures. It has become, with few exceptions, a common thing in the Hollywood today.  For me, as a Russian-American, it looks like Russia has been placed firmly by the Hollywood in the realm of cultural ""Orient"". In this particular film, Russia was portrayed as a backward, dangerous, Byzantine country once more. Starting with the music -- they chose a grim, ominous music for the beginning of the ""Moscow"" scene.A group of likable American spies sent to take down a world-threatening baddie, sort of a ""Consigliery"" to the Russian government. The plot in brief: the crazed Russian wants to incite nuclear war so that the planet may be cleansed and born anew, and he's doing the ""pit two nuclear powers against each other"" gimmick to make it happen. After the spies are implicated in a terrorist attack in Moscow, which destroyed the Kremlin, they went first to Dubai and then to Mumbai to clear their names by catching this guy ""red-handed"".The music, the military uniforms, and all other intangibles - all this suggest to us a militaristic, aggressive, and anti-Western nature of Russia. The crazed Russian politician - curiously -- has a Germanic name ""Kurt"". Thus, the remorseful scriptwriters Nemec and Appelbaum have fused the pre-supposed ""Prussian militarism"", and perhaps quasi-Nazi ideas with the Russian ""Oriental Despotism"" and the ostensible technological backwardness of Russia.That the Russians are backward is emphasized by the clich&eacute; that ostensibly nothing in Russia works (for example, the ""pay-phone"" scene). They also can be easily fooled by Ethan Hunt, could pretend to be a Russian without them noticing it. The ethnic divisions have been exploited once more (why not?) -- between the Russians and Ukrainians, between Serbs and Croats. The spies' helper is Bogdan, which in Russia is considered a Ukrainian name. Tom Cruise was thrown into Moscow prison for, supposedly, shooting six Serbs who ostensibly had been involved in the ""ethnic cleansing"".In my view, there have been three slurring ""shots"" at the Russians: 1] for putting innocent people in prison (the rule of law is absent), 2] for having the nukes which are not secure enough (backwardness), 3] for not having the brains to come up with the devilish scheme themselves (unsophistication). Thus, we are presented with Swedish-German ""Kurt"" who came up with the crypto-fascist idea to clean the Earth form the ""rabble"" using the Russian nuclear weapon. He pulls the strings in Kremlin, not even a native Russian guy.As usual with the Hollywood, all ""Russian"" scenes have been filmed in the Czech Republic. The producers didn't even bother to pick the native Russian speakers. Russian wasn't a native language of the ""Russians"" in prison scene and other ""Moscow"" scenes, except a single person - Vladimir Mashkov who played a Russian secret agent. All this looks and sounds really idiotic and incredibly patronizing. The movie is a collection of disconnected action ""packages"", TV series stitched together with white threads (Moscow-Dubai-Mumbai episodes). Appelbaum and Nemec's script are too jokey without being genuinely funny. In my opinion, they have created a dazzling array of techno-tricks that tries to be funny ""ad nauseam"" while making caricatures of the other cultures.",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

455725,"These are the guys I wish I could be-- minus Worm! Matt Damon was incredible in this movie that showcased elite poker players so well. The direction and technical advice were stellar and I don't think there has ever been a movie quite like it. Despite this, I found it unrealistic that he would put everything in the pot while betting against the Russian. Yet his loss served as a lesson for him towards the end of the film.The DVD commentaries were great in the version I had. All of the clowns who rated this movie One-Star bought the innital version from the late 1990s and thus missed the later versions. This is the best poker movie I've ever seen set in contemporary times. There were a few I loved set in the 1800s and 1930s thru 1950s, but this was the best of them all.Matt Damon is an incredible actor and an even better person. I'd love to see a sequel to this movie. Where is Worm today in 2012? Did Damon's character win the World series of Poker or did e return to law school? Hats off to the costars of this movie. Martin Landau is a Hall of Fame Actor as is Edward Norton.See this movie and you won't be disappointed!A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.",Rounders VHS

1327777,"I never saw Lost when it was on TV, and then my son bought the DVDs separately and I watched them after he was finished. I was mesmerized; I immediately became an instant Lost fan.  The anticipation of waiting for the DVDs from my son was driving me crazy. After watching the last DVD I couldn't believe there was no more ""Lost"" to watch. I literally was having ""Lost"" withdrawal.And so, I purchased ""Lost: The Complete Collection"" and watched every minute of ""Lost"" again.  I just finished, and I am already having ""Lost"" withdrawal. Watching it a second time you pick up things you didn't in the firsr go around.The actors picked to play the roles of Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, and all the other regulars were perfect for the parts they played.  The story grips you from the beginning and you get ""lost"" in the story.  You can't wait to see the next DVD.  The story led me to wonder what exactly would I have done in a situation like the ones the characters found themselves in. It makes you think about whether you would be strong enough to be one of the survivors.The product that I purchased is wonderful.  Even the box holding the DVDs, a booklet with descriptions of the different scenes and the game Jacob and his brother played are wonderful.I would not hesitate in the least to purchase this product, but alas there are no more DVDs to watch, and I know I will be watching a third time because the storyline grips you and holds you interest and attention from the first DVD until the last.",N/A

1309505,"Resident Evil:Afterlife(released Sept/10)is the fourth live action movie of the franchise and from my point of view it is a step up from its' predecessor ""Apocalypse"".The action is hot and heavy,the S/FX are excellent and Milla Jovovich keeps the proceedings well grounded;her character fits her like a glove.The plot in Afterlife continues where Apocalypse left off.Alice(Jovovich) and her clones from the Umbrella facility in the desert in the U.S. are in Tokyo,Japan and on a mission to destroy the main facility led by Albert Wesker(Shawn Roberts).The clones do most of the dirty work,many getting taken out in the process.Wesker manages to escape in a Black Ops VTOL craft but the original Alice is aboard.Wesker nukes the Tokyo facility from the air but Alice and he duke it out on the aircraft.Alice gets injected with a serum that neutralizes the T-Virus and she becomes human once more.However before either of them can do anything,the aircraft,unpiloted during this time,plunges into the side of a Japanese mountain.Alice is the only one who seemingly walks away from the crash alive.The scene now switches to Alice who has commandeered an aircraft.She has flown across the Pacific and is heading for Arcadia,Alaska,the place mentioned from Apocalypse that was supposedly infection free.She lands in a field chock full of abandoned aircraft of all types and no one is around.She wanders to a beach but before long is attacked.It turns out to be Claire(Ali Larter) who has a strange metal spider-like device attached to her chest.Alice removes it but Claire,obviously heavily drugged,cannot remember Alice or much else.Alice loads Claire into the two seater plane and both head south along the Pacific coast.In L.A. they encounter a small group on a rooftop who are signaling for help.They cannot land below as it is surrounded by the undead.It's a nail biting sequence but she manages to land successfully on the roof top.This is the ""Citadel"" prison but they cannot stay too long here as the undead are slowly starting to find ways into the supposedly impregnable facility.In the facility the group is holding one prisoner,a military man,Chris(Wentworth Miller),who got caught up in the exodus of his long gone comrades.He has a way out and,realizing they don't have many options left,the group finally releases him.Upon release Chris looks at Claire and introduces himself as her brother.He tries to hug her but Claire not recognizing him,puts him in a back hand lock.She releases him at Alice's insistence and Alice tells Chris she cannot remember much due to her past ordeal in Arcadia.Things are going from bad wot worse in the facility.""Knocking"" at the main gate is a huge brute wielding a king sized axe and many of the undead have now mutated into new forms.The newest are now tunneling their way into the Citadel through the walls as they have tentacles that emanate out of their mouths.Not only great for digging but it's how they grasp their victims.The group heads downwards to the sewers,which will lead them to the ocean.Off the coast lies their destination.It is a ship called the Arcadia.This seems to be the source of the transmissions for safe refuge that Alice and the others have been receiving all along,not in Alaska.They get a boat and board the ship;it seems deserted.Below decks lies huge long containers which contain the answers to some of their questions.It seems the Umbrella corporation has been snatching survivors and putting them in cryogenic freezing for further experimentation.A little farther along they run into none other than Wesker who has been waiting for Alice and her compatriots.Wesker has been monitoring Alice all along and he has now infected himself with the T-virus and hopes with an infusion of the blood Alice carries he can successfully control the bad side of the virus.Alice of course has other plans.First she dispatches his two ""dogs"";also mutants whose heads split open to reveal the creature inside.After their demise she,Claire and her brother finally ""subdue"" Wesker.They release the rest of the cryo-frozen cargo of uninfected but Wesker,thought dead,escapes in a VTOL.He has the same plans to destroy the ship as he did the facility in Japan but this time Alice is one step ahead of him.She has planted a nuclear device on his aircraft which sends Wesker to meet his maker.Alice sends out a radio broadcast to all survivors who may out there offering now a true refuge for them aboard the Arcadia.The movie ends with a slew of VTOL black ops aircraft heading towards the boat as Alice says:""Here comes trouble"".With that ending we can see another sequel on the horizon,that is for sure.If the producers can keep up their sure fire and imaginative stories for this ever-burgeoning franchise,there is no where to go but up.After life is a definite improvement in story construction and plot evolvement over Apocalypse.The movie moves along at a more brisk pace and doesn't get bogged down in trivials like some its predecessors.Jovovich continues to be the glue that grounds this franchise.She is firmly ensconced in her Alice character and I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the great job she has done so far.This movie also has a plethora of special effects in it and the stunt work is amazing.The film certainly and more than once,references the ground breaking work of the Matrix but Afterlife still stands on its own.Technically the film has been transferred wonderfully to DVD and is clear and crisp.It appears in its' original a/r of 2:35:1 but is NOT in 3-D,as originally shot.However this lack of 3-D is no deterrent to the films enjoyability.As an aside I cannot wait until this 3-D craze runs its course and disappears from the scene once more.Wearing glasses at a theatre is one thing but at home constantly?......C'mon!!! .Extras include: commentary,trailer,previews,a two featurettes on the action and the cast.Afterlife is a very good sequel in the Resident Evil franchise,a better turn than its predecessor.The action is swift and sure and the special effects are,once more,top notch.Milla continues in her franchise-grounding role as Alice.Recommended.",N/A

Perhaps this could be attributed to the oppressive government under which the film takes place (people disappear, raids ""just happen"", etc.) but a bit of artistic license would have been appreciated by this viewer to create a better narrative flow.  I felt somewhat taken in because of our cultural inability to accept lesbian sex - this always seems to raise a film's cache unnecessarily.

1379464,"Loose Cannons is a beautiful movie about a young gay man in a large, loving and eccentric Southern Italian family. His plan to free himself from the family pasta business by coming out as gay misfires early in the movie, and the remaining ninety minutes cover how his dilemma is resolved.But this is far, far more than a coming-out movie. Themes of life and death and immortality and family and love lost and found run like deep, rich rivers of life throughout the story, and it is astonishing how much emotional ground is covered so effectively in just one movie. Each one of the dozen or so highly differentiated characters is fully and richly developed, and not one of them is short-changed or stereotyped.I got Loose Cannons because I have loved the earlier works of Ferzan Ozpetec, particularlyHis Secret Life,Facing Windows,Sacred Heart, and - most of all -Saturn in Opposition, but Loose Cannons surpasses them all. Each of its predecessors had minor flaws and occasional weak moments, but Loose Cannons has none.As usual in his movies, photography, sets and music are highly original and perfectly fitted to the story: if it were a silent movie it would be beautiful just to look at; if it were a radio program it would be delightful just to listen to. This is the first of his movies to integrate a significant amount of comedy into his usually serious but highly imaginative dramas, and he does it expertly; I laughed out loud almost as often as I wept with delight.This movie is a masterpiece. I cannot imagine how a better movie could ever be made, but Ozpetec is young still, so I am confident he will do it somehow. I can say without any reservation at all that this is the best movie I have ever seen.(In Italian with excellent English subtitles, but the Italian DVD available as of May 2011 has no subtitles for the extensive extra materials.)",N/A

1300870,"BURLESQUE, written and directed by Steve Antin, is a terrific cinematic definition of what the word 'burlesque' means: 'a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which itself derives from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery.'  This is a riot of color and good fun and snazzy production numbers a la Bob Fosse takeoffs. The story is predictable and silly and the script borders on mediocre, but with the talent and pizzazz of the cast, none of that matters!Ali (Christine Aguilera) flees Iowa in hopes of a career in show biz and happens into a Sunset Strip Burlesque House run by 'still not down' Tess (Cher) who knows her business is failing, despite the solid help from her gay assistant Sean (Stanley Tucci) and the warnings of her ex-husband/partner Vince (Peter Gallagher).  Tess has problems with some of her lip-synching cast, namely Nikki (Kristen Bell), and is being hounded to sell her club to the wealthy boyfriend of Nikki - Marcus (Eric Dane).  Ali observes, wants to be in the show, but is offered the job of waitress in the club by bartender/songwriter Jack (Cam Gigandet), a guy so kind that he shares his little flat with her.  Ali is persistent and when given a chance to audition she gets into the cast. Her trump card is that she is such a terrific singer that she converts the club away from lip-synching into a full-blown song and dance place.  Romance of course flutters in as do other little sidebars (including a strange quickie by doorman Alexis (Alan Cumming), but the main attractions are the glitzy stage numbers by a surprisingly fine Aguilera and by Cher herself.  It is all very corny and very wonderful entertainment.  Definitely worth an evening's pleasure.  Grady Harp, March 11",N/A

Although I liked Rec, I didn't care for The Last Broadcast or Clover Field (I figure it's kinda bad when you root for the monster) It's fair when people compare this film to the first, absolutely fair. This one didn't scare me as much as the first, but the tension and suspense was much greater. I'm not a fan of the mythology they seem to have created, but only because it seemed to come out of the need to create a series of films rather than actual organic storytelling. With a lesser quality film I would have no quibble. Which is good and bad.

1454271,"This was a truly unique movie, and the young star, Saoirse Ronan, puts in an exceptional performance that will hopefully lead to much more to come for her. She is gorgeous and ethereal on screen, with a face that subtly displays every emotion, without overacting. It's hard to say too much about the plot of this movie without spoiling it, so I won't, but basically Eric Bana plays her father, and the movie starts with them in a remote, frozen tundra where he is training her as an assassin or warrior of some type, although we don't really know why. Cate Blanchett also stars, as an intelligence officer somehow embroiled in what is going. The movie is an action adventure, but the pacing, filming, music, and soulfulness are more indie than blockbuster, and the entire thing really hinges on the performance of Saoirse Ronan, who more than pulls it off.I was engaged all the way through, but my husband found it a bit slow and dull in parts. I was OK with the pacing - I appreciated the more nuanced character development, which you don't usually see in action films - but I did think the ending lacked a bit. While I welcome the attempt to not simply tie everything up in a neat little bow, in this case a little too much was left unexplained, IMHO. So that's the only reason I give it 4, rather than 5, stars. But definitely worth seeing.",N/A

In secret agent, a young soldier is summoned by his superiors, and finds out that he has been listed in the newspapers as having been killed in action. John Gielgud is excellent in this role, and is complimented by the lovely Madeleine Carroll, a thrill seeking agent who stars as his ""wife"". Robert Young, more known for his roles in musicals and a few crime dramas, plays the part of an American, and the ""third man"" in this movie, invoking more than a passing interest in Carroll. The plot twists and turns are well worked out, and the whole movie is worth watching. Peter Lorre is especially at his best, as a bloodthirsty Spanish agent working with Gielgud and Carroll.

1422526,"""Gaumont Treasures, Volume 2""  is a three-disc collection of over 75 restored films produced by the French Gaumont Film Company between 1908 and 1916, its second decade of existence.  Gaumont originally dealt in photographic apparatus, but began producing short films in 1897 to promote its make of camera/projector.The movies in this set feature some of the company's most influential filmmakers, including Emil Cohl, cinema's first notable animator.  Cohl explored various forms of two-dimensional animation, pixillation, puppetry, and double exposure, sometimes blending live action with animation, laying the groundwork for other innovators such as Winsor McCay and Walt Disney.Other filmmakers represented include Jean Durand, whose specialty was slapstick comedy and American-style Westerns, and Jacques Feyder, whose sophisticated comedies made him the French counterpart to Ernst Lubitsch and Cecil B. DeMille.Watching these early shorts, I was amzed to see such inventiveness and creativity.  Though made at the dawn of the cinema age, these little movies display the potential of a new art form that would soon dominate popular culture worldwide.",Gaumont Treasures Vol. 2: 1908-1916

I watched this DVD in the span of one weekend (left work at 2pm on saturday, and only paused to do three things; shower, sleep and go to church)I must warn that I have not watched the full version because it has not been screened in my country. However, I decided to buy the DVD because of the main characters, Colunga, Navarro and Lucero, who I love!! I have seen complaints from other buyers who thought that they were going to get the full episodes, only to be disappointed when they realised that the DVD is an abridged version. Caveat Emptor - These telenovela DVDs are all abridged and are not a full replication of what you saw on TV. Please note that before you get disappointed!!!Now to the DVD. As with these abridged telenovelas, the storyline moves fast, and thank heaven that it does. There may be a tendency to drag while the show is on TV, but on the DVD the story moves fast, and keeps you in suspense. That's why I had to finish it in a weekend. Too much excitement!! I do not know if other loves scenes or romantic moments were excluded from the DVD, but it felt just fine as I watched. They concentrate on the main Plot A characters and not the town gossips of maids and other Plot B and C characters.The DVD itself comes in a good package and the quality of the DVD's is better now that Vivendi is doing them, as opposed to Xenon.As much as I am satisfied with the DVD, I am annoyed at Televisa for three things; for producing abridged versions of these novelas instead of the full versions, restricting the DVD's to Region 1 (USA and Canada), and the subtitles!! Why abridge the novelas? Do they think that we cannot afford the full versions, or that the sales of novelas to TV networks worldwide will reduce? I do not understand the business sense in their decisions!!!Why do they also restrict the DVD region to USA and Canada? I am in Kenya, Region 4, and I have a PS3 (region 2). I had to buy another DVD player that can play all regions, just to watch these DVDs I got. Please take a cue from the K-Drama DVDs. They produce region-less DVDs and they put the ENTIRE K-Drama on DVD. They do not abridge the show!!!Thirdly, they need to put subtitles in other languages apart from English. These novelas are popular around the world and in countries where they do not speak English. I am sure these other fans feel left out when they see that the DVD only has English subtitles!! Do something about that!!Overall analysis. I liked the DVD, I am happy with my DVD, the packaging is good, and I will definately buy more DVD's in the future.",N/A

And I readily admit that this is not nearly as bad a movie as that would make it out to be; it's paling in comparison to the company it's been keeping on my retinas. It's not the worst movie I watched that weekend, even (that would be the execrable 2008 remake of It's Alive), but it's derivative, badly-acted and -directed and all-around silly.

After dithering on so many other houses, when she says ""we'll take it"", Jim is thrilled he can finally stop looking at houses, and they do. Deborah soon learns that the house was originally inhabited by a reclusive, possibly crazy, painter who may or may not have killed his entire family and hidden them somewhere in the house. More importantly, their spirits may be trapped in the house's mirrors. (You've heard this before, right?)It gets better. The big twist ending has been done to death. In fact, the movie is often compared, and never favorably, to a classic flick that has the same twist ending. It's also been done more recently in two excellent movies, and I'm not even considering the genre classic that started it all, and the almost-as-excellent homage to it that came out thirty years later. (I'm avoiding names in order to avoid spoilers; if you want to know the films I'm talking about, they'll be at the bottom of the review after spoiler space.) As well as, naturally, any number of dozens of movies that have tried it and failed miserably. This is only one of a huge crop. It doesn't help that few of the actors in this movie are any good, and those who are are relegated to stereotype roles at best (Lupe Ontiveros is the most visible member of this cast in that regard). Writer/director Pablo Proenza was working on his first feature-length movie. He's not an awful director, and maybe if he'd had some original material and a few decent actors to work with, he might have come up with something worthwhile. This ain't it. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOWFor the record, and if this roster doesn't give away the twist ending, then I can't help you.""In fact, the movie is often compared, and never favorably, to a classic flick that has the same twist ending.""

857714,"Let me preface this review by saying a review should include all aspects of the DVD, from content to quality of packaging to digital transfer.  The fact I think Next Gen is one of comprehensively best Sci-Fi shows possibly in the history of television is the only reason this piece of crap set even gets two stars.  So, as a disclaimer, if you've never watched the TNG, then you owe it to yourself to wade through this junk if for no other reason the fantastic content of the show.  Especially towards the end of the series, this matured into a show that is near and dear to my heart, and I love the characters and the universe they inhabit.So, as for the rest: pure, unadulterated horse manure. I'm not kidding, I have old episodes I VHS taped from basic cable on medium tape speed that look better than the transfer they've done on these.  Its horrid.  Artifacts abound, the Dolby 5.1 is all over the place, there is more ghosting than a reality haunted house show...I could go on, but the summation is, they put little to no effort whatsoever into making this even digital quality (except for the menus).  Speaking of reality TV, it is insulting that reality TV drivel get regular Bluray releases and this, an 8 season series with history on both ends and a huge fan-base, get what could possibly be the fastest production mastering of any DVD release to date.  I think they stuck the interns on this project.The packaging, while getting regular blasting on the reviews, seems ok to me - its not great, but it'll hold em all, in a compact way, which if you have an extensive DVD collection, you know already takes up WAY too much space.  Searching for a disc is a pain, I'll give you that.  I'll use TNG Companion to help navigate to the episode(s) I'm looking for, but they could've made it easier on us.Don't be surprised, buyer, by the quality of the video though, I know many complain about imperfections on DVDs, but seriously, I thought I had gotten a bad Chinese bootleg copy.  Apparently, this is as good as it gets.",N/A

439104,"Airport (1970) may not have been the first disaster film, but it was the first one that was a huge commercial success, and launched the genre that would become extremely popular in the 70's.  The drama concerns the activities one night at Lincoln International Airport in Chicago during a raging snowstorm.  While following the routine matters related to commercial flight, the movie also features the personal stories of various characters, and the captivating Oscar winning performance of Helen Hayes as stowaway Ada Quonsett.  After the stage has be set, a suicidal bomber is introduced, turning what had been largely a battle against the elements, into a taught tale of suspense.  The all-star cast also includes Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster, George Kennedy, Van Heflin, Jean Seberg, Jacqueline Bisset, Maureen Stapleton, Barry Nelson, and Dana Wynter.One reason the film resonated with viewers, is because flying is a universal experience, and also because the phenomenon of terrorism and skyjacking was a frightening reality at the time.  Based on Arthur Hailey's novel, the screenplay was co-written by Hailey and George Seaton, who also directed the film.  Most of the drama concerning the characters is kind of sappy, but not that of D. O. Gurrero (Heflin), who plans to kill himself, so that his wife Inez (Stapleton) can claim his insurance money.  Scraping together the last of his cash to pay for flight insurance, Gurrero boards a plane bound for Rome, with the intention of setting off a briefcase bomb somewhere over the Atlantic.Seated next to Gurrero is the incorrigible Ada Quonsett, who has sneaked aboard hoping to get to New York to visit her daughter.  The Trans Global fight turns around after receiving word about a possible bomb on board.  Then with the cooperation of Ms. Quonsett, Captain Demerest (Martin) and stewardess Gwen Meighen (Bisset) attempt to get Gurrero's briefcase.  Gwen manages to grab the case, but another passenger gets in the way, allowing Gurrero to get it back.  Then just when Demerest has almost convinced Gurrero to give up, the same jerk passenger shouts ""Grab him...He's got a bomb"", sending the panicked Gurrero into the lavatory where he sets off his bomb.The special effects are simple but effective, as the setting inside the cabin is very tight and intimate, and aside from being extremely well lighted, seems pretty realistic.  Because of the weather, the plane has to land back in Chicago, where TWA's chief mechanic Joe Patroni (Kennedy) and airport manager Mel Bakersfield (Lancaster), manage to clear a key runway.  The film's rather sedate ending, would be something that would become atypical in the years to follow, as more destructive tension filled landings would become an all too common movie clich&eacute;.With its wide focus, Airport still manages to tell a story pretty well, giving depth to some key characters.  Helen Hayes really does carry the first part of the film with a delightful performance, and she has a key role aboard the plane.  Maureen Stapleton was also nominated for an Academy Award.  Jean Seberg, Van Heflin, and Dean Martin, are also very good.Along with The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Earthquake (1974), and The Towering Inferno (1974), Airport is a must see for anyone interested in the genesis of disaster film genre.  The 30th Anniversary Remastered edition is the one to get, as the video quality of the regular edition from 1999, is VHS quality.  Both editions are issued by Good Times Home Video, so check carefully which one you are getting.  Universal Pictures would follow up with three sequels,Airport 75,Airport '77, and The Concorde...Airport '79.",Airport VHS
1152389,"I'm a weather junkie. Short of a meteorology degree, I know a lot about supercell activity and tornado formation. This stuff is very interesting and I've always wanted to see a tornado in person, but I live in the wrong part of the country. In another life, perhaps.The point is; storm chasing is incredibly exciting. It's a visceral experience unlike anything else, and for some reason the people in this documentary just seem too cautious/unenthusiastic about the whole thing. It's off-putting. You can get better, more exciting footage of tornadoes by opening the outbreak segments of Wikipedia, looking at the lists and classifications of the known tornadoes from a particular outbreak, and scanning Youtube for the corresponding tornado with (mostly) amateur footage of the storms.I mean, this guy Josh relies way too much on his computer models, and the irony is that within the very show he is shown to be wrong/having miscalculated numerous times. All the while, the rest of the team is viewing the actual weather with their eyes, and this meteorologist is contradicting them with computer models that ended up being wrong more than they're right. It's frustrating to watch, instead of fun. The culmination is when Josh, our buddy the ""always wrong overly cautious"" leader, improperly predicts storm formation to eastern Kansas, while Sean, the intuitive ""photographer"" storm chaser accurately calls development to the south. That development resulted in one of the worst tornadoes in history, the Greensburg tornado. Obviously storm chasing isn't an exact science and mistakes are a given, but this guy makes so many mistakes throughout some of the episodes that it kind of hampers the enjoyment of it. Ultimately, the stormchasers that rely a bit more on intuition and experience are much more engaging to watch and because the leader of this series is a cautious, conservative ""radar watcher,"" the show suffers from it and is less interesting than it should be.To be honest, as annoying as he is, I actually prefer the videos Reed Timmer makes. He's a lot younger, more enthusiastic and focused, and more willing to take the risks which often result in larger payoffs/better footage. I'm not saying with something like storm chasing that being a wild card is better, but I get the impression in this series that the chasers here are just a little too cautious and a little too focused on their instrumentation rather than the epic views of the vicious weather all around them.The show is not bad, but it could (and should) be much better.",Storm Chasers/Perfect Disaster
1428725,"FILM RATING:  4 starsThe best movie I've seen in 2011 so far is Sarah's Key (2010). This French-English import is one of those little ""sleeper"" movies that totally surprises you and blows you away when you see it. Sarah's Key has a very emotional core to it that really looks into the human condition from multiple perspectives. And it searches for the ""truth"" within. This is a movie much in the vein of Schindler's List (1993), The Pianist (2002), The Reader (2008), and The English Patient (1996). It's not exactly ""light"" fare. But it's also not quite as dark as Schindler's List or The Pianist. I found the weaving of the two main story lines, one past and one present, to be perfect. It's not always easy for a filmmaker to pull together past and present set stories, with actors playing the same character at various ages, but director Gilles Paquet-Brenner found a way to do it brilliantly. And the same can be said for the way he weaves together both French and English languages into the movie. I never felt like I was ""working"" to follow the dialogue through reading subtitles. Granted, the movie is only partially subtitled. Parts of it are in English and parts are in French.The story centers around the events of the French round-up of its own Jewish citizens in July 1942. That's right...the French, not the Germans. Of course I'm sure the French were feeling pressure from the Germans during the time. And yet it's hard to overlook the fact that the French were just as guilty of genocide as the Germans and Russians. One can truly understand why there was a ""World"" war at this time. Sarah's Key is simply sharing another piece of the puzzle that we've been reluctant to look at until recently because of how ugly the puzzle is. The impact of this ugly mindset at the time spreading from country to country across the globe must have been like a virus, gradually infecting each host and getting them from within. The opening scenes with the capture of Sarah's family and their move to an internment camp at Auschwitz are gripping to say the least. Sarah, played brilliantly by young actress M&eacute;lusine Mayance, makes a choice on how to save her younger brother from the horrors she anticipates will fall upon them. But that choice has consequences, as we soon find out. I don't want to give too much of the story away, since it is much better to let the movie unfold it for you.Kristin Scott Thomas plays a modern journalist, investigating this historic incident, while at the same time unravelling a very personal and ironic connection to it. The film does require that you let go of what could be too ""coincidental"" for reality. But remember, this is a fictional movie at the end of the day, inspired by real events. And movies by their very nature, are contrived to some degree. I never found myself getting lost in my mind thinking about how unrealistic some of the story arcs were. Instead, I simply felt emotionally engaged in the suspenseful and thrilling discovery of all of the secrets that Sarah's Key possesses. And I credit all of the talented artists who contributed to making that possible in this film. The writing, editing, cinematography, production design, acting, music and sound are top notch for this small indie film rumored to be made for less than $10 million. Sarah's Key is an amazing accomplishment for so little money, and a reminder to Hollywood that it's not the size of the budget of a movie that really matters for its quality. To me its the assembly and collaboration of many talented people unified to tell a great story.There are two scenes that really stand out for me in the film. The first being the opening with Sarah and her brother tickling and giggling with each other under the covers in bed. The director is clearly showing us the innocent fun times of childhood. The camera work there and that little slice of ""happy"" to start the film with are an incredible contrast to the darker more ""adult"" tone of the rest of the film. The second scene that really caught my eye is when Sarah and a fellow young female companion are floating in a murky, muddy river, cleansing themselves. Both of these scenes are just small, idealized, dreamy cinematic sequences that on their own, offer needed artistic moments of escape from the story. Within any horrific context, there's always still something beautiful to be discovered and seen if one looks for it. And director Paquet-Brenner shares that.Music composer Max Richter has created an unbelievably perfect music score for Sarah's Key that not only elevates the film, but is an incredible work to listen to all on its own. The score has mostly a classic sound to it, but Richter also incorporates bits of modern music composition and style as well. It's one of the best film scores I've heard in years. Within the film, the score gives many scenes their emotional gravity, as is typically the case. But something about Richter's music here stands out from the typical score. And you'll know it when you hear it.I could spend a lot more time discussing the themes, ideas and incredible filmmaking prowess present in Sarah's Key, but I firmly believe in letting movies speak for themselves as well. I've given you a little to chew on and hopefully inspire you to see this film, even though on the surface (or by its book cover), Sarah's Key looks like a ""heavy"" film. I challenge you to watch it and grab on to it in some manner. It's movies like this that really give cinema its name. And I'm glad to see that we are still making these films, especially within the broader worldwide cinematic context we are now within.At the end of Sarah's Key, my eyes were red from the tears that flowed throughout the film. And my mind was speechless as I just embraced the very strong emotional connection I felt with the story and the film. I'm personally always looking for movies that can give me that kind of experience. Don't get me wrong, I love the epic, action-filled extravaganzas like Inception (2010) and Saving Private Ryan (1998) as well. But it's small films like Sarah's Key that more often fill my cinematic diet now with the nutrition that I need.",N/A
495373,"I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978), also known as DAY OF THE WOMAN, is a great exploitation film, and a thrilling movie for people who like revenge pictures.  This film actually shares the same plot as KILL BILL, and KILL BILL gets all kinds of awards and accolades, while I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE gets crushed by the critics, especially Roger Ebert, who called the film ""vile trash.""  For me, the film is just about perfect.  By the way, anybody who says they're surprised and sickened by what happens on screen should have known what the film was about when going to see it.  The reason is because the advertising for the movie was very direct:  ""This woman will soon beat, chop, burn, strangle 5 men beyond recognition, and no jury in American would dare convict her.""  So the film is a simple rape and revenge film, and a great one at that.  Difficult and intense, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE ultimately felt liberating because she DOES get her revenge, and it's only a movie, so for me, the whole thing works.",N/A
1431875,"Strange, all of the negative reviews, and this is why:The trailers made it as clear as the nose on your face as to the type of movie this was going to be. There was no guesswork. There were no assumptions to be had or conjectures to assimilate. It was not meant to be rocket-science by any stretch of the hyphenated word. It was CUT-AND-DRY as to what we were to expect from ""Your Highness.""So why, in all that is holy, would the negative-reviewing knuckleheads even remotely entertain the thought of attending a movie like this and then expect anything other that what was in the previews? That puzzle is one for the high-thinkers, the philosophers, those involved with the aesthetics of human thought and its subsequent actions. But I have come up with a few theories of my own concerning those goofballs and their reasoning behind reviewing a movie like this:1. They enjoy negativity and go about life on a day-to-day basis doing everything they can to seek out stuff to criticize and then following through with it.2. They lack self-esteem and need to be critical of anything and everything that contains humor so that those who are subject to their criticism may experience a bit of what they feel deep inside of their afflicted, dismayed, and moth-eaten souls. It probably gives them a brief pseudo-sense of purpose, which, of course, is better than having to live with themselves and listening to their own poisonous thoughts for a brief moment in time.3. They are big pessimistic bags of garbage, spewing darkness into the world on a daily basis, and they really should not be going to movies like this for the simple fact that, in their case, it takes MORE facial muscles to smile than it does to frown.""Your Highness"" had no secrets about the type of movie is was going to be. And everything I expected from it I was given ten-fold. It was hilarious and very tongue-in-cheek at times, it was lewd and crude at other times, and it was bold and meaningful at, still, other times, making for an exceptionally executed movie, rife with hilarity and teeming with nonsensical amusement. The medieval backdrop added wholly to the film's atmosphere as well.Don't listen to the nay-sayers, folks. ""Your Highness"" comes recommended to all those who can find their own funny bone without effort. It is for people of substance, who like to escape that substance from time to time. It is for the optimistic, glass-is-half-full type of person. It is for those who have no problem laughing at something that is MEANT for laughter and not lame, thin-lipped dissections.All of the actors in this film were clearly having a good time during filming. Natalie Portman was a knockout and always seemed just a frame or two away from cracking up, and I'm almost positive she did many times after the director yelled, ""Cut!"" Danny McBride was perfect in his obsequious and cowardly performance. And James Franco pulled off the good-son, hero role with ecstatic ease. Other prominent actors were spotted throughout and played their parts with perfection. The writing was good, the directing was top-notch, and overall the production was A-material.As the title of my review suggests, be a yay-sayer, not a nay-sayer!AND FOR YOU BLU-RAY ENTHUSIASTS OUT THERE:PQ: Outstanding! Detail was exquisite, the blacks were nice and inky! Looked simply spectacular on my plasma!AQ: Even better!

She meets some other girls her age there and then she begins to realize that some dark force is keeping them from ever getting a chance to leave alive. The acting from all the girls is good, with Amber Heard turning in her best performance.

One of the main characters is constantly trying to make money through a side business that he hides from the fort commander.

1372582,"2011's ""Red Riding Hood"" is a Grimm's fairy tale reset as a suspenseful monster saga for modern teenagers.  It features a good ensemble cast, atmospheric sets and music, and a love story wrapped around a murder mystery.The story opens in a medieval village, nestled in an almost mythical mountain landscape surrounded by dark snowy forests.  The village has been haunted for generations by a werewolf, who is held at bay by sacrifices of livestock.  A young woman named Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) faces a more pressing personal dilemma.  She is betrothed to the well-off but dull Henry, but holds her heart for poor but handsome chum Peter.The abrupt murder of Valerie's sister by the werewolf changes everything.  The villagers hunt the werewolf, and come back with a head.  To their sorrow, they will find they are mistaken, a fact pointed out by Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), a ruthless priest who hunts werewolves with a group of commando-like warriors.The plot cleverly hands out all kinds of clues and suspects; it would be a sharp-eyed viewer who picks out the killer in advance.  Valerie herself is a suspect, and faces some terrible choices on the way to a thrilling conclusion.  Recommended.",Red Riding Hood (DVD)
1436877,"Sometimes movies have concepts so grand and large-scale that potential viewers can't help but imagine to themselves in advance what they would do with such technology, powers, knowledge, etc.  Imagine if you had the ability to travel through time.  What would you do?  When would you go?  Our imaginations are sparked, and thus, movies about time travel are often disappointing, because their reach never achieves what we'd imagine ourselves doing.LIMITLESS suffers from this as well.  Bradley Cooper plays an author with a serious case of writer's block.  He's smart, but messy and disorganized.  He's handsome but can't be bothered to take care of his appearance.  And he can't get going on the book he's supposed to write.  His girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) is finally tired of him and leaves.  But hope arrives in the form of a new drug that he is given by a distant acquaintance.  It will allow him to access ""100% of his brain.""  Suddenly he's got phenomenal cognitive abilities...particularly the ability to take random scraps of past things he's encountered and to put them together into patterns that no one else can recognize.  It's like the chess player who can envision every possible move and the outcomes of each of those moves.  Cooper finishes his book (and it's brilliant) and then sets about making some serious money with his new powers.With such incredible powers, he seems to strive to accomplish relatively little.  Yes, he wants to make money...that is certainly understandable and relatable.  But he doesn't see a big pattern for himself.  And as a viewer, I was constantly distracted by thinking...""wow, if I had HIS abilities, I'd do so much more.""  It felt a little bit like a failure of the imagination on the part of the filmmakers.  Thus, I felt vaguely disappointed in the film...a great idea that boiled down to a somewhat predictable ""corporate espionage"" kind of thing.Because Cooper discovers that this drug wasn't exactly developed with the approval of the FDA.  The side-effects, particularly of not taking the drug every day, are unpleasant.  And there are some unpleasant, even murderous folks who want the drug, or at least want the abilities that Cooper now has to work to their advantage.  Who can he trust?  How will he get away from all the folks who are now following him?  What will he do when his stock of pills runs out?It's all interesting but a bit generic.  Cooper makes a pretty good leading man here, but he generates little chemistry with the bland Abbie Cornish...so we are not terribly invested in their relationship.  Robert DeNiro is on hand to collect a paycheck as a big shot executive trying to pull of the most ambitious corporate merger in history...and he needs the talent Cooper brings to the table.The most amusing part of the movie is when Cooper has to borrow his initial stake in the stock market from a Russian loan shark, who inadvertently discovers the pill Cooper is taking.  Suddenly, this thuggish character becomes a LOT more dangerous to Cooper than the corporate big-shots.  This showed some creativity and the menace and humor of these scenes was welcome.I recommend LIMITLESS, but my admiration is not...well...limitless.  Cooper is good.  The basic concept is intriguing.  The ""action"" shenanigans are fairly tense, but feel lifted from hundreds of movies that came before.  I realize this is a lazy thing to say, but I'd say wait until it comes out on DVD.",Limitless

1366031,"poor intro to the story using a narrative and the ending was likewise a disappointment. I believe we have the director to blame for some of the failure in this movie such as having Jeff Bridges over do trying to sound gruff. In the middle of the movie where a little more of his natural voice was allowed, it was actually an improvement to the experience of the movie. The gal that plays Mattie had some bright spots with her expressions, but the haggling scene came up short in comparison to the original. I'm not a huge John Wayne fan, BUT when he did something right.....he flat did it extremely well and the same goes for Duvall and the rest of the cast of characters in the original. Matt Damon started out well but then was no better than Glenn Campbell and lacked in his performance.I blame the director for the shortcomings in this movie. Sure Barry Pepper is a great actor, but he just didn't carry the role as well as Duvall. Josh Brolin was ok, but again kept from doing it as well as he could. It was obvious. It was as if all the actors were being held back from giving their best to follow the vision of the director who should stick to Sci-fi etc and forget about remaking a great classic western that was done so perfectly the first time around. I honestly don't know what the director was thinking. I live out west and the characters lacked the flavor, the spice and character of real life out here.John Wayne's True Grit captured all of it.My wife was also greatly disappointed in this film, so much so that she demanded I get the original along with Rooster Cogburn in case some fool decided to do a remake and screw that up as well.You expect more, you expect better, not in special effects, but in content and performance. The 1st True Grit is a 5 star plus film. This film was a sad disappointment and I'm glad I bought it cheap.",True Grit
1460668,"With a history aficionado (in general) and a World War II buff (in particular) on my holiday shopping list, I always face the inevitable crisis about what to get them. Arguably, HBO's 2001 miniseries ""Band of Brothers"" and the 2010 offering ""The Pacific"" are two of the most significant narrative works to emerge on the contemporary entertainment scene. Spearheaded by the powerhouse collective of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, these two massive enterprises showcase different aspects of the Great War. While initially dubious of the hefty price tag (although I picked one up when Amazon had it deeply discounted), there is no denying that the appearance of the Special Edition Gift Set is both handsome and deluxe. As a gift or if you don't already own the two shows, this would be an easy recommendation. However, if you do have one or both of the programs--I'm not sure that this qualifies as a necessary upgrade.I will make some comments about the programs for newbies in a moment, but let's get down to the facts for those who are already familiar with the two miniseries and just want to know about this specific item.Packaging: The DVD discs are placed within a large hardbound book with thick cardboard pages on which glossy photographs accompany the inserts. It's akin to having a coffee table book with DVDs inside. There are two discs housed on each two page spread (one side only) and I have no issues with too much glue or scratched discs which can be problematic in similar sets. It's really quite a nice layout. The book itself is then housed in a the simple box pictured which seals magnetically. Granted, the size of the overall package may not sit easily with your traditional DVD collection--but it is designed as a real centerpiece.DVDs: The two actual miniseries, with all previously released bonus material, are carried over from the prior individual releases. Each disc houses two episodes (both Band of Brothers and The Pacific run ten episodes or five discs). Each miniseries then has a Bonus disc. As I said, these features are the same as those previously released. This makes up 12 DVDs and a thirteenth has a new documentary feature.Principle bonus features carried over for Band of Brothers:""We Stand Alone Together"" DocumentaryRon Livingston's Video Diary""Making of"" FeaturetteNormandy Premiere FeaturettePrinciple Bonus Features carried over for The Pacific:""Profiles of the Pacific"" featurette""Making the Pacific"" featurette""Anatomy of the Pacific War"" featuretteOn Blu-ray only: An Enhanced Viewing Mode ExperienceNew Documentary: ""He Has Seen War."" This is a 53 minute feature that follows some of the veterans shown in both miniseries home as they reminisce about those homecoming experiences. It is bleak, sometimes painful, and a very emotional addition. It is very worthy to be seen--but if you already own both shows, it's not enough to drive a double dip purchase.""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"" represent very different components of the war. I won't synopsize either show as that information is widely available (and I've gone on way too long). Both are essential viewing in my opinion. Packaging them together makes a beautiful set.

462588,"In the aftermath of World War II, many Italian filmmakers pursued a much more sobering and truthful kind of cinema. Known as ""Italian Neorealism,"" the movement spawned a generation of non-romantic dramas about the harsh realities of life.Federico Fellini, who would later be known for cinematic theatricality, free-flowing style, and plot whimsy started in this movement. In the heartbreaking NIGHTS OF CABIRIA we see him true to that form...while straining to transcend it.CABIRIA stars Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina, in the title role. As she was in her husband's LA STRADA (1956), Masina is the female Charlie Chaplin...a screen comedienne for the ages. And it is within her flawless performance we find a character of true pathos, not a cartoon. Though Cabiria (Masina) lives as a prostitute on the streets of Rome, she always seems to find the goodness in others and in the dark world she inhabits.Facing endless disappointment and humiliation, Cabiria is broken and beaten and then broken again. And yet...she never stays down. Always, always, she rises to the next occasion. She perseveres. ""Dum spiro--spero.""Underscoring the pathos and pain of Cabiria's hard life and positive outlook is Nino Rota's (THE GODFATHER) stirring theme.",Nights of Cabiria VHS

194857,"I should get my biases out of the way:  I am a big 'Narnia' fan, both of the books, and, so far, of the movies.  The best measuring stick that the latter is up to par as a medium is to determine whether or not the celluloid versions provide a fluid and engaging adventure, and, if the movie offering retains a good measure of charm the books elicit.Now for 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,' there seemed to be plenty of both.  'Prince Caspian,' in my estimation was a better honed adventure, but it was at the expense of the charm factor.I must also confess, just like watching the first 'Star Wars' trilogy, reading the 'Narnia' Chronicles has me holding the first installment dear, but, objectively, as I thought the second film 'The Empire Strikes Back' did measurably better with dramatic unfolding, tension, and visual splendour, my objective favorite 'Narnia' book, short of 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' having all the wonder and magic of a first leg, I especially loved 'Voyage of the Dawn Treader' as the best of the seven (as the most complex, innovative, and transporting), so judging a movie rendition I thought would be a harsh affair.This is especially true when you consider how vividly C.S. Lewis has instilled the framed picture that is the portal of some surrealistically imaginative scenes.  How this movie captured the dark, unconscious voyage past the island where it is difficult to convey these edgy, nightmarish scenes with the skill of Lewis, I feared, would have been inadequate translation on the screen at best and disastrous at worst.Happily, I found the adventure to be well-honed like 'Prince Caspian,' without it being at the expense of that deep, dark voyage the vessel takes to an island of unconscious so dangerous to our young pilgrims.Beyond my expectations was the fine performance by young actor as the prodigy intellectual nuisance, cousin Eustace (Will Poulter)--scientific skepticism and agnostic or atheistic scorn in child form.  He is truly the medium or vessel that keeps the tension running in '...Dawn Treader' afloat.  Honorably mention goes to Georgie Henley (Lucy) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund) who were always the most interesting and best in the show the first two rounds.I'm not entirely sure why there are such tepid reviews for '...Dawn Treader' amongth the pro critics.  During the first round, some said there was wooden acting.  Now, even the actors as Susan and Peter (who are both marginalized in the book and the movie) seem more relaxed and at home with their roles.  Having stated this, I can only surmise that the critics are perhaps all 'Lord of the Rings,' 'Harry Potter'-ed, and 'Narnia'-ed out.Well edited, engagingly portrayed, and having the special effects with a trajectory that keeps our young heroes going, this 'Narnia,' may be the best in the series--in book or film form.  It is hard to imagine C.S. Lewis not being impressed with the marvels we have today--not merely the technology to do his works justice, but the execution and the young child actors who have visibly done what was necessary to bring his fantasy masterpiece to life.",N/A
1319963,"I am sad to see such negative ""catty"" reviews posted. It seems that most reviewers just don't ""get it"" and thus were not truly open to the message of the film. Yes, Liz is successful, beautiful, seems to have everything, made her choices...as we all have and do. I do not know what to say to convey the frustration I feel with a society who largely fails to see humanity and truth over the superficial and greed. This film is a HUGE message to all of us who are crabby (and as a result claim to call a judgement, ""review""), unsatisfied, confused, lost, frustrated, who continue to do the same things and expect different results...etc, etc, etc. Liz Gilbert's experience is a shared and universal one regardless of one's background or current worldly status. The film if you pay attention to the woman instead of the things around her, is inspirational in many ways. I am not rich in material goods, I've never had the privilege of owning a home in this country, and currently I do not have my health, but I know what it's like to work like crazy for empty and meaningless dreams to discover something more...search for growth. I applaud Liz's courage, abandonment of all she knew...step by step...to travel another road less traveled only to discover she was the love she was looking for all along. If only we all had such courage and optimism and fortitude, we'd be a much more kinder and compassionate society and world.",Eat Pray Love
468760,"What is amazing about this movie,  the strange underworld of one persons game creation... is that no one,  including the viewer, seems entirely comfortable with the concept of reality.  Whose game are we watching?  And has the game ended?  Did they kill someone?  Or were they all game characters?  I've watched it three or four times now.  And I am still not sure that they return to reality... I believe that was the directors intention.  I cannot understand how these reviews miss this.  The fact that it has a different name at the end,  Transcendenz,  this does not mean it was the 'real' game.  The room they are seated in,  like the room in the beginning,  is a very bizarre room to do a game text.  I have read that it is a nice film because the female lead is not just a reference for sex .  Sure,  thats good.  But thats not what makes the film great.As the couple enter each new level of this game,  the line between reality and game becomes more obscure.  The cast is wonderful,  and we are not embarressed by any goofy computer special effects.  Its justgood,  simple visual and clever writing.  The game world... so like ours.... We see her running her hand along a gas station wall,  we see him squeezing the leather or the velvetin a chair.  The characters are experiencing the textures and emotions of real life in this bizarre environment.  This film successfully translates our acceptance of the bizarre.  LIke children,  we accept whatwe are told is real.The story has a woman shut in who creates games,  a hero to gamers.  She is traveling inside her own game,  trying to fix her 'pod'  and the organic material used to make the pod and the game.  Animals are being mutilated to make the game parts,  and people walk like zombies from the forest to Chinese resteraunts.  The male character worries that he is accepting this as real.  He is concerned about the killing, and the well being of his body... reason in an unreasonable world...  He resonates an anti game playing personality in a resonable way.  The double agent who tries to kill her ( they are either yelling death to Reality or Death toExistenz) is supposedly the 'real'  game creator,  who worries about the anti game theme.  But the resonable young man turns out to be the real assasign of Jennifer,  the game game-creator.  then when she survives,  and kills him,  and yells death to reality,  the game apparently ends. Or does it?  Now they are in a new 'level'  which we think is real,  and yet I am not so sure.  They they kill this 'real'  game creator.  Or do they.In what appears to be reality,  we,  or rather they,  are taken back to a room that we began in in a GAME.  Can that be reality?  Now the people in the 'reality'  sit and watch without emotion pretty much like they watched people murdered back in the game.  When they kill the people in the 'real '  room,  the heros yell the same line they yelled in the game.  ""  DEATH TO..""  Is it not likely that their game characters are still in play?  And yet,  they seem do so real, especially when the Chinese guy says Guys,  are we still in the game?  and thats the point.  thats the terror,  thats the fantastic ending.  I read a review of this movie that said 'when the return to the Real game'  and thought what are you talking about?  YOu missed the point.  I think. ?  Did they return?  Are we still playing the game?I love this movie,  I think you will too. Like many great records,  and books,  this film is perhaps made for these times rather than the ones that did not understand them ten or twenty years before.",Existenz VHS

I was not watching PBS and British dramas in the late 70's so I am not familiar with any of the actors who star in the series. I am surprised it has not been re-made since it has alot of potential with the right cast and a better soundtrack. I am on disc three, so I am anxious to see how it wraps up.

It was around the time the Marvel had made deals with CBS to bring Characters like Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Doctor Strange to TV. You would think that they were going to be as well written and produced as the Hulk was, but alas, Captain America was not.The story was set in the late 1970's instead and used the idea that Steve Rogers had just gotten out of the Marines and was called in by a scientist that had worked with Steve's Father on a Steroid called F.L.A.G (Full Latent Ability Gain). The Steroid worked to increase the stregth of the person or animal ifused with it, but killed them in the end. The only one that could take it was Steve, because it was from his Father.

1386668,"I literally laughed aloud for most of the movie and haven't laughed that hard since I saw 'Tommy Boy' for the first time way back when.Brides Maids is a funny movie that really breaks the mold. In fact, I didn't want to watch it because of the title alone, as much as I've always liked Wiig. The title is reminicent of all those wedding related 'comedies' we've seen before: Best Friend's Wedding, 27 Dresses, and on and on. But the fact of the matter this really isn't a wedding movie at all (thank heavens). the wedding is just a vehicle to show the interaction between two good friends and all the craziness between them that makes a woman's life an intricate thing.Brides Maids is funny on several levels, which probably explains its' broad appeal. There's the easy gross out humor (the food poisoning scenes are painfully funny) but then there are subtle things like Wiigs' car (could a crappier car be found?), her failed cake store renamed by vandals (baby c*k s) and driving 'exposed' (but not completely) that show how much thought went into every sight gag, every line and every setup/punchline. What makes it better is that it's an ensemble piece where every actor hits it out of the park every time. Even the 'Air Marshall', who has only a few lines, pulls them off with knock out funny timing and attitude.Bridesmaids is undoubtedly the funniest 'all-girl' comedy I've ever seen and can stand toe-to-toe against any classic comedy out there.",N/A

I have seen Elton in concert at least 15 times but I have never him play a set this extensive.

Also rare is that fact that he is playing with an orchestra and choir in this concert.  The blu-ray image is clear, the sound great.  I own both the DVD and the Blu-ray, because the DVD contains ""Live, Rare & Unseen"" material that the blu-ray for some reason does not contain.  The upgrade to blu-ray is worth it for a better image quality only.  The sound and image on the regular DVD is excellent plus it has the extra material.  This is a MUST for anyone who loves Elton's music!",N/A

232066,I first saw this movie as a child (about six years old) during its initial theatrical release and find it as funny now as I did way back then. The comic timing of Ryan and Streisand is perfect. It is rare to find a film an entire family can watch together and all can truly enjoy. The climactic chase scene through the streets and back alleys of San Francisco will have you on the edge of your seat...laughing. An almost-forgotten gem of a movie.,N/A
932615,"If you've seen the OVA's then you pretty much know the main character Kenshin the fierce sword fighter who fought during Japans civil war and now seeks to try and find some peace after all the bloodshed he's been force to be part of in his early years. As we see Kenshin after the war we see he's renounced his former way of life and now tries to keep on the peaceful road going so far as to wear a reverse katana which as far as I can recall meant that the sharp edge of the blade is on the back of the katana not the front of it.  As Kenshin travels we get to see him meet a feisty young woman who his skilled in her own sword style as well as being the inheritor of her father's Dojo and seeks to reclaim its rightful spot as a school that teaches nobility and honor as well as the true way of the samurai which is to protect the weak and innocent.  After these two meet we see more people start to become part of Kenshin's group of friends and family even a former enemy of his.  The animation is very good though if you're expecting a lot of CGI effects are massive fights in every scene you're going to be disappointed as the animation doesn't employ the CGI effects but it doesn't detract the entertainment of the series either,  also while there are going to be fights scenes the basic story is trying to show Kenshin trying to live life away from that kind of brutality that he once was a part of.  The series dvd set case like the third set is annoying in that you have eight dvd disc put into a single plastic dvd case with flaps that have the disc overlay one atop another which is sure to get scratches on your dvds.  So if you're a fan of Samurai movies or animes here's a great series to look at for your anime collection....",Rurouni Kenshin - TV Series Season One
1377848,"ost of the other reviews have complained about the modifications to the film, so I'll talk about something else: the layout of the menu options. The way it's organized is really cumbersome. The bonus features are organized by movie, then by planet, then by type of feature. Given that the only reason many people bought this set was to see the deleted scenes, it just means having to go through many layers to get to the deleted scenes, then you have to backtrack to see the deleted scenes for EACH planet. I can't imagine who thought organizing the features by planet was a good idea. To make things worse, there's no ""play all"" option for the deleted scenes. Again, a simple, standard option that makes life easier.Most of the new deleted scenes themselves aren't particularly exciting and it's clear why they were cut. Amongst the prequels, the only one I enjoyed was the ROTS Elevator Antics because it really shows the bond between Obi-Wan and Anakin. I also liked the Anakin-Palpatine relationship in Amending the Constitution. The really gems are the original trilogy deleted scenes. It was truly magical seeing scenes we've heard about for three decades but never seen. . I personally think the Anchorhead scene should have stayed in the movie because it's great characterization for Luke. It's even great seeing rough cuts of the Cantina. The ESB scenes weren't quite as dramatic, although I did like seeing the extra footage of the pre-1997 Wampas. But it's clear those scenes would have detracted from the film. ROTJ also has some neat scenes, such as the one of Luke building the lightsaber - another one that could easily have made it to the final cut. The expanded scenes with Moff Jerjerrod really build up his character and make him a much more sympathetic. I really do wish they'd kept that in.I want to be clear: these movies look gorgeous on blu-ray. However, they didn't look bad on DVD. The main selling feature of this blu-ray was the bonus features and I just think they could have - and should have - had an easier layout. Hopefully future releases will streamline the menu options. I hate to give Star Wars just 3 stars, but I really think this release could have and should have been better.",Star Wars: The Complete Saga - Episodes I-VI

1380557,"This is one of the finest films I've had the privilege to watch. Chronicling the well-known story of Aron Ralston, a climber and canyoneer who was forced to sever his arm to survive being trapped in a canyon after five days, the story runs the gamut from the highs of his adventure prior to the mishap to the lows where he has accepted death and is recording goodbyes to his family on his video camera, asking anyone who finds it to keep the camera but deliver the tape to his family. There are too few films about what it means to be a man, persevering when things are at their worst, doing whatever must be done to solve a problem, fighting to overcome odds, dealing with one's own mistakes, and making the hardest decisions and following through on them. From the hallucinations the dehydrated Ralston was experiencing to the sheer joy at finally breaking the bones in his arm so that he might amputate it with his dull knife, the emotional journey of the movie is remarkable. I cried as the film neared its end, and I can fully understand the reports of people passing out in the film festivals when he finally managed to break his arm and sever it, despite the near-certainty that he still would not survive. In the special features is an extended and alternate ending, which caused me to cry again while watching it, as it shows different scenes such as when he woke in the hospital to see his mother again, whom he had thought never to see again. Please, buy this movie and experience what manhood is all about. It's not about the ideals women would assign as seen in romantic comedies and dramas, its about what you find inside yourself at the end of your rope.Truly, this movie should have rated better in the Best Picture and Best Actor categories at the Oscars, as Franco's performance is exceptionally good and the film's tale of a boy becoming a man and learning from his mistakes (at great cost, no doubt), is something everyone should see.",127 Hours

Every time I saw the previews, I kept thinking, ""This is going to be the same plot I've seen on the other versions."" Even when I read the summary of the film, I kept thinking, ""This is the same film just with a young, black actor."" However, my mother kept gushing over the film and telling me how good it was, even though she knows I don't get into action films that don't have race cars. Finally I gave in and watched it. Was I right about it being predictable? Absolutely. Did I know the end at the very beginning? From the bottom to the top. However, what I didn't know was how much swagger Jaden Smith has. I remember him being cute in ""Pursuit of Happyness,"" but I wasn't prepared for his dance skills, his very convincing flirtatious nature with his ""like"" interest Wenwen Han (who plays Meiying), the look on his face when he was fighting Zhenwei Wang (who plays Cheng) or his comedic timing. If not for Jaden Smith having those extras, this would've been one boring film. Cheng and his crew had a butt whooping due to them long ago, but the teacher was so out of hand I could understand why they were so aggressive. And by the way, Zhenwei Wang did an EXCELLENT job of being the villain. He was way too good at that role. I wonder if he's nice in real life because the look in his eyes made me wonder was he more serious than acting, which is a great thing for any actress. Great film.

178300,"After seeing a 96 minute version of his latest film in 1958, an understandably outraged Orson Welles rushed home and cranked out a 58-page memo to Universal Studios outlining all of the changes that would improve the film. Predictably, the studio ignored him and the memo was lost. A few years ago, film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum uncovered this memo and together with editor Walter Murch, producer Rick Schmidlin, and one of the film's stars, Janet Leigh, they re-assembled the film as Welles originally intended it to be seen. Aside from the credit-less opening (also minus Henry Mancini's be-bop score), this current version isn't really anything new if you've bought it on video in the last ten years. Still, nothing beats watching Welles' atmospheric ode to police corruption on the big screen in all of its newly remastered and restored glory. Sure, the story is still pure pulp fiction hokum, but Welles and his cast seem to be having so much fun chewing up the scenery that it translates into real down and dirty fun.It also doesn't hurt that this new print is crisp and clear so that Russell Metty's stunning Expressionistic black and white cinematography looks as striking as it must have upon its original debut.

1109986,"Two great things happened for me this past year.First, I discovered the books Seasoned Romance, Dr. Ruth's Sex at 50, and Grandpa Does Grandma, each of which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex and romance. One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including  Erin O'Brien's Strong Body, Ageless Body. Seniors can go from beginning to more advanced strength training. And I believe you will see great results in so many areas of your life, including better self image and ultimately greater sex!More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.Thanks, Erin O'Brien, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!","Strong Body, Ageless Body with Erin O'Brien"

I haven't contacted Amazon yet about exchange but two other movies that are 'instant copies' play fine as does most of this one.As for the movie, it is historically inaccurate as far as timeline goes. The Pershing was not deployed in Europe until Feb/March 1945. It would have saved a lot of tankers lives if it had been available in the fall of 1944. They keep referring to the German Panther tank as having an '88'. The Panther had a high velocity 75mm main gun which was quite capable of defeating the Sherman's armor at most combat ranges.The plusses for the movie are that they made it when real Sherman tanks were available! All the Sherman's in the main scenes are 75mm gun models and are probably M4A3s with the Ford GAA engine. The background images in the title sequence show M4A3E8s with 76mm guns which didn't show up until mid to late 1944.Since there weren't any running German tanks available, WWII U.S. Tank Destroyers were used as stand-ins.All in all, an entertaining movie and a boon to fans of the Sherman tank.",The Tanks Are Coming VHS

689285,"It has a cooler yet very pathetic story that was not well put together and this film lacks the funny scenes that the original had and instead they use really stupid actions from very dumbfounded characters! The special effects and the way people die are just so stupid and farfetched! But the film did have a few things going for it such as a returning character (Jennifer Ritchkoff), some gorier scenes that have part one shedding a tear, and a better killer clown mask... but most of it was worn down by its bad dialogue!Plot: After the grisly events from part one of the Camp Blood Trilogy a film director approaches the survivor of the whole ordeal and wants her to be executive producer and to let the actors know how she felt when the killings started and ended (Which she does a terrible job doing because she doesn't ever do anything except recall flashbacks)! She sees it as a way to leave the asylum that she was admitted to and accepts the offer. Now with his so called $130 million budget he meets the cast with his two man crew (one who is an alcoholic and the other is a pot head) and they begin to make the movie. But the killings never ended instead they grew! Now the team soon realizes that they are being chased and slaughtered by a killer that isn't clowning around! Can Tricia (Jennifer Ritchkoff) save what is left of the team or even try to stop this new killer that wants only revenge!Review: Phew that plot stinks and it reeks of bad story build up and just dreaded story in general! Now that I have got that out of my system I must say that this did feel more like a slasher flick than the fist mainly due to the bloodier and a more frequent towards the end kind of body count! The first two victims don't even make sense though, because they are never explored or even mentioned in the rest of the movie and even one of the deaths they person dies from having his hand chopped off... I know that if no medical attention was acquired for this poor soul then he would eventually die but this person dies in like 10-15 seconds and the individual barley even screams!!! I do like though how they did more with this movie and how the killer ""gets rid of the competition"" to be apart of this massacre or should I say cause this massacre. They really knew what they wanted to do with this sequel especially considering it was made in a little less than half a year! This movie is especially a good watch because it has a helluvalot of entertainment and cheap thrills that give us a lot of bloody bodies to help boost the interest of the viewer even if the deaths are incredibly unrealistic!Acting: This is ridiculous... the first one tried acting all serious but failed and this time it tries to be stupid-funny and fails yet again! The worst set up I believe that the one of the characters endured was when the ""Director"" (whom was played by Garret Clancy) was all attracted and in love with the girl (mostly because of her breasts) that got the part to play Jennifer Ritchkoff role and then the next day when she didn't show he acted like he never even heard of the actresses name! It had ridiculous acting and overall dreaded dialogue.... especially when the people portraying the original victims for the movie acted that's when I thought I couldn't take anymore!Gore: an off-screen slit throat is what starts up the movie and then the machete through the stomach to kick off the last death until the 40-50 minute mark! After that we get the dreaded hand chopped off with a machete scene, a guy is sliced and diced like crazy with a machete, a woman gets a machete impaled through her face and out her head (because... where else would it go... I'm kidding and using very bad sarcasm to go along with it, were was I, oh yeah) that death actually looked good and I was quite surprised, we also get a machete sliced into ones head (with smoke, yes I said it smoke coming out of his head... along with a lot of blood, he must've been very aggravated because that was the scene when everyone left the set and the director was getting very angry and then *Spoiler Alert* gets his steaming demise *End Spoiler*), a cool looking throat slashing, a piece of shard glass from a bottle is shoved into a mans eyes, a burnt face, a machete sliced into a victims neck and more... there is a very hilarious scene where the alcoholic (Shemp, I wonder where they got that name from *Hint* Evil Dead *End Hint*) punches a girl because he was confused and drunk and she was screaming and I guess it just pissed him off to much!Bottom Line: Director Brad Sykes is very talented in doing what he does and with what he has. There was another dislike I had about this movie and it was that pretty much all the character names from part one were used in part two for totally different characters.... one other thing I liked how ever was the whole revenge theme that unfolds at the end.. .it was very well played out and that's what made it feel more like a true and serious slasher flick!Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for strong violence and gore, some sexuality/nudity, and languageIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 1For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 2",Camp Blood 2

It didn't scare me nearly as much as the first one, but I really liked the way they tied the two movies together.  Not really sure they need a 3rd one, but they are making one anyway.  I guess horror directors and studios just dont know when to stop.  I give it a B-.Would I watch it again? - I think I would, after re-watching the first one to see stuff I may have missed",N/A
1383377,"Strapped is an interesting indie film about a good-looking hustler who has many memorable experiences on one fateful night. Here is a gay film that is sexy, well-acted, and eventually romantic. There are some scenes that move too slowly, and times when I didn't know where the movie was going. And although the film's third act is romantic, it's also somewhat sappy for a movie that started off dark and edgy.. Still, Strapped is worth seeing if you like challenging independent movies.",N/A

What is special is that the movie is in a case that opens and reads like a hardback book.  I have had NO trouble with pages falling out, but I do not try to pry the book all the way open. It is easily opened and easily read  with beautiful, glossy pages of each of the grisly scenes, actor pages, etc.  I just could not be happier with this, and got it at a wonderful price on a Gold Box Deal Day !Oh.. and I also read some people had trouble with packaging.

The symboles and images range from the city, the desert, the bigotry and violence inherent within remote towns, the indigenous culture, and the kinds of characters they meet along the way (such as Bob (Bill Hunter) and his mad Philipino wife).When one of the tranny trio announce that he wants to climb Ayres Rock, the Terrance Stamp rejoinder is priceless:'A cock in a frock on a rock! Just what this country needs!' (As if what Australia needed was of any interest to Terrance Stamp!)The movie is a great look at Australian gay culture, with lots of colour and humour. It is also a good story about how, as the characters journey from Sydney to Alice springs (two places of great symbolic significance to Australians), they meet personal and practical challenges, and come to terms with them.",N/A

I found the imperfections to make the experience more genuine; too perfect restorations sometimes feel artificial. After I got involved in the story, I had to remember to look for the flaws to even notice them anymore.The story was great (in the extras you learn it was based on a true story)and the sound was great.

1274094,"It's hard to categorize a film like Adoration. Basically it takes the topic of terrorism and wraps it around an interesting story about a teenage boy who wants to learn more about how his parents died. Without spoiling *too* much, the boy constantly questions what happened to his parents through interviews with his bedridden grandfather and an online debate team with his classmates.However there's an interesting aspect to the storytelling, and the subjects of religion and terrorism are a recurring theme. It's nothing particularly complex or deep however, even though the writers tried making it appear that way. It's nothing more than a really well thought out storyline from where I stand, and makes us reflect on the 9/11 incident obviously.Some of the twists pertaining to the storyline are fairly shocking, but only slightly. They roll along occasionally. In the end you just knew the scattered pieces to the puzzle would eventually fit, so to speak. I mean, you can't have a storyline *this* disjointed without a few revelations.Truth be told, a film like this probably needs at least two viewings to fully appreciate, though you should be able to understand most of the events right away. The subtle aspect to the storytelling probably won't be revealed right away, though.The subject of religion is honestly secondary to the other topics focusing around the actual storyline, such as the drama teacher who ends up playing the role of a *very* surprising twist at the end.The acting is pretty good, though nothing extraordinary like many reviewers believe.  It's good enough to get the job done and nothing more.One scene involving a taxi driver and a short argument in a restaurant is absolutely hilarious!I'm underrating just how *good* and captivating the storyline is though.

Then later in the show Luger said no he had commitments to meet. Luger was set to fight a jobber until Pillman came to the ring & a brawl broke out the following week Luger came down to the ring while Plillman was wrestling & was once again bested by Flyin Brian.

307779,"Republic Pictures presents ""THE QUIET MAN"" (1952) - (125 min/Color) -- Starring: John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Barry Fitzgerald, Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen & Mildred NatwickDirected by John FordIrish-American boxer John Wayne, recovering from the trauma of having accidentally killed a man in the ring, arrives in the Irish village where he was born. Hoping to bury his past and settle down to a life of tranquility, Wayne has purchased the home of his birth from wealthy local widow Mildred Natwick, a transaction that has incurred the wrath of pugnacious squire Victor McLaglen, who coveted the property for himself. By and by, Wayne falls in love with McLaglen's beautiful, high-spirited sister Maureen O'Hara. Her insistence that Wayne conduct his courtship in a proper Irish manner-with puckish matchmaker Barry Fitzgerald along for the ride as ""chaperon""--is but one obstacle to their future happiness: the other is McLaglen, who spitefully refuses to give his consent to his sister's marriage, or to honor the tradition of paying a dowry to Wayne. Wayne could care less about dowries, but the tradition-bound Maureen refuses to consummate her marriage until McLaglen pays up.The Perfect Movie Experience, there has never been another like it.Special footnote: -- Barry Fitzgerald is the brother of actor Arthur Shields, with whom he performed in several films, most notably John Ford's The Quiet Man (1952).Oscar Winner for Best Director & Best Color CinematographyOscar Nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Victor McLaglen), Screenplay, Sound Recording & Art Direction.BIOS:1.

897162,"After the impressive success of Bocaccio 70 and Rogopag, the idea of making another set of vigentes seemed to have fashioned in the mind of the great Italian filmmakers. Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavatini worked as a team to make one of the most full rounded artistic masterworks of the Italian Cinema in years. Of course you may feel in De Sica a visible Fellinian enchantment with this funny portrait of a minor smuggler of imported cigarettes, who is absolutely convinced she can escape from the legal arm assuming her motherhood over and over. Of course the no sense situations  derived since this surrealistic script is developed until its last consequences by De Sica. De Sica as Bu&ntilde;uel, auscultated the Italian society making a visceral dissection on the social mentality with his accurate scalpel, employing his undeniable mastery to carve in relief in Naples a quotidian tragedy masking it of laughable episodes.In the second episode, Cesare Zavatini explores the existential boredom of the wife of a wealthy industrial magnate. Nothing new under the sun since Antonioni with his previous films such as The Adventure, The eclipse and Fellini with La Dolce Vita had reflected with major extension this crucial dilemma.But let's be honest: The third chapter of this entry was the funniest of all. A sexy woman who works by dates with high managements manipulates the febrile anxiety state of a Bolognese executive when she (without proposing herself makes a very young aspirant to priest loses his head for her). Mastroianni is extremely funny in his role of desperate and tantalized man and the brief strip tease of Madame Loren will remain for the posterity in one of the most sexiest sequences the cinema reminds.A winner film under any point of view.",N/A

1247934,"I watched Iron Man 1 two nights ago and Iron Man 2 last night with my two teenage boys. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 but didn't find Iron Man 2 as good. I did like the special effects though and found Robert Downey Jr. even better.In Iron Man 1, Downey plays Tony Stark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an ""Iron Man suit"", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool. Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 because of the great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars.In Iron Man 2, Stark has now disclosed to the public that he is Iron Man and the fame has gone a bit to his head. The government wants his 'weapon', his board loses confidence in him, his friends become increasingly annoyed with his behaviour, and the magnet in his chest is poisoning him to death. Paltrow is back as his assistant, Pepper, but I don't like her character as much in this one; too harsh. and Downey of course is back as Tony Stark. But in this movie, Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as his military friend. I like Cheadle but much preferred Howard. Samuel Jackson is great as usual as is Mickey Rourke who plays the villain, but Scarlett Johanssen's character was boring and very unrealistic (yes, even for a super-hero movie).I did enjoy the background about Stark's family and father, especially when he discovers a message left to him by his father which can save his life. And Robert Downey's character is even more enjoyable in this one ie wittier, more sarcastic, more foibles.So, my conclusion is that it is still worth watching though not as good as the first.

I guess the writer and director wanted to keep Kowalkski an ""every man"" type of guy who could be any American who feels the need to lose their past. You could also view this movie as an existential absurdity; a man who just wants to run away from life forever is chased by cops for no real reason at all other than the simple fact that he's running.

120647,"I first heard about Get Carter when watching an episode of Bad Movie Beatdown give a scathing analysis of the 2000 remake of Get Carter starring Sylvester Stallone, and Mathew Buck (the host of BMB) used the original Get Carter to help prove his points on how awful the remake was.  I was enticed by the original when watching his review and I've been hesitant to get the DVD since they were expensive (due to being discontinued).  However, it's available on Amazon's Video on Demand and since I have a large computer monitor with full HD (my Alienware Aurora desktop is like a mini home theater system), I bought it to watch on my computer, and boy am I glad to have seen this one!!STORYGet Carter is about a London gangster named Jack Carter (Michael Caine) who finds out that his brother Frank died in a car accident due to drunk driving, but Jack thinks that it was caused by something else and travels north interrogating who he believes is responsible for his brother's death and dish out revenge.  However, on his path of revenge, Jack uncovers secrets about Frank that complicate his situation with the gangs he's confronting.CHARACTERSGet Carter is similar to the Martin Scorcese masterpiece Taxi Driver (1976) where practically the entire movie revolves around the central character, and in this case, it's Jack Carter.  This can have its ups and downs because only the central character is well developed, but I'll let this pass because as stated before, the movie is really all about Carter and it feels pretty realistic as Carter is mostly on the move to get what he wants, so it feels pretty understandable that we can't really sit down and get to know the rest of the characters, so to speak.  To also cover this, the supporting cast don't feel like cliches but rather like real people and don't act in contrived manners just to convenience the plot.  Of course, it's Jack Carter that makes the show, and it's certainly a showcase for the justified acclaim surrounding Michael Caine.  Carter feels and acts like a real gangster because while he does have some compassion for certain people, he's largely a cold-blooded maniac who only cares about his own goals and could care less about others he bumps into and will get rid of people that stand in his way.  To give an example, when Carter gets close to nabbing the men who killed his brother, he gets rid of Frank's former frequent prostitute named Margaret, who snitched to his rivals about Jack's whereabouts earlier, he forcefully gives her a fatal injection of heroin and dumps her body near a body of water by the mansion of rival gangster Cyril Kinnear, then calls the cops on him the morning after a booze and sex-fueled party and they all get arrested (with the cops believing Margaret died because of Kinnear).  Also, I love that Carter isn't perfect with his planning as he just dives into confrontations without weighing out the pros and cons, which has a very dire consequence at the end of the movie.  In short, Caine's performance is riveting and his portrayal of a British gangster is top notch, with supporting cast feeling very believable.PLOTTINGThe plotting for Get Carter is quite excellent because while you immediately know in the beginning that Jack's brother was killed in a car accident, and that you see Jack plot out revenge, his acts of revenge aren't immediate.  Jack casually sniffs out who he thinks is responsible and when Carter's boss is telling him to movie back to London by sending his goons to intimidate him, he begins to see that things aren't as simple as he initially thought.  This gets further entangled when at around 3/4ths of the movie, Jack finds out that his niece was forced into a pornographic film by Kinnear and this new burden destroys Jack even more inside.  Also, going back to the ""dire consequence"" stated earlier, the ending for this feels very appropriate and especially in American cinema where there's almost always a happy ending, the end to this movie is a nice change of pace from the contrived norm.SETTINGWriter and director Mike Hodges did a great job with choosing the setting.  To capture the grit revolving around the story, he had the movie filmed in Tyneside, which is rampant with industrial complexes, smoke-filled bars, strip clubs, and dilapidated apartments.  This was a wise choice because that particular setting really gives off a low-class quality that's inseparable to the gangster feeling.  To further enhance the feeling of grittiness, there's no flashy editing techniques anywhere in the movie (the only one that's close is the first person view of the train during the opening credits, but I wouldn't even call it flashy), giving it a very realistic feel that's enhanced with the low quality camera used to film the movie (this is evident by the amount of grain in the picture).  THIS is how to make a crime thriller, none of this flashy, polished BS like Smokin' Aces (one of the worst movies I've ever seen).SOUNDTRACKThe soundtrack for Get Carter is quite fitting because with the use of contemporary music at the time (funk-fueled jazz), it further enhances the feeling that you're in a slimy city in England in the early 70's.  The funky jazz fits very well with the atmosphere, and for the movie's darker moments, there's some dark synthesizers utilized for the scenes and capture the mood really well.VIDEO ON DEMANDIf you can find it for a decent price, I suggest you get the DVD copy of Get Carter because with the video I purchased with Video on Demand, I noticed that there were several moments where the picture quality would get a little artifacted (such as with the opening credits).  I'm disappointed by this because video with some artifacting is expectable of YouTube, but not when you're purchasing a video file from Amazon, which is a universally lauded website.FINAL WORDIf you love gritty and down-to-earth early 70's crime thrillers, then Get Carter is essential.  Skip the flashy remake, it has none of the spirit the original has.",N/A

The storyline change is a little ridiculous at this time since the idea of post war nazi fascist trying to make the US and Russia go to war is a bit cliche as some have pointed out. It really should have stayed with the more believable Middle East connection in the book. Still worth at least a rental.

It shows us how hard a wrestler's life is when they are past thier prime,lose thier family,thier body badly beaten up and just trying to make ends meet. It's also one of the the saddest movies in years. I wish The Nostalgia Critic would have added this film to his Top 11 Saddest Moments Countdown. The rest of the cast are also good actors.

She has been in several soft-core porn movies and is only a half-baked actress to boot.

Red is voiced by a different actress.I wondered how well this movie did in the theaters compared to the first, and the Internet Movie Database showed that the first movie opened to 16 Million USD while this movie opened with only $4 Million USD the first week in the theater. Hoodwinked Too had terrible earnings compared to the first which is a reflection of how movie goers felt about the film.This movie didn't have the charm or surprises of the first. There were new elements, but no new magic (which is hard to achieve in a sequel, but it can be done...the Toy Story sequels for example).The references to Star Wars sure seemed out of the Blue.

1421021,"WRESTLEMANIA XXVIIApril 3, 2011Georgia DomeAtlanta, GeorgiaBefore I get into my review of the matches, I want to tell everyone why I think this WrestleMania was a disappointment from where I sit. Its booking was Russo like. I expected WWE is pull out all the stops since this wasnt the strongest Mania card in a while. But they somehow didnt move forward in the booking. I will explain in more detail in my match reviews.World Heavyweight Championship:Edge (Champion) V. Alberto Del RioWhy is this the opening match for the THIRD STRAIGHT PPV??!! They didnt have any other match they felt could have given the crown life except this match?? Why not put Orton/Punk here & have this match where Orton/Punk was? The World Heavyweight Championship Match should NEVER open a WrestleMania. Plus the Royal Rumble winner was in it, so at least put him a little higher on the card!! It makes it look like you have doubts for him to draw in the future. As far as the match goes...Better than what I thought it was going to be. It did get the crowd into so it did its job there. A couple of botches but thats ok. Edge retains. ***1/2Cody Rhodes V. Rey MysterioI was expecting A LOT more from these two. The match was slow & didnt pick up the pace like a Mysterio match normally does. Rhodes didnt perform like I thought he would have. He was in there with Mysterio!! He can like a pig look good in the ring! Rhodes gets the win. **Big Show, Kane, Kofi Kingston, & Santino MarellaV.Wade Barrett, Ezekiel Jackson, Justin Gabriel, & Health SlaterHave you even seen an 8-Man Tag match without ANY tags? This was the first. The match was changed the day before the event to have a better match by taking Vladimir Kozlov out and putting Kofi in. So lets give them...2 MINUTES!! Yes, this match was 2 minutes long. Big Shows team wins. That doesnt even make seem right. Why would the faces win?? The pretty much beat the crap out of the core for the final 2 weeks of build-up & 3 out of the 4 core members have championships!! Way to protect your champions!! This match was a DUD!!!CM Punk V. Randy OrtonOne of the few bright spots on the card. How good of a heel is CM Punk??...Just amazing is the answer!! Great ring psychology with the work on Orton's knee. Orton selling the knee injury to perfection. A predictable set up spot for the RKO at the end but its all good. Orton wins. ***1/2Jerry Lawler V. Michael ColeIf you were thinking that this match was going to be good going into the event...you are dumber than Paris Hilton. For months Cole has been pretty nasty to Lawler & even cost him the WWE Championship. So simple logical calls for Lawler to get revenge & win the match. Cant really screw up the booking on this one right?? So lets see how they managed to screw it up. The match went too long for what it was. You give this match 10-15 minutes and an 8-Man Tag 2 minutes!! Cole was in control for WAY too long. Lawler finally gets the upper hand & wins the match. He celebrates with Stone Cold for like 5 minutes (really...do you need to give them more time??) Then the Raw GM says that Cole wins by DQ because Austin did something. Umm...what?? (no pun intended) So Lawler doesnt get the win in his most likely only WrestleMania match. How is this closure on a SIX MONTH long feud? You have feuds that long to match go to Mania for the good guy to prevail in the end. Horrible...oh...DUDNo Holds Barred Match:The Undertaker V. Triple HThis was the match that everyone was talking about going into Wrestlemania. So everyone was thinking this match was going to be the best on the card. It was the best match on the card. But it also was the most disappointing match on the card. This match was hyped too much for me. I was thinking that this match had to be something special. They start brawling on the outside for like 5 minutes, then they start hitting their finishers?? This match had way too much OVERSELLING. After every move..im serious...EVERY MOVE...they would sell for like 2 or 3 minutes. Triple H dominated most of the match. He hits 3 Pedigrees & taker kicks out. Hits him with tons of chair shots & taker kicks out. Hits him with Takers own Tombstone & taker kicks out. Then somehow taker locks in Hells Gate. Triple H tries to fight out of it. He even had takers shoulders to the mat for like 3 minutes & the ref didnt even go for the pin once. Triple H passes out, wakes up just in time to tap & passes out again. Then Taker oversells for like an extra 10 minutes! Taker, the man who won the match is selling stuff that happened to him like 10 minutes earier while Triple H wokes up for his coma again about 2 minutes after the match. They could have booked this match A LOT BETTER. I understand that Taker was selling so that the fan can see that Triple H was the better man but didnt win. The problem is that nothing really happened in this match that Taker didnt already go though in any other match. So overselling doesnt work here. ***3/4 match but not what I was looking for.John Morrison, Trish Stratus, & SnookieV.Dolph Ziggler & LayCoolWasnt expecting a long or good match here & that is what I got. Snookie does a pretty impressive handspring elbow & Morrison hits Starship Pain on Ziggler who was on the floor & thats about its. Morrison, Stratus, & Snookie win. *1/2WWE Championship:The Miz (Champion) V. John CenaI wasnt expecting too much from this match. It was better than I thought but not enough for me to says ""oh my god"". It was decent. The only real problem I have with it is the ending. Miz & Cena get double counted out. The match is a draw. The Rock comes down & restarts the match with no dq & no countout because he is the host and he can do that. Rock hits Cena with Rock Bottom, the Miz covers, & retains. **1/2 Then the Rock beats up the Miz. My problem is that why did they have the book the double countout? Why not just have the Rock come down & hit Cena with the Rock Bottom? Plus, the Miz just retains the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Cant he celebrate it? Why book it so the Rock beats him up? Again, its a protect your champion thing.Overall the booking is in serious question. Plus the Rock opens the show and cuts a promo for 15 minutes & you dump The United States Championship off the card so the Rock can talk?? He pretty much said the same thing he has been saying for the last month. I was very disappointed in this years WrestleMania. Hopefully they learn from their mistakes this year & WrestleMania XXVII in Miami will be a lot better!!",WWE: WrestleMania XXVII
198978,"Scarface is simply one of the best, if not the best, American gangster films of the '30s (1932), brilliantly directed by Howard Hawks, and grounded on a superb performance by Paul Muni, in which Muni, as Tony Camonte muscles and shoots his way (temporarily) to the top of his profession selling prohibition liquor.  Hawks's direction is crisp, his scenes are lean and sharp and move the story along on its own terms and the force of its characters. Many of the scenes are cinematically memorable, full of oddities, quirks and even a good dose of humor: George Raft, a somewhat sensitive killer,  passing time by cutting out a chain of paper dolls; Boris Karloff gunned down in a bowling alley as we watch the last pin of his last ""strike"" totter and fall; the St. Valentine's Day Massacre (or something much like it) shown only in shadow; Muni's secretary (really just one of the boys, and not the brightest one at that) hampered in his duties because he can't write, can never seem to get the name of a telephone caller (until the last call he takes after he has been shot but just before he dies of his wounds) and who, in two brilliant moments (i) becomes so infuriated with the phone itself that he pulls his gun to shoot the offending mechanism and (ii) while handling yet another call in a restaurant being machine-gunned to pieces, cares only about the safety of his hat and can't seem to figure out that he is being doused because of a bullet hole in a vat of beer.  In addition to quality players like Raft and Karloff, Hawks makes brilliant use of his actresses, Ann Dvorak as Muni's sister and Karen Morley as Muni's boss's girl, whom Muni sets out to acquire with the rest of his boss's operation.  Both of the female leads exude sexuality in a way that (combined with the violence) could not have pleased the nascent Hays Office, established in 1930 but not really in the saddle until 1934.The real force of the picture, however, lies in Muni's performance.  It seems curious that Muni was recognized as one of the leading actors of his generation and nominated for a best actor Oscar 5 times while appearing in only 25 or so films.  Although certainly not forgotten by film buffs and historians, his name doesn't seem to come up in many discussions of great actors of the '30s through the '50s.  Perhaps it is the incredible diversity of roles he played. His ""Tony"" is hardly recognizable as the same lead actor in The Life of Emile Zola, The Story of Louis Pasteur, or The Good Earth. (About this last role, Muni is reputed to have said that he was about as Chinese as Herbert Hoover.)  In any case, Muni is at his brilliant, scene stealing best here, using every trick imaginable to command the camera and create a character that at once a ruthless gangster with a slightly unhealthy thing about his own sister, who is also a bit sympathetic, charming and even funny. In one of my favorite moments, Muni is trying to impress ""Poppy,"" the girl he wants, with his ""swell"" new pad.  Asked if she likes it, Poppy says, obviously critically, ""It's a little gauche, don't you think?"" to which Muni replies enthusiastically, ""So you really like it?"" Maybe not an exact quote, but close enough.The movie is also interesting for the way it tried to sidestep the impending Hays Code (disingenuously, I have to believe) by its opening message: ""This is the world as it is!  The government is YOUR government. What is it going to do about it? What are you going to do about it?""  Again, not an exact quote, but you get the idea.All in all, a movie that really deserves to be seen not just by film buffs, and a reminder of what a remarkable actor Paul Muni really was.",Scarface VHS
258856,"Though I'm not particularly religious myself, I've always been fascinated with the subject - whether one is among the faithful, ambivalent, or a hard-core atheist, one should I think acknowledge how important religion has been to all the world's cultures throughout history.  If you care about the present, I think you need to know a bit about the past - more than a bit - and that certainly includes knowing something about Christianity - and perhaps even knowing something about our culture's popular religious stories and entertainments, as well as the more serious studies.  So though I don't spend as much time on the subject as I'd like to, I make an effort to watch at least one religious epic every year that's new to me (and usually one or more that I'd already seen).  The late 40s through the early 60s saw a whole lot of them in America, and as they're mostly pretty long and often cover the same ground, it's a many-years-project.  This year:  THE ROBE.I guess overall I was a bit disappointed with this one; I didn't expect brilliance exactly but I suppose I thought it was going to be a bit more entertaining or edifying than it actually was. Being the first Cinemascope feature I supect probably accounts in some part for the conservatism (and I'm not talking politics here) of the filmmaking - it's just not an excitingly-shot film in any way, and it doesn't help that it's nearly all done on sets, and not particularly real-looking or beautiful sets either. Sure, it's a cut above the cheapie historical stuff from the period (i.e things like SLAVES OF BABYLON, a William Castle film from the same year) but it's nowhere near the sumptuousness of many of the major historical epics from later on in the decade.  Director Henry Koster's idea of shooting for the widescreen seems mostly to consist of having lots of people or things filling up the 2.35 frame, rather than moving the camera or having multiple actions happening in the shot. Tedious, generally.If the sets and camerawork are dull, at least the color photography of Leon Shamroy is fine - not perhaps as brilliant as the best, but pretty enough though this transfer doesn't seem perfect - and the cast didn't let me down, even if Jean Simmons is rather wasted in the torn-between-the emperor-and-lover role. Richard Burton is pretty darn good, and Victor Mature is his usual much-better-than-he's-given-credit-for self; my favorite scene in the film is probably the one early on where Jesus rides by (unseen except for profile, hand and leg shots - reminiscent of the way he's treated in BEN-HUR which, like this film, is based on a then-popular novel about the ""side stories"" around the messiah) and Mature's slave character Demetrius is instantly taken with him and decides to follow him. Being someone who doesn't believe in this stuff I can't say I find this, or Burton's later conversion, ""convincing"" but it is fairly effectively done and carries more emotional charge than the bulk of the film. I also quite liked Michael Rennie as Simon Peter, and Jay Robinson is memorable I suppose as Caligula though it's a fairly typical and not so subtly gay/mincing stereotype. And Ernest Thesiger is GREAT in his one little scene as Tiberius.So all in all this is, I would say, worth seeing if somewhat flat.  The Palestine-set scenes are generally more effective than the Roman ones, and I think the film might have been more effective overall if there'd been less concentration on Rome overall.  Thankfully it's shorter than a lot of the other ""epics"" of the period, at 3 hours this would be tough to get throUgh I think.  My personal favorite of this genre from the period is probably the 1959 BEN-HUR; later TV miniseries like JESUS OF NAZARETH and MASADA are also I think more impressive both as spectacle and in a spiritual sense, though nothing will top Martin Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST for me as a film that made me really think about this period, this man, and what he (or He) means in human history.DVD NOTES:  I have the older, original DVD release from a decade ago which looks OK though a bit soft; but as Wade H. Rice Jr. in his excellent review here notes, even the newer Blu-Ray has some color issues; it seems a full restoration of this film is probably needed.  In any case, the DVD is certainly watchable enough, and as I said, even the best color reproduction is probably not going to keep one from noticing the so-so production design and sets.",N/A

It's sometimes easy to forget how much our culture has changed in the past few years, but the issues grappled with in the show over, primarily, religion are in a time capsule as we seem to have collectively moved on from many of those issues (not that they have gone away, but the religious right is no longer the massive force it was when this show was on).",Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series
1217307,"The Magic Flute is an enchanting, crashing, bore, to me.  I am not interested in Masonry.  I am not interested in a labored exposition of Virtue from the Enlightenment.  I adore serpents with feathers, boys in balloons, rustics with singing birds, brave young men with pretty girls, and ghastly hags.I adore all of Mozart's music, but this music is Mozart drunk on Champagne, Chanel No. 5, and rainbows.I have not seen this DVD, though I have ordered it.  It is the DVD of a live performance at the Met last Christmas, which I did see.  I am a fairly blue-nosed opera lover, usually frosty about cut versions, childrens' versions, versions in English, and so on, every one of which this is.  For my opening reasons, I find this particular production genius.It goes for enchantment, it goes for sheer love of the music (James Levine, the greatest living operatic conductor, and the Metropolitan orchestra!), it goes for wit and high spirits.  It is designed for the happiness (and attention span) of quite young children, but not at all for the virtuous boredom of their elders.It was meant for Christmas.

1125855,"This is an old-school film. It is rich in details, elegance, and subtleties. This film certainly would rank as one of the best Asian films of all time.The pace is slow and deliberate. Each sequence is shot beautifully and carefully.  There is no deliberate attempt to shoot a fast paced film to reduce the duration of the film and to engage an audience with short attention span. The plot was cleverly written to make the audience pay attention to the subtle details. Did the main character notice the cover? Maybe, but maybe not. The audience is left guessing to the end and each sequence provides a clue of what each character is thinking and the deep and complex psychology involved.The nude sequences, in my opinion, weren't warranted. But they did not detract from the film either. This would have been a fine film without the sequences which made this film NC-17.The writing and acting were superb. My guess is that the writing team had many female members who understood the subtleties of the female sexuality and psychology. When the main female character gets kissed from her long-ago love interest, she quickly pushes him away saying ""you should have done that 3 years ago...why didn't you?"". That was real.This is a gripping and engaging film that makes you think. Most of all, you are taken into the inner psyche of the characters who are genuinely conflicted between lust and caution. In that sense, the inner conflict of characters isn't much different from our own relationships.My favorite sequence? It isn't the nude scenes. It is actually the sequence when the main female character sings for her lover and foe that visibly touches him. ""Only love that lasts through the hard times is true""...""we're like a thread and needle never to be separated"" she sings...That scene moved ME to tears and it was unforgettable.

1322192,"""Hereafter"" was directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile De France, and Frankie and George McLaren. George Lonegan (Damon) is a psychic who views himself cursed with this ""gift"" of visions and the ability to talk to those in the afterlife. Marie LeLay was a respected television journalist until a brush with death in the form of a giant tidal wave inspires her to write a novel called ""Hereafter"". Frankie and George McLaren play the twins Marcus and Jason. Marcus is on a search for answers after his brother dies suddenly and he didn't get to say goodbye. Eventually all three cross paths in the most random of ways that will make you raise an eyebrow.This film tried to bill itself several different ways as if it was similar to ""The Sixth Sense"" (it isn't) or perhaps is a big budget thriller since it has that giant wave and another accident scene later (two scenes does not an action movie make). This is a quiet, slow-paced drama watching these people attempt to continue their lives though one feels cursed and his relationships always fall apart, one is being abandoned by those close to her that feel she is losing it, and the brother that feels like half of a whole. The whole film is just ok for me. I felt it easier to relate to the woman and the twin than the psychic's dilemma. Jay Mohr is a great casting choice for George Lonegan's brother who wants him to start making money off his talent again (with the brother as manager, of course). While Cecile and Marcus are both on a determined path looking for answers, I felt like George was wandering aimlessly just hoping to dissolve into the background, giving up on happiness all because as soon as someone finds out he is psychic, they demand a reading and don't like what they hear. The tidal wave was VERY impressive shaking my entire living room with the sound, but seeing it this week for the first time seemed far too much like the current events in Japan (which I hear this film title was pulled from the Japan market by request).Even if the afterlife, heaven/hell/whatever is a fascinating subject for you, the film really doesn't go very deeply into it. All the characters have very mild experiences and most of their journey takes place trying to get others in the tangible world to understand them. *Shrug* Oh and the ending made me roll my eyes so that didn't help either.Bonus Features:The movie can be played with focus points or you can watch them separately. You can learn all the different aspects that went into filming the tsunami tidal wave. Exploring the possibility of life after death just asks actors, filmmakers, and producers what their opinions are on the subject. Clint Eastwood talks about the casting of the film, who auditioned and who was given their roles on the spot, and the casting of locations, and as always the actors talk about Eastwood as a director. They interview some mediums who talk about ""head-tapping"" to profile violent criminals and make predictions. They also explore the bonds between twins from experience and also the filmmaker's knowledge of the ""white light"" experience many have when near death.""The Eastwood Factor"" is a feature-length profile of the Actor/Director's career, in his own words, covering his over 35 years with Warner Bros. Obviously this documentary was originally made for ""Invictus"" because of the introduction and Morgan Freeman narrating. There are clips from tons of his movies exploring his favorite characters and aspects of his career. It's a great introduction to Eastwood for newcomers and a good refresher course for avid fans complete with a tour of his own costume library.",N/A
1412779,"This horrible flick must have been written by a committee that couldn't agree to anything, especially the plot. There are too many. Like most modern movies, the main characters have sex in the first half hour, so the climax is over, so to speak. Great! That means there might be a new baby born that will never know its father. Great example guys! Worse yet, they end the ""love"" scene with a ""nice to meet you."" Blah! ya right.Then the multiple plots begin. First, the race is on between Jake Gyllenhaal and his competitor to sell anti depressants. Jake promotes Zoloft, saying it has 27 less side effcts than Prozac, but the point of that race is moot because Jake keeps stealing the Prozac samples from the doctor's office and tosses them in the dumpster, and we see a homeless man take them and progressively get his life back in order. Does that now mean Prozac is better than Zoloft?Second, the plot changes again, because Pfizer comes out Viagra and the whole anti depressant issue was just a waste of time, as Jake begins to party and cheat on Anne Hathaway, if they even had a relationship, considering yet another plot of Anne having Parkinson's disease, and Jake doesn't want to date somebody that is sick.All in all, who cares about this story?Next!",N/A
1145673,"I recently ordered a Retromedia title from Amazon.com called ""Scared To Death"" and was greatly disappointed.There are a number of movie companies that do not understand the purpose of widescreen. The purpose of widescreen is to show MORE of the movie as it was originally presented in it's correct aspect ratio - as opposed to fullscreen which cuts off the sides of the picture to make it fit a fullscreen TV set. Unfortunately, I've come across too many distributers, such as Retromedia, that get a print of the film, format it to fullscreen for reasons unknown, then put black bars across the top and bottom to make it LOOK LIKE widescreen. WHY? Not only are the sides cut off the film for fullscreen, but also the top and bottom are cut off for false widescreen. WHY? Movies like this one are ruined, and are preserved in their ruined state probably forever on a DVD. WHY? Plus, I have just wasted my money because you have fooled me. It's such a sad shame on many levels.I can't imagine what the faulty reasoning behind such tactics could be. It just doesn't make any logical sense.WHY?",Scared to Death

1427535,"Have you been missing the delightfully cheesy disaster films of yore? I know I have. The preposterous ""Turbulent Skies"" is a kissing cousin to the camp classic ""Airport 1975"" without the star wattage, overwrought performances, or manic intensity. Combining the estimable talents of Casper van Dien, Nicole Eggert, and Patrick Muldoon--it's not like I expected this film to compete for Oscars. I'd just hoped for a bit more fun. Everyone plays it far too straight (where's a cross-eyed Karen Black when you need her?) and the resultant film is patently dull as opposed to genuine B-movie magic. The screenplay is riddled with holes and lapses of logic, the film just needed to embrace its inherent silliness and go with it. But by asking us to take it seriously and to care, the director has missed his chance to elevate this to campy greatness. As is, only the most stalwart fans of one of the leads might be interested in this rather tedious exercise. There are plenty of more effective low budget adventures in the DVD marketplace--try to catch this on cable sometime before plopping down hard earned dollars to own it!The film centers around a new piece of technology that will revolutionize air travel. An auto-pilot device that will make humans obsolete has been developed by Eggert and team. On the test voyage, corporate greed takes over and Muldoon (the requisite bad guy) outfits a commercial airline with the device and invites investors to fly with the untested (and tampered with) unit controlling the plane. I loved how all this happened rather spontaneously--as if there wouldn't be a billion federal regulations to navigate. Soon a 747 is loaded with potential victims (By loaded, I mean 12 people. Seriously--3 corporate representatives, 4 crew members, 2 reporters, and 3 investors). All this is for THREE investors--even though no one seems to know how many people to expect. Muldoon has prepared extravagant gift bags, there are trays of champagne, and the flight attendant even attempts to shut the door before the reporters get on. No flight manifest? Can't count to twelve?Of course, the unit malfunctions and takes the plane off course. Even though there are no signs of the plane actually crashing, the military decide to shoot it down before it gets to a city. Preventive medicine, I suppose. Van Dien plays Eggert's estranged husband who might be able to save the day (and their marriage) if only he can get onto the flight. Well, he does--just in time to clip some wires. Thank goodness he was there. Eggert still has to single handedly save the day (good thing she had that rescue training on Baywatch). Again, it's all just silly--had it aspired to dumb fun, it might have worked. But I really think they wanted you to care about the thinly drawn characters and personal drama and touching moments of heroism. A low budget thriller, in which the low budget really shows and the thrills are limited, ""Turbulent Skies"" is instantly forgettable--assuming you make it to the end. Now, I really am going to re-watch ""Airport 1975"" in all its campy glory! KGHarris, 6/11.",Turbulent Skies
435625,"I've seen an advance version of this blu-ray, and it is a significant improvement over the DVD copy. The picture quality is quite grainy in some scenes, but this is due to source-based age and replicates this 25 year old catalog title nicely in high-def. Color saturation and contrast are about where they should be, with only minor black level crush and no noticeable print damage can be seen. A great 5.1 DTS-MA rounds out this release and while extras are sparse, fans of the film should definately pick this up. As for the film itself, it's at best just a standard B-grade Stallone cop action vehicle, but is worth at least a rental if you like macho 80's action films.",Cobra

I am writing my concerns to ABC Family Channel, Paul Lee, President, 3800 West Alameda Ave., Burbank, CA  91505. (NO RESPONSE - they care about their customers???)Vol. 1 has captions in English, French, and Spanish, Vol. 2 has NONE, and I wasted my money on it.

1273296,"This has to be best season in Smallville's history. The main protagonists in Season 9 are Major Zod and his army of Kandorians We finally see Zod, even though its a younger version of him (Major Zod, a clone, who's DNA was taken years before he became the evil conquerer General Zod, who destroyed Krypton). He's basically a replacement for the Smallville version Lex Luthor, who like 'Major', we see before he became the archnemesis of Superman. Last time we saw Zod was the season finale for Season 5 and premiere for Season 6, in that he possessed Lex Luthor and was easily defeated by Clark in a 3 minute fight where at the end he was banished to the Phantom Zone. (This was very disappointing to fans, as Zod is this great villian and was easily disposed of, and in the form of Lex. Don't get me started on how easily Darkseid was defeated in Season 10! Darkseid is a demigod, and he was defeated so...nevermind)Clark finally wears a REAL COSTUME (not the red jacket/blue t-shirt deal. And I like the black costume over the red leather jacket costume in Season 10! He looks like Flash Gordon with an S on his chest! ) The Blur's black costume is reminiscent of Superman's black Kryptonian costume from the comics (and perhaps from the Tim Burton version when he was picked to direct 'Superman Lives', the cancelled movie where Superman wore an all black costume) and we finally see him wearing his family crest (the 'S') on his chest. The whole back and forth with Clark and Zod was very similar with Clark's relationship with Lex, as they befriended each other at first (although Clark is never truly trusting of Zod, knowing what his older self turned into)Clark and Lois' romantic relationship develops, we are introduced to Metallo, we see more of Green Arrow and meet his new sidekick Mia (known as Speedy in the comics), we see Jor-EL in the flesh and Krypton in the episode 'Kandor', (which shows the friendship Jor-EL and Zod had, similar to Clark and Lex)and we meet the Justice Society of America (Featuring a super hero cast of Hawkman, Dr.Fate, Stargirl, Star-Spangled Kid, Sandman, and villian Icicle). And finally, behind the scenes we see Checkmate, the secret government organization bent on taking down superhumans, believing they are a major threat to mankind.Overall, a huge improvement on the disappointment of Season 8 (the Doomsday storyline, very poor writing, many holes in the plot, terrible climax! And why get rid of Jimmy?) and in my opinion better than any other season, including Season 10.Just one complaint I have about ALL of Smallville's episodes: The human characters have had to have MULTIPLE CONCUSSIONS as they have been thrown across rooms so many times and have been knocked unconscious! And they have been in Smallville and Metropolis Hospitals MULTIPLE times, with HUNDREDS of injuries! Where are the scars? Human characters like Chloe, Lana, Lois, Lex, Oliver, Tess, Jimmy, Martha, etc.. have ALL had injuries to their body and face, yet they have no scars!? Hmmm....",N/A

Well...you know how every DVD has all kinds of praise from people you don't know on the cover. That's all that is. If you're country it's a strong movie. If you're city it's the wrong movie.This is a pretty good movie and it gets 5-stars if you live in Tennessee and it gets 1-star if you are from New York.There is no denying the fact Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the greatest actors of all time just for the fact very few actors can turn in a legit redneck performance.

McGraw is good in the role of ""Husband"" to 40-something chicks in movies. It's just his role. He's good at it.The old skool country music is really great in this movie but if you don't like country don't bother. The entire movie looks like it was filmed in and around the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, a hotel room, a tour bus and a bar. By that I mean it could have all been done in the same 1/4 of a mile radius with some stock road sign footage added. Not a lot of scenery that's going to ""pop"" on the Blu Ray.It's like you got some really top of the line cameras, your best female friend was a great actor, everyone else was just glad to be there, you wrote a decent script but didn't have enough money to travel so you stayed in one spot in one Tennessee town and made a movie.Country Strong couldn't carry Coal Miner's Daughter's spitcup but it would look good with it in a DVD two-pack at Wal-Mart.",N/A
1416851,"Tarsem Singh is a true visual artist. His films include The Cell and The Fall. Both are visually striking, dramatically satisfying films, at once riveting and horrific. Both films contain unforgettable images. The Cell is a masterpiece of abhorrent beauty. The Fall is a haunting piece of eye candy with a heart-wrenchingly powerful story at its core. Tarsem is a talented man - yet it seems that he has finally decided to sell out, to squander his talents on mainstream macho-trash.The Immortals comes from the same ilk as 300, meaning that it's an overproduced action film, largely filmed using green screen technology, opting for style over substance. It tells the tale of Thesius, a young mortal who is sent on a mission from Zeus. The objective is to lead an army against King Hyperion, an evil tyrant who is trekking across Greece to obtain a coveted weapon - a magical bow and arrow, no less - which has the power to release the titans and annihilate all of humanity.Throughout the course of the film, Thesius crushes a few skulls, deflowers an innocent oracle, annoys the gods to no end, and unsuccessfully attempts to rescue his mother from the likes of Mickey Rourke, who shatters a man's testicles with a croquet mallet for kicks, and wears an awkward little mask with unnecessarily large horns throughout the majority of the film. Speaking of which, there isn't a character in this film that doesn't get to wear a funny hat. Lampshades, snail and clam shells, chandelier prisms - anything is up for grabs in the hat department, according to the costume designer of The Immortals.The acting is mediocre from all involved. Mickey Rourke is simply miscast. He grumbles and mumbles his lines. He seems bored and indifferent. Henry Cavill shows plenty of machismo and gets to scream and twirl around in slow motion a lot. As for Stephen Dorff - well, I'm still not sure what he is doing in this film. As with Rourke, he seems out of his element. The writing leaves much to be desired. This film contains laughably inept dialogue, and the characters are poorly realized. The visuals may be three-dimensional, but you can't say the same for the people on the screen.The direction is frustratingly dull. There is definitely some eye candy to be seen, but it does not feel like a Tarsem film. It feels like a Zack Snyder rip-off.

220286,"One of the most underrated films of all time. The dry humor is laugh out loud funny. It just keeps socking you.Matthau is a pernicious delight in this dark fable of murderous greed and ultimate submission.  Socially awkward to the point of creepiness, May shines as the hapless victim and George Rose is hilarious as Matthau's butler.Henry Graham (Walter Matheau) is pompous and self absorbed, and has a big problem: he has run through his entire inheritance and completely unequipped to make a living outside being a gentleman bachelor of independent means. His guardian, Uncle Harry (James Coco!!!!), refuses to give him a dime.Henry is unwilling to commit suicide so he devises a plan with the help of his butler Harold George Rose), who is also motivated for Henry to have a solution because he fears looking for a job as a butler and gentleman's gentleman (valet) as opportunities for the lost art are thin on the ground. Henry needs money the old-fashioned way: marry it.Henry has just six weeks to find a rich bride and repay a loan that Uncle Harry gives him at punitive terms. Henry must forfeit all of his property if the loan isn't made good.Desperation sets in as Henry's poorly executed efforts to meet a suitable girl all fail. So with only days remaining on his deadline, Henry bumps into clumsy, painfully shy heiress Henrietta Lowell (Elain May, who also directs). A mailable Galatea, Henrietta is the answer to his prayers.Henrietta's suspicious lawyer Andy McPherson (Jack Weston) is a problem for Henry, as is his own revulsion for marriage (in a remarkable departure for Hollywood, Henry is apparently asexual or has the libido of a glass of ice water). But Henry considers his marriage to be a temporary inconvenience, since he plans to kill Henrietta  as soon as possible.Murder never far from his mind, Henry takes charge of Henrietta's life. He reorganizes her household staff, which has been taking advantage of her timidity and naivete. For example, Henrietta takes the bus everywhere becasue the servants are so busy, evne though she has a driver and multiple cars. Becasaue Henrietta is completely disorganized and recognizes her own weakness she welcomes Henry's manily take-charge attitude. She even notesthat he has the academic credentials to teach at a junior college, like herself.For Henrietta is a botany professor, and discovers a new species of tree fern and names it after Henry. She loves Henry and invites him to join her on a canoe trip to a remote area on a research trip for her work.I won't spoil the heart-warming ending. For this is a dark comedy with rays of grace.Directed by May from her screenplay and based on the short story The Green Heart by Jack Ritchie.

975885,"This is a quintessential Ozu film, with unforgettable performances by two Ozu luminaries, the beloved Setsuko Hara as Noriko, and Chishu Ryu as her father, Shukichi Nomiya. Obasan Masa is played by Haruko Sugimura, another Ozu regular, who often plays the role of the meddlesome matchmaking auntie.The story could not be simpler. Noriko, at 27, is approaching the limit of marriageable age for Japanese women. She lives with her father, a professor, and cares for him in a mutually symbiotic relationship. However, the people around her, her friend Aya-chan (herself a divorcee) and Aunt Masa, are pressuring Noriko to marry. The professor, also, is eventually persuaded by their arguments.Masa is keen to see Shukichi remarry as well as his daughter, and she proposes a match with a younger widow. Shukichi is uninterested, but Masa plants a seed of doubt in Noriko's mind, and when she and her father see the widow at a Noh performance, she is inflamed with jealousy.Obasan proposes an arranged marriage for Noriko with a candidate she knows. Noriko refuses to consider it, but when she is told that her father intends to remarry, she confronts him. He lies, telling her that he does indeed intend to marry the widow, the one they saw at the Noh performance. This pivotal scene is played to perfection by Chishu Ryu, who affirms his marriage intentions with such ambiguity that one might easily absolve him of any untruthfulness. Shukichi later describes this as `the biggest lie I ever told.'Believing that her blissful twosome is about to end, Noriko bows to inevitability and reluctantly accepts the proposal of the suitor Obasan has picked out for her. On the eve of her wedding, she pleads with Shukichi one last time: she wants to go on as they are with no change. In a very eloquent and moving speech, he tells her that she must marry because it is the right and natural thing to do. His life is nearing its end. It will not be easy, as his own marriage to Noriko's mother was not, but if she will endure, she will find true happiness ultimately.We see Noriko in her bridal attire. In the final scene, Shukichi peels an apple, awkwardly as if he is unaccustomed to the task (which in fact is true, since Noriko has always done these tasks for him). He nods and apparently falls asleep. Though Roger Ebert interprets this last scene as an expression of the old man's grief, I don't see it quite that way. Ebert elsewhere superimposes his own values on Ozu's film:""What happens at deeper levels is angry, passionate and -- wrong, we feel, because the father and the daughter are forced to do something neither one of them wants to do, and the result will be resentment and unhappiness.""I believe this does not do justice to the complexity of Ozu's art. That both Noriko and her father are content with their arrangement and would prefer not to change it is unquestionable. The pressures that force them to leave that arrangement behind are inexorable: the force of time passing more than social mores. Shikata ga nai, is how the Japanese would express it: ""It can't be helped."" Will resentment and unhappiness follow?"" Perhaps, or perhaps adjustment and resignation, followed by contentment.In Autumn Afternoon, another Ozu film, there is a scene in which Hirayama goes to call on his old professor, `The Gourd' to deliver a gift of money collected from his classmates. The old man lives with his grown daughter, in this case well past marrying age. After the guests have left, she breaks down and sobs. Within the context of this film, I believe it is clear that this woman is grieving for the life that has passed her by. Compelled by tradition to care for her widowed father, she has missed the chance to marry and have a family of her own, and she now faces a solitary old age.In this as in Ozu's other films, the subtleties of the Japanese family dynamic are explored with extraordinary sensitivity. For those unfamiliar with the work of this legendary director, Late Spring is an excellent",Late Spring
1329090,"I liked this movie because it seemed like you were really watching a couple start with freshness and innocence and than gradually go thru meltdown. They portrayed the relationship with energy that felt like it was really happening. The things I liked were the girls need for introspection throughout the film. I liked the way her relationship with him started. They were free and childlike. You could feel the fun in their acting. I liked the way she read to her grandma and shared an intimate connection with her. I liked the chance he gave to them to reconnect in a way that could inject a new beginning when he proposed they go to the future room. I love theme rooms. I liked when they tried to communicate and eat room service food, trying to find a way to relate again on the level they did in the past. I liked the little girls name.

In the 13th century King John (Giamatti) signs the Magna Carta, then reneges on it and begins a quest to bring the entire country back under his rule. When he reaches Rochester Castle he meets resistance, and the future of the country rests on this battle. I have never been a big fan of these types of huge epic mid-evil type movies. That said, I really, really enjoyed this one. This is not for those who are disturbed by violence and blood. This is very gory in some parts, to the extent of cutting off someones arm and then beating someone with it. I loved it, but it's not for everyone. The main problem with this movie is that when the action is not going on it movies a little slow. But the action that takes place more then makes up for the slow moving parts. The acting alone takes this movie from a cheesy B-movie that could have been on the Scy/Fy channel into a more legit movie. Overall, very bloody, very gory, very good acting, very good movie.

58082,"Viewed: 10/11Rate: 710/11: Every serious actor must have a boxing film whether there is actual boxing or not in it. And Daniel Day-Lewis becomes another victim to the long line of actors. So, the real question is: did he succeed in it? Well, he did well for what he could do, and it was a good Daniel Day-Lewis performance, but it's not in the same league as My Left Foot and The Last of the Mohicans. After doing The Boxer, he wouldn't do another film for next five years. Probably it was a very unsatisfying role for him. On the other side, the whole I.R.A. crap and the silly war of religions really killed the film for me because I couldn't care less. Even worse was the weak chemistry between Daniel Day-Lewis and (or should I say the non-existent acting from) Emily Watson. At least Brian Cox was pretty good himself in it. I do remember seeing The Boxer after it came out in 1997, and it was an unremarkable picture back then. And it still is now. In fact, we still have no idea what Danny Flynn served fourteen years for. One aspect of the screen I am so sick and tired of is how blue (green, gray, brown, yellow, whatever) the vision is. Just use a clear lens, please. All in all, The Boxer is a decent film to watch for Daniel Day-Lewis alone.",N/A
25347,"I am familiar with who Samuel Fuller is but I'm not familiar with his films. This is only the second film I've seen by the man, having been intrigued by this film since hearing that it heavily influenced Martin Scorsese'sShutter Island. Now that Criterion has remastered and reissued the film, I felt it was time to give it a try. There doesn't seem to be a general consensus about this film; most people agree that it's good, but no one can decide if it's a campy B-movie, a socially conscious film noir, a hard-boiled pulp movie, or some combination of those. Watching Shock Corridor, a film that was released in 1963 I was struck by how ahead of its time it was.The film both begins and ends with the following quote:""Whom God wishes to destroyHe first makes mad""-Euripides, 425 B.C.Johnny Barrett (Peter Breck) is a reporter for the Daily Globe who believes he can win the Pulitzer Prize by being committed to an insane asylum to solve a murder.  His girlfriend Cathy (Constance Towers), a stripper, will pose as his sister and accuse him of ""attempted incest."" Cathy is opposed to the idea of having Johnny committed fearing the effects Johnny's stay will have on his psyche, but she's assured that everything will be fine. Johnny's act is convincing and he's committed to the asylum and housed in Ward B. The asylum is filled with some interesting patients (one male patient claims to be 5 months pregnant), not caricatures but not deeply rooted in reality either. Johnny finds a way of speaking with the patients that makes them return to sanity for a few moments, which is when Johnny can question them to get closer to the truth about the murder. Able to hear Johnny's inner thoughts, we slowly see his stay at the asylum begin to take hold of his sanity.Shock Corridor never settles comfortably into a particular genre nor does it seem to want to be so straight-forward. At any given moment it can seem like a varied take on the hardboiled detective genre, a surreal black comedy, a cynical social statement, and/or a devastating drama. Some have called it ""campy,"" but this isn't a term I'd apply to it. A scene where Johnny is attacked by a group of nymphomaniacs housed at the asylum comes dangerously close to camp territory, but as a whole it embodies so many types of genres that ""campy"" hardly enters the equation. Another scene has a patient who believes he's a general at Gettysburg recounting a memory of Japan, which appears in color. Finally, the man briefly recovers from his insanity, recounts what landed him in the asylum, before relapsing back to his previous state. This scene is remarkable, as it comes out of nowhere and is incredibly powerful.The most memorable patient may be Trent (Hari Rhodes), a young black man who steals pillowcases to make KKK hoods, while claiming to have invented the KKK and advocating white supremacy. Trent is unaware of his race and at one point chases an older black man before the man can ""marry his daughter.""  Trent's scenes also border on camp but I see them as being closer to dark comedy, as not only is this a brilliant piece of characterization but it's also satirizing the idiocy and hypocrisy of racism. Keep in mind, this film was released just a year before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This is pretty bold move for an American filmmaker, but one that retains its relevance even today.It seems clear from this film that Fuller was a brave filmmaker with a much different style from other directors of this time, as well as a willingness to push the envelope by taking his film places that most films of this period were unwilling or unable to go. The lurid subject, the execution, and Fuller's original and brilliant use of color footage (despite not being the first director to do so) come together to create a film that defies even some of today's cinematic conventions. Most recently, you can see this film's influence on Scorsese's Shutter Island (similarities are immediately noticeable) but it's influence seems to have extended far beyond Scorsese. Johnny's dreams of Cathy, for example, seem directly out of a David Lynch film.Shock Corridor is a rare film that doesn't appear to have aged significantly. It remains a disturbing, brilliantly written, and well-made piece of filmmaking that is likely just as good as it when it was first released. It has made me an instant fan of Samuel Fuller and is undeniably worthy of the Criterion treatment. It's ahead of it's time and feels incredibly modern despite being nearly 50 years old. I can't pay it a higher compliment, don't overlook this film.GRADE: A",N/A

1508103,"""Moneyball,"" directed by Bennett Miller with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian, is based on the Michael Lewis bestseller of the same name.  Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, a once promising young ballplayer who never made it in the big leagues.  Now he is the general manager of the Oakland A's, a team that is about to lose its best players.  With a budget that will not allow Beane to compete financially with more prosperous teams, Beane hires a twenty-five year old Yale graduate named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an economics major who has come up with a unique computer program.  According to Brand, Beane can make the A's competitive in spite of their minuscule payroll.Some critics have said that you don't need to love or understand baseball to appreciate ""Moneyball.""  This is true only to the extent that anyone can appreciate fine acting.  Pitt is relaxed and understated; he expresses emotional pain and frustration with facial expressions as much as with he does with words.  He is a divorced dad who cherishes the limited time he spends with his daughter.  Although Beane is in his forties, he has enough self-confidence and chutzpah to tell his grizzled scouts (all wonderful veteran character actors) that he is the one calling the shots.  Hoffman plays the A's manager, Art Howe, with his usual expertise.  Howe has thinly veiled contempt for what he considers to be a hare-brained scheme, but is professional enough to do what he is told.  Jonah Hill is terrific as Brand, a young, overweight man with a constant look of terror on his face, as if he expects to be thrown out of the office at any moment.  Why does Beane put it all on the line in this outrageous manner?  He says, ""I hate losing more than I love winning,"" and for some reason, Brand's ideas resonate with him.The script is an unsentimental and straightforward account of what happened in the 2002 season, when the A's won an unprecedented twenty games in a row.  ""Moneyball"" does not leave us with the notion that Brand's method is foolproof, since if it were, the A's would have continued their winning ways indefinitely.  Instead, this film is a character study of a courageous man who risked not only his position but also the derision of his more experienced colleagues by making a series of unconventional moves.  Beane and Brand had the temerity to suggest that although money is certainly needed to buy first-rate talent, it is sometimes possible to field a winning team without breaking the bank.",N/A
987809,"Tsotsi is a powerful, powerful film. I haven't seen a lot of South African Cinema but this film is really something. The story is so moving and the acting is superb. I think that because I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, the film was all the more special and delicate. The characters were believable and the story was so touching, so moving and so surprisingly realistic. I plan to watch more films by Gavin Hood because of this film. I personally thought the lead character, Tsotsi to be rather feminine at times. I thought this helped in making his character really reach the masses. He is a character that is both sensitive and fiercely cruel; an odd pairing but a pairing that works. I personally thought the part when Tsotsi drives off with the baby to be a bit much, almost too much for me to handle, but as the story progressed it made the film (obviously) and it made the film gripping `til the end. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film was the music that accompanied it... it was fitting and true to the mood of the different parts of the film. I thought it was rather interesting how the music would be incorporated too, in that sometimes it was jarring and interruptive, but ultimately, it proved to work for the film given that the film was told as a cause and effect sort of way. I would watch this film again and again; I absolutely loved this film. I am a big foreign film fan and this one has taken the cake this year.

And to this very day, I can't see this movie without being stunned by Deborah Foreman's beauty - 25 years later and it's never gotten to the point where I'm weary or finding myself having 'moved on'. She is, for me, the epitome of sweet sexuality blended within a complex mix of quirky fun and raw energy. If I were to compare her to another actress - the only one that even comes close would be Carole Lombard. Interestingly, while writing this review, I did a Google Image Search for a recent picture - and I was stunned to see that's she's just as beautiful today as she was back then. Amazing genes. Amazing smile.In this film - and in my opinion her best role in such a short career - she plays hapless dishwasher Casey Meadows. And like so many fairy tales, begins with a beautiful girl trapped in a miserable life.Until the one day when a mysterious envelope is delivered to her dungeon-like existence.Contained within that envelope is a job offer to become a luxury limousine driver. It's her ticket out, if she can hang on long enough to cash it.Her arrival to the staid chauvinist all-gentleman's club begins a hilarious and genuinely fun romp as we ride along with her multitude of escapades & adventures. Everything from dealing with insane clients to earning respect from her mean-spirited fellow drivers. Simultaneously, there's an intriguing understory, a secret that will engulf all the main characters and potentially undo all the good deeds her guardian angel has quietly positioned for Casey's future prospects.There are so many tender and really touching scenes (some might describe them as unabashedly sentimental) that, admittedly, do tend to hail from the Dickens-school of dramatics. And equally there are some insanely hilarious moments and one incredibly romantic scene, gratefully without the cheap trope of lead actress nudity. Notably, there's also a memorable hefty meat display for the ladies in there too, as rugged Sam Jones puts on quite a show. &lt;g>And speaking of which - this movie is also a poignant highlight in the career of the handsome actor. He was at the peak of his virility; his thespian skills and his timing were pitch perfect as the detached executive and scion to the corporation founded by his kind-hearted father, played by the inimitable E.G. Marshall. He would, in my opinion, never again achieve this level of quality performance. And I take absolutely no pleasure in saying that because, like so many people, I have a soft spot for underdogs; truly celebrating when career character actors like Terry O'Quinn hit the right roles and suddenly become breakthrough stars. Unfortunately for Jones, just like fellow 80's macho man Ken Wahl, he just seemed to catch all the wrong breaks at the wrong times. There's so much unfulfilled potential in his resum&eacute;.Thankfully, under the direction of David Beaird, the lead actors put on a clinic of how to do a romantic-comedy in the best traditions of legendary teams likeWilliam Powell and Myrna Loy. 'My Chauffeur' is an extremely enjoyable flick in the old school tradition that will entertain, tickle and charm its way into the hearts of romantic souls.Couple of Notes:- I have to make mention of the amazing dream-inspired opening soundtrack by Michael Galasso. It succinctly captures the essence of Casey Meadows and her story. I only wish it were commercially available.- Leland Crooke, a favorite character actor, was never funnier as the Johnny Rotten-like punk rock singer.

1324210,"This movie does not deserve the hype it is getting.Having now watched the movie and discussed it with many of its fans and read the favorable reviews, it appears the appeal of this movie is a) that it's ""smart"" and b) that it reveals the grand irony that the founder of the world's most popular social network is in fact a total jerk.I was not impressed with the movie on an intellectual level. The movie is essentially about the creators of Facebook, and not about the nature of facebook per se, its hidden privacy controversies and the fact of that such a shallow and virtually useless site is so popular in our soulless times. These to me are intellectual issues worth making various movies about, yet interestingly enough they are issues fans of the movie are quite oblivious of. Instead we get a movie about the creation of facebook and the petty controversies over intellectual rights (among the creators) for the site. Mr Zuckerberg as portrayed in this film is indeed a rather interesting persona himself, yet this socially inept, backstabbing cyber genius smacks too much of an antihero, that bad guy you like. Is it any wonder that in a time filled with so many egotistical, narcissistic facebook and twitter bloggers that this movie has been heralded as best film of the year and Zuckerberg as 2010 Person of the Year? That to me is just depressing.Visually, the movie has nothing to offer. It's just 100% of the time people in rooms arguing. What they argue about (the intellectual rights to facebook among the creators) is only very vaguely interesting. Director, actors and composer do everything in their power to make said talking appear profound by talking super fast in noise-filled clubs, but it didn't help (in fact it made it more difficult to follow). The ending/resolution is abrupt and highly anticlimatic.In short, this movie lets facebook users feel like they've learned a great deal about the site without compromising their own role in the site. People who watch the film come out saying whatever they like about Zuckerberg, but in the end they'll go home to their computers, mindlessly refreshing their facebook walls, posting status updates that no one really cares about, and adding complete strangers with whom they have nothing in common to their ""friends"" list, without once questioning why they feel compelled to do so. Nor, moreover, will they come out any more enlightened as to the dangerous role Facebook has played in undermining our privacy. The movie aims the lens at the wrong people (the creators rather than the users), leaving us with little more than a movie about annoying people making money.",N/A

686403,"Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet may be the most commonly read and performed story in the western world, but as Covent Garden has proved, that doesn't mean it can't still be thrilling and exciting. I had the pleasure of viewing Gounod's Rom&eacute;o et Juliette, in a production from 1994 at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. In 2011, when the edgy and radical opera production is the fad, it was refreshing to see a production where concepts were clear and the production values reflected the story. Nicolas Jol's set had mostly white, grey, and light blue tones, which fit the tragic tale, but left a certain something to be desired that might have added to the romantic aspect of the plot.  However, this certainly did not detract from the fine performances and the director's commitment to convey the story.Few sopranos in the world could have honored the role of Juliette as well as Leontina Vaduva did in this performance. She gave a studied and carefully crafted portrayal. Her eyes were constantly focused, alive, and aware of the action. Her entire being was dedicated to Juliet's complex emotional variations throughout the entire opera. The soprano's voice seemed to shine even in the most tender and dramatic moments. I can't say Vaduva had the limpid lightness of voice that ""Je veux vivre"" requires, but her ""Amour, ranime mon courage"" was as close to perfection as one gets.  Seeing the horror and disgust in her eyes as she sang of the idea of awaking, entombed alive and touching her dead cousin, was educational to any young singer in the art of conveying words while not sacrificing singing. Vocally, each onset was light; yet, she was able to manage thrilling dramatic passages without wavering on beauty of sound. Vaduva is one of the most compelling singing actresses I've had the delight of watching.Roberta Alagna sang Rom&eacute;o with consistency and control, but was dramatically lacking, at times. Credit is rightly given to his singing ability, as he is a truly capable tenor whose dramatic vocal powers were at his whim. While I have no doubt that Alagna studied and understood Rom&eacute;o, Alagna's acting lacked subtlety and nuance. I didn't understand why a flighty and bouncy Juliette would want to hold the hand of a person who seemed too serious and intense for her bright youth. In addition, many times throughout the performance Alagna just stopped and simply sang to the audience. While I don't feel that his acting was any less studied than many singers who have graced the operatic stage, his flaws were revealed all too well (but inadvertently) by his costar's truly seasoned performance.Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet adapts to opera very well. Jules Barbier and Michel Carr&eacute; had to shave the story down for musical purposes, but included the basic plot points. This resulted in my finding that I could sit back and truly enjoy the performance for its music and the drama and not worry about catching every single word. This was supported by the production, which was non-distracting from the story, as many modern-day productions tend to be.  I rate this performance a 4 out of 5, losing the one point because of the set and costume's slightly tired and reused look. However, the performances were largely satisfying. I highly recommend this production for anyone who'd like to see what I believe Gounod would have intended - the opera's story and music standing on their own as a great work of art.","Gounod - Romeo et Juliette / Mackerras, Alagna, Vaduva, Royal Opera Covent Garden"

If something in my family's plans changed and for some reason, I wasn't able to watch it, I was super-bummed.Sometimes things you loved as a kid aren't quite as good when you go back to see it as an adult.  It's not as awesome as you remembered it.This isn't like that.  It's still super-awesome!Granted, some of the dialogue is cheesy & soap-opera-ish.  That's part of the charm.  It's like Jackie Chan movies being a little cheesy (think 'Rumble in the Bronx'), it's part of the appeal.The animation is way ahead of it's time.  It's freakin' fantastic.  The story/universe they've created is amazingly creative.The first series is a tragedy.  There are parts that are depressing.  It's war.  It's not sugar coated. Characters that you've developed affinity for die.  The first series is the pinnacle, though all of them have something sweet to offer.The second series is my next fav., with the third series being my least favorite.The DVD collection has some cool extras as well, like a hour long movie that I believe never made it to TV.  In the timeline, it takes place immediately after the first series.Besides the Shadow Chronicles which came out much, much later, there is nothing else Robotech offers.

I didn't read the track listing before buying (though it doesn't matter, since I bought it for the movie and the CD was just bonus). So it doesn't have the actual songs I really wanted, like ""Maa"", ""Bum Bum Bole"", ""Mera Jahan"" etc... I found those on iTunes, however. Also, if you search ""taara Zameen Par"" here on Amazon it will pull up two different albums that have the songs on them, though with different names. For example, ""Bum Bum Bole"" is called ""Dekho Dekho"". It's rather confusing.So, the point of this review is so people aren't surprised when they pop in the CD in the CD player and can't find those popular songs, like I was. Either way, hey, free soundtrack with the price of the movie.",Like Stars on Earth
1286350,"I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8"" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6"" apart. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.I have the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring from the early 1990's and thought it was time to upgrade with this Valencia Cycle.There has been enough said about the video aspect of these performances and the singers, but few details about the audio except that it is excellent. I beg to differ. I have listened to all 4 performances once and the Rheingold now twice for this review with the DTS HD-MA track.The orchestra is recorded fine. The sound stage goes about 2-3 feet beyond the front corner speakers to the left and right.EDIT: After listening to it again, the orchestra is also reversed in the surround mode. If you listen to the stereo track 2:55 into the recording, the french horns are on the left, where they are actually sitting. When you then listen to it in the surround mode, they come from the right, i.e reversed. END OF EDIT.The voices is another story.First, the left and right front stage microphones have been reversed. You can hear this clearly at about 18:15 into the performance. First sings the Rhine maiden in the middle and her voice comes from the center. Then sings the left maiden, but the sound comes from the right. Then sings the right maiden and the voice comes from the left. Never had anything like that.Most recordings try to have the voices go along with the singers, i.e. when a singer goes across the stage, the voice also goes across the stage. A few send the voices mostly through the center like Villazon/Machaidze's  Romeo and Juliet. Here the video direction centers the singers and it appears natural.In this Rheingold, the voices come mainly from about 2 feet to the left of the center with some strange anomalies.At 30:49 Wotan is left of Fricka, but Fricka's voice is left of Wotan.At 38:06 Fricka is on the far right of the stage, voice is from left.Whenever the action is on the right, the voices come from the left with few exceptions. But when the action is on the left, the voices come mostly from the left, too.But at 2:08:13 Fasold is on the left, his voice is in the middle.At 2:14:46 Fasold moved to the right, his voice is now left.At 2:17:15 Erda appears on the far left of the stage, but the sound comes from the right.At 2:21:05 Wotan to the right of Erda, his voice is left of her voice.The reversal of the stage microphones explains most of the anomalies, but not everything. Why not more sound from the right, when they are left.?Philipp Knop could probably tell us what went wrong. He is given credit for the stereo and surround mix.With the performance so much utilizing the projections in the background and wide stage shots required for that to work, the misallocation of the voices just ruins this for me. To see Wotan on the right and to hear him from the left is just goofy.If you watch it on a 32"" screen and your loudspeakers are 36"" apart, you probably won't notice. In my setting, very noticeable.The other 3 parts of the Cycle are essentially the same. EDIT: They are not the same and I'll review them separately. END OF EDIT.",N/A
724267,"The Barber (Michael Bafaro, 2002)Like at least half the other people who have watched and reviewed this, I picked it up (a) because it contains Michael McDowell and (b) expecting it to entirely suck. And like at least half of those, I ended up being very pleasantly surprised; while it's as predictable as they come (and that's not usually a good thing in a murder mystery), it's black comedy pedigree is long, and for once a low-budget director actually put together a cast of people you've never heard of by asking the question, ""who can we get for this movie who won't look like a seventh-grader in a school play next to Malcolm McDowell?"" The results are not only gratifying, but should be required viewing for aspiring low-budget murder-mystery directors who use their entire budgets on one big name until the end of time. (You think that's a vertical market? I just described 90% of the movies on the Lifetime Movie Network. Think about it.)Dexter (McDowell) is the barber in a small town of Revelstoke, Alaska, well above the Arctic Circle and plunged into darkness for large portions of the year. (More on this later.) As the movie opens, a couple of drunk hunters stumble across the body of Lucy (Jennifer Martinez in her first screen role), wife of the town eccentric and dispatcher for the local cab company. (This town is big enough to have a cab company?) Corgan (Unforgiven's Jeremy Ratchford), the town sheriff, starts to investigate, but the next day, the FBI, in the form of Agent Crawley (Get Carter's Garwin Sanford), arrives and takes over the case. The deeper we get into the investigation, the more interesting dirt turns up. But then a second body appears, and both Crawley and Corgan begin to unravel things--but both of them have different prime suspects.From the reviews I've read, it seems to me that the division between the movie's viewers is along a very clear line: whether you viewed this movie as a comedy or not. Those who went into it expecting a straight serial killer film are inevitably disappointed, but those who went with the dry humor enjoyed it a great deal more. Food for thought. Bafaro (11:11, The Devil's Ground) is a capable director, but not much more than that, so the film relies almost solely on its acting for strength, and a lot of the folks to be found here deliver. But then, when you've got Alex from A Clockwork Orange and the Schofield Kid from Unforgiven going head to head, it's not exactly your normal no-budget movie, is it?If you're going to be outraged about something, make it the ways in which the truth gets stretched here. Revelstoke, for example, is actually in British Columbia, not Alaska, and is pretty well below the arctic circle (it's along the Trans-Canada Highway, and is at roughly the same latitude as Calgary, AB (were you to move it due east, that would be about three hundred miles north of the tip of Maine, give or take). And despite what Steve Niles may tell you, there is no thirty days of night to be found anywhere on the American landmass, much less the seemingly endless time posited by Bafaro (per Barrow's wikipedia entry, the shortest day of the year still experiences three hours of twilight). But picking on the acting, as some reviewers I've seen so, is simply wrong, and picking on a low-budget filmmaker for making a low-budget film is senseless. If you picked it up at your local big-box store for $2.50 expecting Casablanca, that's your fault, not the movies. For those of us with lower expectations, it's not a bad little film. Not the best thing I saw last week, but certainly not the worst. ** 1/2",The Barber

747052,"Many big-time spoilers included here.It's very clear that Lars von Trier has a penchant for digging his nails into the festering wounds of the human psyche, which is almost invariably grist for the psychopathological mill. An asset of this film is that, in disarming the legend of Medea of its fantastic/mythical qualities, and thus ""reducing"" it to a story about a rejected woman who seeks revenge for the slight committed against her, it resonate a lot more with everyday experience, allowing it to shape itself according to our notion of reality. This can be terrifying, especially with the subject matter at hand. Some authors have argues that there is an infanticidal urge in all mothers, whether conscious or not (usually the latter). Those who act on it are usually portrayed as demonic and/or insane. This is a massive denial of the murderous tendencies present in all living creatures, a denial which seems necessary since it allows people to have some semblance of control over their minds and actions. But, given the right circumstances, the illusion is shattered, and a new balance needs to be reached. In the case of Medea, her narcissistic wound is too great to bear, yet the perpetrator cannot be attacked directly (for whatever reason). Her sexuality is rejected, thus she proceeds to destroy any evidence of his. She murders his bride-to-be as well as some of her family members. The epitome of her acts is the killing of her 2 children, which happens in a very matter-of-fact manner. The ""intruder complex"" can be felt in the mind of the eldest son, who gladly assists in killing the younger brother, pulling him down as he hangs helplessly from the tree. He thus fulfills his own unconscious wish of destroying his uterine rival. Her ""psychogenic sterility"" is accomplished, and she can depart. Again, the more realistic tones to the film are a huge asset.. she sits on a ship, waiting for the tide to carry them away... had the golden chariot of Helios, pulled by winged dragons, flown her away holding her dead sons with her, perhaps the impact wouldn't have stuck... score one for the director.",Medea
1371938,"This was a very welcomed surprise.  Instead of constantly shooting for awkwardly un-funny off-color remarks, one after the other, or just merely yelling at everyone all the time, Adam Sandler and company crafted a nicely woven film that is sweet, smart and funny.  This has a LOT to do with the fact that Jennifer Aniston is flawless here.  Sandler is apparently the type of guy that needs a strong woman at his side in order to anchor his films.  When he relies on his fellow male comedians his films fall to pieces, but his collaborations with the likes of Drew Barrymore and now Aniston have proven that his over-the-topness can be tamed by the fairer sex.In `Just Go With It', Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who had his heart trampled on when he was younger and has vowed to never get married.  When he discovered that drunk women tend to react kindly (and often passionately) to a married man with a horrible wife he started wearing a wedding ring and spewing sob stories to pick up chicks.  Then he meets a bombshell and falls, instantly, in love with her.  He doesn't even want to lie to her because after one magical evening in the sand the two decide that this could be something `real'.  But then she finds his fake wedding ring in his pant pocket and he has to come up with some sort of lie in order to keep her interested in him, so he convinces his assistant to pretend to be his `soon to be ex' wife, and then suddenly her kids become his kids and his cousin becomes her new lover and they all wind up in Hawaii where things just spiral out of control until...Well, I'm sure you'll figure out within the first few minutes who is going to wind up with who.So, this film is swimming in chemistry.  That is one thing that really made this so worth watching.  Adam Sandler tones down his crudeness in order to keep up with the classy humor surrounding Aniston.  She is a total star here, and really, it's shocking to say that this is one of her finer performances.  I just loved the way she sunk into the `genre' without losing a sense of realism.  She is sharp and witty and aggressive, yet you always can see the subtle lines of longing in her eyes; that longing for normalcy in happiness.  Swardson is hilarious with an accent (and that sheep scene is priceless), Kidman is insanely manic, but in a good way, Bailee Madison is adoreable and has deft comedic timing that I'm sure she'll hone well.  Brooklyn has spotty moments of green acting, and then she recovers, but she's not hot enough to persuade eyes away from Aniston, who is a knockout here.Best I've ever seen her.At the end of the day, this is a predictable romp (and the ending is lazily put together in a rush attempt to tie up all loose strings), but it's heartwarming and quite funny.  In fact, I laughed from beginning to end, and they were genuine laughs that I'm anxious to revisit!",N/A

1339991,"American moviemakers don't have an especially impressive track record when it comes to adapting hit foreign films for stateside audiences (who generally avoid like the plague anything with subtitles).  But with ""Let Me In,"" a remake of the highly acclaimed Swedish film ""Let the Right One In,"" Hollywood finally gets one right.  This somber and chilling tale of a friendless, put-upon 12-year-old boy who becomes romantically (albeit platonically) involved with the vampire-girl next door emerges as a sort of antidote to the far more crowd-pleasing and commercially successful ""Twilight"" series, providing a more subdued and thoughtful variation on the same theme.Transferring its setting from Scandinavia to an equally frigid and snowbound Los Alamos, New Mexico, the remake remains true to the core elements that made the original such a quality film in the first place:  its artful tone, its unsensationalistic approach to its material, and its incisive look at what it means to be a misfit in a world in which conformity is prized above all else - and never more so than during adolescence.  For Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) are both outcasts from society, Abby quite literally since her condition makes it impossible for her to interact with others in any kind of meaningful way (except to devour their blood).  But Owen is no less of an outsider, since his diminutiveness, shyness and dreamy nature make him an easy and perpetual target for the town's bullies.  It's no surprise, then, that Owen and Abby eventually reach out to one another for love and acceptance, despite the seeming impossibility of their relationship.As a horror film, ""Let Me In"" doesn't hold back from showing us the requisite gore and grue that comes with the genre, but director Matt Reeve's script is far more concerned with the interaction among characters and the exploration of theme than it is with piling up easily achievable gross-out moments.  For instance, the gruesome task of securing victims that Abby and others close to her are forced to do to assure her continued survival helps to make this a profoundly sad and emotionally unsettling story.Smit-McPhee and Moretz are both superb as the inter-species Romeo and Juliet, and there's a fine supporting cast to boot.In this case at least, ""Let Me In"" is a command well worth obeying.",N/A

Peter Sellers' Clouseau was a very nuanced character, a man who may have been incompetent, but who went about his business very seriously. He realized when he made a mistake, and much of the humor arose for Clouseau's attempts to recover from his mistakes. Martin's Clouseau, by way of contrast, is simply a clown, who blunders through thinks completely unaware of the havoc he is creating, or of any of the effects of his actions. I suppose if you've never seen any of the original Peter Sellers films you might find Martin's slapstick enjoyable, but anyone who finds Sellers' Clouseau to be one of the great comic figures of film will find this movie (and its sequel) to be a huge disappointment.",N/A

647032,"This is one of the most imaginative and unique films I have seen in years. It is a dark fairy tale for adults and is not a children's movie. The film is a mixture of fairy tale and dark realism since it combines images from the Mediterranean's pre-Christian mythologies with the horror of Fascism in Franco's Spain. The overlap between these two concepts, classical mythology and fascism, is violence and threat as well as unreasonable power over the powerless. Myths often involve heroic action, often taken by an innocent person or child, that helps overcome the forces of evil. The film is very skillful in combining these concepts where they are verbalized by the mythical creatures but we see a parallel world in reality as the rustic peasants develop resistance to the forces of fascism.The transitional character between the fantasy world of mythology and the harsh world of fascist reality is a little girl, the daughter of the new wife of a Fascist officer. She travels between these world through an ancient labyrinth hidden in the woods outside the fascist compound. Here she meets mischievous fairies but also a somewhat threatening and mysterious faun who is ambiguous as to his full intentions. The faun is identified as Pan, the child of the god Hermes, who was the god of transitions and doorways. She is told she is the Princess Moana and must undertake 3 tasks to gain her rightful throne. As in many myths, this child is given three tasks to claim their rightful position with the gods. This puts our young heroine into danger not only when she is in the labyrinth performing tasks but also when she is with her mother and step-father among the fascist and hidden resistance fighters. The adventures within the mythological world with a giant toad full of slime to an amazing monster who is awakened when someone eats from his table and who sees through eyeballs in the palms of his hands.To achieve the tasks prescribed by the gods and to overcome the evils of fascism, resilience and creativity are required and so once again we see overlap between the two worlds. Monstrosity can be reflected in the world of imaginary monsters but also in the acts of the fascists as they torture and kill innocent villagers as well as resistance fighters.  The young female protagonist is not fully protected from the evil of her step-father by her weak mother, suffering with a difficult pregnancy and childbirth. She does not feel fully protected and she is indeed vulnerable to the dark gaze of her dark murderous step-father. She is most protected by the housekeeper who plays many roles in this complex film. Children may retreat into fantasy when threatened but this poor little girl finds a fantasy world that demand much of her and a real world full of real dark threats. This film has some of the best integration of fantasy and reality since A.S. Byatt's the Dijin in the Nightingale's Eye or the works of Borges.This film has a different feel to it from a Hollywood production, since it has some ragged ends and images that are more European than North American. This is part of the film's strength. The Pan creature for example would have probably been more of a Santa Claus with goat legs if the film had been made in Hollywood. Instead, he is mysterious and ambiguous in a world with little clarity.The child actress Ivana Baquero plays the child Ofelia. She does a super job. Sergi Lopez plays her evil, cruel, fascist step-father Captain Vidal. He is an excellent actor and he has the ability to radiate threat on the screen. All scripts, sets, costumes, special effects, and cinematography were excellent. It all comes together into a great film.",Pan's Labyrinth
1349017,"Horror films hardly ever end well, and that applies to the genre in more ways than one.  Barring some pretty revolutionary stuff to arrive during the 70's and 80's, it's been the 21st century that introduced us to the nihilistic torture porn; an offbeat resurgence of snuff, but still characteristically modern.  Well, to no one's surprise, with this kind of source material came some truly bleak concepts and franchises that still influence horror to this day, and likely will for at least another decade.The point is, with this bleakness arose an abrupt halt to those feel-good horror films that give the protagonists a free ride home, and even exhilarate the audiences with a fleeting glimpse of a sequel.  Nope.  Here, things hardly ever end well and, if you can guess what the other side of the coin may entail, both are something that Stamm's Exorcism struggles with.I feel obligated to let you know that things end abruptly and in undramatic fashion.  Don't ever forget this, and you will thank yourself by the time the credits start rolling.  Like any carnival of terror, it's not the departing that's worth remembering, but the arrival and experience; every jump and chill shouldn't be forgotten.  To hell with the sudden (bittersweet?) revelation that it was all an illusion as you walk into the bristling sunlight.Okay, well...keep that in mind because, unfortunately, The Last Exorcism needs to come to a close and while the results feel shockingly brief and uninspired, this is a thriller - in a horror's guise, no less - that knows where it's going for 95% of the time, and does so with grace.So, it is scary?  Definitely.  It's restrained, to be sure and, although that may have been used as a barometer in the past to separate the good horror from the bad, it doesn't always apply here.  Nonetheless, the imagery here is memorable enough, in no small part to a terrific setting and some particularly clever elements in association with the docu-style that's seldom exploited, so those who fear motion sickness can feel relieved.Hardly a faux documentary in the strictest sense of the word, Stamm's exorcism feels, nonetheless, like one of the more personal thrillers to emerge in years, very much due to some strikingly intriguing and powerful performances by Patrick Fabian and Ashley Bell.  Really, no matter how much of a bitter taste may be left in my mouth from its close, each and every recollection of one of Bells' show-stopping scenes brings me back down to reality, and assures me that this is something quite special.The other, Fabian, solely embodies all of the elements of the film that make it feel so unique, even if it really isn't.  There's an air of surreal horror at work here that few other films have captured on the nature of exorcism and, indeed, religion itself.  It embeds a true sense of intrigue and skepticism within all of us that's been missing in other iterations of the premise.  So many forget that Satan is understood as the father of lies and deceit.Being agnostic, it resonated with me, this analysis of his Unholy, putting the sheer might of religious belief into perspective, and the results are quite disturbing.  Needless to say, it sticks with you, this film. , and you'll be asking yourself questions that took quite some time to emerge in the first place.",N/A

I say it's my last set because this is Ward Bond's last season before passing away and the show wasn't the same after he was gone.  Not only is the scene in episode 9 with John Wayne legendary, but the episode contains generous amounts of footage Ford used from his 1950 movie, ""Wagon Master"" which also starred Ward Bond as a Mormon elder heading a wagon train west. Of course, ""Wagon Master"" was the inspiration for the TV show ""Wagon Train.""  It is interesting to see how many of the movie's scenes were used and how Ford was able to 'cut' into them with interaction between Major Adams, Bill and Charlie Wooster.I still recall the sad morning my fifth grade class in 1960 learned that Ward Bond had died. The sadness was compounded by the news that country singer Johnny Horton had died within hours of Bond's passing.

1399870,"I'm on the same boat as J.G. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I am a huge fan of the series having bought the DVDs and the Blurays for all 4 (so far) so I Was really looking forward to this. Throughout the movie there were a lot of suspension of disbelief (as you should) in any movie. Mainly on what cars can and can't do but there are some things that go to far.If it would have been in the context of fantasy (Harry potter casting a spell and a giant magical elephant pulls the safe out the window, or Yoda uses the force and pulls it out) Then YES by all means I can be like ""oh well it's a movie. The force is strong within him"".However, when it's 2 real cars pulling a real safe out of a wall I just can't swallow it. I really ruined the movie for me and should for anyone that's ever watched Mythbusters.

1356760,"This wonderful Warner Brothers release of four of Jim Carrey's films all in WIDESCREEN(contrary to the official Amazon blurb),is a package well worth getting.The upside is that the price is right,the down side is that they are on two dreaded double sided discs which are super prone to getting scuffed and/or scratched.If you are brave of heart dear DVD warrior then you may pass GO and collect two hundred dollars.Disc One,Side A finds Dumb and Dumber,released Dec/94 and starring Jim as Lloyd Christmas(!)and as his pal Harry Dunne played by Jeff Daniels.Directed by the Farrelly Brothers this is a well paced comedy that features gag after silly gag throughout.The boys live together;Lloyd is a limousine driver who becomes instantly infatuated with a fare and tries unsuccessfully to return a briefcase she left in the airport before leaving for Aspen,Colorado.It was really a deliberate drop of alot of cash for two thugs.Harry is a dog clipper who has converted his car into a giant hairy looking dog.Both guys lose their jobs on the same day and decide to return the briefcase to Aspen.Their trip as would be expected is chock full of faux pauxs and misadventures.When they finally arrive they get to return to briefcase and foil a kidnap plot in the process.The film ends as the two walk back home and miss the chance to get aboard a bus full of sun tan lotion promoting females.A really hilarious romp full of alot of guy humour and obvious gags but Carrey and(surprisingly)Daniels do a great job and have really good on screen chemistry together.The film has been transferred well and is in its' original a/r of 1:85:1.The only extras are cast bios,photo gallery and the original and international trailers.3 1/2-4 stars.Disc One,Side B reveals The Mask,released July/94 which stars Carrey as Stanley Ipkiss.He is a hopeless romantic but shy and lacks any kind of social life.His favourite TV viewing is old Tex Avery cartoons.One day he stumbles upon a strange wooden mask floating in the harbour of Edge City.He puts it on and it melds right into his skin transforming him into a cartoon like character who can whirl around like a Tazmanian Devil and has a strong and outgoing personality;the total opposite of him.He at first manages to get even with a few people that have done him wrong but over time he runs afoul of a local gang and the police who are hell bent on capturing and/or killing him,depending on the moment.In the end Stanley manages to corral the local gang and hand them over to the police and he gets the girl.The films fades out as Stanley throws the mask into the river.Well directed and edited this film could have gone way over the top and missed the mark but Carrey's performance is right on the money and the outrageousness of his character is something only he could have pulled off successfully.The film has been transferred well and is in its' original a/r of 1:85:1.Extras include:deleted scenes,commentary,trailer,featurettes-Return to Edge City,Introducing Cameron Diaz,Cartoon Logic and What makes Fido Run.Four stars.Disc Two,Side A finds Yes Man,released Dec/08.This one,kind of an off brother to Liar,Liar,has Carrey as everyman Carl Allan,a bank employee who has become somewhat of a social recluse.He would rather stay home than hang with his friends.One day an ex bank employee turns him onto a life altering lecture being given by an inspirational guru played by Terrence Stamp.It empowers Carl to make a pact with himself not to say no but from now on say yes to life.This he takes to extremes saying yes to everything.Slowly but surely his life does change and for the better.He helps alot of people in the process,gets a job promotion and finds in the end he has become a better human being for it.In short he gets a life and in the process gets the girl.The movie is a look at what positive thinking and making the right choices in one's life can ultimately achieve,and Carrey again plays the part wonderfully.The film is in its' original widescreen a/r of 2:4:1 and it has been transferred well.There are no extras.It's a feel good film that I give 3 1/2 - 4 stars.Finally Disc Two,Side B sees one of Jim Carrey's most underrated films and I think one of his best,The Majestic,released Dec/01.The film stars Carrey as Peter Appleton a budding Hollywood film writer.This is the early 50s and the McCarthy witch hunts are in full swing and Peter gets caught up in the sordid mess.He is let go of his position by the studio.After getting drunk he decides to go for a long drive up the Pacific Highway.Along the way his car plunges into a raging river and he survives only to hit his head on the bridge abutment.He is found the next day on a local beach and is taken into a town called Lawson.He has amnesia,however the townsfolk mistake him for a local war hero Luke Trimble who was MIA in WW2.When Luke's own father identifies him as his son Peter goes along with things, but all the time unsure and unable to recall all the things the townspeople say about him and his past.Just as Peter/Luke is melding into the towns life he gets his memory back and at the same time the Committee on UnAmerican Activity catches up with him,taking him back to Hollywood to appear before them.Under tremendous stress and questioning,Peter refuses to give in and basically tells the committee what they can do with their hearing and charges.Peter goes back to Lawson to see a girl he left behind only to be greeted at the train station by the entire town.The Majestic is a real feel good movie and it shows the acting chops Carrey has in the dramatic department.Not well received originally I think this is Carrey's best work dramatically and the film is one that needs a good reassessment.The film has been transferred well into its original widescreen a/r of 1:85:1.Extras include:cast and crew specs,additonal scenes,trailer,a featurette on The Hollywood Blacklist and the complete movie in a movie starring ex-Xena actors Bruce Campbell and Cliff Curtis.I give it 4-4 1/2 stars.All in all these two discs contain four of Jim Carrey's better films.They're on double side discs though so beware,but it's a great price for them and a must have for all Jim Carrey fans.Highly recommended.","4 Film Favorites: Jim Carrey (Dumb and Dumber, The Majestic, The Mask, Yes Man)"
612375,"This is the classic 70's sci fi show. It was cancelled NOT because of ratings but because of the very high cost to produce it. This is long before cgi effects. ( computer generated images) and it was extremely expensive to make. The cylons are machines that continue on the war of their reptilian masters who are now extinct. This is different from the newer galactica , which is a great show also.  The shows are very different but in some ways the same. Both are classics in my opinion.  This set is a good one , with all the series episodes available. However they didn't clean up these episodes.  They should have but such is the luck we fans get, dirt and scratches in a age where computers can fix the problem.  The set is worth owning and alot of fun. It was tv's answer to Star wars and it was alot campier than that movie series for sure. But it's a good romp and it was much loved by viewers , in fact one poor lad jumped off the golden gate bridge after hearing it was cancelled.  the rest of us moved on and were glad to enjoy the newer galactica which is  a dark and serious show.

Endless dark corridors don't automatically equate with horror, just unpaid electric bills.  And, as this was an illegal den of iniquity....I suppose everything came cheaply: the scientists/doctors and the research subjects (all disposable).  Since no one was worth saving, no need to care about any of the cast.  The story unfolds during a deposition, everything's already happened at that point so there aren't any surprises.  There's Ed Lauter as the mysterious head of this project (he's rarely onscreen).  He has a gun toting trigger happy henchman, Louis Mandylor (with an intermittent accent).  The rest of the cast is unknown and displays varying degrees of ability (from bad to worse).  Things only turned remotely interesting when the `Frankenstein' aspect of the story finally kicked in towards the end.

69114,"This is a pretty good movie based on Homer Hickam's autobiographical take on his years as a Sputnik-era high school rocket enthusiast in 1950's rural West Virginia.  Having read Hickam's bookRocket Boys (The Coalwood Series #1)before seeing the movie, however, made me aware of some of the film's awkward approach to developing the film adaptation.  In addition, having spent my early high school years in the 1960's launching Estes-type model rockets with my friends at a farm down the road gave me some insight into the world of Homer Hickam.For my taste, this movie spent too much time on the fictional melodrama of the supposed mine injury of Hickam's father instead of fleshing out its various characters.  The role of Hickam's girlfriend ""Valentine"" was not properly grounded in character development; nor did she correspond in any way to the girl of the same pseudonym in the book.  The most troubling deviation from the events described in the book (at least from my point of view) was that of the boys' search for a lost rocket to prove that it had not caused a fire.  The idea that simple ballistics calculations could somehow guide them to the location of the downed rocket was hard to swallow--as well as the fact that finding the rocket in such a way did not occur in the book.  Hey, if you are going to change an event from that of the book--please go with a substitution that is at least as interesting as one in the book!  From my experience with searching for much lower altitude rockets in just ten or so acres of corn fields, the idea that they could find a much higher altitude rocket downed in extensive forests seems implausible.I still liked this movie and encourage the reader to see it.  It captures the excitement of young people who first encounter the joy of discovery--especially for those interested in science and engineering.  This movie also makes the important point that you don't have to live in a major city or an affluent suburb to get the education and inspiration you need for a challenging and exciting career--the willingness to work independently is often the most important element in achieving success.",N/A
272481,"""A Big Hand for the Little Lady"" revolves around the events concerning the latest annual high stakes poker game attended by five rich and unscrupulous men. The progress of the game is always a secret, but many in the town regard it as a big event and crave news of its progress. When a family passing through town gets delayed by a bad wagon wheel, the father (a reformed gambler) wants to join the game. He is allowed to when the rich men see a chance to clean him out. A couple of big surprise twists liven things up, however.The movie is a masterpiece of cinema. Most of the story takes place in a dark backroom of a western hotel, with just a few characters involved, yet it is completely compelling from start to finish. Henry Fonda and Jo Anne Woodward give great performances, but the poker players, including stalwarts such as Jason Robards and Charles Bickford, are really just as good. Paul Ford comes in late with his usual amusing bombastic performance, and Burgess Meredith plays a fun role as well.The end of the movie comes as a total surprise, twice. :-)It is a true cinema classic, and a must see film for all movie lovers.",N/A
1412777,"There were so many things about this movie that did not ring true or seem believable.Start with the parents of the main character, the father a doctor who teaches at a university, and his mother-hen-all-warm-and-endearing wife. In their somewhat drab dining room, having dinner with their grown kids. Almost screams, 'Poor but honest, human, down-to-earth.' In other words, 'Don't hate Dad because he's a doctor and rolling in money!'Then there's the chubby son who supposedly is so smart that he made a killing in the field of technology. He's too dumb to put any money in the bank, so soon, we're seeing him, again, 'poor but honest and down-to-earth, with self-esteem issues, just like you and me!'What crap.After the titillation of lots of skin shown when Jake and Anne Hathaway have sex (that part is pretty believable), Jake's character, Jamie, who's supposed to be such an emotional clod that he talks over the live broadast of the towers falling on 9/11, Jake and Maggie (her character) get serious. It's really a very touching scene when he first admits that he loves her - that was worth watching for the acting and the message conveyed - but when he starts to focus on her disease, everything goes awry.I'll skip all the things that happen and just say that it could have ended with the lovely emotional scene that seems to resolve many issues. I loved that scene. Then it was all ruined by a coda in which Jake tells us that he made a moral choice and applied to medical school.ENNNGHHH! (sound of buzzer). Wrong thing to add to the movie. Jake's already admitted that he can't sit through classes, was aimless in college and dropped out. In the competitive world of medical admissions, even Dad (a university professor, remember) would have trouble getting a son who's decided he wants to be doctor now into medical school. A son who refers to himself as having ADD. And that is expected to wrap up all of the plot in a neat little bow so the happy couple retire healthy and wealthy (the understanding is that Maggie will then have her own live-in doctor watching the progress of her disease).Without that stupid, cloying, and unbelievable ending, I was willing to overlook the 'poor but honest' facade presented by a family basically rolling in money, with plenty of options in life and lots of financial security, but living 'the simple (and drab) life' as if it was some political statement. But with that dumb ending, I can really only recommend skipping through the movie to the last 15 minutes. It's all you really need to see - the rest is purely contrived and not believable.",N/A

684236,"This reminds me of Rohmer's ""Boyfriends & Girlfriends"" -- and exemplifies what a lot of folks who claim to dislike about ""foreign films"" really dislike: lots of talk, not a lot of action and subjects that are really mundane. Now, I don't say ""mundane"" in a bad way. The subjects of these films are things that could happen to me, you or anyone we know. They are infinitely easier to relate to your own real world conflicts and experiences. There are no easy resolutions.There are misunderstandings, hard feelings and none of it is terribly exciting, but it is important to you at the time. These films are a great snapshot of real life - or as real as you can get in a film. The characters are appealing, charming and real. There's no omniscient narrator providing insight into their thoughts -- so it is a bit more work.Since I had not read the synopsis in a while, I kept thinking ""OK, is this going to be a crush between Natacha & Jeanne"" or maybe the antagonism between Natacha and her dad's girlfriend was due to an attraction or history between the two (ie, they dated or had a fling?).I guess 24 films at Frameline in the course of a week will change your perspective on ambitions and motivations of characters in other, perfectly straight, films.

634678,"This movie could possibly be the best one Pixar has put out there.  The characters are all so cute, and cleverly thought out.  For instance, Mr. The King is a reference to Richard Petty, and Pixar does just about everything but come out and call him Mr. Petty.

It's almost like he enjoyed the filming.Could they have picked a better person for the redneck tow truck than Larry the Cableguy?  I don't believe so.  My favorite scene in the whole movie is the tractor tipping, which I can see Larry doing.  Same with George Carlin as the hippy van (it's probably the only role I've ever liked him in).Not only is the cast great, but the story is fantastic.

1329822,"No, I am not reviewing this film, Chloe, based on the story line of this rather mundane (and theme done before) psychological thriller (maybe) about an upper class American family (slightly dysfunctional, of course) who when doctor mom gets ""signals"" that professor dad is cheating on her in his (and her) old age (40-50 something, okay) who gets catch up in the thrall of what is euphemistically called a high end escort (a.k.a. ""hooker"", call girl, etc.). That's enough detail about the plot.What really interests me about this film is the sub-theme, the inter-generation lesbian theme that is rather graphic in its depiction. Here escort Chloe, through a series of machinations, beds doctor mom. And old lady doctor mom (and Chloe) likes it. Now the only reason that that theme resonates with me right now is that I have recently read Lillian Hellman's play The Children's Hour and seen the film (the 1961 version under that same name). That play and film with a very different plot line nevertheless deals rather more obliquely with lesbianism, almost as if it dare not speak its name (and it doesn't in the first film version of Hellman's play, These Three). So what makes Chloe of interest is as an example of how far, at least cinematically, we have come from the days when such topics, especially the ""hot button"" one of inter-generation sex, hetero, lesbian or otherwise, were relegated to underground movie houses or private viewings.",Chloe

That's the mindset I came into this film with & I ended up leaving somewhat disappointed, somewhat pleased by this film.The film's premise is so bizarre that you can't help but be curious. The idea of killer hair is one that hasn't been done very often so there's no worries about this film falling into too many cliches. They're here, but when you add the whole ""hair extensions will kill you"" factor into it those cliches become something new. When you add on the true horror aspect of the movie, the abuse of a small child, the film becomes truly cringe worthy.It's just that at the same time, this film wasn't particularly great. At times I got the impression that the director was deliberately trying to make a B movie, which both helped & hurt the film. It also doesn't help that the film just dragged at times & felt longer than it's hour & a half time. The acting in the film is very well done for a film of this nature(the abusive mother giving one of the best performances in the film) & the plot is well done enough, but it just can't save itself from itself.I do recommend watching it, if only for the strangely comedic scene of Yamazaki (the guy selling the hair extensions) dancing around his apartment singing ""Hair, hair"".

Glaser (The Running Man).To this day, when it comes to films about figure skating and capturing the essence of training and competition, the 1992 film ""The Cutting Edge"" is considered by fans of the sport to be one of the better films to showcase the sport.Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (the actor known for his classic role in ""Starsky and Hutch"" and director of episodes of ""Miami Vice"" and Las Vegas and the Arnold Schwarzenegger film ""The Running Man"") and written by Tony Gilroy (The ""Bourne"" trilogy, ""Michael Clayton"", ""Duplicity""), ""The Cutting Edge"" was a cutting edge film at the time.Featuring innovative ways to film figure skating, the film would star D.B. Sweeney (""Spawn"", ""Memphis Belle"", ""Fire in the Sky""), Moira Kelly (""Chaplin"", ""One Tree Hill"", ""The West Wing""), Roy Dotrice (""Amadeus"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"") and Terry O'Quinn (""Lost"", ""The X Files"", ""The Step Father"", ""Primal Fear"").VIDEO:""The Cutting Edge"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  Like many films from the late '80s to early '90s, picture quality for many catalog films on Blu-ray are unfortunately not in the best shape.  ""The Cutting Edge"" shows signs of age and definitely has a strong mixture of grain and noise.Granted, picture quality for the film is more likely better compared to its DVD and VHS counterpart, certain scenes with red and blues actually do pop onscreen due to the sharpness but for the most part, picture quality is good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Cutting Edge"" is presented in English 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Dolby Surround and French Dolby Surround.  The film is a front-channel driven lossless soundtrack.  Dialogue and early '90s music is heard crystal clear.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:The Cutting Edge comes with the following special features:The Cutting Edge: Reflections from the Ice - (10:53)  D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly talk about their experience working and training for ""The Cutting Edge"".Theatrical Trailer - (2:04) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Cutting Edge"".JUDGMENT CALL:Have you ever been on the ice and fall down while skating and someone to yell ""toe pick"".  The now used slang on the ice skating rink is derived from the figure skating film ""The Cutting Edge"".There are not many films based on figure skating and for the films I have reviewed over time, sure there will always be ""Ice Castles"" and ""Love Story"" and I felt that back in the '90s, ""The Cutting Edge"" was a pretty awesome film when it came to how they were able to film ice skating and build contraptions in order to capture the skaters and make it look convincing.But to my surprise, what was more interesting was to know that both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly trained in figure skating to the point where they were able to pull of certain moves on their own and make it look convincing on camera.In fact, for Moira Kelly, she took it seriously and her dedication to learning to figure skate and amaze even the trainers because of her dedication to the training and even learning difficult moves quite quickly  (note: Kelly pushed herself so hard that she even fractured her ankle).  Granted, there are scenes of stand-in doubles for the more difficult moves but there are many scenes where you know that the two talents were actually on the ice and were skating.Also, I felt that both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly did a good job with their role and both had great chemistry.  I enjoyed the ""opposites attract"" storyline but of course, for many people who are dedicated to the sport, the fact that a hockey player became a professional figure skater may seem a bit farfetched but I actually enjoyed the back-and-forth exchanges by both characters and felt that Sweeney and Kelly did a great job with their performance.But what about the story?  Granted, the film is quite predictable and the plot is quite formulaic in structure and yes, there are people who know more about the qualifications of athletes in the Olympics and know that the film doesn't capture the true nature of the sport perfectly.  And I'm sure figure skaters would probably be the first people to be fairly critical of the film but one thing that this film has done is inspire many young people to take up figure skating and even Moira Kelly has mentioned how people continue to recognize her from ""The Cutting Edge"" and thank her for inspiring them to join figure skating.As for the Blu-ray release, unfortunately those who are expecting the film to look pristine on Blu-ray may be disappointed to see that the film looks quite aged and for some, the high amount of grain and noise may not be to their liking.  But that's how a lot of films in the late '80s and '90s look and I would rather have the grain that excessive Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) and make the film look overly soft.  But I will say that the film does look much better than its VHS and DVD counterpart.  And as for special features, it was great to have the one special feature featuring both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly many years later to discuss the popularity and their involvement in the film.Overall, the way I felt back in 1992 about the film has not really decrease much in 2011.  Aside from the 2010 release of ""Ice Castles"" which tried to show modern technology capturing the competitive and technical side of ice skating, ""The Cutting Edge"" is an entertaining film that captures two characters who are from different sports, are different type of people and dislike each other but eventually, their dedication to teamwork leads to an appreciation of each other's skill and eventually making them an awesome team.Sure, it's not perfect, nor is it a great film and nor does it capture the authentic nature of the road to the Olympics but even now, in 2011, I still feel that this is one of the better ice skating films out there.""The Cutting Edge"" is charming, uplifting and entertaining.  It's definitely a romantic comedy that shines through the performance by Moira Kelly who is fantastic in this film.  And I also have to say that the chemistry and tension between her and D.B. Sweeney is quite convincing and fun to watch.  Also, if you ever hear someone yell ""Toe Pick"" when you munch on the ice, now you know what film those words came from.Overall, ""The Cutting Edge"" is recommended for those looking for a ""good"" ice skating film but also an entertaining, romantic comedy.",The Cutting Edge VHS

1178545,"Part of Ghost House Underground collection, Trackman (2007) is a slasher film shot in Russia (CCCP), and dubbed in English.  While the language barrier contributes to the film having poor dialog and kind of a rough edge, the major problem is the uneven pacing, and underdeveloped storyline.  Way too much time is spent establishing a creepy ""atmosphere"", before the level of action finally ramps up in the third act.Trackman starts out with some promise, as a man named Splint recruits three criminal types to carry out his plan to rob a bank.  Unfortunately things do not go as planned, and some soldiers in the bank are killed.  After grabbing some cash, the three bank robbers each grab a hostage, and escape down into a system of underground tunnels.  The plan is for the three robbers, Grom (Dmitri Orlov), Kirk (Oleg Kamenshchikov), and Kostya (Tomas Motkus), to rendezvous with Splint underground, and then make their escape.  Two of the hostages, Olga (Yuliya Mukhailova) and Katya (Svetlana Metkina) are bank employees, and the third is a police sergeant (Aleksandr Vysokovskiy).For about 40 minutes, the film follows the group as they wander noisily through the tunnel system, which lucky for them is fairly well lighted.  Along their journey, there are brief shadowy glimpses of the Trackman, a masked figure with goggles, carrying a pickaxe, reminiscent of the killer in My Bloody Valentine.  When Splint is found dying, with his eyes gouged out, the group realizes that they are not alone.  When a strange mist conveniently appears in the tunnel, it is finally time for the Trackman (Aleksey Dmitriev) to swing his pickaxe.After this, the pace begins to pickup, and the herd is thinned down a bit.  Things get more interesting, when the Trackman sets his sights on Katya, and tries to strangle her long distance using a cord.  Grom manages to save her, and they barely manage to crawl to safety.  Somehow the Trackman remains close behind, and even engages in a little gunplay, before whipping out of all things, his trusty flamethrower!  Grom and Katya battle the Trackman at his hideout, which soon becomes an inferno, bringing this unlikely adventure to a fiery conclusion.Trackman gets off to a decent start, but quickly looses momentum, dragging on for far too long before it finally gets going.  Even after the action ramps up, most of what occurs is pretty ridiculous, such as when Katya shows no damage after hitting her head with a pipe.  Other strange events are not explained, like how does a motorcycle get stuck on the ceiling of the tunnel, and then somehow get back down again?  Still, the action scenes in the final act are decent enough to keep the film from being a complete waste of time.  Trackman is a fairly robotic killer, who doesn't speak.  He usually moves at a snail's pace, but occasionally is capable of bursts of speed.  Character development in general is very shallow, with the dialog mostly consisting of senseless chatter, or people giving commands or making threats.  The tunnel settings are very inconsistent, and the structure varies widely.  About the only constant are the narrow tracks for mining carts, that run through the tunnels.  Walking through the mud, the cast manages to remain remarkably clean.There aren't any spectacular kills, and the characters and killer aren't particularly interesting, so Trackman might be best suited to slasher enthusiasts.  The movie is disjointed, inconsistent, unpolished, and loses something in the translation, but it does have pretty decent production values, and a few scary moments and well shot scenes.",N/A
755561,"Back in the 80s I was a kid. I didn't have movie to spend on all the movies I just wanted to see. I had to save it and spend it on movies I thought would be worth my money. Well I skipped this one as the reviews back then were just horrible. They beat up Madonna and Sean Penn pretty badly back then as I recall. And I would recall very well as I was a HUGE Madonna fan back then. But after all of these years I finally watched it. I don't get what was so wrong. I can remember three of them: 1) The way Madonna read the line ""He's gaining"" 2) The fake way Madonna was ""crying"" after she fell out of the window and 3) the way the guy chasing them ran through all the merchants and people on the street for ""action"" when he could have ran down the empty street itself. The ending had a good twist but was a left one thing loose for me . . . where were the flowers all the time? And what were those jewels? That didn't seem to be explained well. Other than this I liked the movie. It was a Adventure's in Babsitting, Ferris Beuller's Day off, type of movie . . . . Nothing special. Nothing horrible. I think people were hell bent on bringing Madonna under control back then  . . . they couldn't let her get too big  . . . not at least with acting as she had already conquered the music world. . . and for good reason as we found out in the 90s (when I stopped being a fan). It probably deserves two stars. But I am going to give it 3 as I feel misled by all the bad press around it. Also the extra features were just OK. There should have been more . . . deeper . . . more secrets revealed after all of this about a movie that bombed so badly and with such big names attached to it. Were was Madonna, Sean, and George's remarks? And Melissa Rivers??? Shows they just rushed to put something together to make it a ""Special Edition"".

1434461,"This may be the hardest cardio workout video I own. Since what one person's advanced workout is another person's warm-up, I will provide some perspective on my exercise level.  Since a naturally fast metabolism is not in my genes, I work hard to stay in shape because I know I gain weight extremely easily (I lost a lot of weight years ago and I work hard to maintain this).  I run 3-4 times a week, often incorporating sprint and hill runs.  I do an advanced level 1 hr bootcamp class twice a week (pull ups, hill runs, jump-ups, man-makers, etc) and I also do weight training.  I have a resting heart rate in the 40s (bpm).  I think I am pretty good shape.  I think this workout is really hard and effective and a major butt kicker.  This is a cardio junkie's dream workout.This is a high intensity interval training (HIIT) workout based on the tabata protocol, which means you go full intensity cardio for 20 seconds and then rest for 10 seconds.  This is repeated 8 times per exercise interval.  There are eight intervals in this workout.  Between intervals, there is a short recovery period where you are performing a low intensity move while Amy runs through the next series of exercises.  For each interval, there are three levels of intensity (beginner, intermediate, advanced).  There are two other exercisers in addition to Amy who perform either the beginner of the advanced workout.  This workout requires no additional equipment (you use your own body).  Many of the exercises are high impact (with the exception of the beginner's level).  Amy is very personable instructor with a great you-can-do it attitude.A break down of the workout:Approximately 5 minute warm upShe she has you doing side steps as she demonstrates interval one.Interval one, jumping jack series.

367227,"For all types and ages of Elvira fans, Cassandra Peterson's alter ego delivers a 5 star performance in the campy, creepy, cleavage busting story about the 'real' Elvira, who upon resigning from her infamous red sofa studio, demanding respect, and getting none, she wallows away in her dressing room, until receiving a telegram, stating her Great Aunt, Morgana Talbot, from Falwell, Massachusetts has passed on, and she is to appear for the reading of the will, as she is 'kin', she has a stake in the inheiratence.Upon arriving in Falwell, in a decked out, black convertible, complete with barb wire wrapped around the rear view mirror, skulls lining the body of the car, an inverted pentagram inside the steering wheel, leapord print interior, with a license plate reading ""KICK ASS"", the Falwell residents are less then welcoming, to say the least, as the town is about as big as a zip code, and as conservative as the namesake. With a supurb storline, and plot, we get a sneak peak into Elvira's offscreen antics, and along with the one liners, wisecracks, and abundant sexual inuendos, and double entendres, the film, first out in theaters in '88 (which I watched, and LOVED), the DVD has some bonus featurettes as well as the classic movie itself.

Julie Taymor's creative interpretation is absolutely stunning.  I still prefer to hear ""Magic Flute"" in the original German; but many are turned off by not being able to understand without reading the sub-titles.  Nathan Gunn (Papageno) is a delight in one of my favorite operatic characters.  Erika Miklosa (the Queen of the Night) is superb, particularly her appearances at the inventive hands of Taymor.  Pape, Huang and Polenzani are all excellent as they transform one from a sterile Vienese Masonic setting into an atmosphere somewhere west of Tokyo.  Thank God Monostatos is not depicted as black.

893122,"Made in 1966, this is the first and only film featuring Shakespeare's character, Falstaff. It is a joyful comedy with selected scenes from the History plays (Richard II, Henry IV Books 1 and 2, and Henry V). In a trio of Shakespeare films including Macbeth and Othello, it was directed by, and starring Orson Welles, and remains a masterpiece of its day.The film is fun throughout. Most of the comedy is low life, with vagabonds, thieves and cutpurses living in `dens of iniquity'. Falstaff enjoys `sac' and lives life to the full, every day. However, there are also moments of drama and pathos, such as Henry Vs rejection of Falstaff during his coronation, and the lamentations after the old man's death.Whilst Welles is the best Falstaff I have seen in a large screen film, there have been some great portrayals since then in Shakespeare's original play formats. The rest of the cast is also good, including Margaret Rutherford, a classical actress who never failed to please, as a superb Mistress Quickly. Keith Baxter also stands out as Young Hal, then as Henry V, and is convincing in both lifestyles. In particular I like John Gielgud in the very difficult role of Henry IV who speaks with such excellence and eloquence. Unfortunately we only see little of him which is a shame as he would have brought more class to the film.As with other black and white films over 45 years old, we must make allowances for sub standard picture and sound quality, as well as poor props and scenery, caused by low budget difficulties. If and when the viewer forgives these limitations, it is a great film and a true Orson Welles classic. I yearn for a remake, but is there another Welles or Gielgud anywhere?",N/A

I'd love to see the lost footage, but as far I as recall the missing 20-some mins. were lost for years. The footage resurfaced some time ago without an audio track. Even without the missing parts, this is a fine example of early 70s supernatural thrillers. It stands toe to toe with the finest from Hammer or Amicus from the same period, or the DC line of horror comic books.However, it disappoints many fans because all of the TV show cast do not appear. The cast in the film is wonderful. And it's great to see Grayson Hall as yet another character! The smaller cast makes this film tighter and more accessible to the new-comers and fans alike.Honestly I think this film is the superior of the 2 Dark Shadows movies, but you're not going to find the continuation of the TV series (Barnabas' story is resolved at the end of the TV series), or even the first movie. It's a completely new tale featuring the witch, Angelique, Quintin Collins and his wife Daphne. But no Barnabas and no vampires. I'd love to see the movie and House of Dark Shadows on DVD!

It was on this second watching that I realized the true beauthy of this film.I'm Not There is a film about Bob Dylan as Apocalypse Now! is a film about Vietnam. Both films captured the truly surrealistic essence of their substance. The latter captured the surreal lunacy of the Vietnan War while the latter captured the surreal chameleon we know as Dod Dylan. The director was right on point in having different actors portray Dylan at the different phases of his life. THere is some poetic justice at having an Afro-American portray Dylan as a child. Both must have been and felt similarly dispossessed.  There is a similar appropriateness of having Kate Blanchet portray the 1966 Dylan. The ""real"" Dylan was certainly a waif-like shell of a person, exhausted and spent from years of demands from his fans of what they thought he was and what they thought he represented. Dylan was simply Dylan,unable to articulate the reasons behind his persona because he simply experienced and followed his muse, not asking the reasons why he was the mouthpiece for that muse.The movie also accurately portrayed the 60s in general, when the clash of cultures first manifested and reared its ugly head. Those were surrealistic times as well.It will take a number of years before the film receives wide acceptance and not be relegated to a cult film.",N/A

Eventually, though, the film started to grow on me. To me, it's not only a film about the notions of coincidence versus destiny, but about the effects of past sins on a future generation, and about the choices each of us makes in our lives. Again, it's a powerful portrayal, yet it paints a fascinating and compelling picture of peoples' rises and falls, redemption, despair, and the Biblical-related theme of intersection.

I initially gave it a 4/5 and found it interesting, but it's growing on me and is now a 4.5/5.The story is bleak, but very realistic, which isn't surprising considering that it's semi-autobiographical. Truffaut's early life must have been hard. His parents tried at times, but treated him badly or with indifference at other times.Much of the early part of the film is set in a classroom and we meet his classmates and learn his general attitude toward school. The discipline was very different than what we might expect today. He has one particular friend who encourages him to skip class and we see their shared experiences on the streets of Paris.The friend is partly responsible for leading him astray and encouraging him to steal which leads into the second part of the story where we see the consequences of his bad behavior and his lies.Some of the school scenes remind me of my childhood, although I had a much happier upbringing.The main thing that brings Antoine happiness is cinema and the happiest time spent with his parents involves a trip to see a film.The film also provides a snapshot of Paris in the late 50s. Shot in black and white and told from Antoine's viewpoint, we often see exactly what he sees through the choice of camera angles. His perspective also shows us that he thinks of himself in very different ways from the way in which he is viewed by others.

1121912,This is a great video that clarifies the role of Charlie Wilson and the years of combat between the Afghan people and the Soviets.  The repurcussions of that still reverberates in that part of the world.  Wilson was a maverick and championed the downtrodden but the US failed to follow up with aid to that part of the world once the Soviets left although Wilson attempted to orient congress in that direction.  Another case of too little and too late and soon we were involved in that area ourselves as a nation.  Truly a case of irony in action.,The True Story of Charlie Wilson

1414455,"Wow, this film was great.  It scared the mess outa me. I LOVED IT!!! I could have sworn that I had already reviewed this film. Oh,well...NE-Wayz, This film is about a sweet American Family with three children -two boys and a baby girl. Everything seems perfect about this family, mom works from home as a song writer, dads wears a suit and works outside the home and all is well in Mayberry. Then the sounds begin. Voices on the babymoniter, doorbells and banging and why is this happening? I dont want to spoil it but this movie is awsome.  One reviewer says this movie works well in the movie theater setting and I would have to agree with that person.  The bangs and the thumps and the hissing and yelling really have an effect with the theater sound system.  My favorite scene in the movie is when the mom is taking out the garbage and the song on the record player changes. Mom walks up to the house and peeks in the window to see... OMG!! You have to see this movie.  Some people didnt like the ""Ghostbusters"" but I loved them. They got a little corny, but overall I thought they were a neccessary comic relief (RELIEF being the operative word) this movie gets to the point where it is too scary and we just need a break. The ending picks it up again and I look forward to the sequal... A GOOD SEQUAL por favor.",Insidious
1377976,"""This will be a day long remembered."" This quote from the first Star Wars film, known since 1981 as ""Episode &#8547;: A New Hope,"" describes the feelings of myself, and countless other Star Wars fans on the eagerly awaited Blu-ray release of the Star Wars saga.  I just received mine about two hours ago as of this writing.  But with every new release of Star Wars comes a looming question: What will George Lucas change this time?This was not always the case.  Fifteen years of home video releases saw the trilogy presented exactly as they were seen in theaters (albeit usually in panned and scanned versions formatted to fit a standard television screen), and with the release of 1993's THX edition release (available in widescreen for the first time on VHS), it seemed the movies would never be better than they were.The work Industrial Light & Magic did for Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park changed all that.  Lucas admitted that he was never happy with the way Star Wars came out, due mostly to restraints of time, money, and ILM's pioneering, yet crude technology, and announced that with current computer graphics, he could finally go back and complete scenes from the original trilogy that had bugged him for years.1997 saw the release of the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition, a theatrical (and eventually home video) re-release of all three films with newly enhanced special effects, and a handful of additional scenes.  To say the reaction was mixed would be an understatement.  Nearly a decade-and-a-half after they were revealed to the world, many of the changes Lucas made have been heavily criticized and hotly debated.  Those who grew up on the originals felt that the new additions ruined the movies.  Disappointed fans took solace in the fact that at least they could still watch the original versions of the films at home on VHS.Seven years later saw the DVD release of the ""Original Trilogy"" as it was now known, following two prequels, with one last film on the way.  Fans pleaded and prayed that Lucas would see fit to release the theatrical versions alongside the Special Editions, which were now said to have even more changes to better tie in the Originals with the Prequels.  Not only did they not get their wish (at least not until a few years later), but many fans scoffed at some of the newest changes made to the series, believing the prequels to be further ruining the series, and any changes made to accommodate those films would be even more detrimental to the dignity of the Original Trilogy.So here we are today.  I have my Star Wars Blu-rays laying on my sofa, awaiting their weekend marathon.  I have heard rumors of even more changes to Episodes &#8547; through &#8549;, as well as a few for &#8544; through &#8546;.  These rumors include deleted scenes incorporated into the films, a new CG Yoda to replace the puppet (I knew they were doing this for Episode &#8544;, though I'm still unsure about whether this plan also includes Episodes &#8548; and &#8549;), and the possibility of Han once again shooting first.  I will thank anyone who has knowledge of exactly what changes have been made to keep quiet.  I want to be surprised.The thing is, after all these years of changes and complaints, I still don't see what the big deal is.  There are very few changes to the Original Trilogy to which I strongly object, and none of those changes affect the over-all film in any way.  What difference does it make whether Han or Greedo shoots first?  As long as Greedo misses, the other approximately 13 hours, 20 minutes, and 59 seconds of the saga remains roughly the same.  Sure, the Jabba the Hutt scene in A New Hope seems redundant and unnecessary in terms of the single film, and maybe it ruins the ""big reveal"" of Jabba in Return of the Jedi, but since Jabba already appears in The Phantom Menace (canonically the first film in the saga), and that scene was always supposed to be in A New Hope in the first place, it hardly ruins anything.  I will agree, Jedi Rocks sucks, Lapti Nek is better, but since it is only a nonsensical musical number with no relation to the plot, whichever song they use is more personal preference than pertinence.  Speaking of music, I also prefer the instrumental music and galactic celebrations used at the end of Jedi now to the ""Yub Nub"" teddy bear picnic from the original.  And as for replacing Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen... it could have been done better, but again, it's only a few seconds of footage, and for the new generation of Star Wars fans who have grown up with the prequels, it does help tie the whole story together.I have yet to even look at the Blu-rays (as of this writing), and I will not see anything from Episodes &#8547; through &#8549; until Sunday, but when I do I will reserve judgement, and determine for myself if anything ""ruins"" Star Wars.  I doubt anything will.  I might not agree with some of Lucas' decisions, but when it comes right down to it, they're not my -- nor anyone else's -- movies, but his.  I challenge anyone who says that they could make a better movie than George Lucas to do so.  Making fan edits and indie movies based on the Original Trilogy do not count as creativity.  They are just stealing a brilliant idea from a more successful person and modifying it to fit someone else's tastes.  The original movies were not perfect -- they have always had flaws -- but if the man who created them feels that the current versions are the best versions, that is his prerogative as their creator.  If you don't like them, create your own multi-billion dollar franchise, and make them your way.  These are his movies, and as long as they are his, they are mine too.  Besides, they are only movies...UPDATE: I have just now finished watching all six movies and I can now confirm that more than ninety-nine percent of the saga appears on Blu-ray exactly as it appeared in theaters (Episodes &#8545; and &#8546; are, as far as I could tell, identical), with most of the alterations being to Episodes &#8547;-&#8549; , which are still nearly ninety-nine percent the same as their theatrical versions.How do I come to this conclusion?  Simple arithmetic.  The combined total runtime of the entire saga is 805 minutes, 418 for the Prequels, 387 for the Original Trilogy.  The only noticeable changes to the prequels were the aforementioned CG Yoda, and a brief fly-through of Coruscant, both in Episode &#8544; (the fly-through was included on previous home video versions).  By my rough estimate, there are approximately 4-5 minutes of significant new footage to Episodes &#8547;-&#8549; combined: about one minute each for the Jabba scene and Jedi Rocks, about 30 seconds each for Mos Eisley and the Victory Celebration, and about a minute or two of scattered CG enhancements like the animated Dewbacks, Rebel fly-by, Cloud City expansions, Sarlacc, etc.  (The infamous ""Greedo shoots first"" shot is literally eight frames -- or one-third of a second -- long, in which Greedo fires an imperceptible two frames before Han.  I counted.)  Figuring conservatively that's approximately 98.7% of the Original Trilogy's footage left intact, all of which is story and character-based, meaning nothing even remotely alters the original plot.I has been over a year since I've looked at the hours of deleted scenes and special features -- I forgot to update at the time -- but from what I recall, most of the were pretty interesting.  The most exciting ones were the deleted scenes from Episodes &#8547;-&#8549;.  I also liked the features on the building of the various models, including the Death Star &#8545; and the Super Star Destroyer.  The Prequels' features were a little less interesting.  Most of the best stuff was already included on the DVDs, and unfortunately, as far as I could tell, none of the were carried over to the Blu-ray, including, sadly, the deleted scenes.  It would have been nice to have had the option to watch to Prequels in extended branching versions, since most of the deleted scenes were mostly completed for the DVD release, and would have served the subplots of the trilogy, but the only deleted scenes we get here are incomplete, pointless, and in some cases, only animatics.",Star Wars: The Complete Saga - Episodes I-VI

54963,"The Deer Hunter is as much a traditional war film as Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a comedy. Each category fits the respectable film, but their true intentions spread beyond these categories. As much as Dr. Strangelove was a political film, The Deer Hunter is a psychological study of the torments of war.The Deer hunter is concerned with a couple of friends living in Pennsylvania, and their daily exploits. Young men as they are, there is constantly a clash of emotions between them. The film wants to vividly display these emotions by showing one of the friend's wedding, Stephen and his bride-Angela. The scene which possibly lasts for more than half an hour attempts to do nothing but highlight their personality and sheer innocence. Three of these men, Niki, Stephen, and Michael, who are to venture to Vietnam for military duty, have a few precious days for reflection before their lives will be changed forever. After the first act, which introduces the characters and their lives, the second part focuses on the war, or rather the frustration of facing death in a ""game"" of Russian roulette ""hosted"" by the enemy. This game, in a nutshell, is the central element of the film that displays the agony of the war in a small setting. Every trigger could mean death or momentarily holding on to life. This symbol is brilliantly used, making the audience ask itself is the winner of Russian roulette, the winner, or is he the true victim of the psychological elements of the game; or, in a larger scale, the survivor of war may have won the battle, or conquered the hardships, but it seems that he lost the game of life, for he has lost his control, sanity, and livelihood. If these are the conditions for all veterans of war, is not death a better option?After the second act, the third part focuses on the psychological study of the three friends that attended and survived the war. The film asks us to consider how war can change a person, and even if a person retains his personality after war? Everyone is so damaged, physically and mentally, that not only is their innocence shattered, but even their soul has been robbed by this war. Michael, played by Robert De Niro, who enjoyed deer hunting before the war, now doesn't have the heart to shoot a deer. These men are prisoners of war, even though they are not in prison. War has encompassed their life, that their very actions, thoughts, emotions, have been modified by the war. The distance they keep from their loved ones, distaste from firearms, and altered memory of events and people is due to the very effects of war that has made Niki, Michael, and Stephen the anthises of their previous selves.The film's unexpected ending solidifies it as a tragic, and at times tearful, experience, rather than a mere display of military potential. At the beginning, we are at loss in the significance of the overlong wedding sequence, or the seemingly unnecessary conflict between Michael and Stanley, played by John Cazale. There seems to be a lot of fluff, but as the intent of the film sets in, it becomes clear that Michael Cimino wants to display the humanity of the characters before sending them to the most severely harmful place on the planet. In many war films, the audience becomes familiar with the characters on the battlefield; in a condition, that the human being is being tested emotionally, physically, and mentally. In such conditions, we do not really know the human being, but, rather know the distraught mess of a person. The portrait of men before war is pivotal to understanding the effects of war; in other words, the conditions of the man of war can be tested by his life before his engagement in war. Unfortunately, the film does not warn the audience of its psychological study, so for much of the film we are at a loss in how to approach the work. It does not hint that this is not a traditional war film, but rather an observation of the post-conditions of men of war. In this respect, the audience has to remodify its approach to the film to actually understand it from the specific angel it wishes to approach. If not, The Deer Hunter will seem nothing more than an overlong patch-like study of sections of a couple of men's lives, without each part being detailed or entertaining as a whole.The film is a solemn, unexciting, slow-moving, character building experience which aims not at humanizing its characters, because they don't need the help. Its purest intentions are to display the cruelty of war on the human psyche, while cleverly lambasting the unnecessary Vietnam War. The film has long been criticized for its supposed liberal standpoint, but such a title would be best left for films such as Oliver Stone's Platoon. The Deer Hunter far extends the Vietnam War and warns of the effects of all wars, short or long in length, on the warrior. At the beginning of the film, in the wedding ceremony, there is a poster wishing luck to the soldiers that will serve this land in the name of God. The final scene of the film also harbors the same patriotism by the cast's singing of ""God Bless America"" which sounds, as unfortunate as it may be, mockingly funny, for it was the patriotism that got them in all the trouble that they find themselves in. Or, maybe it was a work of reverse psychology telling us that as wise as humanity is, war will always be an integral part of his life; maybe he just isn't wise enough to realize the harmful cultural ideas that have made him proud of his war service.",N/A

Some of the characters didn't age sequentially to each other and the wig poor Matthew Macfadyen had to wear at the end was just awful! If you freeze frame at the end there is one part where you can see his hair under the bad rug. All in all not a bad film, I am not sure who to blame for the low quality ending. The director, the lack of budget or if the series was low in popularity and stars cut their budget. The overall history of the time period is very interesting to me and the majority of the events were based on fact though some of their depictions I found humorous for the unintended purpose.

601398,"One of those films that left me scratching my head, `The Truth About Charlie' isn't so much confusing as it is bewilderingly dull.  The film fails to do much of anything.  It isn't fun, it isn't sexy, it isn't witty, it isn't charming...it just isn't.  The action is problematic in that it doesn't do anything we haven't already seen countless times before, and the chemistry between the two stars is borderline non-existent.  I haven't seen the original yet (although I will one day, considering my Hepburn adoration) and so I cannot compare, but I hope it has more substance and style than this one.  The plot just hangs there here, and the way it is strung along doesn't draw the audience in.  I expected more from Demme, who has proven himself a capable director...and then again, he has also proven himself inconsistent.  This is probably the worst thing he's ever done, and when you consider that it's one of the worst films of the past decade then it really says a lot for Demme's taste level.

314592,"Back then, The Ed Sullivan Show was one of the biggest things ever on television, and for a good reason, because it's where many of the most famous performers in the world have appeared. Also, Ed Sullivan made sure that they would be granted an access on his show because he knew they would be big before they got big. Most importantly, Ed Sullivan was truly the Master of Ceremonies, long before there were Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, and others. Two of the most important moments in television history occurred on The Ed Sullivan Show were the introduction of Elvis Presley (which was ""viewed by a record 60 million people which at the time was 82.6 percent of the television audience, and the largest single audience in television history"") and the Beatles to Americans. Another unique aspect of his show was the zero discrimination given to black performers and performers of different stages including ballet, opera, theatrical plays, vaudeville, puppet shows, etc. That's what made Ed Sullivan a huge humanitarian and possibly the most important of the show business. Of course, Ed Sullivan was not without controversies, many of them famous and well-known. He was a strict disciplinarian, having a say-so on what can happen and not on his show. Regardless, he did more for many than not. Looking at the Vol. One of VHS tape, although it has the moments taped, it also had a lot of bland, outdated, or corny stuff. Sometimes, there were a few who were overdid once too many times (perhaps favoritism?).

390889,"What a totally depressing representation of marriage. I have never read the book and did not know what to expect, but the movie sounded interesting, as I find period pieces enjoyable. The first couple of hours were not terrible and actually drew me in, but then the main characters got married and everything went downhill quick! Marriage, as protrayed in this movie, is a horrible, dreadful thing where the men never stop their side affairs and the wives are forced to find lovers. One man tells his wife, on their wedding day, mind you, he only married her for her money. The other is a homosexual, who we discreetly find out about when the horse groomer gives him a flirty wink, and then we find out in whole, when they are discovered wrapped in each others arms, sleeping in bed (with smiles on their faces). Nan is the unfortunate married to this fellow. But what is quite hard to understand is why Julius (her husband) pursued her so ardently in the first place if his feelings are for men. Second, is why Nan had such fun with Julius before she married him, and then when he wants to sleep with her, she shrieks and crys. What happened to change her feelings? No explanation. She goes completely cold on him after that and seeks out the man she would have married if he hadn't left for a job in a faraway country, but now has returned. The few characters in this movie who seem to think marriage is for life, and that if both husband and wife would put aside selfishness and try to please the other - a good marriage is possible, are made to look loony. Basically this is a movie that shouts if you're not happy, find a way to make it happen. The whole second half of the film was like a bad soap opera and for this reason, I'd say skip this movie if you put any value in marriage.",The Buccaneers VHS

OK, fine, but why let the criminals run all over the ship?  And one of them strangles several sailors and is not even locked up!  There's a bit of romance with Bob and another woman but overall it's a silly story with bad editing and hard to follow what's going on.""The Death Kiss"" has several favorite horror actors that made the film enjoyable.  Edward Van Sloan and Bela Lugosi, both of ""Dracula"" fame reunite in a murder mystery on the lot of a major Hollywood studio.  The inferences and criticisms of the studio system of the time, with arrogant producers and directors is entertaining.  The viewer is led through the plot and just when you think you got it figured out the twist ending makes you go ""Oh!""  Lugosi does not play a large role, that being of the amateur sleuth Franklyn, played by David Manners.  The comic relief by the studio guard is forced and silly, otherwise the film is not bad at all.""Bluebeard"" with John Carradine is unintentionally funny and at times hard to follow, as a serial killer is on the streets of 19th century Paris, where no one has a French accent and people try to kill you with their sarcasm.Features & Bottom Line:There are no features, nary a trailer!  All black & white at various degrees of clarity, all remastered by Echo Bridge Entertainment.  ""The Death Kiss"" and ""Dressed to Kill"" make this DVD a worthy purchase, but if you could get them separately with features then go for it.",Mystery Classics

1324315,"""The Social Network"" captures the zeitgeist of the moment better than any movie of recent times.This Aaron Sorkin adaptation of the Ben Mezrich nonfiction novel, ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" purports to tell the story of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, who rose from simple Harvard student to become the youngest billionaire in the world. I say ""purports"" because clearly the movie takes certain liberties with many of the facts of the story (most egregiously, perhaps, the fact that Zuckerberg actually had a girlfriend during the time depicted here) and, thus, the movie isn't really all that valuable as a documentary account of the way things actually went down. What the movie does do incredibly well is to capture the mood of an era and to tell a compelling story for our times.One of ""The Social Network's"" greatest strengths is its willingness to feature a protagonist who is not all that easy to like. As portrayed in the film, Zuckerberg is a brilliant, amoral, petulant, socially inept, overcompensating nerd who doesn't really care who he hurts on his way to the top. Yet, oddly, Zuckerberg seems to have no real yen for fame and fortune; indeed his initial impetus for creating Facebook seems to arise as much out of a desire to get back at his girlfriend for breaking up with him as to become rich and famous (those being mere ancillary benefits). Zuckerberg also spends much of his time trying to backstab those around him, including his best friend and roommate, Eduardo Severin, who is the initial source of funding for the project and who becomes the tale's ethical counterweight to the morally bankrupt Zuckerberg. But Zuckerberg is also eventually sued by the Winklevoss brothers, some fellow Harvard students, for allegedly appropriating their initial social-networking idea and making it his own.  Zuckerberg's motive for being a first-class jerk seems to be jealousy born out of his inability to fit in with the ""jock"" class at the school. Yet, every attempt he makes at ingratiating himself with others - particularly women - only serves to reinforce the sociopathic nature of his personality.Yet, there's something about Zuckerberg that keeps him from becoming entirely loathsome and that actually makes us identify with him to some extent.  Perhaps, it's that very awkwardness - that inability to master or even understand the social codes by which relationships work - that makes Zuckerberg a more sympathetic figure than he perhaps deserves to be. As one of the characters late in the film says in assessing his character, ""You're not an a-hole, Mark; you're just trying so hard to be."" Or perhaps it's the subtlety and depth that Jesse Eisenberg brings to the role that results in that effect.""The Social Network"" is like a fine Greek tragedy being played out in modern dress, except that Zuckerberg's ""fall"" occurs mainly in the realm of human relationships and fineness of character and not of fame, fortune or status (since Zuckerberg still seems to have all three still pretty much intact at this point). When, at the end, the creator of Facebook sits all alone at a laptop, having lost the one person who was ever really a true friend to him, and meekly asks permission to use the law office's computer, we see the tragic emptiness of a man who's sold his soul to the devil - if, indeed, he had a soul to sell in the first place.  It is that ambiguity that lifts ""The Social Network"" above the traditional morality play and makes it speak directly to our time.There is literally not a single performance - whether major or minor - in this film that is less than outstanding. In addition to Eisenberg, there is tremendous work from Andrew Garfield as Eduardo; the perpetually underrated Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, the crassly manipulative creator of Napster; and Armie Hammer as the Harvard rowing twins (lots of CGI here) who fall victim to Zuckerberg's conniving - and become surprisingly sympathetic figures as a result. There are also fine performances from Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation"") and David Selby (Quentin Collins from ""Dark Shadows"" for the really old-timers in the audience), among many others.As director, David Fincher keeps the movie racing along at a breakneck pace while maintaining a complex balance between flashbacks and flash forwards that at no time become confusing for the audience.  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have also composed a simple but haunting piano score that nicely underlines the seriousness of the piece. Fincher and Sorkin make every moment count, and the final confrontation between Zuckerberg and Eduardo - in which years of unspoken resentments suddenly erupt to the surface - is the most dramatically explosive scene I've seen in ages.For all its topicality and relevance, ""The Social Network"" definitely seems more attuned to the down side of modern technology than the upside (see the recent populist uprisings in Egypt), highlighting how obsessive social networking can lead people to behave in ways that tear at the very fabric that holds society together.  After all, in the old days, one could vent one's grievances against others in private and be done with it.  Now, with the ability to do near-constant blogging, our hurtful words, petty tantrums and malicious actions can go out to a mass audience, ruin other people's reputations, then come back and bite us big time in the end.  That's the lesson Zuckerberg is forced to learn all throughout the movie - and it is one we would all be wise to heed.",N/A
1123692,"South Radio Church (A.K.A. Southwest Radio Ministries) is the oldest, longest running Christian radio ministry in the United States.  Dr. E. F. Webber pioneered a radio station in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1933, and after his passing in 1959, Rev. Noah W. Hutchings took the regional ministry to becoming international.  Rev. Hutchings has authored over 100 books, led numerous tours and missions to the Far East, Asia, China, Mongolia, Russia, Europe, Central America, and Cuba, as well as 50 tours to Israel and the Middle East.This video is part of Rev. Hutchings' legacy, and he appears on this DVD as he shares some of the significance of the city of Petra.  The ancient ruins date back approximately 5,000 years to Esau (Jacob and Esau of the Bible story in Genesis; or also referenced by the Talmud), who is held by most scholars and researchers to have built the city of Petra; otherwise known is a major city of the Edomite people.What I was hoping for from this video was a visual tour in, around, and through the caves and structures known as the ancient city of Petra.  This was made popular by the 1989 Steven Spielberg movie ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" with Denholm Elliott, Sean Connery and Harrison Ford; who search for the Holy Grail and ultimately end up at the city of Petra.  Poetic license heavily exploited by Hollywood (as it usually is), I was fairly certain the city of Petra has no such extravagant enormous cavern as depicted in the Indiana Jones film, but I wanted some authoritative video footage of the city of Petra so I can see just what is there.  The city of Petra being as old as it is, it doesn't take much imagination to see it as a significant city of history, and buying this DVD ""Petra; Prophecy Revealed"" is rumored to be the most informative single resource for those who want to see the city of Petra, but due to health or financial restrictions cannot otherwise tour that ancient location.The video footage of this ancient place is said to be the best available on one DVD, and although I can't say I am thoroughly convinced this is the best DVD for touring the city of Petra, it does have more information than any other resource I have engaged in my quest for learning.  Most people aren't interested in somebody else's interpretation of the Bible prophecies about the ""end times"" (eschatology) and will have a tough time listening to the narration (by Rev. Hutchings and Ken Klein) because if the Bible was a simple, easy to read and understandable book, the United States wouldn't have over 600 formally recognized, licensed denominations of religion.  The DVD should be a little clearer that this is intended primarily to be convincing as a religious study of Bible prophecy more than it is a video footage tour of the ancient city of Petra, although it still rates IMHO as a professionally done 60 minute film that will tell you about and show you video footage of Petra.",N/A
1068771,"As the three stars indicate, I'm not asking how any show could possibly be any better than ""Space 1999.""  What I'm asking, kind of desperately, is: does the show itself get any better than where I stopped watching it?  That would be not quite halfway through the first season.  I simply couldn't watch any more episodes; it was too boring.  Which is unfortunate, because it's apparent from the episodes I did watch that the scripts were first rate science fiction - anything but the standard cookie cutter sci fi scripts which tend to occasionally infect even first rate productions (like Stargate and Star Trek).  I love offbeat sci fi shows like ""Starhunter,"" ""Firefly,"" ""Earth2,"" and the truly great British sci fi show ""Timeslip.""  In other words, this show should have grabbed me hook, line and sinker; but it didn't, so I have to assume it was the production values and not the stories that reduced the episodes to little more than a yawn. So I ask in all sincerity: did the producers pick up on the fact that the show was putting everyone to sleep and rev it up a bit as it went on?  Because I can't imagine anyone watching this for five seasons.  Now I'm a fan of Martin Landau, and Barbara Bain's ok, and Barry Morse is a terrific actor.  Maybe they just need to change roles with one another and it'll all be right?  Is that what happens?  After all, it is sci fi - so they could have a complete character swap without being too off the wall.  Couldn't hurt.",N/A

6211,"It's worth it to see this movie if only for the happy abandonment and heart-pounding anticipation of the bath scene that kick-starts the action of the story.  Picnicking on a Tuscan hillside, the ladies and gentlemen residents of Leonato's villa espy Prince Don Pedro and his men from afar, galloping at a great pace, returning from the wars.  The villa-folk all rise up and run to the house, clambering up the steps to the baths, throwing off their clothes on the way.  Meanwhile, Don Pedro and his men jump down from their horses beside a public fountain and, throwing off their clothes, leap into the waters!  There's a great tumult of music, laughter, and shrieking going on as everybody gets clean and comes up reclothed and fresh to meet the approaching others.  Then, the ladies and men and the newly arrived Prince's company face one another in greeting.  The romances begin to manifest, the revels commence, and marriage is assayed by one couple and avoided by another.The theme song that is carefully spelled out at the beginning of the movie will be repeated twice in increasingly fulsome renditions, the final one at the joyous double-wedding dance that circles gloriously about the be-flowered spring world of the villa.  The song is chiefly about the inconstancy of men, and advises women to adopt a carefree spirit:  ""Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,/Men were deceivers ever,/One foot in sea and one on shore,/To one thing constant never:/Then sigh not so, but let them go,/And be you blithe and bonny,/Converting all your sounds of woe/Into Hey nonny, nonny....""Actually, the plot turns upon a case of inconstancy in woman when, at her wedding, Hero is angrily spurned by Claudio who thinks he has seen proof of her wantonness and false virginity.  The scene creates a most frightening sense of righteous outrage against a shameless violation of chastity that has seemingly taken place.Beatrice and Benedick profess to detest one another and both eschew the married estate.  They keep up a running battle of sparring words, are very similar to Shakespeare's shrewish Kate and her foil Petruchio.  Beatrice, however, seems to be destined for an eventual fair fate when she reports ""A star danced and under that was I born....""  Don Pedro and other friends make up a scheme by which they manage to trick Beatrice and Benedick into falling in love with one another.  ""What fire is in my ears?"" asks Beatrice when she overhears the news that Benedick loves her.  ""The world must be peopled!"" declares Benedick when he overhears the news that Beatrice loves him.The actors are excellently expressive and natural.  They articulate very clearly so that Shakespeare's wit and clever language throughout are readily accessible to the viewer.  Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh are extra delightful in their roles.There are countless instances of marvelous Shakespearean wit:  As in Benedick's comment about a guitar-accompanied rendition of the ""Nonny, Nonny"" song where he says, ""Now, divine air! .... Is it not strange that sheep's guts should hale souls out of men's bodies?""As when Don Pedro describes Benedick:  ""....he is all mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks.""As when giving a description of Beatrice's talk Benedick says: ""She speaks poniards and every word stabs.""  Or, ""Oh God, sir.  Here's a dish I love not.  I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.""As when Don Pedro scolds Beatrice: ""Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Senor Benedick.""  Beatrice replies, ""Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him double use for it, a double heart for his single one: marry, once before he won it of me of false dice, therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.""  Don Pedro says, ""You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.""  Beatrice replies, ""So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools.""Or as when Leonatus speaks of the sort of marriage relationship that bickering Beatrice and Benedick would have: ""Oh Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.""We see that Beatrice can speak sweet compliments, though.  When the Prince asks if she would consider marrying him, she replies, ""No, my lord, unless I might have another for working-days: your grace is too costly to wear everyday.""This is one of the merriest, wittiest, and downright funniest movies ever in MY book!",N/A
1302150,"The era of the looney is over - Pixar made sure of this.  As much as I love them, the studio behind that little lamp has, for better or for worse, turned the concept of cartoons on its head since their arrival.  Ultimately, it was a successful evolution, but not without its share of unfortunate sacrifices.Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud are aware of this and, perhaps with an air of contempt for their admittedly ingenious superiors, have attempted to incorporate the best of both worlds.  Despicable Me is the result of the experiment, and I am so relieved to say that it is a successful one.  A true labor of love, Renaud and Coffin's baby feels immediately retro in the best of ways, while still maintaining a commitment to the thematic elements that adults will appreciate.  That said, this is a goofy movie, plain and simple, and it's all the better for it.It's easy to take the concept for granted:  Two villains struggling for relevance.  Don't be so quick to write it off, for it is nothing if not purely original, even though the idea has likely been skirted around in the past.  Clearly paying homage to the now barren wasteland that was once the world of the Looney Toons, Despicable Me is, perhaps, the greatest animated film of the last five years that strictly finds its charm in stark exaggerations.  That's, admittedly, a bit of an obscure thing to wrap your head around, but it will come together while you're watching - and you do owe it to yourself to see this movie, if only to witness one of the most adorable trios of children yet seen in cinema.Renaud and Coffin put together an odd horde of diverse and talented performers for their voice cast; between Wiig, Arnett, McBride, Andrews, Segel, and two almost unrecognizable accents in both Brand and Carell, it's a funky party, to be sure.  Carell's interpretation of just who Gru is (a strictly european, self conscious man of a watered-down kind of evil) certainly finds its footing early on, making for a bit of humor simply from listening to him speak for an extended period of time.Brand continues to strengthen his track record with a decidedly awesome take on the haggard Dr. Nefario, a veteran villain past his prime and doing everything he can from keeping Gru in his own.  The kids are the real crowd pleasers, letting us all know that Pixar doesn't have a monopoly on the cute factor in animation, let alone the animation genre itself.Despicable Me is a movie that transcends any issues that may come with what could have become a gimmick in the wrong hands.  In the wake of Toy Story 3 and the terrific How to Train Your Dragon, Renaud and Coffin's film likely wont be remembered a year from now.  However, that doesn't prevent it from being a great stopgap in a pretty cramped summer.",N/A
431273,"KRONOS: RAVAGER OF PLANETS is one of that wonderful genre of 1 1/2 star movies that somehow manage to be far better than they should. Filmed in 1957 and starring the Mexican Air Force in a supporting role, KRONOS concerns the depredations of an eponymous giant cube-shaped metallic robot that travels throughout the galaxy seeking host planets (such as Earth) which it can drain dry of energy. It even absorbs a full atomic blast with barely a burp.Conceptually speaking, this is one of the most original ""Radiation is Coming to Get Us"" monsters, well worth watching. The low-budget special effects don't do KRONOS real justice, and the storyline meanders a bit, which makes it only a Four Star One-and-a-Half Star film.Fans of the original STAR TREK might recognize that the plot of KRONOS was lifted for the episode THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE.",Kronos VHS
1324940,"The first Iron Man movie set the bar so high. It's difficult to view another Marvel character movie without comparing it.I think I'm going to place Thor just above The Incredible Hulk in terms of enjoyment. From top to bottom (so far) they rank: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Incredible Hulk. (I don't count the X-Men movies or Spider-Man as they were made by Fox & Sony)Thor stars Chris Helmsworth (Captain Kirk's father from Star Trek) as the arrogant god who is exiled to earth where he is supposed to learn some humility. On our planet he meets Jane (Natalie Portman) and supposedly falls in love.The biggest drawback for me was the humor. There were funny moments that just felt forced. The first time Thor gets tased is chuckle-worthy; when he gets a shot in his butt in order to control him, I start to cringe. When they recreate the fact that Jane hit him with her car, I rolled my eyes.What I absolutely loved about this movie was the ""villain"". I'm still not sure you could call Thor's brother, Loki, the villain. He is such a complex character in this film. There are plenty of twists and surprises from him as this movie progresses. I thought he was the best part.Once the movie was over, including the anti-climactic scene after the credits, I felt like I had just watched a placeholder for The Avengers movie. I realize Captain America is advertised with that theme, but Thor just didn't pack the punch I was hoping for.I'd give this movie a B-. Loki was superb.

1329076,"There are some films that manage to simultaneously warm the hearts of moviegoers and break them. ""Blue Valentine,"" the first major film from writer/director Derek Cianfrance, plays tug of war with your heart for its entire running length. It is a stunning debut from Cianfrance that takes a familiar tune and strips it down to its most raw and unflinching form. This is a film that lives and breathes, as we experience the flames of love being extinguished before our very eyes by the harsh realities of life.""Blue Valentine"" stars Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, two of Hollywood's most talented and courageous actors, in a very low-budgeted, non-Hollywood film that centers on the rise and fall of a young couple's relationship, as they fall out of love after years of marriage.The film begins in the present, and then skips back and forth through time, showing the young couple at two different times in their relationship, from first time that they met to their now doomed and dissolving marriage. Structurally, this can sometimes be a distracting and confusing ploy to make a story of falling romance seem more interesting than it is. That is not the case here, and the film is wonderfully edited.Gosling plays Dean, once a childish but devoted guy who has no big plans for the future except to keep on living each day, waiting for whatever the world has in store for him. He is a nice guy, but as the films reverts the present, we see that being a nice guy is not enough to sustain a happy marriage.Dean's tendency to sit back and be content eventually becomes too much for Cindy (Williams) to deal with. She is a charismatic girl in the beginning who wants to be a doctor one day. When she meets Dean for the first time in the nursing home where her grandmother lives, and where Dean, working for a moving company, is moving in an elderly man, their eyes connect. In that moment, the two actors make us believe that this is something special.These scenes in the past are so wonderfully acted, as the nave and passionate lovers connect and embrace, make love and share each other's dreams.  These passages in the film make it all the more painful when we are reminded of the present, where the passion and honesty are dissolving at a rapid pace. They also have a daughter named Frankie (Faith Wladyka) who was not planned, but who is accepted and loved deeply by her feuding parents.Told in a linear fashion, I think ""Blue Valentine"" would lose a lot of its substance. The big question of what went wrong is never explicitly answered, and I am not certain there is one answer. There is so much authenticity and power in the performances, particularly Williams, who does the most challenging and brilliant work of her career. To pull off the small jump in age (10 or 15 years) that she and Gosling perform effortlessly here seem like it would be incredibly difficult. We are so emotionally invested in Dean and Cindy's lives that we don't doubt it for a second.""Blue Valentine"" stirred up quite a controversy in the movie world when it initially earned an NC-17 rating from the MPAA for a scene of explicit sexuality. After a successful petition, the rating was rightfully dropped to an R. It's a silly thought that in our society, movies like ""Piranha 3D"" and ""Saw"" that contain such gratuitous violence can pass with R-ratings, but as for sexuality (GOD, LET IT NOT BE SO!) there is so little tolerance to spare.This film is a work of art that realizes that in life, there are few easy paths to take. Many questions go unanswered and many days pass unremarkably. From what I have come to understand, the method by which Cianfrance and the two stars handled the material was through much improvisation, which allows for spontaneity and authenticity if handled well. Williams and Gosling are so astonishingly intense and real in this movie that at times it is difficult to watch.But those who can stomach the searing performances will experience a tremendous story of found and lost romance, and one of the best films of 2010.GRADE: A",N/A

1207318,"Dungeons and Dragons (2000)Young Empress, Savina wishes to make great changes to the kingdom of Izmer, establishing equality for everyone, not just the Mages. But the evil Profion plots to usurp her control. Meanwhile, Ridley and Snails are two thieves, unhappy with the Mages' dominance. While stealing from the Mages, the two find themselves wrapped up in a search for a mythical rod that could mean certain destruction if it falls into Profion's hands.  The film has an impressive cast including: Jeremy Irons (Profion), Bruce Payne (Damodar), Justin Whalin (Ridley), Marlon Wayans (Snails), Thora Birch (Empress Savina) and Zoe McLellan (Marina). The comical and almost cartoonish feel make for a fun and light-hearted fantasy with plenty of magic, dragons, and heart. Those unfamiliar with the game (like me) with little-to-no expectations, this was a fun and fast-paced adventure when it released in 2000. Re-watching it in 2011, I found it much more corny, with out-dated special effects. Yet, it was still enjoyable following the thief characters and their party.Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God (2005)Damodar plans revenge against the kingdom of Izmer, capturing a powerful orb in order to summon a dragon to destroy the kingdom. The warrior Berek and mage Melora, along with a diverse group of heroes, fight to reach the orb before Damodar's plans unfold. Bruce Payne (Damodar) is the only returning main character for the sequel. Though, the acting and special effects once again fall flat. The pacing is off and I became confused several times throughout the film, wondering if familiarity with the game is necessary to understand all of the plot elements. This sequel has little else in common with its predecessor. Where the previous was fun and light-hearted, this installment is very violent and humorless. A definitive quest-like adventure, the highlight of the film is the diverse party's various encounters with monsters along their quest.",Dungeons & Dragons / Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God

1377836,"Star Wars -- the modern American epic, a groundbreaking sci-fantasy story, and a pop culture tornado.So whether you love it, hate it, or experience both emotions for different parts of the story, it's undeniable that ""Star Wars: The Complete Saga"" inspires passionate emotion in almost everybody. The original trilogy is absolutely brilliant, the prequel trilogy much less so, but it's definitely one of those things you HAVE to watch one way or another.All six movies form a multigenerational epic -- the prequel trilogy follows the sinister Darth Sidious and his Sith minions infiltrating and slowly conquering the Galactic Republic. In the meantime, the Jedi find a child, Anakin Skywalker, who is said to be the Chosen One (groan, another overused fantasy trope).Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is entrusted with the boy's training, but he cannot stop Anakin's increasingly dark, angry feelings from swaying him. As Darth Sidious manipulates wars, planets and the Jedi Order itself, Anakin becomes his greatest pawn.Then we get to the original trilogy, which takes place about twenty years later. The Republic has turned into the brutal, cruel Empire, but there is a Rebellion fighting against it from the shadows. Young farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) ends up on the run with the mysterious hermit Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), a pair of quirky droids, scruffy pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).As he helps the Rebellion fight the Empire, Luke learns that he has the potential to be a Jedi, and he turns out to be more powerful than anyone expected. However, the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) has a particular interest in Luke -- and soon reveals the shocking connection between them, which will change Luke's life forever.The Star Wars Saga is more than just a series of movies: it's been homaged, spoofed, quoted ripped-off, studied, dissected, analyzed, spun off and even had a tiny religion named after it. It is a pop culture juggernaut, and it is impossible to escape all the stuff connected to it -- honestly, who has never heard ""Luke, I am your father"" (even if that never was actually said)?So how good is it? Well, the original trilogy is absolutely brilliant -- a seamless blend of groundbreaking special effects, classic storytelling and solid acting. Things do get a bit goofy with the introduction of the living teddy bears, but you cannot deny the raw, gritty power of the last scenes of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" or the exultant golden joy of ""A New Hope's"" finale.The prequel trilogy is... not nearly as bad as people say. Yes, it's overloaded with special effects, the stories are flabbier, and Jar Jar Binks makes me want to stab myself in the head with a barbeque fork. But it still has some solid content, such as the Greek tragedy that Anakin's life turns into, or the death of Obi-Wan's mentor Qui-Gon Jinn.Similarly, the acting is a mixed bag. The original trio of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are absolutely brilliant, and there's a real chemistry there that makes you believe that these three are fast friends... and in Han and Leia's case, a bit more (""I love you!"" ""I know""). And you've got the other classic characters: Chewie, the droids, and the hulking deep-voiced Vader.The prequel trilogy has great performances by Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, and the glorious Ian McDermid... buuuuuutt, we're also treated to very wooden performances by Natalie Portman and Hayden Christenson. Especially in their romantic scenes, (""I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life"").Despite its flaws, ""Star Wars: The Complete Saga"" is a movie series that everybody should definitely watch -- it still has plenty of power, imagination and fun.",Star Wars: The Complete Saga - Episodes I-VI
1277518,"The Shield is nothing less than pure brilliance; the storyline and characters are enthralling from the first to last seasons. Shawn Ryan's gritty drama shows Los Angeles' real situation as a city with glamour on the surface, but its underbelly is a seething mass of violence and disillusionment that occurs in any urban environment, despite the image that most people hold. Every member of the cast gave memorable, unbelievably strong performances; given that the cast is so large, again praise must be given to Mr. Ryan and Kurt Sutter for creating storylines that make each character integral. Michael Chiklis as Mackey (definitely a play on Machiavelli) was sheer genius because he captured what we fear in police officers: the ones who make one decision to become as brutal and mercenary as the criminals they claim to protect us from, under ""the shield"" of justice and morality. Walton Goggins was indeed menacing as the ""apprentice"" Shane; this actor was a joy to watch each episode, and along with the simply indomitable CCH Pounder, deserves high marks and awards for his courage in undertaking a very vulnerable and difficult role: these two actors will be the most memorable for me, as Glenn Close and Forest Whitiaker (sic) are a given as masters in any role they are in.

I think this new series with Allison (and the ones with Allie!) is just terrific, giving a great cardio workout in about 50 minutes.  I especially love the ""diagonal"" moves, across the body, which none of the early Firm workouts really has.

1441898,"You've got to hand it to Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. They are a winning team of writers with a pretty good resume of flicks that they've combined on. They did the first three Pirates movies and are together again for 2011's Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Some of the key characters from the predecessors are gone and some are are back in Stranger Tides...while director Gore Verbinski is out and Rob Marshall is in. Together the cast and crew still manage to keep the franchise alive and entertainingThe special effects are great. The movies are visually spectacular with realistic looking at-sea adventure featuring legendary pirates, ghosts, sea monsters and now mermaids...I'd say the amazing effects actually contribute a full star to all of the Pirates movies in this series. There's lots of silliness in the Pirates movies, but it's deliberate. There's slapstick. There are death-defying feats. There's Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) doing his best imitation of Keith Richards (true factoid, he has publicly commented that Richards is his Jack Sparrow character persona inspiration...and by now everyone knows who notice who plays Captain Teague, right?). And all the silliness mostly works. After all, this is Disney and indeed supposed to be a movie for kids too, no?I find it amazing that On Stranger Tides alone has grossed over $1,000,000,000 (that's a BILLION dollars according to Box Office Mojo). It's a good movie that kids can watch too so that's certainly a recipe for success. But a billion dollars?!? Wow. On Stranger Tides, At World's End and Dead Man's Chest are more between a 3 and 4 star rating than the solid 4 star that Curse of the Black Pearl would earn alone. But numbers don't lie. People are drawn to this franchise. I am drawn to this franchise. So bottom line: all four movies offer like 9 hours of time that can be spent nuzzling up with your kids.No, this franchise's ship has not sailed...yet. It continues to please audiences and of course carries an ending that suggests that it has at least one more life left in it.

Pegg and Frost play a couple of sci-fi convention geeks that 'encounter' a real alien--that of course being Rogen/Paul--as they travel home from ComicCon.

I'm fine with a movie that has a message, and I'm neither for nor against a movie with an Atheist message; I was just a little surprised that the movie came on so strong with a ""God does not exist"" message.

1412150,"I had the honor of previewing the extraordinary German-language film ""Vision"", the story of  the great Benedictine nun Hildegard von Bingen. Not since the magnificent 1980's Spanish mini-series ""Teresa de Jesus"" has a film so accurately yet poignantly portrayed a famous woman saint. Newly released on DVD, the Zeitgeist production, directed by Margarethe von Trotta, stars Barbara Sukowa as the enigmatic twelfth century German abbess. One of the most extraordinary figures of the Middle Ages, Hildegard was not only a mystic but an author, a musician, a foundress and a director of souls, learned in the natural sciences as well as in theology and philosophy. She wrote some of the first mystery plays, laying the groundwork for modern drama. Madame Sukowa is able to convey the inner stillness of the contemplative spirit of Hildegard along with her strength and common sense. All the while, the very human side of the saint is always present as she struggles with those who oppose her, as well as with the devil, and with herself.Resisting the temptation to make the film into a piece of feminist propaganda, ""Vision"" portrays Hildegard as an obedient daughter of the Church. Her obedience is by no means mere childish acquiescence, as the vow of obedience is too often misconstrued, but an expression of a vibrant faith. St. Hildegard is not afraid to take a firm but charitable stand against injustice. She will brook no infractions of the Rule which protects the serene and disciplined life of her nuns. She is a true mother ready to fight to the death for her spiritual children.Because of the film's commitment to authenticity there are many elements of medieval life, such as the custom of everyone embracing each other on the lips, which seems odd to modern sensibilities. Hildegard is deposited with the nuns when still a small child as a gift to God from her parents. The cloister becomes the only world she has ever known and the nuns her only family. When a young nun Sister Richardis becomes like the natural daughter she never had, Mother Hildegard objects strongly to Richardis being sent away to become the abbess of another community. At first it appears that the saint has given in to an inordinate attachment but eventually it becomes clear that Hildegard can see that no good will come of the transfer, and she proves to be correct. An exceptionally powerful scene is when Hildegard is summoned to be questioned about her visions by several formidable churchmen. As they glower in anticipation of proving her to be a crazy woman or a demoniac, Hildegard faces them with such calm assurance that there is no doubt as to who will emerge triumphant.Another unique aspect of the film is the rare but real depiction of the vocation of nuns as joyful brides. From the lustrous beauty of the herb gardens to the austerity of the monastic halls, every scene radiates a light and beauty that suggest there is more to living than what the eye can see. Although the viewer is gently and continually reminded of the sacrificial lifestyle of Mother Hildegard and her nuns, a mysterious sense of exultation permeates the film. It becomes clear that while the Benedictines have renounced the world they have been given in return a gift so precious that it is beyond price.(*NOTE: The DVD ""Vision"" was sent to me by the producers in exchange for my honest opinion.)",Vision - From the Life of Hildegard von Bingen

Of the three this one is my favorite. First this is the first version where I feel whisked back into Walter Scott's time. The on-location filming truly adds to this opera though the cinematography is somewhat amateurish and a little fuzzy and washed out. Doe-eyed Anna Moffo is breathtakingly beautiful and her singing first rate (and with only 6 days preparation I might add). The supporting cast are all fine....this Donizetti masterpiece comes to life in this version. The orchestration is not as prominent as newer versions and the sub-titles superb. I did not see a problem with the dubbing since I am always reading the sub-titles. The audio quality was acceptable given when it was shot.

655364,"Since 1990, my siblings and I would watch The Simpsons on TV. As a child, I always wondered what a live action Simpsons movie or an animated one would look like. I own seasons one through six on DVD. As of 2011, The Simpsons is still on the air. Never doubt the efficacy of prayer. In 2007, the producers of the show delivered The Simpsons Movie! It has that sweet Simpsons spirit and it delivers in showmanship. It's also packed with side-splitting jokes and gags. Homer puts a ""SOP"" sign on a road. Homer pollutes a river in Springfield with pig feces and The Simpsons must hide in Alaska. When the EPA tries to destroy Springfield with a giant dome and a bomb, Homer must redeem himself and return to save Springfield. The Simpsons Movie earned its PG-13 rating. There's a sight gag with Bart Simpson riding nude on a skateboard! Marge yells a mild curse word! There's plenty of fan service. The derelict, wrecked, 19 year old ambulance from Bart The Daredevil is still under a tree. The film opens with an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. You can hear Ralph Wiggum humming Alfred Newman's 20th Century Fox fanfare!Hans Zimmer's music score for The Simpsons Movie is very good. Series regular Alf Clausen got the short end of the wedge. Danny Elfman's Simpsons theme music can be heard in the film's score. The cameos by Green Day and Tom Hanks are the only ones still in the movie. An Edward Norton cameo was deleted. It's nice seeing 2-D animation in a contemporary film. CGI and 3-D animation have dominated the industry in the last decade. The Simpsons Movie feels like a movie. It starts out as semi-full screen and the film is in anamorphic widescreen after Professor Frink flies past the screen. There's the usual self-parody. Homer complains that people are paying money to watch something that they can watch for free on television! The Simpsons Movie spoofed one of the most depressing eras of our lives! It's also nice to hear songs by The Turtles and The Carpenters on the soundtrack. Some of the animation in this movie is visually stunning. I sat on the edge of my seat as Homer rode a motorcycle up the walls of the dome and shattered glass covered the screen! The novelty song 'Spider Pig'(a spoof of the Spiderman theme) is already a cult classic. The Simpsons Movie was referenced on the TV show with Marge yelling, ""One Simpsons movie was enough!""

More so now than ever before, action films have drawn upon each other from years - even months - past, all for the sake of placing a stake in present ideologies and notions of what these specific movies are meant to represent. It's limiting, but it can usually mean a quick buck or two for those limited directors who put a bit of effort into creating something moderately intriguing.And then, we have Captain America. Before I could begin to study an odd, nostalgic throwback into the very recent voids of American cinema, Joe Johnston did it for me. Joe Johnston's interpretation of Marvel's sanctuary isn't modern; it's hardly memorable. That said, if Captain America: The First Avenger is anything, it isn't nauseously replicated by experiences months past. It is retro, such is the word that is used so seldom. There are things that a CGI unit can do to evoke such an effect: Grain filters, washed out colors, light blooming; that said, it doesn't necessarily work under the circumstances that most modern films are granted - or, perhaps, burdened - with. Johnston has an eye for these intangibles, not the least of which is dedicated to his work on both the Mummy and the Rocketeer, two completely safe and secure action films which helped to epitomize the 90's before bullet time dominated the scene.It is wholly pulp, characeristically old fashioned, and almost painfully short sighted, but that's where all of the charm seems to lie, anyway. More than anything, Chris Evans' work needs to be applauded. Drawing his own line between insecure empathy and a hoax patriotism of sorts, Evans works well with a role which would be seemingly inflexible, allowing the audience to witness a progression of maturity from what is, perhaps, the most iconic superhero of all. There really isn't much else to say about the performances: Weaving is a hopelessly evil sociopath with superhuman tendencies, Tommy Lee Jones offers some comic relief, and there's a love interest. As far as situational awareness presents itself, these are the basics.Plenty of this is complemented by a massive, exuberant atmosphere which evokes the majesty of the American 40's extremely well. This is most definitely where Johnston and company shine, and it's no surprise, given his extensive track record. Buildings are massive, explosions are pretty, and people die with dignity. It would be hard to call it anything other than pure family fodder if not for Evans' performance, which seems to be a vessel for others to observe and be inspired by. Chris Evans is a man who understands both the innocence and the responsibility of a ""rising"" Captain America, which is undeniably a vital component in establishing a proper atmosphere.The imposing, impressive badass will come later; for now, Captain America is a man limited to his very clean and admirable philosophies, and it's as good a film as any to stem into Whedon's magnificent epic, ""The Avengers!""",N/A
1431018,"That's what I have after watching this dvd twice: a decidedly mixed reaction. Like many other reviewers, I'm a die-hard Jane Eyre fan, having read the book too many times to count and seen at least 6 film adaptations (I think there have been at least 8). This dvd is the 5th I've added to my collection, which my children find absolutely hilarious. But anyway, I wanted to see this one at the theater but it was only in my hometown for about a week, so I ordered it as soon as Amazon had it. I guess I should just lay out my pros and cons and let the chips fall where they may.Pros: The casting is possibly the best of any version I've seen. Mia Whatchamacallit (sorry, can't remember her name right now) was 21 when the film was shot, making her about the right age to play Jane. All the other versions I've seen cast actresses who were well past their teen years, so it was good to see a more-age-approriate Jane. She also did a nice job with the role, expressing shades of emotion in her face since her lines are frankly rather limited. Michael Fassbender is honestly too young (34) and too good-looking (he was the smokin' hot warrior Stelios in 300) but does a very good job inhabiting the character of Rochester. He's very gruff with just the right hint of humor to make Rochester the irritating but somehow intriguing guy he is. The other roles were also well-cast. Judi Dench is always amazing, and Jamie Bell (though not as handsome as St.John should be, imho) was appropriately stern. The cinematography of the movie is just lovely. I really liked the lighting. Everything at Gateshead is sunlit and colorful, belying the hellish existence Jane endures there. Lowood school is spare and colorless, and Thornfield is mostly lighted from underneath with the only light falling on the characters seeming to come from candles and fireplaces. This creates an air of mystery and confusion as the viewer can never really get a good enough view of the place to even be sure of its layout. I liked the notion of starting the story with Jane's escape from Thornfield and the rest being told in flashback, but I can't say if that would be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the story or not.Cons: I suppose nobody could condense this huge novel into a 2 hour movie and not leave out something I thought was important, but I felt too many details were omitted. Jane's character development as well as that of the relationship between Jane and Rochester were dealt with so quickly that they lost some of the depth of emotion they should have had. The conclusion of the film occurs so abruptly that I got a bit angry. It was sort of a ""You've got to be kidding!"" reaction that it just suddenly ended without what I thought was adequate closure. Some scenes, such as Jane's flight over the moors, were lovely but rather long, and I found myself wishing some of those scenes had been cut to give more scenes that ""fleshed out"" the story.So my mixed reaction still allows me to recommend the movie. I think it is a good and respectful adaptation of one of my favorite novels as well as a visually lovely film with a solid cast.",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import
1244347,"After buying and enjoying bothPlanet Earth: The Complete BBC SeriesandLife, I decided to give this a try since the animals are what I liked the most from those programs.  However, I am very glad I waited for it to drop below $10.  There is overlap between this and the two previous programs, and it isn't as in depth as you would expect either.  So, you don't get as much bang for your buck.  Don't get me wrong, the footage/photography is literally amazing and David Attenborough is brilliant once again as narrator. There are six episodes: three based on water/ocean events and three on land.  (The Great Melt, The Great Salmon Run, The Great Migration, The Great Tide, The Great Flood, The Great Feast).I do recommend this, just not at the list price, especially if you already own the other two programs.

1115789,"Typical classic Dinsey movies with classic Don Knotts and Tim Conway slapstick fun.These two make up the Apple Dumpling Gang. And as you would expect, they can't do much right. In the first movie, Donovan is expecting a package. He's not expecting it to be three young children who have been orphaned and need a home. The old colonel from the tv show mash plays judge in this town and he pushes Donovan to do right by the children. Dusty is a wagon driving lady who usually acts like a tom boy. For some reason she's decided to make sure Donovan does right by those children and to help him as well. With this touch of romance come three kids who get into trouble and two criminals in the Apple Dumpling Gang who bumble along. It makes for a great story.The second story is less touching and more slapstick.

1078176,"The final entry in Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's unofficial ""French trilogy"" finds a pair of vagabonds seeking a ride, hop, or skip to a holy site in Spain. But the story isn't about them and their journey so much as it is a narrative of the Catholic Church's blasphemies and contradictions. Bu&ntilde;uel masterfully weaves the film from one scene or character to another naturally, even when both are unrelated. For example, in one scene, a restuarant server is speaking with the cooking staff about the duality of Christ. The vagabonds appear and he kicks them out. The camera follows the server as he greets a pair of patrons and continues the conversation about Christ with them, right where he left off. Many non-sequitors and surreal pieces are stitched in such a manner quite smoothly. This is the weakest of the the three films in the French trilogy (the others being ""Le fantme de la libert&eacute;"" and ""Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie""), but that does in no way mean that it is a weak film in and of itself.",The Milky Way

1410353,"Donnie Yen comes back as Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster Ip Man in this thrilling sequel to the 2008 hit ""Ip Man."" Set in 50s Hong Kong, where injured Ip Man is taken after what happened at the end of the original, the story of the loose biopic takes a similar course to that of its predecessor, though martial arts stunts remain as effective as before.Ip Man and his family move to Hong Kong under British colonial rule, where he opens a martial arts school to propagate his discipline. Things are not easy for the master, however, as a street scuffle involving his first student Wong Shun Leung (Huang Xiaoming) leads to a brawl in the market, and then a fighting ceremony attended by local teachers including a Hung Ga master Hung Chun-nam (Sammo Hung), where, he is informed, the reluctant hero must prove his skills.But Ip Man's courage and strength is really tested when a British boxing champion ""The Twister"" (Darren Shahlavi) insults Chinese martial arts and his country too in public.With Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung, ""Ip Man 2"" does not fail to deliver top quality action scenes aplenty, though some of them clearly rely on wire stunts (which I do not hate). Donnie Yen is in perfect form as the titular hero with fast blows and defenses. His intense close combat style is impressive.With more focus on our hero as a loving husband, ""Ip Man 2"" explores his personality with several episodes not directly related to fighting. Simon Yam reprises the role he played in the original, as Zhou Qing Quan, Yip Man's best friend. Lynn Hung also returns as Ip Man's understanding wife, now pregnant. Even Fan Siu-wong, who played the original's aggressive martial artist-turned robber Jin Shanzhao, shows up.All in all, Wilson Yip, director of the two Ip Man films, manages to keep a brisk pace, though some viewers (especially those who haven't seen the first ""Ip Man"") might think that the film could have been better without some supporting characters. What I find irritating is some of the British actors and their terrible overacting, which I hope is intentional. But, with an amusing reference to Bruce Lee (one of Ip Man's students), ""Ip Man 2"" is an enjoyable martial arts action film.",Ip Man 2

583779,"Hidden in silence delves into an aspect of the Holocaust that is not often known or taught about. Catholics have had some bad press in recent years as more of their darker actions towards the Jews during WW2 have come to light, some of it deservedly so, but this movie transcends that and declares to all that the best of what humanity can do, can and does manifest itself, even in the midst of the baser of human depravity. I enjoyed this movie, I have an avid interest in most things relating to military history, especially WW1 & WW2, and this movie comes from a more 'quirckier' aspect of WW2. The acting is good (though not excellent) and more over tells the viewer a story than one that draws the viewer into it. If the viewer is interested in history, military history, human interaction in the most direst of circumstances and of heroism, heroism not of the sporting variety, but true heroism where someone is willing to sacrifice their lives for others who do not share in their philosophy, then this movie is for you. It is one of hope eternal, of crushing fear and of heroism of the highest order in the midst of and along with the shameable actions of a depraved society. The movie is somewhat dated now but setting that aside it is a movie most enjoyable to watch and a topic which will be discussed for days thereafter.

Troubled kid, shown clearly and without argument to be a troubled kid.  He has a major tantrum, acts out poorly, bites his mom when she tries to corral him, and then runs off into the night.  He runs into the woods, sets sail on a boat to a land far away, populated by monsters.Monsters opt to make him their king instead of eat him.  His reign as king starts out well, and steadily declines.He realizes he's just a boy, not a king, not equipped to make decisions, not someone who should be in charge, and sails home.  He gets home, and his mom gives him cake.Fade to black.Visually:  As I stated above, stunning.  Not just landscapes on the island, which were gorgeous, but early scenes as well.  The disjointed and chaotic feel of the snowball fight between Max and his older sister's friends, sucks you in.You FEEL how being outnumbered and having your snow fort come down around you can be very scary. Innocent kid fun CAN turn scary in an instant, and this scene was particularly effective.Same with the dirt clod fight.  A relatively innocent incident becomes beautiful and chaotic and frightening in a moment, and the violence sways back and forth between being funny and being scary.A final, lesser example, is the dog pile scene.  Max feels secure and safe in a pile of monsters, but as they continue to pile on, you realize he might just get crushed, and his safe security has a bit of a dark side to it all of the sudden.So, a beautiful movie with a thin plot.  It needs strong characters to make it work.We don't really get those, either.This movie calls upon a small boy to carry it on his shoulders.  He does a commendable job, but when his supporting cast is a bunch of dysfunctional monsters, there's only so much we can hope for.I was bored 20 minutes in, though occasionally finding myself in awe of what I was watching, for most of the rest of it.Movie gets three stars because of a random series of moments within the film.Some of the one on one interactions between Max and the two main monsters were touching.For example the scene in the cave, when Carol shows max his model city.I also tended to enjoy the scenes with Max and KW.And there as was the one scene before he sets sail, where he makes up a story to entertain his mom, between bouts of out of control, destructive behaviour.  These brief moments really touched me, and stood out in a mostly boring, but beautiful, movie.",Where the Wild Things Are

196166,"My first encounter with The Plague Dogs was probably a little too young... I was around ten or twelve, and some genius at Blockbuster Video (remember them?) had stuck this in with all the animated kids movies. I bought it on VHS and can still vividly recall watching it in a state of something akin to shock. Not because it graphically depicted the realities of a vivisection lab and the the consequences it had for Snitter, although I will say that the depictions of his deteriorating mental state is something that remained with me for many, many years. And not even because of the two dogs die - and of exhaustion, at that - but because I KNEW, young as I was, that while the story itself was fiction, animal testing was not.And so it was one of those movies that strikes such a chord, you don't know whether it is phenomenally brilliant or the most terrible thing you've ever laid eyes on. Just the thought of it certainly made me physically ill for a long time afterwards.Recently, I was going through some old boxes in the garage and came across my $5 VHS tape from Blockbuster. I popped it into my antiquated old VCR, and the moment the opening credits came up, I could not stop trembling. After having only seen this once, and a good twenty years ago at that, it appears I hadn't forgot a second of this movie. And that was worse than my first time viewing, because now I knew exactly how it would end. Hopeless. There were a few scenes where I had to either stop watching for a moment or fast forward a bit, and I honestly don't know how I made it through this as a kid. Maybe it was so much worse now since after having been breeding dogs for several years, and been involved in the politics of the dog world, I see this movie less as personification and more as a truth we sweep under the rug or worse, trivialize.To be perfectly honest, I was getting more than a little queasy about 3/4 of the way through and finally had to shut it off. The Plague Dogs transcends the politics of animal rights and approaches a terrible subject in a humane manner that forces you to confront these realities. After my second time watching, after having been furious for so many years that some moron stuck this in the family section, I've come to the conclusion that The Plague Dogs IS a children's movie, after all, and am grateful to whomever left it there (on purpose, I suspect) because I think it did go a fair way in turning my stomach to these sorts of practices and forcing me to think. I'd never subject a young child to such disturbing subject matter, but older, more mature children should be given the opportunity to watch this, and when I do have children, I think they will be better, more compassionate human beings for having seen it.",Plague Dogs VHS

But when I saw several actors and actresses from the SyFy Channel I was a bit apprehensive.Carrie is a girl with budding telekinetic ability who lives with a crazy mom who punishes her and locks her in a prayer closet to pray.  Using religion as a punishment/drive tool is pretty bad but Carrie is even more introverted and practically catatonic when it comes to social intercourse among her fellow students.And they are a cruel bunch.  They despise her and do all manner of bullying.  When Carrie has her period in the gym shower, they come up to her and chant ""Period"", I'm sure with the best of intentions to let her know what's happening.  Not!Angela Bettis plays the socially frigid girl quite well.  And her insane mom really goes nuts when Carrie gets to go to the prom with Tommy, who was convinced to do so by his girlfriend Sue Snell (well known to Battlestar Galactica fans as Kandyse McClure).  Her motive is not really clear - looks  like a pity move to me.Spoiler:  The senior prom prank was really bad and set Carrie off on a destructive wave across the town as well as killing most of the students in the process - many deserved it, frankly.  This film was more a psychological study in bullying than a horror film, which is fine with me!Bottom Line:  Surprisingly good!

450286,"Ok, here's some mind-blowing news that the director might not have figured out. Disco was an African American and gay music. Another fact that he might not know - Studio 54 was run by a Jewish homosexual. Fact # 3 - you can't have a long conversation in a New York City club because it's too loud to hear anything you say. You have to shout everything and the best you can hope for is a nod and a smile before it becomes too unbearable for words.Yet somehow Stillman decided to portray disco in the same way he portrayed Upper East Side private club like a salon like environment peopled almost exclusively by wealthy white people pontificating on nonsense and cartoons, all the while wonder if their upper class white privilege is justified (short answer - why yes it is). There's some disco playing, but it's happily playing at low volumes in the background just so you know that it's about disco. There's not much of a story here but what passes for a sub-plot is stolen whole cloth from the travails of Studio 54 including the unfortunate hubris that would lead the club owners to brag about all the money they were ferreting away from the IRS that would lead to a raid that would find that money and the cocaine.What ultimately kills this movie is the fact that it's unbearably dull. No one has any passion or interest beyond talking about trivialities (the Scrooge McDuck conversation gets heavy rotation) and in the end, one of the bland characters says that disco is really fun and great. And then they go on the subway and start dancing the white man's overbite.Metropolitan has its charms despite being about people I normally find repugnant but this thing is just a sad little attempt to expand past the Upper East Side in that white racist fantasy of what New York could be like - if only the minorities weren't everywhere.",The Last Days of Disco VHS

They are lovely but they are 100% committed to the discipline.

1381973,"WOW pity it is only available on region two but at $50 it is worth buying a region free player. I first heard about this series through the US remake. The US ending was stellar for Life on Mars, far different from the UK ending, which was good but not as ""WOW"" as the US. Then I find Ashes to Ashes and this series ending is incredible, brilliant.Won't give any spoilers but my suspicions about certain characters from Mars were confirmed in the finale.TV like only the Brits can do. I am so happy that we here in the colonies finally decided to add better continuity and closed series arcs. as good as it started M*A*S*H ran about 10 years too long. UK has far less jump the shark series  and Mars and Ashes prove it. As much as I loved John Simms and his ""Sam Taylor"" I was most happy to see Philip Glenester reprise the Gene ""Genie"" Hunt. A brilliant actor. My one observation, that compared to a real 1980's cop show , Miami Vice... Ashes didn't capture the 80's (And I even spent a good part of 1982 in London.)

960009,"2005's ""The Proposition"" is a Western that takes place in Australia, and it's far from a typical Western.THE PLOT: Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) is the new lawman of the territory and he's determined to civilize this brutal wasteland. In his way is a band of outlaws comprised of three brothers and a few others, but two of the brothers want out after the leader, Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), savagely murders a family in one of his raids. The two brothers are apprehended by Capt. Stanley, who offers a proposition to the older of the two, Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce): Find and assassinate the leader and both will go free. Charlie agrees to the assignment to save his little brother, not to mention he believes Arthur crossed the line when he killed the innocent family, which included a wife with child. Plus Charlie seeks redemption.As far as filmmaking, cinematography, actors, locations, soundtrack & editing go this is a top-of-the-line film with a surreal, haunting edge. As my title blurb suggests, there are similarities to ""Heart of Darkness"" and the original ""Apocalypse Now,"" although it fails to achieve the greatness of the latter.The story plays out in a realistic manner with long stretches of drama and bleak landscapes interspersed with flashes of extreme violence. Ray Winstone and Guy Pearce are great as the two main protagonists. Capt. Stanley understandably wants to rid the land of the brute outlaws, whereas Charlie seeks redemption for himself and his little brother. Danny Huston as Arthur Burns is captivating as the focal point and villain. Yet he's not a villain in the cliched sense and he's not one-dimensional. He loves the beauty of God's creation, he loves the art of language and he's a mystic of sorts, but he clearly crossed the line at some point in his outlaw endeavors and now must be wiped off the face of the planet. Will Charlie do it?My only criticism is that the film seems too short. It needed more time for details and character development. As it is, we sort of have to guess the details, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just wish the film would have gone the route of ""Apocalypse Now: The Complete Dossier (Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now Redux)"" and given us more definition and development. Another minor criticism is that I wished they picked someone other than Emily Watson to play Capt. Stanley's wife. Not that she does a bad job in the role; it's just a matter of taste.The runtime is 104 minutes.FINAL WORD: ""The Proposition"" is one of those films that gets better with repeat viewings, as long as you like the approach of films like ""Apocalypse Now,"" albeit way shorter (too short). I would love to see a Director's Cut that adds about 20-45 minutes.GRADE: B+ or A-",Proposition Pal/Region 4

1381037,"Ever see the movie 'Hercules' with  Lou Ferigno?  And the scene where the special effects had a teddy bear spinning in the sky trying to depict the constellation Orion? Well, there are some special effects  that borderline on the comical in film. I had to bite my lips to keep from laughing at times during 'Black Swan'.  Final scene:  a  gaping, growing abdominal wound worsens on a ballerina with  a self mutilation psychosis as she moans something about being 'perfect now'.  Too much mirror had been  crammed into her abdomen by her own hand.  Dunno. That crater wound from a sliver coupled with the choreographer's asking in falsetto tone--and too calmly-- if she's alright.  Hmmm. The scene where her mother's paintings dance around is just plain funny as well.  I dislike this film for making me laugh at moments that were totally inappropriate:))Second point, though a technical afterthought. Having gone to school with a doc who wanted to write,  I remember his  wanting to fit all of  Polti's plots into  a magnum opus. His first book.  Well if someone told me that this doc had written 'Black Swan', I'd believe them.  Self mutilation,  a body dysmorphic diagnosis and a doppelganger or  an ego dissociation thing hit the fan in this film.  And the attempts to blend this all together into a cohesive piece of art was, not entirely, but in part, a chuckle producer.",Black Swan

1240913,"These hallows are not only ""deathly,"" they're ""darker than dark.""Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly ""in support."" All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Voldemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.Summing up: Many of the ""dark"" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.",N/A

1419855,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Ignoring all the real-life hubbub about Kercher and Knox, Murder on Trial in Italy is an okay made-for-TV film. Hayden Panettiere does a fine job making Knox a bit ambiguous. She doesn't play her as the trumped-up sexpot of the media, nor as the innocent angel her supporters would have you believe in. Instead, she's confused young woman who we can't quite believe. Some of her actions can put down to her age and inexperience, but others are a bit more troubling. Knox's supposed partner in crime, Guiliano Mignini, is ably played by Vincent Riotta, who bears a striking resemblance to his real-life counterpart in some shots. The film also managed to snag the dependable Marcia Gay Harden as Amanda's mother. She's the one responsible for really driving home the prosecutorial aspect of Amanda's treatment.Despite the sensational aspects of the film's title, and the trial, the film could be a lot worse. Sticking to a fairly simple flashback structure, it starts with the discovery of the body and works backwards to fill in the details of Amanda's life.Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy comes to DVD in a simple, solid package. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is bright and colorful, belying the dark nature of the story. I didn't notice any significant compression or authoring problems, and this DVD looks about as good as you can expect from contemporary television. The audio is a bit less impressive, but totally serviceable. Dialogue is kept clear in this simple stereo mix, never overwhelmed by effects or music.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",Amanda Knox: Murder On Trial In Italy

310459,"The year is 1953. An exterminator named William Lee (played by Peter Weller) almost loses his job after he visits a house that's infested with cockroaches. It turns out that his wife stole most of the insecticide from his own canister in order to turn it into full-fledged drugs. William joins in on her hazardously unique way of experiencing mental ecstasy. The next day, however, he is arrested by the police and is accused of misusing his own insecticide. At this point, William is convinced that the present situation is actually a hallucination. It is not known whether this scene is real or not. In fact, at this point in the film, the story becomes much more complicated. Up until the end, almost everything turns surreal. Whatever he's experiencing, William may either be hallucinating or just wishing he was hallucinating. There are only a few situations in which it's pretty obvious that everything is real. But then, when the typewriter/bug hybrids come along (complete with English-speaking anuses), it becomes a puzzling sight.Naked Lunch is based on the novel of the same name by William S. Burroughs. I personally have never read it, but I'm pretty sure that it's just as baffling and grotesque as this film adaptation. The characters are almost unrealistic, and I don't mean that they're cardboard cutouts. I'm saying that a majority of them (especially William and Yves Cloquet) have very odd personalities. It must be Burroughs's original intentions, though the characters still look very awkward onscreen (sometimes to the point that the bug/typewriter hybrids and the giant centipedes actually look more authentic). The story itself has a few problems of its own. First, it focuses on William whose early assumptions lead him to believe that he has to go up against a secret organization called Interzone Inc. But then, in the middle of the film, the story switches to somewhat of a study on homosexuality and human sexuality in general. Keep in mind, I have nothing against homosexuality. It's just that it's almost as if this abrupt change comes out of nowhere, and is almost irrelevant when discussed onscreen. The film's awkward structure proves that it's roughly impossible to adapt a Burroughs novel, especially if it mixes social commentary with gruesome imagery. If it were animated, it would have been more successful with its storytelling. A modernist cartoon style would have created an excellent spectacle of Burroughs's wild imagination. Seeing it in live-action, however, makes it more of an unintentionally puzzling experience.Fortunately, despite all of the things that are wrong with this film, Naked Lunch is still an intriguing and wildly entertaining film. The look and feel of the film is quite hypnotic. The dull lighting and the overall murky colors of the environment really add to the surreal tone of the story. The bizarre creatures in the film are strangely imaginative, while the apparent gore is strong and will no doubt displease many soft-hearted moviegoers. The special effects are quite impressive: the use of real puppetry instead of CGI is a stunning accomplishment. The atonal music score from Howard Shore is rightfully barbaric as it fits with the film's nonsensical surroundings. The performances are good for the most part. Peter Weller gives a straightforward performance with his no-nonsense appearance. Ian Holm and Roy Scheider appear for a short time, but both of their presences onscreen are still potent. Judy Davis as Joan is decent at best.Director David Cronenberg, who has created controversial cult classics such as Scanners (1981) and Crash (1996), is a person who will only satisfy those of certain tastes. Mainstream critics deny his distinctive filmmaking talent, but those who are more open-minded find his films very compelling to watch. Naked Lunch can be best described as a film that'll please Cronenberg's die-hard fans. It has that dark flair and nasty ambiance that's found in his other films. While I am intrigued by the typewriters and the anthropomorphic amphibians, I find myself baffled by the main purpose of the story. I guess it remains ambiguous, though I still wish that the film gave thorough explanations of what was going on, especially near the end. Otherwise, the look and feel of the film is uniquely fantastic.Grade: 8.2 out of 10",N/A

I always thought trying to watch a Yoga DVD would not be effective, since there is no teacher present to answer questions or help adjust posture and offer suggestions. However at this time I am unable to attend any yoga classes because of my schedule. I purchased this item because I was looking for a way to work on back strength and to help with muscle soreness and strain. What I was not expecting was the number and different types of props used in the video. I was able to improvise and some of the props he uses are expensive and I have no intention of getting them.  A list of the kind of props needed or their equivalent would have been helpful - either in the Amazon description or on the back of the case.  That said, I have enjoyed the dvd and found it very easy to follow along and it is quite suitable for beginners. Although I am not a rank beginner, because of my muscle issues I found it helpful, especially before retiring for the night. Rodney explains and demonstrates the poses in a way that is easy to follow, even on the first viewing. And the pace is relaxed enough, so that someone with very tender muscles can keep up. The bonus section on sitting posture was very helpful and a good reminder about chair ergonomics and body mechanics for working while sitting on a chair at a desk.

180421,"there was nothing like it. Graphics at the time were primarily 8-bit.  Videogames were seen as a niche amusement, and computers were for business. It's lucky for everyone that Disney took a chance on a concept they didn't really understand and greenlit this movie. And who would've thought that the project would attract the likes of artists like Syd Mead and Moebius, and fire the imaginations of artists and programmers everywhere. Look at the opening reveal of the whirling insides of CLU's tank.  It's a stunning synthesis of art, film and sound- it was a new visual language. It paved the way for CGI, and to a lesser degree it also popularized the idea of free networks, at a time when people didn't know what a network was. I feel that the sequel really missed a golden opportunity to make some social commentary about how far we've come since the first film.Tron came out at a time when personal computers and cel-phones were science fiction ideas. Creating a representational world of the inside of a computer was pure greek to the older generation, but us children?  We got it. I saw Tron in the theater when I was 14 and I was overwhelmed by the artistry of it. I don't know if children today could click with it.  Videogames are passe now and graphics are expected to look more real than real life, so I think Tron will best be remembered by those who saw it when it came out and were drawn into it's neon minimalist world.To those fans I will report I am very impressed with this bluray.

1337384,"RAMPAGE is a tale of rage, psychopathy, and insanity. Is it a revenge film? No. An exploitation movie that simply glorifies violence? No. RAMPAGE is about a man (Brendan Fletcher) who is a seething, twisted mass of hatred, laziness, and self-pity. He is a product of his own vision of a world gone mad. This man's actions are neither anti-heroic nor purely nihilistic, since he actually believes he's doing society a favor. You see, to this man, we're all spoiled brats who just need a good thrashing. Inside, buried deep, is his hatred and terror that he's just like everyone else, and therefore deserves to die. However, he's not suicidal enough to simply shoot himself. No, he protects himself w/ body armor and a fool-proof plan to annihilate others instead. His entire universe is based on how much it sickens him. He sees the world as a hideous place that only seeks his unhappiness. This allows him to avoid taking any personal responsibility. Remember also, this guy is never portrayed as anything more than pathetic. Watch his interactions w/ his oblivious parents and his so-called ""best friend"" for examples of his self-absorption and bitterness. His life is a dead-end. He's going nowhere. At 23 years old, he's already quite empty and dead internally. Due to his own indolence, he lives in constant agony. Now, it's time for him to spread some pain around...",N/A

803699,"Stephen King wasn't exactly in peak form when he wrote Fire starter, so this 1984 movie adaptation was at a disadvantage even before the cameras rolled. There were so many King movies being made at the time that this one's weaknesses became even more apparent. In her first film role after her memorable appearance in E.T., Drew Barrymore stars as a little girl whose parents acquired strange mental powers after participating in a secret government experiment. From this genetic background she has developed the mysterious ability to set anything on fire at will, especially when she's angry. That makes her very interesting to government officials seeking to exploit her skill as a secret weapon. Her father seeks to protect her by using his powers of mind-control, and George C. Scott plays an Indian who believes the girl must be destroyed. There's a routine climax involving a lot of impressive pyrotechnics, but none of this is grounded in a dramatically solid foundation, and none of the characters are developed enough for us to care about them. So the movie gradually turns into a laughable thriller with no suspense whatsoever. It's a movie only a pyromaniac could love.",N/A

It just had no appeal for me and actually lived up (or is that down?) to my low expectations.If I wanted a political movie, I'd look for a documentary. This was basically Cameron's liberal views glossed over by colorful characters and scenes. Apparently audiences really are dumbed down if they find this drivel so entertaining.

428479,"Voted for Best Foreign Film in 1997, this Czech film takes place in 1988 thus covering a political backdrop that plays a role.Franta is an elderly bachelor, womanizer, lonely, and has sex with younger women and/or married women.  A cellist, he is no longer with the  Czech  Orchestra, and making ends meet playing funerals.Low on funds, he is finally seduced by money and  is encouraged to enter into a fake marriage to a younger woman.  Although the marriage seems mighty short, the woman leaves, she leaves him with a sweet, tender, 5-year old boy Kolya.Although the outcome is rather predictable, this was a touching story that held the viewer's interest, just to see the bonding between an elderly bachelor, making room and time for a child, a shift in his lifestyle.  Even  though it is predictable, the film holds your interest as the sweet child Kolya opens to his guardian, as Franta becomes attached and must thwart off any police suspicions relating to his fake marriage.This was an amazing child actor.  Not once did you see that he was acting.  Most foreign films have really good child actors, and this is no exception.  Great bonding story!!  Rizzo",N/A
227594,"1986 saw the return of Ripley in Aliens, which was directed by James Cameron(yes, that James Cameron). This science-fiction action film follows Ripley as she returns to the planet where she first encountered her first Alien creature. Only this time, she is accompanied by a unit of Colonial Marines.One thing you'll notice with this film that's different from the first film is that this film has more action in it and less horror in it. Although, there are moments where things are intensely frightening. Like the product review states, it's one of those rare cases when the sequel outdoes the original. While the majority of the masses out there will mention The Terminator as being Cameron's claim to fame, I honestly believe this movie was. I'll probably get alot of flack for saying this but, after viewing this and The Terminator, I feel this movie was a little more solid in terms of story and whatnot.Overall, even though the original will hold a special place in my heart, Aliens is the best movie out of the bunch.",N/A
1212716,"Another reviewer said it exactly as I would; this film written, directed and starring Paul Gross gets SO much right--the battle scenes in particular and just a small amount 'wrong'. Paul Gross is terrific here and is so compelling as the smart, tough, Canadian soldier who comes home on leave from the War. He is very far from his 'goofy', but likeable character he plays in Due South from his TV show. The depiction of the hand to hand combat scenes is every bit as good as seen in Saving Private Ryan. But when Paul's love interest shows up at the Field Hospital just behind the front lines where he's stationed, and they kiss while the bombs are landing around them, a lot of the credibility factor in the movie goes right out the window. The final scene played out like some modern version of the crucification of Christ, either works for you--or it doesn't. I was ok with it and I still give the movie 5 stars but it isn't the perfect WWI film. (The Blue Max still has that title).",Passchendaele
462714,"This has an interesting story as well as some good gore. The entire film is well made and it's not a bad film, but it needs some energy because the slow pacing hinders the film a bit.  It's about a guy who ventures into the countryside and is bitten by a sickly woman in an abandoned house.  The bite is infectious and he slowly begins to decay, and this leads him to eating human flesh.  I gave it three stars at first, but it seems to improve with another viewing.  Tom Parkison also made a film called DEAD CREATURES.  That film is well done, but it also has a slow pace that hinders the film. The tone of the film is quite morbid, and some may find it to be depressing. The violence and gore tries to be impactful and grim; the gore isn't fun type gore that you will find in many other zombie flicks. I thought the directing was petty good, but it lacks action and isn't recommended if you're looking for a fun party type zombie film with a lively tone. Some of the soundtracks may also be considered kind of depressing to some. There's no nudity in the film.The DVD quality is good.","I, Zombie"

The editing isn't great, but it's good enough to evoke what needs to be felt. The place where it breaks down is with the cast.Adam Kantor makes a passable Mark, but lacks the manic charm of Anthony Rapp. His vocals are solid and he does enough to carry the part.Will Chase is brutal as Roger though. His performance is more hammy than pained and his vocals get rather pitchy at times. Compare his version of ""One Song, Glory"" to Adam Pascal's version or the others who have filled the role and it just falls short. He's also pitchy at times and has to slide in to the right note too often. If intentional it's unfitting. It's a staple in country and even in some rock genres but sounds out-of-place in this context.Tracie Thoms and Eden Espinosa do a fine job in their roles as JoAnne and Maureen, respectively, but they're the only two who seem to give a perfarmance at least evocative of the original cast. Michael McElroy does a fine job, he's just not Jesse Martin which isn't ""fair"" I know as those are tough shoes to fill. Wilsone Jermaine Heredia was also a tough act to follow, and while Justin Johnston was good, again, tough shoes to fill.Renee Goldsberry is absolutely gorgeous as Mimi but just sems to be missing that extra bit of brassiness Daphne Rubin-Vega and others brought to the role.Casts change as actors move on and it's still a worthy performance. For those who haven't seen the play I suggest it, for those who have seen it with the original cast it's also still a good view, just not quite as ""magical"".",N/A
1080407,"A lot of people put a huge importance on whether or not a movie is 100% faithful to the novel it's based on.  I can certainly understand that.  If you've read the novel, you really want the movie to be faithful to the novel.  Count Dracula - BBC miniseries (1977) is nearly 100% faithful to Bram Stoker's 1897 novel.  Great.  Does this make it a great movie?  Not necessarily.This TV miniseries is 150 minutes, but the problem is that it's slow moving, dull, and rather boring.  It does have some eerie moments, some scary moments, and pretty good sound effects.  The musical score, however, is just fair at best and doesn't appear often enough throughout the movie, but that's OK, because the music just doesn't fit the type of movie this is, anyway - a Dracula movie.  The music sounds like it would fit right in with that old TV show called The Friendly Giant.  The music is very low volume, also.  There is way too much silence without music in this movie.  There are so many scenes that could use a heavy dose of dramatic music, but the music is either absent altogether or just wrong for the scene.  The movie struggles to maintain energy due to its length.  It loses steam, then things pick up again, then loses steam again.  It simply lacks power.  It lacks that much needed ""oomph"".How are the sets and special effects?  They are on the cheap side, but this isn't something I really complain about.  In fact, I'm a fan of ""raw"" low tech stuff over CGI any day.  I'm just pointing this out as part of my overall review of this movie.  The castle footage is dark and haunting.  The night footage outdoors is creepy.  However, I found huge inconsistencies with how the movie was shot.  One minute it looks like a TV movie with grainy film, then the next minute it looks like a daytime soap opera shot with videotape.  This inconsistency in filming techniques was distracting.  Grainy picture, then clear picture, then back to grainy, then back to clear.  Weird.The acting, in my opinion, is wooden for the most part.  The best acting came from Judi Bowker (of Clash Of The Titans fame).  Louis Jourdan's portrayal of Count Dracula was fair.  Nothing great.  He was too stoic, dull, and ordinary looking.I recommend this movie only for people who insist that Dracula movies follow the novel faithfully.  If you don't mind if a Dracula movie doesn't follow the novel faithfully, then I recommend other movies, such as Horror Of Dracula (1958), Dracula (1979), and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  These movies are shorter, maintain a higher intensity, and have great musical scores that liven things up.  Horror Of Dracula's musical score is by James Bernard.  Dracula 1979's musical score is by John Williams.  Bram Stoker's Dracula has a musical score by Wojciech Kilar.  Music can make all the difference in the world.",N/A

64861,"EXTREMELY MILD SPOILERS AHEADThere was a rash of ""suburban everyman"" family comedies in the 80s, and a sub-sub-genre of ""suburban everyman goes on vacation and is hilariously out of his element and experience hijinks.""  Most were crap, and the average moviegoer can be forgiven for mistaking this film for one of those.  But it really doesn't fit the mold.  I don't know if the filmgoers were purposefully spoofing such films or not, but the plot was described as ""a man goes on vacation in his own neighborhood.""To be totally honest, I never thought the ""vacation"" angle came across as strongly as may have been intended.  It's more of a ""weekend"" movie than a ""vacation"" movie, to me.Anyway, the basic story is that a man and his oddball neighbors in a middle-class, middle-American cul-de-sac spend the weekend trying to get to the bottom of what their new reclusive neighbors are up to.  Why do they never show their faces?  Why do they keep their house in such bad condition?  Why are they out digging in their yard at night?  Why do they drive their trash to the garbage can and then beat the heck out of it with a rake at midnight in the rain?  And so on.  Are they....gasp....a cult of murderous satanists?Rick Ducommun, Bruce Dern, and Tom Hanks give epitaph-worthy performances.  I don't think I've ever seen Hanks do physical comedy in anything else, but his stumbling-down-the-stairs bit near the end is worthy of Keaton (I'm not really spoiling anything).This is a perfectly-paced, impeccably-timed comedy masterpiece.  It blends farce, slapstick, adventure, horror, suspense, and contains the kind of breezy, highly-entertaining, just-plain-fun film-making that is perfect for gatherings of family and friends.  This is one of those movies that could only have been made in the 80s, and I mean that in the good way.",N/A
1327467,"Tell Tale (Michael Cuesta, 2009)This is another of those pleasant-surprise films that simply disappeared into the ether. It showed at Tribeca, failed to find an American distributor, and went straight to DVD a year later. On the other hand, successful festival runs in other parts of the world led to theatrical releases in France, Singapore, Greece, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, South Africa, Australia... and the list goes on. Why is it that other countries are so able to recognize the worth of smaller American films, while those of us who like to see things on the big screen are so often spoon-fed the lowest common denominator? (I already think I know the answer to that question, but I'm hoping if I keep asking it, the studios who refuse to take chances on intelligent, low-budget movies like this will get the hint.)This is, in fact, an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", but it's not one you're likely to recognize. Scriptwriter Dave Callaham (The Expendables) turned the story on its head; in this case, we have a heart transplant patient who has also gained some of the memories of the donor, who was murdered. Terry (Poseidon's Josh Lucas), said patient, becomes obsessed with solving the donor's murder. Problem is, he's becoming somewhat divorced from his own reality, which places a strain on his relationship with Elizabeth (300's Lena Headey, currently filming the Game of Thrones adaptation for HBO), his daughter Angela (Toy Story 3's Beatrice Miller)'s doctor. It's not enough Terry's got a bad ticker, his kid has a nasty, and incredibly rare, genetic defect. Not a lucky family by any means, right? So maybe it's not all that bad a thing when Terry starts gaining not only the donor's memories, but also his personality. (Here's a great example of possession for you: his blood type changes to the donor's. According to the doctor in the film, it's rare, but does happen; I have yet to be able to substantiate this with my own research.) Certainly not in the eyes of Sergeant van Doren (Red's Brian Cox), the lead detective on the case. Why not let the inspired amateur do all the work for him? Problem is, the donor doesn't just want answers, he wants revenge.I've only touched on the cast here, which also includes Michael K. Williams (The Road) Ulrich Thomsen (Adam's Apples), Jamie Herrold (Natural Born Killers), Dallas Roberts (Walk the Line), and a host of other luminaries you'll probably recognize just enough to say ""hey, I know that guy, but can't place him..."". They're all good actors, and they all turn in solid performances here. Well, almost all. Headey stretches probability a few times, though that is less a function of her acting ability than it is the script needing her to not kick this guy to the curb. She does the best she can with the movie's main weakness. The mystery angle is solid, and while you probably won't be terribly surprised by it (it's a common enough urban legend that I can think of at least three films off the top of my head that use it), it matches up with everything that comes before it. Callaham knows how to write a mystery. Which kind of surprises me given his other output; this is by far the best work he's ever produced. Cuesta, on the other hand, is solid through and through, having turned in the movie L. I. E. and long, successful stints on both Six Feet Under and Dexter. You probably missed this one the first time around, unless you live on the Lower East Side. It's worth discovering now. *** ",Tell Tale
489040,"With its epilogue, the Chinese epic ""Aftershock"" makes it known that it wants to stand as a tribute to the estimated 240,000-250,000 lives lost in the devastating earthquake in Tangshan circa 1976. This horrendous quake decimated the city, destroyed lives, and ripped families apart. And any film that wants to honor the heroism and perseverance of the citizens that emerged from tragedy to rebuild not only their city but their lives is worthy of respect for its good intentions. But as I've said often in judging films--good intentions only take you so far! ""Aftershock"" is much more than its message--it is also an unforgettable and compelling family drama that spans over 30 years. It is an extremely satisfying historical epic that also tells a quietly powerful story about the long range affects that one night had on a family (and by extension, a nation). So, by all means, come to ""Aftershock"" for its good intentions but don't lose sight that it is also tremendous filmmaking!If I had my druthers, I would have wanted to go into the film without knowing the major components of its plot. However, some of the details seem to be inescapable if you look at any of the marketing material, advertising, or product descriptions. The film does begin with a spectacular sequence recreating the Tangshan quake. It's a realistic and harrowing depiction that would stand on par to any contemporary special effects you'd see in Hollywood blockbusters. But this is no empty headed disaster film (which I love), but something much more heartfelt and affecting. On this fateful evening, a family of four is divided and it's not until 32 years later where they will all understand the truth of the night. The father is killed, the mother and her son live haunted by their memories, and the daughter is raised by a foster family. We see all the characters at intervals in their lives and, though the earthquake may be history, it and its aftershocks are carried within the psyche of everyone that lived through it. The film culminates with a 2008 Sichaun earthquake that forces our characters to confront one another again. It's incredibly potent and moving drama. Truly!I, more than anything else you're likely to read, have been purposefully vague about the details of the movie. The film would be better served if its plot unraveled naturally without expectation. Wildly popular in China, ""Aftershock"" has become that country's highest grossing domestic film ever and was submitted for Academy consideration as China's contender for a Best Foreign Film Oscar (although sadly, it was not nominated). The cast is superb and the screenplay is surprisingly understated. The film is wildly dramatic but it wisely stays away from melodrama. In other hands, this story might have been engineered as weepy and overwrought. Here, I believed the final revelations and reunions because they played on a more realistic keel. They're still likely to make you cry like a baby, but none of the emotion is forced or false. Great actors, with a great screenplay, in a great film. In case I haven't been clear, I think ""Aftershock"" is quite a special film! Check it out. KGHarris, 10/11.",N/A

1160187,"Yes the quality of the transfer to DVD is so so, but so was watching television in 1959.I first purchased the set through ""Classic Theatre of New York"" 2006 in 4 volumes, I was mostly pleased withwhat I received, the packaging was okay with 8 DVD per volume.There was only a photograph on the DVD and once played just a typed list of 4 episodes per DVD,yes they were copies only with nothing much professional about the release, and yes DVD of volume 4only contained 8 episodes of the ""Addams Family""rather than what I expected.So later I went and bought the ""Platinum"" release, 3 volumes in plastic sleeves for $300 Aus,which in 2011 is worth more than the U.S $.  ""Digitally Remasted Sound Enhanced"", pretty impressivefor episodes that were basically the same as my previous purchase.Though there were improvements, such as on the front of each DVD there listed the 4 episodes therein,and once played there were a proper list of each episode with a main photograph in the centre,although DVD 38 of volume 3 did not play.So I have replaced my original set with the ""Platinum"" set in the original containers - as I do not carefor plastic sleeves- and I have my missing episodes from the original set,Roustaboat.....

1356338,"It is based on true events so the story caught my attention.  The story line reminded me of ""We Were Soldiers"" in  many ways.  The story line is tight and consistent starting from recruits to ending with seasoned war fighters who engaged an enemy that still uses old people, women and children as their own military tatical defensive line of protection which causes the enemy to create their own moral responsibility for causing their own women, children and old people having to be killed.  The characters held their character roles so the acting was convincing.  It is a soldiers tale and it is done very well.  Viewing a war through a Soviet point of view where the enemy refuses to fight by a demarcation between combatants and non-combatants and results in using all of their own people in the role of combatants was very informative.  Having been a paratrooper, I felt an affinity with them.",N/A
1224573,I agree with those reviewers who feel that this film is more successful in its characterizations of Holmes and Watson than the Rathbone/Bruce films so popular years ago. I'm always happy to see a Holmes film that does not make Watson the bumbling idiot that Bruce did so well in those tributes to Conan Doyle's favorites.  The Jeremy Brett series also does a great job at showing Watson to be a truly valuable associate that Holmes really does rely on quite a bit on several occasions.  I still have to admit that I adore Basil's Holmes without a doubt but was extremely satisfied with Downey's take on the man also.  I loved the chemistry between Downey and Law and would love to see more of them together in these roles. I thought Mary Morstan was not very well portrayed but there's not a whole lot to go on as far as her personality in respect to her and Watson as a couple though of course she is their first client in the stories.  The Irene Adler angle was cute and I feared they would let the sensuality go too far with she and Holmes and it did come close but luckily the movie makers backed off before they had officially blown it.  Sherlock would never let himself become distracted over a female - not even a hot one.  He's polite and often kind to women where appropriate but he does not dwell on them in any other way - including Irene.  He's impressed with her intelligence and respects her for it.  That's all!  But we must allow Guy Ritchie some leeway and some fun here and he does it without disrespecting our heroes original image. I thought Jude Law was tremendous - can't overstate that here - and Downey was funny and clever though I would have liked to have seen him do more of what we love Holmes for (the facts from small items) without so many of the small facts being so contrived.  I wish they hadn't made the supernatural an aspect of this - even though the explanations are based on truths and not on metaphysical mumbo jumbo - it still was a bit of a sell out and I wish mysteries in general would avoid the Scooby Doo themed stuff.  (Except when it is Scooby of course).  I loved the music and the art theme and creative direction in this movie. Mark Strong is scary and unattractive as the bad guy (wow - Mr. Knightley sure looks different huh?).  Oh and love the fact that the script made a point of mentioning Mycroft (Sherlock's older bro).  Holmes fans had to have loved that!  I know I did.,N/A
178699,"I've had a love-hate relationship with ""Legend"" since first viewing it as a pre-teen. On the one hand, it is visually resplendent and features Tim Curry in a knock-out performance as one of the screen's best representations of the Lord of Darkness. On the other, the plot is threadbare, the comic relief characters are utterly juvenile and annoying, and Tom Cruise's Jack is nothing more than a stock character -- even his name is generic.I had purchased and loved and then loathed and sold the Ultimate Edition DVD several years ago, but because of the film's lush aesthetics and the high visual fidelity of Blu-ray, I decided to give this disc a chance.Upon reflection, especially after a recent viewing prior to this review, it seems that a person's enjoyment of the film is largely dependent on what that person brings to their viewing. It has been some time since I have viewed the Theatrical Cut in its entirety, but regarding Ridley Scott's preferred Director's Cut, I have found that the film works best by treating it as an ""art film"" in the vein of Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" a reference that Scott points to in the extras, and focusing on the gorgeous designs, William Hjortsberg's poetic dialogue, and -- rather than the lackluster plot and characterizations -- the Freudian subtexts woven throughout: the obsession over the power of the unicorn's horn, Darkness appearing out of Lily's reflection, his muscular, engorged red form with his own gigantic horns... you get the idea. In this manner, the film becomes less an underwhelming adventure and more of a fable regarding Lily's sexual awakening and the struggle between pure love and insatiable lust. This interpretation isn't perfect, but IMHO it creates a more satisfying and interesting viewing experience than taking the film at face value.Regarding the Blu-ray itself, both the Director's Cut and the Theatrical Cut are presented in entirely separate transfers. Scott provides textual disclaimers before either version. While at first glance the Theatrical Version appears sharper and more colorful, I found this look to be oversaturated and could indeed detect some edge enhancement. The Director's Cut is far more natural (and classy) in the tone of its colors, as well as still providing an awesome level of detail in the elaborate sets; minor specks of print damage do pop up from time to time on this version, so it isn't pristine, but it is still extraordinary to look at. And, while both versions offer DTS-HD audio, the Director's Cut has received a superior mix -- Darkness's rich basso voice will resonate throughout your home. Special features are nearly identical to the Ultimate Edition DVD, minus the DVD-ROM content. Regardless of version, this Blu-ray is a substantial upgrade in fidelity.To sum up, this is a spectacular disc for a not-quite-so-spectacular film. If you're new to the film, I would definitely consider a viewing before making a purchase, but if you have fond memories of ""Legend,"" this Blu-ray will be highly regarded in your collection.",N/A

1404925,"I have to say, going in, I'm no expert on horror flicks, and I don't typically go out of my way to see one. But Roger Corman's Sharktopus has a gut-level fascination that compelled me to see what it was about. The cover art reminds you of the 60s B-flicks of which Corman was such a staple of quick and prolific.S-11 is a shark/octopus hybrid created as a killing machine for the navy. Remember Barf in Spaceballs -- half man, half dog, I'm my own best friend; and in Matinee John Goodman picking up a rubber alligator, ""Manigator, Alliman...?"" You have to put the analytic critic in the back seat and just enjoy the ride. The sharktopus is a fascinating creation that fills the screen with surprisingly well-rendered graphics in and out of the water. The movie keeps you wanting to see more of the monster, if only to check out its moves. And the appearances aren't stingy like most monster movies.The story doesn't require too much analysis. Experimental beast loses it's control mechanism, going renegade. Most of the people will end up as shark-bait, so there isn't a surplus of characterization to the munchy morsels along the way. The mercenary and inventor's daughter who hunt down the beast don't exhibit the typically credible human emotions of fear around a morsel-munching shark that just as easily tentacles it's way on land as in the deep. It's a pretty wild ride with high body count and pretty graphic crunchy splatter effects, it that's your thing. Not appropriate for kids.

1306726,"A[...] I love Romantic Comedies!!  Especially ones shot in lovely foreign cities with beautiful landscapes and amazingly classic architecture.  Sophie (a name which has made quite the resurgence in recent years), played by the beautiful Amanda Seyfried is a fact checker for the New Yorker with the ambition of becoming a writer for the mag.  She is engaged to the passionate and easily distracted Victor (played enthusiastically by Gael Garcia Bernal), a soon to be restaurateur in New York.  The two embark on a pre-honeymoon trip to Italy to both meet suppliers for Victor's restaurant and to site-see together.  But guess what?  Victor and his passion for food has overshadowed Sophie and the sites of Italy.So what's a girl to do?  Go off alone and visit the old digs of the most tragic heroine of all love stories'- the home of Juliet Capulet.  Where love-lorn females from all over the world leave letters for Juliet and hope for an answer.  I think most of you know where the film goes after that - Sophie finds an old letter from the 50's and, under the guise of being one of ""Juliet's secretaries, ""has"" to write a response.  Her letter fuels a trip to find lost love, while giving our main characters a chance to find themselves...All romantics must see this film!  Yes it was cheesy (complete with scaling castle walls and white horses).  Yes it was predictable.  But it was also beautifully shot with likable characters.  And call me easy, but that makes it a must-see film.  I was fully engaged with the characters and their conflicts in this movie.  I appreciated the two versions of Sophie we got to see.  She was sweet and a little bit of a push-over at work and with her fianc&eacute;, but assertive and unshakable in her position with Charlie (played by Christopher Egan) , the overprotective grandson of Claire (Vanessa Redgrave looking quite striking) who wrote the letter from the 50's.  Can I just say how friggin beautiful Amanda Seyfried is?  She looks like she jumped out of a fairytale story with her blond hair and fabulous pout.Anyway, I believe that with romantic comedies you always know how it will end up, you simply must enjoy the ride, and Letters to Juliet is quite the pleasant ride of human characters and satisfying encounters.

542620,"I still remember the day I went to see this film in the theater.  My best friend was a huge fan of the video game series, and he integrated me into the obsession.  I went to see the film mostly for him.  He, being so devoted to the actual video games themselves, was disappointed in the vast difference in subject presented in the film.  It had varying similarities to the tone and texture of the video games, but it was wholly its own story and concept.  I was kind of in love with it, and I must admit that it has continued to grow on me over the years.  The film, while deeply rooted in the science fiction aspect of things, gets the bulk of its staying power from the very raw and human core of the film.  It contains the same level of character development that is so engrossing within the video games (that span hours of gameplay in order to truly connect you to the characters) but in a shorter time span and with slightly more intimate appeal.  The visual effects are stunning, and the action sequences come with a sharpness that elevates them above the bulk of animated films out there.  While the plot may seem rather straightforward, it isn't.  The core themes (which revolve mostly around the spiritual) make themselves known with a beautiful subtlety that gives the audience more reason to dive in for another viewing.  With beautiful imagery and an emotional heft to compliment it, `Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within' is certainly a notch above most it's competition.",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

So many human experiences are so candidly expressed and the Mancini soundtrack is, of course, perfect throughout. Julie Andrews is the stability in all the uproar around her; thank goodness for 'mental' Holly, who's awareness lends the strong shoulder much needed by her friend.

I've seen the movie several times over the years and I love it as much now as I did then because at the end of the day, I enjoy it for what it is. He wasn't going for an Oscar nomination and some movies are meant to be enjoyed as good clean fun which is EXACTLY what Cherry Moon is. Prince and Jerome Benton had terrific chemistry (Jerome is the splitting image of brother Terry Lewis). I didn't know this was Kristin Scott Thomas' first movie role - who knew! The father was a baddie that you wanted Christopher to beat (how dare he try to keep star crossed lovers apart even if Christopher started out trying to swindler her??!!) and if you were a true Prince fan, how could you not cry when Christopher died????? All in all, I think the reason this movie has such high ratings on Amazon is because it was reviewed by people who embraced the movie in the spirit in which Prince made it back in 1986. It was another opportunity for Prince disciples to worship at the altar of Prince, plain and simple !:)",N/A

Even though it's one that lets viewers know that Henry Crabbe will still be making steak-and-kidney pies, it's a wrap-up anyone who's invested in the first four series will want to see.Through it all, the conflicts with Fisher grow; the security jobs mean that Henry's sharp police instincts aren't generally wanted. This conflict provides a thread running through the last season--sometimes absurd, as in ""Squashed Tomatoes"" and ""Pork Pies,"" but more often dramatic. It gives Richard Griffiths one last chance to show that his food-loving character isn't a one-note joke.

Instead of acting it seemed like she was the character.  I was cheering for her to get her target because I felt for her so much.And her action scenes were jaw dropping.  The action kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.I love the beginning of the movie though it is heart breaking but there is a lot of action in it and quite entertaining.  And I am not a fan of action movies but this one really had a plot that I could follow.  And to a certain degree I can definitely relate to the feelings of the character.And I was comfortable with the love scenes.  They were not about raunchy sex but about how she has a void within her that needs to be filled with love and being connected and belonging to someone.  I love the scene where the boyfriend wants to learn about her and how she feels.  And her reaction really screams the theme of the story.And the cast they picked was awesome specifically for the Colombia scenes, it represented a group of Latins that are rarely shown to the world.

This is not anything powerful likeAmerican History XorThe Shawshank Redemption- you don't want to feel uncomfortable or low. There really is no real uplifting humor. No characters to really cheer for or like. Lots of arguing and depressing themes.This is a very unsettling dark film and I don't really mean that as a praise either. This is NOT a feel-good film; I don't mean just the tone and the theme, but the movie itself and the ending.If you watch the trailer for this movie, it gives the whole plot away. Seriously. (by the way, although the trailer makes it out to be this fast-paced thriller, it is definitely NOT. It's a very misleading trailer) If you're into the psychology of the characters, or trying to figure out what the director is trying to say, then there may still be some ""entertainment"" left for you to enjoy.The ending feels quite of a cop-out. It seems like the writers didn't know how to end it. I do get what they tried to do with the connection and the whole message about the bee and the noise, but I do feel cheated sitting through that whole film and not know what would happen to the characters next. It just leaves it too hanging and unsatisfying.It's a little ridiculous and hard to believe that De Niro, the parole officer, on his way to retirement - and a veteran - knowing fully well he should not be talking to the convict's wife in the first place, still involves himself with her in that manner. I wish the writers would have thought of something better because I think he gave in way too easily just so SOMETHING could finally happen in the film. (I mean, who would even trust eating a raw egg from a convict's wife?! What if that was poisoned?! Hello?)People will love it or hate this film. I think for the former to happen, you would have to really sit down and really listen to all the dialogue, and watch it more than once carefully. I think on an entertainment level, it fails. I think viewing it a second time and trying to think deeper about the psychology of the characters is where it may, or may not, get interesting; but that's more of what the audience will have to fill-in and not exactly what the movie itself will show to the audience clearly.It feels a little TV-drama to me with lots of talking heads back and forth in the office or prison. To me, it was a little distracting that the film used major stars because for some reason, I couldn't help watch the film the whole time without thinking I'm just watching De Niro and Norton on screen. I mean, De Niro was just De Niro. Edward Norton put some more effort into his character, but I still couldn't help it but see Stone's character as Edward Norton just acting. (When I was watching American History X, the story and dialogue was so engaging, I lost the Norton distraction and just saw that film of him as the character). I mean, it definitely does take a veteran cast to perform and sell those dialogues without coming out too cheesy or unbelievable.The extras on the DVD is really lousy. I'm surprised this DVD doesn't even have a director's commentary because it really could have used one, and I would have been interested to hear it.The first time I watched it, I hated the film. It grew on me the second time I watched it. Overall, I give it a 6/10. It's probably more interesting to analyze the theme or characters of this film than to watch the movie again. It is not your typical mindless Hollywood film, but at the same time, it's not a good source of ""entertainment"" either. It is a depressing film.Besides the performance, the main entertainment of this film is really in the dialogues. This movie is for you if you're into paying attention carefully to every dialogue and not so much on the plot; you'll notice subtle things like reoccurring lines like De Niro's character saying ""You don't think I'll do it"" in the beginning of the film when he's young (they sure found a good look alike!) and near the end.",Stone

The only problem I had with the casting was Frank Welker performing the voice of Scooby.  He does a good job, but there is something about it that doesn't click like Neil Fanning's. Nick Palatas shocked me with his performance of Shaggy.  A few spots it seems a little forced, but as a whole he does a great job becoming a very tough character! Kate Melton and Hayley Kiyoko are wonderful as Daphne and Velma and interact very well together.  A very good pair to play a female team. Robbie Amell was a decent Freddy, but he just kinda didn't fit the Freddy look.  His facial structure, build, just is off.  His hair color is distracting (but if you've seen Curse of the Lake Monster, maybe we will see the evolution of the bleach blonde :) But still, I can live with his part.The plot of the movie is very interesting, it caught my attention more than I had expected and it really shows how Mystery Inc. come to grow close to each other.  The ending, however, kind of does away with everything that was built up throughout the movie.  Its just weak and stupid, even for Scooby Doo, I'm sure little kids would even be like ""Seriously?  This is what it all amounts to?""Overall, I do like this movie.  They kept it sweet and simple while keeping the magic of Scooby Doo.  This movie has also led to Curse of the Lake Monster and I do believe the cast was contracted for 3 movies, so I'm sure we can expect another.  I'm very excited, I was hoping for more Scooby movies and these straight to DVD/TV special premiers are doing exceptionally well, so I'm hoping it spawns a more high-budget project.",Scooby-Doo!

946312,"The story in ""The Island"" is quite intriguing. It depicts a future in which human beings, very wealthy human beings, order clones of themselves with a corporation that grows them in a vast underground city. The clones are clueless, grown into adults and then memories implanted, and they are told that a certain kind of ""contamination"" has killed everything on the planet and that aside from the underground sanctuary, there is the one last place that is still safe: the island. For reasons unknown, not everyone can go to the island and so every day there is a lottery in which someone's number is pulled to ""go to the island."" The clones dont know they are clones and they really believe this to be the reality.The movie is about slowly deconstructing that fantasy, that almost utopian future and revealing some of the ugly truth inherent in the human condition. The humans depicted in this future are so obsessed with youth and living forever, that they have deliberately turned a blind eye to what is happening to other human beings in their society. There is a powerful scene in the movie where a pregnant woman is supposed ot go to the island, but of course that is not going to happen. She gives birth and immediately after is given an injection and killed. The business woman has her baby in arm and watches the woman die, before delivering the baby to the parents that ordered it. The new mother that holds the baby is the genetic original of the clone that was just killed. The business woman then closes the deal by offering to bring them the ""termination papers"" of their ""insurance policy"".The storyline about how the two protagonists uncover the truth is fascinating and just the whole premise of this movie is very smart and thought provoking - because in a way it is not a very too far future from ours.However, while this movie started strongly, it ended on a rather slow note. Of course not literally  - which is precisely what the problem with this movie is. I feel as if there is almost a clear division in this movie and that it can be divided into two parts. The first part entices us quite intelligently into this fascinating future and there is a lot of potential that is set up here. But the second part, which goes into overdrive, ends up being a lot of bang bang, super action, one long car chase scene with crashes and explosions. There is a pause and then the quality of the film emerges again. But as soon as the car chase scenes a la Michael Bay begin, everything goes downhill. I really wish they had continued on that strong beginning instead of allowing it to fizzle into mediocrity. The ending was pretty good though and connected the beginning with it.Despite the one short coming I think this movie is quite underrated in the message it attempts to convey and the quality with respect to *how* it was done. The actors truly inhabit the roles they are portraying, and so they are believable. The chemistry between McGreggor and Johansson is great and I thought the cinematography and soundtrack were amazing, truly conveying the mood of the movie about a future not too far from ours.",N/A

1405131,"I concur wholeheartedly with the other reviewers on the steady decline of PBS. It should be noted however that the commercial networks are declining even faster. The wonder is that the producers, technical staff, and cast of Any Human Heart were able to create such a masterpiece in today's marketplace. It surely ranks up there withThe Tudors: The Complete Seriesas a rare feat of fine art in an age of media materialism. I'm happy to see that Any Human Heart has been nominated for Best Drama by the Broadcasting Press Guild Awards. In my local cable outlet, the last episode of Any Human heart was actually broadcast during the Academy Awards. It was no contest; the gross indulgence of the Hollywood moguls paled in comparison. OnlyThe King's Speechlent any credibility to the proceedings.I also want to bring everyone's attention to the utterly glorious soundtrack for this series by the British composer Dan Jones ([...]). This production could have been destroyed by lesser music, but Dan's composition easily transports the viewer/listener into the sublime dimension intended by the writer and director. The whole series is seen through the eyes of Logan Mountstewart as he is approaching the imminent end of his long life, and the musical background captures that poignancy perfectly. I certainly hope PBS makes this soundtrack available on CD.",Masterpiece Classic: Any Human Heart

1505638,"I don't know if the cast only had the locations for a short time or if they had other time concerns, but the normally rapid-fire dialogue of ""The Guild"" seems to turn into almost inaudible auctionspeak in the first few season five episodes. I was worried that the cast had lost interest and was just ""phoning it in,"" but I'm glad to say that my paranoia was not justified. Once the major plotlines are established the rhythm is found, the show seems to blast off. Maybe the reason for the hyperactive pace is that Season 5 is positively *crammed* full of cameo appearances. Some of these you may expect and some you will definitely not. It almost seems like spoilers to list them all, so I'll avoid that in case you wait for the DVD releases to watch the whole season for some reason. All of your favorite (main) characters are present and accounted for, but this season they mostly operate on their own. This is another aspect of season five that is off-putting at first, but Felicia Day proves once again that she can write ""geeks with hearts of gold"" and manages to bring the Guild together for a stunning finale.Most of the drama of this season (and a lot of the laughs) comes for the ever-developing relationship between Codex (Day) and Tink (Amy Okuda). These two are a blast to watch as a pair. Tink is her usual acerbic self, but finds herself sharing secrets with Codex, only to have Codex light the road to relationship hell with her good intentions. The plot with Codex and The Game's designer is less interesting, besides serving to move the drama forward later in the arc. However, as a writer Day tends to be generous with ""the good stuff"" and uses Codex mostly as a rallying point anyway, so this is a non-issue.Vork (Jeff Lewis) teams up with Bladezz (Vincent Caso) in what can only be described as a scam to make money off of Bladezz's sublimely ridiculous internet commercial from Season Four. I like Caso's character because he never seems to learn his lesson. Any time he admits fault is largely by accident, and yet he remains extremely likeable (many fans protested the virtually unknown Caso being fake-ousted from the Guild in Season One). Not much can be said about Jeff Lewis that hasn't already been said. He's just an incredibly funny guy. It must have been really hard to not put Lewis and Parikh together again this season, and I understand the decision to cut back on that pairing, but I don't like it. I'm a greedy fan and I want more.Clara (Robin Thorsen) gets a solo plot involving a Steam Punk cosplay troop. For what seems like a pretty minor subplot, it pays off in a big way. Clara is definitely something special and I kind of wish she had a another chance to play off the others like she did with Okuda in Season Four. Her childlike sense of fun and self-centered cavorting do clash very well against the cold and haughty cosplayers, though. I'm not sure if this was intended, but Clara has that brilliant ""Homer Simpson"" appeal. She's a lousy parent, she's not smart, but she finds so much joy in things it's impossible not to like her.If I had to pick a lamentable subplot it would be Zaboo's (Sandeep Parikh) ""seat-savers"" arc. It served as a framework to bring in some incredible cameos, and Parikh played Zaboo's Kurtzian insanity *perfectly*, but I really missed the good-natured Zaboo of earlier seasons. Is the arc hilarious? Yes. But I really wanted to see Zaboo grow as a person and come to the conclusions he makes through introspection and development as a grown man instead of rushed lack of interest brought on by ultra-fandom. Day always gets the characters where they need to be, but in this case it feels sort of like a shortcut. I will say it was amazing to see Parikh steal scene after scene no matter who was placed in front of him.Overall this is another great season of ""The Guild."" If I seem to be too hard on this little webseries it's because I don't regard it any lower than the scripted network shows with millions of dollars in their budget. Felicia Day and company are simply excellent at what they do and deserve praise as well as honest criticism. This season sort of feels like the end of ""The Guild,"" but let's hope that I'm wrong and there's more to come from these talented people.***EDIT: I'm not being a doomsayer, it just seems like the end of this season could be considered the ""Series Finale"" because of where it puts the characters (especially Codex). I'd personally love to see plenty more stories with these characters.",The Guild: Season 5

483243,"Probably one of the worst movies ever executed using a big Hollywood budget.""Heaven's Gate"" may be a classic compared to this car crash. The problem was they began shooting without a coherent script, resulting in a disjointed mess with genuine menace, but no real focus and not a single likable character.There was no amount of editing magic or special effects that could fix it if the story on paper was already this bad.The best actor on the production played a character killed off in the first 15 minutes of the film. The others, even Angela Bassett and the gorgeous Robin Tunney, are at best miscast, especially James Spader, who pulls duty in this film as a buff action hero, a role completely outside of his scope.It might be more accurate to say that the characters as written could never be played by actors of any caliber at all. This is just bad storytelling from the opening fade-in.One note: if they had released it with the original ending (viewable as one of the extras) it would have gone down in history as the biggest downer ending ever put on film.Skip this one.

A NY moves into a New England house,with a sordid past. Not surprisingly,that past has never left.Macabre and frightening things soon happen. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS  We get not only some really good gore,such as a bloody killing with a poker,a struggle with a bat,very bloody throat slashing/decapitation,and ultimately severed limbs and guts all about during a flashback, but this has a genuine creepy and frightening atmosphere, which you will not get most of the time in this genre. Classic horror film and haunted house flick musical score. The editing is as problematic as ever, like the rest of Fulci's catalog;pointless cuts and uneven structure. To the point of irritating. Dialogue and acting are(again like all of other Fulci's films)so bad it's hilarious, but who watches these movies for that anyway??? Only the editing is the flaw that bothers me.Once again, Blue Underground has a done a terrific job on this BD release. Presented in it's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1,anamorphic, with an English DTS-HD 2.0 track as well as the original Italian mono, with English subtitles. Audio is clear and sharp, no problems.

The first interview with the lovely and still beautiful to-this-day Catriona MacColl and Paolo Malco is fun watch as they give their recollections and commentary.

931278,"I've read many of the reviews before purchasing this movie and they all say the same thing as does the back of the movie cover, so I'll put it into the short version for those who are trying to make sense of this.A Yankee trooper sometime between the Battle of the Wilderness and the Spotsylvania battles of 1864 in Virginia discovers that his horse has given birth to a colt. The sergeant wants him to kill the colt, but the trooper just can't bring himself to do so, and the colt somehow attracts admirers from that company, including the lieutenant that commands the company, who doesn't want that colt to get killed. A couple of times, the baby horse almost does get killed, even by some troops on the opposing side that manage to run off with the colt. The Yankee Michigan trooper gallops off and rescues the colt, even though the sergeant threatens to turn him in for ""desertion"" while doing so.At one point in the movie, a company of Confederate troops ambushes the Yankee cavalry as they attempt to cross the rushing waters of a flooded creek. The lieutenant is killed in this action and the colt is trapped among the rocks around the rising water. As both sides look on incredulously, the Yankee trooper rushes out to free the colt and a Confederate sergeant immediately helps him out as well. But some idiot trigger-happy Confederate soldier at the end kills the Yankee trooper, much to the disgust and indignation of the Confederate sergeant who was just coming back to his lines after helping the Yankee with the baby horse. So the ending was quite tragic, and I wasn't expecting that to happen, but it was a good movie anyway.I only wish that this movie had some CAPTIONING to go with it.

1423059,"The three films comprising the Zeitgeist series by Peter Joseph are extraordinary in their dissection of the modern world as a collective myth whose core is money.  Money, in this paradigm, isn't simply ""the root of all evil': it's the root of the world's entire social fabric.  Peter Joseph reduces money to its lowest common denominator: debt.  According to Joseph, money equals debt in a purely one-to-one relationship; and exists for no other reason than to accrue debt.  Since money is the core of the modern world, and money equals debt, it follows that debt is likewise the core of every modern society.  This world created by money - out of thin air, as Joseph contends - can exist only if the people of the world accept debt as their one and only way of life - their very reason for being; and, as a corollary, scarcity as their inevitable plight.  And once they've accepted debt as their rightful due, they must do one thing and one thing only: submit their labor in exchange for wages.  So far so good; but then the reasoning begins to get a little fuzzy.A Utopian world is envisioned by Joseph and the creators of something called The Venus Project - a Utopia unlike anything ever conceived - although he insists there is nothing Utopian about their vision.  This new world would be built entirely on two pillars.  First, people must change their way of thinking, their way of seeing themselves vis-a-vis the world and others, and, accordingly, their way of behaving.  The assumption is made that this feat - greater than any feat humanity has ever undertaken - is within the realm of human possibility.  The second pillar upon which this world would stand is Technology.  Joseph contends that Technology offers the possibility of forever eradicating virtually all of the ills which currently keep three quarters of the earth's population in a state of abject misery.Though I don't consider myself trapped in the ""old"" way of thinking or looking at the world, I do nevertheless have serious reservations about the feasibility of achieving such an unbridled state of benevolence and prosperity - not because of the understandable resistance of the current social paradigm to any change and especially a change of such sweeping magnitude; but because of the two cornerstones of this bold new world.  For one thing, technology has always proven itself a double-edged sword.  You can argue that's because technology has always fallen prisoner to those whose only concern is the preservation of the moneyed world; but since technology has always been used to maintain the status quo, the theory Peter Joseph puts forth has never been tested.  We simply don't know if technology really does lend itself to working harmoniously with the natural world - or if, by its very nature, it can only exploit the world's resources; nor, for that matter, do we know if any manner of technology can safeguard human societies from the inevitable ravages of nature.  For another thing, the ""nature versus nurture"" controversy has never been satisfactorily resolved - notwithstanding the assertion of some of the experts interviewed that the concept itself is bogus.  Joseph contends that once the myth born of money ceases to influence people's thinking and behavior, they will cease acting negatively toward one another and toward the earth; because, once all their needs are met, they would have no reason to continue their negative behavior - a contention almost impossible to prove or disprove.  I essentially agree with Peter Joseph that The Law, as it was conceived and as we know it, functions almost entirely to preserve the status quo - most especially, property rights - and, consequently, does almost nothing to make life better for the great mass of people; but I cannot agree with his rendering of humans as being conditioned solely by their society.  Reason dictates that it's as likely to be the other way around: that the kind of society humans repeatedly find themselves in may be the product of universal human traits and not merely the sinister machinations of first a priestly then a knightly and finally a mercantile caste bent upon exploiting their fellow man, as Joseph contends.Almost every rendering of pre-history pre-supposes that the earliest humans would have gravitated toward the concept of the supernatural in their attempts to make sense of their world - and that's why they fell victim to all manner of creation myths.  But there would have been nothing in their experience to suggest magical beings as the cause of natural phenomena.  They could see lightening, they could hear thunder, they could feel wind; just because these things posed a threat does not mean the earliest humans would have concluded gods to have been the cause.  So while I readily accept Joseph's implication that the creation myths were foisted on the mass of people by a priestly caste, I think we have to look deeper to discover why these myths took hold of people's minds as they did.  People didn't - and still don't - need creation myths to make sense of their world or to render their world more manageable.  It had to have been something other than fear of the unknown to prompt people to abandon their common sense explanations of natural phenomena and take on a mythology completely alien to their experience of their world.  Best guess is that they found something in the myths they could use to their advantage - and why not?  There's nothing to indicate that people were ever disposed to look favorably upon others outside their immediate tribal setting, even if ""Zeitgeist"" does postulate that that's exactly how people would have lived prior to the creation of money.Ironically, Peter Joseph comes very close to creating his own mythology when he blindly accepts that, given the optimal circumstances, people would gladly, even eagerly, accept others as fellow travelers on a journey of discovery; and would willingly share all the wonders and resources they find on their journey.  I sincerely hope he's right; but I fear he's wrong.  People gravitate too easily toward the more selfish modes of social interaction to ever imagine that they would willingly abandon their present way of life for one more altruistic; there's very little in human history to suggest that a majority of people would even wish to live in the kind of world Joseph envisions.  Then there's one final aspect of this entire Venus Project that's more than just a little troubling: who would coordinate everything necessary to make this new society work?  Joseph implies it would be the task of scientists; but given their penchant for playing ""God,"" can scientists be trusted to work entirely for the benefit of humanity?  Have scientists used their understanding of natural laws to create a staggering array of destructive devices entirely because they came under the domination of moneyed interests?  Or have they been a bit too eager to create anything, regardless how devastating it is, simply because they can?  This is clearly yet another unknown variable; and because it remains unknown, it would be foolhardy to blindly turn the world over to the scientists to run.",Zeitgeist: Moving Forward
853556,"There are so many levels that Batman: The Animated Series works on that it is difficult if not impossible to sum them up in any review. However, I would like to try. First, the show gave Batman an aesthetic that was at once pleasing to children and to adults. Gotham City is a dark and dirty urban distopia not unlike Tim Burton's noir-ish portrayal of the Dark Knight's home, albeit in the animated series it is trimmed up into a classy art deco design. As is well known, the series animators were inspired by Max Fleischer's Superman cartoons, which are themselves classic. Their appreciation of older animation shows through and yet at no point dominates Batman: The Animated Series. Instead, watching these cartoons is like watching a whole tradition come to life. We see Burton's films, the 1930s early backdrop, a modern Gotham, art deco designs, Max Fleischer's Superman work. The series deserved its many awards for fine animation.However, there is something else that needs to be touched upon: the story lines are simply brilliant. Although this began as a kid's cartoon, it brought with it an immensely complex and compelling level of psychological depth. It is not too much to say that Dini, Timm, and company effectively raised a number of existentially big questions in the series, ranging from the nature of friendship, the trauma of memory, betrayal, jealousy, loss, and above all justice and the possibility of redemption. I think that Batman: The Animated Series is not far removed from a form of moral pedagogy. This is particularly the case on volume 2, which has two of my favorite episodes on it, Robin's Reckoning (parts 1 and 2).  The issue of not letting your feelings outweigh your sense of justice is a very big theme, and the writers did a brilliant job of making this compelling. I treasure this series; my girlfriend and I have watched its many episodes many times and, above all, I look forward to sharing it someday with my own children. I do believe that this is the finest compliment that I can give it.",Batman: The Animated Series - Volume 2

647531,"After watching ""The Kings Speech"", I dug out ""The Queen"" from my movie collection. I had enjoyed watching it before but enjoyed it even more the second time. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair were phenomenal. I didn't really care for Alex Jennings as Prince Charles but then again, I don't really care for Prince Charles. Prince Philip was very well played by James Cromwell although portrayed as harsh, cruel, and uncaring.The movie takes place in the weeks after Princess Diana's accidental death in 1997 and intersperses actual news footage throughout. A newly elected Tony Blair immediately gives a speech but the royal family isolate themselves in Balmoral and refuse to acknowledge Diana's death publicly. Queen Elizabeth believes in handling everything privately, Tony Blair, newly elected, tries to pursuade her that the people want more. Prince Charles, played rather sympathetically in this film, also tries to influence the Queen but she does not agree. The press begin to harshly criticize the royal family, the public becomes angry and begin speaking out against the royal family, and Tony Blair continues to plead with the Queen to reconsider and 'be there' for her people.Mirren is fantastic as the dignified yet somewhat vulnerable Queen. The part where the family finally return to England and walk amongst the flowers and notes left outside the castle, many of the notes expressing harsh feelings towards the monarchy, gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes. As well, the included footage of Diana's brother's actual speech was incredibly emotional. The Queen finally speaks publicly but I am very curious as to how close this speech is to the real one and plan to google it as soon as I finish this review.""The Queen"" is an extremely well-done, gripping, emotional and thought-provoking film. Blair once again is portrayed very positively but one wonders what really transpired during those weeks since many of the conversations between Blair and the Queen would have been private. It's also interesting to note that no real footage of the royal family where they can be seen is included.To me, a sign of a good movie is when you are left wanting to know more about the events depicted in it. And that is how I felt at the end.",The Queen

And the problem there was that he walked just fine ''on the next day''. But it shouldn't have happened. He like everybody else forgot that he should walk slow. But that's the only thing. The special effects are outstanding. The only thing I didn't like was the final explosion. The flames looked very cheap. And bugs were looking very great. The main actors are very cool. The story is great. And the point is not to go deep into how it all happened but as what will happen now and then. How to survive it. And that actually was very smart. I loved the humor and there were no such movie about bugs, that was so much fun since ''Tremors''. You must checkout these movies.

He finds a way to pose as a genetically perfect person so he can pursue his dream of being an astronaut, but a murder investigation stands the chance of exposing him...Although competently made, the film suffers from being overly-preachy -- based (intentionally?) on a misunderstanding of eugenics -- and in itself has a couple of gaping plot holes.

700483,"Before Tom Cruise was known as a crazed, jumping individual (anyone remember his appearance on ""Oprah""?) and after his breakthrough performance in 1986's ""Top Gun"" Tom appeared in a line of successful Hollywood films making him the biggest box office attraction of his generation. ""Cocktail"" is one of the films that solidified Cruise as the most popular male star of the late eighties and early nineties.I hadn't watched ""Cocktail"" in over ten years, but recently purchased the film on DVD. I completely forgot how dated the movie is; everything from the big, curly female hairdos to the tacky eighties music score and songs epitomozes how much the film was of its era. Still, if you can get past those minor issues the film is quite good. Tom gives a convincing performance as a young man who comes to New York City with dreams of becoming successful in the business world. After failing miserably in college (while bartending) Brian Flannigan (Cruise's character) decides to go to Jamaica with his best friend, make some quick cash, and open his own bar in the Big Apple. There's a nice love story here and Tom has never looked better, especially in the Jamaican scenes with his amazing tan.The film grossed an amazing $80,000,000 on a $6,000,000 budget and is now known for some of the songs used in the film, tracks performed by the Beach Boys and Bobby McFarrin.In recent years Touchstone Pictures has released ""Cocktail"" in a  two DVD set with Tom's ""The Color of Money"" film from 1986, a picture he starred in with Paul Newman.",N/A

773676,"This is a very strange movie. Which is neither an insult nor a compliment.It's set at Christmas. In New Orleans. So no snow. And it's done in the style later called ""film noir,"" so there's lots of rain and shadows (rather than snow).It features former kiddie musical sensation Deanna Durbin. But she doesn't sing much. And she's no longer a kiddie. She's the femme fatale, the troubled woman who may or may not--I won't give it away--bring doom to one or more men.There are no holiday songs, although it does feature two very lovely songs: ""(I'll Be Loving You) Always"" and ""Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year."" The former is a classic song of romantic dedication. But in this movie, it's about a woman loving a wastrel, as they used to call guys what was no good.Gene Kelly plays the wastrel. (Are you getting the weirdness vibe yet?) And Gale Sondergaard, famous for playing dragon ladies, is Kelly's mother, and she is formidable during the moments she isn't being sweetly maternal (which are few).There's a tricky story structure in which a soldier who's been jilted meets Durbin. Durbin's story of loving a Bad Guy gives the solider a lot to chew on when it comes to love and romance. And that's the basic kick of the story: a young and inexperienced man hears a story that's so far beyond his ken that he grows up just by hearing it.But it's all very tricky. Durbin's story gets told in flashback and party backwards: she tells the sordid stuff first, then goes back to the sweet falling-in-love bits, which then seem foreboding rather than sweet. And basically her life then gets worse and worse--which brings the audience up to the present day, when the Durbin character is basically what used to be called a ""hostess""--a woman who danced with the customers to induce them to buy watered-down expensive drinks which allowed the bar to cash in at the male customer's expense.So it's not much of a Christmas story. (It was released in July, so the producers knew it was not holiday fare.) It's a dark romance.All this is fine. It's all kind of crazily, darkly enjoyable.And since Durbin was one of Universal's biggest star, director Robert Siodmak clearly had a decent budget: there's a Christmas mass, an orchestral hall which is shot in full during what seems to be an actual concert (or reasonable facsimile), and there are two- or three-story sets in which the camera follows the actors down and around complicated stairs and such. Clearly, the studio was spending money, and the director was having some fun fooling around with the camera.I have only two complaints. One is that although Deanna Durbin was a reasonably attractive person, she was not Movie Star Beautiful. Her face has a pudgy quality from most angles--except for one. That one angle is terrific: Durbin looks like a sweet little sister type with quite a bit of extra sparkle. But they only use that angle a couple of times.My second and larger complaint is that the movie uses Wagner's Liebestod, and that sets us up to think that at least one romantic couple will end up in a deadly embrace, and I won't spoil it, just say it's not quite that way. They seem to have softened the ending.In short, this is a very UNUSUAL movie, to say the least. But it's pretty well done. Is it worth what it costs to get something that's been more out-of-print than in? It's up to you. If you like truly offbeat material, this is your thing.But chances are most people will never see this movie.",N/A

1393533,"When I picked this up I was expecting a run-of-the-mill children's animated film, complete with songs, cheesy jokes, and the usual.  From the second I started watching, though, I knew I was in for a completely different experience.  By the end of the film, I was completely blown away.  I mean, I was expecting something on the level of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" but instead I got the animated version of Lord of the Rings - you know, if Gandalf and company were CGI owls.Speaking of the plot, this is the quintessential ""hero's tale"" that's been told and re-told about a million times.  That being said, if a film isn't compelling enough then this sort of story can end up feeling stale and re-hashed.  So, does ""Legend of the Guardians"" succeed or fail?  Well, I feel like it's a success.  I never felt bored the whole time I was watching.  Even though a lot of familiar elements and themes are present (hero's journey, family members betraying each other, evil overlords, etc.), there were also a lot of times where I thought to myself ""Oh, I bet that this will happen"", but it never did!  They managed to avoid enough of the cliches to keep the film from feeling too predictable.  My only complaints about the actual story are the fact that some things remain unexplained, and the film engaging in obvious sequel-baiting (something I'm not fond of since they can't really guarantee that sequel will ever come).  Overall, though, I'm pretty pleased.So, I've already established that I enjoyed the film greatly - but I'm an adult.  Even though ""Legend of the Guardians"" is marketed as a children's film, parents might want to exercise caution in allowing their children to see this.  It's fairly violent (but not gory), and even though they try to throw in some brief comic relief, it has an overall atmosphere of seriousness and dread.  I couldn't really give you a definitive age range, but parents should know whether or not their children are too sensitive for a film like this.Lastly, I need to mention why I've only given this film four stars instead of five.  It has nothing to do with the movie itself and more to do with the set-up of the DVD.  There are several annoying features that really irked me.  First off, when you first turn on the DVD player, if you don't hit the menu button immediately various trailers will start playing.  You CANNOT skip these!  If you try to hit the menu button during a trailer, it won't do anything.  You also cannot use the ""skip to next scene"" button.  So, you've either got to turn off the player and try again or wait through all the trailers (and there are a lot).  That's just cruel and inexcusable.  My second complaint has to do with the DVD options.  The only two options you get are ""play movie"" and ""Language"".  They didn't even have the courtesy to give us a scene select option.  Nor are there any special features of any kind.  I know some people don't care about special features, but I like watching the ""making-of"" documentaries and personal interviews with the cast and crew.  It would've been nice to see that here.  Well, anyway, those are my only real complaints.Despite the minor irritations with the DVD itself, I still recommend this film.  Among hideously vapid movies like ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"", ""Legend of the Guardians"" stands out as a quality film that should not be missed.  Even if you're not entirely sure, just rent it first and give it a try.  You might like it as much as I did!",N/A

342636,"I simply can't comprehend the negative reviews this frankly GREAT B movie has generated. Either these reviewers have unbelievably quiet personal lives, or FRESH HORSES hits too close to home for them to enjoy it. Gratefully, my own experience like the one depicted here, is far enough in the past that I can simply love this movie with ennui. The script, far from ""incoherent,"" is stunning. It's the story of a young man on the fast track in life, whose entire value system is overturned when he falls in love with a girl, Jewell, the victim of child abuse and neglect, unlike anyone he has ever been exposed to before. He sees in her a beautiful and talented, unschooled intelligence. He feels compelled to save her from the fate into which she is careening. Little does he know that before he can save her, he must destroy all his own prospects which he has previously taken for granted as though predestined for success.FRESH HORSES explores the invisible American caste system, the difference between education and intelligence, the connection between social standing and friendship, and the dichotomy of masculine integrity. I am in no way exaggerating when I say, it's Dickensian in its scope.Several of the negative reviews site ""bad acting."" I'd love to know what that means. These are all talented, young actors (at the time FRESH HORSES was made) many of whom have become household names. Here's Ben Stiller as Andrew McCarthy's ""bad angel,"" who introduces him to an edgy new lifestyle, then deserts him when he becomes immersed in it. Here's Viggo Mortensen, the first time I was ever aware of him, as Jewel's husband, dangerously underestimated in his shrewd, street-wise intelligence.I do love the script so much I wish we could see a young Montgomery Cliff and Marilyn Monroe in the lead roles. But I wonder if Marilyn, as spectacular as she looks, could have pulled off the scene with the boldness Molly Ringwald offers when, as Jewel, she breaks up Andrew McCarthy's party in the abandoned shack where they previously kept house?This was a difficult and powerful role for Molly Ringwald. In my opinion, it's her greatest performance to date. If you don't want your ideas about what you're doing with your life to be challenged, you may prefer to avoid this noir cautionary tale.

It is about truth and forgiveness.Lisa Cudrow is amazingly hateful in this movie so you know she plays her role as the scorned ex-wife to the hilt. It is a lovely ensemble piece and although it doesn't dive deeply into the emotional reasons behind all of the anger, it does reveal enough of the back story to help the audience understand that the guilt we harbor over our action(s) or the anger the drives us can sometimes cause the life journey we are on to come to a painfully slow and screeching halt.  Life cannot continue on its course until the tracks are cleared to move forward. In the end, love has not so much to do with it as the other matters of truth and forgiveness.

Theseus (Henry Cavill) needs to find the Epirus Bow before King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) finds it and uses it to set the Titans free to decimate all mankind. Theseus will get help from a virgin oracle and the Gods themselves to accomplish this mission.I like the director Tarsem Singh. His first outing ""The Cell"" was a decent script with a great look. His follow-up ""The Fall"" was a great script with a great look. ""Immortals"" seems more the child of the producers. It looks as though they were trying to capitalize on the success of their earlier ""300."" The overall look is very similar but I have to imagine Singh had a big hand in this. The costumes and set design are extensions of his earlier efforts. This movie looks great. Every shot is a feast for the eyes. The effects are seamless and the slow motion violence is really cool. Seeing heads explode like this is.....unique.Cavill has a good, heroic screen presence. Rourke plays a great villain. He is so casual about killing it made my skin crawl. Freida Pinto as Phaedra is a real knockout. Stephen Dorf was good as Stavros but he seemed out of place somehow. John Hurt and Stephen McHattie were good in their small-ish rolls. One review I read complained about the slowness of it. I can't say I disagree but, at the same time, I wasn't getting fidgety so it mustn't have been too bad. This is an epic, myth based movie. Tarsem Singh does a lot to bring the sense of myth to the look and feel of it all. I'm chomping at the bit to see his upcoming ""Mirror Mirror.""I cannot say I liked this quite as much as ""300"" but this is still a heck of a ride.

It's kind of like that.  It's like an episode of The World's Dumbest Criminals or The World's Dumbest Hostages.  The ending somehow doesn't feel satisfying, because everything that comes before it just gets lamer and lamer.  It is well-filmed and directed, though.  I give three stars for Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, and the daughter who looks like a young Sasha Grey.  And I will continue to support these first releases on streaming video, mainly because I'm too lazy to get dressed and drive to a sticky movie theater with people chomping on popcorn and slurping up soft drinks out of livestock buckets.",N/A

The Silver Screen version contains so many skips in the bridge scene that it's unwatchable. This print is not pristine but the few skips are not during dialog and are hardly noticeable. My advice for Marx Brothers fans is to buy the Siver Screen for the other films and to replace Animal Crackers with this version.,N/A

249263,"This film, which I first saw on the large screen in the 'seventies, is one of a rash of tales of the bizarre that emerged, it seems to me, with ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) and was followed by ""The Omen,"" ""Harvest Home,"" and the ""The Exorcist,"" among others (They were perhaps intended to take the public's minds off of the madness of the 'sixties, including several nasty wars, student protests, and the energy crunch). To me, ""The Other"" surpasses its contemporary fright-flicks, for two principal reasons: acting and cinematography.The acting honours go primarily to Uta Hagen, the phenomenal actress of the Broadway theatre, who plays the grandmother of the twins with sincerity and grace. Her performance, which is truly moving, lifts what might have been a good but run-of-the-mill horror film into the realm of the extraordinary. Similarly, the casting of the twins (Chris and Martin Udvarnoky) was inspired. These were no smart-alec Hollywood brats; instead, they were natural, believable boys, who are consequently convincing in their roles. Their personas of normality, in fact, contribute immensely to the eerie atmosphere of the film.The cinematography is especially to be commended. The apparent normalcy of the setting initially reassures the viewer, who becomes gradually unsettled and--almost unawares--chilled, as the tale of horror unfolds. The pastoral setting of New England of the 1930s exudes tranquility--fields of alfalfa, whitewashed fences, sunflowers tilting against an old red barn--a feeling of comfort that is increasingly disturbed by nightmarish visions: birds of ill-omen, dark root-cellars, and upturned pitchforks. The old-fashioned iron rooster weathervane, which at first conveyed a sense of rural wellbeing, whirls violently in the hurricane that ravages the landscape.""The Other,"" the script of which was written by the author of the novel, Thomas Tryon, accomplishes most of the horror offstage, as it were; the film was produced in an era when it was thought unnecessary to drench the audience in blood and guts. Therefore, it will probably not be appreciated by viewers who enjoy the in-your-face genre of horror films. But for those who appreciate the subtleties of suggestion, ""The Other"" represents a rich--if macabre--feast for the imagination.P.S. Do not read the blurb on the back of the DVD--as another viewer has suggested--or watch the trailers before you watch the film. They give the entire show away. Do, however, read Mr Tryon's novel afterwards, if the book is available. It was, as I recall, riveting.",The Other VHS
1411036,"I was expecting a slap-stick comedy from the likes of Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman but I was pleasantly surprised. The Switch is actually a decent movie (although it does carry the heavy cliches).Aniston is a single middle-aged woman was has no prospects of getting married yet she wants to have a baby. She decides to get a man to donate his sperm for her to have a baby on her own. Patrick Wilson is only too happy to participate.Bateman is her friend from forever ago, and he isn't quite sure her plan is the best idea.After getting drunk at her party, he accidentally spills Wilson's ""donation"" and makes The Switch.7 years go by with Aniston moving away, having the baby and Bateman getting on with his life. When Aniston returns with her son, Bateman begins to notice they have similar quirks and characteristics. (He doesn't have the memory of that drunk party decision)The cliches in this movie range from the cute kid who acts like an adult to the climactic reveal of strong feelings at the most improper time.

Neil's voice sounds great, and when he's in close-up, I forget for a minute what an abyssmally crappy DVD this is.When I see the full stage, I'm treated to what I can only call a half-assed middle-school version of Cirque de Soleil, with two somewhat amateurish hacks performing cutesy little tricks and other mild contortions.

101812,"Viewed: 12/08Rate: 612/08: All the President's Men is rather an ordinary real-life detective movie that is buoyed enough with good performances. I can't honestly say that I was enthralled because it wasn't that exciting. Surely, there are good moments in the chase of the paper trail, and that's pretty much it. I have to say that Jason Robards' performance is very overrated. There was more fun for me during any of Nancy Drew movies or JFK than what's contained in All the President's Men, so I am slightly disappointed about the outcome. If there is anything to complain about, I thought the information given was rather full of holes. A name just appears out of nowhere, and some juicy tidbit suddenly comes into play, disallowing audience's participation during the sleuthing trip of Woodward and Bernstein. Even worse, for somebody like me who is not very informative of what had happened that time, All the President's Men didn't fill in the details for me that well. I guess I'll need to read a book on that, if I am motivated to do so. All in all, All the President's Men is nevertheless a good film but not good enough for repeated viewings mainly because of the boredom factor.",N/A

1371081,"Father of my Children is one of the more moving and beautiful films I have seen in a long time.It is very difficult to summarize this film without spoiling the important sense of discovery. Gregoire is a very successful film producer. He and his wife Sylvia have two daughters, one a teenager the other much younger. About all that should be said, Gregoire is driven to succeed with his production company and obviously doesn't spend as much time with his family as he should. On the other hand, this is a family that loves each other deeply. Ah, the first level of bitter sweetness in this film.The film is truly a masterpiece in using the film language of folding a story over on itself. At almost exactly the halfway point of this film, the major dramatic event happens. Where the arc of the characters built up to that moment, they descend in the exact same manner to the conclusion. It's comforting to watch a film where the opening shots are replicated at the end of the film; it makes for such good closure.The acting is superb. Gregoire is played by Louis-Do de Lencquesaing, a French actor with a long history of films that didn't necessarily make it to the US (in Cache he was the store owner,Cache (Hidden)). He plays an intense but Bohemian creative person. Although he isn't treating his family the best, he is still an empathetic character. Chiara Caselli, an Italian actress (My Own Private Idaho: The Criterion Collection, andRipley's Game), is stunning as Sylvia. I loved her character the most; she is strong, intelligent, and tender all at once. Alice de Lencquesaing, (Summer Hours: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]) plays the oldest daughter. Her performance is the biggest surprise of the film. She follows beautifully in her mother's footsteps and is very believable with the character change she goes through.This film is not rated. There is a somewhat graphic scene that younger viewers might not understand. I imagine it would have had an R or PG-13 rating, based on that scene alone. A mature thirteen year old could easily watch this film.The directing of this film was excellent. Framing was well used and added to the drama of the film. Technically, this is an excellent film.I really love this film. It is not a happy film. The family demonstrates amazing emotion and power in front of some incredibly difficult odds. This is a rare example of really fine cinema.",N/A

1345633,"The Dragon Ball Season Five DVD box set includes five DVDs that contain thirty-one episodes.  The first four discs contain seven episodes, while the fifth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.  The emphasis on this set is Goku's training with Kami and Mister Popo to prepare for the next Tenkaichi Tournament, the actual Tenkaichi Tournament, and Goku and Chichi's attempt to save the Ox King and his castle after the castle ends up catching on fire.On the main menu of the first four discs, you can choose to watch all the episodes, watch the disc with the marathon feature, choose which episode you want to watch, and set up your language and subtitle options.  One of the best features of this set is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  In the setup menu, you can choose between English and Japanese audio.  You can also choose to turn the subtitles on and off.The menu on the fifth DVD adds in a link for the special features.  However, the features aren't very special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which are the same as what appeared on the first four DVD box sets), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for D.Gray-man, Mushi-Shi, The Slayers, Black Cat, Soul Eater, and S.A.V.E.Overall, the episodes on this disc are rather enjoyable.  The final few episodes wrap up the series nicely, and work perfectly to set the stage for the next series, Dragon Ball Z.  However, I was disappointed that FUNimation still insisted on splitting the episodes between the discs in an odd fashion.  It would have been nice if more of an effort had been made to split the episodes a little more evenly between the discs, especially since there's so little in the way of bonus features.While I'm a little disappointed by the episode breakdown of the discs and by the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball fans that want to own the series on DVD.In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",Dragon Ball: Season 5

1390808,"The shallow merits of The Tourist do little to remedy its paper-thin characterization, forgettable score, mismatched actors, and chronic identity crisis.  It is appropriately titled, however, in that the plot was no doubt contrived on a $14 coffee coaster in San Marco while the cast 'toured' Venice.  Meanwhile, the director incorporated a few mildly humorous segments of (PJ clad) Depp braving the Hotel Deniali rooftop, and runway model Jolie slaloming Venetian 'campos' like an Energizer powered Barbie doll.  The drum and French poodle were all that was missing.  Furthermore, the unremarkable script was saturated with clich&eacute;s and predictable eventualities, which conspired to poison the already non-existent chemistry between Depp and Jolie.  Even worse, the attempted blend of comedy, espionage, and Summertime(esque) romance only cannibalized its individual components and added to the confusion.  The effect was glitz and kitsch, not glamour and thrill.  The film also failed to showcase those subtle elements that make Venice the most awe-inspiringly romantic city in the world.  The result is a ""cinematic experience"" that utilized for its backgrounds shop-bought Venetian postcards.To be fair, there were a few witty lines like the ""ravenous/ravishing"" pre-dinner exchange.  Good stuff.  Had they been faithful to this lighthearted, comedic prescription and axed the absurd spy vs. spy subplot, the movie would have been more memorable.  Ironically, Timothy Dalton's minor role--owing to his ageless appearance and former work as 007--seemed to steal the show.If you're in the mood for a believable romance that truly captures the essence/charm of Venice, go rent David Lean's Summertime, starring Katherine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi.",N/A

871144,"Ok, I got this film because a friend recommended it, saying that these guys go around pretending to be executives from major corporations and then take responsibility for their company's misdeeds and make pledges tha would become a PR nightmare for the companies not to follow through with.I thought awesome! Cannot wait to see it! I'm as liberal as they come, and I could not wait to throw my support behind people doing something so controversial, yet nessecary (because let's be honest, liberals are good at being walked all over and pushed aside and that is about it; just not an effective group).So i watched this.... 50% of the movie is filler, not a good start. I was thinking maybe they accomplish a great deal like I had heard... They crash a fabrics marketing meeting in Finland with maybe 45 nobodies in attendance and try to crash another meeting in Australia that gets canceled because of lack of attendees? Seriously? Wow, slow down.Worse still, they dont put a great deal of effort into anything they do, (again, typical liberal), they don't work on their presentation until a few days beforehand, they don't plan anything and they accomplish nothing.But wait, it gets worse! Their satire is the most dumbed down, stereotypical garbage that no one but a stoner freshman in college who thinks they have the whole world figured out could appreciate. You know that guy, he is out in the quad playing the 3 cords he knows on his guitar with a copy of something by nitzche or some other ""tortured author"" trying to look deep and impress girls with no self esteem and daddy issues. If you hate that guy, you are really going to hate this thing.It is kind of sad because at first these guys seem really intelligent and especially well informed on the groups they wish to target. And I can ever get past the handy cam quality of the entire feature because hey, anyone who is trying to make a difference deserves all the recognition and support they can get. But this is a poor excuse for a pipe dream that acomplishes nothing. I see that they made another movie in my search, and maybe in that one they have evolved into the vigilante, corporation fighting heroes that others see, but I am so completely turned off by this first movie and it's juvenile efforts, that I have no desire to spend further time or money to find out.",N/A

1403446,"Check out the full review at Metal Arcade DOT NetBe aware that this review may contain some spoilers. DC Comics' Green Lantern makes his long awaited debut on the big screen. So how did it pan out?Not too great. I went into this movie with very low expectations based on the bad word of mouth it had been receiving. The movie never blew away those low expectations, either.Ryan Reynolds stars in this Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) directed, effects driven romp as Hal Jordan, the first ever human chosen to join the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps.Hal is a reckless, cocky pilot when the movie starts, and he seems to have pissed off most of the people in his life who care about him. Shortly after an accident causes him to lose his job, Hal encounters a dying alien named Abin Sur, who passes the Green Lantern torch to him before he dies, saying that the ring chose him as his successor. A Green Lantern must be responsible and fearless, and so Hal thinks that the ring has made a big mistake in choosing him.After the ring is bonded to him, Hal is sent to the Lantern's home world of Oa. It is there that he meets Sinestro, a great warrior who is resentful of Hal, whom he believes is unworthy of the legendary Abin Sur's ring. He is also greeted by Kilowog (Michael Clarke Duncan), a giant beast of a drill instructor, and the intellectual Tomar-Re (Geoffrey Rush). He is beaten down by Kilowog's harsh training and Sinestro's down-talking, and after being pushed too far, he quits, saying that the ring made a mistake in choosing him.Back on Earth, Hector Hammond (played by a nigh-unrecognizable Peter Skarsgaard), a highly intelligent professor and son of a senator (Tim Robbins), is visited by the government, who wants him to study the alien Abin Sur's body. While examining the body, he is infected by the fear energy that killed Abin Sur, by way of Parallax, a dumb looking Galactus ripoff, fueled by terrible CGI. Hal must overcome his fears of the past, his memories of his dead father's terrible plane crash, and now Hector and Galactus... erm, Parallax, if he's to make Sinestro proud and live up to his hype as a Lantern.The movie itself, however, far from lives up to its hype. With a director like Martin Campbell, who revitalized the aging James Bond franchise, you would think the movie was in good hands. However, this movie is just one more in the long line of 3-D driven special effects spectacles that try to cover up the film's lack of true substance and story. As you could probably tell from my long winded retelling of the film's setup, the story is terribly confusing, with too much going on, too many characters and too much CGI to distract you. This is DC's version of X-Men: The Last Stand (an arguably better movie).The CGI in the movie ranges from terrible to amazing. The time spent on the planet Oa, home of the Lanterns, is arguably the most well done, with thousands of cool looking alien species serving as Corps members and a beautiful skyline. Hal's training on Oa is by far the most interesting visually and story-wise. It's a shame Hal's time on Oa only accounts for about 15 minutes of this movie.Once Hector Hammond makes his debut as a dumb looking giant-headed, ugly ass guy in a wheelchair, the film becomes plain laughable. His character is far from intimidating, and I can't understand why they decided to put him in the movie. Near the end of the film he reveals his feelings for Hal's girl Carol (Blake Lively) and how he's despised Hal since they were kids- which seems thrown in at the last minute since the film makes no mention that they all grew up together. Sarsgaard's performance is hammy and terrible, and you just want his character to die a horrible death form the moment you see him. You'll understand once you see the film- he pretty much just wastes all the time he was onscreen, which could have been much better served on the awesome looking planet Oa.Likewise, the main villain, Parallax, is dumb, stupid looking, and not as intimidating as everyone in the movie makes him out to be. The final confrontation between Hal and this absurd looking villain could have been a great opportunity to showcase the cool looking ranks of the Green Lantern Corps, but I guess they ran out of CGI money there or something, because even Parallax himself looks like he was created by a budget, basement CGI team normally used for Sy-Fi channel garbage.Some people were complaining about Ryan Reynolds being cast in the role of Hal Jordan, but he is bar none the best thing in the movie. He is the only character you actually care about, and his acting ability and charisma are the only thing keeping this film from being totally unwatchable. Blake Lively is pretty good in her role, which doesn't give her much to do besides look pretty and have one cool Top-Gun style flight sequence in the beginning of the film.There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can't detail them all, even in this now close to 1000 word review. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, however Hal Jordan, one of DC's few well-respected characters, deserved much better. As it stands, Batman is still the only DC character with movies worthy of his comic pedigree, and that's a real shame.",Green Lantern
1380302,"Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou is known for his epic films such as ""Hero"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" and he also happens to be a fan of the Coen Brothers 1985 film ""Blood Simple"".  So, as a departure of the kind of films that Zhang is known for, a Chinese (loosely-based) adaptation of the film was created and ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" was born.Shot in Northwest China at the Gansu province, ""A Simple Noodle Story"" is a mixture of a dark thriller but also comedy.  Praised for its visual look and vibrant colors (as Zhang Yimou was praised for his use of colors in ""Hero""), ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" was nominated for a Golden Bear when the film had its international premiere at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.VIDEO:""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" is presented in 1080 High Definition (2:40:1).When Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" was released, the film caught everyone by surprise by its use of color and the overall vibrant colors were a magnificent accomplishment by cinematographer Chris Doyle.  And since then, every production, may it be for the Beijing Olympics, Chinese New Year or any film that Zhang Yimou has taken part in has embraced color.This time around, Zhang Yimou collaborates with his cinematographer Xiaoding Zhao, who he worked with previously in ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" and once again, color use in this film is magnificent.For one, the characters are wearing colors that pop.  Wang's wife in green, Li in pink, Zhao in orange and Chen in blue.  The background of where the film is shot is very close to these hills that are red and earthtone amber colors and those colors absolutely pop!Also, what I found amazing is the detail.  The details of the hills and mountain around the area, to the wood-based design of the noodleshop.  But you can also see the detail of the clothing and fabric.  The curvature of the police uniform that Zhang is wearing and everything is so detailed, that I found it to be amazing in HD.  And typically when you get these colors, you expect to see some banding and I didn't see any banding at all.  Nor did I see any crush, especially during the scenes with Wang (who tends to stay in the dark in the cellar).  Blacks are nice and deep, I didn't notice any artifacts or edge enhancement.""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" looks amazing in HD!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Similar to the picture quality, ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" has its moments where the lossless audio track really catches your attention.  Presented in Chinese Mandarin 5.1 DTS-HD MA, from the opening scenes with the cannonball being blasted or when a gun is being shot.  But where you will hear awesome audio is when the noodle shop is working and you can hear the flames through the surround channels, also the ambiance of the police men inside the restaurant or when they are traveling and you can hear the whirl from a fan that they are carrying.While the majority of the film is dialogue and music-driven and a lot of it through the front and center channels, you do get enough of noise coming through the surround channels as well and it's well-utilized throughout the film.  Even for little things such as Li's clumsiness as he keeps tripping, Zhang firing off arrows or hearing him unsheat his sword or trying to break into the safe, these moments really come alive as if it is happening right near you in real-time.So, overall, the lossless audio soundtrack is amazing.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" comes with the following special features:* Creating A Woman, A Gun and a Noodleshop - (1:59:14) Presented in standard definition, this featurette actually comprises of probably close to two dozen mini-featurettes.  This special feature goes through so many elements of what took place behind-the-scenes of the film and also featuring mini-featurettes focused on the director and the six major talents of the film.  From covering the costume design, casting, what the talent like to do during the off-time, singing, learning dance moves, stunt coordination and also giving us an idea of a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"".  But also to showcase how busy a director Zhang Yimou is because while he was working on this film, he was also working on a Chinese New Year event.* Theatrical Trailer - (1:55) The original theatrical trailer to ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"".JUDGMENT CALL:Absolutely enjoyable, fun and a bit twisted... ""A Women, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" was a pleasant surprise!If anything, Zhang Yimou is a fantastic filmmaker.  He knows what he wants, he has been able to create these visually fantastic films and also epic Chinese films but ""A Women, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" is a big surprise.  For one, I never expected to see Zhang take on a Coen Brothers film and do a loose adaptation of it.  And because of the departure from his previous films, many see this film as a way for the director to try something experimental, crazy but also a homage to the Coen Brother's 1984 debut classic but done in a Chinese way, using impressive and visually appealing colors.I have to admit, I'm still surprise by how he was able to take the storyline of the Coen Brothers' ""Blood Simple"" and transform this film to a Chinese period film.As mentioned, ""A Women, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" relies heavily on visuals, physical comedy, even the use of gags that may have been seen in '70s and '80s Chinese comedy/period films, these are not the type of films that Zhang Yimou is known for.  But he is able to craft this film, using ""Blood Simple"" as a blueprint and having fun with the storyline.  And to see this balance of comedy, vibrant colors to moments of dark twisted planning, with wonderful cinematography, beautiful costume design and also impressive set design as everything is shot with these breathtaking red/amber-colored hills and blue sky, this movie was not only artistic, creative and fun, it's another great film among the many awesome films in Zhang Yimou's oeuvre.  It's literally a work of art!And typically with many Chinese period films, there are so many characters and special effects that at times, the storyline can get convoluted or even derivative of past Chinese films but this time, the story is kept simple within six characters.  The visual storytelling and how each of these characters are displayed was quite fascinating.The performance by Honglei Sun as the police detective Zhang turned crooked and literally a murderer, was quite interesting and there is this sinister feeling that among the five other characters of this film, this lighthearted comedy was going to quickly change to a sinister, dark and twisted drama of who will be the last person standing?Actress Ni Yan does a wonderful job playing Wang's wife.  Submissive to him but also strong-willed in front of the employees, this is a woman who has been hurt so much by her husband that she seems to be staying because of the financial convenience.  The only person keeping her sane is the employee Li who has become like a good, listening friend for her.  Mischievous, playful but also a woman trying to find her inner strength.The comedian Xiao Shen-Yang does a wonderful job playing the paranoid Li.  A man who knows between right and wrong but yet feels sorry for his boss's wife and thus has her interests in mind, despite trying to keep his job at the noodle shop.  Li does his own stunts but just captures the look and feel of a paranoid man quite well!Dahong Ni as Wang is the elder man who is jealous that his wife is having an affair behind his back and now wants her gone.  Dahong Ni does a great job of playing the rich man who has power because of money and knowing he has control over his wife which he bought and over his employees.As for Ye Cheng as Zhao and Mao Mao as Chen, these characters are almost like characters that seem quite common when you watch a Shaw Bros. film.  But this time in a Zhang Yimou film.  Zhao is not very bright and has the big overbite, while Chen is the good friend of Zhao, who just works at the noodle shop and wants to keep out of trouble.The Blu-ray release is magnificent and once again, Sony Pictures Classics gives us an incredible visual film that definitely stands out amongst Zhang Yimou's previous, magnificent work.  The special features has plenty of mini-featurettes and about two hours worth of material on the making of the film and also showing us how life is quite busy for the world renown director.Overall, ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" was a fantastic film and also a refreshing escape from the kind of film that we are used to seeing from Zhang Yimou.  I'm not sure if I would qualify this film as being a masterpiece because of it's crazy use of comedy at times, but still, it was an impressive film that I can see myself coming back to quite often.Entertaining, fun, twisted and beautiful... ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" may be loosely-based on the Coen Brothers ""Blood Simple"" but Zhang Yimou creates a different but yet fantastic film all on his own. Visually impressive, fantastic cinematography... this film is definitely recommended!",N/A

I'm years late in viewing it but decided to rent it since it got such rave reviews and critical acclaim.#1 - The title doesn't fit the story#2 - The storyline is all over the place and the movie has no sound direction as to where it's going and why??#3 - Sad, morbid ending for no reason, pointless satire and just a horrible storyline all together.I started to turn the movie off before it ended but I was curion to see how it turned out since it got so many Oscars.

798509,"Arthur Kipps (Tommy Steele) is an orphan who's spent the last 10 years as an apprentice in a well-regarded draper's shop (what we might call a dry-goods or ready-made-clothing store) run by the miserly and tyrannical Shalford (Hilton Edwards), sleeping in the cellar with his three fellow apprentices (Grover Dale, Leslie Meadows, Christopher Sandford), trying to dodge his employer's ""'undreds of rules we must all obey,"" and carrying on a correspondence with Ann (Julia Foster), who was his best friend in the little country town where he grew up.  When a chance meeting with flamboyant actor/would-be playwright Harry Chitterlow (Cyril Ritchard) results in the discovery that he had a wealthy grandfather who on his deathbed decided to legitimize him and make him his heir, he can't take it in: the prospect of an income of 1250 pounds a year (approximately $337,000-374,000 in 2009 dollars) is so bewildering that all he can think of is buying ""somethin' I've wanted all me life""--a banjo!  But while being free of Shalford and being able to live as he pleases and buy what he likes is certainly pleasant, he soon finds that money brings problems he wasn't expecting.  Elevated into the ranks of the well-to-do, he has a whole new set of ""'undreds of rules"" to cope with, and even the sponsorship of Mrs. Walsingham (Pamela Brown) and her grown children Helen (Penelope Horner) and Hubert (James Villiers) doesn't make it easier--or pleasant.  He falls in love with Helen and actually gets engaged to her, resulting in a painful breakup with Ann--only to discover that the hypocrisy and high-toned manners of his would-be fiancee and her counterparts aren't for him.  But when he marries Ann and tries to make her happy, he discovers that it may not really be her he's doing it for--and she doesn't seem to appreciate it: she has no patience with what she calls the ""la-di-das"" of ""'igh society"" (""I know what I am...ordin'ry and natural...I just can't abide what's false and sham!"").  Then Hubert, who has become his financial advisor, turns out to have been speculating with his clients' money--and losing it.Steele, who began his career in music halls, is at his best in big, brash, loud production numbers like ""If I Had Money to Burn"" and ""Flash, Bang, Wallop (What a Picture),"" but perhaps because he actually came from humble roots, he can also convincingly portray the fish-out-of-water ""tradesman"" trying to find his way through the intricacies of Edwardian high society.  His Kipps is a very decent fellow at heart, who doesn't want to hurt anyone but can't seem to figure out how to keep his loyal friends from Shalford's while still enjoying his unexpected prosperity.  Though frank and generous, like many people newly promoted to wealth, he falls somewhat in love with his money and is resolved to not only make up for everything he's missed (which is understandable) but to put everyone around him in the shade; and because he's eager to blend in and be ""a proper gentleman,"" he's forced into a mold he doesn't really fit.  (It does seem a bit improbable that a country-reared orphan living in or near Folkeston would speak with a Cockney accent.)  Yet the movie's theme isn't so much that money doesn't buy happiness, as it is that happiness can be achieved with the aid of money as long as you remain true to yourself and mindful about what you really *need* and what you're just doing to impress other people.  The lavish costumery and settings are an added attraction.  It's unfortunate that the soundtrack is only available on vinyl.",Half a Sixpence

344418,"One of THE big P.O.W. movies in the U.S. was, of course, ""The Great Escape"" which was released in 1963. ""Hogan's Heroes"" started airing two years after that and Americans got a loopy idea of what life must have been like in one of those camps. ""The McKenzie Break"" was released in 1970 when Hogan was winding down and this gives a very different view of the way things were.Here's the scoop. The British P.O.W. camp is somewhere in the wilds of Scotland. The captive Germans are giving the British a hard time while they plan an escape that will allow them to hook up with a U-Boat off the Scottish coast. The Brits send in Brian Keith who plays a quite non-conventional officer, who happens to be Irish, to snoop around to see if he can figure out what the Germans are up to. Now it's a game of smarts and wills to see if he can foil the German officer, Willi Schlueter's, scheme.This is a cool flick. The Allies adhere to the codes of the Geneva Convention in their dealings with the Germans and it costs them. They do not have free reign over the camp, as one might imagine, and many Brits get hurt in trying to maintain order. Schlueter is foxy and does all manner of things to keep the Brits at bay in their own camp. He manages time and again to keep his plans well hidden. Brian Keith is no dummy either though. He goes toe to toe with Schlueter and it will come down to the last minute to see who wins the game.The production values are decent enough. Most of the action takes place in the camp which couldn't have cost that much to assemble. It has a look that was typical of it's time. It's shot and edited well enough. The sound is OK. I don't remember much of the music score so it must not have been appallingly bad. The acting is decent. They kept Keith's dialogue to a minimum as he did seem to struggle a bit with his Irish brogue.This is just a good cat and mouse kind of flick which moves along at a steady clip and has enough going on in the script to keep your attention. If you're at all prone to WW II kinds of flicks this should keep you happy.",N/A
1447871,I picked this movie up a couple of weeks ago and decided to watch it instead of watching the ravens get beat in Jacksonville this past Monday Night. I really enjoyed this movie even though you could tell it was a straight to DVD type deal. It had a really interesting story although at times it became a bit predictable . Christan Slater plays a real unlikeable cop I could definitely see him as my towns local cop.

But the show would also be missing a lot if the other characters weren't present. I love Jessie's independent, feminist personality though sometimes it was exaggerated a bit. Kelly character was great, she was so sweet and kind. Then there was Lisa whom was the assertive one, loved her style. Zack Morris was Just so darn handsome. Then Slater the sexy jock. I think screeh's character was the least liked, though his humor does get you laughing and in a good mood. I have all season of Saved by the bell on DVD,seasons 1,2,3,4, and 5. Though the quality of seasons 1,2,3,&4 weren't great, it wasn't bad either. The best seasons to me are 3 and 4. But with season 5 it was a different story for me, the DVDs showed a little too bright which is why I give it 4 stars but overall the show to me would be 5 stars.

576343,"L'avventura (1960), La notte (1961), L'eclisse (1962) and Il deserto rosso (1964) are Michelangelo Antonioni's (1912-2007) middle period films, by far his unrivalled best, better than his earlier ones, which are mostly neo-bourgeois rather than all neo-realist, and the later ones of his long life, which out of politeness I will not even categorise. They stand out like a monolith, and many find that the order of films also reflects the ranking of film quality, in descending order. I basically agree with that rating, though a recent reviewing of all films at least twice, I am not so sure whether ranking the films makes much sense.In a way, the topic of the four films is identical - alienation as the dominant symptom of modern life. The narratives seem to become increasingly emptier, and L'avventura perhaps is simply best because it balances verbal and nonverbal (camera, sound) action, and, of course, because Monica Vitti is a real novel actrice and a great natural talent (also in comedy, as her post-Antonioni films show). La Vitti, who plays key roles in all four, is also a key word: all acting in Antonioni's four films is superb - Jeanne Moreau and Marcello Mastroianni in La notte, and Alain Delon in L'eclisse, Richard Harris in Il deserto rosso - they all literally act beyond their known skills.Jeanne Moreau and Marcello Mastroianni play the disillusioned couple through face and body language, ""sans grimaces"", less and less words, more and more by physical environmental evidence: traffic (though a bit of a joke by today's ""standards""), metal/glass/concrete architecture. The two actors, like also Alain Delon, all very much at the top of their careers, escape clich&eacute;d acting. As good as his environmental (ie camera and sound) control is Antonioni's guiding of the actors - one is literally lacking words to express one's admiration.30 August 2011",N/A
304080,"Before I get into this, I'll start by saying that `Point Break' is ridiculously entertaining.  It is very much in the same vein as `The Fast and the Furious' or even Ben Affleck's latest directorial effort, `The Town'; both films apparently drawing major influences from Kathryn Bigelow's cult classic.  With that said; `Point Break' has some serious flaws (namely, the horrendous acting) that take it down a notch.  It is still well worth watching, and I'd totally watch it again, but I can't say that this is great.I mean, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey AND John C. McGinley in the SAME MOVIE.  Talk about the trifecta of horrendously bad acting.  They even share scenes together.  When the three of them unite it's like the world stops spinning and all the heads of those listening to them force emotion explode in unison.Like, totally dude!It's sad when the most reputable actor in your cast is Patrick Swayze, a mediocre talent at best.  In fact, this film's `acting' is saved by the little known Lori Petty, who just sizzles as the spunky Tyler.Back to the film itself.`Point Break' centers on Johnny Utah, a young cop recently assigned to the Bank Robbery division of his LAPD.  Soon he gets sucked in, by his partner Pappas, to go undercover as a surfer to catch a gang of notorious bank robbers called The Ex-Presidents.  They've robbed a ton of banks in three years' time and have never been caught.  They're too smart for that.  Pappas is convinced they have to be surfers thanks to one of the culprit's tan-lines and some wax he found scuffed on a bank counter.  Johnny now has to acquaint himself with the surfer crowd, which comes easier than he expected thanks to a hot young thing and her ex-beau.  Johnny soon finds himself getting caught up in the mentality of the surfer crowd, that of a spiritual connection to the sea, but as he closes in on The Ex-Presidents he becomes torn between his old life and the new one he just started.Keanu Reeves is one of those actors who tries way to hard.  I love how Petty's character Tyler calls Johnny (Reeves) out for looking so serious all the time.  That is Keanu in a nutshell.  He looks so serious, but he sounds so goofy.  He can't deliver his lines with any real conviction.  It doesn't help that he's saddled with some terrible dialog (""You have to go down!"").  Busey has been reduced to a joke in recent years, but apparently he was a decent actor in the 80's, or at least he was that one time when he received an Academy award nomination for playing Buddy Holly.  Outside of that, he rarely receives much praise.  In fact, the best thing he does in this film is punch John C. McGinley in the face (something I've wanted to do for years) so, yay for him.  McGinley is a horrific actor who has one gimmick he overuses to no end.  It was funny the first three times I watched `Scrubs'.  It's not funny anymore and yet he can't stop doing in.  I didn't realize he did it with every character he plays.  Those long running monologues with minor vocal fluctuations without taking a single breath just aren't effective; at all.UGH, but poor acting choices can't take away from the adrenaline rush that comes from this slickly directed film; and the brilliant cinematography (equal parts sun, sand, water and hair) make for a captivating ride.  Like I said, I will TOTALLY watch this again but to say that this is a great movie would be a stretch.",Point Break VHS

1354487,"Most of the necessary ingredients were there so this should have been a successful film.  Billed as a Sci-Fi/Adventure, this 2009 New Zealand production though, is anything but successful.  Fantastic special effects aside, the story feels incomplete, the pacing is odd, the sense of urgency slips from time to time with unnecessary distractions, the dialog was everything except informative, and the acting uniformly dull (Sam Neil in particular looked as if he wanted to be somewhere else doing anything but this movie.).  The only element that worked was the spooky shape shifters living next door.  If the rest of the movie had managed to capitalize on that instead of splintering off into a lackluster teen angst movie of the week this might have worked.  Instead, with too many things that didn't make sense, this movie just drifted from one inexplicable scene to another: the `split' of the twins was arbitrary and forced, the sequence in the police station useless, why did the aunt and uncle keep disappearing?  In addition, some of the reactions to danger were obscenely ludicrous (who, upon hearing their neighbors want to kill them, just go to bed.  Or, while your front door is being broken down, just stand there and watch until the intruder is upon you!?).  Crazy.
